any notion about the title, with the exception that all of the pieces
are stone sonatas to various degrees.


"These Antiquities are so exceedingly old that no Bookes doe reach them,


so there is no Way to retrive them but by comparative antiquitie, which
I have writt upon the spott, from the Monuments themselves."    John
Aubrey  (1626?1697)

Callanish Stone Circle


Isle of Lewis, Scotland



On this island, a sea?sliver
The Macleods, our name later,
Would prize as defensible,


We don't have a name except Picts,
The peoples, and it is enough
We can stand stones on point.


When cut these fell out
In slender daggers tipped at
An incising angle.  Sandstone


Can gleam as gold, hold pockets
Of quartz, though we have no
Word for that but clear and


Sharp and careful as that would
Split away to its own mind.
She came to see our standing stones


And told me that our members have
Been turned, in her, in our minds,
And then she laughed, said all


This work pointed out what
We needed, the straight line thrust
Into nowhere.  That woman knows


Too much our chief says and I
Agreed, but I like her way
Of running spirals in the places


Of our love. But you must see
Our stones on the coast, dozens
In clear, concupiscent blue


Of late autumns we have here,
Engorged in the condensed light
Of those short days, their shadows


Are dark daughters.
