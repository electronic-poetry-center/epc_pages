<p>That progressive chord<br>

<p>A smiling defiance, </p>
<p>at least that's how we try and sell it.</p>
<p>A kind of <i>apnea aforethought</i>.</p>
<p>A wishful drag<br>
  on the free flow of<br>
  the falling.</p>
<p>And is there no relationship<br>
  between what happens to you<br>
  and what you happen to do?</p>
<p>A case of gross exceptionalism.<br>
  A revolting ascendancy.<br>
  The monotone behind the tocsin.</p>
<p>If it was only a case<br>

  then, a page a week<br>

<p>When they said "crush" for the first time,<br>

  the vans with no windows,<br>
  the special clips and rosettes.</p>

  proffering excuses:</p>
<p>"If two is the recommended dosage,<br>

<p>It's not work that we're used to.</p>
<p>What work would be?</p>
<p>A kind of Travelers Aid.</p>
<p>A monstrous pageant<br>
  of fleeing suspects.</p>
<p>Here, the overgrown cuts,<br>
  the telephone poles,<br>
  the tooth picks and dead hangers<br>
  of a typical secondary market<br>
  conspiring now to shut out the light<br>
  that we are convinced<br>
  we were promised.</p>
<p>Instead<br>
  formed up in a hollow square<br>
  at the designated place.</p>
<p>And how had <i>he</i>,</p>
<p>of all of us, the most careless,<br>

  terrible life,</p>
<p>how had he remained at large<br>

<p>Brushing up against it,<br>
  the full-blown,<br>
  the leafing out.</p>
<p>It's like a condition,</p>
<p>but we keep at it, for "love of the craft,"<br>
  because "we think this is important."</p>
<p>So here we are,<br>
  year after year,<br>
  repeating---</p>
<p>"I just live for <i>this</i>."</p>
<p>A strange sinking of heart,<br>

<p align=center>Gorgeous Plunge</p></font>

<p align=center>Michael Gottlieb</p>

</font><font face="Times, Times New Roman, serif" size=3> 

<p align=justify></p>

<p align=justify>Given the format of "language" and all the resonance of that 

  inexorable surface, Michael Gottlieb leaps from echo to "every aging minute"&#8211;and 

  onward, leaving a shimmering track of impressive brilliance. Words never had 

  it so good nor did anyone ever so track them to their lair, wherein they at 

  last cry out, "I&#8217;d like to say," or "Having said that," or "You never 

  know." &#8211;<i>Robert Creeley</i></p>

<p align=justify></p>

<p align=justify>In Michael Gottlieb&#8217;s <i>Gorgeous Plunge</i>, poets are 

  the "we" of it. My generation at last, vanishing on the horizon. It&#8217;s 

  poetry&#8211;squibs of it, streams of it, pithy spoonfuls and dropped doses&#8211;one 

  last squeeze of the tube&#8211; that narrates by position of its clock hands&#8211;much 

  like the narrator does in Robert Musil&#8217;s epic <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>&#8211;the 

  difficult and even giddy moment in which one faces one&#8217;s culture and understands 

  in a mute turning, what it is to be a man. &#8211;<i>Eileen Myles</i></p>

<p align=justify></p>

<p align=justify>In the continuing battle between life and death at the end of 

  the century, Michael Gottlieb&#8217;s <i>Gorgeous Plunge </i>declares itself 

  on the side of life. As a phenomenal account of self-consciousness within structures 

  it can only partially authorize, Michael Gottlieb&#8217;s work addresses the 

  broad horizons of utopia, the chilling defiles of the economy, and the scrutable 

  immediacies of everyday life. &#8211;<i>Barrett Watten<br>

  <br>

  </i>Michael Gottlieb is the author of eight books of poetry including <i>Local 

  Color/Eidetic Deniers</i>, <i>Ninety-Six Tears</i> (also published by Roof Books), 

  <i>New York</i> and <i>The River Road</i>. His work has appeared in magazines 

  and anthologies for the past twenty years. In the late 70s and early 80s he 

  helped edit one of Language Poetry&#8217;s seminal periodicals, <i>Roof Magazine</i>. 

  A child of the suburbs, Michael Gottlieb presently lives in Northwestern Connecticut 

  with his wife and two children.</p>
