<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aliens have inhabited my aesthetics for <br />
decades. Really since the early 70s. </p>

<p>Before that I pretty much wrote <br />
as myself, though young. But something </p>

<p>has happened to my memory, my <br />
judgment: apparently, my will has been </p>

<p>affected. That old stuff, the fork <br />
in my head, first home run, </p>

<p>Dad falling out of the car --  <br />
I remember the words, but I </p>

<p>can't get back there anymore. I <br />
think they must be screening my </p>

<p>sensations. I'm sure my categories have <br />
been messed with. I look at </p>

<p>the anthologies in the big chains <br />
and campus bookstores, even the small </p>

<p>press opium dens, all those stanzas <br />
against that white space -- they just </p>

<p>look like the models in the <br />
catalogs. The models have arms and </p>

<p>legs and a head, the poems <br />
mostly don't, but other than that </p>

<p>it's hard -- for me anyway -- to <br />
tell them apart. There's the sexy </p>

<p>underwear poem, the sturdy workboot poem <br />
you could wear to a party </p>

<p>in a pinch, the little blaspheming <br />
dress poem. There's variety, you say: </p>

<p>the button-down oxford with offrhymed cuffs; <br />
the epic toga, showing some ancient </p>

<p>ankle; the behold! the world is <br />
changed and finally I'm normal flowing </p>

<p>robe and shorts; the full nude; <br />
the scatter -- Yes, I suppose there's </p>

<p>variety, but the looks, those come <br />
on and read me for the </p>

<p>inner you I've locked onto with <br />
my cultural capital sensing device looks! </p>

<p>No thanks, Jay Peterman! No thanks, <br />
&quot;Ordinary Evening in New Haven&quot;! I'm </p>

<p>just waiting for my return ticket <br />
to have any meaning, for those </p>

<p>saucer-shaped clouds to lower! The authorities <br />
deny any visitations -- hardly a surprise. </p>

<p>And I myself deny them -- think <br />
about it. What could motivate a </p>

<p>group of egg-headed, tentacled, slimier-than-thou aestheticians <br />
with techniques far beyond ours to </p>

<p>visit earth, abduct naive poets, and <br />
inculcate them with otherworldly forms that </p>

<p>are also, if you believe the <br />
tabloids, salacious? And these abductions always </p>

<p>seem to take place in some <br />
provincial setting: isn't that more than </p>

<p>slightly suspicious? Why don't they ever <br />
reveal themselves hovering over some New </p>

<p>York publishing venue? It would be <br />
nice to get some answers here --  </p>

<p>we might learn something, about poetry <br />
if nothing else, but I'm not </p>

<p>much help, since I'm an abductee, <br />
at least in theory, though, like </p>

<p>I say, I don't remember much. <br />
But this writing seems pretty normal: </p>

<p>complete sentences; semicolons; yada yada. I <br />
seem to have lost my avant-garde </p>

<p>card in the laundry. They say <br />
that's typical. Well, you'll just have </p>

<p>to use your judgment, earthlings! Judgment, <br />
that's your job! Back to work! </p>

<p>As if you could leave! And <br />
you thought gravity was a problem! </p>

1</p>

<p>Unclose your eyes, you look ridiculous, <br />
untip your head, shut your lips. </p>

<p>Listen. I'll tell you a secret. <br />
I learned this when I left the <i>shtetl</i></p>

<p> -- that means home town, <br />
everyone's from the <i>shtetl</i>. That bottle </p>

<p>you're clutching. In the <i>shtetl</i> it's called <br />
the bottle of last things. </p>

<p>Everyone gets one. It's supposed to <br />
be invisible, it's bad luck to mention it, they say. </p>

<p>But take it down from your mouth. <br />
You didn't know you were holding it! </p>

<p>They say that's good luck, <br />
and the tighter you close your eyes the better. </p>

<p>The world in there, all yours: <br />
visions, powers, messiahs. </p>

<p>Now that you know -- hoist it back up, <br />
run your tongue around the rim, <br />
feel the glass, if it's beveled smooth, <br />
curl your tongue into the neck, <br />
do whatever. It's yours. </p>

<p>But the big secret is . . .<br />
It's empty! Glug glug! </p>

<p>You've swallowed it all! Tasted good? <br />
Who knows! All gone! </p>

<p>Bottoms up must have been <br />
your very first word! </p>

<p>And guess what that means? <br />
Bad luck! </p>

<p>Finis! Curtains! Triumphal openings, Picasso elbowing over to chat --  nothing, forget it! </p>

<p>I've found out the hard way. <br />
But at least I'm not in that ridiculous posture anymore, <br />
squeezing the neck, eyes screwed shut, piously sucking. </p>

<p>Here's my advice: throw it away. <br />
smash it on the curb, <br />
go heave it through some stained glass. <br />
Just get rid of it! Now: </p>

<p>head level, mouth shut, eyes open, <br />
forward march . . . we're big doomed heroes!</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>God can give you the world <br />
(glug glug!), sacred word, covered ark and all, </p>

<p>I can paint you <br />
pictures of whatever -- curtains blowing open, <br />
nice tablecloths, high class space, <br />
sides of meat, streaming red, glistening, clotted yellow. </p>

<p>Push the paint, whip it around. <br />
It likes it. A strip-tease </p>

<p>without the tease and without stopping at the skin. <br />
The girl thinks I want to see her body -- </p>

<p>surprise! Keep your clothes on, sweetie, </p>

<p>you're here to wave away flies. <br />
They're actually pretty, patchy fur swarming </p>

<p>over the side of beef if you <br />
let them settle, but it's </p>

<p>much prettier bare. <br />
Keep waving. </p>

<p>Your arms are killing you? So what. <br />
After four days hanging there it doesn't <br />
smell so great? </p>

<p>Hey, my blood didn't taste so great <br />
when the god-fearing neighbors beat me up </p>

<p>in the name of the almighty. <br />
Thou shalt make no graven images </p>

<p>and thou shalt smash the kid <br />
who tries to paint the rabbi </p>

<p>and here's one for free <br />
in case anybody forgets what No means.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Let's build a frame of common <br />
sense, stating the case with deeply </p>

<p>received ideas and fields of trophies <br />
to hold the still-warm ashes, yes? </p>

<p>What's happening? Soutine, non-verbal painter <br />
of crooked landscapes, people, meat, is speaking, </p>

<p>supposedly, but it can't be, time <br />
is a problem, and place, </p>

<p>one's place in the senses, facts of habit, recognition, <br />
situations where art is produced, carefully broken windows </p>

<p>placed at careful distances <br />
from customers who are always right. </p>

<p>The dramatic monolog is far down on the list <br />
of living forms, supine, disgusting really. </p>

<p>What is an anecdotal Soutine to me, <br />
and what am I to these </p>

<p>acidic bursts of no one's speech </p>

<p>and they to the decomposing composition? <br />
The desire for heroic writing splits </p>

<p>into appetite (glug glug!) and horror <br />
at the achieved sentence (keep waving!), </p>

<p>while the eye (your mind or <br />
mine?) sticks the words like pigs, </p>

<p>with syntax underneath to catch the <br />
flows of meaning. The taste </p>

<p>of lost things is a tyrannical pleasure <br />
and is always in infinite supply. </p>

<p>4</p>

<p>For the sake of art, <br />
modernist coffee, Paris, </p>

<p>it would be nice <br />
to hold some things separate, </p>

<p>let the anxious animal graze outside forever <br />
on museum grass </p>

<p>while, inside, history's waterfall flows upward, <br />
sharp white walls </p>

<p>keeping the vision of taste safe <br />
from the mouth that wants grapes  </p>

<p>perpetually bursting into the old original wine: <br />
Make It New. </p>

<p>The Louvre <br />
is the <i>shtetl</i> of <i>shtetls</i>. </p>

<p>Unless our home <br />
is language, raising us </p>

<p>inside its womb. Reading its shifting glitter <br />
I almost forget I ever learned </p>

<p>to write in half-lit <br />
rooms and blocks and days. <br />
There are lives outside </p>

<p>the correction chambers of this page. <br />
Couldn't it be stronger? Time </p>

<p>to stop and name. Print <br />
on paper for the neighbors.</p>

to drive a Ford in the specific direction </p>

<p>of heaven where art <br />
is a very good investment, </p>

<p>although you only should say that <br />
well after the fact. </p>

<p>In 1955 the many love the few <br />
or at least the few are free to think that they do </p>

<p>and &quot;it was a very good year,&quot; <br />
the present recording its pleasure in being </p>

<p>recorded. Frank Sinatra is rewarded <br />
with a stage full of panties and keys </p>

<p>while standing up and swaying, <br />
his inward light spotlit smokily, <br />
throat open to extort <br />
every sung syllable, <br />
the bedroom board meeting <br />
smoldering, shareholders on fire, <br />
humming along. In 1955, art is <br />
as exciting as the perfect bid, <br />
the sunsoaked homerun, <br />
the victory over the others <br />
that they like too, acknowledge, buy, <br />
put on the wall. </p>

<p>Kids wait, <br />
but the early offscreen doors don't reopen.</p>

<p>                    17th shot (voiceover)</p>
</blockquote>

<i><p>The Manchurian Candidate</i> stars Frank Sinatra <br />
as Benny Marco, Lawrence Harvey as </p>

<p>the horrible Raymond Shaw, Janet Leigh <br />
as Benny's girlfriend, Angela Lansbury as </p>

<p>Shaw's mastermind mother. American soldiers are <br />
betrayed in Korea, and captured by </p>

<p>the Chinese Communists. After offscreen brainwashing, <br />
they are shown to the Russians. </p>

<p>Both groups are intellectuals, quoting conflicting <br />
studies as the commonsense Americans sit, </p>

<p>bored but patient, in alternate shots, <br />
brainwashed into thinking they're at a </p>

<p>horticultural meeting in New Jersey where <br />
matrons in white dresses and broad </p>

<p>flowery hats are attending a lecture <br />
extolling scientific gardening. &quot;Another modern discovery </p>

<p>which we owe to the hydrangea <br />
concerns the influence of air drainage </p>

<p>upon plant climate.&quot; Slow modern harpsichord <br />
jangles the soundtrack. The film is </p>

<p>racially progressive: when the onscreen American <br />
soldier is black, his hallucinated matrons </p>

<p>are uppermiddleclass black; there's no plantation <br />
subtext. When Shaw is ordered to </p>

<p>strangle another soldier, he's almost too <br />
polite, saying &quot;Excuse me&quot; as he </p>

<p>brushes another's chair; the soldier to <br />
be strangled is polite, too. It's </p>

<p>a liberal utopia: good manners have <br />
triumphed over competition. The Chinese are </p>

<p>jovial and authoritative -- they've perfected the <br />
procedure. They can make the Americans </p>

<p>believe anything: the Camels they're smoking <br />
turn out to be yak dung. </p>

<p>It is to laugh, for the <br />
Chinese mastermind at least. The Russians </p>

<p>are surly and badly in need <br />
of dental work. You can't believe </p>

<p>what you see. But you have <br />
to look. Finally, the poem is </p>

<p>beginning to focus. We know you <br />
know what we're saying to you.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- I hit my head; I had a dream. Isn't that how it always starts?</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- Maybe that's the way it starts in the West. It's not a collective form; there's no rhetorical place for people to come together. That's the way you've started, but that's not the way it's supposed to start. Hitting your head is personal.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- I was cutting the grass and I hit my head on the branch of an apple tree. An old one, twenty-five feet tall with two live quarters sprouting north and south, two dead ones east and west. It was not symbolism, only matter. If you don't believe me, you can feel the ridge of healing flesh on my head, under the fur here. It's as real as history. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- Cutting the grass is a fairly trivial instance upon which to balance the non-concentric circles of history. Go in, I would have said, have a little lemonade, &amp; read Whitman or the Misty poets. Particulars only exist by being collective.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- So the public -- fuzzy little me in the case of your remarks -- becomes crucial.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- When you're a nation, being cute is not enough any more. No, a public is a serious, collective enterprise. The ironic single writer in a cage, treasonous, or loyal, or mad, riven by pathos, unfamiliar tears . . . it doesn't really matter much to the words or the world. Once the hypnosis of the singular is snapped, that is. Before, one can think that anything might happen on the page.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- I'm willing to bob for very small favors, balls of hard, candied poetry swimming almost ethically in the sweat of irony's personal furnace around which individuals are gathered into gendered masses in lieu of lives for all lived under the changeable blue fields of utopia otherwise known as international justice!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- International justice! I think we might as well change the subject, don't you?</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- Fine. Which do you hate more, symbolic poetry, or   poetry that's all language? </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- Easy: poetry that's symbolic. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- But what about poetry that's all language? </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- Poetry that's all language makes me cry when I'm asleep and can't hear the tears hitting the pillow, I mean the page. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- I actually hit my head: that means something. It was hot, I was one body for the duration, cutting the leaves of grass and I saw myself walking on air on cloud stilts of biological perpetuity and sweat of the word. I was not a nation, I was not a species, I was a speaker, fully alive just because I like the sound of that the       noisome hiss of this making a made world under me undergo  twisting birth and destruction just to keep me saying what I was going to say anyway! Or anything else! Or nothing so what black hole blank! An apple an unoriginal rhetorical sin a day goes astray into the many minds of the many many others who don't think this! And neither do I! Neither we nor me! Am I allowed to say this? No! I say it! Thanks to the body beyond species, beyond genre, thanks to the dictionary, the strikers, the Haymarket        lexicographers! The Tiananmen Square grammarians! I say it! Out loud! Where was I? Where are we? Don't you love the intrusion of speech where no speech can be, life where sounds are the slippery start to never finish but get there already anyway . . .</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- Did you show that to your trainer before you turned it loose on me?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">KOALA -- My teacher? </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">PANDA -- I'm assuming your teacher was your trainer before he was your teacher.</p>

<p>I can see eyes painted open <br />

America, my life, the page, <br />
the academy of the future, <br />
which, as it turns out, <br />
is in the past. They even move. <br />
They're mine: that was home. </p>

<p>It's plain that there was time <br />
and that it took place <br />
but its quick pleasures are now words <br />
in a language with only scattered survivors. </p>

<p>A single word means nothing. </p>

<p>Or a line without a world. </p>

<p>The present is full of survivors' sentences. <br />
With disoriented conviction and memory <br />
too deep for instrumental speech <br />
swimming sinkingly toward pre-owned futures <br />
hosed down the hyperspace of capital <br />
where freedom spells the rampant logos <br />
turning attractively bemused typefaces and icons <br />
toward the traffic. </p>

<p>Or language it for yourself. <br />
Make your own recipes: ironize, <br />
experiment, write wrong, <br />
but don't forget <br />
the old pleasures: <br />
skies, turkeys, playgrounds. </p>

Meanwhile, one drives, <br />
an open lane a paycheck of sorts, <br />
leading to the autobiography glimpsed <br />

keeping the public world private </p>

that's the lesson scorching the director's desire </p>

<blockquote>
<p>                    21st shot</p>

<p>The Chinese mastermind has the one <br />
successful marriage in the movie. <br />
(Yes, it's offscreen: you can't have everything.) </p>

<p>He's really a most happy fella. </p>

<p>We rejoin him as he leaves <br />
the Russian doctor-spy's so-called clinic in NYC <br />
after ordering Shaw to murder <br />
his would-have-been father-in-law, the honest muckraking journalist, <br />
as well as the love-of-his-life blonde. <br />
Don't fall asleep, <br />
this is plot. <br />
Everyone has to sacrifice. </p>

<p>Except for the mastermind perhaps, <br />
jauntily tugging his gloves tight, <br />
saying now he has to get off to Macy's <br />
for some Xmas shopping. <br />
Smiles the happy social smile sans dissonance: <br />
the wife gave him a list yea long, <br />
shrugs: what are you gonna do? </p>

<p>He knows how to get in bed with capital <br />
and let it charm his pants off. <br />
Having them &quot;tight enough <br />
so everyone will want to go to bed with you,&quot; <br />
as Frank O'Hara writes, is a youthful gesture <br />
under the dappled shade of capital's <br />
frond-like pleasances. </p>

<p>That's one thing. <br />
But to live as a large system of control is quite another. </p>

<p>As the mastermind leaves, the Russian stares. <br />
He just doesn't get it: <br />
he believes in history <br />
not Macy's, inexorable direction, totality, <br />
the concrete-translucent materiality of class to classless truth, <br />
one world one history at the end! </p>

<p>Meanwhile one's provisional oneness <br />
stands and waits with oblique conviction <br />
against the waterfall of wage-slaves<br />
 -- that rainbow spray is guilty as Sunday! <br />
Those sunny lakes, those caves of ice, <br />
those miracles of rare device <br />
forced from the deep romantic chasm <br />
of bourgeois pastoral-pornographic shopping, <br />
which that crypto-individualist Chinese mastermind indulges<br />
with his credit flowing past the respectful cashier <br />
like vodka down a mule's throat! <br />
Or whatever! </p>

<p>Thus the Russian revolutionary-bureaucrat-murderer-actor <br />
placed on the verbal screen <br />
by the all-too-human history of this shot. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>                    closing shot </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shaw's gunsight targets <br />
Communist McCarthyite foster father's forehead, </p>

<p>as said before, though in a novel continuum. </p>

<p>The movie wants to reach the new world <br />
and, in the same gesture, </p>

<p>to conclude. A narrative should hold you <br />
with intimate concern, but not too close </p>

<p>because you'll be heading out one day, <br />
pegged, looking back </p>

<p>for the recognizable trees, the known cars, <br />
glad animal movements traded in <br />
for manageable novelty . . . </p>

<p>Is the nostalgia for creation or destruction, <br />
or for something that hasn't happened yet? </p>

<p>Beside the encrusted place names, <br />
flags of private longing <br />
flutter against the vistas, <br />
and molecular revolutionaries dream of taking all desires to court <br />
and setting them loose beneath the robes of judgment. </p>

<p>To pull the gown from knowledge,<br />
to pull the eye from noon,<br />
and not to see the catered wants <br />
of Tom, Dick, and Harry <br />
navigating the street, the mall, the clicker and the dust!</p>

<p>And Jane, Ketisha, and those tender technocratic shoots and stumps, you and me? </p>

<p>On screen, nations personify the pursuit of happiness, <br />
tearing families to shreds and the shreds <br />
to costumed certainties of  loss and rage. <br />
Beyond the blinds: <br />
the end -- rain falling on cue, <br />
Frank Sinatra crying, Janet Leigh wordless. </p>

<p>The days regular as sprocket holes, <br />
while decades slide by <br />
with unevenly layered minds of their own. </p>

<p>You! Hypocrite viewer! With nothing but mirrors <br />
for pleasure, knowledge, luck. <br />
My hand in yours if you read me. <br />
Those deprogrammed people glimmering beyond <br />
the evening's blocky conspiracy theories, <br />
willing their present without shooting our past <br />
to a bloody parable <br />
 -- have you found a way to call them yet?</p>

I always expected some kind of <br />
indefinite continuance but it turns out </p>

<p>my body was smaller and more <br />
attached to its beginnings than I </p>

<p>thought. So the world will end <br />
up breaking apart. No surprise there,  </p>

bit shocked all the way through: </p>

<p>familiarity has its charm, as real <br />
as sex, and it's a lot </p>

<p>more spread out. I'll jot down <br />
some lasting impressions -- sorry -- last impressions. </p>

<p>Last night I caught a fragile <br />
glimpse of the writing surface of </p>

<p>dreams: it was like a sheet <br />
of water I could feel as </p>

<p>an edge my body interrupted; I <br />
was in a pool, sticking out, </p>

<p>and when I wanted anything, felt <br />
desire as the words say then </p>

<p>the edge would disappear -- it would <br />
be the same temperature as me and </p>

<p>I'd find myself back in the <br />
story. Which was? Something about getting </p>

<p>published. There was a tall building, <br />
downtown San Francisco where they assembled </p>

<p>flyers to be distributed in laundromats. <br />
These were frequented by large immigrant </p>

<p>populations as well as disgruntled aristocrats <br />
back from the ex-colonies. Then I </p>

<p>was in the laundromat, naked, washing <br />
the books I managed to save </p>

<p>from the war. These were quite <br />
sturdy, as you might imagine. The </p>

<p>sex practices of the sixties, set <br />
to music by Marianne Moore and </p>

<p>Jimi Hendrix. People would study these, <br />
as well as other power sources: </p>

<p>wind, sun, linebreaks. Once a page <br />
would get clean enough then I </p>

<p>could write on top of it. <br />
Like now: fake dreams, skittish prophecy --  </p>

<p>it doesn't matter as long as <br />
the breath comes a little quicker, </p>

<p>and the pulse firms and skips: <br />
not too much: the door between </p>

<p>centuries turns out to be quite <br />
narrow. An Egyptian Pulled Glass Bottle </p>

<p>in the Shape of a Fish; <br />
Six Words to Name a Nipple. </p>

must be the future. So long. </p>

<p>January 19: No contact this morning. <br />
The Pope and I were going </p>

<p>to have lunch at what he <br />
said would be &quot;The Waldorf.&quot; We </p>

<p>walked there through a somewhat subaqueous <br />
New York: sweating walls, women in </p>

<p>Hawaiian shirts, men in aprons with <br />
beads of perspiration on their cheeks. </p>

<p>Suggestion of mold everywhere, most surfaces<br />
carrying hints of blue, green, silver. </p>

<p>Some low lintels even had seaweed. <br />
The Pope was wearing his full </p>

<p>outfit: his miter of course made <br />
him look quite tall and his </p>

<p>robes puffed him out sideways too. <br />
I asked him how he was </p>

<p>handling the humidity. He said it <br />
was all Gore-tex, gesturing toward his </p>

<p>robes as we strode along. We <br />
laughed. But I didn't hear the </p>

<p>swishing sound Gore-tex makes: his clothes <br />
were quiet. We got to &quot;the </p>

<p>Waldorf,&quot; which was a Greek place, <br />
the &quot;W'orf.&quot; It really was something </p>

<p>of a wharf. We sat at <br />
a table made from a large </p>

<p>wooden spool, the kind for holding <br />
miles of phone wire. The ceiling </p>

<p>was low, decorated with fishing net <br />
and red and green colored lights. </p>

<p>We looked out at some dark <br />
view that had water in it. </p>

<p>He ordered fried calamari and so <br />
did I. So now the time </p>

<p>had come. &quot;What about Jesus Christ?&quot; <br />
I asked him. &quot;He's supposed to </p>

<p>have come down from heaven, and <br />
I'm not interested?&quot; The Pope finished </p>

<p>squeezing a wedge of lemon onto <br />
his sandy curlicues. He kept looking </p>

<p>at what he was doing as <br />
he spoke, although in fact he </p>

<p>had finished doing it. &quot;The file <br />
cabinets were ordered a long time </p>

<p>ago. They thought they were very <br />
big at that time. Nobody's allowed </p>

<p>to look in them, anyway. Look, <br />
I'm enjoying my squid. How's yours?&quot; </p>

<p>Yes, mine was pretty good too. <br />
I noticed his English was unaccented. </p>

<p>How come no hint of Polish? <br />
&quot;I'm universal,&quot; he said. We laughed. </p>

<p>January 17: Nothing. Scraps. Can't remember. </p>

<p>I was marching in the avant-garde <br />
army. We were on a dirt </p>

<p>road leading to Trenton. It was <br />
sunny, well-tended farms, beets doing well, </p>

<p>tomatoes, peppers, and we had momentum. <br />
The occasional Model-T pulled off to </p>

<p>the side to let us by. <br />
People were wearing more or less </p>

<p>what I'd read about. The Baroness <br />
was wearing purple metal; her breasts </p>

<p>were aggressively festooned. Pound wore a <br />
brown suit; tall and dowdy, he </p>

<p>joked that he was president of <br />
Ohio State. He took some buckeyes </p>

<p>from his pocket: &quot;You can't eat <br />
em, but you can't beat em.&quot; </p>

<p>He closed them tightly in his <br />
fist at the punchline; I heard </p>

<p>him repeat the routine. Eliot wore <br />
a kind of lederhosen jogging suit: </p>

<p>shorts and suspenders but made out <br />
of soft grey shoddy. In fact </p>

<p>his suspenders broke, as one could <br />
easily have predicted. He stopped, shamefaced </p>

<p>as his chestnut leather undershorts were <br />
revealed. He fell out and began </p>

<p>doing fast continuous pushups. He was <br />
short and quite strong. He pistoned </p>

<p>with a cartoon intensity which, it <br />
became clearer with every stroke, wasn't </p>

<p>going to go away. We left <br />
him there. Marianne Moore wore a </p>

<p>long white gown with a dildo <br />
tucked in a slot right above </p>

<p>her buttocks. No, it was a <br />
tight scroll, which she could unroll </p>

<p>and read, although only a few <br />
words at a time, as they </p>

<p>were highly acidic. She had a <br />
short haircut, walked fast &amp; happily. </p>

<p>The skirt-material was canvas, she thrashed <br />
it from inside, it billowed. She </p>

<p>was sailing. I was next to <br />
the Baroness. She turned to me, </p>

<p>playfully but intently rubbed some metal <br />
on her breast against my arm. </p>

<p>It was hard to keep the <br />
sense of tableau from sliding: we </p>

<p>were walking forward at some clip. <br />
She said this was my &quot;inoculation.&quot; </p>

<p>She laughed, revealing a gaptoothed mouth, <br />
problems: brown teeth, purple gentian stain. </p>

<p>Then she sucked my arm: &quot;To <br />
compose you.&quot; She had a whistle </p>

<p>hanging between her breasts. She took <br />
it, blew hard: some people came </p>

<p>with a wide litter: &quot;Come on,&quot; <br />
she said, while we all continued </p>

<p>marching forward, &quot;You need to get <br />
particular.&quot; She hopped up weightlessly. Dreams </p>

<p>are more unfair to the dreamer <br />
than to the dreamed, I thought, </p>

<p>heaving myself up after her. Once <br />
I was up there, she looked </p>

<p>at me sharply: &quot;You think this <br />
is the avant-garde? You don't know </p>

<p>where the edges are. Where do <br />
you think these guys are heading? </p>

<p>Trenton! &#145;Trenton Makes and the World <br />
Takes!' The avant-garde? Professionalization! Reviewing! <br />
&#9;Reproduction! </p>

<p>Look. See the wisps? Khlebnikov is <br />
burning his last book. He's not </p>

<p>in the army. There. In the <br />
middle of the cabbage. What a  </p>

<p>bad dad.&quot; She laughed. &quot;He's set <br />

<p>Fake. False. Faux. For the archive. </p>

<p>January 28: We were going to <br />
have sex in the stacks. We </p>

<p>were in the 800's, standing eagerly <br />
amid the old copies of the </p>

<p>Romantics. Looking at the dark blue <br />
spines of Wordsworth's <i>Collected</i>, I thought </p>

<p>how the intensity of his need <br />
to express his unplaced social being </p>

<p>in sentences had produced publicly verifiable <br />
beauty so that his subsequent civic </p>

<p>aspirations seemed to have importance enough <br />
for him to become Poet Laureate </p>

<p>and how his later leaden writing <br />
upheld that intensity and verifiability, only </p>

<p>instead of searching wind and rocks <br />
and retina for the sentences of </p>

<p>his social being, he chirped his <br />
confirmed lofty perch to other social </p>

<p>beings in lengthy claustrophobic hallelujahs for <br />
the present moment. There are devices </p>

<p>to keep it still, long enough, <br />
and he had learned them. Rhyme </p>

<p>was a burden, crime was unambiguously, <br />
explainably wrong, time had snuck around </p>

<p>behind him. He had carved his <br />
own anxiety into a throne and </p>

<p>now he was stuck on it, <br />
remembering sadder days when he had </p>

<p>wanted to be happy with a <br />
purity that made him blink, thinking </p>

<p>back. He remembered in a trance: <br />
the past seemed unbearably near. Our </p>

<p>more slippery, contrapuntal hallelujahs were planted <br />
in the immediate future, only a </p>

<p>few buttons, zippers and a little <br />
elastic down the road. We had </p>

<p>first snuck into the men's room <br />
but it had been crowded with </p>

<p>two intensely separated men hunched at <br />
urinals 1 and 6. We turned </p>

<p>to hurry out, and you pointed <br />
to the magic marker graffiti on </p>

<p>the beige tiles: &quot;This place needs <br />
a women's touch&quot; answered by &quot;FINGER </p>

<p>MY ASSHOLE, CUNT!&quot; This second message <br />
had been modified by an arrow </p>

<p>indicating &quot;CUNT&quot; was to be moved <br />
from behind to before &quot;ASSHOLE&quot;: &quot;FINGER </p>

<p>MY CUNT, ASSHOLE!&quot; We were eager <br />
to prove syntax was not mere </p>

<p>vanity and that bodies could use <br />
it to resist the tyranny of </p>

<p>elemental words. And wouldn't it be <br />
nice to get knowledge and pleasure </p>

<p>on the same page. So we'd <br />
hurried out to the deserted 800's.</p>

</i></font><font face="Times, Times New Roman, serif" size=3>
<p>February 24:  Yesterday there was weather; <br />
tomorrow there will be none. I'm </p>

<p>in an academic office, surrounded by <br />
screens, each with a keyboard attached. </p>

<p>The screens depict scenes in cities; <br />
I'm to type in words. I </p>

<p>type &quot;PLAY&quot; and a section in <br />
the southeast of one city blows </p>

<p>up: a seven-story parking structure and <br />
a big boxy sewage treatment facility </p>

<p>with its attendant pond goes boom: <br />
a grainy spray of particles expands </p>

<p>up in a vee and then <br />
falls while the sound system produces </p>

<p>a sharp burst of static until <br />
the particles have vanished, leaving a </p>

<p>tan crater. &quot;GUILT,&quot; on the other <br />
hand, creates a whole flat small </p>

<p>town on a screen which had <br />
shown &#145;verdant' forest. I see a </p>

<p>little car moving down &quot;Main Street.&quot; <br />
It stops and makes a right. </p>

<p>I go over to a third <br />
screen with a generic New York   </p>

<p>City and type &quot;I LIKE HORSES&quot; <br />
but nothing happens. &quot;I GET OFF</p>

<p>ON THE HORSES OF INSTRUCTION THE <br />
HELL WITH THE MARLBORO MAN&quot;: still</p>

<p>nothing. Apparently syntax cancels out the <br />
effects. Okay, so just plain &quot;HORSES.&quot; </p>

<p>Anything? Yes, a tiny pup tent <br />
has appeared in the lower righthand </p>

<p>corner, on the sidewalk in front <br />
of a department store. I try </p>

<p>&quot;I&quot;: a second pup tent. &quot;LIKE&quot;: <br />
a third. The power of writing </p>

<p>in this particular game is starting <br />
to feel, shall we say, illusory. </p>

<p>An authority (dressed in blue) is <br />
in the doorway with three large </p>

<p>yellow envelopes. He is holding them <br />
out to me; none have return </p>

<p>addresses and the authority is both <br />
offering and withholding them. It is </p>

<p>mail/not-mail (perhaps one is a letter <br />
bomb). I can see the address </p>

<p>on the top envelope -- it was <br />
written with a sweeping gesture by </p>

<p>someone using a two-tone (red and <br />
silver) pen and shows great flourish, </p>

<p>I know from this that the <br />
top envelope contains a literary magazine. </p>

<p>Suddenly I feel deeply vexed; tears <br />
start, though I hold them, and </p>

<p>I feel dizzy. I don't know <br />
about the other two envelopes. I </p>

<p>don't take them. I gesture toward <br />
the screens. &quot;You take a turn,&quot; </p>

<p>I say. But he pauses, &quot;a <br />
turn&quot; doesn't compute. He seems to </p>

<p>feel the screens and keyboards are <br />
a site fraught with dignity and </p>

<p>heroic challenge. I offer him a <br />
cigarette. He takes it with earnest </p>

<p>gratefulness. As I offer the match <br />
he's in bureaucratic heaven inhaling with </p>

<p>rapt concentration. I drop the pack <br />
to the floor, squash it, rubbing </p>

<p>it heavily with the ball of <br />
my foot until tobacco and paper </p>

<p>are spread. Tears are flowing down <br />
my cheeks. He's smoking, wide-eyed, silent. </p>

<p>Soon I'm standing on the grass <br />
near home, which is set amid </p>

<p>an array of terraced gardens. Other <br />
people are there, including T. Three </p>

<p>times in quick succession a terrific <br />
thunderous roar fills the air and </p>

<p>the ground rumbles and shakes. We <br />
all know then that hundreds of </p>

<p>miles away great monsters have emerged <br />
from the ground. They are reptilian </p>

<p>but insect-like, giant ants with nimble <br />
alligator limbs. It is comforting to </p>

<p>know they are &quot;hundreds, maybe thousands&quot; <br />
of miles away, but eventually they </p>

<p>will come; it's common knowledge that <br />
they particularly hate poets. Their most </p>

<p>fearsome posture is when they arrange <br />
themselves into words. They can get </p>

<p>us at a distance that way. <br />
We talk nervously, trying to inhabit </p>

<p>our seconds with the timbres of <br />
our voices; we make long sentences; </p>

<p>we gesture and laugh as accurately <br />
as we can. Timing is crucial.</p>

<p>December 25: I was at Putney, <br />
it was beautiful.</p>

<p>Reuben was graduating, <br />
this was the end of my close involvement.</p>

<p>Francie was on one side, <br />
Chloe Deal on the other.</p>

<p>Do you need another woman in your twosome, <br />
I'd volunteer.</p>

<p>Not consequential, <br />
dream kept unrolling.</p>

<p>I went over to George Iffington with the tortoise shell glasses and <br />
&#9;plastic hair, <br />
he mumbled.</p>

<p>He was full of literary talk, <br />
did he know who I was?</p>

<p>Brecht would write a play, he dismissed, <br />
then a novel.</p>

<p>Never stuck with anything, <br />
that was his problem.</p>

<p>I leaned up close,  <br />
heard nothing but class.</p>

<p>Then Robert Lowell drove into the diningroom in his stretch limo, <br />
Iffington got in as Lowell ranted. </p>

<p>&quot;<i>Can</i> you write better than Sid <br />
Kunitz, Bob Berryman? That's the only </p>

<p>question it makes any sense to <br />
stammer back to.&quot; He swerved sharply </p>

<p>to avoid a buffet table, but <br />
didn't quite make it. A tailfin </p>

<p>hurled a tray of cold cuts <br />
to the floor. &quot;The answer is </p>

<p>you, manic, self-born, self-deceased, performing for <br />
also-dead papa, stuck up over the </p>

<p>stage like a lead eagle, eyes <br />
welded shut to render judgment all </p>

<p>the more unanswerable. So you dance <br />
to that blindness, type your flintlock</p>

<p>accuracies into that stone page. If <br />
you dislike those odds, long as </p>

<p>a loser's memory, then face backwards <br />
and wait for the future to </p>

<p>commence. Don't blink, you'll spoil. Meanwhile <br />
the missiles bristle like red, white </p>

<p>and blue thistles, or the Cold <br />
War's over, isn't it? Mine is. </p>

<p>I'm overexposed now, with critics crawling <br />
between my lines. Get a life,</p>

<p>then get it over with! Follow <br />
me, you bad singularities, worse infinities! </p>

<p>If you want a career, die!&quot; <br />
The car nosed significantly against the </p>

<p>wall and he backed up, leaving <br />
a silver smear on the splintered </p>

<p>pine boards. The left headlight was <br />
smashed. &quot;1946, 1966, the pricks stuck </p>

<p>a crown on a head that <br />
was barely mine. The wavering ceilings </p>

<p>of home! And so I was <br />
elected king of poetry and lived </p>

<p>more or less ever after in <br />
the castle where they manufacture awards</p>

<p>without labor, far down in the <br />
upper middle reaches. It's all done </p>

<p>by Santa's literary elves with their <br />
mirror-powered pleasure-centers and delicate feeding tubes, </p>

<p>pressing the bar, spreading the word, <br />
North Pole on south, Satan's auratic </p>

<p>face on the dust-covers. Dust to <br />
dust for the industrious poets. Microbes </p>

<p>of culture carbuncling the prairie that <br />
knows no trough above the nightly</p>

<p>news. My native massacres! All for <br />
a few dozen home runs, a </p>

<p>few hundred creamy hotels. That's not <br />
all I wanted. I'm not boring </p>

<p>you by any chance? Dead men's <br />
rants are the worst, stuck in </p>

<p>traffic, suing the dictionary.&quot; By now <br />
the diners were up and shouting </p>

<p>as he zigzagged rapidly. He hipchecked <br />
one, who flew sideways, and then </p>

<p>caught another flush in the back, <br />
dragging him under the front wheels. </p>

<p>&quot;I myself am fame, hard, gemlike. <br />
Or was. Mention me outside, if </p>

<p>there still is one. The cock<br />
is crowing and the reviewless dawn </p>

<p>begins to glare. Here, take the <br />
wheel. Islington? Stifflington?  -- No license? Anxiety's</p>

<p>December 2:Nick and Nora were in Hershey <br />
for their honeymoon; they even toured </p>

<p>the chocolate factory the first afternoon. <br />
Of course there were martinis before </p>

<p>and smoke after sex, like the <br />
movies said. Her cigarettes and his </p>

<p>cigars re-asserted personal Alleghenies of taste <br />
under the omnipresent smell of chocolate. </p>

<p>The putative 3-D of the thin <br />
clouds was an almost satisfying picture </p>

<p>of the unpredictable organizations of imagination. <br />
And then the taste, the ash </p>

<p>of the usual wants, making their <br />
tongues a touch ugly and articulate </p>

<p>in the midst of desire, stirring <br />
the whole kettle, at least a </p>

<p>layer or so down. But pleasure <br />
was much bigger than their bodies, </p>

<p>and, after they had had their <br />
particular fill, they began to notice </p>

<p>the chocolate air again. They lay <br />
back and stared up at the </p>

<p>off-white silk of the canopy. Tasks <br />
lay ahead, inert, scattered, and the </p>

<p>more they thought about them, the <br />
more urgent. &quot;You know, there's Kingston </p>

<p>in San Fran, and Hughes in <br />
Harlem. They're not getting any clearer.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Train schedule?&quot; &quot;In my jacket.&quot; Nick <br />
gestured over toward the ornamental desk </p>

<p>the hotel provided. He fell back <br />
and sighed. &quot;Chocolate. Think you'll ever </p>

<p>be able to stand it again?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Yeah, huh?&quot; &quot;&#145;Yeah': you're very </p>

<p>perceptive.&quot; Nora reached for a bar <br />
on the bedside table, opened it, </p>

<p>and broke off a piece. She <br />
put it to his lips, pushed </p>

<p>herself onto him to free her <br />
other hand, which she used to </p>

<p>open his mouth. He resisted, but <br />
she edged a thumb and forefinger </p>

<p>in and stretched insistently. When it <br />
was open enough she laid the </p>

<p>square of chocolate on his tongue. <br />
&quot;Feeding time.&quot; Then she closed his </p>

<p>lips, pinching them and sliding them <br />
back and forth across each other. </p>

<p>&quot;See. It's good.&quot; She watched his <br />
tongue moving inside and grinned when </p>

<p>she saw him swallow. He answered <br />
through compressed lips, &quot;Yeah, it's good.&quot;</p>

Sixteen thousand four hundred and forty five, <br />

<p>I've changed my mind. <br />

<p>Sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty <br />

Does that man beat that woman or just read the paper? </p>

<p>It's too late to retrace half thoughts. <br />
They sounded intriguing, but are written <br />
sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty two. </p>

<p>What a triumph it would be to get to 17,000. <br />
I've thought that more than once <br />

though never in that form, <br />

with word-to-world marriage <br />
as a sacrament to be placed <br />

<p>Human the life <br />
the seconds of the same, <br />

dogeared sounds spell the golden mean <br />
throughout the greater Philadelphia area, <br />
Louisville proper, <br />
London per se, <br />
the place placed here <br />
to mean to be. </p>

<p>Sensual awakening in even the best books, <br />
short dirty looks, <br />
wife's warm thigh touching just now, <br />
sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty four. </p>

<p>Got a lot of work to catch up on tonight <br />
sixteen thousand four hundred sixty five <br />
sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty six. <br />
And I don't want <br />
to cheat myself <br />
of any of it <br />
sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty seven. </p>

<p>Sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty eight, <br />
I escaped <br />

the rubble from the best imperial jokes <br />

Good, I think. That is, if <br />
I can read your writing. There's </p>

<p>something about curving ink that makes <br />
meaning crawl back to the cradle </p>

<p>where fancy lies in wait, its <br />
codicils quaint squiggles the next morning. </p>

<p>It's like reading the weather in <br />
epitaphs. The sound on the page </p>

<p>always about to, a gleam in <br />
the ear, in the dark with </p>

<p>the light on, breathing . . . but night <br />
has fallen deep inside the national </p>

<p>lie, a kind of pocket of <br />
victimized economic membrane, leaking hometown blood. </p>

<p>The green is featureless, the caddy <br />
mutinous. The gatekeeper reads old scores </p>

<p>by the glow under the door. <br />
This is great, and you are </p>

<p>lovely, that is, if I'm reading <br />
your body the way it wants. </p>

<p>Appetites and sirens contrapuntal on the <br />
street. People outside the shelters read </p>

<p>the sentence that says I live, <br />
you live, everybody else can fight </p>

<p>for what's left. Atrocities float above <br />
the depths of the news cycle. </p>

<p>The stringer at the shore drowns <br />
another typo, feeding the calm of </p>

<p>an order floating above its past <br />
like a menu above a terrace. </p>

<p>Dinner and counting stars. Categories are <br />
courtship, of a sort, Jews left, </p>

<p>Armenians right. The palace is up <br />
to something, but the officals keep </p>

<p>filing out. Technically, the day has <br />
been punished enough. Its history has </p>

<p>been smuggled into the sky badly <br />
smudged. Those who can, go home.</p>

<p align="CENTER">so that you will notice nothing but my body </p>
<p align="CENTER">and its chosen prosthesis, </p>
<p align="CENTER">its hand, its ear, its mouth, its solar anus, </p>
<p align="CENTER">its Lawrentian phallic godhead, its Kahlo-esque song of its other, </p>
<p align="CENTER">its computer, its macro, its chosen form, </p>
<p align="CENTER">in a word, </p>
<p align="CENTER">its poetics.</p>
<p align="CENTER">And once it's off I'll leave it on the floor shimmering and quivering </p>
<p align="CENTER">and asking to be sensually mourned </p>
<p align="CENTER">and in the performance of said mourning </p>
<p align="CENTER">I will do an unnamed dance to the supersession </p>

<p align="CENTER">along my naked body </p>
<p align="CENTER">and your desire will pull you </p>
<p align="CENTER">toward me and toward the meaning </p>
<p align="CENTER">of all your prior sentences.</p>
<p align="CENTER">And the future will lie down </p>
<p align="CENTER">with the past. </p>

<p align="CENTER">Under the naked aegis </p>
<p align="CENTER">of this spectacular identification </p>
<p align="CENTER">I will swell and connect in unmeasured strains, leaping </p>
<p align="CENTER">with bound feet, found objects </p>
<p align="CENTER">and verbally mandated politics -- that's a joke </p>
<p align="CENTER">and you're a great audience -- or the next one </p>
<p align="CENTER">will be; and the one after that even better -- </p>
<p align="CENTER">deeply in bed with the loftiest leftiest clouds, je ne sais pas, </p>
<p align="CENTER">mujer de mi hijo, hija de mi hija, leaves, hojas, </p>
<p align="CENTER">the never to be seen future</p>

<p align="CENTER">shimmering and quivering to be sensually mourned </p>

<p align="CENTER">to music I also am remembering. </p>
<p align="CENTER">Thus the future will shine out </p>

<p>Where language is, there <br />

<p>who smiled, hand over <br />
&#9;heart, pledging perception's daintiest <br />
&#9;&#9;favors, far back and <br />

<p>are in eternity, too, <br />
&#9;with their pieces of <br />

<p>for so long now, <br />
&#9;the past humps up <br />
&#9;&#9;until it can only be <br />

<i>CHAPTER FOUR </i></p>

<p>The absence of theory pulses in my neck, <br />
at least I've thought so, <br />
sitting on the edge of the bed, pulling off my socks.  <br />
Break the life-mask of empiricism and, underneath, prophecies <br />
become visible: the death of the past, swaddled in <br />
old jargons of self-expression, those other bodies. </p>

<p>The next layer down we find a typewriter, <br />
at least in my case, <br />
the platen nubbled in a grid where the breath habitually roosted. <br />
So you work away, dusting and smashing alteratively, <br />
a kind of rhythmic settling of ever older scores <br />
like an eye sinking into its socket. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<i>CHAPTER FIVE</i></p>

<p>Which reminds me. There was this <br />
South Seas island, and in the </p>

<p>alley, after the shows, they'd gather, <br />
to wait for the stars. So </p>

<p>this one person is there, staring <br />
at the bricks, not really seeing </p>

<p>them, the invisibility of the obvious, <br />
et cetera, etc. In some versions, </p>

<p>they're classes. Class: I met some <br />
of my best friends in class. </p>

<p>And so the one brick says <br />
to the other brick, &quot;You ever </p>

<p>see a shrink? And the second <br />
brick says, If I saw a </p>

<p>shrink the whole wall would be <br />
in big trouble. And the first </p>

<p>brick says, I hate to be <br />
the one to break the news, </p>

<p>but you're not that important. And <br />
brick number two says, Touch&eacute;, and </p>

<p>big deal, too. Touch&eacute; away all <br />
day, and I'd hardly feel it. </p>

<p>But how about you? Did you <br />
ever see a shrink? And the </p>

<p>first brick says, Yes, it so <br />
happens that I did, one time. </p>

<p>I go in there and the <br />
shrink says, You need to find </p>

<p>the inner you, that'll be one <br />
hundred dollars, and I say, You're </p>

<p>kidding, the inner me is in <br />
no way different from the outer </p>

<p>me, if you don't know that <br />
from the get-go then what am </p>

<p>I doing here? Touch&eacute;, says the <br />
shrink, you're right, it's been a </p>

<p>long day, and you're not my <br />
last brick. And then I say, <br />
Now if you're going to be <br />
asking for my sympathy then you </p>

<p>should be paying me, how about <br />
we make it ninety bucks, because </p>

<p>I'm not one to copy your <br />
material. Ha ha, says the shrink, </p>

<p>but that one I've heard before. <br />
No, what I meant to say </p>

<p>is you've got to find the <br />
real you. Forget inner. Real hooks </p>

<p>up with the material conditions among <br />
which consciousness undergoes its traumas and </p>

<p>desires, and it can lose its <br />
shape, easily. Well, I say, I've </p>

<p>heard that one before, and it <br />
was in a better version, too. </p>

<p>I mean, &quot;material conditions among which <br />
consciousness&quot; -- who do you think is </p>

<p>still listening at that point? You're supposed <br />
to be helping people, not getting </p>

<p>it, whatever &quot;it&quot; is, right, whatever <br />
&quot;right&quot; is, so the teacher won't </p>

<p>take out his red pen and <br />
get your paper all bloody.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<i>CHAPTER SIX</i></p>

<p>Anyway, the way the better version <br />
goes is when you say, That'll </p>

<p>be one hundred dollars, then I <br />
say, When I find the real </p>

<p>me I'll get him to pay <br />
you, and then you're supposed to </p>

<p>say, It's not that simple, -- Wait, <br />
how does it go from here? </p>

<p>Ah but that's why you're here,<br />
interrupts the shrink, to get access </p>

<p>to those repressed memories. Then maybe <br />
you can find the real you. </p>

<p>Shut up, I explain, so I <br />
can remember how it goes. You</p>

<p>say, It's not that simple . . . Wait.<br />
Oh yes. Then I say in</p>

<p>answer to that, You're right, who <br />
knows who is who, I don't </p>

<p>know who I am, and you <br />
don't know who I am, I </p>

<p>could be anybody, I could be <br />
you, maybe I owe myself one </p>

<p>hundred dollars, who knows? and maybe <br />
you're me and you owe me </p>

<p>one hundred dollars, who can say, <br />
but I'll tell you what we </p>

<p>can do, let's just split the <br />
difference, you give me fifty and </p>

<p>we can call the whole thing off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<i>CHAPTER SEVEN</i></p>

<p>Which except for the usual allowances <br />
is pretty much exactly the way </p>

<p>I heard it,&quot; says the brick. <br />
And speaking of identity. Once there </p>

<p>was a Jew, a Serb and <br />
a Samoan, in a lightbulb, when </p>

<p>it starts raining, first only a <br />
few drops. But it turns out </p>

<p>that one stands for ten, ten <br />
means a hundred, and then the </p>

<p>uncountable masses of others who maybe <br />
kick your skull around if you </p>

<p>get too close. In some versions <br />
it's a soccer ball. A whistle </p>

<p>blows. You touch my mirror and <br />
boom: Seven centuries of annoyed family </p>

<p>epics, nothing but episodic payback with <br />
crescendoing spirals of blood blocking exactly </p>

<p>the same arteries and messing exactly <br />
the same stony thoroughfares. This thinking </p>

<p>with things as they exist, what <br />
good does it do anyone not </p>

<p>yet born? Back in my century, <br />
back in the matter with me, </p>

<p>I flew, like other poets, we <br />
signed our letters and sold them, </p>

<p>kept them, lost them, gave our <br />
love to particular people, meant by </p>

<p>this something like I'm touching the <br />
keys and this once they are </p>

<p>not as cold as some medieval <br />
suet, blessed and eaten, damned and </p>

<p>waiting for the future where the <br />
dead are already buried en masse </p>

<p>by judgments already made, beneath lobs <br />
of fundamental meaning smashing bridges with </p>

<p>aimless accuracy, probing the most removed <br />
non-readers for the smell of their </p>

<p>heirs. Give my love to their <br />
particular cases in particular places, which </p>

<p>I can't see from here and <br />
so I also have to lob </p>

<p>the whole mass forward with undifferentiated <br />
obsessesiveness, into what looks illegible. Until one</p>

<p>day, a day that will <br />
never die, since it only exists </p>

<p>in the past and the future, <br />
with my body blocking the otherwise </p>

<p>perfect symmetry,</p>

</i></font><font face="Times, Times New Roman, serif" size=3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Adding my pee to the sea <br />
of rhyme, it's time I admit sameness </p>

<p>is a bit of a hoax. <br />
Yes, my body lies over social oceans </p>

<p>like yours and slightly like Rover's, <br />
except he barks to speak and we </p>

<p>speak to bargain and intermingle. All's <br />
translation in love and war. Do you </p>

<p>hear the joke about the marriage of <br />
true mind to impediment after impediment? </p>

<p>That's what we call &quot;language,&quot; at <br />
least around here. What rhymes with &quot;rhythm&quot;? </p>

<p>&quot;Mythic&quot;? You have to squint to <br />
hear it. Squint and scatter letters to </p>

<p>the five senses, shake off circumstance, and <br />
find yourself in words: squatting amid </p>

<p>ashes while the wicked affluent legislators <br />
dress for the ball. Your feet ache </p>

<p>and stink. The thought-track wakes and thinks: <br />
novelty again, the same old novelty. </p>

<p>It's almost worse than royalty. My biographic <br />
foot in the glass shoe -- fate </p>

<p>or d&eacute;j&agrave; vu? The rhythm of <br />
days produces chill, stupor, and after considerable </p>

<p>training, a bunch of personal pronouns. <br />
It's Thursday, history's late as usual. Meanwhile, </p>

<p>some sort of sexual traffic jam <br />
has been goading us all into public </p>

<p>revelation. Offstage, Fact slapped Value on the <br />
butt, and said, Break a leg, </p>

<p>make a killing, show those suckers <br />
where to suck. And Value answered, Don't </p>

<p>be vulgar, Fact, unless you're speaking personally. <br />
As for me, where the bee </p>

<p>sucks, there suck I, a mean-er, <br />
a be-er, an arriviste tooling down that </p>

<p>divided highway heading where none, they say, <br />
ever returns. And when I don't </p>

<p>come back, say I told you <br />
everything about yourself except the future, lie </p>

<p>alone in our bed of roses <br />
whence, they say, poems arise, to amuse </p>

<p>the students when we've gone to prose. <br />
I'd say more but you hear </p>

<p>those stuck horns blaring: that's been <br />
my cue ever since I can remember. </p>
