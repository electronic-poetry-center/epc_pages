Publications:  "A True Relation of the State May Last, 1616" by Mary Hilton.
Using text from John Rolfe's writings on Jamestown, this work explores the
responsibilities of settlement and the creation of a new homeland.

"The Haunted Baronet" by Mark Wallace.  Inspired by Sheridan Le Fanu's ghost
story of the same title.  According to Wallace, "The seventeen poems here are a
way of taking the vocabulary of 'The Haunted Baronet' and seeing what it says
now.'  The result is stunning, mysterious, and haunting in its own right.
