<P>If the first book was an opening, the second is a continuation and a
movement into future works. It is the celebration of a coming into fullness
the realization in some sense of beginnings from still earlier in the century.
And yet the poetry like the time itself marks a sharp break from what went
before, with World War II and the events of Auschwitz and Hiroshima creating
a chasm, a true aporia between then and now. It is on the near side of that
paradoxical break that our own lives first come in - not outside history
this time but living in and through it. The years the book covers are those
of the cold war and its aftermath and, viewed from where we are, the time
too of the second great awakening of poetry in the century now coming to
an end. The story told is one that we have lived in and have found never
to have been truly told, neither in its triumphs nor its failures (with
an affection for the failures sometimes as great as for the triumphs). If
ideas like that guided our first book, they will more strongly dominate
our second, where we can no longer act as distant and objective viewers,
but as witnesses and even partisans for the works at hand.</P>

<H4>1 A work resuming &quot;in the dark&quot; ...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The gathering (to use the title of one of Robert Duncan's last books)
begins &quot;in the dark&quot;: a mid-century of molten cities and scorched
earth, of chimneys blowing human ashes through the air, of slaves in labor
camps and gulags, of nations enslaved to other nations, of racism and apartheid
rampant.1</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In that darkness the brilliant, often strident promise of an earlier
avant-garde was no longer visible or viable. The surge of totalizing governments
and the resultant state of war had decimated the former avant-gardes - in
Germany and Russia, Italy and Japan, as in the conquered lands of Europe,
Africa, and Asia. The stakes for some were death or exile, for others an
underground resistance and continued struggle, for still others (all too
often) a collaboration with the very advocates of power and repression that
their work had set out to oppose.</P>

<P>The half century that followed witnessed a continuous wave of wars and
repressions, interspersed with rebellions and occasional luminous victories
that for the moment seemed to light the darkness.2</P>

  <P>3 &quot;Pound, Lawerence, Joyce, H.D., Eliot, have a black voice when
  speaking of the contemporary scene, an enduring memory of the first World
  War that has revealed the deep-going falsehood and evil of the modern state.
  ... Their threshold remains ours. The time of war and exploitation, the
  infamy and lies of the new capitalist war-state, continue. And the answering
  intensity of the imagination to hold its own values must continue.&quot;
  (Robert Duncan, quoted by Nathaniel Mackey)And William Carlos Williams:
  &quot;Poetry is a rival government always in opposition to its cruder replicas.&quot;<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The wars of the time were not only the American conflicts in Korea and
Vietnam and the forty-year long cold war but hundreds of other regional
conflicts, wars of independence, revolutionary guerrilla wars and uprisings,
genocides, mass slaughters, cultural wars fueled by ideology and, increasingly,
by ethnicity and religion. And with this too there was the sense of a natural
world under continuing attack or lashing back with new plagues and hitherto
undreamed-of biological disasters.</P>

<P>This was the darkness that came through, along with whatever other forms
of darkness and of light that moved within the cosmos or the individual
psyche. &quot;Poetry therefore as opposition,&quot; Nanni Balestrini wrote,
within a neo-modernist, experimental framework. &quot;Opposition to the
dogma and conformity that overlays us, that hardens the tracks behind us,
that entangles our feet, seeking to halt our steps. Today more than ever
is the reason to write poetry.&quot; And Pierre Guyotat, as a further marker
of the poet's relation to the art as such and to the sense of earlier betrayals:
&quot;The very origin of the whole system of literature has to be attacked.&quot;</P>

<P>In the United States, where experimental modernism had yet to make its
ineluctable breakthrough, the first postwar decade was marked by an ascendant
literary &quot;modernism&quot; - hostile to experiment and reduced in consequence
to a vapid, often stuffy middle-ground approximation. It was in that sense
the Age of Eliot (T.S.) and of the <I>new</I> critics, as they were then
called - not as an extension of Eliot's collage-work in <I>The Waste Land</I>,
say, but as a dominant and retrograde poetics in which the old ways of the
English &quot;great tradition&quot; were trotted out and given privilege.
The mark of that time, revived in every decade since, was a return to prescriptive
rhyme and meter: a rejection thereby of the uncertainties of <I>free verse</I>
and the barely remembered <I>freed words</I> of a Mallarm&eacute; or Marinetti.
Wrote the poet Delmore Schwartz, as one of those then in ascendance: &quot;The
poetic revolution, the revolution in poetic taste which was inspired by
the criticism of T.S. Eliot ... has established itself in power.&quot; And
he gave as an example of new poets writing in &quot;a style which takes
as its starting point the poetic idiom and literary taste of the generation
of Pound and Eliot,&quot; the following from W.D. Snodgrass:</P>

<P>- at which David Antin looked back and commented (circa 1972): &quot;The
comparison of this updated version of <I>A Shropshire Lad</I> ... and the
poetry of the <I>Cantos</I> or <I>The Waste Land</I> seems so aberrant as
to verge on the pathological.&quot;</P>

<P>Yet it was typical. Inevitable in fact for those who couldn't distinguish
between &quot;the poetic revolution&quot; and a &quot;revolution in taste,&quot;
or who still thought of taste as an issue. Even an attempt at such distinctions
was then unlikely, for the careers of the inheritors were too often literary,
resting like the idea of literature itself on a fixed notion of poetry and
poem, which might be improved upon but never questioned <I>at the root</I>.
And behind it too there was a strange fear of &quot;freedom&quot; as that
had been articulated by earlier, truly radical (&quot;experimental&quot;)
moderns - whether as &quot;free verse&quot; or &quot;free love&quot; or
the abandonment of judgment as a bind on the intelligence or of taste as
a determinant of value. 4</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>So if the taste and judgment they still clung to (and which made them
critics &quot;inspired by the criticism of T.S. Eliot&quot;) demanded &quot;modern&quot;
as an article of twentieth-century fate, they retained it, but they pulled
back into traditional and institutional securities, &quot;picking up again
the meters&quot; (Schwartz) as a moral, even a political buttress against
their own mid-century despair. And this itself, qua ideology, was made a
part of a <I>modern</I> dilemma, which came to define their rapidly evaporating
modern-ism - not as a promise of a new consciousness but as a glorified
&quot;failure of nerve.&quot;</P>

<P>Against which a counterpoetics was quickly starting to develop - a push,
foremost, to find new beginnings (or to retrieve old ones) appropriate to
the time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>2 The work in all its fullness ...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The postwar when it came, then, came from all directions. In that coming
it faced both a modernism stuck dead in its tracks and a resurgence of much
of what that modernism <I>at its fullest </I>had set out to challenge. The
new turning in America - in full motion by the middle 1950s - was central
to our own perception but only a part (a large part but a part) of a much
greater global whole. The <I>war</I>, which William Carlos Williams called
&quot;the first and only thing in the world today,&quot; was of course the
great dividing line - and with it the <I>bomb</I> that put an end, he also
reminded us, to much that was past, while</P>

<P>By which he meant that the stakes were now raised and would remain raised
to the present millennium's end and the next millennium's beginning. It
was from here - <I>everywhere </I>- that the new generations were to take
their start.</P>

<P>The nature of that start was not so much post<I>modern</I> - as it would
come to be called - as it was post-bomb and post-holocaust. Or it was postmodern
in the sense that Tristan Tzara had spoken of Dada three decades before,
naming a resistance that called both past and present into question, including
all those &quot;modern schools&quot; that still obeyed the rule of empire.
It was this rebellion and rejection, this &quot;great refusal&quot; at its
extreme, that marked all that was best in what was then beginning to take
shape. As such its extremes, which typified it as the stance of a new avant-garde,
represented a diverse development and/or a series of departures from what
had come before. Alongside the revival of the full range of modern [modernist]
moves, more notable expansions and divergences were taking place - from
critiques as correctives of an art mislabeled &quot;modern&quot; to more
far-reaching departures from Renaissance-derived modernities and the reclaiming
of [old] powers in the name of what Charles Olson early called &quot;<I>postmodern</I>
man.&quot; Rightly or wrongly named, the term and the issues raised thereby
(but never resolved or capable as such of resolution) came to define the
time and poetics in question.</P>

<P>The following, then, are some aspects of that time, which to a great
extent is still the time we live in.</P>

<P>There was a breakdown, first, of the more tyrannical aspects of the earlier
literary and art movements, and a turning away with that from totalizing/authoritarian
ideologies and individuals. Such a stance - &quot;against all <I>isms</I>,
against all that implied a system&quot; (C. Dotremont) - was in that sense
a matter of both life <I>and</I> art. 5</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
  <P>5 &quot;Art's obscured the difference between art and life. Now let
  life obscure the difference between life and art.&quot; (John Cage).<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>On its political and social sides, it was marked by a generally leftward
tilt - rarely the fascist and totalitarian temptations of many of the prewar
poets, though not entirely immune to a seductive - and repressive - totalitarianism
of the left from time to time. The result was the appearance by the 1960s
of a new &quot;dialectics of liberation,&quot; political and personal, marked
by a sense of resistance, of breaking free (in word and act, mind and body),
while retaining a more-than-formalist conception of the poem as vehicle-for-transformation.
Wrote Allen Ginsberg, drawing from an older source: &quot;When the mode
of the music changes, the walls of the city shake.&quot; And the Japanese
&quot;postwar poets&quot; (in a &quot;demand&quot; voiced by Ooka Makoto):
&quot;Bring back totality through poetry.&quot;6</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
  <P>6 And from another direction the Nigerian poet/novelist Chinua Achebe:
  &quot;New forms must stand ready to be called into being as often as new
  (threatening) forces appear on the scene. It is like 'earthing' an electrical
  charge to ensure communal safety.&quot;<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The &quot;liberation&quot; saw a resurgence, along with more stabilized
forms of poem-making, of old and new varieties of <I>free</I> verse and
<I>freed</I> words (&quot;concrete,&quot; &quot;projective,&quot; &quot;open,&quot;
&quot;variable,&quot; and so on). Along with this came the assertion - and
practice - of other freedoms in the poem and, by implication <I>and</I>
assertion, in the world beyond.7</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
  <P>7 &quot;Today freedom is more in need of inventors than defenders.&quot;
  (Andr&eacute; Breton)</P>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thus the poem was again and decisively opened to the full range of the
demotic (spoken) language, but with the freedom also to move between demotic
and hieratic (= &quot;literary&quot;) modes, or into other areas of discourse
long out of bounds for poetry. For a number of the poets in these pages
this meant an opening to popular modes and voices - a breakdown of distinctions
that both prefigured the &quot;pop art&quot; soon to come and later merged
with it. At a deeper or older (&quot;folk&quot;) level this was matched
by the appearance of submerged languages (dialects and idiolects) as new/old
vehicles for poetry: the Viennese of H.C. Artmann and others, the Friulian
of Pier Paolo Pasolini, the Jamaican &quot;nation language&quot; in oral
works by Michael Smith or Miss Queenie (and the written variations by Kamau
Brathwaite), the appropriations of &quot;black speech&quot; in the work
of African-American writers (and others) too numerous to mention, the pidgin
writings of Pacific poets in a range of <I>topoi</I> from New Guinea to
Hawaii. <I>And so on.</I> Wrote the American poet John Ashbery of his own
very real and very different aspirations in that direction: &quot;My idea
is to democratize all forms of expression ... the idea that both the most
demotic and the most elegant forms of expression deserve equally to be taken
into account.&quot;</P>

<P>This, then, is fulflillment. It is a wedge, among many, by which <I>all</I>
words will enter into presence - as in Whitman's prophecy (circa 1860) of
a total poetry that would (like &quot;the Real Dictionary&quot; he also
envisioned) incorporate &quot;all words that exist in use, the bad words
as well as any. ... [Like language itself] an enormous treasure-house, or
range of treasure-houses ... full of ease, definiteness and power - full
of sustenance.&quot; In such a poetry, with its open and unlimited vocabulary,
all subjects/themes were also possible - from the most demeaned to the most
exalted, from the most commonplace to the most learned, from myth to history
and back, from present into past and future.8</P>

  <P>8 &quot;The gift is that you are forced to put much more of the world

  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>While the first round of breakthroughs had occurred in the earlier twentieth
century, the realizations and divagations now were coming helter skelter
- and with them a persistent questioning (experimental and [soon to be]
&quot;post&quot;modern) of language's relation to any experience whatever,
to any reality, even that of language itself.9</P>

  <P>9 Again Adonis: &quot;The poem will be transgression. And yet, like
  the head of Orpheus, the poem will navigate on the river Universe, completely

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The results are contradictory and often <I>self</I>-contradictory, yet
one senses behind them a commonness of purpose: to throw down <I>and</I>
restore. And with this comes a necessary reassertion of the role of the
poet as seer and chronicler. The former guise, which an earlier neo-classic
tilt had covered over, was the image that vibrated through the Beat poetics
(and much else) from the mid-1950s on, and in its assertion across the globe
included an exploration of different forms of post-surrealist writing and
an alliance for some with previously suppressed religious and cultural forms:
shamanism, tantrism, sufism, kabbala, peyotism, etc. It also saw the reappearance
of what Allen Ginsberg spoke of as a <I>heroic</I> poetics: a renewed willingness
to thrust the poet forward as a heroic, even sacrificial figure in defense
of self and tribe, of human and mammal life (M. McClure) and with that,
of poetry itself.10</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
  <P>10 &quot;If anybody wants a statement of values it is this, that I am

  1961)<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(The moments of public breakthrough for Ginsberg and others were notable
in early resistance to the Vietnam War, in <I>samizdat</I> and underground
publication in the crumbling Soviet orb, and in the many independence movements
of the post-colonial &quot;third world.&quot;) In more literary terms, the
second half of the twentieth century was marked by the reassertion, in the
persistent (and false) divide between classicism and romanticism, of the
romantic impulse with a spiritual and material force that dominated the
early postwar period and has remained a presence thereafter.</P>

<P>While what was at issue here was a poetry of displacements and dreamings,
it was accompanied (sometimes in the same work) by a new &quot;object-ism&quot;:
an imagism of the familiar (&quot;here-and-now&quot;) and an unprecedented
<I>poetry of fact</I>. In the formulation by the Nicaraguan poet Ernesto
Cardenal, the call was for a new &quot;<I>exteriorismo</I> ... [an] objective
poetry ... made with elements of real life and concrete things, with proper
names and precise details and exact data, statistics, facts, and quotations.&quot;
Behind it was a half-century of explorations, from those that focused on
&quot;minute particulars&quot; (the poems of Francis Ponge and Marianne
Moore are eminent examples) to variations on Ezra Pound's recasting of the
epic (&quot;long poem&quot;) as &quot;a poem including history.&quot; That
definition or something close to it prefigured &quot;maximal&quot; works
by poets like William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky, Melvin Tolson, Muriel
Rukeyser, Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, Theodore Enslin, Robert Kelly, and
Anne Waldman in the United States, and elsewhere by poets like Pablo Neruda,
Vladimir Holan, Anna Akhmatova, Ernesto Cardenal, Hugh MacDiarmid, and Ren&eacute;
Depestre. With an eye toward the contemporary political implications of
&quot;history,&quot; the push was later extended by Ed Sanders to an &quot;investigative
poetry&quot; in which &quot;lines of lyric beauty descend from ... data
clusters [:] ... a form of historical writing ... using <I>every</I> bardic
skill and meter and method of the last 5 or 6 generations, in order to describe
every aspect (no more secret governments!) of the historical present.&quot;11</P>

<P>Such an effort, as (re)visioning, was tied as well to the reinvestigation
and reconfiguration of the entire <I>poetic</I> past and present a major
subtext, surely, of the present volumes. In a &quot;post-colonial&quot;
world it became one way again among many for poets to come forward as voices
for &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;tribe&quot; or &quot;community&quot; (as
elsewhere for &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;world&quot;), or to explore,
increasingly, the specifics of ethnicity and gender as they entered into
thought and word.12</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Here, as elsewhere in the art of the postwar, the work laid claim to
a renewed permission and validity, both as &quot;investigative poetry&quot;
(above) and as a vehicle for <I>direct</I> political resistance a contrast
thereby to the outright dismissal of such political poetry by &quot;new
critics&quot; and &quot;high&quot; modernists on the one hand and by Surrealists
in the mode of Breton on the other. Concurrently, and contrastively as well,
there was a renewed sense of history as <I>personal</I> history: the inner
life, including the deepest areas of sexuality and hitherto covert desires,
(again) laid bare.13</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>13 Note, for example, the important assertion within
  a new feminist poetry &amp; art (circa 1970) that the &quot;personal&quot;
  is in fact the &quot;political.&quot;<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In this the resultant work went far beyond the psychological limits and
distress of the (so-called) &quot;confessional&quot; poets of the 1960s,
edging toward what Clayton Eshleman, with the likes of Antonin Artaud among
the forerunners, spoke of as the &quot;construction of the underworld&quot;
and traced back, as a form of &quot;grotesque realism,&quot; to its (painted)
sources in the cave art of the late Paleolithic.</P>

<P>Here is a tension, then, between extremes of the personal and communal
the &quot;unspeakable visions of the individual&quot; (J. Kerouac) and the
reconstructed &quot;tale of the tribe&quot; (E.Pound). (It is from a number
of such &quot;tensions&quot; or &quot;oppositions&quot; that our work as
a whole has been constructed.) In the working out of those extremes, both
formal and historical explorations came up against what Alfredo Guiliani,
writing for the Italian Novissimi, demanded as &quot;a genuine 'reduction
of the I' as producer of meaning,&quot; or what Olson, in a famous act of
condemnation (more exactly, of realignment and questioning), called &quot;the
getting rid of the lyrical interference of the individual as ego.&quot;
But alongside the continuing &quot;inwardness&quot; of Olson's developing
poetics (= &quot;projective verse&quot;)14, there were other attempts at
still more objective, non-&quot;expressionistic&quot; methods of composition.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>14 &quot;... But if he stays inside himself, if he is

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These included not only experiments with systematic (objective) chance
operations a tension (post-Dada) between &quot;chance&quot; and &quot;choice,&quot;
as notable in the works, e.g., of Jackson Mac Low and John Cage but a concern
with other procedural, even mechanical (machine-derived) methods that seemed,
momentarily at least, to put the will in suspension, to allow the poem &quot;to
write itself,&quot; and by so doing, to invite still more of the world to
enter the poem.15</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>15 &quot;All of these are ways to let in forces other
  than yourself ... possibilities that one's habitual associations what we

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There is in this approach in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere
something like Wittegenstein's sense of philosophy as &quot;as a struggle
with the fascination that forms of expression have upon us.&quot; (Both
the poignancy and force of such a dictum, when transferred to poetry, are
here worth noting.)</P>

<P>This interrogation of language, or of the language-reality nexus as such,
was from the late 1940s (and continuing, increasingly, into the present)
the second great arena for what came to be called the &quot;postmodern.&quot;
Here the experiencing <I>self</I>, while never disappearing, was superceded
by processes of language and by the appropriation and redirection of texts
and utterances already present in the language. The outcome was a number
of versions of what the Cobra poets, say, or the European &quot;situationists&quot;
spoke of as a <I>d&eacute;tournement</I> not merely a &quot;diversion&quot;
or &quot;deflection&quot; of an inherited text but, as stated elsewhere
by Ken Knabb, &quot;a turning aside from the normal course or purpose (often
with an illicit connotation).&quot; Such a turning, twist, or &quot;torque&quot;
(G. Quasha) was deeply sourced in earlier workings with collage and in the
language-centered experiments of predecessors like Gertrude Stein, Velimir
Khlebnikov, and Kurt Schwitters, among others. But what had been the scattered,
sometimes casual breakthroughs of that earlier time now took new directions
and became the central work of poets in many different places. Such foregroundings
of language had also influenced a number of key figures in areas like philosophy
or ethnology, and these in turn would come to influence or interact with
the postwar generations of poets, particularly in the reconceptualization
of poetry as a function of language and, inversely, language as a function
of <I>poesis</I>.</P>

<P>At work here was a renewed focus on language's role in shaping the perception
of reality, with the poets' experimental work vindicated and enriched, for
example, by linguistic investigations like those of Benjamin Lee Whorf on
the nature of non-Indoeuropean languages such as Hopi and Maya.16</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>16 &quot;We are thus introduced to a new principle of
  relativity which holds that all observers are not led by the same physical
  evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds
  are similar or can in some way be calibrated.&quot; (Benjamin Lee Whorf)</P>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Similarly, many of the old questions on &quot;the nature of representation&quot;
received new formulations and thought, both in the practice of the poets
( articulated as <I>poetics</I> by, e.g., the Italian Neo-avanguardia, the
U.S.-centered Language Poets, and, maybe primarily, the French <I>Tel Quel
</I>group) and in the developing &quot;science&quot; of semiotics (from
Ferdinand de Saussure early in the twentieth century to various post-structuralisms
in the [almost] present). If such metapoetic concerns could open a window
on alternative language possibilities, they also pointed to the trap inherent
in a language-dominated universe a trap of language through which the poet
would have to break, Artaud had warned us, &quot;in order to touch life.&quot;17</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Given the allure and danger of that situation , the response was either
to investigate the laws and limits (= rules) of language or to break those
rules deliberately; to devise new ways of &quot;making language&quot; (thereby
making or denying meaning) or to play variations on language as discovered
in a range of cultural/linguistic contexts.</P>

<P>Related to all that and a point of reference, often, in poet-directed
discussions of poetics was the sense that the poet, like all humans, is
a vehicle through or by which language speaks. Outside the immediate poetry
nexus, the point revealed itself in Heidegger's insistence, say, that it
is language that thinks, rather than man; in Wittgenstein's related meditations
(&quot;the limits of my language mean the limits of my world&quot;); or
in Lacan's formulation that &quot;the unconscious is structured like  language.&quot;
While such views triggered active responses from poets, they were less a
revelation than a confirmation of what had long been known that language
has always been both familiar <I>and</I> uncanny, and that there is a point
at which one can say with Rimbaud, e.g.: &quot;I do not think but I am thought.&quot;
What was news for critics and theorists, then, was a familiar realization
(and practice) for poets, those in particular who were conversant with shamanic
and other forms of mediumship, with western/romantic ideas of inspiration
and numinosity, with zeitgeists and collective unconsciouses. In its more
extreme formulations (early Roland Barthes, say, and the later post-everything
critical establishment, especially in U.S. academia), the autonomy of language
devolved into the canard of &quot;the death of the author.&quot;18</P>

<P>Yet news of the latter's death has been much exaggerated: the authors

<P>As in the earlier half of the century, this work was marked by a number
of emphases that both denied the possibility of closure and at the same
time moved, however fitfully, toward fulfillment. These emphases, tentatively
presented in the first of our two volumes, can be emended for inclusion
here:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>an exploration of new forms of language, consciousness, and social/biological
  relation-ships, both by deliberate experimentation in the present and by
  reinterpretation of the entire human past;
  <LI>poetry-art intersections in which conventional boundaries between arts
  break down,sometimes involving generalized art movements (Cobra, Fluxus)
  often led by poets and with a poetics at their center;
  <LI>experiments with dream work and altered forms of consciousness (from
  the continuation of Surrealist dream experiments to the psychedelic experiments
  of the 1960s, the meditative experiments of the 1970s, and beyond) in which
  language itself becomes an instrument of vision;
  <LI>a return to the concept of poetry as a performance genre: a spin-off
  both from earlier modernist sources (Futurism, Dada) and from still viable
  oral traditions, and ranging from avant-garde theater and soundtext works
  to the readings, &quot;slams&quot; and musical improvisations (jazz, rock,
  and other) of a new &quot;performance poetry;&quot;
  <LI>language experiments, including the soundtext works mentioned above,
  as well as experiments with visual and typographical forms, book works,
  attempts to develop a nonsyntactic and nonreferential poetry;
  <LI>a renewed privileging of demotic and/or ordinary language, along with
  a turn on the one hand toward prose as an instrument of poetry and on the
  other toward the exploration of previously suppressed languages (including
  the genuine languages of the deaf, not shown here) or of those sublanguages
  (dialects, idiolects, creoles, pidgins, etc.) that had long been at the
  fringes of accepted literature;
  <LI>in the American instance, an early push for a &quot;new measure&quot;
  as a tightening and strengthening of the century-long and nearly global
  commitment to free verse, and a related if contrary view (both here and
  elsewhere) of the poem as raw, unfinished, and ineluctably in process;
  <LI>ethnopoetics and similar reassessments of the past and of alternative
  poetries in the present: a broadening of cultural terrains, directed by
  the sense of an ancient and often surviving subterranean tradition with
  the poetic impulse at its center;
  <LI>a widespread attack on the dominance in art and life of European &quot;high&quot;
  culture, leading in the last decades of the twentieth century to a proliferation
  of movements stressing exploration and expansion of ethnic and gender as
  well as class identities;
  <LI>a concurrent if contradictory move toward a new globalism, even nomadism
  an intercultural poetics that could break across the very boundaries and
  definitions of self and nation that were a latent source of its creative
  powers;
  <LI>an ongoing if shifting connection to related political and social movements,
  with an increasing emphasis on an openness and freedom of expression and
  a gradual veering away from what had become, heroically but often disastrously,
  an age of ideologies;
  <LI>a widely held belief that poetry is part of a struggle to save the
  wild places in the world and in the mind and a view of the poem itself
  as a wild thing and of both poetry and poet as endangered species;
  <LI>a sense of excitement and play (&quot;to work in the excitedness of
  pure being ... to get back that intensity into the language&quot; G. Stein)
  that must be brought across to show the work of the age in all its color
  and as the poetry &quot;that might be fantastic life&quot; (R.Duncan).
</UL>

<P>With all of this the time has been remarkable too for the unprecedented
degree of participation by poets in the formulation individual by individual
or group by group of a large array of speculative poetics: writings that
assert autonomy and connect the work and life of each poet to the larger
human fate. That there is an absence of unanimity in these writings is a
point that we would like to stress, although our attempts at synthesis may
sometimes give the opposite impression. There is also no question but that
we are ourselves participants, not just observers, and that our participation
colors all we've done here. It would be foolish then even more so than with
our first volume to view what follows as an attempt to set up a new canon
of contemporaries. Rather, as before, we would have the anthology serve
a more useful function, as a mapping of the possibilities some among many
that have continued to open up for us here and now, at the century's turning.</P>

<P>It is the richness of those openings that may define this time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>3 The work from all directions ...</H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>That the early &quot;postwar&quot; corresponded with the great American
moment (the &quot;American century&quot;) is quite clear. Its impact on
our poetry as such appeared most convincingly in <I>The New American Poetry,</I>
edited by Donald Allen in 1960: a summary of experimental work over the
previous decade and a half and the most public challenge till then to the
entrenched middle-ground poetry and poetics of the 1950s. Concerning the
poets gathered therein, Allen wrote: &quot;They are our avant-garde, the
true continuers of the modern movement in American poetry. Through their
work many are closely allied to modern jazz and abstract expressionist painting,
today recognized throughout the world to be America's greatest achievements
in contemporary culture. This anthology makes the same claim for the new
American poetry, now becoming the dominant movement in the second phase
of our twentieth-century literature and already exerting strong influence
abroad.&quot; Yet what was less apparent for many of those participating
in or being drawn to it was that what was happening in American poetry was
part of a larger <I>global</I> awakening, some of it occuring before or
apart from the American influence as such and some of it in collaboration
with or influencing other young Americans in turn. (That other avant-gardes
were active in the United States should also be considered.)</P>

<P>We are saying this, of course, with something over forty years of hindsight.
What was then revealing itself from outside the United States was from an
earlier generation that poets in America were (and, to some extent, still
are) in the process of (re)discovering. Just as word was coming back about
the older American &quot;Objectivists&quot; (themselves becoming visible
again as makers of a transitional &quot;new American poetry&quot;), the
poets recovered from elsewhere included the likes of Neruda and Vallejo
(poet-heroes of the other &quot;America&quot;), of Surrealist masters like
Breton and Artaud (disregarded by the American middle-grounders in favor
of less &quot;convulsive&quot; practitioners like Eluard and Desnos), of
Dadaists like Tzara and Ball or like Kurt Schwitters, whose work was hinted
at but only hinted at in Robert Motherwell's great <I>Dada Artists and Poets
</I>(1951), another generative, albeit historical, anthology appearing in
the postwar time. And there were glimmerings too of an older but still obscure
generation of Negritude poets in Africa and the Caribbean a whole world,
in fact, to reassemble.</P>

<P>What was known then, much of it obscured by the anti-modernist turn at
the beginning of the decade, was imperative to know. What was not known
- obscured here by a heady breakthrough as <I>American</I> poets [pre-Viet
Nam] - was how much else was coming into presence then or had emerged, even
in this most American of centuries and moments, without our blessings. Over
the last few years the two editors have had a chance to go over the terrain
of the immediate postwar decades (1945 to 1960, the years of the New American
Poetry per se) and to carry that exploration into the still less charted
places that define the boundaries of the present gathering. This has been
fired in some sense by our own nomadism20 and our sense of a community /
a commonality of poets that both of us have known (and continue to know)
across whatever boundaries.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>20 &quot;A nomadic poetics will cross languages, not
  just translate, but write in all or any of them. If Pound, Joyce, &amp;
  others have shown the way, it is essential now to push this matter further,
  again, not as 'collage' but as a material flux of language matter, moving
  in &amp; out of semantic &amp; non-semantic spaces, moving around &amp;
  through the features accreting as a poem, a lingo-cubism that is no longer
  an 'explosant fixe,' as Breton defined the poem, but an 'explosante mouvante.'&quot;
  (P.J.)<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Being far enough away from inception now to have a wider view of that
terrain, we see the &quot;new American poetry&quot; as itself a part (a
key part, sure, but still a part) of a worldwide series of moves and movements
that took the political, visionary, and formal remnants of an earlier modernism
and reshaped and reinvented them in the only time allowed to us on earth.</P>

<P>What we would like to give our readers, then who will no doubt be American
in the main is a sense of the configuration, the reconfiguration we've attempted
- both to see how the sweep of a U.S. &quot;postmodernism&quot; fits into
that larger frame and how much richer the work from then down to the present
is when considered in something like its wholeness. In our first volume
we tried a similar approach, covering a range of work &quot;from fin-de-si&egrave;cle
to negritude&quot; - from Mallarm&eacute;'s <I>Coup de d&egrave;s</I> of
1897 to work appearing in the midst of World War II. The division there
was into three &quot;galleries&quot; of individual poets and six sections
devoted to the movements that typified the time but have been deliberately
omitted or reduced to footnotes in most other gatherings of poetry. (These
were, in order, Futurism [both Russian and Italian], Expressionism, Dada,
Surrealism, the &quot;Objectivists,&quot; and Negritude.) In doing this
we were not being original (or even &quot;ornery&quot; in some sense) but
asserting what for many of us was the actual configuration of that time.
We were also setting the stage for the second volume - approaching the present
world in which we live and work.</P>

<P>With the second volume - from World War II to the (almost) present- there
is no completion and the omissions and gaps are unavoidable. Having said
that, it is our hope that the book will give a view of poetry &quot;from
all directions&quot; and will allow a reading of U.S. poetry and poets juxtaposed
with sometimes equally experimental, sometimes more experimental poetry
from elsewhere. (For this reason, with America as the point of departure,
the amount of American poetry is and remains disproportionate.) Over all,
the question of inclusion and exclusion, which can never be properly resolved,
was less important with regard to individuals and movements - more with
regard to the possibilities of poetry now being opened.21</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>21 Where a choice was to be made, however, we put ourselves
  deliberately on the side of what we took to be the &quot;experimental&quot;
  and &quot;disruptive&quot; in U.S. terms the &quot;new American poetry&quot;
  (particularly the emphases on &quot;measure&quot; and &quot;history&quot;)
  and its later offshoots and extensions, alongside the Fluxus tradition
  (below) of &quot;erasing the boundaries between art and life,&quot; between
  genres and divergent art forms, etc. Even so there is no way of accounting
  for all poets of interest during this time.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are two galleries this time around, the first and earlier consisting
largely of poets who were or became active during the 1940s and 1950s, the
second of those who became active in the 1960s, 1970s and (but here our
offerings become more minimal) in the 1980s and 1990s. And within these
galleries we've embedded a number of groupings somewhat like the movements
of the previous volume, but often more localized or more restricted (with
several notable exceptions) to moves in poetry rather than across the arts,
although that poetry may itself show real amalgams with the plastic arts
or music. The point, anyway, is not to trace influences from group to group
but to set out a range of responses to the postwar (cold war) era and to
the time and the places in which the poets lived.</P>

<P>The first gallery, then, consists of work from some fifty poets - from
Marie Luise Kaschnitz, born in 1901, to Gary Snyder, born in 1930. It follows
a small opening section (&quot;Prelude&quot;), which announces our point
of departure among the disasters of war and fascism counterpointed by a
section of poems by some of the poets who appeared in the earlier volume
but whose postwar poetry - often &quot;maximal&quot; as Olson would have
had it showed a meaningful continuity between the century's two halves.
But it's in the contents of the first gallery as such that the richness
of the time begins to assert itself - a richness measured in fact by its
unboundedness. It is a configuration of contemporaries - already ours -
and of possibilities - ours also - with regard to which the vaunted American
dominance (forty years later) seems a clear exaggeration That we may feel
a kinship (and sometimes open friendship) with <I>all</I> those present
here and elsewhere in the book is a further point worth making.</P>

<P>The second gallery continues in the same way, taking as examples work
from close to sixty poets, from the Congolese Tchicaya U'Tamsi, born in
1931, to the American-Korean Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, born in 1951. If there
are breaks between the two galleries, there are also mergers and collaborations,
and along with these a growing ease with the means inherited from earlier
generations as well as a sense of the problematic and contentious as necessary
charactersitics of poetry in a time of experiment and change. Our own moves
here are much more tentative, much more open to question (our own self-questionings
included), than in our first volume, for we are speaking now from within
the field at a point, that is, where participation colors observation, and
distance, if at all desired, is near impossible to come by. We have therefore
let the poets speak, as much as possible, on their own behalfs, peppering
our commentaries with a variety of poets' self-accountings, in the belief
that each citation can in some sense enter as a &quot;special view&quot;
of poetry and of the world and mind-set from which that poetry emerges.
In a similar vein, we have compiled a section of poems and extracts, occupying
the center of our book, in which poets of the latter half of the century
continue to exercise and develop the &quot;art of the manifesto&quot; that
has been a crucial mark of avant-garde production &quot;from then to now.&quot;
And we conclude the volume with a group of postludes two poems of our own
and one by Robert Duncan, which he wrote, still with hope, at the time of
his final illness.</P>

<P>Along with the individual poets presented in our &quot;galleries&quot;
- and there are, clearly, many more of consequence - groupings began to
appear and common themes and practices began to be visible: mini-movements
with some resemblance to the larger movements of the pre-war time. Some
were confined to a single place and language or to a narrow set of places,
others to a sweep that cut more boldly than their predecesors across divides
of place and nation. Six of the ones we've chosen and inserted in our galleries
were already active in the 1950s, two of those as far back as the later
1940s, while three were creatures mainly of the seventies and eighties.
The remaining two inserted sections, &quot;oral poetries&quot; and &quot;cyberpoetics&quot;
(as indications of a possible past and possible future of poetry) are more
like curatorial groupings constructions by the editors, intended to foreground
certain widespread but largely unformulated currents. The thrust in almost
all was toward a rupture with the past, or a renewal of the interrupted
ruptures of the pre-war avant-gardes, now made more urgent by the wars and
cold wars of the time and by a sense of dangers and repressions still persisting.</P>

<P>As with our individual selections, we are aware of many of the other
groupings that could have been included in a work like ours from the German
&quot;Gruppe '47&quot; to the poets around the French <I>Tel Quel </I>or
<I>Change</I> &quot;collectives,&quot; from key U.S. movements like the
Black Mountain poets of the 1950s or the Umbra (African-American) poets
of the 1960s to still active configurations such as the British Poetry Revival
initiated in the 1970s or the Argentinian &quot;Xul&quot; group of the 1980s
and '90s. (Individual poets connected with some of these groupings do in
fact show up in the gallery sections.) Our mapping is thus more an indication
of the ongoing importance of community and collaboration than some final
or exhaustive taxonomy of movements. This is borne out, as a primary example,
by the absence in the book of a section devoted specifically to such a pivotal
and genuinely international movement as &quot;Fluxus,&quot; despite the
fact that we have long taken it as one of the groupings of artists &amp;
poets truly originary for the period. (We had thought at one point of using
the word &quot;fluxus&quot; in the subtitling of our second volume.) Still,
almost all of the group's central poets are presented somewhere in these
pages, since in the view of the editors the Fluxus stance, with its emphasis
on the merging of art and life, on intermedia, and on an ironic relation
to the products of consumer culture, can be seen as the &quot;invisible
college&quot; pervading much (in some sense <I>most</I>) of this era's central
work. With its opening to the whole range of previously &quot;experimental&quot;
methods chance operations, textsound, concrete poetry, &amp; so on it both
challenged the academicized &quot;modernism&quot; of its time and incorporated
most of the practices connected with the most formally disruptive side of
avant-garde poetry and art. That Fluxus has been literally obliterated from
other histories of poetry is yet another point worth making.</P>

<P>Our intention as editors has been to act against such obliterations,
not toward a new narrowing of poetry but toward its further opening. In
that light we have felt ourselves driven by a sense that the near past of
poetry has never been adequately presented that a truer presentation has
long been needed, both to reaffirm the work of the present and to lay (again)
the groundwork for the future. Acceptance or rejection could then follow,
but it would no longer be a judgment based on ignorance or on a deliberate
ignoring or misreading of what had already happened. As with our first volumewe
have tried to avoid a doctrinaire avant-gardism while presenting works that
test the limits of poetry, but we recognize that this has eliminated a number
of writers whose achievements in their own terms we have not intended to
put into question. Still others do not appear because of the limits of translation
or because our book, while large, is once again bounded, as all our works
and lives are bounded. We think therefore that offerings beyond our own
are needed, and we welcome not only those that agree with ours but those
that bring forward other and different &quot;special views&quot; other assessments
and approaches to an art that we still think of as central to our aspirations
as thinking, feeling human beings.</P>

<P>It is our hope that what we have done here will have some resonance in
the century and millennium now emerging. Looking backward at the same time
we are aware of the distance even now between ourselves and most of the
century in which we're writing: a time of two great avant-garde awakenings,
when much seemed possible and poetry held out a still untested promise as
an instrument of transformation, even of redemption. We are at the moment
in a possibly less threatening but curiously less hopeful state, caught
between a rapidly developing technology and a resurgent economic conservatism
threatening to become a cultural and social conservatism as well. In that
sense the core conflicts are very much like those at the old century's beginning.
And yet with all of that the idea of millennium still draws us on, allures
us again with the hope of a poetics pointed firmly toward the future. We
began our assemblage with Whitman's words &quot;for poets to come&quot;:</P>
