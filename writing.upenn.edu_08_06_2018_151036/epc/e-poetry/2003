      <p>It is our pleasure to announce E-Poetry 2003: An International Digital 
        Poetry Festival, the second event in the acclaimed E-Poetry series inaugurated 
        in Buffalo in April 2001. E-Poetry is a series, directed by Loss Peque&ntilde;o 
        Glazier from the University at Buffalo, which provides an artist and practitioner-oriented 
        series of events in the spirit of some of the early poetry festivals, 
        such as the Vancouver Poetry Festival, 1963, and the Berkeley Poetry Conference, 
        1965, each altering the course of poetry. The series allows artists the 
        opportunity to engage the state of their art and to advance its possibilities 
        through dialog, performance, and peer interaction. </p>
      <p>We are doubly pleased to announce the host institution for this year's 
        event, West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. In collaboration with 
        E-Poetry 2003's co-director, Sandy Baldwin, we are planning a rich and 
        varied three and a half days of digital poetry, conversation, and artist-oriented 
        scholarship, in the inviting setting of West Virginia. E-Poetry 2003 extends 
        the frontiers opened with E-Poetry 2001, adding numerous new voices and 
        engaging new visions to the festival.</p>
      <p>This year's focus is on the &quot;poetry&quot; in &quot;E-Poetry&quot;.</p>
      <p>Please mark your calendars and plan to attend this event! Morgantown 
        is 5 hours from Buffalo, 1 hour from Pittsburgh, 3 hours from Washington 
        DC, and 5 hours from New York City. We recommend you find the best airfare 
        available to Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>Inquiries and proposals may be sent to the organizers at the e-mail addresses 
        below. All participants MUST <a href="http://www.clc.wvu.edu/epoetry/registration.html">register</a> 
        to attend E-Poetry 2003 by April 1, 2003.</p>
      <p>Plan to join us in Morgantown to celebrate this next articulation of 
        the potentials of E-Poetry!</p>
