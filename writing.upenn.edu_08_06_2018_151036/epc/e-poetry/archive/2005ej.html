      <p>Wasn't 'No Direction Home' great? (and yesterday I finally bought Chronicles, 
        2 quid off at Waterstone's, fascinating as writing and (more surprisingly) 
        as plausible memoir). The rest of this week is another epoch: EPOETRY 
        2005 LONDON. [Information can be found at <a href="../2005">http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/e-poetry/2005/</a>.]</p>
      <p>Just back from the first night, presentations by John Cayley, Loss Peque&ntilde;o 
        Glazier and the prodigious Talan Memmott (of whom one project contains 
        matter enough for several different careers); high calibre stuff. It's 
        not *all sitting in the dark staring at blinking screens -- Loss's piece 
        included live dancing, and further presentations will likewise be exploring 
        the edgy interface between virtual and real performance elements, notably 
        I imagine London Under Construction on Saturday morning. The next few 
        days anyway see a mixture of work showings and papers, interspersed with 
        discussion; lots of people have travelled to England from America and 
        Europe for this because the work and the talk in the air, noise and weather 
        of London will be different from how they are in other climates and landscapes, 
        on and offline ... For those based 'here' who practise or are critically 
        engaged with advanced poetry / poetics, and/or digital writing, it is 
        a concentrated chance to move thinking on (free of 56K &amp; the phone 
        bill) ... If you don't come, you won't be able to remember it.</p>

      Subject: the everyday at epoetry 2005 
      <p>'I go searching': every day for a month Kirsten Lavers (who is 'really' 
        a visual artist (UK)) typed a variant of this phrase into Google, and 
        worked with the text on the first page of results, in the animation program 
        Flash, selecting, rearranging and visually reformatting it. Now, the reader 
        will be served a different one of the resulting pieces, keyed to the date 
        on their own web browser (This work is published in the online journal 
        How2). Christophe Bruno (France? see iterature.com) uses Google results 
        summaries too, especially the elliptical (&amp; often misleading) extracts 
        from the pages found. Bruno has also devised a piece which in response 
        to a search, compiles a kind of ur blog using existing blog texts. S&oslash;ren 
        Pold (Denmark) showed this (and his terrific paper embedded these practices 
        right in the history of the book). Alan Sondheim (US) issues text bulletins 
        daily to listservs and other locations: Maria Damon' related these often 
        peculiarly intense and discomfiting missives to the genre of begging letters, 
        and to the urgency and desperation manifested in some of Walter Bejamin's 
        writings. Is this possibly the most significant single online poetry practice, 
        (and/) or is it spam? A question older than the web ... A young team of 
        writers and computer scientists from Rhode Island and Chicago is developing 
        new tools to harvest material from the internet according to semantic 
        relationships with an intentionally written text, which then incorporates 
        and is altered by it. The aim of the project (the Error Engine) is for 
        a truly relevant literature that co-exists and is imbued with the 'flimsy 
        but largely successful construction of reality' in the news; but the radical 
        poetics was in the claims made for the actual technology, which apparently 
        uses a species of 'evolutionary computation' in a configuration inherently 
        open, thus there will never be any one 'solution' to the task it performs 
        'only the best possible adaptation to current circumstances'. A potent 
        new metaphor! (But woah, if you are taking stuff from other people's pages 
        and re-using it, do you have an ethical obligation to give them something 
        back, and/or to cite them? Another old chestnut ... ) jUS!tin katKO (US) 
        walks, or runs, a video recorder around 'the readable city' (pace Robert 
        Venturi, quoted by S&oslash;ren Pold earlier), holding up or out a sig 
        or tag written on his own hand like a traffic cop goes STOP or a director 
        CUT. To us, the film shown is very fast and loud, with hectic music, and 
        then shown again with jUS!tin adding live performance of voice and eventually 
        body, leaping around in frontof the figures on the screen and throwing 
        himself repeatedly with cartoon force at the floor, THWACK! etc. He hurt 
        himself a little bit. Hugely exciting work from this young associate of 
        Keith Tuma, cris cheek and mIEKAL AND -- credit to them! (and that was 
        only one of the things he showed). This was on the evening bill, along 
        with Joerg Piringer's (Austria) 'spambot', which apparently took a page 
        of that often engaging linguistic spam randomly compiled alongside the 
        advert to evade mail filters, and turned it first into an airspace full 
        of words which then completely morphed it into a slick elegant dance of 
        abstract forms, this showing too accompanied by recorded and live voice-sound 
        (Piringer is into sound petry also). Elizabeth Knipe (US) was the third 
        performer and her quiet, intimate and rather beautiful films-with-poetry 
        ('bucolic' I thought about one, and 'lyric' another) don't fit into the 
        theme I've taken to cohere just a fraction of the day's contents around, 
        but whatever. I am now about to be late for the morning's proceedings, 
        which will be scarily theoretical, but come for tonight's fun part those 
        who can!! 8 p.m. at Birkbeck College, London: presentations of the Error 
        Engine (as above), Philippe Bootz (a long-established French e-poet) and 
        Brigid McLeer (UK out of Ireland). Yes, this is cross-posted, but I have 
        to tell.</p>

        Date: 01 October 2005 01:24<br>
        Subject: Bodies of theory at epoetry 2005</p>
      <p>As I walked in rather late, Philippe Bootz (France) was saying 'Everybody 
        can be a meta-reader, except during reading', and promising to show us 
        'the aesthetics of frustration', if there was time. Bootz's theorising 
        is stern stuff. The style of his work we saw later seemed different: quite 
        expansive, aesthetic, warm even; some was even comic, and part of his 
        own perfomance broke into non-verbal grunting. Gavin Stuart (UK) is the 
        new director of trAce, the remarkable online writing organization founded 
        by Sue Thomas (www.trace.ntu.ac.uk ), but he was talking about the applicability 
        of some of Bakhtin's ideas to digital, interactive writing. An idea like 
        'dialogism' can be completely baggy, but if you can keep it sharp I guess 
        it can be used generatively, which was Stuart's stated interest, and even 
        to critique and improve the work you do. Talan Memmott (US) does theory 
        as clowning, or vice versa. Bootz's 'Poetry Without Reading' he raised 
        with a 'Silent Lecture', a typically brilliant performance whose apparent 
        shambolic and chaotic style contradicted its precise planning (subject 
        to a noisy kitchen timer) and the seamless virtuosity of (what I've seen 
        of) Memmott's own creative work. Its introduction, typed live, remained 
        projected throughout onto a whiteboard, on which Memmott then wrote and 
        drew diagrams apparently referring to pages of notes on paper, ('mostly 
        crap'), which he tore in pieces and scattered. Boxes of board markers 
        were emptied onto the floor, so that he slithered over them, stumbling 
        also sometimes across the board's protruding supports. However what emerged, 
        albeit quickly occluded again, was sensible: witty and clever, and even 
        readable if you followed closely, at least as much so as a poem; though 
        I couldn't say whether a logical argument unfolded. Towards the end he 
        drew around his own shadow. In the discussion session following these 
        presentations, someone expressed surprise at the emphasis on the body 
        in performances throughout the conference, which occasioned a good deal 
        of response.</p>
      <p>Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier (US) talked about the textual body, its architecture, 
        in particular its apertures. The 'smallest details' can (should) create 
        meaning in text in whatever medium, but when these architectural aspects 
        are not set in stone but programmed to occur ad hoc, whether randomly 
        or systematically, the poetics is arguably much deepened: you don't see 
        everything at once. What, then constitutes 'the work'? etc. ... (There 
        was much more to Loss's paper than this.) Theory was implicit in Jean-Pierre 
        Balpe (France)'s presentation, of a dynamic work installed in public spaces 
        throughout a French town, on the LED billboards used by traffic authorities 
        etc. to communicate with the public. A phone line was used to receive 
        commands from the readers, who were able to influence the story that was 
        distributed across these separate sites. Skirting on public art here would 
        have been a good moment to widen the discussion into the political realm 
        -- a paper had been proposed by Keston Sutherland which looked likely 
        to suggest that interactive aesthetics deludes and diverts the impulse 
        to real activity (a doubtless very crude reading of the abstract seems 
        to suggest this); unfortunately he wasn't able to attend. Very little 
        (though not nothing) has been said about politics so far; underlying issues 
        of importance seem rather to be, how digital and networked writing may 
        contribute to poetics in general by raising awareness of the mediatedness, 
        unnoticed or denied, of all textual production, and what that could lead 
        to; and the need for a rhetorical taxonomy of e poetry or new media writing 
        generally.</p>
      <p>The evening began with a reception in the foyer bar of RADA (the drama 
        college), which was very pleasant but I mention it only because following 
        hard on our heels there was a Farrago slam poetry event, and when it was 
        made clear we should push off, with a performance poet starting a warm-up 
        set, someone negotiated for jUStin !katKO to have a spot. He proceeeded 
        to perform a sound reading, which he dedicated to Bob Cobbing, of the 
        floor of the room. It was terrific stuff -- for a minute I thought there 
        might be a fight, but to give them credit the Farrago crew applauded, 
        and then we all trooped back across the road to Birkbeck.</p>
      <p>Later our evening ended too with sound poetry: first Joerg Piringer improvised 
        an accelerated reading with live sampling, of a Flash action script manual 
        he'd just bought in nearby Waterstone's, and then Lawrence Upton (UK), 
        and justin k again, performed together a new visual text of Lawrence's, 
        hissing and growling and twitching around in front of some of justin's 
        video. Lovely! At the end, Lawrence was left standing in centre stage 
        with NO SIGNAL projected fortuitously across his mouth.</p>

        Date: 03 October 2005 02:03<br>
        Subject: The British at epoetry 2005</p>
      <p>An MA degree in Poetic Practice was set up two or three years ago at 
        Royal Holloway, University of London; it's directed by Redell Olsen and 
        uniquely in this country (I believe?) for a literature department -- as 
        opposed to visual arts -- combines poetry, and poetics, with study and 
        practice in a range of technologies. (We heard yesterday however that 
        something similar-sounding is starting up at De Montfort University, Leicester.) 
        The programme is becoming a centre of gravity for new media writing of 
        various kinds, and one of its graduates, John Sparrow, curated the showings 
        yesterday (the final day of the conf). His own work includes (to my eye) 
        highly accomplished Flash; juxtaposition of found imagery and text; and 
        use of text randomising; and most importantly the words are good ... I 
        enjoyed all the RHUL alumni work, albeit distracted by nerves about having 
        to chair the discussion following. Ceridwen Buckmaster's elegantly presented 
        piece combined composed text, emails (used with consent but anonymised) 
        and several live voices. Elizabeth-Jane Burnett's was audaciously unelectronic 
        but (I found) surprisingly affecting: she moved around the darkened room 
        distributing yellow roses and whispering to individuals, finally leaving 
        the room altogether. One audience member then read a message explaining 
        that she had gone to place a rose at a location selected on instruction 
        &gt;from another. A projected text invited everyone to propose locations 
        for the placement of roses during the next 12 days. Effective verbal performances 
        also accounted for much of the impact of Albert Pellicer's text, sound 
        and image pieces. The visual for one was a simple stereoscopic inscription, 
        'The Paper is Dreaming'; look out for the snapshots of us all wearing 
        those red-green glasses ... Birkbeck, another UL college, and Writers 
        Forum Workshop, are each partly responsible for bringing together the 
        loose grouping of poets and/or artists that is London Under Construction. 
        Here, Stephen Mooney in the flesh was joined by some or all of the other 
        6 members (from various real locations) in a chatroom, where we saw them 
        having a more or less consequential conversation while he read out transcripts 
        of emails previously exchanged among them ... 'Close to the Literal' was 
        a complex audio-visual collaboration by poet &amp; artist Lawrence Upton 
        (who also co-runs the WF workshop and the press) and composer John Drever. 
        Colour images, deriving from coastal landscapes and letter-forms, provided 
        a text/score for vocal performance: pre-recorded, live, and live-re-processed; 
        thus both participants contribute both prepared and improvised material. 
        The room was professionally wired (this takes hours) and the sound was 
        fantastic. Think Dylan &amp; Lanois (Oh Mercy).</p>
      <p>The piece was essentially episodic but a subtle architectonic seemed 
        discernible over its length. A substantial achievement.</p>
      <p>To risk generalisations, London work in general seems to be ungeeky, 
        informed by visual art practice, characteristically multi-media, live-performance 
        orientated, site-specific, and still excited to explore the now-quotidian 
        channels of electronic communication, often for collaboration. A real 
        aspiration towards (to quote from Ceri's piece) 'a materially based making 
        of the text into something of *use*' (my emphasis), and no easy belief 
        in that possibility -- someone in the LUC chat said: 'the immediacy of 
        these transactions renders them as good as useless.' They'll keep on struggling 
        with that, as they should; but I felt ever so proud of them! it feels 
        as though something is slowly but surely building up here.</p>
      <p>The day's other presentations were also of interest: Janis Jefferies, 
        Professor of Art and Director of the Digital Studios at Goldsmiths showed 
        documentation of a heavyweight collaborative project based in Montreal, 
        concerning electronics, text and textiles (blah blah -- but it *is worth 
        thinking about) e.g. 'smart' texts in garments and wall hangings, that 
        can respond to the environment and viewers. The novelist Kate Pullinger, 
        who moved into digital collaborations as a result of her association with 
        trAce, explained and demonstrated the application to multimedia narrative 
        of a new technology that enables reader interaction through breathing. 
        You do what, Walt? you strap a microphone under your nose ...? Clearly 
        this is to conjure with in relation to prosthetic theories of human-computer 
        interaction, and it doubtless has uses in disability etc., but I couldn't 
        see it catching on for everyday!</p>
      <p>The conference was great; it was great to have it in London; and great 
        to be able to hear and talk to Americans, French and Danish people, Germans, 
        Austrians and others who had travelled here especially for it (and not 
        all of them were even on the bill). It seems as though there is not exactly 
        a mass home interest, though new media work could arguably extend poetics 
        even for poets with no desire personally to leave page and stage. (Also 
        several native or resident Brits who are active in the area were unfortunately 
        unable to attend.) However, the conference was a definite success, tremendously 
        stimulating and a lot of fun, and will I am sure have further consequences, 
        for individuals who were there, and diffusing into the London poetry scene.</p>

        Subject: Re: But is epoetry a failure?</p>
      <p>I do think you have a point G, however I want to say, 1. not everything 
        in the conference ever purported to be epoetry -- smart textiles, fluxus-type 
        performance, sound poetry -- there undoubtedly was a conscious intent 
        to be exploring contexts, traditions and related activities; and 2. being 
        determined to do my reports pronto meant I did have to rush them, especially 
        the earlier days, so as j implied, it would be quite unfair if the whole 
        conference, let alone the whole field, were judged by them. It was for 
        instance much easier for me to run up a little narrative description of 
        what someone did on or off stage, than to transmit their complex ideas 
        or technical explanations, or to describe things that happened on a screen 
        that were not a movie of someone doing something. And a good deal of the 
        'business' was done in the generous-length open discussions following 
        each set of papers/showings too, which it's pretty hard to convey &amp; 
        I didn't try.</p>
      <p>Just a couple of the important things I omitted completely (as opposed 
        to those I just gave a ridiculously elliptical account of):</p>
      <p>Jim Rosenberg's 'Diagram poems' are constructed with a software he developed 
        some time ago I think, and they kind of have an old black &amp; white 
        classic look now; yet they're not like anything else you see, and nor, 
        I think, are they superseded, in any way. They present the reader both 
        occlusion and bird's-eye, you scan and delve and are not mystified or 
        immersed or unbalanced, but are required to make a reading otherwise there 
        isn't a poem (in a different sense from closing a book or clicking away 
        from a web page). Some idea can be got here: http://www.well.com/user/jer/ 
        Jim is totally 'e': in discussion he was always the one poking at the 
        gap between people's metaphors and their algorithms.</p>
      <p>If we're talking about getting re-enthused about old media just because 
        we've discovered some new ones... The person to address G's caveats actually 
        might be Sandy Baldwin, from the Center for Literary Computing at West 
        Virginia University, who gave a difficult theoretical paper on 'Digital 
        Poetics Before Aesthetics', contesting the positions of some other commentators, 
        in particular (according to my few helpless notes) the validation widely 
        claimed now in relation to 'materiality'. I think he proposes something 
        like, that digital poetics is or might be prior to the material; and that 
        the 'material' anyway is not some fundamental thing but institutionally 
        constituted, culture(d). Throughout the paper (making it even harder to 
        apply brain) the screen showed a virtual-reality piece made by Alan Sondheim 
        using (inter alia) &quot;creative mis-use and adaption of the motion capture 
        technologies at the Virtual Evironment Laboratory&quot; at WVU, in which 
        alien bodies emerged and fell and morphed in an uncomfortably sexual sort 
        of way; maybe not poetry except insofar as the work of a poet, but arguably 
        informed by, and a contribution to, poetics. This total presentation, 
        of ideas and work, was certainly at the 'hard' end of the conference's 
        spectrum.</p>
      <p>OK, that really will be all from me.</p>
