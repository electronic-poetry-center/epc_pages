1.)  Transpoesis.  This coinage has significant resonance for me, 
even as a nearly mono-lingual writer.  The pregnant quality 
of the figure--poetic making as the act of carrying over--informs 
the first, English-only, versions of Rif/t.  In name, Rif/t was 
meant to suggest the possibility of carrying poetry into a space 
from which it was notably, perhaps disturbingly, absent.  What 
constituted the rift, what barrier seemed to impede such a 
carrying over?
  
<p>

2.)  The flickering possibilities of the 'Riff' (without the stop) 
suggest, as Benjamin Friedlander <a href="../rift02/frie0201.html">later observed</a>, a cagey skirting 
of the problem (the question of origins, what lies to the left of 
the back-slash,) by suggesting a continuous version, re-version, and
repetition--a sidesteping of the question of beginnings by subsitution 
of the image of cyclic 'riffing' for 'origin'.  An equivocation, 
but perhaps a tactical one.

<p>

3.)  There is a rift within the lute that translation wants to
bridge, the impeding 'backslash' of language's specificities de la lengua
en particular the home and horror of a poetry that wants to bring some 
WHAT to some WHOM.  For many outside of poetry (those not receptive to it,)
that poems should communicate something to some-bodies is both their most
obvious obligation and their most trite ambition.  Indeed, in the
technologized communication <a 
href="../rift01/rift0101.html#bernstein">climate</a> of MTV, CNN, and the Weather Channel,
of which Rif/t obviously forms a part (however minimal), the space and
necessity for a poetry will seem at once desperate and doomed.

<p>
     
4.)   As David Antin observes in an improvised talk-poem (thinking perhaps of
Wittgenstein)--we use words in an extremely loose fashion.  So my 'pain' is
almost certainly not your 'pain'; only, out of generosity, (or is it the
compromise of practicality) we tune out this noise, surviving in the
'seeming' of the gap bridged.  The drama of a poem's making--in native
tongue--is its engagement with the same burderns as translation: the
shaping of words into forms intelligible in and for these worlds of ours. 

<p>

<a name="transparent">5.)  Talking/writing</a> outside of their home 
languages, Cecilia Vicu&ntilde;, Jorge
Guitart, and Dubravka Djuric remind us that language (or the poem) is
'agon' and not, however much it seems so, a form within a <a href="edit0401.html#transparent">transparent</a>
medium.  However instantaneously these words appear on this screen (at the
click of the proverbial icon even), they are implicated in the devouring
electric hum and industrial noise of Lima, Peru as Vicun~a describes it. 
The intrusion of the P.A. system into the performance of her poem registers
this repeated rift:
<pre>
     so ahhh 
     i will not repeat the kinds of things 
     that i was saying 
     because they are better
     lost
</pre>

<p>

6.)  It is difficult to say what is being carried over when one
translates a poem, in the traditional sense, bringing it from Spanish
into English.  If the poem is its language, its image nexus, its
<a href="edit0401.html#homophonic">sounds</a>, its shape on page or screen, its past and future performances--
there can be hardly be a stable sense of the 'what' which we have 
brought across or what even there could have been on the backslash's left
side that would have been susceptible to being carried. 

<p>

7.)  In the carrying, in the riffing movement of 'whatever'
to 'wherever', we open up the possibilities for poetry, a bounty of
readings, which may begin to suggest that poems exist not simply
in their artifactual forms but in the kinetic of their makings,
remakings, and readings.  Some of the poems in this special issue 
of Rif/t are translated in a non-traditional fashion, one which
will disturb many an seasoned poetaster.  The fidelity of many is not 
so much to an original--since carrying over the poem, if poem is 
conceived in a full sense, is impossible--as to an ethic of transpoesis. 
That the carrying should be acknowledged as an act of making, an act
of poetic <a href="bale0401.html#notes">intervention</a> rather than representation, is not the apologia 
for the typical 'compromises involved in translation' except insofar as the
very fact of making a poem out of 'words', the limited tools of one's own
lexia and of language structure, should itself also be seen as a failure.

<p>

8.)  We have then translations by <a 
href="rift0401.html#guitart1">Guitart</a>, <a href="baud0401.html">Howe</a>, <a href="rift0401.html#bernstein">Bernstein</a> and 
others inspired by an extreme materialism; and we have the materially
inspired poems in translation from the extremes of Haiti, France, Italy,
Argentina, China, Korea and the former Yugoslavia.  Spinelli's <a href="spin0401.html">Satie poem</a>
and Cecilia <a href="vicu0401.html">Vicu&ntilde;a</a>'s transcribed talk-poem remind that the problems and
poesis of translation extend beyond transfer from the German page to the
English page.  The work of Jerome Rothenberg, Dennis Tedlock, and David
Antin (as precursors) might be acknowledged here, for its attention to the 
poem's body, its sounds, performance qualities, and social context--crucial
reminders, as is Vicu&ntilde;a's joke on whites carrying notebooks, that the 
poem-as-print-object is the anomaly in the larger history of poetry.

<p>

9.)  Some readers will no doubt be troubled by the liberties taken in 
the more free translations.  No definitive translations are presented here
(though many are accomplished enough that in other spaces such authority
would be claimed for them); instead we have a dialog of texts, an
ice-breaking conversational game with few rules.  Unable to 
offer any 'get-out-of-jail-free' poems, the editors of Rif/t urge you to
roll; if you Pass Go, collect $200.

<p>


10.)  An Irish poet recently wrote, "I want a poem to die in."  Call 
this the Grecian Urn aesthetic, and publish it always in red-leather 
bound volumes with gold filigree.  Dubravka Djuric's poem, (which she 
gave Rif/t before returning to her Beograd home last year,) requires 
daily translation if one reads with radio news in the background:

                              THE MURMUR
                                   OF THE WATER
               differently from other languages
          Strange is the connection
               of the consonants and vocals
                         in
                    the word
     Strange is the memory of
                              the beginning
                             To break the sense of
                                   THE WORD

Strange is this town
                    But I haven't revealed yet
                    the nature of the connection
               between myself and the word
               between name and name


FLOW
          IS   
               BROKEN    
                         DISJOINED


          --from Dubravka Djuric's "<a href="djur0401.html">XXX</a>"
</pre>

11.)  All true poetry is made through a process of translation, and in the
seemingly contradictory belief that words are ultimately untranslatable.  
Both, at once--reading words as if they were not substitutible by any 
others, but in themselves constituted the poem.  Is there a use in the 
distinction between prose and poetic language?  "Poem" is a family of 
words believing it is like no other.  Otherwise it becomes the Judas of 
its own denial, mere words.  "You must not think that you do not understand
it because you cannot say it. . . in other words." (Gertrude Stein)

<p>

12.)  This poetic=(obdurate untranslatability) needs to embrace a wide range
of words: "I have seen young men, my townsmen" "lecture on nothing" "not
merely one of hegemony" "UPI--Thursday, April 20" "Set keel to breakers"
"O, but lightly."  Even the "jargon of post-structuralist thought," because
it cannot be 'said' otherwise; so whatever poetry has that is desirable
must take those forms, is fated to this physiognomy of particulars (sound
shape and style).  And these translations, these many poems aim to "work
the same street, as it were, without loss of coherence or particularlity. .
. ."  (Robert Creeley) 

<p>

13.)  In America, anyone who buys more books than clothes qualifies as an
intellectual or a poet.  "Much that has been questioned as difficult in
poetry has to do with just such matters." (RC)
