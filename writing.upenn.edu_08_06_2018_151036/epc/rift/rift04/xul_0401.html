<h3>THE CIRCUS
</h3>
<pre>


Solitude of lam&eacute;:   of what shines
what laughs doesn't cry but rather barely the mask that laughs it
          [cried
cried in the laughed
what attached to the steed, what fastened
to the hook
of the rope:
the &eacute;cuy&eacute;re:   horsetamer
who yokes plumes to her hair
pinned to what swings:   to what strings
decoys
     highwires
               cages
          animals gilded
          to the hoops
          attached     to the rings
          halos:
          hoops
          
                    the fattest woman, the bearded lady:
                    the strongest:
                    the one caught
                              in the air
                              in delirium
in the bubble of delirium
                              the magician
                              in two parts:
that which cut in two disappears
and that which festooned with jack-knives
bleeds from the hear:   that which vibrates without a net, that which
disappears

<p>
<pre>
in mirrors you cross galleries with handmirrors
     galleries, glassy, of glass and slime, vista
of "virile" virtuosity, a glassiness of rounded cape,
     or "caped": so,
because if in that abyss, or alley--he pushes down--the neck
     of the girl--
because if that fishneck, curved
     under that radiance, swims, mirror being born, jade and
     glass? he takes it, and in that crossing, of the lam&eacute;
radiance, I engrave: it cuts the circle, gives
     an "ending."  and if the shining
stroll is used, signals of green canvas
--for a green hanged man--, to go ahead, why not?
if that slipping, that hanging
     expanded?
and in the circle, of that fish-tale, a detail appears
     in "madder"? overtattooed in the decollete', dredges
the breast; of the one who brands: cut glass,
     luminous, infected sliver, whose sticking plaster, in the
alcohol of those gazes that gush, in the
     coolness of that glaze, or only the incense of that smoke
          penetrates
     the meat of the neck, marks the "small roads" of that
          gallows, as if that head, to rolll, by starched,
     stiff petticoats, took it scorched.  rhymed its
asperity of live furs, with that "brown" stole
          with which she
covered her shoulders? --hiding that hairiness and the
batrachian of that weakening, doesn't it lead
to the alligator's paws, stagnant, or arranged in a 
certain inertia? . . .
                    but that which scratches,
yes.  penetrates, and will not shut up.  not necessarily,
          [since already at the edge
     of those little swimming pools in Sarmiento,
          [there's a mother that's
     drowning, and another that's stripping naked, on the palier,
                    in front of some officials
it's that mother and that absence.  the scene, framed in
                    crystal, provides the radiance
of those paralytic spiders.  That one, and perhaps the other.
          [because,
     in rolling, through those trembling passages, didn't
she suffer the discomfort of those stays, and the suffocation of
     those buttocks, the
weight of those tiaras, or pendants, or rings, already
     excessive? and that which is recharged, in that account,
isn't it an increase, the profusion
     of jewelled straps, or the anger
          of a candle that hangs? perhaps
     heavy with heat? of
          which heaven is he speaking? oh panromances, oh
          tarnished relics of coral, oh
               rhinestones in a rut of rhyming . . .

History, is it a <a href="vicu0401.html#language">language</a>?
Does this language have to do with the language of history
or with the history of language/
where it stuttered/
Does it have to do with this verse?
living tongues licking dead tongues
tongues rotting like socks
tongues, lingering, fungous
this langauge of history/ which history?
if the long history of the <a href="djur0401.html#sentence">tongue</a> isn't taken as a story

They tell it
in a galley:

Miz Rudecinda
didn't the riding gear sprinkle her soul?
didn't the screamer bird scare itself?

(Melted gauchos, with their cow tongues, with their clubs
with their yokes and their silver coin belts
melted gaucho: he digs his spurs into the--melted--back
of the tongue, as if trapped in a rabbit warren

A few kilometers from San Clemente, in the Tuy&uacute;
is the tomb of Santos Vega, where the orcas come in
and the surfers in their grass skirts, on the crystal waves
Broken crystal, ornere orcas of history:  they go
to the harpponers with their hooks:  they go
where the deck-clearings cleave:  where, melted, the gaucho
takes out his jack-knife and disgraces himself:
it was history, that disgrace!
disgrace of lying in the Tuyu&uacute;, of a widespread lying
The cannibals in that crystal harassed by rude waves;
and you, in that lethargy of rigor mortis, don't you take it
               [lying down?
Take crystalline, plumed crests?

<h3>Don't Return . . .
</h3>
<pre>

I

Oh, mo ther look ma
ma there's
more than we foresaw:
the cupboards full of 
the walls overloaded
with white
the beds so clear
the fabric so tightly stretched
Don't return the gaze
Look:

The words are in surplus
They're idle.


II

Right there fa ther
We won it
May it be sacred:   the SHOUT
Here!
Do you hear
how my ears
how the chains 
groan
the harvest is a cloud
Hear The Sound
of locusts
--such darkenss!
but whatever happens
Their color is green.


III

Hear the sound
--broken the--
Give 
give equally
give your throne
to the nobleman

may they be united
see now:  "to the Noble of the South:
          Freedom!"

And the freemen answer
the Great:   "To die or
             We swear welcome."


IV

Hey hear the adage
I've written you
It's rough draft
Don't 
Don't return
it to final copy


V

Thrown
into the Red hot fire of the blacksmith.
I'm still alive.

He picks among the irons
looking for his knife
to put it into the fire
to make it:   a dagger.


To break the broken chains
to see the ties leaking
the iron of this blood.
Ferrous blood
of iron, they say
the man was made
of iron.
He who branded the Red
Count his wounds.
He wandered
wandered lonely
at ease 
they say
in The Outskirts.


VI

There were weapons and tools, between which, therefore,
They distinguished by usage.


VII

We won it, father.
We 
won it
father,
or we will.


Hadding had 
Having
If it has
Hah!


How much it costs for the Splendor
to shine.

unexpected ruled leaves fall from him

they buried their dead seated in more or less the same position
we were in, in the water
with the small, trivial things they'd loved or enjoyed in life
but it springs up and dies back alone and now
and it dreams itself alone and dreams are idiotic
we're together, naked, neither dead nor alive
each dreaming our own useless story
in the maternal bathtub, as alike as twins
the heavens the sky and the earth.  and the earth
were emptiness and confusion

Every end is a beginning.  Searches
The engineer's arches built brick by brick treaon on treason looking       
	  [for what
The mayor dressed as a peasant crossing the continent on horseback
          [looking for what
Woman's pools, the hunger for depth, do they matter?

Each search pursues its end--and finishes before reaching it
Unrelenting, unreachable searches.  Lost arches, for example
The crumbs that showed the path back disappeared.  Birds

The strap falls.  The bird takes flight.  Where
Don't pay attention to mummy.  She drank too much.  She writes mush.

Every persecution has an end: to make its beginning infinite; so
The engineer reads Hegel "there's no depth just ignorance" and        
	  [approaches the abyss.  Later
The engineer denigrates "limitless emptiness": fear of limitless
          [ignorance, or his own emptiness
Horror at perpetual beginning
Each month is each day is each hour is each moment is
Time past and present that which is and that which was
Madness    the invisible marks that return
The impossible union of beginning and end
The impossible family and its new records, its beautiful story, its

Every end breaks the enchantment
The twelve strokes sound
They're at the door
The engineer reads his family the sotry and suddenly flees:
Partridges in pear trees.  Did they live happily ever after?  searches
Every beginning is an end.  The agonized end
Of a story that doesn't want to finish

(From "Diary of the Flight")

Thursday the twenty-fourth
I have to keep going
I can't keep going
I found a dead horse in the tub                            (in the bath)
the horse gets up
the quitable moment in which he leaves me     (the firm moment in which)
Friday the twenty-fifth
I have to keep going               	              (I can keep going)
a slow trot:
maybe the path is near
they've already made it
somehow I get to the threshold
onto my story                            (maybe I'm arriving at my story)

my interrogators   know   more than I

yes, everything seems foreign  virginal   a worthless fable

(...)

I wish   the lantern in the night  showed

the   broken hymen   of the priestess


that the vagina opened in   flower   that there were no trap

that the image were the delay  a fall  one could live in

(...)

the questions close me  confuse   I can't

I wish or even  to pronounce the word end
