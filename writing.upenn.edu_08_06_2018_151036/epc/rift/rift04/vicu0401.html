<h3>Cecilia  Vicu&ntilde;a</h3><p>

From a performance at SUNY Buffalo, 10 March 1994<p>


<p>

. . . .

<p>


[Finished singing, Cecilia hangs a loop of shells that she's
been shaking on the microphone.]
<p>




when we were asked to come here and speak<br>
lets say about myth<br>
the first thing that comes to mind is that <br>
of course<br>
<p>

just the name myth<br>
is a name<br>
being seen or being said from the outside<br>
and<br>
if I wanted to say just one thing about it its that<br>
as I perceive it<br>

<p>


<a name="language">perhaps</a> <br>
The myth for us<br>
is <a href="xul_0401.html#perlonger.history">language</a><br>
just plain words and<br>

<p>

and then words<br>

<p>

as I percieve them<br>
they are time<br>

<p>

simply <br>
time<br>

<p>

and sound<br>

<p>

written<br>
and sound<br>

<p>

breathing<br>

<p>


and there's an ancient tradition that says that the voice is the<br>
bridge<br>
that through the thread of voice<br>

<p>

we cross dimensions

<p>

because the universe has been created by sound<br>
this is a common idea in ancient india<br>
and in the ancient andes<br>
so we create<br>
by sound<br>

<p>

and the word that we use now<br>
<a href="djur0401.html">SOUND</a><br>
son&iacute;do en espa&ntilde;ol <br>
originally<br>
in this proto-european language<br>
which is the mother language which we speak in English<br>
it was swen<br>
and swen means Shunt<br>
an incantation<br>
so even in indo-european languages sound<br>
was <a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/rift/rift04/rift0401#friedlander">incantation</a><br>

<p>

now

<p>

because of this <br>
almost funny request to speak of myth<br>
i would just like to say<br>
a couple of myths that are pertinent I think to this moment<br>

<p>

both from south america<br>
one of them <br>
is a contemporary myth<br>
one that accounts for the origin of <br>
people <br>
who write <br>
and people <br>
who sing<br>

<p>

and in this myth<br>
the gods have created<br>
the indigenous people of south america and<br>
they have created them with great memory so<br>
only through sound<br>
they can remember the history <br>
of the whole<br>
people<br>

<p>

so <br>
instead<br>
the gods created some people<br>
who have no memory so because they have not<br>
this gift of memory <br>
they were created with a little notebook in their hands<br>

<p>

and these people are the europeans<br>

<p>

so <br>
that is one myth i wanted to recall for you<br>
and then there is another one<br>
that<br>
I particularly love<br>
this is a myth<br>
of<br>
ahh<br>
a creature<br>
also contemporary myth<br>
and this creature lives in the outskirts of contemporary lima<br>
i don't know if you know about lima   lima<br>
is like the quintessential mestizo city<br>
a city created by the whites that cannot admit<br>
even to this moment of being <br>
quite in peru<br>
that is to say<br>
quite in the andes<br>
this could be said of santiago<br>
the city where i come from [louder]<br>
can [louder]<br>
you're not hearing me? [no, ...can't hear you at all]<br>
not at all? <br>
[no...nah]<br>
[laughs]<br>
you see <br>
talking about sound<br>
i am sick<br>
that is the problem<br>
i have a sore throat<br>
what do I do<br>
[you can't turn that up? can you turn the mike up?]<br>
if i try to speak louder<br>
it will only<br>

<p>


[let's take a three minute pause, to set the PA up]

<p>

. . . . .

<p>

so ahhh<br>
i will not repeat the kinds of things<br>
that i was saying<br>
because they are better<br>
lost<br>

<p>

[laughs]

<p>

but i will pick up with the pistasho<br>
pistacho?   no<br>
pi<br>
BPIII'schtako<br>
the BPII'schtaKo myth<br>
because i don't think you want to miss that one<br>
and so<br>
i was saying that this is a contemporary myth<br>
about sound <br>
and in the outskirts of lima<br>
this creature called the BPI'stako lives<br>
and this creature has been ahh<br>
placed there by the europeans <br>
and his purpose is to eat up all the indians<br>
that come down the city<br>
to find jobs<br>
so when you come into the city<br>
you here this hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br>

<p>

like youre hearing right now<br>
and the hummmmm of all machines<br>
of airplanes and cars and so forth<br>
is the sound of this BPIII'schtako<br>
that has eaten up<br>
and is continuing to eat all the indians<br>
so industrial noisze ISz the lament <br>
of the indians that have been eaten up<br>
so <br>
hhuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br>

<p>

that's it<br>

<p>

we really like lament<br>
lament is what makes us <br>
the weeping and the crying<br>
so Jos&eacute; Lezama Lima says<br>
Light is the first visible animal of the invisible<br>

<p>

?Adooo&oacute;nde vaaaan los suuuuaves inuuuum&eacute;ros....<br>
