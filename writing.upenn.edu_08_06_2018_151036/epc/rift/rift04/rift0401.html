<p>
Ningun problema tan consustancial con las letras y con su modesto
misterio como el que propone una traduccion.<br>
J. L. Borges, 'Las Versiones Homericas', Discusion, 1957
<p>

No problem is as completely concordant with literature and with the
modest mystery of literature as is the problem posed by a translation.

Yours the hour<br>
Mine the pout<br>
Theirs the power

With this lip<br>
With this silence<br>
With these words<br>
Of no reliance

(adapted from Paul Celan, "Selbdritt, Selbviert," _Gedichte 1_, p. 216)
<p>
Ken,<br>
going through old manuscripts i discovered an attempt to make english an
uncharacteristically brechtian poem of celan's, which you're welcome to 
use if you'd like.  for the sake of rhymes & other such stuff i varied 
the poem enough that i wanted to call it "after celan."  the german title (&
i haven't figured out why) is "threesome, foursome."  a somewhat more literal
variant translation of the second stanza would be:

<p>
 
     This the minute<br>
     Yours the minute<br>
     Mine the mouth<br>
     Your words in it<br>
 <br>
anyway, let me know what's what.  if this isn't what you're after that's
cool.<br>

<h3>In Memory of Ferdinand</h3>
<p>
Here is the poem that I sent Ernesto.  The caps mean to convey strong stress
in the original language. I met this poet personally when I visited him in
Plitaca, the capital of his country, Tuncory. The langauge is called
Detaltsnart in Detaltsnart--don't know what the anglicized version is.  The
rhythms in Detaltsnart  are similar to those of Glishen which in turn are
similar to those of English, & Jerg is given like me to parody.

<h3>"N" Number of Questions on Translation</h3><p>

<h4>Constructed by Ernesto Livon Grosman.</h4>
<p>
Between the months of October 1994 and February 1995
G. J. Racz wrote a series of letters in reference to
the translation of several poems for an anthology
of Argentine poetry that will be published this fall
by Roof Books.  What follows are excerpts of the
questions that G. J. Racz attached to those letters.
I am fully responsible for the selection of those excerpts.<br>
[E.L.G.]

<p>

<i>"N" Number of  Questions on Translation
or I Hope This Letter Finds You Well</i>

<p>

I think the "circle" to the right contains one less word<br>
in English than in Spanish, and so causes a bit of a rift<br>
between the two versions.

<p>

Is "manita" "small hand" or "sparse manna"?<br>

<p>

Is "apreta" an imperative?<br>

<p>

Does a "stampeding mob/ digest?"<br>

<p>

I also do not repeat the verb "desafina" but use<br>
"a false note" as the direct object of "repite".  Problem?<br>

<p>

What do you think of "a slave to fashion" for<br>
"la tran-tran de la moda"?<br>

<p>

What is "plin"?<br>

<p>

I write "trusted fairy-girl" for "ahijada," trying to<br>
salvage "hija," "hada" and "fiada."  Your thoughts.<br>

<p>

What do we do with "pavo...empavesado"?<br>

<p>

I don't understand who is falling off what?<br>

<p>

To what or whom does the three "su"'s refer to?<br>

<p>

Can you think of another word for "desplanta"<br>
that keeps "plant" in the root?<br>

<p>

I sense that the second "como" in the second<br>
stanza should be "as if," but do we keep it as<br>
"like" for the symmetry, or  translate it as<br>
"as if" along with the last instance in which<br>
it appears "("like cut")?<br>

<p>

Is there a reason for the slash "/79" in the original,<br>
or is my apostrophe OK?<br>

<p>

I took license in translating "cada espera" as<br>
"the pregnant moments" because this line can go with<br>
either the preceding line or the following one.<br>

<p>

I put "pampa" in the plural (twice) for English readers.<br>

<p>

"Se mezclaron" has too many nuances.  What do you think of<br>
"mingled and mixed" to conserve the idea of being swapped?<br>

<p>

What is "sutural," "stitch-like"?<br>

<p>

Is "el coso" the "thing"?<br>

<p>

And I also omit the "es que" in the following line.<br>
Does this hurt the sense?<br>

<p>

What about "at the urging of the heights"?<br>

<h3>Translation is Stepping</h3>
<pre>
                Translation is Stepping from Oneself

                                                to the Next

3.

trans late (trans-lat, tranz-, trans lat, tranz-) v. -lated, -lating, -lates.
6.  Theology.  To convey to heaven without natural death.  8.  Archaic.  To
transport; enrapture.


        "So perhaps dreaming and writing do have to do with
        journeying through the world, using all the available
        means of transport, using your own body as a form of
        transport."

                                                --Cixous


What I want to say is this: <a name="dunlop.bird">All</a> these birds in and around me.  Are small
bobbing sites of translation.  EEP. EEP.  EEP.  Each bird a little poem. 
See they emerge from my palms.  Beaks and wings and tiny bald heads pressing
through my skin.  I shake my hands to dislodge them.  Up and out they go. 
EEP.  EEP.  Good bye.

Transformation.  They do not leave.  They hover in clouds around me.  Visions
of birds like letters in the sky.  Translation is many sitings of birds.
Citations.  They carry me.  From one &gt;place&lt; to another.  They make me
into something else.  <a href="revi0401.html#seeless">They make me</a>. Into them.


                TRANSLATE

                                TRANSLATEN

                                                TRANSPORT


Wings that bear me like cargo.


        TRANSLATUS

                        TRANSFERRE

                                        CARRY

                                                        ACROSS


Here in the hold of the dream boat.  The night a vast sea.  Down here my
astonished body curls in sleep between one shore and the next.


        TEL

                TELOS

                        TOLERARE

                                        TO BEAR


Words, how much can you hold of the day we are leaving?  You spin from my
dream like netting.  A thousand meanings adhere to you.  Strain your seams 
to bursting.


                TAL

                        TALIO

                                RETALIATE


From one shore to the next.  Words, you betray the dreamer.  Seize up and
shun what we want you to say.  You dissolve before our very closed eyes.  
The dream evaporates.  Leaves us.  Never leaves us.  We are enchanted.


                        TANTAL

                                TANTALUS

                                        TANTALIZE


We are enchanted.  It is a sexual thing.  The boat rocks and tingles and we
are happy in our bodies.  We are not having the dream.  The <a
href="edit0401.html#birds">dream has us</a>, 
carries us, gives us back to our selves.  The night continues.


                        LATUS

                                  CARRIED

                                                BORNE


And I am cargo in this gliding boat.  This boat a mighty bird.  From where 
I sleep I hear its wings around me.  They move up and fall.  Up and fall.  
Up and fall.  I am falling.  I am borne to dreaming's edges.


                        TOLLERE

                                        TO LIFT


These wings are my wings.  A memory of the night inside words.  I will
remember this.

<h3>Four Poems</h3>
<h4>Translated by Walter K. Lew</h4>
<p>
<pre>

</pre>
<h5>Poem no.  XIII</h5>
<p>
     Holding the razorblade my arms became severed and fell off.  Looking
closer I see how cold and pale they are as if seriously threatened by
something.  Confronted with this I stood my pair of lost arms up as
candlesticks to ornament my room with.  The arms are dead but seem to show
all the more nothing but fear of me.  Such frail etiquette I consider more
lovely than any flower basin.
<p>


<h5>Poem no. II</h5>
<p>
     when my father dozes off beside me i become my father and also i become
my father's father and even so while my father like my father why do i
repeatedly my father's father's father's... when i become a father why must i
lopingly leap over my father and why am i that which while finally playing
all at once my and my father's and my father's father's and my father's
father's father's roles must live?
<p>
<h5>Poem no. X</h5>
<p>
     In the tattered wallpaper I see a butterfly dying.  Secret mouthpiece
bearing endless traffic to and from the other world.  One day in the mirror I
see on my beard a butterfly dying.  Wings collapsed in exhaustion the
butterfly eats the meager dew that collects glistening out of my exhaled
breath.  If I die while blocking the mouthpiece off with my palm the
butterfly too as if starting up after resing shall fly away.  Never do I let
any word of this leak out.
<p>


<h5>Poem no. XI</h5>
<p>
     That porcelain cup resembles my skull.  I was grasping the cup tight
with my hand when out of my arm another arm absurdly sprouted like a grafted
branch and the hand pending from that arm grabbed the cup in a flash raised
and hurled it against the floor.  My arm is defending the porcelain cup to
the death and so the shattered peices of course are my skull which resembles
the procelain cup.  If my arm had budged before the branching arm like a 
snake crept back into it the white paper holding back the flood water would 
have torn. But just as before my arm defends the porcelain cup to the death.

<h3>China Poems</h3>

<p>
Head note to my China poems<br>

I entered China the way Roland Barthes entered Japan.  "Without words."
(_EMPIRE OF SIGNS_)  Leaving his own language behind, as I did mine, 
Barthes enveloped himself in what he called "the murmuring mass of an 
unknown language."  He moved  with "a faint vertigo" that swept him into 
"its artificial emptiness,"  an emptiness "consummated" only for him and 
"the pure significance" of which he grasped. Writing: "I live in the 
interstice, delivered from any full meaning." Just so.  My China poems 
were written on the inside of "a great envelope empty of speech" because 
"all the alienations of the mother tongue," English for me, were halted 
at my ears by "an auditory film"--the Chinese language, my murmuring mass.  
Translating that murmuring mass is the work my China poems are about. 

<p>



<h3>Beijing Bird Men
</h3>
are beautiful,<br>
unlikely and strange<br>
as the word is,<br>
having to do with men.<br>
They have retired,<br>
as in China<br>
by law at sixty<br>
they must,<br>
but they are not old.<br>
Late in the afternoon,<br>
in a brown city,<br>
they come together<br>
in parks without names,<br>
wherever green is.<br>
Beijing bird men<br>
no longer<br>
have drowsy emperors<br>
to keep awake,<br>
but still their birds,<br>
with soft beaks<br>
in bamboo cages,<br>
sing. Still they sing.<br>
<p>

<h3>The Man Who Washed His Ears
</h3>
for Shen Congwen, 1902-1988,<br>
one of China's greatest writers,<br>
and his people . . .<br>

<p>

Shen Congwen, the same man, <br>
who wrote books in China all his life<br>
no matter what was in them<br>
so long as he believed it.<br>
Who said: "I never believed in power. <br>
Wisdom is more important."<br>
Who was made to suffer<br>
during the Cultural Revolution.<br>
Who was punished for his books.<br>
Shen Congwen, the same man, <br>
who was "rehabilitated" by Chairman Mao <br>
who had a different plan for him,<br>
who called him in and "invited" him <br>
to write for the people.<br>
Shen Congwen, the same man, <br>
who had given himself in China all his life <br>
to writing for the people.<br>
Who heard Chairman Mao out <br>
and said: "Isn't it nice to be in demand."<br>
The same man who washed his ears<br>
and wrote nothing ever again.<br>
Power, wisdom. Shen Congwen.<br>

<p> <a name="haiti"> </a> <h2>4 Poems from Haiti
</h2>
<a name="kastra"> </a>
<h2>Joj Kastra (Georges Castera)</h2>

 <h3>    Translated by Jack Hirschman from Haitian 
</h3>
<h4>Zilch Movement</h4>
 <br>
Poverty makes all things faded,<br>
crooked, cracked, emaciated,<br>
wasted away, dingy, stupid, ground-down,<br>
pocked;<br>
when it's finished<br>
we're trading laughter for weeping<br>
we're swapping misery with brothers<br>
in order to clutch at a blade of grass.<br>

<p>

On Saturdays, the whole town on the coast<br>
gets off by throwing their bodies into the sea<br>
like people in heat.<br>

<p>

Hereabouts, life burns!<br>


<p>

<h4>Both Today and Yesterday</h4>
 <br>
all our lives,<br>
forks without teeth<br>

<p>

all our lives,<br>
the backs of spoons,<br>

<p>

both today and yesterday.<br>
<p>
a country in transit<br>
over all the sea's roaring,<br>
<p>
a land of poverty escalating<br>
on all sides,<br>
<p>
a land where every lie is<br>
this big<br>
<p>
with life in danger of death.<br>
<p>
a sidewinding land<br>
where all the clock hands<br>
<p>
are working rushrush<br>
ticktock ticktock ticktock ticktock<br>
<p>
inside out-of-work heads<br>
who see their lives hanging<br>
<p>
like banana leaves<br>
kneeling on the ground.<br>
<p>
a land scabby in the hand<br>
for the profit of shameless hustlers<br>
<a name="haiti.god"></a><p>
who make the price of each piece of bread<br>
skyrocket<br>
<p>
both today and yesterday.<br>
<p>
all things<br>
stir in prayer<br>
<p>
both today and yesterday.<br>
<p>
<a href="xul_0401.html#perednik">gods</a> come cheaply<br>
just like whacks of clubs on your ass,<br>
<p>
both today and yesterday.<br>
<p>
where's the change?<br>
where's the workers' union?<br>
where's agrarian reform?<br>
<p>
yesterday climbs aboard the belly of today<br>
with its military hat.<br>
that is, both today, as with yesterday,<br>
Haiti stays down on the skin of its ass.<br>
<p>

<h2>Felix Morisseau-Leroy
</h2>
  <h3>   Translated from Haitian by Jack Hirschman
</h3>

<h4>Sometimes I'm not Myself</h4>
 <br>
Sometimes I'm not myself<br>
There's a wild loa dancing in my head<br>
A sorrowful loa which stamps on the ground<br>
When it's like that I'm not myself<br>
There's a huge drum beating in my heart<br>
A marvelous voodoo is dancing in my body<br>
When it's like that I can't say 'darling'<br>
It's comrade-friend I call you<br>
If you take hold of my hand<br>
There's a loa of revolution that's boiling in my blood<br>
My horse is saddled<br>
I'm set to go<br>
A lambi of revolution is sounding<br>
If you've the courage take my hand<br>
My horse is saddled<br>
Let's go.<br>

<p>

Note: translator Hirschman prefers Haitian to Creole in referring to the<br>
popular language of Haiti.<br>

<h2>Jacques Viau</h2>

 <h3>    Translated from French by Robert Anbian</h3>

<h4>TEARS AND MORE TEARS</h4>
 <br>
Man walks on, accumulating words of redemption<br>
along with his bits of crust, folds himself up with torn hands,<br>
and displays his tattoo of a mutilated life.<br>

<p>

They deposited his head in a basket.<br>
They put it up for bids.<br>
Along his road they placed candelabra,<br>
votive candles, black veils, steel necklaces.<br>
He mustn't forget he has but one road.<br>
He mustn't forget his life belongs to others,<br>
that his life isn't for himself, that<br>
it has never been for himself.<br>
And that he walks along, dragging a bum's overcoat,<br>
nourished by fever and a large sky,<br>
by words and alleyways shrieking<br>
in his ears. And yet,<br>
man isn't born only to bite the dust<br>
and swallow his words.<br>
He isn't born to contemplate<br>
a wail, but to draw it out<br>
like a weapon <br>
to pierce the wall of the prevailing ache.<br>

<p>

It's necessary to search out the entrepreneurs of death.<br>
It's necessary to knock even without hands.<br>
It's necessary to scream even without voice <br>
against those who provoke tears<br>
with their grand smiles.<br>
Humankind hasn't had the time to laugh,<br>
only to bite the dust.<br>
Look at the heart of humanity-<br>
a handful of blood under the sky.<br>
Look at the heart of humanity-<br>
star folded in a shadow.<br>

<p>

Look at it,<br>
tear speeding on moldy rails.<br>
Look at the heart of humanity-<br>
knot of rage sustained by blood.<br>
Man and woman,<br>
here is your face and flesh;<br>
Brave youth, here is the grave already excavated.<br>
O poor youth! You didn't leave to the earth<br>
the fruit of your seed.<br>
They didn't give you the time.<br>
But it doesn't matter.<br>
I am your son<br>
and I will raise my voice in your name<br>
because your lips have left their imprint on mine.<br>

<p>

Jacques Viau Renaud was a Haitian student studying in the Dominican Republic
in 1965 when U.S. Marines invaded that country to put down a popular
insurrection. He took up arms in solidarity with the insurrectionists and was
killed in the fighting on the 21st of June. Remembered as the "poet of one
island and two nations," he was 23 years old when he died.
