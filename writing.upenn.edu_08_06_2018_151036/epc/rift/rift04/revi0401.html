     Theory is no longer to be laughed at by poets. 
It <i>is</i> no longer laughed at by poets of common
understanding.  It has assumed the majesty of an art; and,
as an art, ranks among the most important which can engage
the attention of thinking beings--this too, whether we
consider it merely as an object of speculative inquiry, or
as involving consequences of the highest practical
magnitude.  As poetic study it is very extensively
accredited in Cambridge, in Vancouver, in Buffalo, and in
San Francisco.  Some of its earliest and most violent
opposers have been converted to its use.  We may instance
Leslie Scalapino who wrote <i>How Phenomena Appear to
Unfold</i>.  Nearly all of the New York School has been
brought over to belief--in spite of the Poetry Project
Newsletter and its ill-sustained opinions.  Yet these latter
were considered of so great weight that Bob Perelman was
induced to move to the East Coast for the purpose of
refuting them.  There, with O'Hara's <i>Collected</i> in one
hand, and a copy of Barthes' <i>Mythologies</i> in the other, he
delivered a lecture before a number of assemblies, among
whom was the author of the most virulent attack which
perhaps the art has ever received.  At this single lecture
in Kentucky he is said to have gained five hundred
converts to Theory, and the Eastern States are now the
strong hold of the faith.
 
<p>

     In regard to the uses of Theory--its most
direct, and, perhaps, most salutary, is that of <i>self-
examination and self-knowledge</i>.  It is contended that, with
proper caution, and well-directed inquiry, individuals may
obtain, through the art, a perfectly accurate estimate of
their own intellectual capabilities--and, thus instructed,
will be the better fitted for decision in regard to a
choice of subjects and projects in writing.  But there are
other and scarcely less important uses too numerous to
mention--at least here.
 
<p>

      The beautiful little work now before us was
originally printed in France, in a manner unknown, by P.O.L.,
a well known publisher of avant garde poetry.  The present
edition, brought out by a newcomer in the field, is in any
event exceedingly neat and convenient--we presume that it
means to be nothing more.

<p>
 
          The sequence consists of 51 poems, each
constructed from a random pattern of one-, two- and
three-line stanzas, and with no poem extending beyond a
single page.  Proper names abound, usually first names and
place names, and there are many references to envelopes,
to glass, to pebbles, and to photography.  Vacation and
friendship are the superficial <i>motifs</i> of this
autobiographical work, whose precise length conforms to the
author's age at the time of composition.
 
<p>

          The 51 poems are each printed on the <i>recto</i> of
a page whose <i>verso</i> remains white, creating the effect of
an <i>en face</i> translation--with this difference, that the
English reflects a blank original, an empty page.  Given Mr.
Hocquard's intentions, the presentation is an apt one.  His
afterword, "Grammatical Unrest," describes <i>Theory of
Tables</i> as a "continuation" of the author's translation of
Michael Palmer's <i>Baudelaire Series</i> into French.  Since the
English version of the present poem has been rendered by
this self-same Mr. Palmer, we might also infer that
Palmer's <i>Theory of Tables</i> is <i>also</i> a continuance of
<i>Baudelaire Series</i>--<b>his own</b> continuation.  However that
may be, the relationship between translation and original,
between original and its source of inspiration, is very
much at issue.  Accuracy is not the point; that is, the
book itself, giving one text only, in one language, does not
invite the reader to gauge discrepancy, to make comparison. 
Comparison, discrepancy, accuracy--what I would call
<i>tabular</i> reading--are <i>themes</i> of the sequence, but not
its point.  To read in a tabular fashion would mean
entering the work, while Mr. Hocquard's goal--and perhaps
Mr. Palmer's also--is to keep the reader at an admiring
distance, with attention focused on the surface.  (The
model is painting--looking at paintings in a museum.)  We
could say much more on this matter, but space does not
permit.  This, in any case, is Mr. Hocquard's <i>Theory</i>.
 
<p>

          At page 7 is a brief flurry of negative
statements beginning "Poem, you're not a square of lines,"
well conceived and well adapted to their purpose which is--
to convey by a casual or superficial denial of events, an
idea of what propensities, sentiments, or faculties, most
distinguish the work as a whole.  It is after remarked, (at
page 8,) that "The grooves run in all directions / they
stop at one edge," and "This edge does not belong."  The
second page is a continuation of the first, and both
constitute a single translation of Mr. Hocquard's chief
conceit, that the lines of a graph and the grooves of a
hard surface equally form tables which are and are not
models for the poem.  Indeed, the very "line" that denies
forming a square, the very "edge" that excludes itself from
consideration, helps form the outline, and helps contribute
to the character, of a surface of language that as a whole
constructs a theoretical, if not actual, Table.

<p>
 
          Some passages in Mr. Hocquard's little book have
a peculiar interest.  At page 9 we find what follows.
<pre> 
          "In Blue Monastery Square
          coming toward me I saw the Clerk of Origins
          hemiplegic Professor of the Level
 
          Where is the center and where
          is the center of what I see in the mirror?
 
          While Charles Bernstein was discussing Charles Reznikoff
          This mirror exploded in the distance"
 </pre>

<p>
          At page 21, in a section beginning "You say
someone has written poems," and ending "Organize your
reading around these details," we meet with the very
sensible and necessary observation that we must not
consider the denial of particular and instinctive
propensities of language, as acquitting us of the
responsibility of understanding.  On the contrary it is the
perversity of the author's statements which causes the
greatest difficulty we endure, and for which (having the
free exercise of <i>reason</i>) we remain accountable to the
poem.
<pre> 
          The following is quoted from page 24.
 
          "I offer you the originals
          maybe there you'll see
          what you don't see"
 
          The words annexed occur at page 27.
 
          "This book remains open on a table
          who will finish writing it?
 
          Dear Keith, thanks for bringing that book
          and the double of that book
          my hands are full of glass
 
          One sees something
          but doesn't see what it is"
 
          And at page 31.
 
          "You say you don't see me
          _you see less and less_"
 </pre>

<p>

          And again at page 32 (with a shift in emphasis
that speaks volumes about Hocquard's Theory):
<p>
<pre>
 
          "You say I don't see you
          I see less and less"
</pre>

<p>

          To this may be added the statement of Derrida,
with regard to his Theory of dissimulation, expressed in his
essay "How to Avoid Speaking:  Denials."  "To avoid
speaking, to delay the moment when one will have to say
something and perhaps acknowledge, surrender, impart a
secret, one amplifies the digressions."  The charm of Mr.
Hocquard's poem lies precisely in its amplification of
digression.  Whether his avoidance is worth waiting out is
another matter altogether.
