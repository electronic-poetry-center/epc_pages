                  CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS



          ----/   T R A N S P O I E S I S   /----



                 A SPECIAL FEATURE ISSUE OF

RIF/T: An Electronic Space for Poetry, Prose and Poetics

       Dedicated to WRITINGS IN =/= ON TRANSLATION


          +--------------------------------------------+
          |  TRANSLATION--n., 1. expression in another |
          |  language [* see below], systematically    |
          |  retaining _ORIGINAL SENSE_.               |
          +--------------------------------------------+




Somewhere in between the poetic's of transgression & the Transportation Mt.
School, after the small press Revolution, but before the *evolutionary*
mimesis of Virtual Reality, our sense of the "original" would seem to have
been lost.  Along with this went the original sense that one, as writer,
should have been looking out looking for "it".  Perhaps, in the geographies
of poetry, this seerlessness locates us at the transection of
writing-as-translation and translation-as-writing.


TRANSPOIESIS--[change/motion/making].  What would such a poetics of excess
            look like, sound like; what would be the texture of a "TRANS"
                             released from the zero-sum game of one-to-one
                                                correspondences?



With poetic riffs from Argentinian, French, Italian, Mexican,
Serbian, Spanish,. . .  & U.S. experimental writers, RIF/T 4.1
will be less concerned with recovering `foreign' originals for
a representation in English, than with creative, improvisatory
registration of a RANGE of possibilities.  What happens when an
electronic journal thinks to become transnational?
