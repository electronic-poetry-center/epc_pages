                    XXX

The   flow   of   the   words   in   the    sequence   is
                    broken
                              <a name="sentence">Shore</a> is unusually calm
          for this part of the year
               No full stops
                         No full stops
                         No commas
               Some capital letters and heap of small letters
                    stringing one by one


                    Rock's surrounded by water
                    Waves strike at it
                              Rock-fish
                         Steep way
                                   sheep's bridlepaths

Sentence need not to have sense
                    I play with
                     SENSE OF
                     SENSELESSNESS
     Rain falls on the water's
     surface
     Rain falls on the water's
     surface
          Every drop hit water's
          surface
               Music
                  pure music
                of the phenomenon
.....     .....     .....
                              .....     .....     .....

                         Language cannot imitate
                         the sound of poem\water

                           even when saying word
                                   MURMUR
                          is not the same
                    as when
                              you hear music
                         pure music of phenomenon

It is strange being again in the town at the sea in the winter
Memories of the past time
are uncertain
     Sentence follows the sense
                                   of words
                         I play with
                        THE SENSELESSNESS
                           OF THE SENSE 
                    Every word of speech is drowned
                    into
                         THE LANGUAGE
Sentence follows the flow of the consciousness
                                   Syllables
                                   voices
                                     whose sense is
                                        in rhythm
                                        in sound

                                                  that repeat itself
                              pure music of phenomenon

.....     .....     .....
                              .....     .....     .....


               Shore is strange for this part of the year
            this sentence has no meaning
               does not fit into the natural order

                              Steepness of the hill
                                        is
                                   steepness of the word
                    word disappears in
                                        LANGUAGE
.....     .....     .....
                              .....     .....     .....

               Flow of the words is incoherent
                    It's not in my nature
                    breaking semantic and syntax rules
                              Is it not the fear
                                      of
                              SENSELESSNESS
                                 OF SENSE
                                    ?

It is strange being again
in this town
in winter
Memories are cloudy
                    Break the sense of the words
                    Break the sense of the sentences
     Every whole is 
a way of reality
                    Rock is covered with water
                    Word covers the meaning
     strange is the shore
                         Flow is broken
               Drops
                              .....     .....     .....
Break the structure
                              .....     .....     .....
               of sentences and words
                         at the surface of water
                              at the surface of meaning

                  it is strange
                to see planes of reality
                         play
.....     .....     .....
                    .....     .....     .....
                    My language experience
                              THE MURMUR
                                   OF THE WATER
               differently from other languages
          Strange is the connection
               of the consonants and vocals
                         in
                    the word
     Strange is the memory of
                              the beginning
                             To break the sense of
                                   THE WORD

trange is this town
                    But I haven't revealed yet
                    the nature of the connection
               between myself and the word
               between name and name


FLOW
          IS   
               BROKEN    
                         DISJOINED

.....     .....     .....
                              .....     .....     .....
