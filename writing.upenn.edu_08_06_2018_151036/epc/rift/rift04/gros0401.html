<h5>TWO OR THREE THINGS I KNOW ABOUT MY COUNTRY (CLUB)</h5>
<h6>Brief note to a selection of poems in translation from the Argentine 
Magazine XUL<h6>
<p>

At the beginning of the eighties and in the middle of the military 
dictatorship
that started in 1976 and finished in 1983, a small poetry magazine, XUL,
published its first issue.  The name of the magazine alludes to Xul Solar,
the experimental artist and poet  who was such an influence in Jorge Luis
Borges' work. In a general sense XUL was motivated, as were others' 
publications then, toward (what in retrospective we call) cultural 
resistance.  
<p>
At the time this resistance was less a heroic attitude than a way of 
survival.  It was a resistance against censorship and the holocaust 
of thousands of people as well as a discussion about the impossibility 
of representation in a seamless web that avoided the split between 
politics and formal experimentation.  The magazine also brought into 
question some of the concerns (a revision of the discussions between 
colloquialism and experimentalism, between social realism and formalism,
among others) that the 70's have seen appropriated by the novel, while 
questioning the material and form in which it was presented. 
<p>
The magazine went against the general trend of expressing sympathy
toward the political agenda of the victims: thousands of which became
"missing" or ended up in concentration camps located in the outskirts of
major cities. XUL's refusal to align itself with the political platform of
the victims, in many cases a combination in different dosages of
nationalism and marxism, made room within the magazine for the inclusion
of different theoretical approaches, none of which could claim to be 
representative of the publication as a whole. 
<p>
XUL also resisted the, then, strong tendency to polarization, and developed
as a response, a form of commentary that was specific to poetry and
linguistics and that didn't rely on sociological analysis to think and
write about Argentine culture.  Its editor, Jorge Santiago Perednik, said
in the editorial for issue #4, August 1982: "XUL's engagement with reality
is contained in its engagement with language; one of the ways of realizing
that engagement is in trying to make legible the use of language in the 
service of coercion and concealment." 
<p>
The translation of some of these poems included, and invited, an open
interpretation, in some cases, with comments from the author, that
original figure of speech.  In other cases the English edition in itself
produces further interpretations of the same texts.  For example, Jorge
Lepore's Argentine edition of his "I feel of no forceps" was  done with 
cutups of the text that were typed on white paper with black ink and 
glued on black fine cardboard, suggesting the neon signs of a political 
and affective unconscious.  This English edition does not reproduce that 
layout, therefore creating different readings of a somewhat different text. 
The poems selected for this issue of RIFT are all part of the "XUL 
Reader: An Anthology of Argentine Experimental Poetry" that will be published
as the collaborative effort of seven translators this coming Fall by 
ROOF Books.
