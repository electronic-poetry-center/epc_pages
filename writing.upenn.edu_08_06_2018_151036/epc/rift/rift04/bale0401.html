<h6>I. Partage of Realities: A Logic of Infra-modal Destinerrance<br>
</h6>

<p>
     Derrida: "the . . . task of the translator--his madness, his<br>
agony, the aporias he confronts--proceeds away from some initial<br>
strangeness, from the gap already opened in the idiom of the<br>
original text." This gap of sense already present in the text of<br>
origin and which determines the different aporias of translating--<br>
this is part of what I'd like to call "partage of realities", the<br>
sharing of a binding division of meaning and sense--a crucial<br>
compromise that can be found in the piece translated, complicated<br>
reflection of the relation between the act of translating and the<br>
singular idiocy the translator brings to the task--and permanent<br>
sign of the semantic/phonic discontinuities between languages. <br>

<p>
     What is it then the madness that binds me to this task.<br>

<p>
     In translating my first instinct--my first gesture--is one<br>
of pleasure--the pleasure of playing a stammering game of<br>
language in the moulding and sinking (the untranslatable<br>
"fondersi e affondarsi") of each single syllable into its new<br>
sense--in the rounding and singing of each preposition into a new<br>
tongue of fusion in which each respective language meets the<br>
other transcending its internal and external boundaries.<br>

<p>
     This is the logic of infra-modal translation--a modality<br>
marked by a movement of destinerrance (a term I borrow from John<br>
P. Leavey)--a semantic and phonetic errancy sustained as if by<br>
its destination.<br>

<p>
     Destinerrance (errancy <b>as</b> destination and errancy <b>of</b><br>
destination) is the nomadic search for a third sense between two<br>
languages--a sense that finally floats away, in the translated<br>
piece, as Benjamin's vessel, indifferently adrift between two<br>
seas.<br>

<p>
     Indifferent to--yet belonging to--both languages, the sense<br>
of the translation responds to the singular category of<br>
"whatever" (LAT.: quod libet ITAL.: qualunque)--whereas the<br>
"common form" engendered by the "idiocy" of the "whatever" would<br>
thus be the finished translation. Agamben:<br>
<pre>
     It is from the hundred idiosyncracies that characterize
     my way of writing the letter P or of pronouncing this
     phoneme that its common form is engendered. Common and
     proper, genus and individual are only two slopes
     dropping down from either side of the watershed of
     <i>whatever</i> . . . and precisely this is the <i>idiocy</i>, in
     other words, the singularity of the whatever.


</pre>
<h6>II. Nanni Balestrini's <i>Ipocalisse</i><br>
</h6>
<p>
     Working with Martin Spinelli on the use of pronouns and<br>
monosyllabic prepositions in Balestrini's <i>Ipocalisse</i> --I've been<br>
often reminded of Lacoue-Labarthe's words on the work of<br>
translation, consisting, as he says, in "repeating the unuttered<br>
of . . . [the] text's very utterance". Indeed in translating these<br>
infra-modal sonnets we confronted a poetics that creates<br>
unuttered utterances, a poetics that--cutting or breaking the<br>
sentence up in its minutest components (lexemes, morphemes,<br>
syllables, phonemes)--leaves the individual pieces loose in the<br>
text, free agencies of meaning on the brink of the line.<br>

<p>
     Such concrete operations of "cutting", eating away, eroding<br>
the grounds of ordinary--full--signification, are characteristic<br>
of much of Nanni Balestrini's poetry, but in _Ipocalisse_ the<br>
research of the sense of each line against the obtuse force of<br>
ordinary sentences constructs a lyrical universe that bears the<br>
fragile fascination of a surreal fairy tale--a story of imaginary<br>
leaps outside the boundaries of the given.<br>
