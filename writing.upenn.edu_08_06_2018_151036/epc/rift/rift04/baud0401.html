<h3>Translations by Robert Anbian</h3>
<p>
<h3><a name="death">DEATH</a> OF THE POOR</h3>

<p>

It is Death which consoles, alas! and Death which makes us live;<br>
It is the goal of life, and the only hope,<br>
which rises like an elixir to our heads and intoxicates us,<br>
and gives us enough heart to walk until evening;<br>

<p>

Through the storm and snow, the hoarfrost,<br>
it is the quivering splendor on our black horizon;<br>
It is the famous hotel written of in the book,<br>
where one can eat, and sleep, and sit down;<br>

<p>

It is an angel who holds sleep in its magnetic fingers,<br>
and the gift of ecstatic dreams, and who makes up <br>
the bed of the poor and the naked.<br>

<p>

It is the poor man's purse, and his old country,<br>
glory of the gods and mystical granary,<br>
it is the portico leading to unknown <a href="baud0401.html#lame">Skies!</a><br>

<h3><a name="wine">WINE</a> OF THE LOVERS</h3><br>

<p>

Today space itself is splendid!<br>
Without a bit, without spurs, without reins,<br>
we ride off mounted on wine<br>
toward an enchanted and godlike sky!<br>

<p>

Like two angels suffering<br>
an implacable tropic fever,<br>
we follow through the blue crystal<br>
that is morning the distant mirage!<br>

<p>

Indolently balanced on the wing<br>
of an intelligent whirlwind,<br>
in a parallel delirium,<br>

<p>

Floating side by side, Sister,<br>
we flee with neither repose nor respite<br>
toward the paradise of my <a href="baud0401.html#leaving">dreams!</a><br>
 <br>

<p>

<h3><a name="jewels">THE</a> JEWELS</h3><br>

<p>

The beloved was naked, and knowing my heart,<br>
had retained only her vibrant jewels,<br>
whose pageantry gave to her a rich and conquering air<br>
such as belonged, on langorous days, to Moorish concubines.<br>

<p>

This world radiant of metal and rock<br>
ravishes me, and when its bright<br>
and mocking noise leaps in dance, I madly love<br>
those things in which sound is mixed with light.<br>

<p>

She lay thus, abandoned to love,<br>
and from the height of the couch, smiled<br>
carelessly at my ardor that rose, deep and fragrant as the sea,<br>
mounting toward her as toward a pale cliff.<br>

<p>

Eyeing me like a tamed tiger,<br>
she posed with a vague and dreamy air,<br>
and candor, being joined to shamelessness, <br>
gave fresh charm to all her metamorphoses.<br>

<p>

Polished with oil, undulant like a swan,<br>
arm and leg, thigh and loins<br>
passed before my serene and clairvoyant eyes;<br>
while her belly and breasts, fruits of my vine,<br>

<p>

Hovered, more seductive than Fallen Angels,<br>
to trouble the repose in which my soul lay,<br>
and to lure it from the crystal rock where,<br>
calm and solitary, it had been enthroned.<br>

<p>

I thought I saw the hips of Antiope<br>
joined by a new design to a boyish torso,<br>
so that her figure thrust forth its pelvis--<br>
how superb the rouge on this brown and tawny complexion!<br>

<p>

--The lamp had resigned itself to dying.<br>
The hearth alone illuminated the room,<br>
and each time it heaved forth a flaming sigh,<br>
flooded her amber skin with <a href="baud0401.html#libbi">blood!</a><br>

<p>

(from "Fleurs du Mal" one of 6 poems banned by French censors in 1857)<br>

<h3>THE <a name="setting">SETTING</a> OF THE ROMANTIC SUN</h3><br>

<p>

How beautiful the sun when it rises up fresh,<br>
hurling at us its explosive good morning!<br>
--How fortunate the one who can still lovingly salute<br>
its setting, more glorious than a dream!<br>

<p>

I remember! I saw everything--flower, spring, furrow--<br>
swoon under its eye, throbbing like a heart . . .<br>
--We ran toward the horizon, already late, running faster,<br>
trying to catch one last oblique ray!<br>

<p>

But I chased in vain this god who retreats;<br>
Night, irresistible night, established its empire,<br>
black, humid, fatal, filled with shudders;<br>

<p>

Smell of the tomb in the swirling dark,<br>
and my timid foot bruising, at the edge of the swamp,<br>
hidden toads and cold <a href="baud0401.html#lack">snails</a>...<br>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3><a name="meditation">MEDITATION</a></h3><br>

<p>

Be wise, my Pain, and clam yourself.<br>
You were craving dusk, here it is, coming down:<br>
an atmosphere of ash envelops the town,<br>
bringing to some peace, to others their fears.<br>

<p>

While of mortals the vile multitude,<br>
under the lashings of Pleasure, that hangman without mercy,<br>
goes gathering remorse in the servile holiday,<br>
give me, my Pain, your hand; come this way,<br>

<p>

Far from all of them. Look at the dead Years leaning<br>
in old-fashioned robes out of the balconies of the sky;<br>
From the bottom of the sea, a smiling Regret rises:<br>

<p>

The dying Sun slumbers under an arch,<br>
and with her long shroud trailing out of the East,<br>
listen, dear one, listen to the fragrant night<a href="baud0401.html#recoil"> walking.</a><br>
