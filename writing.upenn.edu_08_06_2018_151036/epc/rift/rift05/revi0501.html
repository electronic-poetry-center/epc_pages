In early 1992, I went to see John Cage read on a Sunday at a
small church in New York City.  He read for 45 minutes to an
audience of maybe 20 people; the room held more, but there
were many empty seats.  I felt fortunate to be at this
event--an intimate gathering with one of the three or four
major 20th-century cultural figures before me.  Although at
this point Cage was considered "classical" ("classical"
meaning that which has been classified--Gertrude Stein), he
still did many of these small gigs when the opportunity
arose. I looked around again--I saw about me a withering,
aging congregation, albeit faithful, who came to hear Cage
preach.  Born in 1961, I must have been the youngest in the
room.  
<p>
On the way home, I began to think about what I had just
seen.  His presence, words, and manner all impressed me. 
His lecture had a compelling open, ethical underpinning that
seemed particularly timely.  I couldn't help but wonder, why
did Cage no longer have the cultural power and pull that he
had in his heyday of the 1960's and 1970's? Twenty-five
years ago, thousands flocked to his concerts (the first
Musicircus in 1969 was attended by over two thousand
people), and he was regarded somewhat as a wizened older
guru (both in the "art" sense and as a Pop culture icon) to
the seething youth culture.  One need only look at the books
produced at the time on Cage to see his enormous sway. 
Slowly though, the country changed.  After the Vietnam War
and Watergate, the mood of the nation's youth shifted away
from the utopian/radical possibilities in both politics and
culture and moved toward a more self-centered materialism. 
As the 70s wore on, Cage seemed to be increasingly
marginalized (not, of course by his own doing) as a
functioning radical thinker and began the transformation
into a museum relic.  He was now an important, historical
artifact, for whom  great crowds would appear at sanctioned
museum events, see a piece of  living history, and go home.
<P>
However, Cage himself never softened.  The culture might
have moved on, but he kept on his radical edge, continuing
his revolution in a quiet way for those who cared not only
to listen, but to act on and live by his words. Through the
1980s, Cage's influence was felt in the  underground,
influencing many of the more interesting cultural movements
of that decade--the birth of indy rock, the renewal of
Conceptual Art, and the rise of Language Poetry.  Many of
these artists studied Cage in the 60s and 70s and went on to
synthesize newer aesthetic/cultural concerns with older
Cageian ideals.  While the 80s played out in the media with
Wall Street Yuppies and decadent consumerists grabbing the
spotlight, many of us spent time on the edge of the culture,
sowing the seeds for the more politically  charged times in
which we now live.
<P>
Given their timeliness, I thought that Cage's social and
ethical ideals would have been embraced by an emerging
politic.  But I was wrong.  As I looked around me, I saw the
rise of multiculturalism and political
correctness--initially not bad ideas at all--but as the
dialogue deepened, these movements seemed to embrace
separation and closure, a single-mindedly "correct" meaning
opposed to Cageian ideas of open inclusiveness ("Here Comes
Everybody" and lack of center).  I finally had to ask
myself, what could Cage possibly mean to my generation?
<P>
When I got home, I pulled out all of my books about and by
Cage.  I looked at the copyright dates--1961, 1965, 1967,
1971, 1975, 1976, 1981, and 1992. Ah! 1992! David Revill's
biography of John Cage,  _The Roaring Silence_ had just come
out.  Perhaps in some way this book could answer my question
and place Cage in a contemporary light.  However, the
problem was that this book could have been written in 1966. 
Shrouded in reverence and privacy, we were only allowed a
certain view of this approachable genius.  And if we didn't
obey the code, there was a certain wrath to bear; Cage was
approachable yet all approached with caution.  I have read
that when John laughed, everyone laughed--such was his
power.  Certain subjects were taboo.  In Revill's book, the
paragraph that deals with Cage's homosexuality is closed:
<p>
"The imminent breakup with Xenia was not only the loss of
one relationship, an important one, but of a sexual
orientation and an identity.  The catalyst can be seen, with
hindsight, as Merce Cunningham; he and Cage would become
partners in the personal as well as artistic sense.  Exactly
what happened is not clear and not important.  It is not
clear because the protagonists have kept the matter private
(indeed, one young speaker at a conference at Stanford
University in 1992 was censured by the chairman for
mentioning Cage's homosexuality "because" Cage does not). 
The details are not important given the aims of this book;
all that is important is that a crisis of a marriage and a
sexual orientation occurred, and Cage's life-decisions, work
and thought need to be placed within that context."
<p>
Revill never mentions the subject again.  This type of
veiled biography seemed irresponsible and unthinkable in
1992.  How could Revill keep silent about such a subject in
the middle of the AIDS crisis after so much work had been
done to dismantle thick closet walls over the previous ten
years, not to mention the  heated discussion that had been
raging surrounding the issues of gender and identity?  This
was just one of many ways in which his book just did not
seem up to date.
<P>
How different this is in comparison to Thomas Hines' essay
"Not Yet Cage" in the new _Composed In America_.  Hines
reports a conversation with Cage where he reveals his
favorite cruising spot in Los Angeles in the early 1930's!!
"Contact with the rest of society was through (cruising) the
parks," (Cage) remembered.  "For me it was Santa Monica
along the Palisades." Wow! Now that's more like it!  Hines'
acute political, temporal, and cultural awareness in this
essay makes it quite clear that he would refuse to treat the
subject as taboo.  This appears to me to be an open and
contemporary approach to biography.
<P>
Or how about Joan Retallack's appendix essay "Revisions to
Overpopulation and Art"?  This is a truly amazing document
telling how Cage, upon having been made aware of the
patriarchal and male dominated language in his mesostics,
went and revised them!  For example:
<pre>

Line 126         
     original: or should he Put himself aside         
     revised: or should artists be Put aside
     
or Line 592         
     original: by mAn         
     revised: by humAn beings

or Line 595              
     original: which man invents sO that         
     revised: which are invented sO that

</pre>
Here is a remarkable instance of the "protagonist" himself
adjusting his own agenda to move with the times.  The
appendix opens with the statement "That John Cage was open
to criticism of his work until the end of his life will
surprise no one who knew him.  In this sense he was
experimental in a way that scientists would
recognize--exploring the unnoticed and the new while testing
his conceptual framework against what he regarded as
important "reality principles." He wanted his work to have
useful consequences in the world and it couldn't have that
if it was somehow off-base, inappropriate, irrelevant."
Cage's actions and this statement suggest to me that it was
not Cage who left, but the general population who veered off
the utopian ethical pathway.  I was beginning to get an
answer to my question.
<P>
I next turned to Gordana P.  Crnkovic's essay "Utopian
America and The Language of Silence," which presents a
fascinating idea.  She begins her essay discussing a visit
to Prague during the wane of Communism.  There, she and a
friend created a utopian view of America that was based in
opposition to whatever information was officially being
given by the government.  Hence, she idealized America as a
horizontal social structure in direct opposition to Eastern
Europe's verticality.  She got a hold of John Cage's
_Silence_ and in it found her "Utopian America," "one able
to acknowledge the validity of each of the numerous, unfixed
centers of society."  She readily admits that this utopian
notion had no correspondence to the "real" America but as
there was no impartial Western information available, these
sorts of utopian fantasy constructions were evidently
commonplace.
<P>
She spends the rest of the essay showing examples of Cage's
writing that support, both in theory and practice, her
"Utopian America."  It is indeed a language foreign to the
ideological and political concerns of late Communism; the
vocabulary includes such ideas as the language of question,
the language of self-alteration, and open multi-directional
language working against closure.
<P>
All very nice, I thought to myself, but this is dated
material--the collapse of Communism happened over 5 years
ago and a new set of problems, equally repugnant and
vertical, had risen--raw-boned Capitalism.  And then it
struck me--it was a trade of one set of verticality for
another, Communism for Capitalism.  The "Utopian America"
that Crnkovic fantasized about remains unrealized, both here
and in Europe--and as late Capitalism continues to spread
like wildfire around the globe, notions of horizontality
seem more necessary than ever.   However, utopian thinking
alone does not seem to cut it here.  Crnkovic, as well as
the rest of the authors in this book, seem to want action. 
How does she propose this will happen? The answer comes at
the very end of the essay where she discusses the "reality
factor" in any Cage performance.  Crnkovic declares
(bravely, I might add) that Cage himself is a vertical
structure--after all, someone has to invent the language of
freedom and set the system in motion. She repeatedly uses
the notion of "materialism" in regard to Cage, as if 
practice is the real way to cut through the layers and
layers of useless ideology  and propaganda.  So, once again,
I found myself pleased with the notion of action and
usefulness--timely and important concerns for a younger
generation.
<p>
Funny things happen to a person after they die--suddenly
it's as if the closet doors are permitted to be opened and
all sorts of repressed and hidden things come tumbling out. 
Hence, another important aspect of the book: it is the first
to come out on Cage since his death and in this respect
alone it's remarkable because we are able to see the
composer in a fully dimensional form that was witheld while
he still lived.  This is the case  with Marjorie Perloff's
contribution "A duchamp unto myself", which deals with 
Cage's sublimated and repressed desire for Marcel Duchamp
and Jann Pasler's "Inventing a Tradition: Cage's
"Composition in Retrospect", which discusses  Cage's
rewriting of his own history.  These are outrageous essays,
really.  In the case of Perloff, I never could envision
anyone positing such a theory while Cage was alive. It's
truly juicy.
<P>
Perloff deals with issues of identity and desire, both
public and private. She also entertains the very pertinent
notion of one's image and the means by which one manipulates
and controls the public perception of that image. And what
concern could be more up-to-the-minute than one's notion of
one's "media-self"?
<P>
Cage, as Pasler tells us, was a master in shaping our
perception of him. So was Duchamp.  As it turns out, they
did it in very different ways-- Duchamp was fleshy French
eroticism, and Cage was WASPy American repression.  Perloff
quotes Duchamp discussing erotica as "a thing that everybody
understands . . . to be able to reveal them (erotic things),
and place them at everyone's  disposal--I think that this is
important because it's the basis of everything, and no one
talks about it." It's a funny contrast to Cage, who
celebrated the wonder and awareness of one's daily life but
repressed the thing which is "the basis of everything."
<p>
Perloff's thesis is that there was an erotic and sexual side
to Duchamp's work that Cage could never assimilate.  She
states "Ironically, the real appeal of Duchamp for Cage ('I
love him and he ...  changed my life') may have had less to
do with Marcel's work than with his enticing presence--the
exotic image of the man smiling enigmatically over the
chessboard or appearing in drag as Rrose Selavy." This
brings the subject around to image control and 
manipulation.  Perloff and Pasler make me aware in these
essays that Cage controlled his public image to the same
extent as Andy Warhol.  One of the things that makes Cage so
relevant to us is his Media-savvy.  Cage not only used
electronic media in his work but also had a sense very early
on about how to use Media to his advantage (his close
affiliation with Marshall McLuhan was no coincidence). 
Perloff discusses Cage's rewriting of his own and Duchamp's
history (through the mesostic work "Alphabet") to have us
see Cage as Cage wanted us to see him.  Cage was Warholian
in this way but in my opinion (and many will surely disagree
with me), Cage was sacrificing/altering his ego in order to
show us an alternative way to live and be in the world,
whereas Warhol was complicit with the economic and ethical
systems of Capitalism.  So in a way, Cage's media
manipulation was forgivable--showing us a higher
good--whereas Warhol's manipulation showed us a mirror of
our ugly selves and seemed offer no alternative.
<p>
<u>Composed In America</u> centers around a Cage Musicircus held
at Stanford University in 1992, beautifully described by
Charles Junkerman in the opening "nEw / foRms of living
together": The Model of the Musicircus." Junkerman tells us
that the Musicircus is a model that envisions a utopian
possibility for humanity.  It involves a horizontal,
decentered, non-judgmental community effort which includes
all who wish to partake. Cage's main thrust in the
Musicircus is that one musician might stop trying to play in
time with the other musicians around him/her in order to be
able to function as an interdependent, non-interfering
entity.  This is the opposite approach to Western music
where an orchestra, say, is supposed to function like a well
unified machine.  Awareness and openness is required of the
individual performers, allowing others to perform in a
parallel manner that  promotes less ego-dependence and
ultimately freedom. It is a practical working model of (to
use Herbert Lindenberger's term) "regulated anarchy".  And
*working* is the key here.  This book seems  to say that
theory alone is not good enough--theory must then be put to
task  through realization.  Realization of theory in many
cases is extremely  experimental and it takes an open-minded
culture to allow the experiment and  to accept the results
as proof.  _Composed In America_ insists on getting its
hands dirty.  It tests theories again and again and accepts
them only if they prove to be workable.  This is the
pragmatism of Cage--the son of an inventor and himself "an
inventor of genius", he favored a pragmatic "American" model
of thinking, hence  the call to action.  _Composed In
America_ picks up this thread and time and  again on its
pages, theory is put into practice.
<p>
The final essay here is "Poethics of a Complex Realism" by
Joan Retallack and note the word *realism* in the title. 
Retallack begins her essay with an invocation of American
Pragmatist John Dewey's "Art As Experience" and launches
into a long discussion of the idea of weather as it relates
to the ideas of John Cage.  Cage said that he wanted his
music to be like the weather--unpredictable,
omnidirectional, impermanent, and always changing--a complex
system that parallels the conditions of our daily life. He
did several works involving the weather, modeling his ideas
after nature (again, a tip of the hat to American
Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau), which are described
here.  Retallack takes the word play of weather/whether and
sets up a correspondence between the physical (realized) and
the theoretical (unrealized).  She then posits an ethic
based on the principle  of weather/whether.  Imagine, she
says, a culture sophisticated and open enough to be able to
accept difference and otherness, a culture that rejects the
oversimplified media response of black/white, yes/no, a
culture that embraces complexity and contradiction--a
"breathable" culture.  And it is here that the book
brilliantly dovetails with the multicultural attitudes
sweeping the country today.  Cage stands in opposition to
the reductive and closed ideas that multiculturalism has
come to stand for.  While multiculturalism plays by the
media-supplied dualistic rules, Cage seems to dump the idea
of rules altogether and instead celebrates the idea of
difference and unpredictability as a prerequisite to
understanding and accepting the difficulties inherent in a
pluralistic culture.  It appeals to this reader as  the path
of least resistance and being based in action, seems
entirely workable.  The multicultural debate has made many
people aware of the issues, but it stands in theory only and
lacks the kind of pragmatism and functionality that could
lead to real change as prescribed here.
<p>
The remainder of the book for me is like the Cageian
experience of mushroom hunting in the forest.  You might go
out looking for one thing and yet along the way stumble
across something you could never imagined.  Cage taught us
to appreciate and enjoy these finds as much as the trove we
initially set out to look for.  The other essays scattered
throughout the book covers a fascinating variety of topics
on specific fields and look at Cage through the lens of
those realms.  There are essays on Cage and ethical theory, 
science, opera, and the global.
<p>
These contributions function in letting us see more angles
of John Cage than we ever could have imagined.  For example,
I never have read ethical theory, but I quickly found myself
engrossed in Gerald L.  Bruns' article "Poethics: John Cage
and Stanley Clavell at the Crossroads of Ethical Theory." 
Cage provides a window for me to enter into a dialogue that
was previously unbeknownst to me.  Another case is Herbert
Lindenberger's essay on Cage's Europeras "Regulated
Anarchy."  This is a brilliant essay by a man who obviously
knows his field--it is lively and entertaining and I can't
help but think how appropriate it might be in a book devoted
specifically to opera--it will really shake up readers who
are traditional opera lovers.  Like traveling along the
forest path in search of mushrooms, _Composed In America_ 
gently twists and turns as it goes along its way, but the
reader should be warned that there is one patch of
quicksand: Daniel Herwitz' "John Cage's Approach To The
Global."  This essay starts out lively but quickly
disintegrates in a deadly dull, line by line reading of a
mesostic that becomes swamped in a thick stew of sleepy
theory.  It is the only essay in the book where theory takes
precedence over practice and the results are languidly
stultifying .
<p>
After reading _Composed In America,_ I went to put it on the
shelf with all my other books on Cage.  Deciding where it
should go, I realized that "Composed In America" is
approximately the same size and shape of all of Cage's books
published by Wesleyan.  Is this any coincidence? Probably
not. This is a savvy book, one that has one eye on the past
and one eye on the future.  "Composed In America" is the
book on Cage we've been thirsting for--finally, a book that
moves John Cage squarely into the 90s and sheds much needed
light on the relevancy of his thought for the current
generation.  In doing so it performs a dual function--it
allows us to see the man as he has never been seen before
and it sets a radical agenda for the propagation of his
ideas after his death and far into the future.

Okay, well the "hi pts" for me were as follows:

I agree with Dodie Bellamy that Susan Howe stole
the show during the one long reading with 22
poets.  She stood on tiptoes and read & made
everyone else seem half baked, no, pallid.  Well
actually I enjoyed some other readings quite a
bit-incl. Deanna Ferguson, Dorothy Trujillo Lusk,
and other Canadian poets new to me.  Pierre
Joris's camel poem sure pleased the crowd - was it
camels or horses?  Steve McCaffery is a God. 
Susan Clark gave a very emotional, moving reading,
and Lisa Robertson is becoming the new updated
Elizabeth Smart.  I had heard Karen Mac Cormack
here in San Francisco before, but now she is even
better, understated, in control, dignified, a
dynamo too.

Joanne Kyger read a piece about seeing Quan
Yin-the Buddhist goddess-or whatever-and Dodie
interviewed her in the women's "washroom" asking
her if she really saw Quan Yin and JK said, "Yes,
but you have to be on the right substance."

Gosh, I seem to be praising all these women, well,
that's me to a T. I didn't even mention Anne
Waldman yet, a show all to herself . . . And what
about that Rachel Blau Du Plessis!  Rachel,
"Drafts" 24 has opened up to a new theatricality &
largeness of expression and scope that's just
marvelous.

Several have noted how Robin was in attendance
during every event-for 4 days, from 9:30 a.m. till
past midnight.  Needless to say I didn't match his
record & there were several panels I skipped or
missed.  I don't have his stamina-however maybe if
it was all about me I would have attended it all
too.  His reading which climaxed the whole affair
was outstanding, he read "Exody," "Even on
Sunday," the new poem "Nomad" and another poem
that's in progress, very much so.  Great
starpower!  Speaking of which, I have a new dream
man, Canadian poet & novelist Michael Ondaatje. 
We had heard that he was the sexiest writer in
Canada, which is not quite the case close up, but
nevertheless he has piercing blue eyes & this
wonderful accent I could listen to for a week on
end.  Dodie spotted him first but I wasn't far
behind.  After that, all he had to do was open his
mouth or eyes and we were transfixed - like two
American rabbits caught in the headlights of an
oncoming car.  Duh.  A genius as far as I'm
concerned.  Dodie was quite jealous when she
overheard M.O. telling Catriona Strang that she
was brilliant.

Okay, but Catriona was brilliant; the performance
she gave with Francois Houle, the avant-garde
clarinetist, playing 2 clarinets at once at times,
while Catriona barked out syllables, words, gritty
demanding sentences, around the letters "R" and
"B" made a sensation at the Festival Opening. 
Charles Bernstein opened the "opening" with a very
smart witty talk that hit the right notes,
including a rapidfire mention of all the groups
Robin has been associated with (Boston Gang,
Vancouver poets, SF Renaissance, New American
poets, Berkeley Renaissance) then reminding us
that he has been all these things and more and
none.

The organizers worked like dogs.  I felt sorry for
them but they did not seem to be feeling sorry for
themselves.  Bravo to all!  I saw most of Charles
Watts and Karen Tallman but everyone seemed
totally together.

I did feel the strange disquieting presence of
Warren Tallman, like a ghost, haunting the whole
conference and the whole city and I kept wondering
what he was making of all this hoopla.

One man called "Robert Hullot-Kentor" gave a fine,
iconoclastic paper, very Adorno-based, basically
saying that there's no point to recovering the
public world, that today there's no public and in
fact no world.

Next door to the Emily Carr School where the
panels were held was a very fine show called "In
Search of Orpheus: Some Bay Area Poets & Painters
1945-65," curated by Scott Watson.  Jess, Tom
Field, Harry Jacobus, Blaser himself, Lyn
Brockway, a bright crayon drawing by Spicer, etc.,
etc, most of the work from Blaser's own
collection. Here the work of Fran Herndon shone
like a revelation.  Here were the lithographs she
did for Spicer's book The Heads of the Town up to
the Aether, and the larger sports-themed collages
you can see reproduced in Jim Herndon's book
"Everything as Expected."  Fran Herndon was in
Vancouver attending the conference in person &
received a tremendous ovation when picked out of
the audience and introduced.  It's about time such
a talented artist began receiving the recognition
due her. So to see it all happening before one's
eyes was an incredible lift.

Kristin Prevallet made a stir with her slide
presentation, during the first panel,
"Companions," outlining the life & work of the
late Helen Adam.  Prevallet's research into the
Adam papers at the SUNY Buffalo Poetry Collection
showed us all for the first time the extent and
power of Adam's greatness as a poet & writer.  And
artist too, for Prevallet was able to bring out of
the archives several-eight or nine?-of Helen
Adam's unique collage-based works, which were
shown in the Scott Gallery as part of the Orpheus
show-in fact it's hard to figure how incomplete
the show would have been without them.  For
bibliophiles-the appearance of a dozen or so
copies of Helen Adam's rare White Rabbit book "The
Queen o' Crow's Castle" (1958) ill. by Jess-on the
book table-for sale-and only $15.00 (Canadian)
apiece-would have made you swoon!  Try and get one
in San Francisco for less than $100.00
(American)-and these were white as snow, no trace
of fading or foxing-MINT!

In fact the book table-book section (organized by
Vancouver's Black Sheep Books) was totally
tempting & I must have spent, oh, God, I don't
even want to remember.

I had fun having lunch with Joanne Kyger, Dora
FitzGerald, George Stanley and Fran Herndon one
sunny afternoon & then all of them sparking each
other to more and more remembrances of Spicer
faster than I could take it all in . . .  and
introducing them to Kristen so that they could
tell her all about Helen Adam . . .  I had this
eerie feeling of history right in my hands.

There could have been another wonderful reading
just culled from those who were there in the
audience, quite a swell crowd including Lee Ann
Brown, Elizabeth Willis, Erin Moure, Myung Mi Kim,
Kevin Magee, Laynie Browne, Matthew Stadler, Colin
Smith, etc., etc.

I felt safe going up to Vancouver because, with
the help of so many pals, I had secured quite a
number of "tributes" to Robin from those who could
not attend.  With those in my attache case I felt
like a king.  Ellen Tallman & I got to read them
out loud at the dinner. Some of them were from
people on this Poetics List, and I will be writing
to you privately, each of you, to thank you at
length, but for now let me close by thanking you
all in toto: Giorgio Agamben, Don Allen, Bruce
Andrews, James Broughton, Cid Corman, Robert
Creeley, Samuel R. Delany, Allen Ginsberg, Robert
Glu"ck, Barbara Guest, Thom Gunn, Lyn Hejinian,
Jess, Robert Kelly, Gerrit Lansing, Denise
Levertov, Jackson Mac Low, Bob Perelman, Avital
Ronell, Claude Royet-Journoud, Ron Silliman and
I'm leaving 1 or 2 out.

	THE "DIGITAL REVOLUTION" HAS SOME INTELLIGENT OFFSPRING.
Though the most interesting developments in electronic poetry will
occur, in my opinion, through a network sensibility (visit the 
<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc"> Electronic Poetry Center</a> 
via the Internet for a view into the possibilities of "connectivity")
this CD-ROM suggests some immediate and interesting possibilities.
<p>
	That this is a commercial product makes the poets chosen quite
surprising. The voyager CD-ROM series, displayed in a number of stores
nationally in flashy carousels, contains titles such as "Baseball's
Greatest Hits" and "People: Twenty Years of Pop Culture" as well as
interesting items such as "Maus" and "Ephemeral Films." The series by
no means pretends any specialization in poetry. However this company's
one contemporary poetry product, at this writing, contains a range of
interesting poets including Ted Berrigan, Robert Creeley, Alan
Ginsberg, Jim Carroll, Anne Waldman, and Jim Cage.
<p>
	In all, Poetry in Motion offers the work of some two dozen
poets. Using the disk involves choosing from the author list. When you
select an entry for viewing, you are presented with an opening screen
split into three sections: a text of the poet, a screen with the poet
reading, and, in most cases, an interview screen. Clicking on the
"reading" screen starts a video clip in motion and the poem in the
text panel scrolls as the poem is read. (This text screen actually
offers the choice of two versions of the text: "As Performed" and "As
Published." The poem will scroll with the reading if the "As
Performed" box is checked.) If you click on the interview screen, a
brief clip of the poet discussing poetics will play.
<p>
	The disk is tremendous as a sampler, especially for those who
teach or for those who don't have ready access to readings. Who could
ever read the printed text of Waldman and witness the physical energy
there? Or the careful pacing of Creeley? (Ginsberg and Burroughs are
exceptions somewhat, since both turn up more regularly in the mass
media.) Berrigan is a particular treat, for the pacing of the poem
read, of course, but also for Berrigan's movements, gestures, his
physical approach to the literary "event."
<p>
	The disk is also a rare exception in that a great deal of
effort seems to have been put into layout and the graphical
presentation of screens; it is quite a pleasure to move through its
menus.
<p>
	Notwithstanding the quality of the poets presented, of
greatest interest is Poetry in Motion's approach to presenting the
"word." The mix between performance and interview clips and the
presentation of the dual nature of a poem as published and as it takes
place in public is engaging. Quite a pleasurable experience bounded,
interestingly, only by the medium itself: since video takes up so much
disk space and emphasis is given to performances, interview clips tend
to be quite short. In fact, there is NOT a lot of material here, each
poet basically reading one poem. The CD actually does not compare to
say, a good-sized anthology in breadth or variety.
<p>
	The lack of depth in such a well-edited project makes one
wonder if a multi-media CD-ROM product, though presenting
well-selected material portably and in an engaging manner, must
ultimately suffer from the insularity and limitations its own format
imposes. All told however, it's a treat to see technology meet poetry
in such a satisfactory fashion.
