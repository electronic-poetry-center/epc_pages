SEE-SAW


Right rose was left down of doves;
Lend a hand, swinging up from wet marsh.
Toll heard, runs to house rapidly on
tiny feet, perched, chasing door in range
and gobbles dangerous hot soup, au jus.

Ukulele strummings in spheres as pit
of stomache glazes down cones of time,
folding like paper hats for clowns and
green as mold shaken from hurling roc;
Or, was that a bazookie swinging rounds.

Will be gleefully extolling ventures,
glasses missing from rotted nose.
Straw boy manages to reason spin and
fur's fruit is rugged lain bare;
swine calves hours past centipede semi.

Thrust, flaps, seperates, engenders crashing.

CONJUNCTION


	  like subsiding,
a fallen tremor         
strum of inconsequential figure
only posited        forsworn 
	   urban center
	   deaf to the noise of memory
	   autumnal like a fiction 
	   receding, said.
Gone off on a fragment         a place to prop
the garment of failed        
and release        entries.


_____________________________________________

in-twined attention 
and the verdant memory of a slovenly rebus
collapsed metaphor or a barbie doll 
	driving home from work
	over tangled jar-and-hill substance 
	and plucked up twang-notion
in mourning for a dead tune-row,
the camera-flashed country
a particle memory of a collapsible portrait 
	about to sound in its static movement
	the first instance: forgetting how to write

an everyday mess of things wired a VCR dream of communication


______________________________________________

rings with bitter and inability
cut-off enacts     untouched    the physical world
and also in the verbal sense     to lighten
in the letter     just as the sun is rent
soft beginnings     falling in torrents     a lot of questions
an excess of about cleaved into possible reference

to expose depth, flight, cartoon appearance  

why withdraw, encompassing

OF QUISP & MORE

i.

an electric fan sitting on the beach propped up on a giant towel like the
history of the khanate contemplating the litany of unrecorded atrocities
of the sun.

it's been far too long i've been away far too long the seafoam reminds me
of root beer on a dish rag & i cannot recall exactly whatever i was what i
was thinking of b/4 whatever i've since become.  sand i see no longer
requires silicates or any erosive splendor at all & every memory comes w/a
detachable official scorer passing for a snot-nosed proust some bum-wad &
a box of Quisp in the single serving aluminum diner size.

i come from a long line of the pennsylvania dutch phosphate farmers their
fingers circled w/strings.    even the butter staggered about.  the little
things. pomeranians swinging like angry mops from all the willow trees &
the sound of legs snapping in the wind.

in the basement i live in a basement now surrounded by fans of every type
of every size they sound like a helicopter plummeting into a jungle except
that they never stop no not for a second no if they ever did everyone
would know they'd know it there wouldn't be a question from anyone as to
what's going down these fans are more than fans understand these fans are
all that & more yes it's been far too long.

color comes slowly to a face there if indeed color it comes at all.


ii.

the simplicity of it all the beauty of it a wall of outlets w/a surfeit of
backup blades it's no wonder i rarely if ever leave & who can blame me
besides the dehumidifier has & knows well its place in the great chain it
doesn't need the prompting of the blue carrots nor do i. crossword puzzles
the plastic drums full of pepsi w/crickets tied to the water pipes &
dangling down from above they flutter w/the wind so & make but the
smallest of sounds.

a particle board dresser has more resiliency than the buzzards or
osteopaths will allow.  all that i need know can be gleaned from the hands
of a ballplayer a 1915 ballplayer kneeling b/4 a scalded grass trimmer on
an infield littered w/flint.  the rest is so much fluff a paramedic w/out
a war.

it's unsurpassed this delicate symmetry the delicate symmetry of the
electric fan as it sits upon the sand it sits idling by the surf i cover
it w/oil & watch it bronze slowly in the sun me i never had the knack i
wear a large hat like a coolie dreaming of running an expanse of rails
across the atlantic i make it my business to stay inside.

anything is possible however i say this to myself i say it out loud i
practically scream it i do scream it i scream "anything is possible" but
no one seems to notice it no one seems to notice myself though the fan's
receiving a few looks & who can blame them after all it's a fan.

a hilltop is as terrible a thing as a valley is wise.  doors, then, are
necessary.


iii.

"every response, friend, precipitates another."

the typical bus driver prattle it reminds me of sunday mornings of little
round top it reminds me of henry the drunk.

fans were treated w/respect then were accorded their proper place the
position due them in every hardware store in a full section of sears you'd
find them--waiting--a tug at the every sleeve.

The Perma-Cool 3000.  Encore's Ice King.  Frigid Variable Speed Intake &
Exhaust.

names like connie mack's philadelphia athletics or the '27 yankees &
beyond the giants of john mcgraw names that determine as much as they
reveal that lodge somewhere near the brainstem & will not be tooled by
movement or the blunderbuss of the sun.  i don't know which angle is
optimal but a few landmarks are all i need something to backbone me into
another a few facts and a wall of fans another basement a tiny window its
fraction of light. 

iv.

& newspaper kiosks line the beaches in an effort to exert more influence
over the tides.

this too i've never seen b/4 though in retrospect wonder why.

willows anchored to the sea floor.

never am i as far from nor never as near.

	  SUBJUNCTIVES


it's when first i struggled onto this promontory this lack & did not gasp
not fall to bottom when first upon this shelf i realized i'd turned become
the other the opposite of what i'd been there in the network of salt &
froth my eyes no longer eyes the strident from forms a resonant where &
never w/out fear the stinging suspicion of something terribly awry i
should not be here the lack what are questions but want i should be w/the
others in the same w/the opposite i look to & nothing but this other i
this there now here

i cannot measure i have no conversion tables to balance this is not
i recognize only cannot but here somehow is forever i'll be alone distinct
from displaced yes my home i cannot return the terrible journey of will
it's there now i gasp stumbling i back into ache i feel myself i'm
changing the other am weak am blind to what's come b/4 me all that follows
please let none follow none i let them forget

stumbled i've across bones i cannot tell the from were there others b/4
like me others questioning the is & now have not or are these the remains
which could not be born to the lack who gasped who fell when i not i
cannot describe from considered fortunate stumbled across i've bones i'll
keep them the bones my language has but eight arms to describe them i'll
call them not-home i'll fuse them not-home into one hang they'll from me i
believe they've yes forgotten they've i believe this forgotten

so much i cannot the out this of here the colors surrounding i move much
better now i think often i'm learning but how so sure of this how the hook
i hang on i look to the opposite i see no others but above me i cannot
describe hanging some burning strange a beauty w/held me apart yet not i
cannot move from it so the arisen understand but that i'm w/out that no
longer the only


most of what i'll not know or stumble upon i learn i become the more of
what i'm not & will continue i cannot recognize the various others of i
the distant strains of not the pains these changes all progress as does
the hesitant this into that i struggle to see to find others of same but
the any cannot until it turns equal still i stumble i forward until the
was gasps it falls to bottom until this was lands the sea

day all day long i name things i name i give to that a relationship an
order born from need my need a need to convert the what yes the lines
converging as others branch off i hold onto the root my root i fuse w/the
tangling the beautiful symmetry of contrary that i into lines i scratch out
lines all day long i name things i need cannot let go i-need becomes the
thatlisting i into dirt

i'm certain now that others have onto my this i dig through sand to dirt
pick trees i discover i other the random truths they backbone my eyes
somehow others here while i struggled naming alone into one yes i so
certain the sea cannot sand i hoard myself & belly the grasses the odors
of was i will not wash them the fear daylong burning a warning shot
stranger form i

still no contact though pushed of dirt i move now here i walk so & leg
this air a darkened sift of not likewise a too b/4 me i stumble still
though taller somehow choking w/names of not yet i wait i look to the
there of sea not-home around my neck i remember i'll never not i remember
the  sting of salt the froth the gasping that never it  that stopped w/out
me my eyes locked on arisen my eyes red & burning like the hanging beauty
of this home now my here

NIETZSCHE WROTE THAT TRUTH APPROACHES
ON THE LEGS OF A DOVE


the sky a mirror

every mirror a mirage

every mirage a night-watchman.

				In darkenss there are

draftsmen
	drawing without inscriptions
					drawbridges.

	The sky is a beast of pray,
	a burdened breast.

The crossing over comes after the flash of lightening,

the erasure

	of the ermine in the drift of snow,

the disguise of white among whiteness.

				The eremite migrates
				from the mountains
				to streams beside mills.

Mill water now a mirror,
eyes, wet weeds.

MANKIN


Both the army is empty.
If I look at it again I know, both
against, and within a kind of
army. To do that is not
from easy trial.  It's something too that's
mechanised, a pool
to turn at.  It was invented
because of the consulate
and because the realm.  The form of this
is authoritative.  A coin amongst the
most touched of things, often
gathered.  A group is
a state of mind
and a state of mind is a prayer.
This is why since I've joined.

FOUNDATION LOGIC


As far as move
clips forward, cue as
baulk within a makeshift
canal.  A crane, turtle, and
all things could be screened
easily.  Kaori maybe, iron,

you are not part of a religion yourself. Jung not Freud.

with it produces a different work than is produced by someone else using
the I-Ching. Notice that your works are more like each other, than your
I-Ching works are like I-Ching works by other artists. Stockhausen not

vocal sound, and is far superior to even the most modern
apparatus for creating tone-colours". Stockhausen not Zukofsky,
the musical phrase, remember, not the metronome.

The truth of a process makes sense to and among those at the end of the
process, where the transcription of thought on the page is a clean mirror
to both writer and readers, writer as s/he writes, reader as s/he reads;
the book unwritten is the look that speaks volumes between and among such.

<p>

This so rare that most of us do in the name of more, ever more, vocal and
verbal, dropped out of empathy then yanked back, the lack of us in
"you-you" the vocation of study, time out.

<p>

Oscar does not believe that art is being and thought is ugliness. He says
so as in his day was no art and thought. Those who use Freud as if he were
himself as benign and liberational as they do what he did not put sex
against the ban on sex, power against stable.

<p>

Such sects! Lift up hearts, prey on. The dream can only create if sleep is
not for the provision of rest, o day for rest and night for study. Bade
the body. The good faith goads the intellect setting the church of our
agenda which, fulfilled, burns. We digest the stone and break into a jog.

<p>

Dream breathing. Think, your very heart beating is bleeding and the blood
next to come is bleeding into your heart, the oxygen is bleeding to become
blood, the folks with beating blood are beating the air only. Dream wing.

<p>

All every night walk by the venue in their heads where perfect truth of
process plays the energy of creation. All have greater artists than
Shakespeare to meet, but avery eye, don't converse, few attend, few
remember, we are special in knowing we're special not especially.

<p>

The perfect dreamer in all, in each, not a speaking to us all. Few go to
sleep with the energy to mingle. I know I'm not alone in this. Shakespeare
the artist in history, fifty of the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of
years, everyone is Shakespeare.

<p>

The dead can dance. Dreams trot through our excuses, scared to knock such
vital guards. The fear's not explained till the dream's not come back
against twenty such sentries. Step out of the stage and into the tubes.

<p>

Stick to your gun till you blow off your head, walk again on your legs no
one else's, carry your seed as she grows in your arms, out of your pain,
let her, away from your pain. Think well of yourself, use your hands, get
a grip, on the non-carnal gun.

<p>

So many arms, swinging under the noosed throats, the unspoken carried on
so many legs. Like dream life's accidents, vile, we dream nearer and
nearer, the guard hangs in the air, twitching, tapping. We feel bumped
into until, joy, we are alive.

<p>

The ambient never wake up. Like you don't. You begin to ban humour and
alcohol, the mares buck and head for the guards in new hope. Rest is not
it, without truth towards process towards truth.

<p>

If you're still reading, no-one's got anything. Some *should* let thoughts
fester in the mind, process the festering. I know mortally the years from
when I was born, each day the unit of measurement cuts history into
me-sized portions, knowing ledges. I dodder to think the art of it.

<p>

Sophocles mortal braved Freud, now so less winning. The Freud-led walk
through him, more to hurt that if they'd gone by him, on every shelf in
every flame-stricken library? Mind how you go. Excavate Plato, afraid to
go out, for dream research.

<p>

Nothing like life to keep you from dying, the nerves are steel strings,
loud acoustic. Song begins the vibration, words reason the entry, into
society, largely worthy of nothing so clarity!

<p>

Be you once, the harsh heart sooner or timely, a slick into two
dimensions, of prose, this nuisance is losing its once fascination, the
pattern returns to its usual dynamic. Think in the two, drink in the
third, things they don't want to reveal indicate why do you say that.

<p>

I get it. Draw on planes, repairing the prairie, the gasses from the
busses, the hole us. Destroy two to save three. The hurt behind the face
understood yields to surf on the face again.

<p>

The month from a flame that took our collection, from our senses, and
flashed a banner over a dish of a dominant hemisphere, the northern, a cap
with the bill right in front of our eyes. A missable interactive
experience, a miserable sky made it so.

<p>

Is cool holodeck sky? I sensed it cambe back to my name, but a short
therapist circuits the patient, tree dimensional. I'll take my
"clumsiness", I didn't dream "it" up, I ride broken in the bumps of a
world I ought never to have believed was mine only thought. Alive-in
world.

<p>

The process of a sense makes truth to and among those at the head of a
process, where the transcription of truth on the page is a claimed mirror
to both writers and reader, writer as reader as utter; the book unsmitten
is the look that speaks volumes between and among such.

FAVOR


<p>

	What skiller'd nomenclature in passing no more unfortunate
angularities were unkempt or forgiven, without pity the looser
denials were swept aside in no more than that.  What's the day,
anyway, and you skip the rest, moving throughout the same as this
is no mere destiny, but a follower in his own soup, motelling
your own airs are swept away again, no more than icing on the
format of your own toes nailing away is too soon for lessening
the openings in the day.  This is the newer throng, deep within
this as thought itself was no other than a reminder of the newer
flingers.
	A passion in doubt, that's his anchor in the dust, flailing
wedge and hayfield, associated back, perhaps, but nonetheless a
newer sign than the one around your neck.  And in these or other
times, there would be some measurement to collapse them into
their own sentences, foretold within silence as no other was
willing to do so, but carried the day ahead in wooden sighs one
after the other was still another moon descending, sick of your
own crap, you say, but still caught up in a slippery substance
deeper laid on top of the surfaces of your own heart was still a
sensation without definition, yet or not, but the stay made
simpler against them one after the other calming or exploding,
there was the doorway held aside from what you said was another
spill, but laid up, but opened out, here and thus the loopier
scores are folded away, let against hillsides in the moon's
declinations, compunctual or fluttered, this is the time we held
apart for counting or for a nomenclature, it was still held too
firm within the anchors at fold or plasm, skippered from then to
now, it is the pasture in his own psalms which is a sudden
density spelled forward into the morning.
	I'd held too far affirmed within sinks at his holder's vow,
this was not the time to stare at the wall, bucketed down with no
gloom or fruits; it held and swept all others away into the
light, and how his own ships went aside was not too tempers but
another calm.  I held them away at first, but foolers peeled
whisked plenitude, like a monster gallery benign or sustenance,
this plastic bucket cocked afar no hand inside your shirt was
spelled this or that, it held too soon for anyone to make measure
the funnier masks her own shell or fortune led to knocks the
deeper fissure at padded line his blue air beckoned, as "old
fashioned" became more a shirt or covering than flowing ships
were scaled to bottom or doubt, his was the fooler skim, slowing
to gasp of fathom, a denial of the rest was heldto stops, then
shuddered like the leisure class, typing their poems out of
memory, but sent to the end of time like what you forgot, and as
this was no mere mention of doubt within categories, there were
still too many to handle, and then dusks met a sudden shower is
still your only hope in this, uh, melange of shapers.
	I mentioned the rest to what was left, there within a
blanket, narrative response notified you again as fold pealed
away, as color bedded down, but polled them at the doorway in
sentences too calm to be relieved of their own passion, his was
the anchor folded into another peel.  At exclamations met, theirs
was an agreed-upon air, or a plan of action which was labeled and
then left behind you in the dark, beyond notification, but still
held together with spoons and the cake on the plate, carved,
sudden and intrigues me into this or that, it is holding down, he
spoke too slowly to realize.
	Ships were floating out.  But you counted, and let airs
realize a formation of spokes tongue-to-field her own wet spines
leaning out!  I'd made states into their own particular
definitions, but when you heal, there is the answering tides,
slowly clammed up or made into special allowances for what fooled
you the first time a good plot without sensation, but then
leaning toward newer things were let against characters without
assassination; his held, too.
	I'd ship it.  Too lean to mention, but blued out into
forgiveness, there was the teller at the shim, there was the
padded push, noticing nothing wherever you went was soon enough
to crap and leap around on the dusk of your own inventions, and
where his was the cooler peak, I noticed nothing again, and
flooded forward these lesser hours finished.  I'd psychology and
her own shores, skippered within thinking, another looser claim
against attention, shorter here than the mere notice of chance
itslf, one ticket shredded too quickly is your own excuse to what
was heaped.  I'd heard of it before your own speakers, and in the
time of deciding, here was the loader pushing poems up against
the wall, let aside into brown or orange internal pools fructate
or palliate; and what is left would cheer you inner sperm, the
dusk, or his own ankles.
	What'd you do?  It was not, but still I waited again,
noticing nothing again, but still you did it to me, waving slow
arms were held too firm to pour away, too flailing or wasted, a
quick irony was not met but infirm, and totaled firm, this husk,
in her distant finer was the farm, not floored, but realized,
intent, fashion, the manner of the sign, and inner floods pooling
dunkers too rounded.
	The plainer sighs were still your own hedge against
immortality, and catchier phrases were held against you, too.  At
the pooler shim, he pestered aside from no measures were made too
soon from what was left aside, and in no motorships, these pushed
aside and suggested something new.  I supposed a density, but it,
too, held affirmed presences were likened at seeming wedge and
spasm.  I'd heard of the non-narrational, but this was a spasm,
too.  Not something extra thick, but bacon or a letter.  It was
not too soon to realize favoritism among the alphabet, and
skippers at the calm suggestion were not the rule.  What passed
cogitation, this was a newer throng, and let you down without
piety, into other signs the former throng too flustered or
diagonal.  I'd supposed supervision was not really the key.  It'd
shred them one on one, but the lesser demons were kept here. 
Major throngs inside plastic formations.  His lists and lists.
	Your eases, this kept them on track but shuttered.  Her new
breasts were bigger, but still her calm intention was shining,
facelike in forgiveness, but still a hand, but still annual hands
swept you away.  Deep within, there was no balance, there was
another term for this hucking out upon the floor, within silence,
but new to the mats they swept aside.  Even "something out of
nothing" was still a simpler rule to obey than one to make it in
the evening, on the floor, in haste or short of breath.  This was
a hacker's dream, pinted-out but lacquer.
	A push aside, a forester at coat and deal.  Held at calm,
but not too soon went the distance on what was laid up for the
winner.  Associative realms yield into nothing unfamiliar, but
sweatshirts.
	Decorative and resistance, there's the deal.  What'd stars
no plasm folded, deeper within another calm, there was water on
the nearer favors, as if what you culled had no name.  A deal's a
deal, you said, and did nothing after that.  No matter after
that, either, but held to no promises were slept or wooden.  This
was the anchor on your doubt, held affirmed doubts had names,
too.  Slid, crept, the favors on your haunch or western boots. 
Poker, shim, detail; all went too soon whereas inert sustenance
relieved you at the sink or door.  When as other's hours were
seeded, this was the newer throng, and in your own hours, this
was the soonest he could pall or fervor.  Favors to the side, no
mention at schooler palms, his own particulars contributed to the
hole in your arms angling down the side, meeting one on one was
too easy, but lunch as fear, but lunch as the door out, but lunch
as the missing element in another drama, laid up by sudden gusts
of wind, and made too soon to become another favor let in the
dark without pity; this was the soonest he could demand at pool
no shims the dusker in his palm, the ridged fold her inner sign,
as pushing or not, the doorways were painted shut.  It'd white,
but not too soon, and whatever folded out was still a beckoning
thigh, colored blue and purple by the dinner bell, this was
something to forget and not too soon for me, either; I'd had
enough to remember and let the others go their winning ways
helped them out, letting go was too soon for definition, but the
remake and the detail shored-up former favors shut or passioned. 
I skipped.  And as this was another room, what went along was the
denial itself, the blue airs, her own sweaters.  This was the
rotor at the melon, pleading for an ancient action.

Larger smoothes the righter corner of what
you see by turns repetitive and unique.
Original size attains its recall, the forward
push of sign & time no longer heals the light.

Long enough today, too, to say you are forgotten
from the earlier stuff, what was it, an 
invasion from within, denying the present its
fresh vigor and original, unspoken purpose.

Broken arrows do not decide the fate of nations,
who would even comment on that is not
no foreign sunsets the mirror'd heart in
its own heat beats the moon around the sky.

Arc & shine, familiar projects.  Yarded-out.  And
the slimmer doors, a tunnel reign, or stammer
or co-rental in the season's own benign to tell,
her's as the moving sign; awaitment has no passage.

Floors to pour.  I'd wrestle signs, their own density
a promise or a spasm, either calls away your
own denial to storm or toss yr lunch.  At flat.
Moulted shin, hero at doubt,  re-lighter from within.

Or boundaried-out, what held former lines exists
no more.  Partitions have a way of waning.

II

Your dick: at said, he dreams her on the wall next
to him, nude by candlelight, energy streaming from 
within at a finger's touch, and music singing
in the background of the evening's heated ways.

What had you done?  Any more decides yr name,
not as doubt, but presence.  New vocabulary
hints new messages are in store again,
but dust you often enough for that!

Had.  No foot the same stream twice, has the

where the new moon says this is it.
And not easy either.  Lesser marks decide.

You've melt, or me.  Again.  He did without.
But the poem is the body, and its progress
indicates perfume, or, perhaps, a message.
The car parked outside means you're here.

The Barracks turned out to be a restaurant,
and the beginning was no longer amazing--
Even buildings on their sides makes sense.
I'd hate to be the one picking up after this.

Slow times has the day ruled-out.  Never a new
beginning beyond that.  Whatever it is, goes
beyond what is said in favor of suggestion/example.

Your dick.  The same day carried forward what's 
against your will, even, and the example
suffices for today where no answer persists.

The day formed out of bounds, and I looked.  My luck.

COTTAGE LOAF


I do not know if in Europe the houses
have sweet handles
Happy fountains of inspirational sayings
fold in rickety solitude their wings

But in America
a piece of house jotted a note on a loaf of bread:
"if my swarthy sweetheart lived I would serve him on my knees. . . ."
"the price of taffeta in the clouds . . .
what can I do to reach it. . .?"

"Victoria gave me a scarf. . . ."
"Yesterday the President died . . . not even
the politicians get saved. . . ."

"Dear Helen I leave my ring to you . . .
keep it safe. . . ."

Flies with soiled legs strolls across my soul.

HOGAZA


No se' si en Europa las casas
de dulces asas
Fontanas de alegres anas
i'ngrimas destartaladas doblen sus alas

Pero en Ame'rica
un pedazo de casa anoto' en una hogaza:
"Si mi negrito viviera le sirviera arrodillada. . . ."
"El precio del tafet'an por las nubes. . .

"Victoria me regalo' una bufanda. . . ."
"Ayer murio' el Presidente . . . ni siquiera
