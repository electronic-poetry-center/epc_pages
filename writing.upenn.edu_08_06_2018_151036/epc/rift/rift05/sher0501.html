</pre>      <i>Sometime about 1202 a court writer--Niccolas de Senlis--
was asked to translate a formerly oral poem into
prose "in the vernacular, unrhymed."  In the 17th
century a group of Quiche Mayan priests translated a sacred text, the
Popol Vuh, from the hieroglyphic into linear, alphabetic
prose--a technology introduced by the missionaries who were just then burning
the hieroglyphic books.</i><pre>

'Fragments are our wholes'--four round words ripped out of
context.  Sound if hole can be health, not to heal against
the bitter patter of deaf words.  Rationed bites of a genre
of closure.  Talking back in frustrated response, where two
streams of words do not make a dialogue.  

Poems admit begin in the pull of the waves withdrawal, tide
precedence.  Rhythm of words makes a mind, if they have ears
like notes a riff of immense reconstruction.  Articulation
means to letter the already there, wave pull centered about
a singular, but poesis.  

Poem's play turning, word-sounds as one way more than we
must talk to each other.  That there is a space for play, a
sound of saved.

Compositional influences: "It was a sorry day when the text
ragged around a chicken leg."  Page break punctuates
imperceptibly, commas causing arrest of motion, froward [sic]
through soft returns that silently bell eyes' carriages to
left-page margin, signless, without moment.  "The paper page
has a presence" but prose flows as the eye goes.



</pre>      <i>The form the text in translation occupies instances a
transformation of the poem; the gradual translation of
writing by electronic means of wordprocessor, even the
publishing of etexts, is often mistaken for transfer rather
than transformation.</i><pre>

Prose are those shamefaced words that deny their upbringing,
hypocrites that'll perform anywhere for the right price,
filling the page in roman, courier, bookman, or gothic,
without the blink of an eye, returns sliding softly by and
aiming to seduce the eye out of format; the format of
electronic text where words are contained within
fields/paragraphs that shrink and widen to fill the screen,
where the soft-return is simply the nod to turn the other
way, nights when reading was the house and quiet was calm

</pre>     <i>When one composes by picking up one letter at a time
from the job case, "books are language and literature become
physical" (Charles Alexander).  The poem inhabits particular
writing space, a surface of page, tablet, papyrus or screen,
that shapes the forms of its meanings.</i><pre>

Print technology is concomitant with the rise of a
particular sense of self, individuality, the rational-
autonomous reader of the prose essay, and the consequent
(anti-poetic) myth of a transparent writing. What we do is
to bring words back.</i><pre>
