Hard Return is wired for sound.  Each [HRt] section associates with at
least two aural versions of the poem (the final verse earns two
extra).  The difference between versions is largely a matter
of intonation, rhythm, and tempo--the words are the same.  Multiple
versions are included to undercut any sense that the verbal
realization
is an adequate or authorative rendering of the poem.  Rather, it is
hoped that the finite versions here presented will be furthur
extended.

These sound files are stored in 16 bit ".wav" format.  While cumbersome
for some readers to work with, this format insures an acceptable
fidelity of sound.
