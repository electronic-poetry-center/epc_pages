COVENANT

In cartoons and dreams people jump into and out of the script,
casual as clams and loaded to the gills with the promise of
evening soon to be smashed in the bland mirror of reproduction.
Even in advertising fate is unaffected but moving,

casual as a clam and loaded to the gills with the promise of
consumption in the hurt confusion of amassed humanity.
Even in advertising fate is unaffected but moving.
And the hallucinated stand on first principles to disdain

consumption in the hurt confusion of amassed humanity.
It occupies the space between multinational wheat cartels
and the hallucinated who stand on first principles to disdain
the hunger of the media for the misery of the people.

It occupies the space between multinational wheat cartels
and the proprietary rights of veritable cargo cults
to the misery of the people and their hunger for the media.
It has been said. Fate is fractal and semi-permeable.

As the proprietary rights of veritable cargo cults
subject to certain prior restraints and binding arbitration.
It has been said. Fate is fractal and semi-permeable.
As the love of the subject for the will to obedience.

Subject to certain prior restraints and binding arbitration
as outlined in the book of breathing and bound to happening
as the love of said subject for the will to obedience.
The arousal of the powers of light against a serial (and viral) fear

as outlined in the book of breathing and bound to happening.
To awake from astonished sleep to routine delusion once again.
The arousal of the powers of light against a serial (and viral) fear.
Something inexplicably missing. Something impossibly precise.

PLAIN/TEXT

The sum of my self's semblances.
An ache made shapely, maybe.
The itinerary of evasions: a most literary
sequence of eventual despair. A sense of
momentous indecision in the unquiet air
around here and no argument to reconcile
to, insistent intense as the discussion is.
This text entity actualized. Vast gasps
of syntax and sighs of delighted wrap-
around. A delicate instrumentality
hidden in the etymologies.
The feel of your fonts.
The tragedy of your line breaks.
The fragrant breezes flutter but
the poetic veneer is as apparent
as the insect which utters such
vernacular (o capacitance o valence).
Give us oracular stutters over
smooth vacuum or esoteric reference.
Rather alchemical tools than ephemeral
relevance. Hypnotized by the spin
of a charming beginning. The obligatory
spectacle ecstasized. My darling diplomat,
plumed and plumbed, overwhelmed under
the confluence of alarming ardours.
De-mystified but never colonized.
A lesson in illegitimacy, illegibility
of the writing on the new and improved
axiomatic wall, depraved may
the flowering be, denied as mere raving.
That frequently green monster seen through
lidless eyestalks heliotropically revolved.
Consider this dissonance. That is not that,
though. The map is not the genetic
expression of a mountain of hats.
Our cartoon existence predisposes us
to such extensions, such attachments.
Disenfranchised yet maintained as
the crying of our numbered lot.
Diagrammatic exactitude forbidden
by inaudible emanence and the graphic
resemblance, moonstruck and maddening,
to a gorilla grin. The taste of grape jelly
suddenly out of memory dumped in my lap.
Oh well and good to be sticky occasionally.
Loony tunes to elucidate this feeling of
"that's all, folks" and happy trails to you.
Until we are meat again. Easy habitation
in the light of another order of being.
Do we read by this illumination
or, merely burnished, turn to each other
and, chastened, make plans to abandon
plans of abandonment? Irreducible
to the statistical, the average bat
in a leveraged game and the actual
factual is the ghost of a flea flattened
in the line dance of armoured person-ality
or a bastion of status to be cultivated
aciduously. A refuge from pleasure,
a certain estimable length to be measured
and the scissors sever the connection.
Is this the commission we were suborned
for? A brief, baffled season of leisure
to wax and polish our carapace and, then,
make space for the next regeneration?
Why else this fabled tale unscrolled,
scryed and de-scribed? Meanwhile,
in another part of the factory we see
demons sorting "abandoned car parts"
and angels huddled over lathes (wings
pinned behind their backs and visors
shielding beatific faces). It is not clear
what is turning, but it is screaming.
"Enough! or too much." The sheared vision,
sharpening popsicle sticks against those
fractal stucco cliffs of my childhood.
The same wide-eyed clarity, utterly
alien landscape imposed upon the familiar
blue meanders. Milkweed pods and monarch
butterfly and the source of all tadpoles
flown over by dragonfly reconnaissance
squadrons. The container holds in many
dimensions, fold as you may or splice it.
No telling the knuckleball flutter of fate.
Was that the Corn Goddess or Coyote
sneaking through the underbrush?
The surge to verbiage blunders
phase foreword into the narrative
passed out in a cornered schematic.
The lap of the loop she indecently reposes,
phrases the fluencies and flesh gestures.
The delicious irony of her body
would sustain many an anemic gnome
or nymph. The flattened affect,
to speak to a machine and mean it,
being as repetitive a stress
as any other.

_from_ MACHINE LANGUAGE

Reconnaissance syntax assimilates
dissonance. Lenses into present
tense. Touch-sensitive text
which we are IN. Bodies
non-possessively. Participated.
Soluble flesh of the processed
word. Being sublimated. Circadian
dervish flurries and burns.
Tympanum verbatim. By ear
unfurled, flanged avalanche.
A flock of weathers passes
overheard. Pliant iambics
of sky and flowers. Vernacular
azure in which we embrace.
