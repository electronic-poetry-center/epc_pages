</a> 
 
I'm Charles Bernstein. <br> 
On today's program, "Poetry on the Line"<br> 
with Robert Creeley.<br> 
<p> 
<U> 
Robert</U> Creeley's <U>Selected Poems</U> <br> 
has just been published by the University of California Press,<br> 
<u>Windows</u> and <u>Echoes</u> are<br> 
new from New Directions.  He teaches in the<br> 
Poetics Program<br> 
at the State University of New York at Buffalo.<br> 
 
<p> 
Bob, two of the poets that you've often<br> 
invoked<br> 
Pound and Olson<br> 
wrote epic poems,  <br> 
poems encompassing history,<br> 
poems incorporating political or cultural documents.<br> 
<p> <br> 
But your own poems seem very much the<br> 
opposite of that . . .<br> 
<p> 
<i> 
Remember, I have one called "Epic"--"leave some<br> 
room for my epic."<br> 
<p> 
 
That's the poem.<br> 
<p> 
 
I could never get<br> 
rolling<br> 
on an epic<br> 
scale, so to speak.<br> 
</i>  
<p> 
 
Why is it that you're drawn as<br> 
models to these <br> 
very . . . <br> 
<p> 
<i> 
They're good people to hang out with<br> 
--speak to the man, Charles.  <br> 
They gave me <br> 
a necessary compensation,  so to speak.<br> 
</i> 
<p> 
Well, measure is something that you often<br> 
write about and think about; and your<br> 
sense of measure seems anti-epic, <br> 
<p> 
 
although I wouldn't say minimal <br> 
as it might be described.<br> 
<p> 
<i> 
. . . like Laurel and Hardy!<br> 
I don't . . . <br> 
<p> 
I was fascinated by their<br> 
abilities both to think, or think 'the' world . . . <br> 
or 'a' world . . . no, 'the' world  <br> 
such as I, also,<br> 
variously knew it.  <br> 
And to find a way of not<br> 
compacting it or compounding it but of--<br> 
not of<br> 
representing it but of--<br> 
of thus using it,<br> 
as though they--not<br> 
took  control of it but--could act in all<br> 
of its various terms, seemingly,<br> 
<p> 
 
and could . . . <br> 
yes, were very stylish and very--<br> 
despite the obvious horrors of some of the<br> 
circumstances nonetheless--<br> 
were, as poets,<br> 
great.<br> 
 
<p></i> 
 
Well, what about your poems' measure?<br> 
What do your poems measure?<br> 
<p> 
<i> 
I guess that <br> 
one echo might be the<br> 
sense of "to see the world in a<br> 
grain of sand."  <br> 
That scale really in<br> 
Herricks' poems,<br> 
Zukofskys', in some ways,<br> 
despite also that Zukofsky wrote a long poem indeed.  <br> 
<p> 
 
Nonetheless its focus, <br> 
I feel,<br> 
is very akin to mine.  <br> 
<p> 
 
I don't know.  I was a piece worker; <br> 
<p> 
 
I liked the sense of,  not so much poem, poem, poem;<br> 
but I like the sense<br> 
of having these <br> 
various things or facets or reflections, <br> 
all of which could be<br> 
could be<br> 
started over and over.<br> 
<p> 
 
As Francesco<br> 
Clemente made this charming remark--that<br> 
unlike the painters line, <br> 
the poet gets the<br> 
chance to start his or her line new <br> 
every time.<br> 
</i> 
<p> 
 
What's the prosody of that?<br> 
I mean, Zukofsky always talks about the music <br> 
of his poetry, and yours seem an extension of a<br> 
musical and prosodic idea  <br> 
that relates to<br> 
Zukofsky?<br> 
<p> 
 
<i> 
I love the way it refracts and sounds<br> 
in the head. That was to me the<br> 
fascination of poetry <br> 
early on, its<br> 
unexpected resonance.  I remember one time with Robert Duncan . . .<br> 
<p> 
 
We were thinking,<br> 
particularly, how long something<br> 
could,<br> 
would sound after it . . .  <br> 
Not, how long it<br> 
would hang in the air--<br> 
but if one said<br> 
'boo' as the opening sound, let's say,  how<br> 
many other syllables<br> 
or units of sound<br> 
could then one add, and still have 'boo'<br> 
resonate,  if it came back 'true'? You know?<br> 
</i> 
<p> 
 
There's<br> 
something  uncanny in your work,<br> 
which I'd say is like the sound of thinking.<br> 
<p> 
 
I sometimes hear thinking sounded<br> 
in the way that, in Walden, Thoreau talks about--<br> 
sounding the bottom of Walden Pond to get its shape, but also <br> 
the sound coming in time.<br> 
I'm thinking of the poem<br> 
"Whatever" . . . .<br>

<h3>1973</h3> 
 
<p> 
What I did was work the day shift, 7 to 3, at a grinding wheel, grinding the glaze off 
the bottoms of cups as they came off the kiln cars.  A thousand cups a day: Jose 
cups, Caprice cups, Mark cups, Conservo cups.  Dozens of colors and designs: black 
spray mist, red 245, Newport gold, Bar Harbor, White Tower.   What I did at night was 
go to U.B. night school.  I had some vague interest in poetry.  There were Beatniks in 
Mad Magazine.  I found On The Road in a drug store.  Jack Clarke was teaching 
Modern Poetry.  In between sips of Red Barrel beer, he told us to check into Creeley.  
Well, hell, I thought this is easy homework.  I was never at a poetry reading.  There 
were few in Cheektowaga.  And rather than class we had to go out and get IT, that is 
read for IT: the poetry and the reading.  We were left to select the means from which 
to approach IT.  So, over in Norton Union in what was Norton Cafeteria, it was 
Creeley's return from someplace and here is this guy I never heard off in knit hat with 
his new book: <i>A Day Book</i>.  The first poem I ever heard, <i>Do you think that if 
/ I said, I love you, or anyone/ said it, or you did.  DO you/ think that if you had all/ 
you really/ would have to think it all into/ reality, the world, each time, new.</i>  Each of 
the cups then was not a cup in my hand.  Each was full for the sipping with an equal 
full cup being sipped someplace.  One million cups on tables somewhere my ears to 
intimate imaginative endless loving conversation.<p>

        We spent the morning and early afternoon reading around in Creeley 
hoping to find something to say to commemorate his 70th, but first one of us 
would exclaim "Listen to this" and the other "Listen," and the day disappeared 
inside his poems instead. The fact is that we again were reading his work as 
we had done 15 years ago and continue to do so now with awe, delight, 
reverence, and human care. In the past decade Bob has also been our teacher, 
advisor, and family friend. But finally, as he always insisted, it is the work 
that matters, for the man whose table we visited was as much a construction 
for each of us out of his own words as the person who stood before us in his 
poems. Or the words are curiously more his person than they ever were. He is a 
great & abiding spirit, a no-nonsense conveyor of everyman's art, all heart.<br> 
Dear Bob, Cheers!<p>

<h3>Emerging Fragility--On Robert Creeley</h3> 
<p> 
Robert Creeley, both the man and the poet, seems acutely attuned to 
fragility.  The way a form we mold out of the domestic turbulence of our 
dailiness can wash away.  The way a form that is not washed away, but 
moves to some sort of <i>completion</i>, will yet be washed away.  The way 
a form holds within it its own tottering state.<br> 
(Nods to Tom Raworth.)<p> 
 
<i>drive, he sd, for<br> 
christ's sake, look <br> 
out where yr going<br></i> 
<p> 
 
We are threatened by physical capriciousness: cars out of control, the 
glass from the windshield in the eye.  The eye worn as a badge for his 
fragility, and ours.  Hence, compassion.  Compassion for a Dutch boy with 
his finger in the dike's hole all night not, as we often think, out of 
determined heroism, but out of a quaking fear that he would be 
<i>shamed/blamed</i>.  We are accidents all, all as fragile as an 
accident.  <i>Truth is a scrawl</i>.  We love out of fragility.  An entire 
poem reads <i>And Ebbe/with love.</i>  Think of the <i>and</i> in this 
poem, and how it implies multitudes.<p> 
 
So the art is sometimes a controlled playfulness, an arena where at least 
the pen, the paper, the body behind the desk can be assumed, are reliable 
<i>givens</i>: <i>Words are pleasure</i>.  So we can at times wonder about 
numbers as would a child. A section in <u>Pieces</u> entitled <i>Five</i> 
begins<p> 
 
<i>Two by<br> 
two with<br> 
now another<br> 
in the middle<br> 
or else at<br> 
the side<br></i> 
<p> 
 
In the security of the writing situation the few words open to pleasure. 
Yet confined to short, controlled lines.  Extravagance leaves the 
fragility open. <p> 
 
Fragility can get messy, particularly when we feel threatened.<p> 
 
<i>For love--I would<br> 
split open your head and put<br> 
a candle in<br> 
behind the eyes<br></i> 
 
<p> 
This stanza is partly bravado, the rhetoric of the dashing, dangerous 
young male lover.  (The book from which it is taken is entitled <i>For 
Love</i>.)  But it is more.  It is vengeance recoiling from persona 
unmasked, the vengeance that protects a basic fragility.  Don't get too 
close, don't peer around certain corners.  Or the words you will encounter 
as surgical blows, small but additive, punctuated by perfect line breaks. 
Your body breaks from small words and the poet stands triumphant.  For 
now. 
<p> 
Ultimately, though, when I think of Robert Creeley I think of compassion 
and graciousness.  Without him we would never have launched <i>Poetic 
Briefs</i>, a magazine that both he and I assumed would have washed away 
by now.  He has my undying gratitude for continuing to care about us young 
poets even into his seventh decade. 
<p> 
At Elizabeth Burns' father's seventieth birthday Elizabeth read 
<i>Theresa's Friends</i>, a poem about Creeley's childhood admiration of 
Irish story telling and, eventually, his learning that the name 
C-R-E-E-L-E-Y is Irish.  This fact meant the stories were now in his, 
Creeley's, blood.  There were many assembled that day, almost all Boston 
Irish and almost all WWII veterans.  Elizabeth told Creeley of the nodding 
laughs that met the line about Cronin's Bar.  Creeley said that he wished 
he had been there.  And he meant it.

<br><h3>After IT by Clemente / Creeley</h3> 
 
 
1.<br> 
Lost in an embryonic lull<br> 
where color and speech<br> 
are the string around<br> 
a finger forgetful<br> 
of emergence as such.<br> 
<p> 
2.<br> 
Contained in vases<br> 
the lull of conversation<br> 
that scriptures its way<br> 
off yr plate &<br> 
into a sun, grayed with<br> 
some such wisdom,<br> 
or another.<br> 
<p> 
3.<br> 
Puzzles of gratitude, a shield<br> 
of honor, 3 blossoms in<br> 
each crescent<br> 
one lion, one secret,<br> 
one sage.<br> 
<p> 
 
4.<br> 
No measure for<br> 
a black flower surrounded<br> 
by spasms of orange<br> 
what rose is this<br> 
the depth that goes on<br> 
through to hearts<br> 
and oracles, leafed<br> 
and thorny,<br> 
a cannon ball of<br> 
simplicity, an illusion<br> 
of growth.<br> 
<p> 
5.<br> 
(icy resurrection, that one in a halo<br> 
 of yellow on a platter of onyx)<br> 
<p> 
6<br> 
This heart the ballooning<br> 
of difficult seeds, made jagged<br> 
& puzzled in the world<br> 
they color with an eloquence<br> 
of speech, a circus of daisies<br> 
all topsy-turvy with love<br> 
of the outer world<br> 
beyond such bricks.<br> 
<p> 
7.<br> 
Swirling in aghast of<br> 
delicate winds, each taking<br> 
a vine & twisting<br> 
till speech makes literal<br> 
all that thought makes<br> 
faded, cautioned, and<br> 
growing ever the more<br> 
beyond the elements<br> 
& such.<br>

<h3>In Imitation of For Love</h3> 
        (with a Line Stolen from Ted Berrigan)<p> 
 
 
If he or she is clumsy in places, those are clumsy places<br> 
and when he or she says I have a lover or a husband or a wife, we or I feel sad,<br> 
or is it just clumsy?<br> 
can't one make it simple, or at least simpler?<br> 
or why can't it be that way for just one moment?<br> 
I am writing this on a hip pocket pad, a waterproof one<br> 
but I am not crying, never crying<br> 
and it never rains when or where in some northern or southern or western <br> 
<pre>     </pre>or eastern city I am writing<br> 
to tell you I've got a crush on you<br> 
cootchi coo<br> 
the waterproof cost me extra<br> 
the words are extra; they don't come with the pad<br> 
the crush, the love is extra<br> 
and you are extra.<br> 
oh, wake up.<br>

  <p> 
  
        It's not that, now, I don't know these words, from the 
introduction to Robert Creeley's WORDS. It's not that I have not known 
them. Instead, it is that my not knowing them has been crucial, to my own 
sense of what a poem might know, and what I might know in relation to it. 
Which is to say, what I might know. 
<p> 
        I have always wanted to know myself, and to know, in relation, 
what I might know of others. If there's anything that Robert Creeley's 
poetry--the first poetry I ever gave a damn about--has taught me, it is 
that a poem is always intimate, however public its address, however final 
its confusions. A poem, at its best, brings us close, in relation, to 
what it might be of us that matters. As close, say, as I might be to you. 
<p> 
        Which is to say not as close, always, as illusion might dream. 
I've always wanted to say of the first of Creeley's lines above that it's 
not RIGHT. I don't know myself in the instant I'm feeling. My feeling is 
ahead of my knowing, or the other way around. Or not even ahead--just 
different, wandering, out there, reaching towards what one can only 
imagine to be. Feeling? Knowing? Words. I don't know myself in the 
instant that's already gone. I don't know you as I don't know me--and 
even the AS is a question. 
<p> 
        It is, then, the status of knowing itself that Robert Creeley has 
helped me question. I see his work and know: all such knowing must begin 
where I do. Where is that? Not a place of containment, control, 
objectively verifiable phenomena, but one that fundamentally understands 
that knowledge can ONLY be intimacy. And only a lost intimacy, as only 
intimacy can be lost. Which is to say that Creeley's sense of knowing IS 
right. He knows how to know, because he knows what knowledge loses. 
<p> 
        A poem, like you, like me, like its lost knowledge, brings the 
distance close, and extends its intimacy to a endless horizon. Finally 
that's how Robert Creeley, as an exemplar, for me, of what it means to 
intimately know the world, knows me in his own lines. I want to cry out 
"I am lost in you, your work has showed me how to be lost." And in that 
intimacy one begins again to fashion a world, for love--a world of 
shattering closeness, that disappears in the intimate distances of the 
oem, real as we are in constant vanishing.
