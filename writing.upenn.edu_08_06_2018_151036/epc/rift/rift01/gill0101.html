<h3>
Adonai
</h3>
<p>
        nibbles on my ear<br>
        chews my eardrum<br>
        and spits it out<br>
<br>
        runs through my insides<br>
        getting drunk on bile<br>
        and spreading it<br>
        as he sails through my veins<br>
<br>
        and I, in my solitude<br>
        cut my skin with a pencil<br>
        thus fulfilling the heavenly covenant<br>
<br>
        and keep underneath my bed<br>
        the nails of a Messiah<br>
        who never arrives<br>
<br>

        (tr. J. Guitart & S. Carhart)
