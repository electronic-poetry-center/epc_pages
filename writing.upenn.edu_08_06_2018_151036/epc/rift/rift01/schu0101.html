<h3>
The Lost Country
</h3>
<p>

	After the long siege, you lose<br>
	Empathy for the unguarded many, of whom<br>
	You were recently one, inebriate with danger<br>
	So constant it seemed artificial.<br>
	<br>
	I think a lot about the line between<br>
	Suffering with and suffering for;<br>
	The preposition demarcates<br>
	Impossibility, a kind of suffering<br>
	I refuse to feel. Do I mean by feeling<br>
	Something self-conscious, something<br>
	Chosen as no one chooses this city,<br>
	Its walls breathing spite like history,<br>
	Making me into one I barely recognize?<br>
	The self's a tyrant, as is necessary<br>
	To maintain your poise where loss is<br>
	So profound you fail to see it<br>
	In the mounds of rubble just cleared<br>
	From the lot next door. The colony<br>
	By the sea proves that beauty's<br>
	Just a screen for horror; naked men<br>
	Shiver from the cold wind off the water,<br>
	And our phrases are too often repeated to mean<br>
	Even the platitudes of sympathy we intend.<br>
	<br>
	Quite possibly, memory <b>is</b> the first art,<br>
	But only if aesthetics grafts itself to pain,<br>
	The jays' sharp chatter met by higher<br>
	Registers and the dull bleeding sound<br>
	of the truck in the next road: all<br>
	The cacophony that resembles our failure<br>
	To speak. Perhaps it's best to invite failure<br>
	For a while, reserve the right to silence<br>
	Until words return, bubbling upward<br>
	Like lava, spelling a vocabulary of terror<br>
	And redemption before the next dispensation.<br>
	To be one within the stream<br>
	May mean the rush of syllables<br>
	Can give us life, if we give in<br>
	To another's empathy for us: language<br>
	Only saves itself, but full immersion in it<br>
	May save us from ourselves.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<h3>	II.</h3>
<br>
	Apprehension is the most agile mode of feeling,<br>
	Gaining ground like a new river writing itself<br>
	Forward, ever forward, not knowing where it's going<br>
	But always worried about it. What is there to fear<br>
	But one's own form? and who's to care<br>
	Unless it's you, paralyzed by the passage,<br>
	Afraid to read further except in digressions,<br>
	Happier prose than most, knowing themselves<br>
	Unworthy of our attention, but beaming between<br>
	The spotlights, stealing the show. How will<br>
	I remember this, the clutch of trees behind<br>
	The house, the frantic sound of leaves dis-<br>
	placed by grackles, jays in search<br>
	Of mites, and all the lost hum of what<br>
	And how I thought about these things?<br>
	<br>
	What stories there will be to tell--only<br>
	Time will tell, and I'm not there yet;<br>
	The present calls us home and there's little<br>
	We can do to change the order of our words<br>
	Despite the dam on the river that makes light<br>
	Of the water gathering behind it,<br>
	A mirror so like a map I'll never tell<br>
	The difference. Is thinking of this<br>
	Romantic, though partially crazed,<br>
	The reflex scare of the scene as you forget it?<br>
	The self a spinning top, gaining speed<br>
	Even as it  loses momentum, and this<br>
	A definition of tragedy that's only slightly<br>
	Against the grain, where one's reflection<br>
	Can no longer show, as it shrinks into<br>
	The mere self of itself. Everything finally<br>
	Gets sealed in like a lion inside a hoop,<br>
	Stalled there because the mind chooses it,<br>
	Lost finally at the very apex of its leap.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>III.</h3><br>
	The wind reminds us of ourselves;      <br>
	The trees in this equation are nouns,<br>
	The wind verbs, transitive at that,<br>
	And transitory, shedding the husks of leaves,<br>
	Bits of paper, fallen nests, though not<br>
	Revealing its core; only the rind<br>
	Of the wind shows. We may be past<br>
	Such equations of ourselves with things,<br>
	But our correspondence tells us otherwise,<br>
	That the words we shed like leaves<br>
	Do not conform to the shapes of sentences.<br>
	The house we share is a vocabulary,<br>
	And our struggles to stay in the same dialect<br>
	Are made more difficult by the way<br>
	In which words break, like shingles;<br>
	Repeated use merely reaffirms the difference<br>
	Between what we say and how the books<br>
	Tell us to say it. Words have dominion over us<br>
	As the tops of trees do over shadows<br>
	That play on the glazy surface of our yard.<br>
	The language recycles itself but is never the same<br>
	Twice; even cliches change<br>
	And that we trust them only means<br>
	We distrust stability, as we do<br>
	Any history that happens before our birth.<br>
	Try to re-capture what was never<br>
	In the first place captured; barring<br>
	That, create from point zero something<br>
	You always suspected was true,<br>
	Like the wind inside a jar, always abstract<br>
	And never there.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>IV.</h3><br>
	Distance is the face of the wind<br>
	Turned back to see what it just left;<br>
	And proximity has no face, unless it's yours,<br>
	Which I see as obverse metaphor<br>
	For what is literally true,<br>
	The slope of sunlight a dustmote climbs<br>
	As if it were the ladder to a firmer sight,<br>
	Unaligned with sadness or aught else<br>
	There is that can't be seen, but felt.<br>
	That's why the act of defining things<br>
	Is so necessary, even as it passes<br>
	Into obscurity, the slipped disc<br>
	Of the sun declining into a marsh<br>
	Whose water is as flat as paper,<br>
	Though not so sheer. What we feel<br>
	About this is not so clear, words clotting<br>
	As soon as formed, but making a field<br>
	In which to talk about it; nothing<br>
	Else holds us together and yet nothing<br>
	Is so difficult to remember as pain,<br>
	Which is like a lake whose shores<br>
	Denote the difference between pain<br>
	And what it teaches us, the art<br>
	Of recollection without reliving,<br>
	Wisdom as the applied memory<br>
	That mediates between the present<br>
	And what constructed it, the past's most<br>
	Certain contingencies.  Have we got<br>
	To the point where poems think<br>
	Out their implications, not stopping<br>
	For sunsets or even the dislocations<br>
	Of place, which refigure the self<br>
	In ways we can never know?  Or is<br>
	There no thinking but in music,<br>
	The force of counterpoint like an ever-<br>
	moving system, never stopping, even<br>
	For history, which is the substance<br>
	Of time without its spirit?<br>
	Sometimes I balk at that thought that<br>
	Poems create anything apart from themselves<br>
	Except the momentary glimmers<br>
	Of feeling so undefinable they may not<br>
	Exist outside intuition, the sideways<br>
	Surfaces of words turned like rear-view<br>
	Mirrors to catch the sight of nothing<br>
	But what the wind does, scattering<br>
	Leaves and sunlight on the concrete<br>
	Like shadow-boxers.  The shifting currents<br>
	Of sadness and happiness are less<br>
	Shared than shareable, the yellow plain<br>
	Of being together where nothing finally settles<br>
	But sunlight, like the flakes of food<br>
	In a fishbowl, sifting downward<br>
	From surface into depth,<br>
	A metaphor so simple it must be true.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>V.</h3><br>
	Late morning--none of the animals in the yard<br>
	Is content; from all corners there come<br>
	Screeches, and the dull monotone<br>
	Of a territorial imperative<br>
	Somewhere being violated . . . by me?<br>
	I feel immune from the danger<br>
	That narrows to a symphony of noise<br>
	As overhead helicopter and airplane<br>
	Contribute their piece, until silence seems<br>
	The barest nostalgia. Abstraction<br>
	Is the mind's own silence, retreat<br>
	From danger, the predator's cave,<br>
	And when I go there I hardly notice<br>
	What it is I'm leaving: the thought<br>
	Of leaving you for now, an old fear<br>
	That what one leaves one loses<br>
	--How much easier to write that pronoun<br>
	As if by fiat one could transcend<br>
	The selfishness that still defines us,<br>
	Self-creation having no rules<br>
	But those we write as we go along.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>VI</h3>.<br>
	As these lines go on they lose<br>
	Their substance, as cities their suburbs,<br>
	Gathering strength for the inevitable<br>
	Implosions and inept expositions<br>
	That lack a landscape. No<br>
	Landscape finally is necessary,<br>
	Though it gives us names for who we are<br>
	And doesn't tease us with the promise<br>
	That we share the land with others; hence<br>
	The loneliness it offers,<br>
	Desolate even in the midst of plenty.<br>
	For what we take of the land<br>
	We can never give back<br>
	Except in the names we affix to signs<br>
	That mean less than we want<br>
	Them to mean. Always someone<br>
	Was there before us, taking away<br>
	What had never promised to be<br>
	Ours, like the Ohio rivers<br>
	That wend their way through valleys<br>
	Dotted by the shells of houses,<br>
	Trailers, the paraphernalia<br>
	Of rootedness without its reasons.<br>
	Someday the land will forget,<br>
	Thrusting us into the limelight<br>
	And casting us out like first<br>
	Travellers, into the hidden valleys<br>
	Where we will be content,<br>
	Though free of words, which swim<br>
	Through the humid air like hawks.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>VII.</h3><br>
	Ovid must have felt the irony<br>
	Of exile for one who no longer wanted it,<br>
	Virtue in the language of the markets<br>
	Reduced to its negative in the clear air<br>
	Of the islands, white houses set like teeth<br>
	In a jaw that knows silence not as the lack<br>
	Of speech but as its substitute, the way<br>
	The exhilaration of roller-coaster rides<br>
	Comes to replace the near-ecstasy<br>
	Of the heretic who can't abandon<br>
	The old language of the church: Latin<br>
	Dusted our shoulders like butterflies,<br>
	Threatening decadence with origins,<br>
	Substituting our history for ourselves.<br>
	Having learned to praise, we forget<br>
	The inevitable mediocrity of origins:<br>
	Instances of doubt we refuse to name,<br>
	Choosing to hold to the old stories<br>
	Of conquest, deserts crossed and then<br>
	Forgotten, like those who show us<br>
	Not heroes born of conflict<br>
	But emblematic standers-in,<br>
	Being in division for its own sake,<br>
	Because we cannot do otherwise, knowing that<br>
	The sun never sets twice in the same<br>
	Way, except when you give memory<br>
	Access to the desire that exacts<br>
	A toll for every image it delivers.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>VIII. </h3>    <br>
	Spontaneity and sorrow: I used to think<br>
	Them linked as by an umbilical that draws<br>
	The continuous present into disjointed<br>
	Futures, where what's past is best<br>
	Remembered with regret, the perverse nostalgia<br>
	In which one loves the past precisely<br>
	Because it could have been better lived.<br>
	An odd disjunction arises between my old<br>
	Self--so long at the center of things,<br>
	Careering off-course as effectively     <br>
	As a race car with a broken axle--<br>
	And my present one (certainly not new,<br>
	Just more consistent) who's losing<br>
	Contact, nay faith, with and in its past<br>
	Incarnations. Thank goodness, you might say,<br>
	There's so much archeology to perform<br>
	As from a clear platform that abuts the sea,<br>
	Acknowledging distance only<br>
	As an ancient rite, yet enjoying<br>
	It no less. Perhaps such pedantic visions<br>
	Are merely prologue to the epic<br>
	That comes after, when the desired<br>
	Exile is restored, literal this time,<br>
	Not some further ism of the mind<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>IX.</h3><br>
	Whatever we remember of farmland<br>
	We forget it here, where grapevines tease their wire<br>
	And miniature apple trees, likewise tethered,<br>
	Give off the scent of flowers that promise   <br>
	But do not yet deliver; roses, the merely<br>
	Decorative, climb up the wooden gazebo,<br>
	Installed like a sentry box above<br>
	The lower fields. Nearby a spring burrows<br>
	Through the hill, a clear vein, and it takes<br>
	Work to see how simplicity becomes<br>
	So strange, so in cahoots with all<br>
	The subtle grammar of the seasons      <br>
	And how we ever forgot this, immured<br>
	To a landscape rendered more strange<br>
	By our presence, making words<br>
	To govern it, as the frame of a picture<br>
	Implies closure, even if you know<br>
	There are other fields to walk, and love<br>
	The complexity of simple things. Take this   <br>
	Bumblebee, its traffic pattern evident, though<br>
	Unmeasurable, stitching an invisible cord<br>
	Between the pollen's collocations. Or<br>
	The young brown bird with white breast<br>
	That follows its parent, screaming for food<br>
	As if there were no other anywhere<br>
	Who needed more than this reward.<br>
	<br>
	Abstraction, then, is either too easy<br>
	Or too difficult; must be implicated<br>
	In the radical fact of the world,<br>
	Its gardens no emblem of simplicity<br>
	But an achieved grace, camouflaged<br>
	By our willingness to accept it<br>
	At face-value, and to read ourselves<br>
	As the players on its stage; no wonder<br>
	It takes so long to know oneself at all,<br>
	Since we are less categorical than inspired<br>
	By the categories themselves; no throw<br>
	Of the dice is unexpected, and nothing<br>
	Anymore astonishes, although<br>
	We've long ago been estranged<br>
	From every assumption there ever was.<br>
