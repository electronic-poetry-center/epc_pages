<h3>RIFF #1 
</h3>
<p>

"The presence of the original is the prerequisite for the concept of
<a 
href="../rift02/frie0201.html#authenticity">authenticity</a>."  [Walter Benjamin] 

<p>

This may not be the first time I've said so, but allow me to risk rewriting
myself: <a name="real">Everything</a> I write is a forgery!  That said, the word is free to
quote or recycle itself, to riff to its heart's<a name="done"> content.</a>  "How does one
know," in terms of content now, "when a poem is <a 
href="rift0101.html#kuszai.done">done?</a>": concept of the poem 
as fixed, final object, as a function of the paper text's <a 
href="../rift02/frie0201.html#economy">economy</a>.  A RIF/T
riff never knows but that it's not the initiation of its own echo.  

<p>

Reverberation.

<h3>RIFF #2 
</h3>

<p>
"You can't have art without <a 
href="../rift02/frie0201.html#resistance">resistance</a> in the material" [William Morris] 

<p>

We are truly "hemmed in by oceanic verisimilitude", and it is so real that
it feels, virtually. But if we could only talk more fluently with our
machines, achieve increased awareness, interface through a more
user-friendly environment.... 

<p>

RIF/T makes no claims for a new, technologically improved poem.  The very
vocabulary of the machine--<a 
href="../rift04/rift0401.html#derivation">"Content-transfer-encoding:7BIT"</a>--betrays any
such cyber-utopianism into the impossiblity from which poetic form extends.

<p>

At the site of writing, if now <a name="conceptions">QWERTY</a> substitutes for quill as the writer's
fetishized <a 
href="../rift02/frie0201.html#tool">tool</a>, how does it shape practice?

<h3>RIFF #3</h3>
<p>
 

<a name="definition">"...prose</a> consists less and less of _words_ chosen for the sake of their
meaning, and more and more of _phrases_ like sections of a prefabricated
hen house....rift within the lute....meaning (what is a 'rift', for
instance..." [George Orwell, "Politics of the English Language"] 

<p>

In language, which came first: the riff or the hen house.  The meaning of
the rift within the lute--a lately dead metaphor, now resuscitated--lies
(or "As I Lay") precisely among such elipses, between the quoted and the 
excised, at the superimposition of various riffs, in the dissonance between: 
an interest, not in fidelity to the <a name="original">source</a>, but in the derivations and deviations from it.

<h3>RIFF #4 
</h3>

<p>
Olson: where focus but at inches "all the rest beyond that point... what IS
all that out there we CALL focus?" 

<p>

Within any single "tone" the preceptive ear may tune to a number of
separate enharmonics ascending mathematically from the base, or root. The
drone sound contains numinous signifying potentials which are enhanced or
diminished by the physical qualities of the space, and variously perceived
by the ear. 


<p>

<p>

<p>









<h3>RIFF #5 </h3>

<p>


Freud's image of the city: all of Rome's history materialized at present
moment in its appropriate place.  "There is no point in spinning our
phantasy any further, for it leads to things that are unimaginable and even
absurd. If we want to represent historical squence in spatial terms we can
only do it by juxtaposition in space; the same space cannot have two
different contents." [Freud, _Civilization and Its Discontents_] 

<p>

<p>

<p>





<h3>RIFF #6 
</h3>
<p>

"words in my mind hum." [Robert Grenier] 

<p>

The industrial age is marked by an increase in ambient flat-line noise, a
constant drone not usually found in nature.  This low-fi landscape is
exceedingly continuous, with no perspective, and no sense of duration. The
North American ear settles on a B natural as primary tone, its ohm. This is
the frequency of transmission for household electrical current. 
[see _Tuning of the World_ by R. Murray Shaefer]

<h3>RIFF #7 
</h3>
<p>

A social <a name="organ">acoustic</a>. 

<p>

"The sound in Norman and Gothic churches surrounding the audience,
strengthens the link between individual and community.  The loss of high
frequencies and the resulting impossibility of localizing the sound makes
the believer part of a world of sound.  He does not face the sound in
'enjoyment'--he is wrapped up by it."  [Kurt Blackopf qtd. in Shaefer]

<p>

What might the <a name="sculptor">sculptor</a> mean by "<a name="resistance">resistances</a> of the material"?


<p>

<p>

<p>








<h3>RIFF #8 </h3>

<p>

Improvisation, that incessant riffing, the <a 
href="../rift03/hudd0301.html#drone">drone</a> of circular breathing, 
playing across always or against some background, some linguistic, assumed
fabric.  The relationship of figure and ground can be displaced by the
alternately tuned ear. 

<p>

The <a name="page">Paper-copy</a> is but a facsimile of.  Conceive of RIF/T as riffing toward 
the unauthoritative variorum edition, extracting from the poem the false 
authorities of the fine binding, filigree edges, transforming the text into 
the <a name="equivocation">material ghost</a> if itself and author to phantasm.

<p>

And if <a 
href="../rift02/frie0201.html#poem">the poem</a> is nothing but the "particular tatoos marking a particular 
book's paper skin." [Barnstone]

<PRE>
"And Tian said, with his hands on the strings of his lute.
The low sounds continuing
		after his left hand left the strings
And the sound went up like smoke, under the leaves,
And he looked after the sound:"

				[Pound, Canto XIII]

<h3><a name="aesthetics">RIFF #10</a>
</h3>
<p>

"If a <a name="forger">forger's</a> signature ever ponts its reader beyond the document to the
person who signed it, the forger is in trouble."  [Clark]

<p>

"The distinction between author and public is about to lose
its basic character"  [Walter Benjamin]
