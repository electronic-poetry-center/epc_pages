<h3>Beyond Emaciation</h3>

<p>

	Hemmed in by oceanic verisimilitude<br>
	quite a lot like blazing pumps<br>
	with pompadour upholstery, bloated<br>
	enough to play a hunch on<br>
	lumpy reprehension, sputtering<br>
	atop murky monstrosity of<br>
	chronic maldistribution of rectifiers,<br>
	like the match that hit point<br>
	at the expense of spooners, or<br>
	the pompadour that cartwheeled<br>
	past Tumultuous Expectation <br>
	(Evacuation), slogging through <br>
	packed pitfalls and penny-dreadful<br>
	circuits, melody of tilts <br>
	& tailspins, tunnels &<br>
	torches.  Suds, these are my<br>
	suds -- any attribution to<br>
	corroded (corrugated) segment,<br>
	spooked the stake and succumb<br>
	to eviscerated haberdashery<br>
	on line at navigational stump --<br>
	bumpy calculus to somewhere<br>
	near argumentation's eponymous <br>
	mortuary.  Then walking ahead<br>
	or backing off, gesticulating<br>
	with meretricious momentum,<br>
	salamander retrieval intercepts<br>
	gummy (gulled) garrulousity<br>
	who meant all the time to<br>
	throw the dice to the other<br>
	corridor.  The ball rolls <br>
	down the lane or street or<br>
	curb or row or meeting<br>
	ground and the titular<br>
	turner stoops <br>
	to swoop it up <br>
	but<br>
	<br>

[I was delighted by the subject of lecture by J-F Lyotard which I
kept hearing as 'beyond emaciation', just my topic, so it was
with some great disappointment that, after a while, I realized
the philosopher's title was "Beyond Emancipation".  C.B.]

<h3>sketch #1: cleaning the stage</h3>
<br>
	order unspools another study of the mind --<br>
	spoken love broken with thoughts fallen<br>
	to the floor, the words of youth prostrate by insect hunger,<br>
	the pockets of disease in shamble.<br>
	<br>
	when we look again, lights collide.<br>
	teeth wear to sea pebbles.<br>
	the whirling strain of each belly becomes a parchment lantern<br>
	and the soul burns through.<br>
	<br>
	our bone's ambition<br>
	plays on this emptiness, unhinged<br>
	when definition moves<br>
	beyond sense: a cup of stale coffee,<br>
	ganges muck,<br>
	boot dirt --<br>
	<br>
	how we assume chaos:<br>
	beached in the shade of a palm tree where heat agrees<br>
	to splay the boundaries,<br>
	where thought shingles to sediment in the riverdream,<br>
	where water gives promise.<br>
	<br>
	we knuckle under entropy:<br>
	skin raven by love's channel,<br>
	grief encircled by flame, ashes<br>
	repeated to nothing:<br>
	to another act --<br>
	<br>
	the stage set, worn out of order.<br>
	even our desires sublimate,<br>
	cancers miscoding sequence, intention:<br>
	like sacks of water.<br>
	<br>

<h3> sketch #5: Heisenberg's barrier
</h3>
<br>

	the mind moves between the self and the all else,<br>
<br>
	how I may know the place of me at an instant<br>
	but neither the direction nor the velocity of my desire --<br>
<br>
	as we narrow in on one ruptured expression<br>
	all the other edges unbind<br>
	to hold again the universal complexity --<br>
<br>
	a weaving knotted:<br>
	the conscious and the sleeping,<br>
	the wave and the stone.<br>
		<br>


<p>


	<h3>sketch #6: resolved</h3>
	
<br><br>
	the beat is a heart a breath life cycle tying<br>
	to a 13 moon night --<br>
	<br>
	the harvest king dead in december<br>
	not from malice but dysfunction.<br>
	<br>
	trying to cut the unbreakable wheel, to<br>
	discredit Shiva we suffer Shiva's dance<br>
	in never born dimension:<br>
	<br>
	instead of calmly: in the pastoral sense:<br>
	we invoke atomic horror, rupturing the fabrics<br>
	of existence to sleep at night --<br>
	<br>
	for faulting the first row,<br>
	for pretending knowledge before accord<br>
	and the point<br>
				  before the current.<br>
	<br>
	love can still beauty in shapeself absolution.<br>
	but we dine troubled<br>
	by the abyss of a disspun future.<br>
	<br>
	within this I may be here,<br>
	or several inches to the left --<br>
	<br>
	I know I am the biological god<br>
	and I am satan<br>
	but most often some frequency in between.<br>
	<br>
	yet we deny Shiva the dance,<br>
	for fear, through pride.<br>

	lust quenched in a bucket of knifeless water:<br>

<p>

	   To think of the effect of losing<br>
	   affect in art is to effect<br>
	   a change in our conception<br>
	   of sentiment, which is always<br>
	   its own idea, the surge around<br>
	   the heart inscribed upon the heart,<br>
	   memory's task to trace the wound,<br>
	   stencil it on the impalpable history<br>
	   of sensation, cultural artifact<br>
	   beyond comparison.  I cannot<br>
	   think of him without feeling<br>
	   an old aura, as of pleasure's<br>
	   difficulty, inextricable weave<br>
	   as hope confronts its end<br>
	   and refuses to give ground,<br>
	   logic the final confine of sense.<br>
	   Thought is braided through<br>
	   by tact, touching without<br>
	   seeming to change a body, whether<br>
	   of the sea or self.  She says<br>
	   the sea cannot laugh, is eternal<br>
	   in its serious contemplation<br>
	   of shorelines, tidal provinces.<br>
	   She would laugh at such pre-<br>
	   dispositions to be severe,<br>
	   though I thought I heard<br>
	   water laugh, or did it lap,<br>
	   on a black beach beside<br>
	   the catherdral-work of rock,<br>
	   responsive to the fluted<br>
	   shape of air.  Surely, wind laughs<br>
	   always.  World's affect presses<br>
	   against my skin, impresses laughter<br>
	   on my malleable body, as the sound<br>
	   of carnivals disperses<br>
	   in wind, creating pools of voices<br>
	   just past possibility of connection.<br>
	   Tissued by what seems remorse<br>
	   but is not, rather an episode<br>
	   of rethinking feeling, transposing<br>
	   the muted strings to organwork<br>
	   in the wild air beside abrupt cliffs:<br>
	   This my task, to reorder what is<br>
	   already ordered, to wrap my words<br>
	   in your tender air and make<br>
	   myself a fluted column<br>
	   cerebral and yet attuned to what<br>
	   makes the world's end seem possible<br>
	   and not to be feared as holocaust.<br>
	   The guns are still warm<br>
	   that would destroy all I wish to hold--<br>
	   sweet stone or you--enveloped<br>
	   in the savage ardor of my words.<br>

<h3>Monopoems</h3>
<p>
The principal difference between poetry and fiction, even at the
avant-garde extremes, is that the latter implies narrative and
thus movement from one place to another, even if the fiction is
only one world long, while poetry realizes concentration of image
and effect.  These poems, unlike my stories, should be published
without full stops.

<p>
The moment of critique (and poetry) it seems to me stems from a
moment of crisis; writing covers this crisis, perhaps destroys it. I
am trying to respond to a moment of crisis I have perceived in
my environment. That crisis is the invocation of a literary
technology of jargon as a surrogate for discovery, inquiry and
investigation.

<p>

<h3>The Technological State of Poetry</h3>

<p>

Technology never constitutes an end in itself, although its
message  may indeed be the media by which it expresses our
lives. So we have become vapid, mere ciphers, indicating that
there is in fact someone home, but after endless knocking no one
answers. The cough and the sputter by which writing undertakes
itself is similar to this occasional bumbling discussion of
technology, its metonymic tentacles fingering. As strategy, as
technique, languages are developed which account for this
sputtering, these aphasic disturbances which preclude the
possibilities under possibility's name. Speech from disordered
personalities is not the same as an ordered functionalist
appropriating negative qualities - a kind of law of increasing
returns exuding from negative space. This ex nihil poetic wealth,
its rhetoric, is based upon the productive appropriation of
negative or anti-productive terms.

<p>

     triste tourist<br>
What happens when a writer says  I am in exile  who is not in
exile? It freezes and destroys living possibility. Writing may be like
exile, but exile it is not. To appropriate such terms is the last
vestige of the colonial, the disenfranchisement and dispossession 
of that with which it sought affinity. A politically dangerous
perspective; even more, the invocation of jargon creates an empty
vessel the writer hopes will speak for him/her. It is a facile
mockery of responsiveness: necessitated by a wealth which it
constantly alludes to by its indifference.

<p>

A metaphysical stranger is not the same as a real person living in
exile. For many people who arent writers, the fact of
dispossession is a way of life. That the writers identify themselves
with people in exile does not make this claim credible. The
rhetoric of exile is the living link between the historical situation
of a dispossessed and the metaphoricity of the claim of the
poet/critic searching for some position from which to write. Are
we so adrift that even the claims of identification with exile move
like continental plates under wandering sands, breaking up
catching the sky aflame. And yet to stop this movement, to assert
that the sands of the desert are no longer shifting is to fill this
hopelessness with the even more incredible hardening of
concretes. To do this would be an absolute cynicism; a false
consciousness precipitated by what the claims of exile are based
on: that is, the belief in a homeland. To say exile as metaphysical
and not to live it (i.e. to make a metaphor of it) is to feign pain
behavior.

<p>

Pain has no memory: pain has no thought. Yet memory is the life
of pain made clear by/in/with the body. Here, the matter of
prepositions is likewise ambivalent. Pain crosses the
frictive/fictive corrosive frontiers: it has no memory because by
its insistence, it obliterates all time, is a myth so painful that the
unqualified life of consciousness or subjectivity becomes so
overtly destructive that it annihilates anything that would exist
otherwise. Translation, which productively buries its  source,  is
the  scar  and demonstrates the painful nature of writing. Pressed
so close providing a polite resonance of that which it covers, the
scar could be anything; is in fact everything. The invocation of
wounds as abstract and ornamental demonstrates the activity
against which they poise their <a 
href="riff0101.html#resistance">resistance.</a>

<p>

Yes, these claims are  compelling,  but to allow them to go
unchecked, would simply affirm. To deny them by critique would
be to defang their claim to authenticity and rule by displacement.
A dictator in exile has no right or claim to authority any more
than a dictator in place. What is a person if not near-frozen to
death in isolation? Admitting ones exile is to admit defeat in the
face of impossibility. It does not reduce the pain but instead
thickens the scar which covers, demonstrates and destroys its
<a 
href="riff0101.html#original">origin.</a>
<p>
     livre ivre<br>
So as there is sol in solus, there is drunk in book.  The necessity
of pushing past the limits of the written. The owl of Minerva molts
at dusk, then complains. The signs are dripping off of things, the
skin peeling back the method of pastiche, its eventual palimpsest.
One is not constituent of an argument, of arrangement. We are
surrounded by quotations and so are drowned out by the  sound.
Words are small ambassadors we seek to be among. They would go
on without us; representative but not representative; sovereign
charges.

<p>
<a name="kuszai.done">The</a> public sphere as a private mental category. 
How does one
know when a poem is done? Down in the heat of it, down in the
metabolic whispers, such borders are like living cells. The little
acids however environmentally determined are based on sets and
patterns of influence, the cells interchange -- this is all very
routine. The membranes sheer response to its external influence
is the broad chemical daylight edges into windows caked with
euphoria sweat and answers more akin to agoraphobia than
possible discourse. The form of the body is pressed hard against
the form of the poem. The pain is in harmony against the page
the art work and the body.

<p>

I am interested in questions, but I have served them to
destruction. The gravel of the heart grinds itself to friction
and discomfort. It, like the negative dialectic, incorporates
its own demise within the technology of its function. It
participates but is ridiculed for being anti-productive. Its
uselessness incorporates antithesis. I realized I had to begin
with my life, my questioning. My <a 
href="../rift03/hudd0301.html#method">method</a> 
is my own life, those with whom I am in contact are what it consists of.

<h3>Sermon on Language</h3>

<p>

 
This - I mean whatever comes to mind when you read this -
is an organization - from the proto-Greek organ-grindo, "the
music swells, the monkey dances"- dedicated to enshrining
reality deep in the heart of itself.  Its code name is Language,
and it was invented a war or two ago - actually during the
Second Gobi War, the one that ended the paleolothic - to con-
fer on sunlight such blessings as "It is sunning," or "The sun is
raining," or "Shine happens," according to the by-laws of your
local lodge.  For individual languages - like Basque or Xhosa
or Cantonese or French - are in fact created and sustained as
lodges of the ancient freemasonic society of Speakers, the ones
with Language on their side, the so-called humans. All other
societies -and every form of society- is subsidiary to this, this
elegant and persuasive artifact which self-embeds its rules and
by-laws at once in every member who pays the dues of breath -
what we call speaking.   You do not have to think very long or
hard to learn that all mysteries are ensconced in language and
extractable from language, and that obedience to the intricacies
of language in turn reveals the exact astro-dynamic efflorescent
energy of place and circumstance we nickname Truth.  The con-
juncture. The lock. The habit the heart wears in the market, the
song it hums in the bathroom, the text encoded in its midnight
snores. Language is astrology indoors, it is the moon in the bed-
room and the sun in your pocket, its rules are your rules and
there is hardly a rumor - though there is a rumor - of anyone
disobedient to its prescriptions.  Timid Nietzsche and meek
Blake followed its laws like lambs, and Lenin lay down with De
Maistre to graze on public language.   Only the one - there
was one - who woke up to the sleep of named things ever broke
the lodge law and got away with it.  All the way away.  Faint-
ing, we follow.

<h3>Ohio Zen</h3>


<p>

	   Remarks prepared for the "Storming the Reality Studio"
	   panel (moderated by Larry McCaffery, "refereed" by
	   Robert Coover, and featuring Kathy Acker, Ginevra
	   Bompiani, Marc Chenetier, Samuel R. Delany and Michael
	   Joyce) as part of Unspeakable Practices II, Festival of
	   Vanguard Narrative, Brown University February 24-27,1993.

<p>

Years ago I sometimes walked through honeysuckle hills of southern
Ohio with my father-in-law, a man who knew all the names of trees
and the Indian cure for asthma. Because it was the seventies I, of
course, did as my electrodes told me and romanticized his sense of
nature. One time just as we emerged from a steamy trail of maples
and low sassafras into the light, he said, "Lookie there, how
beautiful that is!" I tried to see what he saw against the far
hills, but saw only the contrail scars of a distant jet across the
sky.

<p>

"What's that, Pete?" I asked.

<p>

"Them contrails," he said, "are beautiful."

<p>

I don't know much about algebra, don't know what a slide-rule is
fo', don't know much about reality studio, but I do know, or think
I know, that to be a vanguard in an age that bottles vanguard like
papaya salsa will likely involve Ohio-mindedness, a constant state
of oscillation and contrariness (what hyperfiction writer Carolyn
Guyer calls the buzz-daze) whose zen becomes the truism etched by
chase lights into terrazzo by that Ohio zen sensei Jenny Holzer:
"At times inactivity is preferable to mindless functioning."

<p>

Those who do not understand histamines are condemned to repeat
sit-coms. We will need an Ohio-zen in the  fantasy islands of
Fujisney, where before long everyone will be able to sniff the lie
of virtuality and author grave stones with chase lights.  The
problem with virtual reality (which is to say our imagination of
the future) is that it attempts to reproduce the supposed
seamlessness of the aural,visual, and psychological world. No
contrails.  VR as it stands means to be meaningful  when it should
be event-full, or empty (and so fall down and surrender).

<p>

Thus I'd like to propose what I'd call an aesthetic of %a-
polemikos%, of giving way(s) to time, of  sit calm rather than
sitcom.  A swooning zen in which the first thing a vanguard ought
to do is give up, stay where we are, even go backwards. Look for
someone to surrender to; insist that someone's in charge. Which is
to say, look for an edge, the temporary autonomous zone, the
interstitial.  Such a zen involves a six-fold way.

<p>

1) Forget toys. Those of us who grew up when there used to be New
Cars know that technology is three card monte and sells the future
as a hedge against unhappiness about the cards on the table.  The
Ohio-minded shift through the whole range of Hydromatique before
moving to StratoCruiser.  Which is to say, make art in the
technology possessed by the most of whom you think your current
audience is; it will make them both happy and perplexed about the
need for a trademarked future.

<p>

2) Be like Eve: point out how they always change the names, eat
the centerpiece, get dizzy at the big dance and fall down.  In our
garden of endless representation, aflow in the heavy water of the
aleatory convergence, we think we are aware of the merging of
somethings into Something   Hypermedia, multiple fiction, virtual
reality, autopoesis, semantic space, simstim, cyberpunk, cyborg,
grundge, rave, wax, or the discovery of television among the bees,
sweet honey in the rock and roll: Dave moves into the Ed Sullivan
studio. "Give it up," as Arsenio says.

<p>

3) Wonka not Disney. "So much time, so little to do," instead of
"small world afterall." Let our desire be a criticism that lapses
before the form and so won't let form return to transparency; a
criticism in which-- rather than standing still--"With each step,"
as Laurie Anderson says, "you fall forward slightly./And then
catch yourself from falling.."

<p>

4) Stop fucking yourself. Whether you live in a MUD  or a VR (a
multi-user dimension/dungeon or a virtual reality), don't measure
interaction as first personhood.  Interaction manifests itself
through recognition, sympathy, and witness as much as through
impersonation, perception, and exploration.

<p>

5) Mind your manners. When authorship is proferred, refuse it;
when authorship is generalized, claim it. If they say you're an
author, refuse to be; if they say everyone's an author, tell them
your name is Willa or Edna.  Constant declination continually
renders control meaningless. We need to be content and in so being
become the content of our own passionate technology.

<p>

6) Sometimes a vanguard ought to look like an old guard. Tell
stories about fathers-in-law and when there used to be
automobiles, have great expectations, let the dead come back to
life on the overleaf. It is as Helene Cixous says, "the mode of
passivity is our way-- really an active way-- of getting to know
things by letting ourselves be known by them.  You don't seek to
master... [b]ut rather to transmit: to make things loved by making
them known."
<p>



<h3>Myself</h3>

<p>


I do not mean to tell you how to read this as much as how you
might think of writing it.  These spaces offer some idea of what
has lead to the time I write this, what I think as I do so, and
what might follow from it. All of these spaces (at least those
contained within this section called "myself") are meant to be in
the most authentic voice I can here summon, knowing aside from
the theoretical questions that my own authenticity is always in
question even for me. Aware always also that as soon as you have
read this I begin to disappear or, like Mallarme's swan, freeze
into the form of my own inaction.

<p>

( 9.20.92 summer's end)

<p>

*<u>Ten years later</u>

<p>

My search is for what authentically can be said about a life, how
people talk about what is in their hearts and whether it is
possible to do so at all outside the ironical.  6..13.91

<p>

*<u>September</u>

<p>

Forms begin to show themselves.  I just took a call from Julia P
at the VC public relations office asking for a brief definition of
hypertext. I gave her the one from ^the encyclopedia article,
"Hypertext readers not only choose the order of what they read but
in doing so also alter its form by their choices."

<p>

Then, moments later, writing in the space called
"Transformations," I name Bess Julia.  I am beginning to see again
how these stories crisscross themselves, and again find myself
falling back on this stratagem of not so much confusing as
_fusing_ identities in the way Jane Yellowlees Douglas suggests^,
moving one fictional space over another as in my (old favorite)
image of the stereopticon.  Thus, since these spaces are meant to
take a first step toward opening contours up to whoever you are
(and hello to you, love; call me up and I'll put your name here;
actually the whole point is that you can do so yourself, no?),
this note marks such a shift, such a weaving.

<p>

Otherwise these have been brilliant days here as I wrote in the
journal for Jera, who is the model for Obie, this his "book" (what
Wittgenstein calls an album).

*_autumnal walkings_

<p>

Two days ago two ducks swam the thin rapids beneath the foot
bridge along Fontyn Kill (just past the Shakespeare garden), the
bridge I think of as the place where I made my pact with Eamon
against my anger when we stopped here this past summer.

<p>

At my footfall on the bridge they splashed ahead into the small
pool, gliding and widening it in doing so: mallards.

<p>

Later the storm lays down a large tree along the drive in front of
Rombout, the crack and wheezing sigh followed by the easing thud
in the persistent rain and constant wind.

<p>

Yesterday morning by the gravel path around the shore of Sunset
Lake (which darkens and seems deeper now than its jade-scummed
late August shallows) three crows sat in profile just beyond the
bridge of the pact.  Returning last night three drummers beat
talking rhythms on the opposite shore where they sat on a bench
beside a lone fisherman.  Whether their drumming was prompted by
the new age lunacy of Iron John fervor or whether it was actual,
africana or indian, the sounded rich and melancholy in the pinkish
twilight of the still lake as I made my way past the red barn
where we sheltered from the rain, across the stone wall, and home.

<p>

*<u>In my journal I wrote</u>

<p>

<pre>     "The Heron gone for days now. 'It's just the ice
	 I don't like,'
	 said the woman cashier at the Retreat."
</pre>
<p>

*<u>After eating good curry</u>

<p>

a moment of euphoria, followed by the<br>
feeling of loss, missing you boys this day of bridges and men<br>
drumming. (And because I cannot stand it, I call.)
<p>


This morning wake late to cold, clear sunlight the day after steam
begins to fill radiators in this old house making it hard to
breathe or sleep.

<p>

On the way back from my walk, the heron not gone but doubled, a
mirror bird in the mirror pond beyond (I draw in my journal).

<p>

On the walk pumpkin furred caterpiller crosses my path where
yesterday the striped wooly caterpiller also crossed.

<p>

Hornets ceasing on the path, their wings heavy and dull with cold.

<p>

A lone dove flies off into the wood.

<p>

As the girl who keeps the ecological station drives off in her
brown Toyota wagon, bundled in a dark sweatsuit.

<p>

The African woman who lives at the ramshackle student house across
the lane from Rombout keeps a blanket spread out in the sun on her
lawn, day and night; a blue on blue print of stars and beasts
(whales or antelopes I cannot tell from the lane as I walk past).
It may be a beach blanket, I don't know, but she sits there days,
her village as much as this my desk, my screen, mine.

<p>


^not so much confusing as <u>fusing</u>

<p>

"As I begin at the place, it,  I am not certain of the identities
of the "he' and "she" who lie talking in bed...

<p>

"...you can trek across a single place four times, as I did, and
discover that it possesses four radically different meanings each
time. It wasn't until I encountered a place more than twice that I
realized that the words themselves had actually stayed the same

<p>

"each... breathes life into a narrative of possibility which
momentarily obliterates the other possible, but yet to be
actualized, versions of reality.  During my third and fourth
encounters with the same place, the imediate context remains the
same as in the second, what changes is my understanding of the
larger picture of adultery, deceit, and (as another possible
reading suggests) the guilty panic of a man... "<br>

and as substanceless<br>
just the summer and the light<br>
the waiting, everything which is<br>
gone and lost, our sons'<br>
infancies, our dead parents' cigarette smoke<br>
forming the november sunlight<br>
the cars before us and behind<br>
distant Kingston, beautiful women<br>
beautiful men, tender<br>
and swollen flesh, smells<br>
of fish (the Quebecoise angler's<br>
wrapped into a furtive plastic "wallet")<br>
memory in a line of memory<br>
bass from the weed bottom<br>
at pleasant lake, the instant as<br>
green from green swirls up<br>
and smashes the still surface<br>
boys knifing into the slip<br>
as the ferry nears<br>
everything which is<br>
gone and lost, the puffed<br>
swell of labia, ticked<br>
nipple, light wrapped<br>
substanceless sweet light<br>
the meaningless wait<br>
between isle and mainland<br>
along a row of white cottages<br>
gardens of pansies, post office,<br>
chips shops & British woolens<br>
the blast of conditioned air<br>
inside the cushioned buick<br>
diesel ferry, cadet sailors<br>
lovers and strangers at the rail<br>
the slow looping slant of<br>
silver spittle to the distant<br>
surface of the river's roil below<br>
words, sunlight, sweet death<br>
nearing the lost city<br>

<h3>The Card Players</h3>

<p>

<p align=center>
	 <i>Grammatici certant et adhuc<br>
		sub iudice lis est.</i>
	 <br><br>
	 
	 <i>Digo, paciencia y barajar.</i>
<br>
<br> 
			   Rules
</p>
<br>  
	1.   Never play cards with a man
		called Doc.
	
<p>
 
	2.   Jam to-morrow and jam
		yesterday--but never jam
		today.

<p>
	 
	3.   The rules are always subject.

<p>
	 
	4.   Literature's always a good
		card to play.

<p>
	 
	5.   When in doubt, win the trick.
	 

<p>
	
<p>

<p>


	But do they cohere?  A collapse of<br>
	intersections traces the path etched<br>
	in copper intaglio.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	A small shrine freezing behind an<br>
	unused barn.  Pedestal, stupa,<br>
	cracks in stone glint with ice<br>
	intrusions.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Late hour dogs bark--rusted gates<br>
	rankled by squall.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Grandfather clock crowns narrow<br>
	stairs.  Dank house in sequestered<br>
	light.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Avocados and oranges not allowed<br>
	across the border.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Wires triggered by rectangular holes<br>
	in a revolving iron disk.  Chordal<br>
	music spills from antique case.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	In response, I devise my own deck of<br>
	cards.  Composed of paragraphs that<br>
	cartoon when they are flicked.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Gully through the trees auroral at<br>
	dusk with its snow-polished grades of<br>
	rose and kangaroo.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Miniatures spring from one pixelled<br>
	cloud to the next.  Clouds drift<br>
	explicitly with no hand in sight.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	I will sit next to you with a fresh cup<br>
	of tea.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	It was in the cards--fanned,<br>
	distanced into glossy arrays.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Thankful for some consciousness of<br>
	me as I draw cards in the dark.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	On an flickering throne, king<br>
	elevated in alleged control of the<br>
	chaos of letters.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Robe bursting open in electrified<br>
	anticipation.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	A keyhole, in case you need it.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Pair of aces, animated, of<br>
	approximate height.  A store,<br>
	supplies, instant art.  Just add<br>
	water.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	But they do not cohere.  Unlike those<br>
	coated with plastic, when shuffled,<br>
	the edges fray, buckle--unstable in<br>
	transposition.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	As suspected, I was stuck with the<br>
	can of Folgers.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	The way you tell the story, I see<br>
	them at one end of the house eating<br>
	and playing cards while you sit alone<br>
	at the other end.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Shoelaces drop lazily onto an finished<br>
	dais, oiled and uneven.  Are there<br>
	flammable liquids?<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Curled next to me in the stabbing<br>
	dark.  Shampoo fragrance molds itself<br>
	to crease in unseen sheets.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Sun peels ribbons revealing grass<br>
	nested in dissolving stripes of snow.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Palm trees slant, border of parade.<br>
	Miami route iced with skyscrapers,<br>
	colored lights.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Suits reveal full cuts of light.  Long<br>
	limbs intend, protracted and flush,<br>
	contour of serrated shapes.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	A yelp--took every effort of the<br>
	muscles to bring it up.  Shards of<br>
	clock-glass splayed in card player's<br>
	grin.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Metal prongs clap edges of cards that<br>
	slap in succession.  Each image,<br>
	snags, resists--then slides into the<br>
	sputtering blush.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Yes, but were the windows framed<br>
	with ligaments of colored lights?<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Scented but alone you enter your<br>
	chamber of sheep.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	I won't go to bed if you don't ask me.<br>
	This doesn't happen if you're asleep.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Palm trees in emitted flux, flick in<br>
	time to their 8-bit beat.  Desert<br>
	electronic, lurid sands lure<br>
	struggling feet.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Only the fore edges of each card are<br>
	needed; keeping the insert off will<br>
	only require endless overtyping.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Cards spread in a circle of light.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	In the spectered, hollow church,<br>
	scenes of torment char the child-like<br>
	eyes.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	A pimento scarred me once.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Field is carmine, a wazir crawling<br>
	with ease through a rainbow wheel of<br>
	icicles and cloud.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	The "voyage of discovery" incised in<br>
	pastel.  Pencil line precise as long as<br>
	card is not turned.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Identical en visage but one with<br>
	fronds more attenuated.  Vivid<br>
	greens of leaves stirring step.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	The postulant's arrears--brazen<br>
	snapping on the glass table.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Below which is a banner, frayed at<br>
	edges, lacerated tongue.  Scepter<br>
	balanced between two fingers.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Shaky because she is late.  Stockings<br>
	the astronauts touted on the new<br>
	moon of the 8th.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Wild card from the cantina with its<br>
	many supple creases.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Egyptian frond's de-centered light.<br>
	Trey-balancers with perfect pitch.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	I count them--one, two.  Obliged to<br>
	stand side by side in the player's<br>
	hand.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Frond on the crown of the circles of<br>
	addiction.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Tomorrow the card players depart.<br>
	The house a draw except for the<br>
	creak of occasional sleep.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Branched their roots writhing on<br>
	bare rock--etching saffron winter.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Minerals rise from hunger riddled<br>
	tang of acids.  Rings of seclusion<br>
	sting familiar strata.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	The vulnerability that bends in the<br>
	middle when not expected.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Spilling from my hand there are so<br>
	many of them they curl as I try to<br>
	hold on.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Card trick for those for whom<br>
	luxuriant dining has lost its thrill.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	German deuce, the model, hungers<br>
	wide-mouthed.  Der Spiegel on the<br>
	Moroccan throne.<br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Invent a deck to evade the clamor.<br>
	First, vanadium streaks between<br>
	burned trunks.  The second<br>
	completely black.<br>
