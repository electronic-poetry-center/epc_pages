<h3>       sketch #2: point self<br></h3>

	scratch the wall and shoot through.<br>
	focus on the wave and the particle,<br>
	the two sides of us,<br>
	but one the prodigal.<br>
	<br>
	facing all ten directions at once<br>
	we are bound.<br>
	the enclosed point<br>
	reflects a negative universe hoping<br>
	to appeal on the grace of waves:<br>
	the sea a continuous lesson.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	but more often the wavepoints cut us<br>
	without regard.<br>
	<br>
	we fail to notice<br>
	our static nobility: nails<br>
	to secure us in babble.<br>
	<br>
	and stronger, as prime,<br>
	we ride the cosmos:<br>
	matter rescinding,<br>
	silence after excitement.<br>
	<br>
	the study is like that.<br>
	<br>
	other days<br>
	we know our generations<br>
	form the slower wave of existence.<br>
	<br>
	<br>

<h3>       sketch #3: a delicate pursuit<br></h3>
	<br>
	the predators of eden stalk innocence<br>
	       no more sulliled in death:<br>
	pause to tumble in the sun, dreaming of guts<br>
	and the first garden.<br>
	<br>
	while a lamb plays the bait in a tiger's dream of postures --<br>
	the straw dogs are blasted<br>
	<br>
	our bodies blessed by inner cavernity,<br>
	we spin a skin of relation over the implode,<br>
	sinews of mind cohorting the untamed substrate of black crepe<br>
	and the vessel's battle with ease.<br>
	<br>
	to escape the fight,<br>
	we struggle against the rapine of meat<br>
	lifting life second<br>
	by ever blackening second<br>
	by the face of bent time:<br>
	<br>
	shells,<br>
	trapments,<br>
	the environs of life aspire<br>
	to a platform, the roots of a tree<br>
	anchoring possibility,<br>
	the cells of awareness patient --<br>
	stocks for the long inhale of winter,<br>
	<br>
	and the bridal shine of the grave.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<h3>       sketch #4: form as divinity<br></h3>
	<br>
	the dynamic mouthing of words can whorl as in the wood,<br>
	the words, the populace, and even history --	<br>
	but finger nails break in the oven,	<br>
	and flesh plays a traitor in the end.<br>
	<br>
	on this lattice we fix our fate, <br>
	our kingdoms of spirit and form over gas,<br>
	tracing the blood<br>
	squaring the spirals<br>
	marking the emptiness.<br>
	<br>
	are we caged or set free?<br>
	do these pinions allow flight<br>
	or drown us in the sea's complaint?<br>
	<br>
	finally, the gods coalesce to explain volcanoes<br>
	and give order to pain<br>
	as the self did, as language does,<br>
	to soothe the barbarous hunt<br>
	with illusion.<br>
	<br>
	<br>

<h3>       sketch #5: spin<br>
</h3>	<br>
	within the dilution of our thoughts,<br>
	our alloy of manure and speed marks us as both fallen<br>
	and born again --<br>
	from the womb to the light<br>
	and from the light through sentience to surety.<br>
	<br>
	I place the books together,<br>
	wash the dishes and rearrange the dust<br>
	from reminders of person that say nothing<br>
	but too much.<br>
	<br>
	on the clouded shore,<br>
	the books tell me:<br>
	death embodies evil when we conceive the point,<br>
	which is but dual half of us.<br>
	<br>
	I struggle with that mixture.<br>
	<br>
	consider also the wave and energy,<br>
	how matter is consumed with life:<br>
	the raindropping to merge with a pool,<br>
	shifting allegiance in the sway of orders.<br>
	<br>
	that is how the cycle attains highest in our enlightenment.<br>
	<br>
	Brahmma sets the order,<br>
	by act creating is and all that is not.<br>
	the birth begun,<br>
	Vishnu forms a tide<br>
	encased within our linking nets of twine,<br>
	bordered by each spoke of the wheel.<br>
	<br>
	Shiva dances to chaos,<br>
	each word of consciousness dismembered<br>
	from artifact to artifice,<br>
	a drop no longer divisible,<br>
	the motion contained,<br>
	only the concept unstrung<br>
	when Shiva spins creator to destroy.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
 <h3>      sketch #4: double sight<br>
</h3>	<br>
	everyone two faced,<br>
	opening and then closing my fingers,<br>
	we become a facet of Rangda<br>
	to abide the laws of conflict<br>
	our failure an image in a mirror --<br>
	<br>
	closer than skin than self<br>
	the blind time ascendant.<br>
	<br>
	we shimmer<br>
	as his womb colors hope<br>
	her cock a fist of despair,<br>
	trance,<br>
	evoking a passage of points:<br>
	diving through the water veil,<br>
	two world's breathless<br>
	with Rangda incarnate.<br>
	<br>
	the rotten meat plays counterpoint<br>
	to fruit's ripe curve.<br>
	explosions of bamboo accentuate musical logic<br>
	as Rangda will code switch,<br>
	becoming, as we knew she would, the positive self<br>
	on the crest of evolution<br>
	<br>
	strong to the will of the world.<br>
