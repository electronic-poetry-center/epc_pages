Subject: margins of virtuality



OK, so, in fact I'm quite serious when I say       Shang Dynasty China, 2nd
I don't understand the new obsession with cyber-   millenium bc: Diviners ask
space, virtual reality etc given that we've long   questions about the future
had telephones & TVs. OK, of course you'll say:    (spoken) which they then
"But cmptr email = much expanded capacity over     WRITE (read "carve")on the
TV's/telephones" etc BUT my pt. is that we're      plastrons (lower or tummy
talking mainly about (1) STORAGE capacity (mem-    shells, cognate of "plas-
ory) and (2) the WRITTEN word (as vs logo-phal-    ter" & "plastic") of tur-
locentric meaning-self-presenced SPEECH & all      tles; they then ask the
that, right?) (on the phone to yr aunt or what-    "spirits" these questions
ever, i mean). (OK, TV is another thing, we've     and burn the shells in
already got a lot of stuff--graphics plus vir-     specific places: they
tually infinite space etc etc, eg TV news live     "read" answers in terms
from Kabul, Afghansitan where, once you're al-     of the (shapes of the)
ready crossing southeast into Pakistan you can     CRACKS that appear. Thus:
buy hash cookies from the f....g border guards!    "writing" was originally
--with TV which people seem to be conveniently     random cracks generated
forgetting in their new love afair with cmptrs,    "naturally" during rites
but anyway, for the sake of argument I'll for-     of augury, since (1) the
get about TVs)....My question: why this new        oldest Chinese characters
obsession with storage, in so-called cyber-        are those found written
space (if this shit truly exists which i truly     in Shang "oracle bones,"
doubt), of the written word? Because people        & (more to the pt.) (2)
LIKE the "feel" of absence, indefinite defer-      the accepted Chinese
ral etc (as vs self-present logo-phallic "face-    "myth" of writing (cf
to-face" of telephone conversations?), is that     Plato's Thoth-myth in the
it? Because we're in the "post-modern age" and     Phaedrus, Derrida's "P's
all that? You can retrieve old phone conver-       Pharmakon" & etc) says
sations as well, for crissake (assuming they've    the original IDEA of "wri-
been recorded by your local police which in my     ting" came from direct ob-
case is a safe assumption)! & even if you cldn't   servation of nature, of
those old SPOKEN conversations are still there,    the RANDOM or ARBITRARY
my friend, their echos hanging like weary bats     (here we think of a gram-
in the corridors of night (you know, night-yrs     matologized Saussure, per-
of time)....upside down maybe, being echos after   haps) "marks," "lines,"
all....waiting for me/you/us to retrace their      wen-"patterns" (where both
tenuous, INVISIBLE but NOT ERASED (inter)connec-   world & human mind are seen
tions and fathomless (inter)stices, their very     as wen-patterned) in nature
inward-WOUND complexities......within the laby-    --in eg tree bark, birds'
rinthine pipes, the wires within earth. "Oh        wings or feet, turtles'
earthly voice!" Oh (logocentric) wired earth!      shells, phone lines....
