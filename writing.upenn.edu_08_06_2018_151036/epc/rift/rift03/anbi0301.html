Message to Rif/t <br>
September 2, 1994<br>
Robert Anbian<br>


             I was electronically published for the first time<br>
             recently.  I don't know, I didn't really feel any<br>
             different the next morning...<br>
                        - said at a poetry reading, 1994<br>

<p>

     Is the body electric now the network electronic?  (Whitman a
holy avatar of oneness wandering lonely America, or herald of
cyber-flow interconnectedness?  How would Pound have constructed his
cantos had he had hypertext?  Would the Surrealists have found the
Internet marvelous?  Was Richard Kostelanetz merely a body of data
waiting for the net in order to circulate and
find-ever-changing-form?)  That is, is the electric circuit ("energy
is eternal delight"-Blake) of one seemingly discrete body/psyche,
described by the charge going from mind's eye to hand's gesture
(leaving aside for the moment questions of the material of the
gesture's reification) and back to body's eye-and later translated
laterally to other discrete body/psyches-now to be not only
incorporated in an expanding net of lateral transmissions, but
actually subsumed in a circuitry of speech and response amounting, at
least momentarily and provisionally, to a collective corpus of
synchronous expression/impression?  And if this latter proposition is
true, or even true some of the time, wouldn't that lead to some
amelioration of the alienated chauvinist individualism that inhabits
all our attitudes toward body, psyche, and other, and translates so
directly into chauvinisms of nation, race, religion, and other
appurtenances of individual identity?  Isn't this the real social
stake in the ideology/praxis of the network?

<p>

     (Wait a minute, haven't we been down this road before?
Telegraph-oh Mayakovsky-radio, TV...what sorts of connections have
they created-everyone knows the theme from "Twilight Zone"?-and what
kinds of alienations have they erected/re-enforced-is a telephone call
or a letter more "personal"?-and haven't they principally been the
means to more efficiently organize the mass of people as passive
object rather than self-aware subject precisely for chauvinist
adventures and persecutions?  Didn't the radio "love" Hitler?  Didn't
the TV "love" Ronald Reagan?  But the computer network above all
promises interactivity, precisely the instrument-it is said-to reverse
the objectifying and pacifying flow of existing electronic media and
thereby complete their circuits and fulfill their liberatory
potentials.  Cyber-Marxism?  Wait a minute..."the working class" now sees
itself as "the consumer."  What does this mean for all synthesizing
propositions based on the social progressiveness of material advances
in the means of production, increasingly regarded as the means of
expression, or most accurately the means of production of expression?
[This last not a quibble since the man/woman on a literal soapbox is
totally irrelevant, that is, soundless.])

<p>

     What I'm really trying to ask fellow writers in Rif/t: do they
locate the on-line computer at the site of lateral transmissions
(having to do primarily with audience and dissemination) or do they
locate it in the original circuit of creation/composition (having to
do with the aesthetic forms/values of the work of art itself)?  And if
the latter, how precise can they be about the value-transformations
that are emerging from this new means of production of expression?

<p>

     Rif/t, in its various explications of purpose and intent,
wisely eschews cyber-utopianism, but seems to raise questions
concerning the on-line computer's place in artistic composition in a
way that %believes in% the disembodied space "imaged" by the network.
There can be no doubt that there already are, and will be many more,
artistic works originating exclusively from the means of expression of
the computer, and existing exclusively in the "space" of the network.
These works will be either new kinds of works, breaking with past
conceptions of art, or continuations by other means of old kinds of
work, or most likely, syntheses of these two propositions.  But out of
what material conditions will the answers really arise?

<p>

     My own concerns are mundane, are in fact centered in the body,
in the body's actual experience, rather than in cyber-space.  My
concerns have to do with the rigidity of the body and fixedness of the
eye in front of the computer machine.  This physical rigidity far
exceeds that imposed by previous "writing machines," such as the
typewriter where eye and head movement, physical adjustments of the
apparatus, even, in the case of manual typewriters, the varying
rhythmic weight of fingers thumping keys-expressed in the sound of the
armature striking and the weight of the typed letter on the page-not
only preserved but required a field of physical action that recalled
the writer to his body, the site of his active being.  Even in regards
to TV, which requires a fixedness of body and eye exponentially
greater than that called for by movies projected in theatres-which not
only require moving butt to theatre, but also calls for the eye to
roam over a large screen to get the picture, and thus to recall itself
in the act of viewing-the computer requires an almost complete
immobility of the eye.  (Book reading, to make another comparison,
requires great sagas of eye travel, which is greatly aided by our
tendency to shift the book around.)  Over time this immobility weakens
the eye-actually reduces its potential-and one may wonder if there
isn't a corresponding effect on the psyche, and especially on that
element we call imagination.  (Recall the relation of Rapid Eye
Movement to dreaming.)

<p>

     My concerns also have to do with the fact that the physical
set-up of the computer, like the TV, depends upon rows of lights
flashing at subliminal intervals directly into the eye, thus embodying
exactly the most common mechanism of hypnosis, and that viewers of TV
and computer screens are, therefore, in passive hypnotic-suggestive
states that tend to preclude the transformation to self-aware subject
regardless of the content on screen.  Not for nothing is TV the mother
of all advertising mediums, which has little to do with the rational
content of TV commercials.  Not for nothing do we tend to remember the
most irrational elements presented on the tube, while
"educational"-that is, rationally communicated-elements evidently go
down the brain drain.  (We remember how Kennedy and Nixon looked, not
what they said.)

<p>

     I am also concerned with the fact that computer logic itself
is rigid, angular, even, we should say, linear, even if multi-linear
(all the spokes on a wheel are straight lines).  (To this problem,
"fuzzy logic" is, at best, a fuzzy answer.)  In my day job editing a
film magazine, I see in the many publications and other printed matter
that come across my desk how the design capabilities of computers and
certain software programs are driving not only the graphic design that
is actually done, but are reshaping what people regard as "good" and
"sophisticated" design.  In this case, the almost limitless
possibilities for graphic design suggested by a pencil and pad, and
maybe a box of crayons or color markers, is being rigorously channeled
and conventionalized by the use of the computer and its menu-driven
script.  What presents itself on one end as an increase in the ability
to realize design conceptions, presents itself at the other end as a
constriction of the freedom to conceptualize designs.  One may well
argue that while this is true for the strata of amateurs whom the
computer is allowing, for the first time, to design at all (the
computer being in this case, at least initially, liberatory), this is
not likely true for the design professional whose trained
imagination-and ability to sketch-merely incorporates the computer as
a sophisticated tool, or as one of many platforms-including
sketching-for conceptualizing.  I hope this is true.  But such is the
pervasiveness of hypnotic-suggestive electronic media, and the habits
of mind it inculcates, that I wonder if professionals in any field are
as much above the tides of common conditioning as they might hope.


<p>
     This brings me back in another form to my simple-headed
question concerning practice: Do most design professionals still sit
with pencil and pad and sketch their ideas and then go to the computer
to elaborate, refine, and realize, or do they begin at the computer?
I'm suggesting this question, however simple-headed, is extremely
important.  (Recently I saw a documentary, "N is a Number" by George
Csiscery, about Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdo"s who roams the world
collaborating with colleagues in the search for "elegant" solutions to
difficult mathematical problems.  Interestingly enough, Erdos and
colleagues, who occupy the mathematical high ground of creativity and
research, are never seen working at computers.  In fact, they walk in
parks, they talk, they scratch lines in the dirt, draw shapes on bits
of paper, mark equations on blackboards.  Bodily motion-one
mathematician is a juggler who says he gets his most creative insights
while juggling-seems essential to their creative praxis, as is
conversation, physical proximity, physical space and, we might say, a
certain environmental harmony.  The example of one of the century's
foremost circles of mathematicians having arisen from a gathering in a
city park still looms large in the minds of mathematicians.  In this
film they even say, in effect: "Oh no, we never do that on
computers...computers are for the tedious number-crunchings needed to
prove or disprove hypotheses...but for coming up with hypotheses we
need to walk, talk, scratch in the dirt."  Even juggle.  Very
interesting, given a rough parallelism between research mathematicians
and, say, poets.  If, in such a technical field, the most creative
minds are alive to the need to preserve and even extend the body as
the site of creativity, in clear contradistinction to the realm of
computers, it is odd that creative writers and artists would not be
even clearer on the matter.  But, in fact, one hears almost nothing.)

<p>

     My proposition and bias, then, is that the qualities and
values of artistic work that are originated on computer, or are born
within computer networks, will be determined more by the conditions
imposed on the body by computer use than by actual or theoretical
possibilities of cyber-space itself.  It follows that the reception of
works of art on computer, regardless of the site of origination, will
be similarly determined.  These determining conditions, as I have
enumerated them, are rigidity, angularity, linearity, and a
hypnotic-suggestiveness that may preclude the full play of the
creative imagination.  If so, then the computer is simply another,
though exponential, step in the relentless mechanization of humanity
initiated by industrialization, and the computer's potential to
contradict this "meaning" of all industrial machines-ultimately
transforming that meaning into its opposite, that is, turn machines
into tools that help us humanize ourselves-will prove as spectral as
all past technology-based models of liberation.

<p>

     My overarching concern, then, is that one hears very little
about the effect of the physical conditions of computer use on the
work that is being done on them.  We hear about carpal tunnel syndrome
and loss of eye focusing power in relation to constant, repetitive use
of computers in "cyber-sweatshops," but never in relation to people's
mental capacities or states of mind, especially in creative work.
(Though I recently read that electro-magnetic fields may play a
significant role in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease.)  (Recall
the opening chapters of Jerry Mander's "Four Arguments for the
Elimination of Television," where he summarizes what was known up to
that point about the physical effect of TV-watching on brain-wave
states.  Others more in tune to cyber-discourse may have
recommendations for further reading.)

<p>

     In my own experience, my entirely portable and accessible-
under-all-conditions 4" x 6" sketch pad, which I fill with odd lines,
drafts of poems, sketches, doodles, notations of fact, questions for
further review, etc., remains for me the least-mediated, most plastic,
hence freest space (I would almost say "purest" in the sense that
there is no apparatus but that of the imagination) available to me for
the conception of original works, and the space in which I feel the
greatest connection to the action of the work itself.  Thus I still
compose first drafts of poems and stories in long hand.  I notice I
need to doodle as I think; that my mind creates its pace by means of
the idle or purposeful motions of my hand, which needs to feel free to
move in all directions.  Not even the final published work gives me
the same sense of its organic (created by an organic being) nature.  I
have never felt this sense of connection with the work (with myself?)
on computer, though I have worked quite a lot on computer for a number
of years.  Of course, all this may be just an individual's habit and
prejudice.  It is true that under deadline pressure I have taken to
composing my journalistic-that is, linear and expository-works
directly on computer.  But I have learned to always always revise
these pieces, and also proof poems and stories revised on computer, in
hard copy.  When I go to the hard copy I almost always find strange
lapses of sense and structure-or just plain loopy oversights and
lacunae-that I attribute to that strung-out waking-sleeping state I
get during extended periods of working at a computer.

<p>

     (However, when I first heard about Rif/t from co-editor
Glazier, I was immediately excited by the possibilities for flux,
continuity, and multiplicity in the presentation of literary texts
that would seem to be distinctive to the computer network.  I had been
at work, and still am, on several cycles of poems all carrying the
same title, "We."  The repetition of the title on each poem and cycle
of poems, with its simple and complex denotations and connotations,
was meant to signal the breaking down of linear progression, of the
idea of the discrete work of art, and even, to a degree, of the idea
of the discrete author.  The poetry itself features sudden shifts in
tone and meaning, juxtapositions of intimate and public language,
quotation and "off-quotation" from various, and various kinds of,
sources.  I have even considered opening the series to other poets to
write pieces for which the only rule would be they read the existing
poems and title their poem "We" [an idea for which the net would seem
to be the perfect instrument].  For reasons having to nothing to do,
at least consciously, with the conceptual world of computers, and
everything to do with my own perceptions vis a vis literature and
society, I had taken this tack in an effort to approach a meta-
language that would reclaim some collective and public space from the
suffocating strictures of individualism [which have perhaps found
their most oppressive expression today in the cult of the artist, the
cult of the poet].  So I saw a natural marriage of my own aesthetic
aims with the praxis of Rif/t.  [At least one "We" poem appeared in
Rif/t version 1.0; an entire series should appear in the next _City
Light's Review_])

<p>

     So it seems we may already be at least half-asleep at the
screen-though we may be convinced we are wide-awake-forgetting our own
bodies as the site of experience in the rush into cyber-space.  It's
important to remember, after all, that the Luddites weren't wrong
about machines.  They only lost the argument.
