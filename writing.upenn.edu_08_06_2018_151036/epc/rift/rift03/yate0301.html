      Part of not writing poetry has to do with
exploring print making, learning to handle materials
which were not intellectual but physical.  the other
part of the change of focus away from writing poetry
has to do with electronic writing. I cannot tell if this
discussion is merely my lack of ability to content with
the fact that living has little to do with lyrical poetry. 
Since the forum I wanted to be in to talk about writing
poetry did not exist or could not exist given my
inability to locate what that forum might consist of, I
turned first back to letter writing as a way of working
through a poem in conversation.  I found that the
poem as letter did not communicate the kind of
information, "common knowledge" I needed to
survive, nor did the letter satisfy my desire for writing
"poetry" (the kind of writing which deters syntax,
becomes sound communicates meaning outside of
analogous juxtaposition to.)  E-mail correspondence
came about as an antidote to this loneliness, this lack
of a place to talk about writing.  It provided access to
continuous dialogue in writing which has changed my
idea of why I write a poem.

<p>
      Compared to keyboard chatter, the constant
mumblings between writers about the conditions of
their material lives (my case) or about the conditions
of their intellectual lives (the case of the poetics
listserv I belong to) a poem is an abstraction, a vanity
(vacuity).  A poem does not speak as quickly and as
unconcernedly as electronic writing.  It is anomalous
(and therefore interesting) to bring poetry and our
concerns about it into a place which is unlike the
conditions under which one tends to think or write. 
Electronic space changes my idea of process.  It
alerted me to the fact that meaning must be made in
this kind of writing.

<p>
      There is a problem, not a sentimental one, in
electronic writing, the lack of physicality and the
tendency for oblique discussion.  You do not feel the
waver in someone's voice, exhaustion, fear in
electronic writing.  Yet, for me, it does often substitute
for intimate dialogue located, at least, around a
concern for poetry.

<p>
      I felt that the starkness, the raw emotionality of
electronic writing would be "good" for writing poetry
but I found that it took away from my need to write a
poem.  When there was the possibility of talking
through emotions constantly, via what we were
learning on the VAX, there was no place (and actually
no time) for writing a poem.  In many ways, the
constant availability of contact on electronic mail took
the place of the pathos which may have otherwise
gone into elaborating a poem.

<p>
      Because electronic space is a writing space, I
realized that a poem might merely (miserably) be my
way of talking through living.  Maybe I did not have
aspirations to write a poem.  In my correspondences
via electronic mail I could satisfy immediately the
problem of "describing to" which I realize is the nature
of my poetry.

<p>
      It is important when considering the specific
instances of poets writing in electronic space to factor
in an immanent speed of dissolve.  To characterize
myself as a writer I say: someone how feels more
comfortable in the awkwardisms of written language
than the awkwardisms of spoken language--that I
would rather, in many ways, deal with the pertinent
issues of my life through writing or that I can't live
otherwise.  If I don't write, I cannot contain the
extremes of what I recognize minute to minute,
cannot absorb the coldness of contradiction.

<p>
      The distance between the material world of
writing and electronic space has impacted my ideas
about what to write in a poem.  When a writer has
limitless access to writing which is "interactive," her
relationship to writing is going to change.  For the
most part I think my writing since spending
considerable time on-line (*Dark far though clasps
Daisy root and 2.10-3.28_*) has become language-
based.  What I do is contend with the quantity of
writing that I am involved with: personal and
intellectual.  These poems mediate between the lack
of physicality in an electronic experience and the
mundane sensuality of regular living, of regular time
and slow place of experience.
      Perhaps my major effort in combining the work
of print making with writing is trying to reconcile the
awkwardness of experience with the illusion of
technology.  The effect of working between mediums
is a distinct awareness of what happens when you
write a letter in electronic mail and when you write
into the treads of a print.  I have an intuitive sense
that what is being said and dealt with in the print
studio and in electronic space is not vastly different
but the process, the steps one takes to write in
electronic mail and the steps it takes to make a print
alter what it is possible to say and to see
simultaneously.
      Electronic writing changed what I thought
writing was for.  It decreased my need to isolate
myself and write.  I am composing in a space that
isn't solitary.  As a poet I can no longer claim there
isn't a place for my work.  Now there is always a
place.  The question is still how to address it: to what
extent can one's written exchanges, postings, retain
the value, the tone of a distinction I still make,
between writing and writing poetry?
