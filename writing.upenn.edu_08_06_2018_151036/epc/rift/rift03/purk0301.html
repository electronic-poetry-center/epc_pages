<p>
Purkinge (pur kin gee) fiber:  any of the specialized cardiac fibers forming 
a network in the ventricular walls that conduct electric impulses responsible
for the contractions of the heart to all parts of the ventricular muscles.
Named for JE Purkinge (1787-1869). 


<p>

	"Everybody understands what is meant by 'the word'...It is
	interwoven with the threads, it fills the interstices in the
	fabric..." 


<p>

Purkinge--emanating from the ashes of Awopbop collective--improvisationally
rends and resews texts in printed and oral forms, producing a particularly
angular "writing" "centered" from different perspectives. The group invents 
and promotes new modes of authorship and anti-authorship, blooming melodic
conversations in opposition to a system grown entropic. In our experiments,
enabled by technology, we insist on the necessity of interactive,
intercorporeal communication. 

<p>

"Myopic Village" was composed using the Daedalus software which enables up to 2
dozen people to simultaneously work on the composition of a text together in
real time.  Purkinge composes on this system & improvises on 4-track recording
equipment.
