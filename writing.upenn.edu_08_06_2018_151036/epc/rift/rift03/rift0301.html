<h3>117</h3>

For this narrator at least, owing to the cosmic force
of the post-code book,things no longer fall apart.  But
this is not the half; look again.  He looked at me in
pure Hungarian.  Its members: "river," "wrangling,"
"grazes," "bow,", "stringing animal," "river's poison,"
and "dust."  The reader may, perhaps, be surprised,
that instead of endeavoring to revive the patient, the
learned gentlemen should fall immediately into a
dispute on the occasion of his death; but in reality,
all such experiments had been made before their
arrival: for the captain was put into a warm bed, had
his veins scarified, his forehead chafed, and all sorts
of strong drops applied to his lips and nostrils.  The
inhumanity of exchange-value is to be exponentially
multiplied in a kind of ecstatic but ironic orgasm over
the indifferent ways  of alienation.  When he's reached
pure abstraction he's going to take up architecture. 
*June 9*--The Minister of Police informs M. de Coulmier
that he may inform the interested party that the
Emperor, in meetings of the Privy Council of April 19
and May 3, has decided to continue Sade's detention. 
The thought that I had done some damage to my
employer's Ford was, of course, most alarming and I had
quickly brought the vehicle to a halt.  The steps of
the shrine were thronged with kneeling pilgrims, and
Vivaldi, to avoid singularity, kneeled also; till a
high peal of the organ, at a distance, and the deep
voices of choristers announced that the first mass was
begun.  I was  a tad mogadonic, but that was on account
of being poo-scared.  At times, without recognizing
each other, men would embrace as they passed in the
darkness and would then rush to do their job, with
their muscles both excited and softened by that single
caress.  Furthermore, a materialist reading of Hegel
allows us to think this negativity as the trans-
subject, trans-ideal, and trans-symbolic movement found
in the *separation of matter*, one of the preconditions
of symbolicity, which generates the symbol as if
through a leap--but never merges with it or with its
opposite logical homologue.  He was not a great walker,
but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin - a
pastime for which the wea persistency not allowed for in 
Isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate; 
and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the 
measure of her gratified eagerness, they took a boat on 
the river, the dear little river, as Isabel called it, 
where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the
foreground of the landscape; or drove over the country in 
a phaeton - a low capacious, thick-wheeled phaeton formerly
much used by Mr. Touchett, but which he had now ceased to
enjoy.  "Some Memories of Pre-Dada: Picabia and
Duchamp" (1949), in _The Dada Painters and Poets: An
Anthology_, ed. Robert Motherwell (New York: George
Wittenborn, Inc., 1951), p. 261.  Soon Canterel stopped
with his finger extended towards the interior of the
cage, pointing to the large cylindrical object made of
dark metal, which measured about two feet in diameter
by five feet high.  He was caught off balance, he couldn't 
disguise it.  This was a Sukhanovka method--also used in 
Archangel, where the interrogator Ivkov applied it in 1940.  
They sat devouring cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes in a 
waterfront place full of refugees from the fighting up the 
hill, all their eyes, including ones that had wept, now 
lighted from inside--was it only the overhead fluorescents, 
some trick of the sun and water outside? no. . . too many of 
these fevered lamps not to have origin across the line
somewhere, in a world sprung new, not even defined yet,
worth the loss of nearly everything in this one.  Of
course, here I am picking out the dominant traits of a
period.

	So far as I can ascertain from anatomical works at present available,
the origin of the semitendinosus in the Raven seems to be, at least, quite
an uncommon one.  Speaking of it for the Apteryx, it" thornier   pins and
needles   sew after dark   thriid a needle   the needle pricks   by the
prick    of their needles   O the needles   invite tide   trickle tickle
