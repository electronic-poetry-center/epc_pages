"Martinique is not a Polynesian island," writes the Carib
bean writer and generally astute postcolonial theorist, Edouard 
Glissant, thereby doing unto Polynesia what he (no doubt rightly) 
claims others do to the Caribbean islands.  "This is, however, 
the belief of so many people who, given its reputation, would 
love to go there for pleasure" (1).  Yet the joke Glissant next 
reports hearing from a Martinican political figure would strike a 
chord for many residents of Hawaii who know better than to subscribe to the
Visitors' Bureau portrayal of the state as an 
untroubled tourist paradise; "in the year 2100, tourists would be 
invited by satellite advertisement to visit this island and gain 
firsthand knowledge of 'what a colony was like in past centuries'" (1).  Up
until 1959, the year Hawaii became a state, it 
was a U.S. colony; many would argue that it still is.  
 Hawaii's dependent economy, whose focus has recently shifted 
almost entirely to tourism, makes it more like than unlike Glissant's
Martinique.  The link between Hawaii and the Caribbean 
is--perhaps unbeknownst to Caribbeans--also cultural; Jawaiian 
music, or reggae performed by Hawaii musicians, affirms the 
(perhaps one-sided) emotional link between island regions; shortly after I
arrived in Hawaii four years ago, I was astonished to 
hear a band of Hawaiian musicians singing earnestly about "the 
lost children of Africa."  Bob Marley's melodies, and many of his 
political sentiments, can frequently be heard over Hawaii's 
airwaves, and one group, Roots Natty Roots, writes lyrics in 
Jamaican and not Hawaiian dialect.
<p>
 Hawaii's culture, like that of Caribbean nations, is mixed: 
here the influences are Asian and European, indigenous and African (insofar as
American culture is African American).  Ronald 
Takaki argues that "we can be certain that much of our society's 
future will be influenced by which 'mirror' we choose to see 
ourselves" (17).  Thus Hawaii is seen increasingly as a model for 
the multiculture that is developing in California and throughout 
the United States, but the history of that multiculturalism is 
replete with ironies similar to those found in the Caribbean.  
For sugar planters imported workers from many different cultures, 
not in order to bring them together in harmony, but to create a 
rather primitive system of "checks and balances."  As Takaki, who 
himself grew up in Hawaii, reports: "The employers were systematically
developing an ethnically diverse labor force in order to 
create division among their workers and reinforce management 
control" (252).  
 Because Hawaii is a creole society, one can justifiably 
translate Edward Kamau Brathwaite's description of Jamaica onto 
the Hawaiian context: "'Creole' . . . presupposes a situation 
   where the society concerned is caught up 'in some kind of colonial
arrangement' with a metropolitan European power, on the one 
hand, and a plantation arrangement on the other; and where the 
society is multiracial but organized for the benefit of a minority of European
origin" (xv).  Only when it became clear that 
members of these various nationalities shared a grudge against 
the planters did they begin to join together in unions, rather 
than each striking on their own.  The banding together of different ethnic
groups in unions was also a first step toward changing 
the linguistic balance of power in Hawaii; Hawaiian pidgin (an 
amalgam of English, Hawaiian, and Asian languages) grew out of 
the planters' need to communicate demands to their workers.  More 
recently, however--and within the last 15 years, for the most 
part--Hawaiian pidgin has been used in literature as a language 
of difference and of resistance against the "mainland" or "dominant" culture of
the United States.  Hawaii's literature has 
increasingly been written in pidgin, following the example of 
Milton Murayama's All I Asking for is My Body, originally self-published in
1975, a coming-of-age book about plantation life 
leading up to the Second World War.  
<p>
 This "local" pidgin literature transmits many facets of 
local culture more accurately than could standard English, which 
students use in school.  The African writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o 
explains the significance of these two languages in another 
similar context: "Thus a specific culture is not transmitted 

through language in its universality but in its particularity as 
the language of a specific community with a specific history.  
Written literature and orature are the main means by which a 
particular language transmits the images of the world contained 
in the culture it carries" (15).  Ngugi's emphasis on "orature" 
dovetails with Glissant's contention that local Caribbean literatures
participate in a movement back from literate to oral 
cultures.  "I am not far from believing that the written is that 
universalizing influence of Sameness," he writes, "whereas the 
oral would be the organized manifestation of Diversity," or 
multiculturalism.  The literature of Hawaiian pidgin might well 
be described as an "orature," especially since standard English 
is the language of the schools and of business, pidgin that of 
social and cultural interchanges.  
   
<p>  The writing of what is called "local literature" is, at 
least ostensibly, a form of resistance against Literature itself.  
Just as Ngugi's son once thought that daffodils might be something like "little
fish in a lake" (in Harlow 37), Darrell Lum 
humorously relates his difficulties as a child relating to elements of the myth
of Thanksgiving--its brown leaves, Puritan 
black hats, and Indians whose side he rather thinks he would 
take.  As Ngugi writes in his essay "The Language of African 
Literature," "Learning, for a colonial child, became a cerebral 
activity and not an emotionally felt experience" and "the child 
was now being exposed exclusively to a culture that was a product 
of a world external to himself" (17).  While Hawaii students have 
no patent on disinterest in English or American literature, some 
of their reasons for disinterest are, I think, different from 
those of students (especially white students) in other places 
I've taught.
<p>
 Lois-Ann Yamanaka writes poetry exclusively in pidgin; it is 
no accident that her first book is also published on tape, and 
that her Honolulu readings attract up to several hundred listeners, for hers is
a spoken, not a written, language.  Her speakers 
are, in the main, adolescent girls who live in an intensely 
"local" world infiltrated by the larger national culture.  In her 
poems, standard English is not a desirable language for self-expression but
becomes an upper-class affectation or power play; 
it is, to twist J.L. Austin's term, a "speech act" in which the 
speaker puts on the language as she might put on clothes, or 
make-up, or a friend.  In "Tita: Boyfriends," Yamanaka has Tita 
describe her use of standard English to a linguistically less-sophisticated
friend.  The effect of these few phrases of standard English in the poem (and in
Yamanaka's work generally) is 
one of estrangement; the language sounds affected, strained, and 
above all out of place, especially when she reads it aloud:
   <p>
  Richard wen' call me around 9:05 last night.<br>
 Nah, I talk real nice to him.<br>
 Tink I talk to him the way I talk to you?<br>
 You cannot let boys know your true self.<br>
<br>

 Here, this how I talk.<br>
 Hello, Richard.  How are you?<br>
 Oh, I'm just fine.  How's school?<br>
 My classes are just greeaat.<br>
 Oh, really.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.<br>
 Oh, you're so funny.<br>
 Yes, me too, I love C and K.<br>
 Kalapana?  Uh-huh, uh-huh. (42)<br>
She then tells her friend how to make herself appealing to boys; 
the pun on "act" is crucial because it makes clear that the 
language of feeling (pidgin) is distinct from an artificial 
language of putting on airs to impress others:<p>
 
 'cause you dunno how<br>
 for make your voice all nice,<br>
 your face all make-up,<br>
 your hair all smooth and ehu,<br>
 your clothes all low cut,<br>
 and your fingernails all long.<br>
 You dunno how for act.<br>
 And you, you just dunno how for please.  (43)<br>

 Yamanaka's speakers share the prejudices of plantation life, 
where even the layout of the sewage system emphasized a racial 
hierarchy.  She (not her characters!) has been criticized by 
members of the Filipino community, for example, for poems like 
the first in her collection, "Kala Gave Me Anykine Advice Especially About
Filipinos When I Moved to Pahala," which include the 
stereotype of Filipino men (most of whom camp to Hawaii as 
bachelors) as sexual predators:
<p>
 No clip your toenails at night.<br>
 And no wear tight jeans or<br>
 Felix going follow you home with his blue Valiant<br>
 when you go plantation camp side past<br>
 the big banyan tree, past the sugar mill,<br>
 past the pile of bagasse, down your dirt road.<br>

(The mock-up historical plantation in Waipahu, on Oahu, does 
nothing to downplay such stereotypes; the Filipino house contains 
a myriad of photos of sultry looking European actresses, whereas 
the Portuguese house has pictures of Jesus and the Japanese 
Buddhist house a modest altar.  My guide, on showing us a Chinese 
religious area, termed them "superstitious.")  Tita's advice, 
later in the book, concerns "Japs" and reveals the internalized 
prejudice of a local Japanese adolescent (the term "local Japanese" refers to an
American of Japanese descent who grew up in 
Hawaii):
<p>
 I wish I had double eye.  [like Caucasians]<br>
<br>
 I tell you, my next birtday,<br>
 when my madda ask me what I like,<br>
 I going tell her I like go Honolulu<br>
 for get one double eye operation.  (33)<br>
<br>

 Everywhere in the book plantation life mimics "dominant" 
American culture.  As Glissant writes, "The pressure to imitate 
is, perhaps, the most extreme form of violence that anyone can 
inflict on a people; even more so when it assumes the agreement 
(and even, the pleasure) of the mimetic society.  This dialectic, 
in fact, suppresses this form of violence under the guise of 
pleasure" (46).  Especially prevalent in Yamanaka's world is the 
popular music of the 1960s and 1970s: in a poem set in the girls' 
room, Tita describes "one new Edgar Winter book cover"; in "Tita: 
User," she says angrily, "I no mo your Donny Osmond 8-track. / I 
hate Down by the Lazy Riva. / And I no mo your Captain and Te-
nille tape either, / so get off it"; in "Prince PoPo, Prince 
JiJi," the speaker says, "Us, we eat our corn beef hash patties 
with rice / and watch Ed Sullivan"; Elton John music plays a part 
in "Empty Heart"; and another poem is entitled, "My Eyes Adore 
You."  This last song becomes important in the story of a young 
girl's first sexual experience; her friend, WillyJoe, translates 
a line of the song into pidgin, "My eye adore you," as he croons 
to her in his yellow Datsun (evidence of another kind of colonialism).

<p> Yamanaka's poems pull no punches; typically, they tell 
stories of sexual and verbal abuse from the point of view of 
adolescent girls.  Again, however, one needs to hear the poems as 
well as read them.  The most effective piece, to my mind, is 
"Parts," a poem I've heard her read on more than one occasion.  
It is organized according to body parts--the brain, the face, the 
eye, the nostril, the foot, the mouth, the ass, the crack.  At 
each of the readings, the audience laughs at the first one or two 
sections of the poem; part of the laughter has to do with the 
fact of the poem's being in pidgin (an idea that is still new to 
local listeners who went to school to Robert Frost and other 
canonical Americans).  Part is a reaction to the dramatic language of the pidgin
speaker:
<p>
 I get one<br>
 splitting <br>
 headache.<br>
 No ask me questions.<br>
 And no move.<br>
 First one <br>
 who breathe<br>
 going get <br>
 one good whack<br>
 with the fly swatter.<br>  
 You.  Cook the rice.<br>
 You.  Fry some spam.  (65)<br>
(A mainland audience might laugh at the reference to spam, which 
is a popular foodstuff in the islands; the laughter here has 
nothing to do with the food, an honest part of the local diet.)  
At some point in the litany, however, the audience falls into an 
ashamed silence.  The voice--it is a mother's voice--gets louder 
and more abusive, until words threaten to spill over into actual 
violence.  The poem's final section presents "advice from a 14-
year old friend" who counsels drug use as an antidote to psychic 
pain.  The audience's discomfort comes from the way in which the 
poem forces it to participate in verbal abuse by finding the 
rhetoric amusing; the child's pain is thus met both with empathy 
and with horror at having participated in that abuse by taking it 
so lightly.
<p>
 "The grass is green and tall / like amber wave of grain, 
cept green" (95) says a girl who has fled her violently abusive 
mother and gone for solace to a friend, Bernie, who runs a taxidermy shop (a
shop that shows up frequently in the poems).  The 
poem ends with the girl looking down on the plantation camp and 
her house: "Real small. / So small, I cover everything with my 
hands / and no see nothing at all" (96).  These references to 
"America the Beautiful" and, less evidently, to "The Star-Spangled Banner,"
which depends so on the trope of seeing far, emphasize the strangeness, even
inappropriateness of the American myth 
to Hawaii's plantation life.  Fascinating then, to see that 
Yamanaka's work has caught on not only in Hawaii, but also on the 
mainland; Yamanaka has been widely published nationally.  Strange 
also to remark that she has been in some hot water at home, not 
only for using ethnic stereotypes in her work (the idea of the 
unreliable narrator is not universally accepted!), but also for 
the pungency of her language and the sexual violence described in 
the poems.  Yamanaka, who herself teaches intermediate school 
students and reads frequently to classes around the state, has 
been asked to submit lists of her work that she intends to read, 
so that administrators can request that she not read certain 
poems.  Certainly some of this may be simple prudery--and the 
poems are strong--but much of it ironically engages a mechanism 
of power that is attempting to perpetuate itself, and silence a 
local language that has often been officially censored in the 
past.  Behind Yamanaka's loud voices, though, are the sounds of 
reason and tolerance aiming to make their way through the din, as 
I hope school administrators, teachers, and students will soon 
realize.
<p>
 Whatever the thematic limitations of Yamanaka's work, and I 
confess to a certain weariness with her adolescent speakers, it 
engages crucial issues, not just for Hawaii, but for the nation 
as it reluctantly becomes a multicultural society.  The pain of 
this transformation--pain that is often self-inflicted--culminates in Saturday
Night at the Pahala Theatre, in a narrative 
about lovers who burn their own names on their backs with 
sparklers.  After this act of curiously self-affirming mutual 
mutilation, in which words do literally become flesh, the female 
speaker has the book's last words.  Surely this act reflects the 
ambivalences of pidgin speakers toward writing; if the act of 
naming has traditionally belonged to a cultural elite (such as 
teachers), then the act of self-naming is especially difficult 
and painful.  But the last lines of the poem are most assuredly 
spoken, not written:  
<P>  
   I IS.<br>
 Ain't nobody<br>
 tell me<br>
 otherwise. (140)<br>
I would not go so far as Glissant in imagining that we can here 
see "a kind of revenge by oral language over written ones, in the 
context of a global civilization of the nonwritten" (126).  The 
new orality, if it can be so termed, is also largely controlled 
by the old powers that be (talking computers and MTV come to 
mind).  But Yamanaka's fresh and honest and spoken poetry is 
important to Hawaii in its assertion of a local identity separate 
from the national one.  It may also help teach others outside 
Hawaii about the pleasures and the pains of multicultural experience.<P>

 And then there was the time<br>
 when you just joked coming<br>
 up to me, laid your wrist on<br>

 and, what was more to the point, done so<br>

   John Ashbery, "Dinosaur Country"   <br>

<br>
 John Ashbery has, for several decades now, opened his work 
up to a multitude of voices, although they all ultimately belong 
to him, or to his voice, or (at the least) to a loosely defined 
linguistic behavior that might be called Ashberian.  I would like 
to think that the success of Yamanaka's poems on the mainland 
(not here, where Ashbery is, at best, ignored) is to some extent 
due to Ashbery's strong lead block.  But I find it more interesting to brood on
another question: how can a reading of Yamanaka 
shed light on Ashbery's work?  In what ways does her work open 
his up to interpretation?  Can we think of Ashbery, like Yamanaka, as an
"ethnic" voice, a participant in American multiculturalism?

<p> The answer is yes.  I read Ashbery's latest volume, And the 
Stars Were Shining (at least in certain moods) as a colonial 
allegory, manipulated by Ashbery to his own ends.  This allegory 
reads as follows: a famous American poet, wishing to write about 
his own inevitable decline and fall, uses his own position as an 
intellectual well-versed in European art, music and literature, 
to tell his story.  The decline of the west is embodied (or 
disembodied) in the poet's decadence (or belatedness).  In so 
doing, he reveals the extent to which Americans are still colonized by Europe,
even as Europe ingests large quantities of 
American culture.  And so Ashbery appropriates his own appropriation: "What! Our
culture in its dotage! / Yet this very poem 
refutes it," he proclaims.  He becomes an odd colonist of the 
   colonial.

<p> Ashbery's favorite trope is operatic; the title of his book, 
for starters, comes from Puccini's Tosca, though it may also pun 
on the star-spangled banner.  But Ashbery's operatic allegory is 
apparently different from Edward Said's.  In writing of Verdi's 
Aida, Edward Said argues that "Aida, like the opera form itself, 
is a hybrid and radically impure work that belongs equally to the 
history of culture and to the historical experience of overseas 
domination," further, that "the embarrassment of Aida is finally 
that it is not so much about but of imperial domination" (114).  
Apparently different, that is, unless the decline of western 
culture is somehow synonymous with its power.  Western cultural 
power manifests itself first in its most decadent form, or so I 
thought recently when I looked off an ancient city wall in Xian, 
China and caught sight of a large KFC billboard.  Or when I 
turned on my hotel TV and discovered MTV and CNN.  In the postcolonial world,
there is often no way to tell what is "authentic" 
and what imported; the confusions of the culture Yamanaka describes are evidence
of the mixing of outside and inside language 
and cultures.  (Local culture, it could be argued, is authentic 
only insofar as it is hybrid; its resistances to dominant culture 
are shot through with evidence of it.  Dominant culture, then, is 
authentic only insofar as it is able to absorb local cultures.)
   <p>
  Both Yamanaka and Ashbery refuse to assert one authenticity 
against a myriad of imperial and imperious influences; Ashbery 
positively revels in them.  And, in so doing, he comes close to 
the nineteenth century artist, as Said describes him: "The imperial culture
mirrors itself in the artist's role as imperial 
creator" (116).  In the aria "And the Stars Were Shining," Ashbery's title poem,
the dying Cavaradossi sings (and writes) his 
farewell to Tosca: "And the stars were shining . . . the earth / 
smelt sweet . . . the garden gate creaked . . . / and a footstep 
brushed the sand."  To which Ashbery offers a counter-song, one 
that has a close brush with the aria's sad sentimentality; 
there's more than a touch of hopelessness, too, mitigated only by 
Ashbery's humor, his inconclusive final metaphor of life as the 
tying of shoelaces:
<p>
 Summer won't end in your lap,<br>
 nor are the stars more casual than usual.<br>
 Peace, quite, a dictionary--it was so important,<br>
 yet at the end nobody had any time for any of it.<br>
 It was as if all of it had never happened,<br>
 my shoelaces were untied, and--am I forgetting anything?<br>
Whitman's barbaric American yawp owed a great deal to European 
operas, but his "Song of Myself" was nonetheless written in a 
distinctly American language.  Ashbery, whose central subject is 
valedictory, subsumes himself in that inheritance some 140 years 
later, as if to suggest that the decadence of one tradition can 
be used as an analogy for the poet's inevitable loss of voice.  
Ashbery is not, like Eliot, seeking to put the eggshells of 
tradition back together again, but he is using them (as perhaps 
they are using him) toward an examination of America's continuing 
status as a colonial, creole, culture.  To put a more positive 
spin on it, Ashbery points toward the existence of a world culture that is made
up of the fragments of national cultures.  
Hence his comic apostrophe to the German historian in "The Decline of the West,"
some of which I've quoted earlier:
<p>
 O Oswald, O Spengler, this is very sad to find!<br>
<br>
 What! Our culture in its dotage!<br>
 Yet this very poem refutes it,<br>
 springing up out of the collective unconscious<br>
 like a weasel through a grating.  (46)<br>
 Whose is "our culture" in this case?  Is the poet defending 
western culture, or is he satirizing it?  Perhaps he is simply 
acknowledging his own status (this is best framed as a metaphor, 
not as fact) as a "creole" writer: "What is it, spring? I can't / 
/ help being a little European," he writes, after one of his many 
allusions to opera (34).  In this context it seems less odd to 
use Dr. Johnson as an authority in a poem entitled, "Spotlight on 
America": "Nothing like a big stranger in the dark / 'to concentrate the mind,'
as Dr. Johnson said" (51).  The poem's next 
reference is to those very American appurtenances, Venetian 
blinds.  In another of his opera poems, "On First Listening to 
Schreker's Der Schatzgraeber," he positions himself between 
Europe and the furthest reaches of the American empire, in words 
that made this resident of Honolulu feel self-conscious:
<p>
 The woman with the confused soul keeps calling.<br>
 Was gibt es? Now that you're in Honolulu you've got<br>
  to live it up<br>
 no matter what kind of grub they throw at you<br>
 on Main Street. O but my past is operatic<br>
 you see, the glitter, wind and shimmer,<br>
 all are in my bones. (58)<br>
On first reading the liner notes to Der Schatzgraeber, one finds 
Shreker's words on finishing it: "End of the opera.  12 November 
1918 (on the day of the declaration of the German-Austrian Republic and the
union with the German Reich!)."  It is, then, an 
opera historically associated with the dissolution of the Habsburg empire--a
postcolonial piece, if only by a matter of 
minutes.  
<p>
 With his usual wit, Ashbery piles on examples of sentences 
that alternate between European (and occasionally Japanese) 
references and American ones.  At times he translates between 
languages, or versions of them, as when he moves from American 
"hood" to English "bonnet" (26) (Yamanaka's spelling of "theatre" 
with a final English "re" seems relevant here) or quotes a French 
idiomatic expression, "dirty as a comb" (8) or uses words like 
"risible" that are more French than English (94).  In "Dinosaur 
Country" he mixes his English essayists with K rations:
<p>
 ["]Now I'm on an island in a self-engrossed river<br>
 with the selected essays of Addison and Steele<br>
 and enough K rations to last till Michaelmas<br>
 and its daisies, which, incidentally,<br>
 bloom only for me."  (60)<br>
And from the title poem:<br>
"The kitchen's not such a bad place,<br>
 if it's sinks you're after. Sure, Caruso was singing<br>
 somewhere behind the padlocked velvet door,<br>
 but if we stay--no, linger--here, the problem<br>
 will reverse itself. Tom and Jerrys all around." (94)<br><br>
I would suggest that Ashbery's use of references is not dissimilar to Yamanaka's
inclusion of Donny Osmond and Captain and 
Tenille in her poems about plantation life.  Like Yamanaka, 
Ashbery acknowledges the influence of other (colonial) cultures 
on his work and his language.  The death of the western empires 
that have given him language is analogous to his own loss of 
language and self.  In "Works on Paper I" he writes:<br>
 What will he do with it?<br>
 You're looking at an empire that has lost its clangor.<br>
 You get there by dying.  (30)
<p>
 I do not mean to draw too strict or close an analogy between 
Yamanaka's and Ashbery's work, for there are certainly differences between the
relative situations of the speakers of their poems 
(if Yamanaka's is a poor, abused, pidgin-speaking adolescent 
girl, then Ashbery's is an immensely learned, witty, middle-class, gay white man
who rather enjoys much of his predicament).  
The difference then, is one of class, as well as gender.  But it 
is also crucial to note that their languages are deployed for 
different reasons; Yamanaka, especially through her use of 
pidgin, resists inclusion in the (admittedly fluid) canon of 
American Literature.  Of course, that very resistance may lead to 
her inclusion in future anthologies.  Ashbery's resistances are 
more ironic; while he uses his own position as a colonial figure 
in And the Stars Were Shining, he hardly suggests a plan of 
resistance to it.  Instead, he operates more like an unambivalent 
Derek Walcott (if such can be imagined), by embracing all the 
voices that course through him.  Of course he has less need to 
resist dominant voices than does Yamanaka; after all, he IS a 
dominant voice.  He would agree with Walcott who, in "The Muse of 
History," writes contra Glissant's attack on assimilation: "But 
the tribe in bondage learned to fortify itself by cunning assimilation of the
religion of the Old World.  What seemed to be 
surrender was redemption.  What seemed the loss of tradition was 
its renewal.  What seemed the death of faith was its rebirth" 
(42).
