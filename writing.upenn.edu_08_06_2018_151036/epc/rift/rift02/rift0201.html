     <br>
<i>Translation from Stephane Mallarme<br>
</i><pre>
    
     Very vain but universal divinity, it
     won't display its own exterior.
          This refusal to betray any glim-
     mering ought to stop, as light becomes
     more and more outside.  Desperate ex-
     travagances, matching the penetrating
     vessel, no surrender, celebrating water
     and sky in its blaze.
          But, no!  The instant came
     flashing ...
          That a bank could crash, with
     the wave, the mediocre, the gray.
          Cash -- engine of terrible pre-
     cision, plain to consciousness -- in a
     certain sense, loses.
          Fantastical sunsets, as lone 
     clouds totter in the forsaking we make
     of dreams, treasure's liquidation, slinks,
     smoldering on the horizon.  I've had an
     inkling there of what's possible with
     ciphers of hundreds and more -- equally
     those whose account in an indictment or
     a financial lawsuit leaves me existentially
     cold.  The incapacity of grandiloquent
     figures to translate calls attention to an 
     instance sought out through this index:
     if a number grows and shrinks, approach-
     ing the improbable, it signs more or less
     zeros after its name, signifying its sum
     spiritually equivalent to next to nothing.
          A billion is smoke, except for the
     moment for going in for the kill.  Or, the
     lack of dazzlement, even with interest, 
     cites that a god isn't elected to be confined
     to the shadows of coffers and pockets.
          Without any complaints about my
     sillinesses' being duped by the obliteration
     of gold in the theatrical circumstances of
     seeming blinding, clear, cynical:  I dream on
     that, doubtless by default of money to shine
     abstractly, it is given to the writer to shore
     up the radiant glimpse with words he or she
     proffers forth as those of Beauty, and of Truth.

     I should have known the past<br>
     wouldn't give up so easily, jangling<br>
     like a dog's collar, the creak<br>
     of a truck at a local intersection,<br>
     distant tide of tires and beyond<br>
     that--of course!--the sea's snarl<br>
     and bend, its backwash almost<br>
     language (though at best, bad Wordsworth).<br>
     Take dictation, but don't subsume<br>
     self in another's syntax; break it<br>
     first (you who are so oppositional)<br>
     and though others surround you<br>
     with love, don't let it interrupt<br>
     your nervous ordinary search for<br>
     meaning--oh hackneyed two-syllable<br>
     counter-weight to wind or engine's<br>
     backfire, eternal summer's descent<br>
     into the sound, if not the self<br>
     of autumn, raking through palms<br>
     that once were scattered on ungraded<br>
     streets of a middle eastern city,<br>
     then reproduced in my golden book,<br>
     at which I wondered, always a skeptic<br>
     admiring belief. Child of dualities,<br>
     blessed with a genetic calm to lean<br>
     against an equally inherited panic,<br>
     I've invented more points of view<br>
     than Henry James to enforce my security<br>
     zone, and burnt toast reminds me<br>
     of an hour to which I'm not accustomed,<br>
     light scattering purple eastern<br>
     clouds before blue monotone. Birds, cars:<br>
     we are all commuters, fooled by a word<br>
     to think our sentences overturned--<br>
     clemency an act of justice, as of weather.<br>
     <br>
     Teased by prospects, the painter must<br>
     attend to colors, shifting attention<br>
     like a boxer to the particular glint<br>
     of sweat in his opponent's worry lines.<br>
     The smallest detail obsesses, cures<br>
     a larger wound, though TV gives us<br>
     too many: surely the pain of a dying<br>
     man is not eased by any number of NFL<br>
     injuries, though they are real and supplant<br>
     ours--if we're lucky--even for those<br>
     whose souls  outpace them, with jokes Freud<br>
     would want to note: denotation's the rage,<br>
     say students accustomed to meaning's brief<br>
     flirtation, the depths of its hiddenness,<br>
     taunting them like a green dwarf at the end<br>
     of a football field, whose function is as<br>
     mysterious as this process of learning things<br>
     so as to make our lives more difficult.<br>
     <br>
     My imagined jay chases fantasmal squirrels<br>
     in this mental protectorate of old time,<br>
     where friends proleptically retire<br>
     to houses in dull fields, peopled by cows<br>
     and muttering creeks, and the cost<br>
     of living is as friendly as the hypothetical<br>
     natives. Indigenous we ain't, though we are<br>
     envious of those our forbears foreclosed:<br>
     hence the guilt that seeps through halls<br>
     whose thick concrete has no capacity<br>
     to shield us from what mirrors we suspect.<br>
     Paranoia's the sanest form of inattention:<br>
     adds certainty to suspicions, is more constant<br>
     than the muse, whose spots of time wash out<br>
     with the red clay of pine fields and blood<br>
     that seeped around sugar stalks before<br>
     my advent, latest claimant of the land<br>
     and minds, perplexed guide to a literature<br>
     of snow and birches, unseen birds and<br>
     inconceivable snakes. This can't be Eden:<br>
     there never was a serpent that wasn't<br>
     impounded at the airport (where the temp<br>
     is always 85), and guavas resemble apples<br>
     only in their being fruits. Cast outside<br>
     the central myths, castaways of accustomed<br>
     sense, our vocabularies ambiguous as<br>
     rope bridges slung across crevasses<br>
     where stunt men ride bicycles off cliffs,<br>
     dangling like obsolescent dandelions<br>
     from parachutes. How green my valley<br>
     of Makiki, paved with asphalt and good<br>
     intents and purposes! Swim with dolphins,<br>
     they're so much freer than we are, even<br>
     in their hotel pools, from which they can<br>
     see presidents and rock stars, doubtless<br>
     awed by the experience. You tourists know<br>
     so much more than we about yourselves<br>
     and your momentary exile in what approximates<br>
     paradise (with exceptions duly listed above)--<br>
     deference is haste, but wastrels wear<br>
     their frowns, nameless as vagabonds, houseless<br>
     and somehow still free. I thank my friends<br>
     for this party, the indices of which I wasted,<br>
     though by my nature I am not unsuspicious.<br>
     Another codicil has been reached, and the plateau<br>
     comes into sharper focus, its playing field leveled:<br>
     Still, the future exists as concept.<br>
     I may yet settle there.<br>

The core text for the Negation cycle of ten poems is Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind.  For each poem, read the first letter of the line vertically downward,
and the Hegel passage emerges.  For example for "Negation 6" read "this
dwelling beside it is the magic power that converts the negative into being."  Various negations are at work in the poems.

        hippies., do you?<br>
        The pony is yelling for attention,<br>
        so three rather jolly good<br>
        sporting type hippies,<br>
        leap over for a chat.<br>
        "I say how's the fox running at York this year?",<br>
        says the pony.<br>
        pony, "make a damn good 3 dayer".<br>
        more funk and pony,"something about<br>
        vixen that really gets my Aries up"<br>
        Alles guten mein schon Fraulien RosenKreutz...<br>
<br><br>

        continues the pony,<br>
        " that's what happens when nobody<br>
        pays you attention" the pony<br>
        thinks loudly.<br>
        The ra ra yippie i say,<br>
        hippies have levitated to<br>
        the inner circle long<br>
        ago...<br>
        Feast on this...<br>
        There's a rather pudgie budgie looking like<br>
        a stone totem giving me the eye.<br>
        And depending which angle you<br>
        look there are several.<br>
        eyes..4 well quantized astronomers<br>
        engage in a jangle , house rising in<br>
        uranus., and descending in montana.<br>
        A joke around here would go down<br>
        like a phallic shaped<br>
        McDonalds hamburger.<br>
        Which could be bad or should be good.<br>
        Look I told you schmuk,<br>
        "Internationalist means well travelled".<br>
<br><br>

        I am an event to conceal my desire,<br>
        and what I'm shuvelling is<br>
        worse than the smell oozing from<br>
        "you mean its a bucket and<br>
        you chuck (it) close"<br>

        I wonder how Carol's rehearsal as Neptune<br>
        for tonight's pageant is working out?<br>
        I thought the wand and the hippy skirt<br>
        repurchased after letting it go for 15 years or so,<br>
        at Portobello Markets was a nice touch.<br>
        Carol said, she had one just like<br>
        it but I could see by the look in her eye<br>
        it was the very same<br>
        one she had given away in 1974.<br>
        It would be nice if it was haunted like<br>
        an unexpected and woven love letter.<br>
        I didn't want to be a six foot tall<br>
        invisible rabbit. I hate that role!!<br>
        "Now, don't sit on your hare and graces to me".<br>
        Came an aside from O-O.<br>
        Breeze coming in, and the quickening commences<br>
        ready to launch the kite,<br>
        "just run, it will take off"<br>
        like a lingering midi-day lunch.<br>

<p><hr><p><a name="editorial"></a><p><h3>EDITORIAL NOTE</h3><p>

<p>
      HOW DO YOU "READ" RIF/T?  We have given this question
considerable thought over the past two issues and would like to suggest
that this question is one for which there are many answers.  That is,
the electronic format delivers uncountable forms of maleability and
reproducibility -- along with blazing speed of transmission.  One fact
remains unarguable, however, and that is the format's present insistence
on deferral from "fixing" a presentation.  The number of means you may
employ to gain access to RIF/T -- http servers, our FTP site, or
whether you pick it up in your corner readerlist have countlessly
divergent effects on what may appear on your screen.  Your local
hardware and printer configurations also can vary its presentation
immeasurably.

<p>
      There are certain definable approaches, however.  First, you can
read RIF/T on your screen.  (Though in some systems you may not be
able to "scroll up.")  You can send RIF/T to your mainframe printer then
read it in line at the supermarket.  Or you can download it from your
mainframe to a file that will be "readable" on your PC.

<p>
      Our goal has been to design a species of versatility in RIF/T's
presentation that allows this text to "adapt" to these varied
circumstances.

<p>
      In addition, you will find new features in this issue to add oil to
the readability gears (though slippage is also encouraged):

<p>
      In the RIF/T file:  (1) Initial title words following each author's
name to allow you to use the "search" feature of your system to
immediately "find" pieces that grab your attention, and; (2) our Derrivations/Deviations section, appearing for the first time in this issue, presenting an interpretation of, or riff upon, our first issue. 

<p>
      The <a href="frie0201.html">FREI02.01</a> file, also presenting responses to, or riffs on the
file <a href="../rift01/riff0101.html">RIFF01.01</a> (presented in our first issue) is also highly noteworthy
as a very active "reading" of Issue 1.

<p>
      These "responses" are part and parcel of the "other" quality of
the electronic text: its receptiveness to reformating, reconfiguration,
retaliation.  We encourage you to consider the text as AT YOUR FINGERS
and look forward to receiving whatever impulses thereby may be fashioned.
