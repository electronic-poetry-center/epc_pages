<p>


     I came across Retallack's book under interesting circumstances.  I was
in Los Angeles to give a salon reading at Sun & Moon Press, and I had the
chance to visit John Cage's installation "Rolywholyover  A Circus" at the
Museum of Contemporary Art.  The first room of the exhibition consists of a
long table set up for browsing and for playing chess, surrounded by two
large cabinets of books and papers (some of which would be changed every
day). In fact, at first I smiled knowingly and thought that the two people
sitting down playing chess were part of the installation, but as we spoke
to one another I realized that they were no more installed than I was.  I
felt like I had arrived at John Cage's house only to find a note:  "I've
gone to the country.  Make yourself at home.  Feel free to browse."  The
book-browsing was a delight.  One of the first books I found was
Retallack's <i>Errata 5uite</i> (which, apparently, had just been published).  Then, during my stay in L.A., the poet/editor/critic A. L. Nielsen, with whom I was taping a radio show for KSJS, gave me a copy of Retallack's earlier book, <i>Circumstantial Evidence</i>. So, circumstantially, or by chance, my trip to L.A. became a way to realize that Retallack's poetry has now begun to gather in significance, strength, force, and importance.  (Such has already been known of her critical intelligence for some time now.) 

<p>
     At once philosophical and playful, intelligent and error-prone, Joan
Retallack's <i>Errata 5uite</i> is a remarkable production.  Bringing together the errata slip with the five lines of the musical staff, Retallack constructs a space for thinking.  Such a space bears kinship to the stanza--that is, it makes a room for thinking; it also asks us to rethink fundamental questions: poetry is a space for what?  From the cover art (also by Retallack) to the title (written on a five line staff) to the series of
five-line pages, Retallack's is a book which exhibits proudly an awareness
of its own constructedness.  As one of Cage's favorites, Thoreau, wrote in
Walden, "shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the
carpenter?." In terms of Kandinsky's division of modern art into two
polarities--expressionist and constructionist--Retallack's work positions
itself decisively in the latter camp.  Such a commitment marks a
considerable shift in her poetry from the earlier work represented in
<i>Circumstantial Evidence</i> (1985). 

<p>
     Let me present a sample (as best I can reproduce it) of a typical page
in Retallack's book (though in its layout in the book, both right and left
margins are justified, and there are a few accent marks which my lack of
computer-expertise may not allow me to reproduce): <br>
<pre>    
  read for for four last line misting eart aron (of) spoken rhythms untitled  
  add a pronoun what it is/has agitated to a strange and not (for) tensor   
  analytic reads as reads as follows crossing the ford where Emerson saw the  
  sky glad to the brink of fear ybore dislodg-ed enso semiamazia o tics of  
  zero sum ergo blather to rush to race to wander  
</pre>
<p>

If poetry, as a heuristic mode of thinking, allows chance, errors, and
stammers to figure into its arsenal of what even a compulsively eloquent
poet such as Wallace Stevens would call "sudden rightnesses," then the
reader of such poetry must learn to inhabit a reading-space which is less
rigidly thematized, less linearly insistent than the poetry of most earlier
moderns, including Stevens.  If there is a recurring "about" in Retallack's
book, it is "about" processes of reading--as in the errata slip,
recurrently a reading by replacement, "for x read y" (but also more
philosophically, "why read?"). 

<p>

     In miniature, the passage I have reproduced from Retallack's book
enacts many of the possibilities under investigation in _Errata 5uite_.  It
is the reader, in the rushes and stays of path-making, who enacts these
possibilities.  If we attend to our own processes in sense-making, and in
delight at the disturbance of habitual forms of sense-making, our own
phenomenology of reading becomes itself a heuristic device.  Oddly, there
is an authoritative tone to the errata slip--we are ordered into certain
directions of reading and substitution.  But the reproduction of the errors
themselves introduces a humor opposite (or is it apposite) to the command
voice of correction.  So that, as in the carefully multiple
manuscript-poems of Emily Dickinson, the poems and the passages do not
stabilize into their singularly corrected print but remain in their
multiply noted directions. Retallack's errata suites equivocate:  both the
"error" and the "correction" are given voice (or, more accurately, space
within which to be printed, and recognized).  Within such a field of
multiplicity, what Marjorie Perloff in an earlier phase of her scholarship
might have called a hymn to possibility, one such hymn, but now in a new
context, is that old tune of lyrical epiphany, a pleasing trace which
haunts much experimental writing, from that of John Cage to that of Susan
Howe.  In Retallack's passage, it is the Emersonian moment of the
transparent eyeball, glad to the brink of fear, a moment which (by its
familiarity) emerges from the welter of Retallack's dense textuality as a
kind of comforting narrative release.  Oddly enough, rather than Emerson's
own sudden retreat from the moment of insight and self-obliteration (back
into the conventions of the forward-moving essay), since Retallack's own
writing is not premised on self-expression but is (like Cage's) already
built on self- erasure, paradoxically, Retallack's fractured langauge
allows her/us to enter more substantially and decisively into the realm of
Emerson's ecstatic experience and to dwell there by means of a language not
tied to syntactical and semantic correctness.  We cross the ford into
"ybore disoldg-ed enso semiamazia o tics of/ zero sum ergo blather to rush
to race to wander."  In a sense, Retallack plays Emerson against himself. 
His own attention to the magical, philosophical properties of the
individual word--which Emerson finds to be a fossil holding the traces of
certain fundamental truths which we, as inspired readers (and
philologists), can decode--now is employed with the attention to the
individual word that we'd find in Stein (of Tender Buttons or the
Portraits).  If the word does have the resources that Emerson claims for
it, then much of twentieth century experimental writing has been a
literalizing and an exploring of those potentials.  To put it politically,
such poetry reclaims the rights of the signifier.  But those rights are not
claimed on behalf of the word as a vessel of truth but on behalf of the
word itself (freed of any preconceived obligation to a "higher" truth other
than the possibilities of its own particular being). 

<p>
     Many of the finest sections of Errata 5uite are built from the
writings of others.  Similar to Cage's process of writing through others,
Retallack's compositions are more a mode of radicalized anthologizing. 
That is, she exercises more choice in her selections and builds from them
more willfully. Here is one such example: <br><pre>
    
  art is a mode of prediction not found in charts & statistics (D1) poetry    
  and religious feeling will be the unforced flowers of life (D1) practical  
  socialism consists rather in a correct knowledge of the capitalist (E1) for
  the sceptics the ideal was to be optimistic (F1) the methodological    
  preeminence that thus belongs to poetry (G1)  
                
     D1-Dewey/E1-Engels/F1-Foucault/G1-Gadamer  
</pre>
<p>
 
But what is "the methodological preeminence that thus belongs to poetry"? 
Perhaps as David Antin argued in essays and interviews in the early 1970s,
the foundational activity for modernist writing is collage.  Perhaps, as in
some of Retallack's work, that methodological preeminence comes from and
illuminates the acts of reading and recomposing--reading as a means to
writing (and writing as a means to reading).  
 
<p>
    I know that for readers of RIF/T it is not necessary to ask that
typically conservative, xenophobic question:  "but is it really poetry?".
Nevertheless, in relation to Retallack's work in <i>Errata 5uite</i>, I find it
profitable to engage some of those square questions again.  For example,
what do we gain by calling it "poetry"?  I think that the term improves our
chances of hearing certain kinds of musical relationships among the sounds
of the words (as in Retallack's "courage to err and Guess that Mess for
read thru authors deranged/ chronologies foretasta alphabeta foreven were
earth's inner discontent/ assuaged").  And the term "poetry" seems like a
fit occasion for a perhaps vanishing mode of attentive reading, a sort of
hyper-alertness.  In his provocative and seminal book, <i>Word Perfect:
Literacy in the Computer Age</i> (Pittsburgh University Press, 1992), Myron
Tuman (by way of George Steiner) describes the changing scene of reading:  

<p>

   'To much of the planet,' writes George Steiner in the essay, 'The End of
Bookishness', (1988) 'what I have called the classical act of reading, the
private ownership of space, of silence, and of books themselves, never
represented a natural or native formula.'  For Steiner, changes in our use
of space and silence, brought on by changes in electronic technology, all
spell the end of a certain book culture, except perhaps as an object of
nostalgic yearning.  Gone, for example, is the 'circle of silence which
enables the reader to concentrate on the text'.  And for this Steiner is
not entirely sad, for he sees that we have already lost most of the
appreciation for the wondrous things contained in books.  Book culture, he
speculates, may exist in the future as it once existed in a more distant 
past, as the expression of a coterie, in what he calls 'houses of reading--
a Hebrew phrase--in which those passionate to learn how to read well would
find the necessary guidance, silence, and complicity of disciplined
companionship.' (10-11) 

<p>
     But the entire argument about the end of book culture, and its
replacement by a culture of digitalization and the VDT, often is staged
within a very limited conception of the reading processes possible within a
book culture.  Many of the most productive transgressive reading/writing
deeds within the book culture have occurred within the poetry texts of the
past one hundred (post-Mallarme) years.  And Retallack's own Errata 5uite,
in its celebration of "error" as a means to renewed, defamiliarized
expression and in its playfully intelligent collagist fusing of multiple
texts, creates a hyperspace within the domain of book culture.  What is so
remarkable about Retallack's book is that the presumably nostalgic gesture
of constructing a mode of writing out of contact with the bookish,
scholarly errata slip leads into a fractured, playful space of intelligent,
speculative thinking.  (I am also struck by the irony of my proof-reading
my own essay; Retallack's work makes me feel funny as I try to get her
cited errors "right.")

<p>
      Retallack's world of playful substitutions, of crazed phrasing and
conflicting semantic intersection, stands in opposition to an expressionist
(and distinctly Emersonian) dream of reading as a transcendental moment of
pure correspondence.  The latter--a romantic myth of reading--is best
represented in Wallace Stevens' poem "The House Was Quiet and the World Was
Calm": <pre>
           
     The house was quiet and the world was calm.           
     The reader became the book; and summer night   
           
     Was like the conscious being of the book.           
     The house was quiet and the world was calm.  
           
     The words were spoken as if there was no book,           
     Except that the reader leaned above the page,  
           
     Wanted to lean, wanted much most to be           
     The scholar to whom his book is true, to whom  
           
     The summer night is like a perfection of thought.           
     The house was quiet because it had to be.  
           
     The quiet was part of the meaning, part of the mind:           
     The access of perfection to the page.  
           
     And the world was calm. The truth in a calm world,           
     In which there is no other meaning, itself  
           
     Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself           
     Is the reader leaning late and reading there.  
</pre>
<p>

Stevens' dream is of a world (via reading) of pure correspondence, of such
correspondence (presumable of the reader's consciousness with the external
world) as constituting an ultimate truthfulness.  Retallack's
"truthfulness" or fidelity is to a world of much greater contingency--a
world of expressive error.  Or, in Charles Bernstein's terminology, a world
of dysraphism--the stitching together of mismatched parts (to produce a new
form of rhapsody). Thus, Retallack composes in what Stein calls the time
when the work still is taken to be ungainly and "ugly," a time in which
many contemporaries fail to realize that a (truly contemporary) work is
still beautiful even when and while it is jarring and odd.  In fact, more
generally, I would argue that our relationship to eccentric texts enacts a
more generalizeable political/social relationship to "otherness." 

<p>
      But to return more directly to the specific excellence of Retallack's
work:  her poetry is one of intersecting musics, where the rhetoric and
phrasing of good old Robert Frost meets a critique of mainstream
contemporary poetry's twin dullnesses--predictable scenic writing and
predictably sincere expression: <br>
<pre>    
  read ignomine domine flushed with sincerity's ergo sooner or later along    
  the horizon o creaking smiles to go to sleep to rest is history read for an 
  age not so much wrong as abstracht and preliminary the coastal scenic    
  drive to scenic points with almost all left out to know to read the blind   
  reed urgent moist and smooth fore rough & civil  
</pre>
<p>

As I read it, the scenic and the sincere profit immensely from erasure,
interruption, and discontinuity--else we read only a boring correctness, "o
creaking smiles to go to sleep."  And as I re-read Retallack's book, I
found a passage from Pascal's Pensees--a passage which I was forced to
memorize over twenty years ago--bubbling up into impertinent pertinence. 
Pascal claims, "L'homme n'est qu'un roseau, le plus faible de la nature;
mais c'est un roseau pensant."  Retallack's passage, and her recurrent
juxtaposition of "read" and "reed," makes me think again of Pascal's
version of man as "a thinking reed."  Retallack's work too offers a
thoughtful read, verdant reed/read, as eyes close to the page we learn "to
know to read the blind reed urgent moist and smooth fore rough & civil." 

<p>
      Retallack's <i>Errata 5uite</i> provides us with a reading experience of
choices.  I begin to hear in my head these kinds of transformations:  "the
road not taken" becoming "he rode not talkin" becoming "the road knot
talking."  But my form of word-play differs from Retallack's.  <i>Errata 5uite</i> celebrates the play of printed exchanges (whereas my passage, and much of my own writing, indulges in puns and other oral/aural forms of
replacement). In Retallack's invigorating stew of playful and sustaining
print, we find 
<br>
<pre>
   
 to read read real denied being there at all that is to cause to follow these
 the choices that make us defacto human bacchae melanesia cafeteria ergot   
 cert to be included a error for mirror interroregnum regulaterrrata p. 8   
 forementioned bag-O-bugs the gardeners friends late evenings   
 inadverdant soar remarks to others to mak ammendes  
</pre>

<p>

We see the Pleiades better by looking slightly away from them; in
Retallack's book we read (not exactly in Emily Dickinson's truth told
slant) but askew; as in the erotic play of Stein's tender buttons, we touch
around and slightly off.  And with each particular reading--"inadverdant
soar remarks."  We, greenly, make amends, pass amendments, read through
various emendations--"to follow these/ the choices." 

<p>
     As the last fragment of Retallack's composition (from Wittgenstein's
<i>Remarks on Color</i>) asserts and/or asks:  "phenomena of seeing.--For whom
does it describe them? What ignorance can this description eliminate (W2)".
Hers is an infectious world of textual play.  It does not eliminate
ignorance; instead, she compounds error, and thus earns interest on the
original casual investment.  Divested of the anxiety of correctness, her
suite-music (read sweet music) tolls for the (read thee).  It is, then, a
phenomenon of seeing which, I imagine, we would do well to listen too.

"I an I alone/a trod tru creation"<br>
       -Mikey Smith<br>

<p>

   In Dogon mythology, the egg within which primordial events 
transpired was divided into two twin placenta, each containing a pair 
of twin Nommo, who were the offspring of Amma (the first personalized 
being). Each twin, spiritually, was composed of both male and female 
principles, though in bodily form was either male or female. In this 
tradition, earth got off to a bad start:  in one placenta the male Nommo, 
Yurugu, became impatient for birth and forced his way out of the egg 
prematurely. He tore off a piece of his placenta and with it came hurtling 
down through space out of the primordial egg. The fragment of placenta 
became earth, though Amma's plans for creation had been seriously 
disorganized. The earth was now provided with only a predominantly male 
soul, which Amma recognized as incomplete and imperfect.  Eventually the 
son recognized this impurity and realized he could not rule the planet 
without his twin soul. He climbed back to heaven to find her but it was 
already too late, Amma had handed over Yurugu's twin soul to the other half 
of the placenta and she could not be found. From that time he has vainly 
searched for her. Yurugu, returning to earth, began to procreate in his own 
placenta, that is with his own mother. From this wretched act there came 
into existence single, incomplete beings sometimes known as the 
andoumboulou. 

<p>
   The twinning and tearing motifs we see in the Dogon cosmology 
provide one of the recurring themes throughout the writings of 
Nathaniel Mackey. In addition to some twenty-five "Song[s] of the 
Andoumboulou," eight of which appear in _School of Udhra_, there are 
other indicative passages in the "Outlantish" section _School of Udhra_:
<pre>
         Saw satisfaction in a bed of yeses
      calling it eelpot. Steeped indignation.
        Threat. Rhythmic imprint.
         Wishful,
          whispered, "Be my twin."
      Calling it
      raw, too crude a truth to admit.
      Desperate.
       Unrequited. Thicketed rush which
          if we could we'd outrun...
         Called it 
         caustic, luminous brew we sip
      wincing, seed finally free of its
         husk
      albeit broken, world an erotic
        inch
         out of reach
</pre>
The passage envisions a bonding ceremony, and a broken seed's 
release--ritual activity, an unlost pact.

<p>
   <i>Djbot Baghostus's Run</i>, the second installment of Mackey's ongoing 
prose work "From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate," 
begins with a letter by the protagonist N. describing a rehearsal of 
the Mystic Horn Society (N.'s band) in which the women in the band 
protest against the consideration of a male rather than a female in 
the group's search for a new drummer. Dressed identically, the 
women arrive at the rehearsal together and, before launching into a 
powerful duet, hand out cards to the men present proclaiming, 'Halve 
Not, Will Travel.' N., speculating on the  scene unfolding around him, 
muses "...the card had said 'Halve Not.' Not 'have-' but 'halve':  
meaning, one took it, to divide into two equal parts, to share equally." 
N. continues, "To what extent, one wondered, did the preemptive 
concert and catechism rolled into one amount to an arraignment, a 
charge of inequality, a threat of succession." In this passage twinning 
and tearing motifs work both separately and together. Eventually the 
group finds a woman drummer named Drenette who,  according to N., 
when responding to a romantic composition Penguin (a male group 
member) pens for her, "changed the rhythm he suggested to 
something more difficult, more complex, polyrhythmic. 'It's about 
splitting yourself in two,' she said."

<p>
   Parallel to the twinning and tearing metaphors run a series of 
images of location and dislocation throughout Mackey's work. "From 
a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate" locates itself in 
African, Caribbean, Jazz and other cultures whose roots are largely 
ignored in the United States. The ongoing reports on the doings on N., 
the Mystic Horn Society, and Jarred Bottle (the band's phantom 
member) illuminate the music, ritual, and other communal aspects of 
these people in the music and other conversations between band 
members. Alternatively, there are definite moments where we read 
the enormity of the pervasive dislocation of that culture within the 
dominant culture. 

<p>
   In a chapter entitled "Limbo, Dislocation, Phantom Limb:  Wilson 
Harris and the Caribbean Occasion," from his _Discrepant Engagement:  
Dissonance, Cross-Culturality, and Experimental Writing_, Mackey 
describes the situation faced by many of those living in "third" world 
countries today:
<blockquote>
      'So on this ground,/write.../on this ground/on this broken ground,' 
      writes Edward Kamau Brathwaite. These lines have to do with the
      Caribbean condition--fragmentation, dislocation, and so forth. The 
      'broken ground' is the island topography itself, the separation of the 
      islands from one another as though they were remnants of some 
      larger, sundered whole. It is also the ground of other breakages and 
      a metaphor for such breakages--the broken, alienated labor of slave 
      and descendants of slaves, the ecological breakdown or depletion of 
      the soil due to decades of mono-crop agriculture, the break, albeit 
      partial, with old world homelands, old world histories, old world 
      continuities and 'coherencies,' the further breakage brought about by 
      the collision of cultures under circumstances of enmity and coercion. 
      These lines also have to do with writing, and if one calls to mind the 
      Derridean idea that the very possibility of writing signifies and is 
      indebted to a cosmogonic severance known as differance, one is 
      prepared to understand 'this broken ground' in the way that Harris 
      does. The Caribbean's brokenness participates in a larger-than-local 
      problematic, the universal human predicament Harris calls 'cosmic 
      frailty', an ontological estrangement or weakness the Caribbean 
      writer, having no historically sustained 'coherency' as insulation or 
      defense, is in a position to confess. The problem of large-scale 
      emigration from the Caribbean, for example, the fact that every year 
      an enormous number of West Indians leave home in search of 
      economic, educational, cultural, and other opportunities abroad, is 
      not simply a manifestation of the dependency situation peculiar to 
      the Caribbean but is endowed by Harris, himself an emigrant now 
      living in England, with suggestions of a universal condition of exile. 
      In Idiot Nameless's 'Manifesto of the Unborn State of Exile' in the 
      _Eye of the Scarecrow_ then:
<p>
      The education of freedom...begins with a confession of the 
      need to lose the base concretion men seek to impose when they
      talk of one's 'native' land (or another's) as if it were fixed
      and anchored in place. In this age and time, one's native land
      (and the other's) is always crumbling: crumbling within a
      capacity of vision which re-discovers the process to be not
      foul and destructive but actually the constructive secret of
      all creation wherever one happens to be. 
</blockquote>
<p>

What Harris, Brathwaite and Mackey seek to employ here is an 
across-the-globe unification on several levels. We are asked to 
consider the cosmos, all the various peoples and cultures of the 
world, and many other foreign territories in the way weconceptualize 
our species and the way relate to the planet in order to ensure an 
on-going life cycle.

<p>
   Kamau Brathwaite, near the end of "Trench Town Rock" (<i>Hambone 
10</i>), in a section called "Short History of Dis," writes "By now the Age 
of Dis. Distress Dispair & Disrespect. Distrust Disrupt Distruction." His 
statement reflects the results of a systematic oppression and violence 
inflicted on anyone victimized by racism, colonization, xenophobia, 
Christianity, and other forces which have contributed to the 
dispossession of people. The forcible removal of so many Africans to 
the Caribbean and the Americas was but the first disruption which 
affected following generations. Plantation and other slaveries, other 
racially biased atrocities have contributed to further cultural 
fragmentation and disintegration of African descendants. Certainly 
the type of work Mackey does is an intellectually based practice 
aimed at alleviating some of this disrespect by engaging the 
intensities which make up his cultural/historical and/or mythological 
background. Mackey's work points out the absences and blindspots 
both in the literatures to which most Americans are exposed in the 
educational system and in the culture at large. At the very least his 
poetic project raises questions about a poetics which has been 
rendered useless by entities which have upheld an under-emphasis 
on "third" world cultures and peoples. These are the organs of 
literature which Don Byrd describes in his essay "Learned Ignorances 
and Other Defenses" in <i>Sulfur 11</i>, whose function "is to choke 
intelligence with a kind of irreducible fluff, which absorbs attention 
in the fascination of stimulus-response psychology." N., in a passage 
in <i>Djbot Baghostus's Run</i>, criticizes "the patness of the 'shattered 
I,'" and derides the "currently fashionable notions of a nonexistent 
self" which has asphyxiated so many people involved with the 
studies in language and literature over the past three decades in 
Europe and North America.

There are few writing poetry in English who surpass Nathaniel 
Mackey's level of sophistication with language, topical inclusiveness 
and lyrical musicality. At a recent reading in Woodstock, New York, 
Mackey was introduced as "the Cecil Taylor of poetry," but the 
opposite might also be said to be true, that Cecil Taylor could be 
called the Nathaniel Mackey of music. With some exceptions, there 
are few writers who have taken it upon themselves to attack, 
untune, and re/turn their songs while retaining an impeccable 
cohesion in their work the way both Mackey and Taylor succeed 
in using the chords of their craft. In "Alphabet of Ahtt," a poem from 
"Outlantish," dedicated to Taylor, a tension released is manifest
<pre>
      Not without hope though
      how were we to take it as
       they yelled out, "Nathtess's melismatic 
             ttah?"
        Not knowing why, we looked straight
       ahead, shrugged our shoulders,
      popped out fingers, we could dig it,
             "What's next?"
</pre>
<p>

Later in the poem the song is tightened and recontextualized:

<p>
<pre>

      Made us wonder would it ever do
       differently, all but undone to've
        been so insisted on,
         anagrammatic
        ythm, anagrammatic myth...
       Autistic.
         Spat a bitter truth. Maybe misled but
        if so so be it. Palimpsestic
        stagger,
        anagrammatic
      scat

   In an essay in the 1992 issue of <i>Talisman</i> devoted to the writings 
of Nathaniel Mackey, Aldon Neilsen explicitly declares that Mackey 
"...has begun the work of reading American poetic culture back 
through its African past." Indeed, Mackey's work explores and 
celebrates this culture's traditions and mythologies which have, over 
the past four centuries or so, been forcibly removed from their 
original place of standing. By and large, the ancestry Mackey 
engages today normally finds itself re-located, at best, only on the 
fringes of the conscience of the dominant culture which enacted this 
displacement. However, Mackey's tenses, like those of Charles Olson 
before him, "are never past but present and future." Again, from 
<i>School of Udhra</i>,<br>

   Mackey's books are maps of a large region. In them, he transverses 
grounds of literal and figurative forests, fields, and sands he knows 
well. His work especially displays intricate knowledge of the desert--
its varieties, its mood, its resources. A literary bedouin, Mackey 
invokes and channels the desert dwellers who were, for their 
cleverness, the descendents of the spirits--the jinns--that inhabit the 
world. Mackey has also inherited a Bedouin's expertise over his 
camel--its needs and capacities, and the peculiarities and possibilities 
of each animal. Above, there is an example of Mackey's movement to 
stretch the boundaries of language ("Nathtess's melismatic/ttha?") 
while at the same time tying it to something earthly 
("anagrammatic/scat"). In another passage from _School of Udhra_, the 
word play continues, as do the earthly images of bonding (twinning) 
and alienation (tearing):<br>
<pre>

      touched "I-ness" to "I-ness,"

       otherness, nothingness,
         Nephthys,
          Nut...         Inductees
       into the academy of N'ahtt
</pre>

<p>

   Those familiar with Mackey's work already know its particular and 
special place in literature of North America today. Defiant of any 
simple categorization, his vision is a hybrid of living ethnopoetics and 
musical and spiritual influences which are deeply rooted in a 
beleaguered but surviving African continent. These cultures, which 
inspired Jerome Rothenberg in the PRE-FACE of <i>Technicians of the 
Sacred</i> to pronounce "Primitive Means Complex," are invoked and 
serve as inspiration to Mackey, whose most direct literary forbearers 
would be Brathwaite and Harris. In their revitalization the 
geopsychic space of Caribbean literature, Harris and Brathwaite have 
extensively engaged Africa's cultural diaspora. They are writers who 
recognize an ancestral landscape which involves, as Brathwaite 
writes in an essay called "Timehri," "...the artist and participants in a 
journey into the past and hinterland which is at the same 
time a movement of possession into the present and future." Above 
all, Mackey has absorbed the cries we hear in jazz and tribal music. 
Coltrane's and other's horns, Jamaica's Tuff Gong, and the wailings of 
aboriginal tribes all find themselves as revered ingredients in 
Mackey's work, growing out of the depths of rich and arid African 
soil.
<p>

   1993 was a busy year for Mackey's readers. In addition to the 
anthology <i>Moment's Notice:  Jazz In Poetry & Prose</i> (edited by 
Mackey with Down Beat editor Art Lange; Coffee House Press, 1993. 
373 pp. $17.50), new collections of his poetry (<i>School of Udhra</i>), 
prose (<i>Djbot Baghostus's Run</i>) and literary history/criticism 
(<i>Discrepant Engagement:  Dissonance, Cross-Culturality, and 
Experimental Writing</i>) were published. It is notable that all of the 
books, though technically from different "genres," collectively 
continue to form a dense sounding of Mackey's larger project which 
includes <i>Hambone</i>, the literary magazine he edits,  "Tanganyika 
Strut," his radio program, and teaching at the University of 
California-Santa Cruz. In addition to its romantic and lyric qualities, 
Mackey's work is an immediate encounter with an intense blending 
of knowledges, mythology, poetic insight and histories from every 
continent. 
<p>

   Borrowing a phrase which Mervyn Morris once used to describe 
the spirit of Jamaican dub poet Mikey Smith, Nathaniel Mackey is "a 
true revolutionary who has fought the struggle not with bullets or 
guns but with his own culture, with his own livity." Mackey's prolific 
labors, his conjugation of myth, mind, history, sound, nomadic text 
and awareness offer an integral projection and model of what a 
culturally imaginative and intellectually and devotionally informed 
poetics entails. Mackey's rebel stance is subtle but runs throughout 
the work, a voice which calls attention to discontent and unrest, 
mobilizing an erudite, up-to-date awareness of pervasive racial and 
cultural inequalities and injustices.

   An acknowledgement of the type of psychic training and slavery 
inflicted upon people today, an indication of their fear of a policed 
state, occurs at the beginning of a piece called "APRIL IN PARIS," 
subtitled "The Creaking of the Word:  After-the-Fact Lecture/Libretto 
(Aunt Nancy Version)" in <i>Djbot Baghostus's Run</i>. Jarred Bottle, sitting at a stoplight in Los Angeles at three in the morning, thinks of a quip he'd heard before, "Revolution would never occur in a country whose 
people stop for traffic lights late at night when there's no one else 
around." Subsequently, sitting at the intersection, defiantly 
"deferring to nonexistent traffic," Bottle constructs an exquisite ten-
plus page journey of romantic ("...so tenuous a thread could be so 
binding made for a mystery only moans could address") and musical 
intrigue (he swears he hears the horns of imaginary cars playing the 
three chord melody line from Frank Wright's "China"). In the midst of 
his trance he reconstructs part of the meeting with Aunt Nancy (a 
member of the Mystic Horn Society), from which he was coming. His 
work, he explained to her, "would revolve around locale and 
dislocation, two terms of a continuing obsession he felt not so much 
prompted as dictated by." Jarred Bottled comes out of his spell, 
finally, when a policeman approaches him. The section concludes:
<p>
<blockquote>
      The cops would ask him had he been drinking, ask what was the idea 
      of just sitting there. He'd tell them he was a Rastafarian, that he 
      was waiting for the red, yellow, and green lights to come on at the 
      same time. "All this time," he'd explain, "I've been thinking about 
      Paris and China, but it was Ethiopia I was actually headed for." 
      The cops would have no idea what he meant.
</blockquote>
<p>
Nods to the Rastafarians--those followers of Haile Salassie who 
believe Ethiopia is Eden, and that blacks will eventually be 
repatriated to Africa--are steady in both <i>Djbot Baghostus's Run</i>  and 
<i>School of Udhra</i>. In a later rendition of "The Creaking of the Word:  
After-the-Fact Lecture/Libretto (Lambert Version)," titled "AX ME 
NOW," Jarred Bottle dreams he is being interrogated in a cell in which 
newsreel footage of Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia are being 
projected. He is about to speak when he hears the tenor sax of the 
Mystic Horn Society's Lambert emerging from a chorus in back of 
him. The description of the sound Bottle hears echoes the words of 
Bob Marley's dancehall hit "Small Axe" ("If you are the tall tree/we 
are are the small axe, sharp and ready/ready to cut you down..."):
<blockquote>
<p>

      Any speaker worth his or her pocomaniacal salt, it seemed to go 
      without saying, "tore" the language or, as he had lately preferred to 
      put it, chopped it up. Jarred Bottle's lecture, that is, took him back 
      to his adopted boyhood in Jamaica. Thus the projections of Italy's 
      invasion of Ethiopia. One of his most vivid and strongest boyhood 
      recollections was the way news of it had fired people up in Kingston. 
      Likenings of it to the crucifixion of Christ by "the said same 
      Romans" rolled off almost every tongue. Lambert's low-to-the-ground 
      inspection of hostile terrain, his pentacostal run, like-wise insisted 
      on prophetic fulfillment, the eventual triumph of Ethiopia, small axe 
      to Mussolini's tall tree.
</blockquote>
<p>

In "Amma Seru's Hammer's Heated Fall" (<i>School of Udhra</i>) is a place
      
<pre>
      There,
          though if other than for reflection
         none would say,         wondering,
      coming forth, where they'd come
       from, edgewise informant, small 
        axe,
      tall tree...   
</pre>      

   At the end of <i>Djbot Baghostus's Run</i>, there is another edition of 
"The Creaking of the Word:  After-the-Fact Lecture/Libretto (Penguin 
Version)," which carries title "E PO PEN." Jarred Bottle, twinning 
again, becomes Djbot Baghostus. Baghostus is literally interpreted 
brother (Ba-) of a ghost (ghostus). A grasshopper beneath his pillow 
speaks to him "from under it rather than on it, as if put there (eye of 
Amma, Ogo's food) by a Dogon diviner":
<p>

<blockquote>

      "Tell them you're not from here. Tell them your father is a wealthy 
      man, that he sang with the Ink Spots before they made it big but 
      that nevertheless he's a very wealthy man. Tell the that's why he 
      named you Djbot. Spell it out for them if you have to:  d as in dot, 
      j as in jot, b-o-t as in bottle. Tell them it relates to ink, 
      eponymous ink, namesake ink. Tell them you're not from here, even 
      that you're not really here. Tell them it relates to ink, invisible 
      ink. You can never make too much of it. Tell them you're a ghost."
</blockquote>
<p>

Djbot's father, the "very wealthy man," reads metaphorically as the 
African pantheon, alive as long as any Greco-Roman tradition or 
myth. The "invisible ink" is an overt acknowledgement that this 
tradition is generally unseen by "them," or less discriminated against 
personages. The passage implies transformation, and suggests an 
empowerment derived from both the location and dislocation 
Bottle/Djbot has and will likely continue to experience.

<p>
   In order to read this work, prepare yourself to face a sometimes 
unfamiliar orientation and a matrix of references to which most 
readers with Eurocentric educations are unaccustomed; step into a 
self rooted in and derived from a people and culture suppressed by a 
systematically white supremacist literary politic throughout recent 
history. You will be impressed at the way Mackey is able to make the 
poetic intellectual and the intellectual poetic, or poetry. As Will 
Alexander recently said, "think of how many PhDs there are, then 
look how many Lorcas..." Nathaniel Mackey is one of few who 
qualifies as both. Somewhere Gertrude Stein said, "when poetry really
began it practically included everything." Mackey's writing, which 
recycles such a theory of poetics, might be read as a communique to 
an angel of dust, an imaginary I-nity who embodies all that we are 
proverbially made of. 


<p>
   In Mackey's utopian, mythical city of "Zar" (which, an epigraph tells 
us, is "just this side of far"), celebrated in and title of the third and 
final section of <i>School of Udhra</i>), we read of a
<br>
<pre>
      militant, ritual
      fist
        held high, pushed 
         on...

and
      
      ...the guns of war.
       Shot god, bitter
         book turned real. There they might
       look but that their gone gaze
        grow there,
       taken,       meaning made at whose
       expense, twinned or twinless...
        Twinless,
       torn
      within
</pre>
"Zar", and <i>School of Udhra</i>, come to an end with a poem called 
"Slipped Quadrant," which offers further advices and admonitions:
<br>
<pre>

      Rich
          tense within we called it,
         would without end,     seed
      within a seed sown elsewhere,
         somewhere
       said to've been known as 
      Ttha.
      Wrought        surfaces, putative
      soul,         cheated heart.      Shot
       body borne up to be looked
        at, learned from, one
      heretical
          moment's reprimand...
      Something a
      Sufi said in Andalusia.
      Something
          said to've been said before.
         Ominous music made a mumbler's 
                                                            academy,
        vatic scat,       to be alive
      was to be warned it said...
</pre>

<p>
      
Mackey's "seed/within a seed sown elsewhere" is a continual seed, a 
transplanted seed, a seed of discontent, in favor of creating a better 
society, sown into American poetics.<br>
