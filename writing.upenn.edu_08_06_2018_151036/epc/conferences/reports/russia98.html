Dear Maria <br><br>

At last I am up to writing. I'm so overwhelmed with the crisis here -
and not  only the crisis but the way things have been going here since
an attempt has  been made in the 90s to dismantle the Soviet
regime. Now it's clear that  they should have kept as much as possible
from the past structure because now  nobody is competent and noble
enough to build something decent. Now the festival...  <br><br>

Oct 17,18 and 19 in St Petersburg. Moika 12, Pushkin's apartment. The
hall in the former stables is packed full - about 200 people have come
which is a marvel: the crisis in Russia is in full swing. The first
two nights poets read - twelve poets every night.  The last night -
round table and reception. Among Moscow guests - prominent literary
figures Lev Rubinstein who read his famous piece "This is me" filing
through catalogue cards that he was holding in his hand (he worked as
a librarian for many years) - the whole poem is a list of photographs
of his family, friends and relatives with short comments, an attempt
to catch the time long past and very amusing too. The way he reads
holds the audience in suspense.  Dmitry Prigov, a master of "sotsart"
(socialist art) drawing heavily on soviet idiom. This time he gave a
brilliant performance singing the first verse of Pushkin's "Evgeni
Onegin" as a buddhist monk, Russian Orthodox priest and muslim
muezzin. Someone said later: "How could he dare mock Pushkin, the sun
of Russian poetry?" That's exactly what Prigov meant - to destroy the
ideological structure built in the Soviet times on Pushkin.
Bonifatsii (German Lukomnikov) - a charming person and performance
artist read some of his short and extremely witty (for us who live
here) poems.  One of them: "Why don't I fly?" (several times with
different modulations of voice but very romantically) And suddenly in
a matter-of-fact and slightly offended tone "Why don't I fly? I fly."
Dmitry Avaliani showed his inscriptions on large pieces of paper,
cardboard, on bowls and other unlikely stuff that could be read upside
down too making the two words reveal the inner meanings of each
other. He is a superb master of anagrams and palindromes.  Dmitry
Vodennikov, one of the younger participants, with his outwardly
unpretentious poems that manage somehow to convey the capricious mood
of his generation, their seeking for the final truths and
deconstruction of falsehoods.  Viktor Krivulin of St.Petersburg, a
basic figure in Russian underground literature of Brezhnev's time,
opened the first night of readings.  Among St.Petersburg poets -
wonderful Vladimir Kucheriavkin and Nikolai Kononov, very deep Sergei
Stratanovsky, Mikhail Eremin - all first-class poets of present-day.
What was amazing in St.Petersburg was the atmosphere and the response
of the public. It was so warm and energetic, so energetic that there
were fistfights.  Every twenty minutes there was a commotion in the
audience, the people were expressing their various emotions ranging
from disgust to appreciation by, for example, standing up and reading
their own poetry in a loud voice and there was no stopping
them. Dmitry Kuzmin, a leading figure in Moscow literary life, a poet
and critic, a curator of the poetic salon "Avtornik" (meeting every
Tuesday), even had to break the readings and appeal to the public
trying to shame them into a better behavior. But his appeals were
wasted. During Kononov's reading a man stood up (by the way he was a
friend of Sergei Zavialov, organizer of the festival) and said,
addressing the audience, that the poet in question was a bloody
bustard and his poetry is a piece of disgusting bullshit (Kononov was
reading a poem about man-eaters, cannibals and used some obscene
language}, this confrontation of two aesthetic positions came to a
climax in the interval when Kononov had a fight with his
admirer. Moscow guests had a great time watching all this because (as
we, St.Petersburgians found later , during the Moscow part of the
festival) the sophisticated Moscow, tired of life and not to be
surprised with stuff, haven't seen anything like this since the time
of (maybe) Mayakovsky who loved scandal. They were happy to discover
that there are still people in Russia who could kill for poetry. In
Moscow the festival public was very respectable - only literary people
came: poets, critics, curators of poetic salons; their girl-friends (a
few) were the only independent observers.  A propos girl-friends. What
was notoriously missing at the festival were women authors and
critics: nearly forty participants for three women (four including me
as wife and helper for the organizer and a translator of a visiting
poet from Germany Schuldt).  On the last day of the festival at the
discussion a visiting poet from Boston Jim Kates (who also gave a
reading alongside with the German poet Schuldt) tried to raise the
question of women-participants but no-one even cared to answer it
properly. The only thing we seemed to be good for was washing the
marble floors of the salon where the final reception was held (this
action was performed by the author of these lines - I meant it to be a
performance but nobody noticed).  Now I would like to strike a serious
key. The festival was intended to research into the phenomenon of
Moscow and St.Petersburg poetry, two rival cities of Russian
culture. Is it really that, as the Moscow poet Mikhail Aizenberg put
it, there is good poetry, bad poetry and St. Petersburg poetry?  The
results of the research prove that St. Petersburg poetry numbers some
first-class poets but, to my mind, they are those who border on Moscow
styles, who like experimenting and who are ready to give up beautiful
lines for freshness, throb of time and enjoyment their poetry could
give to the public.  Dostoevski called St. Petersburg "the most
abstract and artificial city on earth".  The same can be said about
some of the poetry here.  Some of the St. P. poets write the way as if
nothing happened for the last eighty years, as if they can start right
where the pre-revolutionary Silver-Age poets left off. Moscow people
realize that they have to work through the Soviet period and
incorporate it somehow into their writing. They act as psychoanalytics
for the national sub-conscious working through phobias and anxieties
accumulated during the desolate years of Stalinism and Brezhnevism.
Strange as it may seem for you but this festival demonstrated that
what poets write is not their personal affair. It's not true that
there are good poets and there are bad poets as was said at the
festival (and thousands of times before but here in the sense that
there is no Moscow and St.Petersburg poetry there is good etc.) There
is Moscow poetry (I think) that takes the time into account and
becomes timeless and St.P. poetry that is timeless and dies the moment
it is published (not all of it of course) Poets have to feel their way
into the complexities of the time they are living in.And sometimes
it's only much later that it becomes evident who was in contact with
the spirit of the time and who was not. It doesn't matter what they
write about, they always write about modernity.<br><br>

Oh, dear, that's enough for today. I'm afraid it's too long already.
If you have any questions please you are very welcome. Maybe I should
add  something  or focus on some other things of more interest for
you.  So this report is subject to change. You could make it
shorter. Or I could  write another shorter one using some of the
above.<br><br>
