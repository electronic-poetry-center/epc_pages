<font size=5 color=black>HAPPY BIRTHDAY HANNAH! </font><br>
<font size=4 color=black>Simply listing the 30 or so<br>
<br>
<br>
folks who read or spoke or<br>
showed films, slides or dream hoops<br>
<br>
<br>
at the 70th birthday memorial celebration<br>
of Hannah Weiner can't possibly convey<br>
<br>
<br>
what a remarkable and special event took<br>
place at St. Marks Church last Saturday.<br>
<br>
<br>
The celebration was organized by Andrew<br>
Levy, Lee Ann Brown and Charles Bernstein,<br>
<br>
<br>
three poets who really get what the word<br>
community suggests, and was framed by<br>
<br>
<br>
their own contributions, Andrew leading off<br>
with a reading of his piece from the<br>
<br>
<br>
Poetry Project Newsletter. There were<br>
70 people present at the beginning and<br>
<br>
<br>
maybe 80 at the very end three and<br>
one-half hours later, as lots of people<br>
<br>
<br>
came and went over the course of<br>
the event. At one point I counted<br>
<br>
<br>
over 100. Hearing Hannah's work<br>
read by most of the 30 speakers over<br>
<br>
<br>
such an extended period of time<br>
(and, I believe, with only one piece<br>
<br>
<br>
repeated during the entire afternoon)<br>
was itself a total immersion, and it<br>
<br>
<br>
was evident constantly just how<br>
deeply her work has seeped into so<br>
<br>
<br>
many of our reading/writing/thinking<br>
styles. Some of the moments that stuck<br>
<br>
<br>
out for me:<br>
Bruce Andrews' reading of "Bruce Introduces" --<br>
<br>
<br>
"Hannah can't embarrass me with this anymore<br>
so I'll have to do it myself" -- a fabulous<br>
<br>
<br>
articulation of tough guy voices in Hannah's work.<br>
Abigail Childs' reading from a correspondence<br>
<br>
<br>
with Hannah, working out the details of a collaboration<br>
I wish that I'd seen. Both Hannah's style and her total<br>
<br>
<br>
commitment to craft and detail completely evident.<br>
Tina Darragh getting exactly right how Hannah's voice<br>
<br>
<br>
would change on the phone in an instant and<br>
become totally business-like if you just asked the right question.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lewis Warsh's reading of Hannah's birthday poem<br>
from The Fast. And pleading for someone to bring<br>
<br>
<br>
Clairvoyant Journal back into print.<br>
Phill Niblock's and Henry Hills' films of Hannah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hannah seemingly decades younger in Niblock's 1974<br>
version reading from Clairvoyant Journal than in<br>
<br>
<br>
Henry's 1981 Plagiarism, which however included<br>
very young versions of Charles Bernstein (with an<br>
<br>
<br>
"Art Garfunkel" afro that made the audience gasp),<br>
James Sherry and Bruce Andrews.<br>
<br>
<br>
Carolee Schneeman's slideshow of old photos --<br>
her and Paul Blackburn waiting for Hannah at a<br>
<br>
<br>
Be-In, Hannah cooking dinner "sane as a button"<br>
in the 60s, etc -- and especially Schneeman's dream hoop<br>
<br>
<br>
that contained several bras designed by Hannah<br>
during her early 1960s careers as a lingerie designer,<br>
<br>
<br>
to which Carolee added pink Christmas tree lights.<br>
Carolee described meeting Hannah as the result<br>
<br>
<br>
of a planned performance piece in which, at a very<br>
late moment before the event, the sponsors indicated<br>
<br>
<br>
that the performers could not, in fact, appear nude,<br>
so that she went to Maidenform to ask about<br>
<br>
<br>
"experimental underwear" and the folks at Maidenform<br>
said "you must meet Hannah Weiner."<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael Heller's account of Kenneth Koch's 1964<br>
writing class that included Hannah, Ceravolo, Kathy Fraser,<br>
<br>
<br>
Heller himself, Towle and about 10 other immediately<br>
recognizable names, as well as a later period in Europe<br>
<br>
<br>
(Greece?) where Hannah came and worked on what<br>
became the Code Poems. An account of the coast guard's<br>
<br>
<br>
willing participation in one of the events and of<br>
Hannah's "street events." Sharon Matlin's lengthy<br>
<br>
<br>
fictional memoir of "Elizabeth." Matlin and<br>
Barbara Rosenthal spoke pointedly about the role<br>
<br>
<br>
and the problems faced by the isolated woman artist.<br>
Maurice Finegold, Hannah's brother, describing<br>
<br>
<br>
Hannah at a much earlier age, as a student at the<br>
Rhode Island School of Design, then writing<br>
<br>
<br>
her honors thesis on Graham Greene at Radcliffe,<br>
how his family reacted to Hannah's psychotic episodes.<br>
<br>
<br>
How the rabbi at her service was unable to figure<br>
out what to do with her books, how to incorporate<br>
<br>
<br>
that, but how they then found the memorial material up<br>
on the EPC website and used a lot from that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maria Damon's reading of her "belated" reply<br>
to a letter Hannah sent several months before<br>
<br>
<br>
her death, an account of all the current critical<br>
material now being produced about Hannah.<br>
<br>
<br>
James Sherry speaking of Hannah's attention to<br>
detail, spending 40 hours going over EVERY<br>
<br>
<br>
line of Little Books/Indians to make sure it was<br>
exactly correct. Lee Ann Brown and Charles<br>
<br>
<br>
Bernstein performing Hannah's work in two<br>
voices to complete the occasion.<br>
<br>
<br>
These notes scribed from material<br>
written in a Square Deal Marble Memo<br>
<br>
<br>
notebook (80 sheets, 4.5x3.25 inches),<br>
much like the ones in which<br>
<br>
<br>
Hannah composed Little Books/Indians.<br>
