The Boston Alternative Poetry conference still in progress  at
Blacksmith House, as I tap on these keys, is at fevery pitch, to coin
a phrase.  Friday kicked off with readings from Daniel Bouchard, Drew
Gardner, Wil Alexander, Fanny Howe.  Bouchard bounces off generic
events, news wrap-ups, say, and apt linkages such as those between
game show evangelism and Mr. Clinton's recent visit to the MIT
computer labs.  Drew Gardner resuscitates (one of my favorite words
right now!) something verging on urban elegiac, thinking it through to
its after-Ashbery and unawful, sense-making matrices within angst in
big space.  Gardner knows something about cowboys and how they dress.
Wil Alexander delivers fresh lines of defense for tropicalism north of
Sunset and Canal, variations on never saying anything you could not
mean if you had the time to stare for days at cawcaws, Lamantia
lizards, stuff. He loves poesies and shows it, and even better, talks
it when he does his "prose" intros and so forth.  Fanny Howe, who
might be wearing sunglasses now, employs a term like "soul" in
polished ovular forms that cover no language we can understand
equivocally, tanning with HD. I want to pick through those ovals and
spin them in my right hand, Queeglike. <p>

 Sat.: vocabularies and imaginations panel -- missed this.
Biography/criticism panel -- missed.  Missed the noontime reading too,
but the buzz is that Gerrit Lansing is a wonder, fully clothed in
Boston haberdashery, Blackmountain tie. (Will get details on this,
later.) <p>

 Afternoon reading a Boston phenomenon that occurs every other
generation. Last time, perhaps, was during Hurricane Carol (or
someone's) when John Wieners swept into Charles Street Meetinghouse to
attend his first ever poetry gig, that : to hear Charles Olson read
every poem he -- Charles, that is -- had written up to that point.  He
read for hours and hours, and John and poetry have never been the
same.  (Two generations before that: Henry James revised brother
William's application to Harvard.) <p>

 Among the readers this Saturday afternoon:  Zhang Er reading in
Mandarin and Leonard Schwartz offering the crispest English versions.
John Taggart moaning on the blues, repetition, feeding and leading,
singing soft, singing "precious," and the mother of it all, the blues,
having her vision of how to give it birth -- one that includes, I
think, our hearing Taggart moaning "preceeeeessuss" on. A genuine
history and a poem performed as a piece! Unstoppably first rate.
Chris Funkhouser also singing, bridegroom to his skeleton, flooding
the room with a sutra that is not a sutra from nowhere, moving it
gracefully on.  Caroline Knox tearing into writers' pretensions such
as, to paraphrase, "composing" a stark language framework and "going
back" and filling it with "content."   Knox got some of the biggest
laughs, deservedly. Sean Cole got lots of laughs too and a few
cardiovascular molecules had to have imploded -- someone's, somewhere
-- at Cole's most astonishingly diverse send-ups  -- Dickens, house
plant life, teen lust, three-family crisscrossed dreams, warped
dials... well it's finely warped into a poetry and a poetic presence
not unlike his precursors, Ricard, O'Hara, Artaud. Rare.  Andrea Brady
stands as tall as you want while she rips your pea-brain (mine,
anyway) into smithereens, flowing, protoliterate incursions into
inchoate bliss and something opposite -- isn't this what we all need
now? <p>

 The afternoon and the conference have been the greatest sort of
success, pairing the established with the not-quite-yet, just what a
serious gathering of poets should be.  The spotlight shines until late
tonight.  More soon. Call you soon, <p>

From:         daniel bouchard <bouchard@MIT.EDU><br>
Subject:      Came to Cambridge: Not Bean-ville<br>

When the New York poets come into town you've got to lie about Time
and Space. For example, a New England poet who lives 10 minutes from
the Conference Space will tell the New York poets that the Conference
Space is a ten minute walk. The New England poet plans to leave for
the Conference Space about fifteen minutes before the starting
time. OK, say the New York poets. At 18 minutes before the starting
time, however, the New York poets decide they each need a shower. The
New England poet will never learn.  <p>

 But this is cool (not to mention exaggerated) and only mentioned as a
starting point. We--Drew, Douglas, Dave, and I--made the walk with no
problem save that Harvahd Yahd was blocked off by construction fences
on the interior so that we had to skirt along the alleys of the Yard
and miss the strange clichi of its bucolic interior. We arrived just
as Aaron was speaking which gave us, me at least, no time to talk to
anyone. This is ideal when reading.  <p>

 Some places from which people traveled for the alternative Boston
conference this weekend at 56 Brattle Street, a limestone's throw from
the Longfellow House: New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Buffalo,
Providence, San Francisco, and Japan.  <p>

 What was learned?  <p>

 1) Only poets would spend a 3 day weekend in a hot and cramped room
for up to, or over, 12 hours a day on a beautiful, sunny weekend and
be very excited about it. <p>

 2) If the conference is deemed "alternative," then anything goes. I
slipped a Robert Frost poem into my reading ("The Vantage Point") and
heard a distinct, pleasurable "hmphh" come from outside the veil of
U-V lights. It was my backyard; I had to do it. <p>

 I decided not to read the short poem about how lousy it is to be in a
room full of milling poets. This is because I was a reader, and that
produces a kind of rush for me. Besides, my "I Make a Pact with you
Ron Silliman" poem fell flat. Not a giggle was heard. People told me
later that I read it as something very serious, but I have always
cried the tears of a clown.  <p>

 Drew's reading was fantastic. It is unusual that I was able to hear
it (having just read, and playing back my own reading--so
egocentrically!--in my mind) but his opening was sharp and
irresistable: "I can tell by the way you dress that you're a cowboy."
(Roughly.) And his reading was paced so that in the silences I became
expectant of the poems, waiting, paying more attention; and as Drew
read more, the energy soared.  <p>

 During Will Alexander's reading I must admit that I lapsed into
space. I bounced back for Fanny Howe however. I was so engrossed by
her reading that when she stopped I thought my watch was dead. She
only read for 10-15 minutes. It seemed, richly, like much longer. And
I wanted more. <p>

 During the milling bit after the reading a Harvard Lit Comp
prof. approached me with the usual chat and asked for poems. No
problem. Then she explains, as she hands me her business card, that
she is waiting for her mother to die ("she will not, eternally, ever
give in. She refuses to die!") so she can take her inheritance and
publish poetry. (And people probably think I am sour for the little
poem about "milling poets" but I am sure you each have your own
stories to tell.) Having nothing to answer this strange remark I stand
smiling, nodding, scanning the room with my eyes. Peter Ganick tells
me he loved my line about "the way cowboys dress." (Should I tell him?
Should I tell him?) I tell him that line was actually Drew Gardner's
line which causes him a visceral spasm of embarrassment. (It had to be
done.)  <p>

 On the walk to the car Prageeta and Maggie discuss lesbian dress
protocol which has an emphasis on practicality. As I never dress with
an objective other than practicality (i.e., comfort) I one-up them on
the entire aesthetic by adding, "besides I don't give a fuck what I
look like" wearing green shorts, a black T-shirt (both of which are
drenched), old running sneakers and ankle-high socks. This boldness
earns me the epithet of "Dan: the Complete Lesbian" which I revel in
for a night.  <p>

 Meanwhile, my friend Sven from Cambridge (a Spenser scholar) and
Douglas grab a ride with Richard. Richard is filming the entire
conference for some reason. In the car Sven notices a hat from
Washington & Lee--a college in Virginia renowned for old-boy
fraternities and inbred aristocracy. The hat produces apprehension in
Sven, and he hopes it does not come up in conversation. But Douglas
has already picked up on its motto (which I disremember) and inquires
of it of Richard. As it turns out, Richard and Sven both "spent time"
there, and may likely be (despite their generation differences) the
only two alums never to have belonged to a fraternity. They discuss
later, at Michael Franco's, a shared hate for a certain Milton
professor.  <p>

 The party is fine. We get home ok in the crowded car, with Douglas in
the trunk. I give Maggie and Prageeta directions to the Mass Pike, but
Dave Kirschenbaum prefers not to make the short walk from the bridge,
so Maggie and Prageeta end up getting lost for many hours. We don't
see them again till well into the next day.  <p>

 In the morning I make juice for everyone (oranges and grapes,
straight up--very rich), and we arrive during the panel almost on
time. I cannot process anything being said so I try to focus by making
sketches of the panelists. I gauge my success by showing the
caricatures to Isabel Franco (sitting next to me) as I go. I am
feeling better when manna from heaven drops into my lap in the form of
a scone, placed with a "whump" from behind me by Douglas.  <p>

 Some things I remember: Joseph Lease's metaphor about how the Cold
War was two dogs facing each other, and the Post-Cold War a single dog
in which we are all micro-organisms. This guy can think on his feet I
think. But he dilutes this perception by announcing that he had
thought of it earlier and even collaborated on it by phone with Jordan
Davis. Still, he's saying intelligent things, as are all the
panelists.  <p>

 Despite a dangerous level of exhaustion I enjoy the afternoon
readings. Gerrit Lansing is fantastic. He is my new model for
reading. Beth is great, as is Andrea; the two reminding me of each
other in their delivery: low, even tone of long (or long-ish)
lines. Joe Torra is high-energy. Zhang Er is good, and Caroline Knox
is funny.  <p>

 >From the bio panel I mostly take comfort in Kristen's presentation
that Helen Adam worked a dull job in which she was able to get a lot
done during down time. I decide I like Helen Adam a lot and will seek
out her work. I get this also from Lyman Gilmore's presentation on
Joel Oppenheimer, whom I have not read much of. Then I take off to a
bar with Patrick Doud to cool off with a margarita, which is
refreshing for about fifteen minutes, but I nearly pass out later
during the evening readings. In fact I was probably saved from doing
so by Lisa Jarnot's and Lewis Warsh's reading. Warsh's "Secret Police"
had me stitches; Lisa's chinchilla and other animal poems had me in a
pleasant catatonic state. Kristin Prevallet's footnote poem also
created this effect. Untitled, I suggested to her: "A poem of
not-so-useful information."     <p>

 Another party at Michael and Isabel's Saturday night. I crash for an
hour in an empty room, waking up glad to find the Buffalo/Toronto guys
had not drawn on my forehead, and also finding Christian crashed
(vampire-like: body straight, arms folded in X on chest) on the floor
across the room.  <p>

 Outside there is literary chat. And Dave Kirschenbaum putting
together his instant 'zine on a laptop in a cloud of mosquitoes by the
porch light. The literary chat gets controversial: Douglas argues with
Alan about Paradise Lost. Alan, in a manner reminiscent of Steve
Evans, sits calmly and accepts Douglas' points and then evenly returns
his own. The crux: what line does Milton's epic hinge on & is Satan a
hero? Alan is firm: better to reign in hell than serve in
heaven. Douglas does not accept. It goes back and forth, bringing
Dante, Chaucer, and Chomsky (a la Drew and Bill Howe) marginally into
the picture. Hanging back I suggest "to justify God's ways to man"
which Andrea seconds. (As I was not centrally involved in this
argument, I'll cease its narrative here.)  <p>

 Because I am the only one not to have had a drink all night, I drive
the car home. It's tight and we gather Will Alexander and Aaron from
the driveway top where they had been waiting for a cab. Douglas gets
into the trunk again, Aaron sits on Dave in the passenger seat and
away we go. Another thing learned from the weekend: an overcrowded car
with the conference organizer's head protruding from an open window
does not sit well with Arlington police. As I pull over with the blue
lights and siren screaming behind us, Aaron queries (from outside the
car) "why are we pulling over here? Who are we dropping off here?" <p>

 It was difficult to ascertain whether the cops were poetry fans. I
mean, I could have said "it's cool, officer, we have Will Alexander in
the car" but I'm not sure how that would have played out.  <p>

 So, as the cops approached, one on each side, I announce sternly to
the excited passengers: "everyone shut the fuck up." One cop asks me
if I am aware how many seat belt laws I am breaking. One per person
except me I think to myself but say nothing. I give him my
license. Hess fumbles (unsuccessfully) for his Missouri
registration. The officers (one male, one female) note aloud how
dangerous our driving situation is, and then huddle up back at the
cruiser to ensure our Dodge Shadow is not stolen. As they confer in
swirling blue lights, Aaron announces that he and Will can walk from
that point and he wishes us well. I tell Aaron that it's probably not
advisable to walk away from the scene at that particular moment.  <p>

 To be short, the cops let us off without even requesting an intimate
acquaintance with my breath. We leave two by the road while we drop
off another two and return for the other two shortly. As I was handed
back my license it didn't even occur to me that the law officers will
forever remain unaware of Douglas Rothschild, now grown very quiet,
cooped up in the hatch-back trunk. Later, Douglas noted that the
incident constituted a good adventure, and it would make Bill Luoma
proud.  <p>

 On Sunday I outted SubPress in the publishing panel. Preceding this
debut were fine presentations by Kirschenbaum (the traveling/instant
magazine), Douglas Messerli (brief history of Sun&Moon), Peter Ganick
(brief history of Potes&Poets), Chris Funkhouser (on Internet
publishing and E-things in general), and Joe Torra (on his magazine
"lift").  <p>

 I began by showing off books received thru the "Self-Publish or
Perish" initiative, and note how the project grew out of a community;
how it all was (my involvement anyway) an extension of MASS AVE.,
which grew out of a sense of community that began at the Fitterman
Poetry Talks in 1996, the Buffalo Poetics list, and then the
Subpoetics list (at which point I thumbnail for people what a listserv
is). RESULTS: A lot of people want to inspect the SelfPub books after
the panel. A lot of people want to know how to get onto the "Buffalo
list thing," and many more people want to know where to send money for
the "SubPress" thing. I take their addresses instead.  <p>

 Someone (Maria Damon?) tells me her initial thoughts of what the
publishing panel would consist of was "how to get published." It was
not so. It was more a testimony of doing things oneself, how to seek
out or define your community thru print and initiative (as Torra's
presentation manifested, and Michael Franco--contrib editor to
lift--supported with comments in the audience). I was happy with it.
<p>

 There were many great readings Sunday: Rosmarie Waldrop, Joseph
Lease, Patrick Doud, Charles Bernstein, Damon Krukowski, Peter Ganick
and others; some of which I caught portions of, or missed due to
extreme unction, I mean extreme exhaustion.  <p>

 The weekend ended for me in a seafood restaurant near my house with
Beth, Maggie, Drew and Douglas. I had the fish and chips.  <p>

 After they left for the bus, I went back to the reading and then to
the party where I talked with Cambridge poet Jim Dunn (who traded my
cop/poetry story with his own, in which a Boston bike cop runs into
his car while he is driving John Wieners to the supermarket; "oh
christ!" John exclaims) and Heater Scott Peterson (a painter, poet,
bookbinder, and ex-student of Ange Mlinko's).  <p>

 Other participants or attendees are encouraged/requested to fill in
gaps or post their own narratives and perceptions to supplement this
woeful inadequacy.  <p>
