                      "Defy the Sky"

     It is too current to be detected. She dresses to be
tormented, but... It would have astonished him to know.
     But you checked if she was interested, keeping your eyes
always wide, your finger on the thin chain.
     Tim rounds on the lot of them. All was uniform... a
little dribble of spittle.
     Did she see the darkness in your gun? Zar turns true to
his name. The one in tears, the other laughing a cool stream
-- sharp distinctions are unwilling to be made. Interesting,
ist es nicht, mein Freund?
     The evolved one sighs, seeming very wall between them.
Can one blame Oedipus for his abyss?
     Zar promises, Sorry, but... He indicates Tim. The
glistening praised his genuine enough virility, orders
continued more living elsewhere than in the mind.
     Tim gleefully collapses. His voice, never clearer, mad
with failure, sabersharp and bloodscalded, carves its
message into our broken inheritance: Unashamed, it says, in
unbounded laughing breaths, I live in light.
     Two step forward. One the Attorney, the other the
Knight. Tim's fear stands shimmering above his body,
beckoning. Zar wraps home long-term revenge. Perfect justice,
he can tell, will be altered by the new equilibrium.  Hands
form shadows over hearts as he lies intricate involutions:

Unrelaxed

The chorus has died, and returning sleep
transcends the desire for anything.
An image, decked in memory, wanders the path
within herself: the path you have labored to create.

It is muddy, and her boots sink into the blank
soil between the orange trees. Gasping, the moon
dirties itself in a desperate attempt to hide.
Obedient, the orange trees all let fall.

A speaker moves to the podium, located
at the head of the path. The birds
have hidden in the trees, defenseless in their
nests, and await as audience.

You watch through a tragic window, far above
all of the other watchers, even the moon.
Dominion sits heavy on your eyelids,
small and immortal.

Now there is nothing, only an awakening. A broken song.
All is quiet. The dead things are gone.
There are no oranges on the trees, nor on the ground,
nor anywhere.

It did not thunder in the grove that evening.
There was only,
                one with fire in her eyes.

     Herself! the Attorney bows slightly, intently towards
Zar. Holy space and unholy time demand it.
     Zar gathers his goads in for the evening. Such
distinctions refuse to be made -- space and time are one
chair in which you must sit. Damning, isn't it, my friends?
     The evolved one cries, seeming melting glacier surround
them. Can one blame Agamemnon for his hard-on?
     Zar permits, You --
     You cannot defy the sky! screams Tim, rising, like hot
air; storming out, like a lyrical hurricane of love.
     Moved, the Attorney and the Knight gather into each
others arms. They weep as they embrace, and they kiss,
tenderly. The evolved one is transported into heaven.
     Zar fondles discreetly his knife. She was magnificent!
The timid ones must die.

October 31

devices are working but worthless,
combined in a compilation, a pile,
a towering monolith, a phallus,
a message to america of complication
and harmony in work and spending dollars

on air time, channeled through a tunnel underground
where workers plough through layers of lode
and lay wires to connect and separate those above,
way up above in the open air;

time rolled in negative layers, concern
for Friday's arrival and checks locked
at the back door constantly guarded,
and waiting on break, sitting with a stare
over heads and beyond resounding voices.

November 15

Scanning into eyes, almost ripped and fired
but long and accidental, wondering as washed.

Too late for patience wasted water
dripping faucet open blood wounds;
Ribs smothered sheets sticking covers wet and dirty.

But before warm or secure but hostile home warning
life worm boringblessed and superstitious.

Ambulance trucking wheat disintigrate farm for spreading
and factory plumage, feathers flown brown mud.

November 16

Washing saved skin scrubbed raw, wringing,
front door opening heard closed forgotten locked.

Half-naked, vulnerable, admitted:
strangeness in solidarity like radio conversation,
spotlights bare stage dusty waxed.

Sterile organized hidden comparison with
cold water left running and then dripping overnight
unnoticed, invisible, except for sound.
