with doors the woods would not
be woods where they end
not always knowing
the knocking the interlocked
branches

a question is
permission a soft
field cricket
under your finger
branches
locking across your palm

edged by corn stalk sounds
in wind i am you
soft
cricket singing
the lock of us
wielding (song) too solid
to fully compass
a rock
permitting entry to pressure
moss on its smooth
surface no branches

she is confused when she is
that small cricket her legs
rubbing not knowing
beyond grass stalks or what
makes green
heat or day light
a smooth surface
to press against (like) a rock
with no fissures to rest
in she is out
in blue air under the sun she is afraid
(to call attention) and yet

cannot
stop

she is double-natured wanting solid
in a green field soft
(as)  grass filtered through wind

F-R-E-E-D-O-M-C-O-M-P-U-T-E-R

--an invocation to the
Techno-Muse


Your screen is a stretch of beach. Words are
shell-fragments, crunching under the hammer of
your fingers.

* * *

Your screen is the night-time woods, your hands
small animals foraging in the brush.

* * *

Your screen is still water.  A school of fish
effervesce its glassy depths.

* * *

Your keys are the bones of a thousand dead. Your
fingers are souls dancing happily upon them.

* * *

Your screen is the inner curve of a skull, the
capsules of stored sensations propel themselves
within its amber caverns.

* * *
Your screen is an open plain. Numberless wild
horses thunder out of the hills toward your face.

* * *

Your screen is thickening smoke. Your fingers are
flames lapping the smouldering keys.

* * *

Your screen is a rib cage, and you are the heart
beating and echoing within its chamber.

* * *

Your screen is a holy temple, your hands the
worshippers at its portals.

* * *

Your screen is an open sky over a field. You are a
kestrel cutting through it on sharpened wings, and
its prey panicked in the grass below.

* * *

Your screen is the eye of heaven. Angels scale its
margins. Their wings sweep against the keys like
beatitudes. You are one of their company.

* * *

Eros Rising

tell me again how we met, rows
of brownstones, boxes, a tracking of wires
in smoulder-light. you are my
musec. i want
to give you postcards, a small
pair of party gloves. a scarf. a scroll. this ring
                                          of keys.
take my hand, isis-drop
part my poor seas. tonight
there it all was, spilled
like treasure from the envelope.
               the singer i know
opens his mouth. when the angels
hear his song, they stop
their dancing. dance for all my lilies.
how did we meet again?
you are sky sounds.  imprint
of wings flapping ground level
who are you today?
it's as if the whole world
were his thigh and i could just
clasp it. tongue my way over
its surface. it's cream
for this parched throat.
it's delicious and unfurls me
in hillocks and smooth streams. careening. ow. ow.
it readies me for its own taking.

The Procession

Slap-lizzard tattoo neck in the opening rose!
These palms are psychic and the lines that streak
across them are nothing but human.  Metallic
strips of leather becomes the singular feather, a
simple fetish, in contemporary American heritage.
March, marching, movement in D major somewhat
allegria...the Procession!   Shopping carts,
pioneers, expansionists, gold-diggers, and
metaphors.  Then the chiggers, and the blue lines
on yellow paper.  Trot, gallup, doorbell.  Souls
chained by the sea.  The procession commences!
Step one, step two, step three.  Three step
waterfalls on Willett Street!  The silver flash in
New York and step one, overlooking apartments.
Always the flash.  Procession of fires.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Hooks and Cylinders

I have been thinking about hooks and cylinders and
Hat Creek skepticism, but nothing could repair the
chronological order.  The word "Seduction" is an
attempt to answer the contemporaries; the
hierarchy of Isis and Poseidon (and later Neptune)
all demand a seaport.  So it becomes unfortunate
that most anglers have a detrimental effect upon
the stream, a great experience like a fragment of
a song.  At any rate, money is interesting.  The
splendor of stretched sunlight in the afternoon
rather impressive rather Spanish, Andalusian in
the rosemary and basil.  You may ask:  is there
any original nostalgia?  Help restore the
holiness!  Self-defense through creativity from a
small, persistent canvas.  I have been thinking
about hooks and cylinders and impressions from the
underwater angels.  Wild river through high red
canyons and thousands of buzzards, circling.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Palms in the Texture of Wind

Palms in the texture of wind, a domus, home, or
interesting book of poems and 3:00 a.m., the talk
completely still; or am I to be refused in the
process of grief?  The arrows come wearily in
order to equal the great depressions.  Power then,
whether you be a goddess or tread on a branch in
the grove.  A truly whole humanity, jaguar
exulting in victory, the highlands blazing, white
hair drying up.  This shapes complicated
demarcations and suppressed memory.  Lucky to have
suffered the wounds, groaning in unrecognized
devotion.  O blood sheltering tree, the sun has
fallen and the shores pronounce a specific hue of
green and the leaves have frozen to stone.  Allay
the mango, the totem.  My pocket is filled with
plans so to meet would suggest language dressed
completely in memoirs or memories, simply
deceptive.  Besides, this is merely personal, a
chaotic variation of form deciphered by the
morning light.  This was an Egyptian statue and
the passage now is loaded with common faults.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The Moon-Room

To mention something simple:  saffron or abysmally
approaching twilight, one or two artists hope
there is a foundation of Truth.  Damn it all!  The
mood spoiled into sensual flowers, fixed,
obsessive; or love incarnated resembling that
Mendocino Coast or that similar important
struggle.  Transparencies belong to the river, the
body only in part a river:  in part fire flesh
bone voice.  My heart is all stained with
blackberries.  Random insecurities; imperfections
gleam.  Tromos, or a sudden trembling.  The tides
rise and below us wide stingrays forage.  My
selective desire is to be standing in a slate of
rain or flanked by waves.  Simplicity has gotten
all tangled up in vitreous perceptions.  My hands
wish your mysterious mouth to body, Eros ablaze,
the moon-room ablaze, your clitoris molten lava.
The ceremony grows green, fills the air as the
daughters are changed into vines though it sounds
past belief.  All night long the sea absorbs
ghosts and sings in discordant harmonies.

----------------------------------------------------------------

People (self?)

People (self?) out of touch with time or meteor
showers after the moon in October.  Animal.  Cold
under the maples; leaves burning red through a
crisp air.  A return to splitting wood and tugging
our donkey through the soccer field.  Flight in
the sun of lavender robes.  The difficulty is in
the hurry.  The bark of a dog.  If I walk with you
on this beach sand, will the columns of rock fall?
Where is the monastery?  The light is covered in
footsteps.  But we were speaking of Canada, and
Oregon, where the rock of columns stand.  And one
of the seven streams.  How long, how meditative
must it disturb, or a Buddha on a photo.  The holy
men are out in force beneath a blazing sky.  And
the rock-fish has bloody gills from the jabs of
spear.  I always seem to return to a similar
place, out place, out of touch with time.  Flash.

My Sister's House

I sit on the couch in my
sister's living room and realize:
she is still six years older than me,
weaned from my parents earlier,
some mistakes they'll never make again

my mother thinks as
she plans my future and
asks me what I want to do
with my life and what will
make me happy and all the responsibilities
I have to make and pay for
and plan for and look forward to
what?

                What lies ahead of tomorrow
in a society I alienate myself from
I know because it tries so damn hard
to take me in and make me happy
and rich but all I can see
is ambivalence and ignorance and I know
that they are just words and

I make myself unhappy
with these thoughts that come from
who knows where, maybe something
bad from the Bible or that
Rock Music dope dealing Pink Floyd
kids that will ruin this country
and everything it is and stands for
our children to grow up and appreciate
is all ruined because these damn kids

go out and look and see
what is really there,
even though our every day
practiced have a nice days,
now who could beat that?
Even the glorious technology,
a gift from the brilliant minds
of Our Generation put to waste
by troublemakers and perverts and MTV --

long-haired lunatics taking up too
much time between Our commercials
that clearly show them how life
should really be, let's forget
the pornography of Christ in Piss
and homosexuality and marijuana
because we know it's wrong --
how can we call that art
when America is really Norman Rockwell,
-- I know it's true it was
never that way when I was young.

A college kid on state
financial-aid,
I sleep in a bunked bed
and look out a window
at carefully manicured lawns
and stone fences and rows
of cars and buildings being
built and potholes in roads
fixed and a recycled garbage
dumpster.

Is this America, I ask;
it must be it says on the map
and the tv that sits in the corner:
I watched Dan Rather for five years
every night he told me America
was something else, like
Miami Vice and Tom Sellek
with guns and sports cars
racing in paradise.

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The window glow yellow from streetlamps
casting shadowed squares on her
glass coffee table;
I fall asleep
in my sister's foreign home.

poem Defenestration of Prague

==============================================================
Inter\face is:

*Inter\face 3 is a publication of
poetry, what we take that to be in
relationship to our investment in
the fact that the word is not so
much written down now as it is down
loaded or it exists momentarily
between cursors late in the night's
impermanent cybermind.(ky)

*Cyberspace has been termed a new
"frontier" by many, a new space that
needs to be explored and mapped. We
offer a collection of perspectives
on this viewpoint, a way to look at
the net, at life, incorporating
technology and humanity.
(bh)

*i am in my new sweater.  i am at a
keyboard.  sometimes this small
corpus imprisons sometimes offers
new rooms.  the screen to me is a
room.  a series of quiet
conversations late at nite or early
a.m.  sometimes it becomes easier to
read screen words than book words.
to watch them float toward you from
ephermeral agitation.(nd)

*We're not anti-intellectual.
*We do promote:  the letter press,
the etching, the lithograph (old) &
laborious (body) printing processes
*We have to acknowledge the
limitations of thoughts so finely
stored in their (material) casings
that they don't make it out into the
late twentieth century.
*I want to talk ie. there is a place
to talk - seemingly an a crest of
"spontaneous prosody" that is much in
the keeping with a tradition of
lyrical poetry which seeks to define,
to glorify, to tell, to heighten,
to worship, to soothe, to pray,
to gather the strength we have
left to care - gather in the words ---

*Words, language, data stream: we
encounter these things daily, accept
them or reject them. This is an
offering, a contribution, a step
toward our ever-changing, temporary
definition. We encompass and gather
and collect to present. (bh)

*we are seeing new meanings course
from curser light.  we are learning
each day to speak in this new
vision-voice. (nd)
