he fell into the trough:  to melt her face
against the wall "bed of lists".
I say that. can't comfort me.  she gets the
urge to be vulgar - meshes - divination
rinsing smoke in the childish field.

fingers understand hands
borne from the trees
I love this thing

Now I dream in text, floating

Inter\face is physical; I can touch it.

Illinois Retrograde

Dead grass/candles/a fire in the woods.
Two mouths open and staring in at the
flames in the freezing cold, warming
themselves as the snow starts up. And
no one realizing I woke up to the
rocking backward.

No one believes you when you say the
will has been separated, when there are
pieces of things and nothing whole. A
surface disguising a bruise

(So the preface reads, two roads next
to each other on a stage. The speaker
moves above one for each particular
monologue. One's facing the mountains,
one's facing flatlands, fields of corn
up to your knees.

You could say they mean exactly
opposite things. The flatland a return
to innocence, the mountains a desperate
escape to overcome it. But it's the
same thing)

Back and forth it's the same thing.
An ocean of stars.
Cement roads breaking down, running for
the woods.

Two bodies in a wood house in the
mountains and she can do nothing but
record details. The smell of wood
burning and the sound of its collapse.
The lamps made out of tin cans. The
lake freezing.

ballooning outward/ like a body sore
from reclaiming

Lucy in the Sky Doesn't Live Here
Anymore: The Sequel

You sit
belly on your lap
facing your computer
lawyer-shirt strewn over
the back of the
old couch.

You smell
of cigarettes
and car fresheners
as you stare and stare
straight into the screen,
taking a second out of
every few
to smoke another cigarette
out in the garage
or make a comment
about the television show
filling the family room.

You will be sitting there
until maybe eleven or twelve at night
then get into bed
reluctantly,
with a new day of litigation
or client meetings
ahead.

How did magic tricks
and teaching me to use the wok
drawing me pictures to show me
the principle of time travel
become this?
How did you
lose your childhood altogether?
Mom says:
back when daddy had a personality...
but you do still, you must.

The man in the undershirt
once wrote poetry
i know, i have a copy of the booklet
it wasn't great poetry,
but it rang of your inner depth
your mental strength
that I have always admired.

You once had a brother
who I never got to meet
he was crushed by a truck
when he was sixteen years old
and you have never mentioned him to me.
You used to light up smiling
young and full of dreams
all the time.
Despite your younger brother
who I think you purely forgot.
How much of your brightness did you
bury with your baby brother?

Or were you happy --
Grandma always liked him better.
How much of your brightness remains?

Now you pour your brightness
into the computer
you let it sing to you in the garage
with your cigarettes
but you don't put my finger
in the make believe guillotine
anymore or show me how
you can make a little gold
butterfly locket
appear out of thin air.
You put that locket around my neck
and I told everybody
that daddy did magic
at the living room table
just for his little girl.
That was when you were
my infallible daddy
that was when i didn't
wonder about your past
your inner feelings
that was when you came
before any other man in my life.
Somewhere that changed.

Now
Every once in a while
you embrace me
or tell me a joke
or play ghost with me
and I see daddy again.
Why can't I be your
little girl anymore?
Why doesn't you magical computer
astound me
as did your magical tricks?

we wash ourselves
but from where we started
in the crinkled ocean waves
in the corral reef
under the sweet bed light
winding carving my way thru
your mountain valleys
searching for forbidden city
between sanctuaries
hand over hand
except for regulars
there is no balance or contradiction
which finds itself ringing
in tabernacle urgency
we grow to carrier pigeons
saving face

a bridge in nowhere
for people i am
to take them back to
nowhere but i care about nowhere

Window

1.      I look out from a view
        not including myself
        except one shoulder,
        two hands, a lap -
        I feel hair -- imagine a
        reflection,     faintly:

Apples creating caterpillar webs,
shreds, spillage
semen strewed about the room,
I declare necessary
-something-
specific presentation, ode(or)
intimate,
a frost would/could no closer touch
nimbly, nimbly
                follow close
          imagine fallow fodder,
                simplicity --
                wave form(at) [and]
                         boca-mouth-art
        suspension
                         tongue-checked
                        (So I am)

whipped, snap, attack, flow,
angry me to(o) lean close [if ever]
I knew : the distance!
Shimmering like lightning, striking
notes of discord unsounded,
traced in [white] light,
outlined by a deep, blue sky.

II.     I know this reflection
        must not end, I allow
        her purification smoke
        to cleanse.

C.      frozen lattice clings
        to smooth surface,

        tumbling, trembling,

        watching the sky for power
                surges, melting heat-
        the pot handle,
                        boiling steam,

        (visible.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Tomorrow.

Grant it, darn it, grant it,
wait for the apocalypse, forgotten,
those outdoor elements fixed,
the cement holds their path-rail,

trodden, crowded,
I look for an exit sign,        glowing,
                                glowering
redAngryMad
                                above me,
                                over the
                                doorway...

I do not notice the people dash by,
they are running from crumbling ruins,
toward the forest, taking the highway,

(umber midden, streamy, teary-eyed,
lash beaten, frogged, stampede!;)

-call out for that echo-

-wait for its return-

Lottery Luck

     Sucking my batteries that were
charged by photovoltaics.  I try not to
think this when I think, but it's true.
     I pat my pocket.  Mini-array still
there.  I've got a full charge but I 'm
still nervous.  This could be a lollg
story.
     It started when I won the lottery,
don't you know.  Everything starts with
money, I'm not stupid.  It was a
special lottery lump sum and all.
Suddenly in my lap, a couple of
million.  I never bothered to count.
     I'd always wanted to be one with
everything.  I'm a Zen going way back.
Read the Tao of Pooh, don't you know.
Owl is my hero.  Smart guy.
     So I hired this scientist.  He
said he was well qualified. Something
about neuro-physics, neuro-networks,
neuro-stanford doctorate. Meant nothing
to me.  I just called him doc.  He
didn't mind.  He only wanted money.
     I guess that's the problem.  He
said he could have given me a better
battery if he had more money.  Could've
made it possible to trigger Implant (I
call it my higher self) with my mind
(what ever that is) instead of
something he called a physically
stimulated activation switch. "You
mean, like a light switch so I can turn
on the light in my head?"  I thought it
was funny.  He said he could have put a
self-diagnostic in; keep me healthy and
make me live longer, he said.  Too bad
I didn't have any more money.  He even
said he could give me perfect memory.
You guessed it, more money.
     So I win a lottery, (don't
remember entering) and all I have left
is a bit of silicon in my body and some
batteries that will only accept charge
for another 2 years.  I wonder what
part of me has all the stuff? I used to
know.  Sure do need that memory
enhancer.  Need money.
     What, do I put a want-ad on some
network? (or even the paper!) Youth
with able body and very able, computer
enhanced mind needs work. Who's hire
me?  McDonalds, but they'll hire
anyone, any time, always. Must be some
kind of universal truth.

Vase From a Pillow Book

The working fluid must
be contained in these
erotic vessels of an
adequate size and shape
for the physics in hand and
made of cormorants and
humming-birds in human form,
one of them preparing a
liquid in a little receptacle
over a bonfire and stirring
it with some implement, while
a cormorant lifts a
vessel in an arbor of a
man and woman making love,
but it has characteristics
that we do not find in other
cultures, in the presence of flames,
this radiation will mainly be
extremely soft cloud tracks.
