VINCENT FERRINI
     Decline of the Obsolete


There is a death that does not sleep

hanging around as a mal-odor

between the fissures of decaying wings


variations of cliches in homes

by the Merchants of Metaphysics

Emporia the Sun is blinking at


that this is only a transitory Theatre

the hour of weighing of the soul on the scale

approaching, Hierachies collecting


repositories of whoring Ink at large

the plateus of the Unquestioning

Insurances against Death & oblivion


the ache in the messages of the signs

& the rejoicing springs of Innocence

*************************
<a name="ferriniabout"></a>
Vincent's Ferrini's Fortieth Book
Thomas Lowe Taylor


Listening to him talk about vocation during a reading, you realize he's
talking about the Stations of Attention, locating the moods and sensations
via voice of states of being which attend from a complete world view, one
which includes his corporeal chakras and an enlivened and illumined eros.
 No, we are not listening to erotic poetry, but to poetry from an erotically
enlivened man, in whom vital energies are successfully utilized in erasing
the poet's body from the physical body and so blur the inner/outer illusion.
 "I am the poem...we are all the poem...." he says expansively, noting that
it was in the mutuality of his friendship with Olson that his sense of what
poetry does was made firm, not by who Olson was, certainly a contributing
factor to the depth it achieved, but more in the fact of friendship that the
word became flesh.

And so Vincent inhabits all religions in his embracing of them, and not with
any attitude at all save the tonality of his line, be it brief or vernacular
or pure juice, it is all cosmos and he is its evidence.  This is ecstatic
poetry.

Vincent is a manifestation of the sacred and complete man, saying that he is
"a communicator", perhaps enlivening the notion of what a poet is, he
inhabits the personal with his Word, noting that for the most part, we have
lost touch with it.

But if you aren't somewhere, that is, manifesting yourself, all of 
this takes place in a vacuum--hence Vincent's sense of community, of being
somewhere, interacting with other people in their lives.   His poetry is a
poetry of voice, of encounters, of a life lived fully among and within other
people.  "A person is a person because of other people" goes the saying.  No
ivory tower here.

The poems strike not like artifice, but as true speech, sometimes embellished
by poetic effect.  A word is a just cause, not to be misused or misplaced, in
each place made specific by its use.  In much that is about today, the
plasticity of material is so disrespectfully used as to deny many "word
products" their vitality.

To have a poetry which is not out of one's life and vision is to write
someone else's poetry, or perhaps no ones, perhaps it is just "to write".

Word as flesh, not as signifier.

A STAY IN ACCELERATION
======================     By David Hunter Sutherland 


On stilts, Cyrano courts Neptune,
blind to the
time-worn cracks and
centuries coarse ephesias, 
of her moons. Gone this view
of her suns,
In my absence,
behind half-opened doors
Susanna finishes Figaro, 
Daedalus takes wing,
and the price of cloves falter..

Stay !
this beaten path,
balm it with a  lullaby,
and Spring it too a halt,
In my absence.
(shiploads will burn..)


Letter To Valentinius (c.140)
==========================          By David Hunter Sutherland

Beloved,

She wriggles of life.
Wrapped in a palm, 
pale like gypsum's
flakes of ivory.
She wriggles of life,
carved in the harsh erotics and
pews whose albumens of flesh
awe back her prescence....

Belonging,
on her first day 
belonging,
her mouth was yours,
her lips, 
statutes of a testatment
of a tribe gone mad.

Beloved,
bring me your visions
your allusion on mule,
your fires' brightest Channels
(Meshach, Shadrach, Abdenago)
your psychic, high on
wooden monocles 
whose talk of 
animal theism, desert terror, phantasm,
are veins in the cataclysms of her palm.
This world is 
enough 
my love, 
tell the believers
your daughter has name.

Faithfully yours,
<a name="ferrini"></a>

      Paean for Jake Berry's 3rd Note


The waves are underswayed

underoperating implied


the sounds hit the walls

of listening & the digitals bouncing off


in directions lost feet grapple for

to round out a footprint


so it can be found where it came from

but it's already gone


the knockings try to hold

even as the syllable sinks in the ozone


all's open as the air is sucking for

the news to make a chancing


tangents are glintings of the Glorious

talking reassembles


speaking briefly as a cat scratch left

on the cerebellum for posterity


the gas in value's pushed Joy off the edge

& the audience is suspended in unhearing


the atmosphere is alienated from the ore 

& nothing stays for long in any thing


Schooling is a ritual of the marketplacing

Imagination is stuck in grease


politics have eyeballs hanging

out of white skulls borrowed from cliches


the revolution is a fast backward

so far ahead the language is groping


Ah but the energy is freed

at a pace the magical box is genuflecting to

A MONODY ON MARS
================                  By David Hunter Sutherland

Images of Venus, writhing in her sea,
sunlit specimens un-breathing,
while the fisherman baits a picture
whose artist lies nascent in dreams.
(Because there is a lake, a breeze, a setting sun...)

And, so it is for Mars - whose disillusioned self
sits fetid in his waste,
red hands - white sands,
fissure trapped islands of eyes...
in a large sense   searching,
(should even this escape him),
there is a world, his star, our universe superimposing
this ratio superior of
brutal half-truths turned law,
icons seething in his net as
your quantum gesture flips
baited on its' back, 
sun-backed to submission,
answering death.
(should even this elude you),
There is an ocean, and a bigger fish to catch.

PAX MONGOLICA
=============                         By David Hunter Sutherland 

And the Wave, 
porous to touch,
collapsed at your door.
The full dissolution, "OM AH HUM !", and
mantras of desperation, (heartbreak...despair),
spiral down an orbit near
a retrograde star.

Yet on a small scale,
Life coodles and croons to you,
from an atoms' gestation,
to the milk and manna of meal for a sun.
Our toss and turn dream Buddhas' tight subtle bodies are
muons that bind you in this cosmic soup of
strange bedpartners,
heavy velocities,
and ghost orbits.

Now affixed within this gaze, you sleep snug.
Friend to the ethers and comforts' raison d'etre.
Both, borders in a universe,
whose cause and effect portend as
loves' finest vision;
a vision of swords into shares,
sheaves into rain,
rain into your silence...
(as an eerie peace ensues.)

Worlds pregnant in worlds,
and the buzz of matter is not beatific vision or
pleasure, if pleasure is found in that original sin:
the Father of Lies whispers, "Is this paradise?",
as intuition of pure Being looks in opposite directions,
vaguely concerned for transitions, events,
ulterior or exterior motives.

Alien half-knowns, animal faith and eventual passions
privy my thoughts in their private collection,
stationed between Here and Now,
requisite relativities of labouring minds
cling to this pervasive sphere of
sound blue skies and "B" flats, 
illusions of positive depths pure and
simple strike my captive audience
whose view now bent on idealized natures,
