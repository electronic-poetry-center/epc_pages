     The Veery
  
  Grape vines, curled around imaginary central stalks
  That color us, that while defining us reflect
  
  Fine seeds, flax seeds, practice we can see -
  Fall around us, it is good not to be curtailing
  
  Aromatic pull of sight, you tell me to gaze
  And it is perfect here, night is a garden
  
  We lounge in our silk garments, you take me in the
  Describing myself
  
  Your body made of language
  Water.  Rocks formed with rushing over them
  
  Your white breath
  Listens
  
  Geese striking the gray-green 5:30 sky
  It is afternoon - it is night

     Gel
  
  In this direction, a stream of
  Fresh buds on spring trees,
  Detecting strings night stands
  On, so carefully threaded.  To
  Grasp all this, to hold out towards
  Harmony a murmur, north star
  Shining in clear darkness.  A strand
  Fuses, lime on the cool lawn, forms
  That name themselves, our fronds.

  desert recipe
  
  red rock, burned forearms of a boy who never
  met the sun so close to his face, high in the sky
  where the stone is transparent beneath, resting
  like air beneath my heels.  the roads and rivers
  below, twisted into snake tracks, bare skins of god's
  
  past lives, his first stirrings dead in these stones
  laying out in the sun to rot hard and pretified
  
  a fossil of deceased moons, lifeless 
  civilization of sunlight's ruse off road and barb wire
  rusted into thin shadows of birds, making the horizon
  wet and flowing with empty seas of space, sweating
  from my skin, a smell hanging from the rock cliff,
  bringing vultures from the scrub.  their weak break
  in the atlitude muttering "feed off this dead air of the world,
  be a carrion creature, and in your own belly
  learn what small creatures digest here
  
  ...devouring silence."

  These blue powers make a whole - the rib
  String, a potent gaze, a noise - I know
  
  The rain pins us, the sea is our focus,
  Your name rings, exploring me, a bell -
  
  My grasp of the matter is firm at least.
  I feel, full - I want something impossible.

  IN PLAIN SIGHT
  
  I.
  Beginning with last night's blackouts & those lullabies.  I
  thought I had a vision, something to tell you.  Acres out back,
  willow trees & power lines only in this land.  And then the
  blackbirds, hundreds from nowhere, in one gesture bring the
  house down.  The willows side by side, wood snapping in half
  here & there.  Their incessant screeching disturbs the base of
  our necks with delight & fear.  Absent of any corridor they
  wait for the rain.  Tiny claws curled into the bones of the trees.
  Our road outside suddenly taking in nothing.  No one driving
  through for miles.
  
  II.
  
  Vertical the color of the beachfront winds.  Back inside
  lighting one silver columnar candle, boneweary matches
  slipping to the floor; picking them up again, hands shaking.
  Walking out of the kitchen with the candle & placing it on the
  front mantlepiece.  We have the radio on for good now.  It will
  only be time before these power lines snap in half under their
  clutching weight.
  
  III.
  
  Standing back outside, finally, watching them.  All of us in
  plain sight.  Suddenly the landscape seeming to age too fast.
  Taking us back to a childhood photograph.  Somewhere
  between a white road & a white sky the memory returns to its
  beginning.  Pictures & words of this landscape piece together.
  
  IV.
  
  It changes in a word & they lift off, black point meteorites
  into a new translation of the coastal fog.  Left behind under
  one willow is a rock the size of a desert story.  We were awake
  long into the night thinking about those birds.  Was there the
  chance pacing of a mountain lion outside the black screen
  door late last night?  Or did we dream this together?
  Increments of rain falling the next few days over our
  beachfront house.

  helen's skeleton
  
  Troy lifts into heaven
  as pieces of ash & cinder
  
                      a trail of black ships
                      sliding spear point
  
            between the ribs
            of wooden horses
  
  helen lifts herself 
  from the ruins
  
      her beauty, vulture wings
  
  reduced to burnt offerings
  
  language's love
  burning in her mouth

  1-900 SEXTINA
  
  Despite distance, anonymity may contain hot
  conversation recorded through the core
  use of telephones.  As feral is to phone,
  complaints may be directed as samples:
  imagined arbitrary and wild,
  or anonymous and you know what I mean:
  
  teased with the breathy flush of mean
  as meant to allude a furtive glance at hot.
  You don't have to say, just listen for a wild:
  hear feral housewives, swingers at the core.
  Any hole may mean you or me or samples -
  aural swatches fitting fetish to phone.
  
  Buy straight sex, but no vistas by phone;
  nonetheless, you're alone and way the mean.
  It may be the best, you and I for x samples:
  a soundbite, a gist or highlight of hot
  filling some hole, some hollow core
  dialed open, each phoneme triggering wild.
  
  The brotheled body probably bottled, wild
  wriggling awake from sleep to phone,
  out of the cradle endlessly desiring core.
  Says he, About that wild ogre last night:  what's it mean
  to say a lonely housewife's pain throbbing so hot
  round the clothed line of her life, hanging hot samples?
  
  Says she, Grip any phone and I'll yell for samples,
  (that tubercular cough so kinked with wild).
  It's tongue and cheek and get a grip, collar hot
  and why bothered, barking over the phone?
  It's all commodity changing hands to mean
  something hard extracted from the core.
  
  He thinks to unwind, dialing life loose from its core.
  But how make-sense-per-minutiae of life's samples?
  Who cares the content or context?  It makes him mean
  what he says for once:  going out for a wild,
  be right back ... down to the pay-phone
  for more of the naughty tongue's hot.
  
  The paradox of core:  both hard and wild.
  It's only samples we bear on the phone,
  to mean, despite distance, something close, hot.

     The Spar
  
  The aubade of consciousness, a crack
  In drapes, it shows bare trees reflected
  Light cast on them.  Now last night is gone.
  Now in the feeling dark you will forget
  What gulled all this, material thought
  Marking our grounded outlines together.
  It's cool on skin but warm outside, your lace
  Covers sight - morning, barely after night.

  smiles made possible
  by industrial process.
  
  no elbows.
  crotches like tables.
  no dinner.
  
  no problem.
  in their dream home.
  
  nerves painted blue
  perhaps (but probably
  not) inside their hollow
  
  torsos.  no hunger.
  they smile forever.

     The Funnel
  
  I will not give in - model sash
  Consciously reflects that here
  
  Stalk, altogether - alliterative, mark
  Insistence, diction - bowl of picks
  And nut-meat, shells - fluent
  Blank confounding simple taste
  
  Celery on the wet - every word
  To repair as we evoke.  Solve
  
  Rows of white houses in afternoon
  Country of inland respected cap
  Discussion granite conclusion tip
  
  Thus the wild forest reduces
  In full degree - how dark it is -
  Ice becomes pyramid of meaning
  The port - right atop - sprung

  Plantings
  
  Smells like the seashore "my (eye sluff)" wiping's
  palm hanged off the shelf of chin like a chew o'
  'baccy leave "(ink sinks in the) sheen sure back slops"
  same shoes every day, surfy path, clings to's leg
  like's pants' rank drip.  Burying the fish or the
  rope's thick wrist, he's in the manure naked, "groping
  through the fist"  Later, "on the coffin-log sits
  you", biting back sand, where the thirsty rotting ...
  
  Crumbling, fertilization, sticky hand

  Libations To Bridget
  
  Slippery as a broomstick
  the branch which crosses
  over the creek
  taking the spill
  in mountain cold
  
  The false skins
  ditch them next to the tent
  then go in with Patrick
  breasted mountains swallow
  the sun
  
  Stars rise to the top of the sky
  sweet cream
  we pray Brie
  take the blood that still trickles
  from under the fourchette
  possiblity lost under a mound
  
  The butter urn you tipped over
  has been burning five hundred years
  we stand before the sky
  filled and flaming
  
  Earlier we had spotted a dark mass 
  at first I thought
  a lightning charred stump
  he shaped-shifted into bear
  we took slow backsteps
  
  A sequoia grove held us we waited 
  our turn on the narrow passage
  while he pulled off berries
  juice darkened his tongue
  then he vanished
  
  Knowing the scent of lochia
  bloomed on me
  painted self with invocations
  started down the path after Patrick
  pack as heavy as a small child
  
  My sisters used to drive a spike
  into a tree trunk
  to drive out a changeling
  and bring back the baby
  
  The midwife called it a blighted ovum
  went into the garden
  and eventually fed
  the meloned vines of summer
  
  At Kildare where Bridget reigned
  St.Patrick took the corridor
  to the underworld
  and cornish money-wort
  sprang in her footsteps
  
  The color returns
  to the skin of the sky
  we hike off the map and it blows away
  a wolf sneaks from the lake
  mercury gray rippling haunches
  
  Breathless we muscle
  to the top of the pass come
  over a blanket of snow
  tinged with red algae
  growing up from beneath
  
  Cliff face  a waterfall is mostly
  hidden by snow
  though there is an aperture
  where we see through to liquid
  
  Your invisible harlots
  pulled me into the creek
  and through to the karst
 with its cavities
  
    From drainage points we scaled
  up to where earth swells
  and arches to you tensely
  from its bed of rock

  a brief history of fireworks
  
  popping black jacks into the river, watching
  them implode, clearing off dark eddies.  the belly
  of fish ignited.
     his unfinished face crumbling back into darkness
     as the flare sinks, turning cold in the murk.
  
  upturned glass lips screaming off bottle rockets.
  our childhood lapsed years in slow rivertown.  excited purple dusk
  whistling and cracking K-Mart parking lots.
  those July nights the rockets rain trailing
                                 kite strings of unmade bodies.
                        spark babies of gunpowder without hearts or
  craniniums.
                        an autopshy of howling lungs, turning to ash and
  cinder,
                                 bits of small color that linger on your
  eyelids.
  
     the crickets hushed as chinese mummies sleeping
     in clay beds.  places where children make cheap watches.
     our hills and river valleys loud and smokey
     as revolutions in burned hands, or dragons
     snoring.
