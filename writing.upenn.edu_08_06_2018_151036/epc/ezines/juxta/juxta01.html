ARTICULATING FREEDOM
THREE BRIEF NOTES REGARDING THE CONTEMPORARY UNDERGROUND/OTHERSTREAM

1. By designating particular works as experimental we dismiss them as
unproven, hypothetical, of questionable veracity. This is our means of
allaying the unknown's imposition on our intellectual security. It is not
until the work is analyzed, cataloged, and finally judged valid that it sheds
its ignominious, obscured and burdened now by whatever aesthetic code may be
in currency. Yet, what we are too apprehensive to witness directly is the
very thing we profess to seek. We erect a shrine that obstructs the
beneficence of the power toward which the original impulse arose. This is an
ancient condition, mythically tragic. We are method's hostage. What we know
of reality is not in what our terminology proposes to address but only the
terminology, as it is an aspect of nature, itself.

2.A poem is not the telling of a thing, but the thing itself utilizing
language, in whatever form (and however the definition of language might be
extended), to transmigrate from one "place" to another. It trans-forms to
awaken to itself in renewed aspect, and to awaken others to its experience.
The poem and poet call one another to a common ground of being, where they
constitute a single entity. To be more specific, a poet is an individual
poetic entity biologically appearing. It speaks, it bodies forth being,
participates in the theater of objects. What might be the essential nature of
such a pansubstantial creature can only be discovered through direct
 confrontation and mutual dissolution with in the shared domain, the
anitpersonal dynamic this union cultivates. We are speaking then of the
phenomenology of the open field. Yet, we must speak in the negative only
since any absolute assertion would only project an apparition onto the field.
The actual projection is the whole field of poet/poem and all participants,
indistinguishable any longer as individuals (and there is much that surely
remains unknown, latent in the field). And further, the field itself, being
open, is never subject to definition, but is realized  through experience,
through communion in the common nature its very appearance makes evident.

3. Finally, we should not concern ourselves with the establishment of
movements or schools, by the name 'experimental' or any other. There is
nothing noble in relinquishing our presence here to the status of artifact,
shelved, another moment documented and weighed against the rest, even if that
moment is granted fundamental importance. It falls on us to strive for a
cognizance liberated from static ideologies and subservience to the symbol.
The histories must be ended and the museums closed (they both are, as we now
have them, closed anyway). We must find value in the moment's appearing
rather than the misapprehended corpse of its past. With that approach it is
our responsibility to be and allow creations presence that have in their
character no tolerance for the spirit of closure no more than any other
organism can tolerate imprisonment. They are creatures without dimension, the
living courses of liberation through the infinite.

THE WORD TOAST

The one who painted himself insecure to others kept using the word toast as
if to beg the power of a talisman to coat his shack with bullet-proof
transparency.  If victimed by the fact of a transparency.  Many acres since
have been inhaled into his possession.  Headlock mates with slides the
heart's eye makes. He races to unfinish lines before his hypothetical
opponents can consider factual arrivance.  Do they make fun of his cleats,
his hand tooled pistol, vats of acid he owns shares of.  Do they make fun of
eyes that fathom poverty as he has known it and consistently misplaces into
future tense.  Do they see all the way into his bones to know no blue blood
he would feign can swim in that vicinity.  Do they reduce or see him evenly.
The one with life to prove yet wears a petproof winter in which shepherdly
behavior leaks a frothed blue breath above the cars.  Would any shoulder
minus sainthood let his head be there.  He wouldn't question custom.  Only
would continue his embodiment of big screen things no one can tender
very long inside a heart however stretched toward forgiveness.

CONSTRUCTION ZONE

Prom queen glibly as a print embodied muscularity of artist's line not
bandaged from her whole heart.  Through my fault, through my fault, through
my most grievous...shells made fragrant through erosion.  Downtime seemed
maternal.  She line segmented a cough, made plain the diseconomy of
splintering.  Bruised texts, up for renewal for which she was instructed to
remember code word anguish from the hot line.  Untended parks once neutral
places left their hinges.  Watching became the highest form of flattery,
sand grains entering the winded place of children.  Forethought requiring
that one conquer through division the prime number feminine.  Much charted
waters attributed to blank space in the equation.

POSSESSION

Tale of wicked dawn
outside image weapon
makes me accomplish
consent ravenous

Narcotic asserting
furtive and vocal
given to like advantage
enduring the day
the mind the house scatter
dark room speech
covenant no way obscure
paradise hollow dream
in suicide past

Strike bulging maze
said generation now
almost sky fear abandon
one another

Eat matter in public intimate
rage stone not look force
within killing words
broken cutting burning
between your millions hidden
and paid for empty

Written with a shut door
spinning faster body
to inhabit when I'm
out in the cold or stuck
in midway country

Put down drop ever wealth
return years' foothold
foreign music lost on
such deep liquid

Heaven sent ground motive
blazing shell street current
hand in the way of desire
becoming helpless

Rain over miracle sign
needle facing inward light
mountain roots of power
finds me more at the start

SO LONG

Life again set off
by chatter
ring  around it rushing
perverse material
defended like it was a hymn

Press seed charge from
roots that narrow
soft blow begging brightness
weary intimate
voice of age in advance

Together with the only
world I know for certain
death
flower petal eros nature
down the appetite I'm hearing
with my head

I've seen black eye
to carry habit
look nothing break loose
total be granted
more work fall apart
shadow I promoted

Now years after
there is plenty earth moaning
at my embrace hidden in
shades of dramatic
give it a chance

Instincts reawaken
what I didn't think
was action needs quiet
blood trail and damage
of a very rare moment

No silence touches remorse
as larval quality
no tangent temporal feeling
remains in the past
I point toward in my
strung out wish

THE LIFE OF THIS PERIOD

being freely passed from hand to hand
we can only react to it with complete disdain
forget the reciprocal nature of its duties
above all confessions of men obsessed
against any and all professional risks
the simplistic theatrical portrayal of the beyond
[into a diamond, all blind and interior]
these footsteps occur in a region
desire to proceed beyond the insufficient
hold it to be specifically modern
[to hold the cult of men in deep distrust]
unhesitatingly the notion of jumping off the track
all the betrayals lost their footing
[too late for the seed]

burned, if we can believe his words
for derisive laughter rumbling
is not any number of men
constituting a closed circle
for the suppression of everything
and informers run around loose, the time lost in waiting
years, leaves them perplexed, psychic force by a
means which is nothing, an animal from a
flame or stone -- heaven help the most typical and
characteristic, though it were true conviction
I mean of the acceptance or the
nonacceptance of this regime, no way competitive
partly understood, confused, in defiance
our allegiance to the principle
of historical materialism

there is no way to play on these words
noticeable decline in the ideological level
of the most undesirable intellectuals
a progressive loss of awareness, this control
cannot be exercised in political circles
"working" and scheming together,
[a pleasure seeker] in a harum-
scarum sort of way
in less time than it takes
to tell those mysterious friends
forced to confess the talent and force of Trotsky
(your name grows larger week by week)

such divergences, about-faces and betrayals of confidence
wheat from the chaff, the sincere problem of human expression
as though for the pleasure of travelling, dumbfounded at first
admirably and perversely, to annihilate this ridiculous romanticism
anything but the first cry, sovereign and limitless
truly harrowing, finding its end in itself
and aspiring only to serve
just as pointless to protest
no longer any "useless mouths"
shamelessly castigating
hitherto exercised to the full extent of its powers
torpedoing...the idea in the midst of the sentence, he retires
into the happier world no one had ever dared conceive of
lucid, awake, he would be terrified, capable of opening
that how-to-swim, into the water, now forced to say
completely consumed the other beneath the tropical stars
of all human constraints the ridiculous tradition
young after the passage of centuries, this reconciliation
rendered absolutely impossible
the baleful bread to the birds

the sordid quests for every integrity
to run absurdly, learning it
in snatches, submitting oneself anew
to discipline, befouled, senile,
rank, sordid, lewd, doddering

the fact of the matter is that M. Battaille is simply very tired

the light that will cease to fail
brief beauty concealed
dangerous sentiment of living

welcomes the discharge of his sad rifles

Just as Chaos keeps its hidden orders -- assuming that Beauty
is beyond scale -- if, &  only if its iteration is driven to
Fury -- so you have crosst my Tongue with the oldest knife.

Skepticism must ban the sight of Utopia:  a straight line is
the deepest labyrinth.  Natural language has no author.  The
reddening of the landscape coincides with the movements of a
clock.

Fascicle 1
The first line was completely crossed out, the second barely
legible.  The words were enumerative and blood-linked.  Each
possessed a shadow that hovered over us in the shape of a
hand; abode of a star-gripped paralysis repeated in the gestures
of Inhuman objects.

Fascicle 2
The terms were perfect sections of the voice, skewed in
consequence of a dreamt assassination.  The letters, neither
flame-like, nor flower-like in that world without sound, were
aligned within a lacerating machinery.  Denuded, then left to
wander through rooms of interlocking narrative.

Do immeasurable spaces exist inside one point?  Here, you have
painted the walls to purify my eyes, littered the floor with
objects too cold to touch.  Yet I am consoled by your philosophy
of the Infinite Cage.

Angelton -- James Jesus

Nervous spies always crave locked mouths.  Your staff,
your Honetol victims were tested looks.
The uses of your ancient safes to conceal the
identities of spies from loose security
were substantially safe, "beyond peer review",
"worse, no one had the combinations",as

you played favorite W.C. Fields with
roll-top desks filled with deliberate "detritus"
a bodyguard of lies concealing "the
precious Nick Nack marine file", sound long term
precautions to safeguard the exits of spies
who trusted you alone.  You didn't believe

in the technology, weren't going to share
information through terminals blinking secrets
throughout the building.  An "elusive mole" was able
to "blink" computer secrets just as your alleged
"paranoia" foresaw.  (See:  Index, The Cold
Warrior, "Angelton James Jesus -- paranoia of".)

When the great battle was over the gravediggers
came and, while cutting their dead throats, told the
corpses what they had done wrong.  "Angelton did not
believe in the technology."  You and the ancient
"Grandpa" safe mocked on agency parade
will always march in the First Cohort of spies

that accepts seared beaten warriors as normal.
Still you would not disclose, not even to your death
in dishonor, the identity of Nick Nack(s)
held by you in so silent a place the inevitable
traitor could be identified in some distant
year on activation.  You alone correctly

foresaw what would destroy world trust in the
capacity of the covert services
to keep their mouth shut.  The final disaster.
Marlowe and Helen still carry the Eagle on a
Trojan horse with Nick Nack and Ann not far behind.
Did Nick Nack die?  Not while your safes had him.

Where is "Grandpa"?  Clearly your Fermi
Accelerator Laboratory for
the wisdom of ancient treason, always
and forever bringing mirrors to Mother
from the Cockroach Universe of spies,
endlessly recoding into your DNA

computer bases the precise mutation
to mass defined on impact by the elusive
scattered particles of new treason, flipping
the coded bases the norm calls errors
to razor balance mirrored Dirac
universes, CJD fusing Angelton

neurons by infinite mirror coding
into strong forces top vomit quarks mutating
by pulse down the DNA spine of your and Kim's
beloved great spongiform game of Trojan
basics:  if two mouths know the name of a spy
spies die.  Ask the Guardian Editor!

You are entitled to a closing argument.

ROBOTIC-      BIRDSONG          NOCTURNE:      POWER-DOWN

Late last night on microcassette
I felt ribbons flown in the beaks of sparrows
slash the lips of metropolitan aexual steel
mascara
gliding over crucible landscapes
in patient stilettos

Voice activated
through lipstick banners of blood
and current drawn from small reaching hands
you've wired
eyes for crying down incestual cheeks
spilling over with rouge and flour

Shaped like a bright doughy bird
cut from paper dolls
for a cat's eye
sucked through the failure-to-please conjunction

Wind-tunnel
I reel
in the shadows of your knees
in daughter-of-the-nails
fatherhood on hard-drive

Flame-retardant
living in the age of writhing
on-screen strange tender dreaming

Deflects
toothmarks deeper than I thought
gnawing your temples
my palms

Grasp the glandular language
tuning speech amplitudes honed to knives
pulled across two mouths
slurring
puffy
intercourse sectioned to kill
phonics screaming
your voiceprint on my lips
disassembles me
