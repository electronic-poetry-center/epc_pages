	I described it as an unidentified playable object and as &quot;a fast paced interactive storytelling piece that tries to be a meta-platform game based on the stream of consciousness of an egodystonic homosexual hero, but it fails miserably and becomes a piece of non-linear kinetic visual poetry written by a teenager obsessed with post-structuralist French philosophy.&quot;</p>

	Can you describe your creative process for Ergon/Logos? How similar or different was this from your normal process?</p>

	&quot;When I first tried Phyta, a software program developed
	by Abraham Parangi that&rsquo;s somewhere between a game and an exercise in evolution, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised that there are no buttons. In fact, there&rsquo;s really no guidance for what to do at all. The experience is eerie, and thought-provoking, intentionally vexing and almost irritating. And yet it&rsquo;s strangely beautiful and seems to be hinting at something deeper than what&rsquo;s on screen.&quot; -- Anthony Clavelli</p>

	Buttons are uncool. They predate the digital age and will likely continue to help us use elevators into the future, but for now, we don&rsquo;t want them on our electronics. It wasn&rsquo;t always this way. For generations of videogame consoles, the controllers were a breeding ground for buttons. New buttons sprung up anywhere you could reasonably find a finger. But at some point, the way these things go, the button boom declined. Touch-sensitive screens on phones and ATMs, increasingly useful track pads on our laptops, and click wheels on our iPods have made physical buttons almost seem primitive.

	Mobile tagging: nomadic writing for expanded reading</p>
<p>
	Mobile Tagging is a phenomenon directly related to the popularization of mobile telephony and the popularization of QR-Codes. It is a kind of writing practice for the reading to be held in transit, based on a bimedimensional bar code - QR-Code (Quick Response Code). In other words, it is nomadic writing for expanded reading.</p>

	ABSTRACT</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper aims at showing a brief panorama of the poetry that circulates on computer (hard and floppy disks), CD-ROMs, Internet and sites. This poetry can be named experimental poetry, new visual poetry, digital poetry, internet poetry or new media poetry. Certainly, it constitutes a genre itself: the digital poetry genre, which appears side by side with the many other existing poetry genres (verbal poetry, visual poetry, sound poetry, and so on).</p>
