<STRONG>when new time folds up</STRONG>, Kathleen Fraser<BR>
<STRONG>A Reading 8-10</STRONG>, Beverly Dahlen<BR>
Beverly Dahlen's <EM>A Reading 8-1</EM>0 and Kathleen Fraser's <EM>when new time 
folds up</EM>, both from Chax Press, offer exquisite meditations on the simultaneity 
of life and death, memory and experience, memory in experience, and on the interplay 
of culture, history and the poet's subjectivity. Since Chax Press is run by an 
artist-printer-poet, it is not irrelevant to point out that both books are very 
pretty, featuring cover paintings that promise the perception and exuberance that 
the contents deliver. Both draw on multiple intertexts, including Keats's urn 
(Fraser explicitly, in her &quot;Urn Pictures,&quot; which describe fragments of 
sexual tableaux; Dahlen also explicitly but more understatedly, in the fleeting 
phrase &quot;thou still unravished&quot;[31]) and Derrida's writing and differance 
(Dahlen explicitly by repeating the italicized word <EM>&quot;differance;&quot;</EM> 
Fraser implicitly by referring to an always already present even in a prehistorical, 
now &quot;abandoned&quot; setting), to find a relationship between inner psychic 
lang(uage)scapes and outer time/space landscapes.
<P>
Dahlen's book is fun, beautiful, and smart. The cover, Cynthia Miller's &quot;Red 
Chair/Tree of Life,&quot; shows a child's painted and decorated chair with a more 
abstract but equally exuberant, flowering &quot;tree of life&quot; rising from 
behind it. Joyous, childlike artistry combines with natural cycles of production and 
reproduction. (The waitress at the cafe where I read the book stopped to exclaim 
with excitement, &quot;I had a chair just like that when I was a kid!&quot; In a 
sense the book made her day.) The &quot;contents&quot; comprise three longish chunks 
of writing identified by time/place of completion and revision; the book addresses 
and speaks from an explicitly gendered experience of power, frustration, creativity. 
Her meditations include observations like: &quot;she has mistaken it, mistaken the 
call. the brotherhood will not include her. it is madness for her to think so. and 
for him also madness, or pious sentimentality. she has a different story&quot;(60); 
and the provocative apokoinu &quot;guiding his hand, please me, since I am your 
mother, all women are&quot;(8). Throughout, Dahlen invokes fictional, mythical and 
historical women such as George Sand, de Beauvoir, Austen, Eve, Cordelia and Mary 
Shelley, in order to explore the interplay, through language, between socially 
patterned relations and creativity. &quot;What is language?&quot; she asks, and 
answers catechistically, &quot;a pattern, an archaic heritage&quot; (120). 
<P>
This q&amp;a could easily serve as epigraph to Fraser's book. This volume is more 
contemplative and fragmented, though equally beautiful. The cover art work, by 
Mary Hark, offers a photo of an assemblage of blue rectangles, a handmade paper 
painting that suggests the traces and artifacts of ancient cultures-Etruscan, 
Roman, and medieval Italy-along with present-day Europe; the cultures that Fraser 
works with in the four poems that make up the book. Fraser uses a traveler's 
curiosity to receive intuitions about how past and present cohabit consciousness 
and the material world, how sensory traces of memory/culture resonate but remain 
tentative and mysterious: &quot;temple rubble abandon... Grief is simple 
and dark/ /as this bridge or hidden field/ where something did exist 
once/ /and may again, or/ your face receding behind the window...&quot; (32-3). 
Figuring Etruscan as &quot;she,&quot; Roman as &quot;he,&quot; Fraser also genders 
memory and art. She also juxtaposes her own letters to women friends with a poem on 
Giotto's and Dante's artistic correspondences, not for contrast but for resonance 
and mutual illumination. In the final piece, &quot;when new time folds up,&quot; we 
are in the present, in the presence of a muted violence (car accidents overheard 
from indoors, urban construction sounds) that, retrospectively, has also accompanied 
all of the Western civilization she honors. This personalizing of cultural loss 
and/or survival is ethereal, grounded, haunting.

<A NAME="murphy"></A>
<STRONG>Teth</STRONG>, Sheila E. Murphy<BR>
Sheila E. Murphy makes small, versatile containers and reuses them again and again. 
The containers in <EM>Teth</EM> are page-long (or shorter) assemblages of centered, 
unpunctuated phrases that vary in length; they are also holes in the sidewalk, a 
Mormon storage pantry, a sexy Chevy, a humming Frigidaire, a silo, trashcans, 
a &quot;prescient creekbed / pathing trance into a keepsake,&quot; a &quot;telepathic 
art museum,&quot; a small train station whose occupants want to be mentioned, clay 
pots cast on a wheel. The fillings have different strengths of syntactical linkage, 
so that phases of narrative or exhortative talking, brainpuzzling, ambience-tuning, 
and portraiture swerve into one another. Often there is one big swerve (as in 
sonnets) that takes you from pop culture to sacrament, abstract to honkytonk, 
free enterprise to stolen leisure.
<P>
Reading the <EM>Teth</EM> poems is like attending to moments that would otherwise 
pass away unstored-moments of fleeting critical focus, or those between one and 
another exercise in holding sense together. During such intervals nonviolence works 
on its job description in postindustrial capitalism, the journey home from 
self-employment becomes infinitely complex, and Thanksgiving, sexism, and 
the &quot;insulated enemy&quot; get their due. As for poetics, 
Murphy's &quot;out-to- lunch&quot; sign hangs unconcealed; as the canon 
reverberates, she ties her craft to the previously anonymous and sequestered. But 
the poems do not aspire to shut you out. A book may be a lapdog, &quot;genuine 
pronounceable and free to vary,&quot; or salvaged pieces of screen to be shared with 
a &quot;wide awake new audience.&quot;

<A NAME="ott"></A>
<STRONG>Wheel</STRONG>, Gil Ott. (Gil Sans type and linoleum block prints pressed 
into Frankfurt, Mohawk, and papers handmade by Thomas Leech, Sonia Telesco and 
Charles Alexander.) 
<BR>
Gil Ott's <EM>Wheel</EM> is a meditation on the circle of life, the cycles of lives 
and the ambiguities of existence. Eight of the ten sections of this serial work 
consist of succinct lyric poems paired with equally terse prose passages which 
contrast with or comment on the preceding poem. Typical of Ott's work, the line 
between statement and question is constantly drawn and erased as the sequence 
prospects the nature and notions of the actual and the illusory. The text is 
accompanied by four quasi-representational linoleum block prints by the author.
<P>
Like all Chax fine print editions, <EM>Wheel</EM> is beautifully designed and 
lovingly printed. Its varied textures creates a tactile reading environment in 
which to experience Ott's work. This is particularly relevant because <EM>Wheel</EM> 
is, at another level, an investigation of the book, both in Jabes' metaphorical 
sense and in terms of the actual book this sequence is coming to be (has become):
<BLOCKQUOTE>

I'm interrogated<BR>
taut by repetition of a cry:<BR>
gull plowing wind<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Smart folio, as if a knot could lead to an agreement. Answer in the words of the 
interrogator, the same words, your words. Appearance has nothing to do with it.
<P>
In printer's jargon, a folio is a sheet folded in half resulting in four pages. The 
above passage appears on the right hand page of the center folio of this book where 
the hand-sewn binding is knotted. This kind of understated, supple interaction 
between the text and the actualization of this book is its principal charm. 
<EM>Wheel</EM> is an intriguing exploration of the dimensionality of the book.

<STRONG>Individuals</STRONG>, Lyn Hejinian &amp; Kit Robinson<BR>
<P>
Some individuals—publisher (Charles Alexander), designers (Alexander, 
Jennifer Beigel, Lisa Cooper), writers (Lyn Hejinian, Kit Robinson)-have produced 
an indivisible book. I nd I v I duals. Duals over entitlement to what title I has 
meant for individuals are absent. I &amp; I vs. I? duals, 
residual &amp; verbal: I &amp; I find favour. Indivisible I, divisible 
delight. &quot;[A]ccess to letters opens the possible / clasped tight 
in change&quot; (KR). 'Social change': surplus in pocket after day's transactions, 
subtractions. <EM>Individuals</EM> mint for it. &quot;Written individually&quot; 
sealed by initials & date then mailed back & forth there are twenty-four poems now 
twelve lines long with accretional effects of intratextuality 
dispersing<A NAME="one"><SUP><A HREF="signals1.html#1">1</A></SUP></A>. Shared first person 
pronoun, second rarely used (address never excludes reader)-with the regularized 
verse form may suggest one serially reiterated I. Except linguistic uniformity is 
contested at every poem's abrupt close by the facts of dual authorship, time-based 
construction, &amp; book design. Neither is I stabilized within disjunctive effects 
as a &quot;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror&quot;: &quot;My portrait is a bowl and 
I tap it with a spoon&quot; (LH). Word values for a world spinning like 
a &quot;neutral band&quot; around a curiously vertigo-free I, as in Ashbery's 
poem, are inverted: any number of I's concavely refract a world stabilized as 
language-objects. When &quot;language&quot; 
replaces &quot;imagination,&quot;<A NAME="two"><SUP><A HREF="signals1.html#2">2</A></SUP></A> 
individuals have defaced the ontological oligarchy. The book has an accordion-like 
spine &amp; slatted page. Pasted on each inside fold are two postcard-sized cream 
papers. Each bearing one letterpress poem, the cream papers are separated by a black 
paper strip, I on its side, <EM>libidinalized</EM> band as threat projected by the 
indivisible skin of individualism these poems separate from &amp; reseam. A split I 
fractally replicated at various material levels of production-book, context of 
composition, language—Individuals is a crypto-leftist reworking of political 
address for the craft aesthetic inside the commodity form.

<A NAME="silliman"></A>
<STRONG>Demo to Ink</STRONG>, Ron Silliman<BR>
With the publication of <EM>Demo to Ink</EM> (1992), Ron Silliman's ongoing project 
for an American longpoem adds six more sections (<EM>Demo, Engines</EM> [with Rae 
Armantrout], <EM>Force, Garfield, Hidden, Ink</EM>) to the previously completed 
seven (<EM>ABC</EM> 1983, <EM>Paradise</EM> 1985, <EM>Lit</EM> 1985, <EM>What</EM> 
1988, <EM>Manifest</EM> 1990) and brings him to the halfway mark of a project he 
originally thought would take only five years to complete. These new sections 
continue the main features that have marked almost all of Silliman's work since 
<EM>Ketjak</EM> (1974; published in 1978). Each work is generated by a different 
formula, method, or set of generating/governing procedures that is conspicuously 
arbitrary and non-&quot;organic,&quot; reminding us that the alphabet itself imposes 
a completely arbitrary order on an arbitrary set of phonetic signifiers. Each new 
section features what Silliman has called the &quot;new sentence,&quot; his 
alternative to the &quot;line&quot; as the micro-unit of composition in free 
verse. The emphasis foregrounds parataxis, and resembles structurally and 
functionally the ways in which the &quot;shot&quot; is the fundamental unit in 
the cinematic system. In the cinema, the framing of an image selects a block of 
data from the flux of the world, the selection itself constituting an assertion of 
significance. Montage, the art of assembling individual shots into a dynamic system, 
demands instantaneous transitions that have no analogue with the objects of 
the &quot;real world,&quot; but are comparable to the mental shifts that mark human 
consciousness. Silliman's mastery of the poetic montage allows him to range from the 
brooding, elegiac mise-en-scene of <EM>Ink</EM> to the breathless pace 
of <EM>Force</EM>, calling to mind William Gibson's self-descriptive lines 
in <EM>Neuromancer</EM>: &quot;Night City was like a deranged experiment in social 
Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the 
fast-forward button.&quot; Or Silliman's sentence 
from <EM>Ketjak</EM> : &quot;Burma Shave parataxis.&quot; 
<P>
With a very few notable exceptions, these works are relentlessly urban in theme and 
focus, suggesting the image of a proletarian flaneur, notebook in hand, prowling 
through the streets of San Francisco and environs on public transportation 
(&quot;I ride the bus.&quot; <EM>Ink</EM>, 143), ready to catch any new 
sentences that present themselves to eye or ear: 
<P>
Woman in the seat next to me (we're barrelling downtown) inhales the mucous in her 
sinuses, loud deep gravelly sound. Front page of the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> 
has drawings and graphs, not photos, a 6 column page and seldom a headline more than 
one column wide (ah, but their verbs, the implicit metaphors of business as war, 
circus, game, are pure bunk) [Ink, 148]. 
<P>
As those who have studied John Cage's aleatory procedures will appreciate, the 
seeming effortlessness of the results can be deceptively simple, masking the intense 
artistic discipline and discrimination of eye and ear necessary for their production. 
Lyn Hejinian puts the emphasis on composition, implicitly reminding us of the 
literal meaning of that word: &quot;What presses as a question upon writing 
now ... Is how to <EM>arrange</EM> words, or word groups, rather than how to choose 
them. How to lay them there, or, rather, string them....&quot; Silliman's 
favorite model for his poetic practice is the urban artisan Simon Rodia, maker of 
the Watts Towers, who illustrates &quot;the right way to think about the 
construction of art in its relation to life. You find the materials about you and 
just keep adding them on as it feels necessary. Your sense of the work will guide 
you.&quot; Silliman rivals Stein and Ponge with the persistent rigor of his 
attention to the literary text as an event of writing, and his tendency to absorb 
the unfolding work into the &quot;present&quot; discourse of the writer in 
the process of writing-what Michel Foucault calls &quot;discourse bound up with 
the act of writing, contemporary with its unfolding and enclosed within 
it,&quot; that has replaced the &quot;voice&quot; trope as sign of 
authenticity. (Stein: &quot;This is a sentence if it is an event.&quot; 
<EM>How to Write</EM>.) And perhaps only Stein can make it look easier than 
Silliman; or an outfielder casually shagging a fly as if he didn't really have 
anything better to do at that moment. In such acts the better it's done the easier 
it looks.
<P>
In a recent parody Gary Sullivan presents himself as a fan of Silliman who is 
disappointed that the author &quot;hasn't risked much in the `development' 
department&quot; and that <EM>The Alphabet</EM> is &quot;little but ... 
a one-trick pony.&quot; He claims that &quot;we Silliman fans could 
probably write the remaining sections of <EM>The Alphabet</EM> in our 
sleep,&quot; and proposes that we should do so in order to allow 
Silliman &quot;freedom to begin to explore new territory.&quot; The problem 
here is probably that Sullivan is <EM>reading</EM> Silliman in his sleep, or 
pretending to as an occasion of wit. The amazing thing about <EM>Demo to Ink</EM>, 
and <EM>The Alphabet</EM> as a work-in-progress, is the way Silliman continues to 
explore the same lines of practice and development without being reduced to writing 
generic Ron Silliman. Each section in this collection is utterly different from the 
others in almost every respect: form, procedure, tone and affect. Affect? Yes, 
affect; or (in fact) E=M=O=T=I=O=N (&quot;This is about my 
emotions.&quot; <EM>Ink</EM> 162). The biggest surprise for me in this collection 
was the pronounced move into the elegiac mode in Ink. Prior to this only 
<EM>Garfield</EM> had hinted, very slightly, at the potential in Silliman and his 
procedures for fulfilling that oldest of poetic functions: words 
spoken (written) over corpses. I would urge anyone who shares Sullivan's view to 
give <EM>Ink</EM> the careful readings it deserves. It is a good example of the 
cumulative functional importance of context in the ongoing production of &quot;new 
sentences,&quot; and how emphatically such sentences are contextual objects. The 
mise-en-scene for <EM>Ink</EM>, this &quot;Ballad of the body reduced 
to ash&quot; (166), is so far unique among the books of <EM>The Alphabet</EM> for 
its fog-bound saturation in dreams and memories, a world of age, sickness, death 
and decay, of infancy and birth, children and parents. Longer sentences appear, with 
actual syntax, parallelling the webs of familial and social relationships (mother, 
father, grandmother, son, uncle, friend). The people who appear are not merely 
glimpsed through the windows of a moving bus; they have names (Krishna, Darrell, 
Asa, Val....) and suggestions of identities and pasts. 
<P>
This is not to say that Silliman is becoming a &quot;confessional&quot; poet, or 
renouncing his often-repeated belief that &quot;That which is merely personal should 
soon appear in <EM>APR</EM>&quot; (<EM>Garfield</EM>, 37). His foray into the more 
personal realm is marked by continued attention to the textual nature of the 
enterprise:
<P>
I don't write these texts so much as shed them, shells left behind that should you 
find them years alter should prove no less opaque to you than to me: who was that 
masked man? But I remember (often, not always) having written these words-what I 
recall are my emotions, where I sat, what the weather or light were like, what else 
was active, charged in my life at that moment-not to be confused with understanding 
the text (<EM>Ink</EM> 148). 
<P>
As a longtime reader of Wittgenstein, Silliman knows that we can understand words 
that seem to signify inner experiences (thoughts, feelings, sensations) only if they 
belong to a public language, so that understanding of a 
person's &quot;individual&quot; or &quot;private&quot; or &quot;personal&quot; 
experience cannot be separated from our understanding of the larger world of 
experience. His Lone-Ranger allusion (&quot;who was that masked man?&quot;) reminds 
us that our word &quot;person&quot; comes from the Latin <EM>persona</EM>, meaning 
an actor's mask. The personal in Silliman, even when it may seem rhetorically 
conventional, continues to be rooted in a profoundly social conception of the human 
condition and in the awareness that it is shaped by and in language. And language, 
in its written form, is the endless recombination of the same old same old 
twenty-six signifiers, Joyce's &quot;Alphybettyformed verbage.&quot;

The poems of <EM>Outlantish</EM> are readily available in Mackey's recent City 
Lights collection <EM>School of Udhra</EM>, but the astonishingly sumptuous 
presentation they receive in this deluxe limited edition volume puts them in a whole 
new light. It's hard not to dwell on the purely physical pleasures of this beautiful 
volume: the handsewn signatures, the immaculate two-color letterpress printing, the 
handmade paper, and the enigmatic and thoroughly appropriate drawings and collages 
by Sonia Telesco. Unlike many such packages, however, the elegance of the 
presentation in no way overshadows the poetry. Mackey more and more confirms himself 
as one of the most consistently fascinating poets of our moment.<P>

</table>
<EM>Quirks &amp; Quillets</EM> is a book that you HOLD and that holds you. In what terms might I describe what this book is <EM>physically</EM>? I am greatly impressed by how it responds to one's hands, which I think is partly because Chax Press has designed here a horizontal rectangle rather than a vertical one (a small &quot;plot of land&quot; or grid of activity for its words), the way its text &quot;crops&quot; its own verbal activity-
<BLOCKQUOTE>
grids are common in some way crops shape the elsewhere occupied needles health derives its singular strand fluid clear circle through (30)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
-to the weight of the pages. The pages stay open, hold open in your hands (the way 
children's books can have the same shape, insistence, the pages weighty and W I D E 
enough for the eye to roam with comfort-that is, the page says: read me here or dally 
with me or do you see this is also a visual &quot;feeling&quot;).
<P>
Each page is itself a self-constituting typographic work. A generous point size makes 
words physical, engages, corralled into a justified &quot;plot&quot; at the center of 
each page. White   space   gathers the words  into a physical fete in the center of 
the frame. (&quot;Not rhythm yet repetition she said so it was/ written to be 
recorded but if heard then/ listened to attentively without false moves.&quot;)
<P>
The words are <EM>slippage</EM> within this frame. Where they might point is 
slipping (&amp;quot;minus cement lessen/ the load,&amp;quot; i.e., lesson). The 
lesson of their texture is that it bleeds (slips) into the pattern of their 
fabric. (&amp;quot;In this small way the body translates to taste or/ smell compared 
for lack of equilibrium...&amp;quot;) Or, the words are the weights that hold the 
semantic &amp;quot;pages&amp;quot; open, as the parsing itself has weight as solid as 
atomic weight (and plays):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Assigned <EM>blue</EM> water is clear conception's more than that could show fox 
prints early in the h's night swift owl or surly bands signal the impression wind 
before window whatever that means to the letter... (35) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>THE PLAY</FONT>. Show becomes snow to both a fox and an owl (h issue). Water is a linchpin with blue and clear similar weights, radiating outward to assigned and conception's equal weights. The &quot;h&quot; in night as the ahhh or quirk or night activity. The wind before window is both the wind outside the window but the word itself. (And where are the willows?) The four letters of &quot;wind&quot; wind up attached to &quot;ow&quot; and though both wind and window are transparent, one is something that you look through while the other might blow through you. (My ear still hears the &quot;ow&quot; from &quot;owl.&quot; That's MY &quot;h,&quot; still howling...) Of course the point is that this is PRECISELY what is meant-indeed &quot;to the letter.&quot;
<P>
So then what is a quillet? (Is this word less frequent in U.S. English?) We can 
presume to have a sense for &quot;quirk&quot; (an oddity). However, present day usage 
denies much of what is buried there in &quot;quirk&quot; since it is not only 
a &quot;sudden twist, turn, or curve,&quot; a flourish-<EM>with particular reference 
to writing and drawing</EM>-but also a &quot;verbal trick, subtlety, shift or 
evasion&quot; as in &quot;quillet&quot;-so that the title itself is 
circular, &quot;a plaster likeness admiration comatose.&quot; Quirk, in this sense is 
not quirk alone but is chased by quillet. A &quot;quillet&quot; is a small plot or
narrow strip of land or a verbal nicety or subtle distinction, a quirk, quibble. 
Otherwise it is a small quill or tube (Mac Cormack has a previous book titled 
<EM>Quill Driver</EM>. I would note here the phrase in Yonge's P's &amp; 
Q's: &quot;Rolling up her papers into little quillets.&quot;) Or, as a verb, to 
quillet is to quibble.

<BLOCKQUOTE Linking and entangling causes<BR>
with insoluble quirkes and quilits...</BLOCKQUOTE>

These words written in 1609 were only waiting for <EM>Quirks &amp; Quillets</EM>. So 
that the sense is physical, something is actually moving, not just flourishes, but 
quibbling over each letter-the composition TURNS on these. As indeed the original 
sense of quirk WAS physical-as these quirks here (echoed in the physicality of this 
edition) are physical-not figural.

<STRONG>Mizu</STRONG>, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge<BR>
Wisps of grey-blue fibers float as if on watery currents on the smooth white cover 
of <EM>Mizu</EM>, a handmade book of the long poem of that name by Mei-Mei 
Berssenbrugge. &quot;If the boy goes under the water,&quot; the poem begins, and then 
unfolds (both in the narrative sense and in the physical shape of the book itself) 
as an extended, exquisite meditation on an afterlife in the sea. <EM>Mizu</EM> 
evokes the passage of time, as well as a coincident sense of both awareness and 
forgetting. Berssenbrugge's lush and vivid details make the story at once tragic and
reassuring. 
<P>
Text and context work well together here as the soft, spacious pages support both 
the tender exploration of the tale and a thin blue ribbon of watercolor that flows 
across the top of every page. The wide, horizontal format makes a good home for the 
poem's extended lines and its long, slow sense of breath. Originally written to 
accompany a piece of choreography and also based on a Japanese fairy tale, this 
steady, mindful text dances well on its own in this long river of continuously 
glued pages that can open out to a full length of nearly 14 feet.
