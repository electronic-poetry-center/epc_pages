<STRONG>World Well Broken</STRONG>, Joseph Donahue<BR>

Few poets raise the stakes as high as Joseph Donahue boldly did in his first two 
volumes, <EM>Before Creation</EM> and<EM> Monitions of the Approach</EM>. In those 
books Donahue practiced a volatile chemistry, siphoning diverse influences-Eliot's 
mythic architecture, John Berryman's jagged wail, and Michael Palmer's cool, 
elliptical dreamscapes-to give us some idea what contemporary poets might do with 
the long century which dogs tirelessly at our heels.  Into this already heady brew 
Donahue then dropped a generous dose of potent pop-culture icons like Lee Harvey 
Oswald and Lenny Bruce. So combustible a mix still yielded an assuredly elegant 
result: an impassioned, oracular verse capable of drawing imagiste blood as readily 
as it sketched intricate tabloid palaces.  With his latest book, <EM>World Well 
Broken</EM>, Donahue furthers and deepens this alchemical project.
<P>
In this short space, it's best to focus on &quot;Christ Enters Manhattan,&quot; the 
long poem whose seven sections comprise nearly half the book. At its core is a 
phantasmal city where fire, ash and &quot;obliterating light&quot; (p.35) sift 
through the air and we come to see &quot;the powers of the sky are unlocking.&quot; 
(p.36) as &quot;Cosmologies gust, die out&quot; (p.44). It is a hell badly in need of 
harrowing but the Messiah promised in the title never arrives. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This Inferno predicates no Paradise:<BR>
Only radiance, welling here as shadow.<BR>
Only darkness, within light. Only, flung through space,<BR>
this wave of stones the color of an exploded 		cathedral... (p.54)</BLOCKQUOTE>
In place of redemption, Donahue offers the lush, sensual spectacle of annihilation: &quot;Seawind/ routes the funeral heat./ Ritual's end: the shovel turns over&quot; (p.39). Rendered, as it is, with pointillist and unerring lyric grace, this threnody intoxicates us by repeatedly reenacting the final hour, each time more ingeniously than before, thus leaving us some small Beckettian cheer in simply being able to &quot;go on.&quot; But a deeper joy follows from Donahue's lush theatricality-derived, in part  from Book of Revelations&quot;Throne a barrel of unburied bones&quot; (p.46) as well as Times Square-&quot;Fist Fucking, Black on Black.&quot; (p.42) Done on an epic scale, this high-voltage myth making conjures an inescapable millenarian testament for the faithless. We read it as one reads a death sentence in which every word cries out life.

<STRONG>A Further Succinct Life: William Bronk's Books on Talisman House Press </STRONG><BR>
William Bronk states, at the conclusion of his poem &quot;Your Way 
Too,&quot; that &quot;Things are far / more complicated than we say 
they are&quot; (<EM>Manifest; and Furthermore</EM>, 7). To read the poetry of Bronk 
is to enter into his rigorous investigation of the complexities of the world as well 
as his examination of the very tools by which the world is measured-language and 
conceptual forms. And even though Bronk recognizes the inherent limitations of 
language, his world and, consequently, bringing the world into the light. Bronk's 
poetry, that is to say, documents his interrogation into being in the fullest 
possible sense. For example, consider &quot;Left Alone,&quot; from <EM>The 
Mild Day</EM> (1993):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Left alone as it seems we often are,<BR>
we can determine parts of our lives and the lives of some around us. More than that, 
we say what the world may be, how it came about and why. We give our truth. How 
great we are. 
<P>
Something that doesn't mean to contravene us, something that needn't even know we 
are there, in going about its own procedures, sweeps it all away: whatever we did 
or said.
<P>
Sweeps us away. We are beside the point. 
No matter. Close beside. The seriousness of desire is a voice that sings us up and, 
in its singing, humbles whatever claims. (8) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

&quot;Left Alone&quot; accentuates the mind ruminating upon its own processes as it 
moves the reader into the complexities of language, epistemology, poetry, and 
thinking itself. Yet, after negating the possibility for a human &quot;truth,&quot; 
the poem, nonetheless, annunciates a sense of peace that arrives through the poem's 
singing. For Bronk, the poem is the vehicle by which the limits of language are 
transcended, although the transcendence itself remains outside of language or any 
other &quot;form.&quot; In this regard, what is unique and valuable about William 
Bronk's poetry is that it documents a mind rigorously engaged in the act of being in 
the world, and through Bronk's meticulous attention and precision, his 
poems &quot;sing us up&quot; into clarity and lucidity. 
<P>
The books of Bronk's on Talisman House-<EM>Manifest; and Furthermore</EM> (1987), <EM>The Mild Day</EM> (1993), and <EM>Our Selves</EM> (1994)-are the extension of fifty years of writing poetry and thinking about the world. Consequently, much is to be gleaned from Bronk's poetry: much is to be listened to and carefully weighed and measured. As Charles Olson said upon reading Bronk's poetry, &quot;I may have, for the first time in my life, imagined a further succinct life.&quot; Bronk's poetry sings its readers into a pure, resplendent (and inhuman) light: &quot;Equal&quot;: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This silence, this light where<BR>
nothing is heard, nothing seen is that<BR>
same silence, that light where once<BR>
splendors were heard, splendors were seen once not needed<BR> 
now in the silence, the light. (Our Selves 73)

<A NAME="notley"></A>
<STRONG>Selected Poems of Alice Notley</STRONG><BR>
A <EM>Selected Poems</EM> recapitulates. Not Alice Notley's: instead, she gives us a 
narrative, a Poet's Progress. There's a gradual climb through early work (where she 
was creating her own forms of collage, lyric, and confession) to a turning point 
where she forsakes them for an epic. And from there on in a beautiful hell breaks 
loose. Sadly, &quot;White Phosphorus&quot; and &quot;The Descent of Alette,&quot; the 
visionary poems, are only excerpted. Still, you can see her scope in smaller 
masterpieces like &quot;Jack Would Speak Through the Imperfect Medium of Alice,&quot; 
&quot;Waltzing Matilda,&quot; &quot;At Night the States,&quot; and the finale, the 
great &quot;Red Zinnias,&quot; a meditation on the thinghood of humans and the 
humaness of things. Instrument, most exquisite MRI in existence, of &quot;Not 
existing/In order to see it&quot; the six-and-a-half-page poem funnels down to such 
a close as tripped a hundred automatic reflexes in this reader: &quot;The zinnias 
are gone I burst with crimson/Stand up and do something human/What is human Hardly 
anything Say something red.&quot;

<STRONG>Postmodern Poetry: The Talisman Interviews</STRONG> 
[with Ed Foster] &amp; <BR>
<STRONG>Primary Trouble: An Anthology of Contemporary 
American Poetry</STRONG> [Eds. Leonard Schwartz, Joseph Donahue, and Edward Foster] 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness.&quot;
<BR>-Whitehead
</BLOCKQUOTE>
During her discourse with Ed Foster, Susan Howe pauses to consider the bibliographic 
work of George Butterick, whose Olson scholarship is &quot;one of the most generous 
gifts to poetry in [our] time.&quot; In the distribution of poetry haloes, it is 
equally impossible to pass over Ed Foster, whose press and journal <EM>Talisman</EM> 
continue to set a new table for poetry readers and writers in a difficult cultural 
climate. Foster brings a note of seriousness to these conversations not seen since 
the heyday of the <EM>Paris Review</EM>, when nervous interviewers would obviously 
prepare for weeks, indeed with their whole lives, before paying the visit to Williams 
or Kerouac.
<P>
But &quot;EF,&quot; interlocutor, never seems nervous. The life of the book, the 
spectrum of interests refracted in this series of interviews-with Bronk, Coolidge, 
Hollo, Howe, Mackey, Notley, Padgett, Scalapino, Sobin, Waldrop, and Yau-is a 
function of Foster's magnanimity as a reader, and of his prophetic sensibility. His 
range of reference is so ample that for the most part he remains an inconspicuous 
presence in these interviews, prompting the unfolding of positions so intricately 
and eloquently wrought (Howe, Mackey, Sobin, Yau) that it is, at times, difficult 
to conceive of the text as completely spontaneous. The reader with any doubts can 
turn to the opening page of the Padgett interview and observe the two talkers back 
into Padgett's Tulsa origins. The ensuing pages, in all their humor and pleasure, 
are priceless for anyne who wants to understand how the generations of the New York 
School might be (self-) conceived, and what the family ties were to the older 
cousins in France. Foster's ability to put himself in the place of the interviewee, 
literally and figuratively, generates fascinating &quot;finds,&quot; like the Greek 
coins sweated up by rain in the soil near Sobin's Provencal &quot;cabanon,&quot; or 
the &quot;shiny and knobby and colored&quot; objects which Notley remembers hanging 
in her parents' auto supply shop in her hometown in Needles. His only quirk as an 
interviewer is his propensity to ask (nearly) everyone about Spicer.

Which is not to say there aren't some instances of subliminal friction. Notley 
discusses her poem &quot;Hurricane Belle,&quot; explaining her sense that the storm 
is a &quot;valid psychic shape&quot; for a poem; when Foster steers into a question 
of the variable foot, she replies, &quot;we need something that's more than a foot 
or a line. It needs to be something that's more nebulous than that.&quot; Querying 
Howe about the &quot;actuality&quot; of history, her appreciation 
of &quot;silence&quot; is marked, in reply, by the real silence of women in 
history: &quot;if you are a woman, archives hold perpetual ironies.&quot; Also 
fascinating is the exchange on aesthetics and politics which leads John Yau to claim 
that &quot;formalism is the aesthetics of the assimilated.&quot; Foster locates all 
of these poets &quot;outside the poetic mainstream as defined in standard classroom 
anthologies and histories of American poetry&quot;; what unites them is &quot;a 
trust in radical form, however achieved,&quot; and a resultant poem 
which &quot;rises from its own necessities&quot; and (only 
secondarily) &quot;implies a truly radical politics.&quot; As Mackey searchingly 
puts it, &quot;It is quite obviously and manifestly true that poetry and poetics has 
done and does do political work, but the political work that it does is often a 
consequence of more immediately political work not being doable.&quot; What Mackey's 
troubling formulation manifests is the doubt which Foster expresses in the opening 
piece of his collection <EM>All Acts Are Simply Acts</EM>: &quot;Poetry Has Nothing 
To Do With Politics.&quot; 
<P>
If this were true, then Leonard Schwartz's introductory positioning of the anthology 
Primary Trouble would not be so... troubling. The book, which opens fortuitously 
with Will Alexander's &quot;Ball Lightning,&quot; is a wild and engrossing 
supplement to other recent anthologies of postmodern poetry (Messerli, Hoover et 
al.). It includes work of poets who &quot;were born after 1933&quot; and who emerged 
in the 70's, 80's and 90's; this leaves more room for adventurous and risky 
inclusions, though (like <EM>Talisman</EM>) the collection is best represented by its 
selection of poets in mid-career. Plenty of the poets in the &quot;New Coast&quot; 
<EM>O-blek</EM>, for instance, also seem to belong on the &quot;map of poetry 
drawn&quot; by the editors of this collection. Of course, extending the map would 
mean extending the book, which, at approximately 450 pages, is already stately 
plump. At minimum it would have been interesting to hear, in the introduction, some 
names of poets the editors regretted having to exclude. Inevitably, the decision to 
make visible certain affinities between a strain of New York School writing and a 
writing loosely associated but not coincident with &quot;the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E 
project&quot; necessitates exclusions, but what does Schwartz mean when he refers 
to &quot;that school's agenda for poetic hegemony&quot;? Is it naive to be troubled 
by the ironic recurrence of poetry politics in this utopic context? 
<P>
The gift of this anthology consists in the poems and proses, alphabetically arranged 
by author, from Alexander through Lauterbach to Yau. All 
open &quot;postmodernism&quot; to (in Schwartz's words) &quot;prereflective panics, 
angers, and ecstacies, to fresh beginnings which might momentarily hold off the 
critical apparatus.&quot; It is difficult for &quot;the critical apparatus&quot; 
to describe this ark-load of beauties. I was surprised by a Bunting/Jones legacy of 
'inscription' in many of these works. The Beats (and their inchoate sex politics) 
are also a ghost presence; many of the poems reach for articulations of the mythic, 
the sexual and the spiritual in an anarchic and relatively unfamiliar verbal 
currency. I notice that language is more often suppled toward sensual rhetorical 
abstraction than plied for the plasticity of sound as sense, or place as ground. 
This book wants to nudge the boat of North American poetry off some dehydrated turf 
and out into the baptismal blue. When a &quot;terrible beauty&quot; sparks 
a &quot;terrible insomnia,&quot; as the work has in my case, the anthologists' task 
has effectively been accomplished.

<A NAME="jonas"></A>
<STRONG>Selected Poems</STRONG>, Stephen Jonas (Ed. Joseph Torra)<BR>
Until recently the letters and notebooks of Stephen Jonas (?-1970) have lain in a 
basement in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Age/origin unknown, indeterminately 
&amp;quot;black&amp;quot; though his death certificate 
reads &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;, sometime mental patient and jailbird, Jonas was 
mostly known in the streets of Boston and the pages of such magazines as 
<EM>Origin</EM>, <EM>Measure</EM>, and <EM>Set</EM>. This <EM>Selected</EM> brings 
together his small, studied, Greek-Anthology-like <EM>Exercises for Ear</EM>, and 
the sprawling Cantos-modeled <EM>Orgasms</EM>, as well as a number of intermediary 
poems such as the swinging &quot;Cante Jondo for Soul Brother Jack Spicer, His 
Beloved California &amp; Andalusia of Lorca.&quot; Jonas swallowed Pound whole, 
including bigotries, which his occasional madness enlarged upon. But that is only 
one face of a poet who took the range of attitudes-satirical, lyrical, erotic, 
prophetic-and made it personal theater. Joseph Torra in his introduction reminds 
us &quot;In his poems Jonas sacrificed anything to get the music right.&quot; I 
reckon that's a vice by today's standards, so if a little sweet sin is what you're 
looking for, the guilty will relish Jonas.

<A NAME="mina"></A>
<STRONG>Real: The Letters of Mina Harker and Sam D'Allesandro</STRONG>, Dodie Bellamy and Sam D'Allesandro<BR>
Reading Sam and Dodie's book reminds me that what Milton took from Virgil troping 
the death at sea of Edward King and codifying in English literature as purely 
artificial the Pastoral an appropriation of the Rural as old as the hills and 
Imperial Empires-Roman or American-&quot;slip the garlic from your cunt and think of 
mother England&quot; (p. 77), that what had to be left alone, left out, was sexuality 
and why?-it was already there in Edmund Spenser in <EM>The Faerie Queene</EM> but 
Milton would have to forget his own translation of the of the Satyr from 
Virgil's<EM> Eclogues</EM> (Comus) under the ideological pressures of writing a poem 
attacking Church and State and readying the ground for imagining Regicide. So this 
problem has been around a long time-sex and politics, repression and 
revolution-through a less ancient instance would be the excoriation of Tina Modotti 
in the communist press following the discovery of Edward Weston's nudes of her and 
her own nudes in turn of the young and handsome Cuban revolutionary assassinated at 
her side in Mexico City in 1929.
<P>
I read D'Allesandro and Bellamy's <EM>Real</EM> as an important one among a 
generation of writings where there begins to be brought 
into literature the replete, expansive dimensionalities of the social and 
sexualized Body, &quot;a punk sculpture, perhaps the picture tube has been gutted 
and the empty space filled with an anti-nativity <EM>holocaust faces white as 
ice</EM>&quot; (p. 105), and I'm thinking here how Real turns this return into a 
dialogue and correspondence that documents and mourns an emotion &quot;-but that's 
not the point, is it-the point is to look, not in horror not in pity or even in 
compassion, but to look as precisely as possible at the ever-wavering presence right 
in front of one-&quot; (p. 115), insisting on what's there at the same time that 
it's going and already gone.
<P>
In the transcript made from Sam's voice, &quot;Travels with My Mother,&quot; the 
Blue Ox that abrupts in the associative immersion of the body talking against time 
is both the mythical dream-animal from the other world and surviving sign of a rural 
origin (see Sam's passage on his arrival at his mother's place, p. 63, his memory of 
herding cows and sheep down a dirt road) that marks this story as one among an 
increasing series of migration narratives. Dodie Bellamy has had text with Sam 
D'Allesandro and made with him a book opening to send a language for the experience 
of a community-real or imagined, is there a difference?-physically predicated on the 
free-play and insatiability of what it still means to be human, fucking 
humans, &quot;dead center <EM>the Real in every reflection</EM> . . . &quot; (p. 93).

<A NAME="spicer"></A>
<STRONG>The Tower of Babel</STRONG>, Jack Spicer<BR>
Jack Spicer began and abandoned his &quot;detective novel,&quot; which editors 
Kevin Killian and Lew Ellingham have titled <EM>The Tower of Babel</EM>, in 1958. 
Even in its fragmentary state-the murder about which one assumes the plot would come 
to revolve only occurs in its last four pages-this is a fascinating and assured 
document.  Spicer, like Eliot, Pound, and Auden, was an assiduous reader of detective 
novels (though his tastes ran to far more hard-boiled fare than the fastidious Eliot 
would have cared for), and <EM>The Tower of Babel</EM> shows that he had studied 
Hammett and Chandler to good effect.  It's no surprise that Spicer writes a lucid and 
graceful prose, nor that the author of <EM>After Lorca</EM> has an almost 
preternatural grasp of dialogue.  What is surprising is how straightforward and 
readable this novel is, with none of the stylistic tics that make so much mystery 
literature-from Chandler on-alternately amusing and irritating.
<P>
<EM>The Tower of Babel</EM>  is also a literary satire, doing for the avant-garde 
poetry scene of fifties San Francisco what Kingsley Amis or David Lodge do for the 
academy. The poet John Ralston has returned west from Boston-where he has become, 
much to his dismay, an establishment poet-to check out the much-vaunted &quot;San 
Francisco Renaissance,&quot; and there are parodies here of the Beat scene, the 
late fifties intersection of poetry and jazz, and the Black Mountain phenomenon. 
Regrettably, the book doesn't do much to cast light on Spicer's own incomparable 
poetics, though there is a strong implicit contrast made between his 
own &quot;practice of outside&quot; and Ralston's joyous production of a poem that 
is &quot;one of his poems.&quot;

<A NAME="lansing"></A>	
<STRONG>Heavenly Tree Soluble Forest</STRONG>, Gerrit Lansing<P>
Gerrit Lansing belongs to that much-maligned group &quot;the 
Olson cult,&quot; &quot;the last all-male group in the U.S. gathered around a 
particular poet&quot; (Marjorie Perloff). They are, perhaps, the most impressive 
array of unread writers this century. Taking John Clarke's Institute of Further 
Studies as their measure, I count the following among their members: John Clarke, 
Albert Glover, David Tirrell, Robert Duncan, Michael McClure, Michael Bylebyl, 
Anselm Hollo, John Wieners, Robin Blaser, Joanne Kyger, Ed Sanders, Alice Notley, 
Robert Grenier, George Butterick, James Koller, Duncan McNaughton, Daniel Zimmerman, 
Edgar Billowitz, and George Butterick.
<P>
Lansing's contribution to the Institute's ongoing Curriculum of the Soul was 
<EM>Analytic Psychology</EM>, now the final section of <EM>Heavenly Tree Soluble 
Forest</EM>. There we are told, &quot;the Poem / comes in its own cocklight, / time 
the solitary flowering bird sings up the rising god&quot;! 
<P>
I place Lansing's work in the context of this extravagantly disparaged cult only 
to explain how a poet so gorgeous and original could escape serious notice these 
past thirty years. A unique mix of Aleister Crowley and Walt Whitman, Lansing's 
poetic relation to Olson is akin to that between O'Hara and Auden-important, early, 
and largely irrelevant so far as casual reading is concerned. Indeed, the only 
writer Lansing <EM>really</EM> reminds me of is that genius of science fiction and 
fantasy, Theodore Sturgeon. Here's Lansing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gone from Iowa the wild turkey, quail,<BR>
but still the dentist operates, the boy's sex stiffens, a Winnebago holds the tooth in his dripping hand. It is a pearl he gives him.<BR>
Under the pillow and it is gone<BR>
Could Olson have written that stanza? I think not. <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Lansing's is a poetry of images, of slow but haunting music, of words that charm 
where another's would insist. His work produces an intensity of feeling much as a 
beautiful house gives occasion for a party, for a gathering of two, four, ten or a 
hundred friends.
