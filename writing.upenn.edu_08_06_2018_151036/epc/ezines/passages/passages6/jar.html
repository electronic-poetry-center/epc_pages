<P><B>It would be difficult for me to talk about my identity as a writer
without</B>
<BR><B>acknowledging first my identity as a reader.&nbsp; What I learned
to do early</B>
<BR><B>in life, as a survival mechanism of sorts, was to invent a self,
or a composite</B>
<BR><B>of selves, as if my own life was formed out of a distant memory
of who all</B>
<BR><B>the other versions of me had been throughout the history of my kind.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>distinctly remember those early moments in which my creative identity</B>
<BR><B>emerged-- driving to the Angola Public Library on Saturday afternoons
with</B>
<BR><B>my parents, where, upon arriving, my father would quietly leaf through
the new</B>
<BR><B>issue of National Geographic in search of photos of naked women,
while I retreated</B>
<BR><B>to that narrow shelf in the children's section, labelled "biographies."
It was a place</B>
<BR><B>I would return to over and over again during those years, and a
place from which</B>
<BR><B>eventually I would accrue the knowledge of the lives of an incongruous
assortment</B>
<BR><B>of baseball players, politicians, inventors and scientists, mostly
white and mostly</B>
<BR><B>male, with the rare exception of a Frederick Douglass or a Betsy
Ross.&nbsp; Having</B>
<BR><B>decided at some early age that no one in my family or among my friends
would</B>
<BR><B>serve as an appropriate role model, I removed myself to the realm
of books to</B>
<BR><B>find out not only who I was to be, but perhaps more importantly,
where I fit in.</B>

<P><B>The quest began for me at the age of ten, when I found a book titled
simply</B>
<BR><B>"Abe Lincoln."&nbsp; I remember few particulars of that day, though
I assume</B>
<BR><B>that it was a typical Buffalo winter, and that I confused it in
my</B>
<BR><B>imagination with the winter of 1816 during which Lincoln's father
made his</B>
<BR><B>way across the Ohio River during a blizzard that killed 2000 pioneers.&nbsp;
For</B>
<BR><B>some time after reading that text, I went through a series of identity</B>
<BR><B>transformations, which began with my insistence that my mother buy
me a</B>
<BR><B>coonskin cap, which she never did, even when I spied one at the
Erie County</B>
<BR><B>Fair the next summer.&nbsp; Not to be stifled in my search for the
frontier, I</B>
<BR><B>settled instead for a flannel shirt and a pair of cowboy boots,
and began</B>
<BR><B>to spend many an afternoon crossing the corn field behind my childhood</B>
<BR><B>home, imagining that I, like Lincoln, did live in Indiana and that
some day</B>
<BR><B>I would leave my humble life there to become a storekeeper, postmaster,</B>
<BR><B>surveyor, state assemblyperson, lawyer, and eventually the president
of the</B>
<BR><B>United States.</B>

<P><B>There was seldom a moment in my otherwise ill-adjusted childhood
during</B>
<BR><B>which I didn't think I was someone else.&nbsp; By the age of 15,
it still seemed</B>
<BR><B>to me that no one would ever understand me as much as Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>had conversations with him in my head; I tried to read books about</B>
<BR><B>surveying; and I composed polite speeches which I hoped someday
to deliver</B>
<BR><B>to my family before I left for the real world.&nbsp; And then something</B>
<BR><B>happened.&nbsp; One day, while wandering aimlessly in the Kmart
department store</B>
<BR><B>on Route 5, I discovered an album by the Rolling Stones-- a record
which</B>
<BR><B>had arrived in my town at least a decade late.&nbsp; It may have
been as much a</B>
<BR><B>shock to me as it was to my parents when I stopped thinking of myself
as</B>
<BR><B>Abraham Lincoln and decided that I was Keith Richards.&nbsp; I gave
up the</B>
<BR><B>flannel and started wearing ripped tee-shirts.&nbsp; I collected
cigarette butts</B>
<BR><B>out of my father's ashtrays and began posing in front of the mirror
with</B>
<BR><B>them dangling out of the corner of my mouth, and finally, after
my parents</B>
<BR><B>got tired of me running around the house playing air guitar with
a bent</B>
<BR><B>tennis racket, they bought me a used acoustic guitar at a garage
sale.</B>
<BR><B>From that point on I would never be the same.&nbsp; Suddenly the
idea of being</B>
<BR><B>the president seemed frivolous to me.&nbsp; I was going to be a
rock and roll</B>
<BR><B>star. For a little over two years I persevered mostly unsuccessfully
to</B>
<BR><B>master the fine art of the rock guitar riff, all along putting up
with my</B>
<BR><B>younger brother's relentless heckling.&nbsp; And at the very moment
that I was</B>
<BR><B>ready to acknowledge defeat, I discovered a new entity to model
myself</B>
<BR><B>after-- a person who was in my mind, the genetic cross-breed of
Abraham</B>
<BR><B>Lincoln and Keith Richards.&nbsp; His name was Bob Dylan, and his
three chord</B>
<BR><B>folk style guitar songs were those that any novice musician could
at least</B>
<BR><B>imitate badly.&nbsp; I quickly retrieved my flannel shirts from
the recesses of</B>
<BR><B>my closet, and again, spent afternoons crossing the corn field behind
the</B>
<BR><B>house imagining that I was in Minnesota, and that some day I would
rise up</B>
<BR><B>from my humble beginnings to play my guitar in a cafe in a place
called the</B>
<BR><B>West Village, and that possibly someday I would even meet a poet
named</B>
<BR><B>Allen Ginsberg.&nbsp; I spent months reading every available biography
of Dylan,</B>
<BR><B>and, as a teenager, I even learned how to make use of those more</B>
<BR><B>sophisticated research tools-- the bound periodicals, the microfiche</B>
<BR><B>machines, the photocopier, and the VCR.&nbsp; I began to compile
an archive from</B>
<BR><B>with I could easily lift personality traits, noting any vague similarity</B>
<BR><B>between Dylan's childhood and mine, taking account of each theory
of his</B>
<BR><B>psychological imbalances, following the important events in his
life, and</B>
<BR><B>of course, committing to memory the chronology of events that had
led to</B>
<BR><B>his fame.&nbsp; It was around this time that I began wearing a harmonica
holder</B>
<BR><B>around my neck, even to the grocery store, and it was around this
time that</B>
<BR><B>I began to write poems.</B>

<P><B>While there have been many occasions during my life when I have been
asked</B>
<BR><B>to account for, explain, and even apologize for the various phases
of my</B>
<BR><B>sometimes&nbsp; delusional, sometimes politically incorrect, and
sometimes</B>
<BR><B>vulgar identity metamorphoses, I have always believed that it has
been just</B>
<BR><B>such unruly behavior patterns that saved me from an otherwise dull
life and</B>
<BR><B>possibly an untimely demise in the semi-rural, semi-suburban hell
of my</B>
<BR><B>childhood.&nbsp; There are few aspects of my identity not formed
out of that</B>
<BR><B>escape.&nbsp; What I learned from those early heroes was what I
had intuited</B>
<BR><B>from childhood, that one's identity existed as one's invention,
and that as</B>
<BR><B>a creative person, one's identification and explanation of the self
might</B>
<BR><B>always be in flux, like the whole of the universe is in flux, existing
as a</B>
<BR><B>place of multiple possibilities, dependent only upon one's attentions
to</B>
<BR><B>the messages arriving from the outside.</B></UL>
