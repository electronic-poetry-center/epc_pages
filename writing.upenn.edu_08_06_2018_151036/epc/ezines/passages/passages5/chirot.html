&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larry Eigner’s writing presents an acute attention
to and with
<BR>movement. It is a notation of events and things in passing—and in that
<BR>passing, opening out—
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;the music
<BR>&nbsp;in air

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bows,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
trumpets
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moved

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the red sunset
<BR>&nbsp;out
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the window

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ("the music/in air", Another Time in Fragments)</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An indication of this is in the movement of
the lines on the page—Eigner’s poems may begin at the left hand margin—but
they are only there momentarily. With each succeeding line—the movement
is varyingly across the space of the page—the vertical movement presenting
a sequence in time—and the horizontal, a movement in space.
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the slight wind

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfect stillness

<UL>&nbsp;Don’t like to begin with a big B, as if I was at the beginning
of
<BR>&nbsp;all speech, or anything; which may also have something to do
<BR>&nbsp;with why usually I’ve had an aversion more or less to going
<BR>&nbsp;back to the left margin after beginning a poem . . .
<BR>&nbsp;("Method from Happenstance," areas lights heights 6).</UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This “unmooring” as it were—brings into conjunction
the
<BR>attention to particulars—made present in the written marks of letters
<BR>and punctuation—and the occurrence of the spontaneous—what Eigner
<BR>lovingly called "Serendipity".&nbsp; The poem does not begin with nor
become
<BR>an act of attention—but is the movement of the act of attention among
<BR>particulars as a sudden awareness of a triangulation among marks and
<BR>spaces on the page and their relation with things and events in time
and
<BR>space.
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp; . . . a matter of getting the distances between words, and usage
<BR>&nbsp;of marks to conform as well as might be to what there was
<BR>&nbsp;to say, as spoken, then these typographical devices
<BR>&nbsp;entering themselves into the discovery and the initiation of
<BR>&nbsp;attention&nbsp; (areas lights heights 8).</UL>
&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the relationships among the vertical and
horizontal, the temporal and spatial—Eigner’s writing presents a profound
awareness of, attention to and insight into the movement of American poetry&nbsp;
from Pound and Williams through Olson.&nbsp; Eigner makes use of the vertical
and temporal structuring of sequences in Pound and Williams’ work and of
the horizontal and spatial movements of Olson’s.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eigner’s writing marks a significant shift
within&nbsp; these
<BR>movements in his use of the spoken word.&nbsp; Like Pound, Williams
and Olson, Eigner is attentive to writing as a notation of speech.&nbsp;
However, instead of converting the notation of speech into overtly emphasized
musical or visual form, Eigner presents an attention to the particles of
notation:&nbsp; letters, punctuation, spaces.&nbsp; Speech, via an attention
to its notation, is pared down— not by a Poundian sculptural chiseling,
but by a minimalisation of rhetorical devices. "I’m cautious, and come
into things by understatement. Wary of exaggeration.&nbsp; Sotto voce has
resulted in the suppression of words"&nbsp; (areas lights heights 8).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (An interesting and useful study could be
made noting Eigner’s sense of "the suppression of words" and Lorine Niedecker’s
"condensary" method, the Black Mountain and Objectivist understandings
of
<BR>understatement and cutting of words.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a letter, Cid Corman notes the crucial
influence of Robert Creeley on the development of Eigner’s work.&nbsp;
In "Arrowhead of Meaning" Eigner notes this from Creeley’s review of Olson’s
Y &amp; X:&nbsp;&nbsp; “The line is the means to focus, . . . says 'how'
we are to weight the various things we are told”&nbsp; (areas lights heights
47).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eigner’s "suppression of words", the attention
to the placement of individual words, spaces, letters and marks showing
the influence of Creeley,&nbsp; are in turn found in Eigner’s influence
on the work of Robert Grenier.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attention is impacted in notation:&nbsp; what
Eigner called "immediacy and force". The energy is transferred not so much
to the reader, as in Olson’s model—but to the Serendipity of the conjunction
of notation and that which it presents.&nbsp; Attentiveness to the particles
of notation—their placements and markings—simultaneously presents an attentiveness
to the placement of things as ongoing events in time and space. "In writing
you can have more thoughtful spontaneity or serendipity than in talk, a
more accurate realization of things? . . .&nbsp; Accuracy of the moment,
whenever one comes, is the greatest you can have"&nbsp; (a l h 50).&nbsp;
Understatement in writing,&nbsp; rather than fixing "the world and its
streets, places" within the poem—opens:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P a s s i n g&nbsp; R o a d

<P>&nbsp;flash across
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the neon sign

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright day now
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bird&nbsp;&nbsp; in the tree</UL>


<P>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While combining elements of Pound, Williams
and Olson’s work, Eigner does not make use of their juxtapositions, their
collage techniques—perhaps the most significant method made use of by all
three writers.&nbsp; Eigner makes use of spaces instead of masses and lines.&nbsp;
"For the sake of immediacy and force, I got to be elliptical"&nbsp; (areas
lights heights 15).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Pound, Williams and Olson, the space
of the page is used increasingly as an all-over visual arrangement of signs—what
poet and :that: editor Stephen Dignazio calls a "signic event"—from among
whose elements there will emerge a picture writing:&nbsp; for Pound, the
Ideogram, for Williams a Modernist painting, for Olson a hieroglyph. The
juxtapositions function the way a classical Eisensteinian montage does
in a film:&nbsp; they move towards an accumulative synthesis of elements,
a
<BR>dramatic effect.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Eigner’s work—the fragments do not fit
into a an over all pattern—they move outward—indicating neither an origin
nor an ending. Another Time in Fragments—perhaps in some way, given Eigner’s
altruistic bent—presenting an analogy with Walter Benjamin’s Utopian "chips
of Messianic time".
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fragmentation, while not attempting "A
Special View of History" (Olson) nor a reexamining and rearranging of it
as with Pound and Williams, does bear witness to the events of history.&nbsp;
Eigner was a
<BR>continual reader of histories and a close follower, via radio and television,
of world events.&nbsp; In the particulars of these events, he indicates
an ongoing wave rather than an overall pattern.&nbsp; Among the
<BR>historical concerns in Eigner’s work are the ongoing presence of hunger,
over population, global warming, environmental destruction and civil war,
both abroad (in the former Yugoslavia) and in the USA.
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;The Confederacy,&nbsp; you&nbsp; have&nbsp; to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; real

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (opening lines of&nbsp; a poem from air/ the trees)
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In "Whitman’s Cry at Starvation in a Land of Plenty",
Eigner emphasizes the continuum of his interrelated concerns by opening
with his own lines and following these with a stark paring down of a well
known passage in the Civil War sections of&nbsp; Whitman’s Specimen Days:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;Whitman’s cry at starvation

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Larry Eigner Remembered 45).</UL>
&nbsp;The paring down of Whitman’s lines—following on Eigner’s mathematical/verbal
permutative chant ("six&nbsp; ways/of&nbsp; saying it") *1* —indicating
both increasing population—and its wasteful consumption *2*—a starving
down of historical poetic prose oratory as "another time in fragments"
. . .&nbsp; and the fragments bearing witness perhaps to a conjunction
of the Utopian elements in Pound, Williams and Olson and to Benjamin’s
"chips of messianic time" . . .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eigner’s titles continually bear witness to
movement:&nbsp; an analogy
<BR>may be made with the movement of light—which is both particle and wave.&nbsp;
In Eigner’s book titles there’s the particular—and the ongoing movement:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;Air, the Trees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The World and its Streets, Places

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Things Stirring Together
<BR>or Far Away</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s another movement as well in Eigner—one
across space through the time of his living:&nbsp; the movement in the
late 1970’s from the East Coast to the West.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The work written on the West Coast, where
Eigner lived with and participated in a community of other writers close
to hand, as well as carrying on a steady correspondence with others faraway,
is more engaged with a sense of particular people —noted in essays and
the dedications of poems—and social events.&nbsp; A documentation of this
may be noted in the work as well as in Larry Eigner Letters, written to
the French poets Joseph Guglielmi and Claude Royet-Journoud.&nbsp; With
time, there’s sure to be a more comprehensive account and analysis of the
move and its effects than possible here.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, this is a continual movement
among Easts—from the Eastern seaboard towns of Massachusetts, with their
heritage of Eastern goods and culture brought in by ships of the China
and whaling trades—to the Western seaboard, the San Francisco area and
its tradition of mercantile and cultural exchange with the East.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While living on both coasts, Eigner did many
versions of Japanese poems:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Windows/Walls/Yard/Ways 55)</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something "of the East" may be noted in Eigner’s
presentation of particulars.&nbsp; Rather than naming a specific tree or
bird or hill—as might be demanded by both the English Romantic and Emersonian
<BR>traditions—Eigner’s trees, birds, hills are, as in Chinese Shih poetry
and the Japanese poems Eigner worked with,— general:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;the wind masses such birds
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; green inside the tree

<P>&nbsp;("Heat", A Line That May Be Cut)
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poet Robert Grenier—who met Eigner while teaching
in Franconia, New Hampshire and lived with Eigner for many years in the
Bay area and typed and edited three collections of Eigner’s poetry—notes
the New England/Eastern "connection" in his introduction to Windows/Walls/Yard/Ways:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;It is difficult to suppress the inclination&nbsp; to remark that
there is something improvisatorially ‘Eastern’ about these verses,&nbsp;
which may have to do with that coast of Massachusetts’ long- standing 'interest'
in the Far East (e.g. Hawthorne’s post at the&nbsp; Custom House, the Peabody
Museum in Salem, "Bowditch," etc.). (8)</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In and with this sense of place—Eigner may
be thought of as a New England writer along with Hawthorne and Dickinson,
Creeley, Olson and Corman.&nbsp; (With Olson among the poets&nbsp; being
for the most part the one marked exception to the use of New England reticence
in writing.&nbsp; It’s worth noting as well that Pound’s Eastern "connection",
Fenollosa—was a New Englander and that Cid Corman has been in Japan for
over thirty years.).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In "Rambling (In) Life&nbsp; another&nbsp;
fragment&nbsp; another&nbsp; piece" Eigner notes:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp; . . . and came back home to Swampscott on the north shore of&nbsp;
Massachusetts Bay.&nbsp; It has borders with Marblehead and Salem,&nbsp;
where my mother’s parents lived (first I knew directly opposite&nbsp; the
House of the Seven gables a little ways back from the sea wall&nbsp; overlooking
the beach at the end of Turner Street, then a couple of&nbsp; blocks inland
on the same street in a building with a corner store&nbsp; just at the
intersection) . . .</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere Eigner points out his mother’s appreciation
for the New England respect for learning:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;My mother came with an immigrant family to Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They lived very close to the landing from which the clipper ships&nbsp;
sailed.&nbsp; She was the star pupil according to her account, which I&nbsp;
believe, in Salem High School.&nbsp; And she completely absorbed the&nbsp;
Puritan ethic and the work ethic and the high valuation of literary&nbsp;
culture.&nbsp; My mother, and my father, too, really connected with&nbsp;
literary culture (Larry Eigner Remembered 57).</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Describing Salem, Hawthorne wrote in his American
Notebooks:&nbsp; "...its long and lazy street, lounging wearisomely through
the whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows Hill and New Guinea at
one end, and a view of the almshouse at the other..."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In "A View" Eigner opens with this:&nbsp;
"At one end of the bridge is a state prison, at the other the naval hospital.&nbsp;
A mile or so away, there for one to think about, on a hill, is an Old Soldier’s
home."
<BR>(Country/Harbor/Quiet/Act/Around 7)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Sustaining Air (Eigner’s first book,
published by Robert
<BR>and Ann Creeley’s Divers Press) has this poem, presenting "Parts of
Salem":
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
down to the fold
<BR>&nbsp;I saw the upper halves of cars
<BR>&nbsp;moving around my corner,&nbsp; . . .
<BR>&nbsp;last among the marble sites
<BR>&nbsp;and the brick exchanges
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rises of earth
<BR>&nbsp;filled and massed with human stone
<BR>&nbsp;parking space alleviates
<BR>&nbsp;ancient commons which were lonely
<BR>&nbsp;and magnificent prairies breaking the heart . . .

<P>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Girls and mothers of one hour
<BR>&nbsp;in passing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in tender hair
<BR>&nbsp;and men counting silently</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poem seems closer to Williams than Eigner’s
later work—the details are more prosaically connected and descriptive than
metonymic—though there is the acute attention to and with
<BR>movement—and, in movement—the sense of fragmentation—the particles
in ongoing wave . . .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In interviews and statements Eigner frequently
noted his mother’s emphasis on clarity—and his own on "immediacy and force".&nbsp;
"Writing first and foremost was to be understood, had to be clear, while
then I figured immediacy and force take priority, too bad you can’t be
both or all three too often, not long before I read Olson’s “Projective
Verse” essay in the 1950 mag Poetry New York." (areas lights heights 135,
Larry Eigner Remembered 27).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last poem in Eigner’s first book, "From
the Sustaining Air", indicating a tension between clarity and "incompetence",
"understood" speech and writing:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;from the sustaining air

<P>&nbsp;fresh air

<P>&nbsp;There is the clarity of a shore
<BR>&nbsp;And shadow,&nbsp;&nbsp; mostly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brilliance

<P>&nbsp;summer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the billows of August

<P>&nbsp;When, wandering, I look from page

<P>&nbsp;I&nbsp; say&nbsp; nothing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when&nbsp; asked

<P>&nbsp;I am, finally, an incompetent, after all</UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Eigner, clarity is a movement away from detail
to generalizations, planning, a priori theories.&nbsp; There’s no room
for the present, for the detail, the fragment, that presents the serendipity
of
<BR>the "accuracy of the moment".&nbsp; "If it’s big and/or complicated
enough, you don’t get enough of the detail so you can appreciate the present"
(Larry Eigner Remembered 33).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An apparent "incompetence" gives onto a shifting
of the frames of attention:

<P>&nbsp; . . . most things were always tantalizingly beyond reach sight
<BR>&nbsp;and hearing, out of reach, I’ve had quite an impression of
<BR>&nbsp;this anyway, and often enough of barely managing to reach/grasp
<BR>&nbsp;things when I have . . . in order to relax at all I had to keep
my
<BR>&nbsp;attention away from myself, had to seek a home, coziness in the
<BR>&nbsp;world . . . (areas lights heights 26).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shifting of frames as a movement of the
attention among details, fragments, "makes actual the gift of the possible"
in Robert Grenier’s words—opens to "the accuracy of the moment", serendipity.
<BR>Clarity and work ethic for a moment aside, to the background ("and
now I think of a return to amateurism"—a l h 26):
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;If you’re willing enough to stop anywhere, anytime, hindsight
<BR>&nbsp;says, a poem can be like walking down a street and noticing
<BR>&nbsp;things, extending itself without obscurity or too much effort
. . .
<BR>&nbsp;Rbt Frost, saying a poem takes its own course, remarked how&nbsp;
"Step by step the wonder of unexpected supply keeps growing . . .
<BR>&nbsp;While the future is inescapable, near or far in the background
or
<BR>&nbsp;over the horizon, maybe the most a poem can be is a realization
of
<BR>&nbsp;things come to or that come together."&nbsp; At moments (a l
h 26).</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jazz musician Don Cherry often noted that
only a superbly disciplined musician could play Free Jazz.&nbsp; A serendipity
of Eigner’s work is that, beginning with an "incompetence" and insatiable
curiosity
<BR>applied to the New England work ethic instilled in him by his mother—the
writing makes use of what it is given;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Incompetence" is worked
with and makes the "accuracy of the moment".&nbsp; A "Method from Happenstance"
. . .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eigner’s sense of discipline in relation to
extension, serendipity is present in a comment contrasting the work of
Emily Dickinson and Gerard Manley Hopkins:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>&nbsp;As to her use of dashes, varying length (not apparent from the&nbsp;
books)—and there are her ways with capitals too—could Dickinson&nbsp; have
possibly been more careless or less?&nbsp; How regular was her&nbsp; handwriting?&nbsp;
Was Gerard Manley Hopkins a contemporary of&nbsp; hers, before the advent
of the typewriter, or anyway the&nbsp; realization and use of its potential,
who’s known to have come up&nbsp; with a calligraphic system graphing more
specifically, accurately,&nbsp; how to speak a piece (in the mind)?&nbsp;
(areas lights heights 55).</UL>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (It’d be interesting to know what Eigner, sharing
Williams, Olson’s and Creeley’s interest in the use of the typewriter—would
make of Grenier’s “scrawl poems”, his recent four color handwritten rhymms

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disciplined ellipses and fragments of
Eigner’s "barely managing to reach/grasp things" make for a playful thinking
"of a return to amateurism".&nbsp; The reached and grasped for, the work

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larry Eigner’s work—inimitable—is exemplary—a
presentation of conjunctions among discipline and serendipity, words and
things as events extending, opening in a stretch&nbsp; and Williams’ "No
ideas but in things" and "Only the imagination is real".

NOTES

<P>&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Eigner was much interested in numbers, from baseball
statistics to calculus.&nbsp; See for example "Some Figuring Work" in&nbsp;
areas lights heights 18-22 and the collection A Count of Some&nbsp; Things
published by Crag Hill’s Score Publications (1015 NW&nbsp; Clifford Street&nbsp;
Pullman, WA.&nbsp; 99163).&nbsp; In a letter Crag Hill notes&nbsp; conversations
with Eigner frequently turning to mathematics.

<P>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Eigner’s concern with waste was both on the global and
the daily, at-home scale.&nbsp; Robert Grenier in conversation notes Eigner’s&nbsp;
need to make sure all the lights were turned off in the house at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in a letter to Claude Royet-Journoud dated "Samedi le deuxieme&nbsp;
septembre 1978", Eigner writes:&nbsp; "Well,&nbsp; a party going on here&nbsp;
constantly enough,; and the wastefulness and programs to little&nbsp; purpose
also, is a depressing thing, ah! Like a couple of people here&nbsp; are
convinced that the more you turn the tv off the faster the picture&nbsp;
tube wears out, so they leave it on for an hour or more while they go&nbsp;
eat supper in the kitchen".&nbsp;&nbsp; (Larry Eigner Letters&nbsp; 19).
