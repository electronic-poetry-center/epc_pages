I can't collect my thoughts any further, dwelling on the
meanings of Larry Eigner's life, except to remember the time spent with
him in conversation, or say the time Bob Grenier, Brian McInerney and I
took him to the Museum of Natural History on his one trip to New York.&nbsp;
As we came into the room with some of the largest dinosaurs, Larry pointed
straight ahead and said "that's interesting".&nbsp; He wasn't pointing
to a dinosaur skeleton, though, but to an old sign posted on the back wall;
it was interesting, in a style long banished (in exhibition halls now replaced).&nbsp;
I think of that remark of Larry's as displaying how much he lived out his
version of a democracy of particulars, as against the craving for highlights,
for the heightened, that is as much a literacy aesthetic as a consumer
imperative.&nbsp; For Eigner, this didn't mean a flattening of affect;
on the contrary it meant a luminosity of every detail: the perceptual vividness
that his work so uncannily concatenates.&nbsp; This acknowledgement of
the daily, a series of remarks on the otherwise unremarkable, a sort of
poetic alchemy that is not dissimilar to one strain of Jewish mysticism
(a strain in which the mysticism dissolves into an active apprehension
of the real), is an abiding model of and for a poetry where things as they
are let to stand for themselves.

<P>This poet of the ordinary lived an extraordinary life, as if the physical
challenges he faced since birth were spun by poetic license into mental
acrobatics.&nbsp; Larry Eigner is hero of our times.&nbsp; His will to
think was unsuppressible.&nbsp; It was no ordinary privilege to have known
him.&nbsp; I can't think of anyone I admired more.

<P><B>AGAIN EIGNER</B>

<P>There is no writing I know as vivid as Larry Eigner's.&nbsp; He's invented,
for poetry, something equivalent to three-dimensional photography: his
works present a series of perceptions etched deep into the mind, where
the mind is charted on a page and the page becomes a model of the thinking
field.&nbsp; Perception and thought (words and things) are completely intertwined
in Eigner's work, which brings to a visionary crescendo the exploration
of the ordinary — the transient flickerings of the everyday that otherwise
pass more unnoticed than regarded, more dismissed than revered.&nbsp; In
Eigner's poems, one "fragment" is rivetted to the next, so that one becomes,
in reading this work, likewise riveted by the uncanny democracy of details,
where attention is focussed unhesitatingly on each particular with equal
weight, equal exhilaration.&nbsp; This is a poetics of "noticing things,"
where, as Eigner writes, "nothing is too dull" with "material (things,
words) more and more dense around you."&nbsp; But equally, Eigner's is
a poetics of coincidence, where "serendipity" (contingency) takes its rightful
place as animating spirit, displacing the anthropocentric sentimentality
of much of the verse of our time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Anything on Its Side</I> is placed, like

<P>a volume in a tank of water, with utter

<P>gravity against the next moment that occurs

<P>in what is called time but for Eigner is always

<P>spaced, for example on a page.&nbsp; What

<P>would it be to be grounded, to know

<P>the ground under you by the weight

<P>it pushes back with?&nbsp; "Every atom of me

<P>&nbsp;. . . across distances."&nbsp; No awful trembling

<P>unto undecidability, everything founded in

<P>its site, cleaves to what there is, to

<P>what is there.&nbsp; "<I>To be</I> is involved

<P>such words that hold / times in the mind":
<BR>a way, still, that a poem can enact its

<P>own presence, with full measure of the

<P>necessary determination to move from

<P>anything to that which juts against it,

<P>a conviction that life is made of (of)

<P>just such leaps, the contingency of an eye

<P>(aye, I) 'gainst a field of "r/oars" ("<I>suddenly</I>

<P>a day").&nbsp; Something like deep

<P>focus, as if the poems had become

<P>an organ, the sky bellows.&nbsp; Step by

<P>step, slowly turning.&nbsp; Yet there is no

<P>opening onto image here, no mime of

<P>a rehearsal of a scene. Eigner's depth-of-

<P>field <I>charges</I> each page to <I>hold</I> its own,

<P>"to have things whole".&nbsp; "to see / dark

<P>the / invisible".&nbsp; Perception all right,

<P>but not sun-drenched barns: "fishmongers",

<P>"pigment", "air".&nbsp; If there's

<P>narrative, it's narrative unhinged

<P>of causal nexus, logical spools.&nbsp; Each

<P>line rivets its moment &amp; moves on, like

<P>angels on the head of a quill pin, nor
<BR>looks ahead nor back, but "bangs" indissoluble

<P>at precise splice ("each fief") that

<P>bodies the moment from one to next.&nbsp; "to

<P>negotiate the ocean drop by drop

<P>if there were time".&nbsp; In adjacency

<P>is act-uality: "you thought it was

<P>as it is".&nbsp; Nuggets of sound carving

<P>space.&nbsp; "Motion" "motor" "process"

<P>geometry of ties that blind in music,

<P>"the great sea orchestrated with men"--

<P>"what's unseen" "what sound for our

<P>ears").&nbsp; What is "<I>displaced</I>" at each

<P>juncture is the plenitude of eyes seeing

<P>beyond sight, the replenishment of

<P>occlusion's hold, storehouse of an

<P>interior horizon s(t)olid as emplacement.

<P>"What you / see you / settle / on"--

<P>settlement, homestead in the moment's

<P>whole, "such words that hold" nor need

<P>an other embrace.&nbsp; "your eyes open" "we

<P>see something to say or / listen to".

<P>Imagine the extent.
