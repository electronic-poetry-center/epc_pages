FOR THE POETRY PROJECT NEWSLETTER</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This February Larry Eigner died in Berkeley. He
was 68 years old.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lifelong student of "the drunk stagger of human
affairs," he has&nbsp; been our grandest poet of human ecology for over
40 years, a writer&nbsp; who confounds the frail distinction between man-made
and natural&nbsp; with charm and imagination. Animal, vegetable, and mineral
all excited his mind. His "nature" included both bird and wire, dinosaurs&nbsp;
and distant stars. For Eigner, poverty disturbs our ecology no less than
toxic waste. Ten years ago, responding to a questionnaire, he wrote:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kps me interested (overload
or not)? Ears
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and eyes, I guess. Being alive. . . .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If life on other planets were
feasible and known
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough!! Wow!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eigner's work has been important for several generations
of writers, beginning with the Black Mountain Poets of the 1950s. His first
book, <I>From the Sustaining Air</I>, was brought out in 1953 by Robert
Creeley, eliciting a quick cheer from William Carlos Williams. A large
collection followed from Jonathan Williams in 1960, <I>On My Eyes</I>,
prefaced with a note by Denise Levertov. Also in 1960 <I>The New American
Poetry</I> appeared, with Eigner grouped in the opening section, alongside
Olson, Duncan, Creeley, Blackburn, and Levertov. In the years since, Eigner
has published more than 50 books, and
<BR>appeared in more than 150 magazines.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gestural clarity of Eigner's poems—their verbal
modesty and&nbsp; perceptual acuity, their signature shape and utilitarian
use of typewriter and page—are utterly without precedent. Superficially
they resemble the staggered stanzas of Williams and Marianne Moore, the
acrobatics of cummings, the random spill of Mallarme.&nbsp; But Eigner's
achievement is less a matter of formal innovation than an attitude about
life. Eigner took Modernism's hard-won freedom from mechanical reiteration
of shape and sound to a necessary conclusion in the freedom to follow his
mind wherever it might go,&nbsp; however near or far. Poetry hasn't looked
or felt the same since.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eigner was born with cerebral palsy, a condition
induced by medical&nbsp; incompetence. "The doctor, mother says, apologized
for not measuring her right. If he had, she's said, I would have been delivered
in the Caesarian way. The doctor told my folks they could sue him for&nbsp;
malpractice, but considering the thing an accident or something they&nbsp;
didn't, anyhow they let it go." Crysosurgery at age 35 freed him from the
uncontrollable wildness of his left side. Before then, notes Eigner, "in
order to relax at all I <I>had</I> to keep my attention partly away from&nbsp;
myself, <I>had</I> to seek a home, coziness in the world." Writing became
<BR>the focus of this outwardly turning attention:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
m e m o r y
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sky more
open
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and clouds passing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
because of the dead
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
tree there was
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in close to the eaves
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the hours they took
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to cut it down

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1986, Ron Silliman dedicated to Eigner <I>In the
American Tree</I>, an&nbsp; anthology of Language Writing. Eigner's response
is characteristic:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hm, maybe this "language" poetry is centered on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking--the descendant or else the parent of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speech?--rather than speech itself. Putting it up
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my alley. Thinking that gets man from one thing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the next. And realization, recognition or real
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awareness of things, may not be a different
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kettle of fish, much.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure how many poems Eigner wrote. My guess
is near 2500—best represented in four big Black Sparrow Press books, <I>Things
Stirring Together or Far Away</I> (1974), <I>The World and Its Streets,
Places</I> (1977), <I>Waters Places a Time</I> (1983), and <I>Windows Walls
Yards Ways</I> (1994). The last two were edited by Larry's longtime friend
Robert Grenier. A book of fiction was brought out in 1978 from This Press,
<I>Country Harbor Quiet Act Around</I>. In 1989,&nbsp; Roof Books published
a collection of Eigner's criticism, <I>Areas Lights Heights</I>. A new
book of poems is due momently from Sun &amp; Moon.
