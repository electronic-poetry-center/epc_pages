Unpublished Letter to Ina Forster</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp; <FONT SIZE=-1>[Ina Forster was a student of Russian and English
literature from Rostock who studied for a while at Brown University, where
she became introduced (through Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop) to Larry Eigner's
1979 Burning Deck book <I>Lined up Bulk Senses</I>. In 1987 she wrote Larry
a short letter requesting "some material" about his life, and asking about
his methods of composition and revision, his "favorite topics," and who
he wrote for. The following response took up six pages of densely packed
type. To give some flavor of the text in a form suitable for <I>Passages</I>,
I've treated each page of the letter as a separate text, placing L.E.'s
marginal notes underneath. Larry had the habit of using two dots as ellipses
(to abbreviate single words), as a way of saving energy while typing. And
long before E-Mail made similar shorthands necessary, he devised the formula
of only underlining the first and last letters of a title. He also had
the habit of wedging corrections and addenda by typewriter into or (more
often) near the appropriate place in the line, creating a surprisingly
lively visual field. In his preface to the collection of essays he and
I put together for Roof Books, Larry quoted Edmund Waller's verses on the
English language, "Poets that lasting Marble seek / Must carve in Latin
or in Greek / We write in Sand." Larry's sand—his page—was always in motion,
shifting as if under a subtle but refreshing sea-breeze. Nonetheless, in
preparing letters and other prose for publication (the poems are a somewhat
different matter), he generally favored regularizion as an aid to legibility,
as much as possible without robbing the text of its charm. His goal was
always to strike the right balance—Larry's poetics in a nutshell, and politics
too. (His deeply felt response to the ecology movement is a rarely noted
key to the work.) "Much more than enough boggles, drowns the mind and empties
it"--"How much is enough or too much?"—"How and/or how much things (can
be got to) go together (work) is some mystery."—"leavetaking of the ponderous":
These are teachings of Larry's that have stood me well the past ten years
or so, in dealing with Larry's work and my own. Aside from the helter-skelter
opening, what follows aims more for legibility than verisimilitude, I hope
without sacrificing "immediacy and force." In typing the marginal notations,
however, I've kept Larry's abbreviated spellings more or less intact. Unfortunately,
the "representative" poems sent along with this letter weren't copied.—B.F.]</FONT>

Last nght in San Francisco a friend took me
<BR>to see Rosmarie W.. give a talk abt Claude Royet-Journoud
<BR>and Anne-Marie Albiach in Paris--these 3 and a lot of
<BR>others have sent me bks and mag..s for abt 25-30 yrs and
<BR>many (R..-Journoud for one) have kept me busy by writing
<BR>me letters . . . (I went to a reading the Waldrops gave in
<BR>San Francisco in 1978 too.) Thursday, 6 days ago, a note
<BR>from Ros.. came with your January 19th letter (Brief)
<BR>enclosed. I can't tell how much of a chance there is this
<BR>will reach you in time to help with your thesis. I've got
<BR>pretty lazy by now (this August I'll be 60) and addicted
<BR>to diversions. X yrs ago I was typing enough, frequently
<BR>or fast enough with 1 finger to be able to write in the
<BR>semi-darkness, hardly glancing at the keys if at all. Now
<BR>I'm real slow and make quit a few mistakes (this is an
<BR>unusual day for me so far, I'm typing at a good clip,
<BR>speed, and looking at the keyboard). I have cerebral palsy
<BR>from a forceps injury at birth, I'm in a wheelchair for
<BR>instance while I can walk holding onto a railing or with
<BR>someone back of me. A few wks after my 35th birthday ("In
<BR>the middle of the journey of our life," as Dante begins
<BR>the Commedia), in September 1962, cryosurgery, a little
<BR>frostbite at the thalamus, freon gas, tamed my wild left
<BR>arm and leg (also numbed the left side of my body, but in
<BR>a few months the feeling came back to my face and ear). I
<BR>don't remember or know if my attention-span increased due
<BR>to that, but it might well have, for some while anyway,
<BR>till I more or less gave way to further distractions or
<BR>diversions: maybe I've bn abt as altruistic and/or
<BR>extroverted as before, though since the operation I
<BR>haven't needed to keep my attention away from myself so
<BR>much (in order to hold still, relax). If my physical
<BR>condition had thus been improved earlier, that might have
<BR>had more effect on my character. Because of abundance and
<BR>more than abundance, for one thing anyway, I hardly have
<BR>the idea of working any more, or work per se, but some
<BR>traces of it maybe remain. Abt 1970, 9-10 yrs after the
<BR>freon gas, my desire to write long pieces dimmed enough so
<BR>I got willing enough to end a poem at any point, any word,
<BR>I think that's how the poems got clearer, while before
<BR>they were Obscure much of the time. You can want something
<BR>or try to do something too much or too little, and the
<BR>question how much is enough there's never much of an
<BR>answer to, but enough at times, and anyway the question is
<BR>always there, is maybe useful, one way or another, if not,
<BR>anyhow, something in itself. I can't remember, either, not
<BR>thinking a poem a matter of luck or "serendipity" ("This
<BR>may be the last poem," I'd think, "I may not be able to do
<BR>another" . . . ). Except nowadays, often--things get
<BR>plentiful or routine or frequent and you expect more, you
<BR>don't think of "Lady Luck." And I don't, at that, come
<BR>across outstanding things in daily life so often, of
<BR>course, things I put down are likely dull or almost,
<BR>relatively dull (and I used to "hope against hope" as a
<BR>child, during exercises, physiotherapy, and other times,
<BR>I'm inclined to try and see if I can make use of
<BR>anything--besides taking comfort from toeholds, I took to
<BR>all kinds of mottoes, like "waste not, want not,"
<BR>seriously--also there's so much writing I try to consider

<BR>high and low frequencies, high-powered things and

<BR>you don't want to have too few pitches or colors or keys).
<BR>Well, there's both effort and luck, ah!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I read
of "energy construct" or
<BR>maintenance in Charles Olson's "Projective Verse" in the
<BR>early '50s, in <I>Poetry New York</I> (1950), I thought myself
<BR>that immediacy and force have to take precedence over
<BR>clarity in a poem (this in reaction to my mother, though I
<BR>tried or wd've liked to follow, agreed with her insistent
<BR>advice to be clear), and about the same time there was Wm
<BR>Carlos WIlliams! "A poem is a machine made of words" (he
<BR>was a medical doctor *ein Arzt?* but he said "machine,"
<BR>not "organism," hm). A piece of language that "works,"
<BR>functions. I "played by ear," felt my way along. I was
<BR>(and am rather) puzzled how theory is relevant. How to
<BR>apply it anyway. I'm a primitive (when writing do what I
<BR>can, when reading the likelihood I'm not getting much at
<BR>all of what's there seems large--if I'd gotten wheels and
<BR>cd thus explore more before age 10, fewer things beyond or
<BR>nearly beyond sight or hearing, my curiosity might have
<BR>been less, for example I might not have tried so to speak
<BR>to see through the walls of factories we walked or rode
<BR>past, although come to think of it there was some, hm,
<BR>yiddish spoken by my parents with theirs, and the italian
<BR>spoken by neighbors, the italian too fast for me to learn
<BR>any words, except "1, 2, 3," and loud and far away. I was
<BR>in a neighbor's house just 2 or 3 times). Until age 22
<BR>when I responded to maybe the first of Cid Corman's
<BR>programs "This Is Poetry," heard over a Boston
<BR>(Massachusetts) radio station (I lived abt 12 miles north
<BR>of Boston till I moved to Berkeley on Aug 31 '78, a couple
<BR>of miles from my brother) and he got me onto Dr Williams,
<BR>Pound and I think Stevens (and Hart Crane?), my idea of
<BR>poetry, picked up from public school (teachers came to my
<BR>house after I had 2-1/2 yrs at Mass. Hospital School south
<BR>of Boston, 5th-7th grades, then I took 7 correspondence
<BR>courses from the U.. of Chicago), was limited enough--I
<BR>thought rhyme or at least metre an essential, or a must,
<BR>as I was told, although at the same time I was curious
<BR>what there might really be to "free verse" (vers libre)--
<BR>there was some or after all more than a little of it in
<BR>the high school/college textbook which my brother, a
<BR>college freshman then, brought home during his first Xmas
<BR>vacation (yes, I did, sure), along with e.e. cummings'
<BR><I>Selected Poems</I>. Around then (December '49), before he
<BR>returned to school, he happened on Corman's program and
<BR>called me over to listen. Up through the '50s and '60s I'd
<BR>keep on the lookout constantly for poems, trying to keep
<BR>what came to me in my head if out in the car till I got to
<BR>the typewriter, successfully, trying to extend what I got
<BR>(if incomplete) once I started writing (like in school
<BR>years, as I vaguely remember, I used to go around all day
<BR>memorizing or remembering the lessons--school or anything
<BR>was a vacation compared to physiotherapy, frustrating and
<BR>sometimes scary as it was). I recall the idea of the set
<BR>or assigned (like in school) poem, of writing about a
<BR>certain thing or subject, and at any moment (all times)
<BR>there's the attempt, difficult or easy or taking only a
<BR>millisecond, say, immediately done with; but if you can't
<BR>do it, sometime's there'll be something else, so the poem
<BR>does become a thought process or arc or course of thought
<BR>or trace or artifact of the same, maybe more than a
<BR>machine made of words.

T h u r s d a y
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But further than a course or stretch of thinking,
or
<BR>more specifically, I seem to have got to the poem (piece
<BR>of language) as a full realization (well, not in a
<BR>majority of 2500 poems all told!) or recognition of things
<BR>come to (me)--in '71 or possibly '72, when I read in an
<BR>interview with Anselm Hollo his surmise that poetry is
<BR>finding things and putting em together (anyway as in
<BR>Provencal, the language of the Troubadors, "trobar" meant
<BR>"to make poems" as well as "to find": hm, he didn't say
<BR>"to find poems"). I thought at first, say in a flash of
<BR>hindsight, that what I'd been doing for some time was
<BR>finding things and evaluating, and quite a few months
<BR>later, maybe a year or over a year later, figured it
<BR>wasn't that so much, evaluation or weeding, assessing, as
<BR>it was just realizing things, because there's really no
<BR>hierarchy among them, no ranking, one thing is actually no
<BR>more important than another, or not for long. (The line-
<BR>break, /, or stanza-break, // (double-line-break, blank
<BR>line), can give emphasis, stress, where not obscured by
<BR>metre, regular, routine stress, it appears, while frequent
<BR>stress works at times, is appropriate.) Feeling your way
<BR>along, you can, it seems, discover the right value, so to
<BR>speak, momentary as it may be--nothing lasts forever, the
<BR>ephemeral is ok. It's never quite enough, though (anyway
<BR>there's always an amount of concern abt the future, your
<BR>own and x million others'), and like anything else the
<BR>present isn't to be exaggerated.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that, in a few lines of autobiography, done for the
<BR>anthology <I>A Controversy of Poets</I>, I wrote, "I'm
<BR>cautious, and come onto things by understatement. Wary of
<BR>exaggeration. Sotto voce has resulted in the suppression
<BR>of words. Don't like to begin with a big B, as if I was at
<BR>the Beginning of all speech, or anything: which may have
<BR>something to do with why I've had an aversion more or less
<BR>to going back to the left margin after beginning a poem,
<BR>but otherwise than in hindsight I just tried to do the
<BR>best I could, the simplest and most immediate thing being
<BR>punctuation, once words were forceful enough--a matter of
<BR>getting the distances between words, and usages of p..-
<BR>marks to conform as well as might be to what there was to
<BR>say, as spoken, then these typographical devices
<BR>themselves entering discovery and the initiation of
<BR>attention. As with any detail," if you don't take such a
<BR>device for granted, use it routinely or unnecessarily,
<BR>i.e., superfluously, redundantly--a capital letter
<BR>following a period for instance--it becomes available for
<BR>vital use in other situations. You could say the period
<BR>hasn't been abused, hasn't deteriorated, been worn out.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, as to "beginning with a big B"--when
I first
<BR>heard Corman I thought he didn't read poetry loudly and
<BR>boldly enough over the radio--I got the use of lower-case
<BR>letters and "sotto voce," also the non-routine use of
<BR>punctuation, from e.e. cummings (his using the"(" but
<BR>rarely if ever the ")" not closing a parenthesis seemed to
<BR>me "sotto voce"). And I guess when I mentioned
<BR>"suppression of words" I was forgetting that over the past
<BR>6-8(?) yrs I'd been eliminating connective words (more and
<BR>more in my head, automatically, less and less after
<BR>writing them down) to keep up the movement, the force
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>(as Olson had it) energy. When I took out a word after I'd
<BR>written it, rather than moving the next words on that line
<BR>leftwards, I'd leave the space open, not filled, I didn't
<BR>close it up, anyway at the beginning of a line, then
<BR>soon(?) I was indenting, not returning to the left margin
<BR>wholly or much at all, directly, per se (and the less of a
<BR>margin the less set and rigid a poem appeared, the more
<BR>easily it seemed, seems, to come off the page into speech,
<BR>into the head: so too, I've generally chosen not to put a
<BR>word flush with the word above it, even a few lines above
<BR>it, while I haven't held to such fine preferences for
<BR>decades, and words aren't the food or drink they used to
<BR>be). Of course a period says "Stop" and a comma says both
<BR>"stop" and "go on," whereas a lacuna (gap, space) just
<BR>says "stop" (or, rather, maybe, "pause"). Until today I've
<BR>thought it fairly strange and peculiar that recognition of
<BR>things (and ideas) should come about (partly) by cadence,
<BR>emphasis, tone of voice, or be conveyed thus, to a
<BR>listener or reader--no, communication hasn't been
<BR>strange--but it's people after all (speaking aloud or
<BR>silently, i.e. thinking) who give things meaning, which,
<BR>maybe, sooner or later is (about) the same as
<BR>recognition(?). Accuracy of the moment? Once, anyway, I
<BR>felt a poem was incomplete, but was struck, couldn't go
<BR>on, till the next day I was able to and could finish it,
<BR>after I put the last few words I'd got on 1 or 2 lines
<BR>instead of 2 or 3, put less emphasis on them. Or the
<BR>things or the idea(s) behind the words. This would
<BR>indicate I had something of an obsession the day before,
<BR>was somewhat fanatic (not that they were extraordinary--
<BR>"flat sky / going down / to leaves // birds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; river
/
<BR>sound . . .")--somewhere I got stuck in this March '73
<BR>piece (oder Stuck, ja!). While 16 months earlier, I now
<BR>see again, in a preface to a mimeographed magazine I
<BR>soloed in (#8 of EARTH SHIP, Feb 1972, Southampton, UK), I
<BR>had, "If a thing is hard enough, no one can do it. I enjoy
<BR>doing things that are easy enough. If it gets to be work,
<BR>physically tiring, still it's enjoyable work." (Also on
<BR>that page I quoted Creeley's words in a '61 review, read
<BR>in '71: "The line is the means to focus, . . . says how we
<BR>are to weigh the various things we are told"; after
<BR>mentioning I found the idea of poetry as "deliberate,
<BR>purposeful speech," in the same review, soon after I
<BR>thought of "a general addressing his army," rather than
<BR>table talk. "And writing a poem has often enough been like
<BR>discovering things.") So, yes, by late '71 I was getting
<BR>to think of evaluation and discovery, in re what I'd been
<BR>doing, and not trying too hard--a poem can extend itself
<BR>pretty much unexpectedly, like a walk you're out on, or,
<BR>I've also thought, a coda in music, if you're not too
<BR>willful. And I'd experienced new turns or twists of
<BR>thought before I had the sense of intent, of weighing
<BR>things. So in a sense doing a poem is like writing a
<BR>letter. Robert Creeley put me up to my first booklet,
<BR>which he issued from Mallorca in '53--one of the 10 poems
<BR>occasioned by his writing me about Rainer Gerhart in
<BR>bombed-out Freiburg; when RG died not long after, Ch.
<BR>Olson mourned him in one of his powerful poems. Gregory
<BR>Corso published 2 of the poems I sent (I probably sent
<BR>more than 2) when he wrote asking for stuff for the
<BR>english/deutsch anth..y he and Walter Hollerer edited
<BR>(<I>Junge</I> or maybe <I>Neue Amerikanischer Lyrik</I>, Carl Hanser
<BR>Verlag, Munich, 1961). June/July '74 a Michael Kohler came
<BR>to my house while he was in Gloucester 10 or so miles
<BR>north working on a thesis (U.. of Munich)

<BR>on Charles Olson and in 2 days I think made an audio-tape
<BR>of me reading 27 poems for s press (in Dusseldorf, I'm
<BR>pretty sure my memory says right, his partner was there in
<BR>D..), which together with the 12-1/2-minute tape ("around
<BR>new / sound daily / means") in '75 issued a german/english
<BR>booklet of the pieces, since when I speak I'm not easy to
<BR>understand even at my best (when I give a reading, as I've
<BR>been asked to do about 15 times, copies of what I'm
<BR>reading are handed out to the audience or else projected
<BR>on a wall or a screen). My first sizable collection, <I>On</I>
<BR><I>My Eyes</I> (88 or so poems), was published by Jonathan
<BR>Williams in 1960. He started his Jargon books in
<BR>Stuttgart, during his time in the U.S. Army. My book was
<BR>JARGON #36. Maybe he published Olson before he returned to
<BR>this country, to North Carolina. (Olson (1910-1970) was an
<BR>exuberant giant as you may have heard, man and writer--I
<BR>and my brother visited him once or twice (in '57 or 8 when
<BR>I showed him a poem, right away he pulled out his portable

<BR>he didn't get around to doing it, I got it done a while
<BR>after he returned it to me, it must've been to my
<BR>surprise.) I've had nine books out and 23 booklets (one of
<BR>the books is all prose, sketches, 2 others having some
<BR>prose), besides 3 mag..s I've "soloed" in (one of the 3 a
<BR>one-act skit or play plus a few poems--I no longer have
<BR>it). I've no doubt been through 2 or 3 "periods" . . . The
<BR>thing is, it's hard for me to select, too much for <I>me</I> to

<BR>long "free fantasias" of the '50s and early '60s--spare
<BR>copies. (I've at least 5 unpublished recent things on 2
<BR>sheets. A lot of what I've done, and most of what I've
<BR>written these 8 years in California, often seems rather
<BR>dull--the words fade out, for one thing anyway when
<BR>there's been so many--or a strong piece echoes something a
<BR>little stronger from years ago. Familiar sights are ok,
<BR>hm, but you don't like to repeat yourself but to do
<BR>something new or different each time. Or see things as if
<BR>new. It's like wanting to stay young, at that. Either that
<BR>or stop running around except if and when you feel like
<BR>it. Hm, I've tried not to repeat any word (so at times
<BR>this feels right and I've done it to good effect), for
<BR>instance in putting a booklet or book together (and a
<BR>title is part of a book). Well, what's kind of old to the
<BR>writer may be new enough to the reader, so you can't

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In margin:] Ysterday I typed up a few thngs
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (enclosed), picked out others

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In margin:] not "a press" as on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acknowledgment page of my 1977 bk <U>The World
and</U>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Its Streets, Places</U>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In margin:] I'm pretty sure JARGON SOCIETY
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOOKS are at Brown U.. Library (the "Rockefeller
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection" there?)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In margin:] Ah well, maybe writing
(and of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; course rding) does abt as much (or little)
as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anything else in this complicated--multiplex--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world of ours.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In margin:] I wrote the <I>lined up bulk
senses</I>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sequence in Dcmber, of '63, I'm pretty sure
(I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recall its date being wrong--'65?--in a B..
Deck
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listing not whre it was !--and I cdn't locate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ts in my file today either. I got the

<BR>much tell what and how much not to show other people.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two of the enclosed
typescripts (or
<BR>photostats or carbon copies of them) were done by Rbt
<BR>Grenier, a poet I live with here, a couple of miles away
<BR>from my brother's, since December 1 '79, my first fifteen
<BR>months in Berkeley I had a room elsewhere. (Bob first got
<BR>in touch with me in early '71, after writing me in
<BR>December '70, when he was living north of me on Cape Ann
<BR>where Gloucester is and teaching south of me in Tufts U..,
<BR>then in the Spring, as he proposed to do, helped me to put
<BR>a book together, my '77 book, and for instance in '79
<BR>edited and typed up my '83 book. He's a friend of Creeley,
<BR>whose <I>Selected Poems</I> from Scribner's he edited (somehow
<BR>unacknowledged), and of Anselm Hollo, who's from Helsinki
<BR>originally, has been in the U.S. 14 or 15 years at least,
<BR>after some time in England. Must've been in about '73 he
<BR>dropped by my place, before or after seeing Olson in
<BR>Gloucester, and in talking with him my mother said my
<BR>Eigner grandfather came from the Hungarian part of Austria
<BR>(-Hungary)--only time I've heard that. Grandma Eigner came
<BR>from Galicia. Hollo the Hungarian for "crow"--the noun, as
<BR>I took it, the bird--his family came to Finland from
<BR>Hungary at some point. As for my mother, she was brought
<BR>here from Lithuania, near Bialostok, when she was 1 year
<BR>old or so. Creeley and Hollo have both of them stayed here
<BR>for a while . . .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Grenier, some time before I met him in '71,
did
<BR>some translations of Georg Trakl, maybe I once knew just
<BR>about how many or few. Kind of wistful or sad?, "dark
<BR>flutes in autumn . . . ," something like that, a quote at
<BR>the top of a story of Creeley's, I pretty well remember;
<BR>and in'74 somebody passed on to me a booklet of Trakl, in
<BR>another's English.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always mean to write short letters,
of course, do
<BR>thngs quickly. Huh! Well, these ten or 15 yrs I haven't
<BR>kept up with anyone (or anything) for long. Anyway, I
<BR>seldom take the time to take a look at the clock!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>Don't puzzle over my handwriting on these pages--notes abt
<BR>books, booklets, magazines.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not bothering to make a record of what
I'm
<BR>sending you. I've scribbled poems in notebooks at times,
<BR>when away at my brother's for instance (and once on a
<BR>loose sheet did what turned out to be a 2-page poem (in ts
<BR>or 1960 or developed into it, on the sidewalk in front of
<BR>my house). Records better typed, though, on loose sheets.
<BR>I have a folder to keep them and other things in, propped
<BR>open in a pulled-out drawer, but I've misplaced 3 or 4,
<BR>they seem to have disappeared into thin air. It may take
<BR>another week to mail this--ah well. I can't do it too fast
<BR>myself. Maybe a photostat of this letter can be taken with
<BR>no delay in mailing--a book of my letters is being
<BR>assembled and this mght be a good outline, maybe a bit of
<BR>it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In margin, cont. from margin of previous

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (it wasn't a collection). Oh yes, they asked
to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see something to pblish. This was one of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; times I was able to imagine some thngs:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "grandfather . . . You . . . were playing
/ a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; game . . ." There was feeling, while now non-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sequitors are more so, less forceful than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; puzzling, or more often that. Such turns of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thought as "midnight / doesn't make itself"
new
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; realizations come onto suddenly enough in
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midst of writing, occurred rather often in
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '60s and '60s. (Evaluation for 1 thng is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking, I've thought.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In margin:] A few of the thngs here haven't
bn
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; published, maybe not shown to any editor.
