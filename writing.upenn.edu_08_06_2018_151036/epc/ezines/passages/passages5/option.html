<UL>&nbsp; Ode to Odessa
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp; Too odd ode
<BR>&nbsp; said ode sad
<BR>&nbsp; toad add odd
<BR>&nbsp; sod sat to ate
<BR>&nbsp; his gills were problematic
<BR>&nbsp; this used to be a different place
<BR>&nbsp; made of Saturday pirogies
<BR>&nbsp; and big pigs and
<BR>&nbsp; cows now on she
<BR>&nbsp; snow blower, add
<BR>&nbsp; flown as a sound
<BR>&nbsp; meower second
<BR>&nbsp; hour flip through
<BR>&nbsp; not go out with rising
<BR>&nbsp; horns which Vlad
<BR>&nbsp; will cherish &amp; love
<BR>&nbsp; when I started growing blonde
<BR>&nbsp; as a soldier
<BR>&nbsp; amputated by war
<BR>&nbsp; unwanted &amp; friendless
<BR>&nbsp; cherishes his last
<BR>&nbsp; remaining leg
<BR>&nbsp; I cherish what passes
<BR>&nbsp; lovingly from my hands
<BR>&nbsp; effortlessly
<BR>&nbsp;
