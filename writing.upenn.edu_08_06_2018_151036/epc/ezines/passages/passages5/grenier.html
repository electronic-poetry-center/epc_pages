<B>SO QUICK BRIGHT THINGS COME TO CONFUSION</B>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So quick bright
things come to confusion

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With five speech stresses first five words
(syllables),
<BR>in effect the line has `run its course' by (age 17?) the time it
<BR>just gets started -- like a firework (stormy night sky) at
<BR>height of its ascension -- how beautiful, how tragic ! --
<BR>thence plunge into Chaos of (unstressed 5-syllable) metrical oblivion.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larry Eigner's life work was not like that
-- he lived
<BR>(`quick') to the end (`smart'), a long life for someone
<BR>with cerebral palsy, he brought said life's work to completion
<BR>(rare thing amongst humans) &amp; had more or less stopped typing.
<BR>He said possibly he should be in Guinness world records.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lived in his body as few do -- his profile
&amp; bearing
<BR>were that of a `figure from Egyptian mythology' -- a fully
<BR>achieved (Jewish) animal. He got himself in &amp; out of bed, went
<BR>to the toilet, sat in his chair, walked holding on to a bar some
<BR>distance up &amp; down the ramp outside, ate with a fork, digressed
<BR>in his monologues, watched television, traversed in his
<BR>electric wheelchair down the ramp (around corners) &amp; around &amp;
<BR>about in much of Berkeley, went to readings, complained about
<BR>me to Jack (Foley), thought/saw &amp; typed his terrific poems --
<BR>i.e. generally conducted himself as an Angel amongst us.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Angel he was (like Spinoza in benevolence,
all-over beneficence).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not always `good' -- but he did what
Angels are
<BR>supposed to do, on the page -- pure (seeing) doing. Thus anyone may,
can.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larry's work does not derive from his palsy
-- it is not
<BR>`an heartening example of what somebody with cerebral palsy can
<BR>do' (i.e. look out his window). It is where the species may go
<BR>with Language through Stream of Time -- towards engagement
<BR>with strange/holy fact of what's (`always') happening ("how
<BR>or why" as he wonders it) before you. Like Emily Dickinson's,
<BR>it's an `example' for all of us `regular Americans' how to
<BR>think/see/feel/move.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And believe -- believe in the world thought
<BR>transacting in front of you. In the words (world). See it,
<BR>imagine it &amp; write it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it is sad that he died,
at all. And
<BR>perished. In that sense Shakespeare is accurate (`quick' is
<BR>`the dead' without possibly nonexistent adverb `quickly'). Too
<BR>bad the handicapped die too!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his funeral oration, Larry's brother Richard
observed
<BR>first-handedly &amp; with emotion that Larry had a strong will &amp;
that
<BR>he was an American poet. His brother Joe followed &amp; emphasized
<BR>Larry's commitment to liberal causes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just open a book, any book -- by Larry Eigner
--
<BR>sorting, with finger pointing to some place on a page --You
<BR>will find something. For your mind &amp; heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
