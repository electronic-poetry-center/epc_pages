<br>
Way down inside,<br>
I always knew why<br>
I had wun affinity<br>
wit da land of da rising sun.<br>
<p>
And now,<br>
several anthropologists<br>
like confirm da reason<br>
wit wun new theory: Dey say<br>
	dat wen<br>
	some of da ancient Polynesians<br>
	wen migrate,<br>
	dey wen start furdah up north<br>
	in Asia<br>
	den previously believed,<br>
	wit da taught <br>
	dat dey wen pass through Japan<br>
	and wuz deah<br>
	way before da Japanees.<br>
<br>
Eh, I could've told 'um dat,<br>
cause all dat info stay stuck<br>
deep in my collective na`au, brah.<br>
<br>
I found all dat out<br>
wen I wen meditate.<br>
<br>
	Somehow,<br>
	wit relaxed breathing<br>
	and witout drugs,<br>
	I wen realize<br>
	dat I could tune in<br>
	to my ancestral heritage<br>
<br>
	foa contemplate<br>
	da long look back.<br>
	And suddenly,<br>
	like coming through wun tunnel,<br>
	everyting look different,<br>
	and I could see<br>
	cherry blossoms<br>
	falling,<br>
	wit beautiful Mt. Ke`oke`o<br>
	in da distance -<br>
<br>
		-Namoku`eha<br>
			(dats da original name<br>
			foa Japan, brah),<br>
			wuz wun nice place,<br>
			but wen da wintah wen come,<br>
			Cuz!  Wuz too damn cold!<br>
			Dat wuz wun of da reasons<br>
			we wen hele on!<br>
<br>
	Plus, Maka Nui,<br>
	our chief and best navigatah,<br>
	(who wasn't too crazy<br>
	 about da cold weadah eidah),<br>
	wen figgah<br>
	dat if we can find<br>
	dis place off of da continent,<br>
	den maybe get adah places<br>
	out deah too1 -<br>
	-And bettah yet,<br>
	maybe da new places<br>
	stay moa warm.<br>
<br>
	Wat amazing vision, <br>
	cause Maka wuz right.<br>
<br>
			You heard<br>
			of da Bermuda Triangle, eh?<br>
<br>
		Well,<br>
		Maka Nui and da Polynesian `ohana,<br>
		wen embark<br>
		on wat became known as <br>
		"Da Great Uliuli Boomerang."<br>
<br>
		First,<br>
		he wen sail us<br>
		from Namoku`eha<br>
		into da far unknown,<br>
		all da way to wun place<br>
		he wen name aftah his fadah - <br>
		-Hawai`i, brah,<br>
		wheah warm weadah<br>
		and malo-s<br>
		wuz happily discovered.<br>
<br>
		Den,<br>
		high on success,<br>
		Maka wen take us<br>
		on wun unbelivable dig<br>
		from Hawai`i,<br>
		to wun island<br>
		off da coast<br>
		of wat is now<br>
		known as Chile.<br>
		He wen<br>
		name da place<br>
		aftah his cousin<br>
		on his madah's side,<br>
		Rapa,<br>
		who wuz wun<br>
		unreal stonecuttah.<br>
<br>
		From deah,.<br>
		confident in his moves,<br>
		Maka wen head south<br>
		from Rapanui,<br>
<br>
			and wen find<br>
			on da horizon<br>
			wun new land<br>
			undah wun long white cloud.<br>
			He wen stick out his tongue<br>
			in excitement<br>
			and shouted, "Aotearoa!,"<br>
			unknowingly<br>
			naming da place<br>
			right on da spot.<br>
<br>
			Next,<br>
			wit da quest of moa islands<br>
			in his eyes,<br>
			Maka<br>
			wen sail back north again,<br>
			and came upon Tahiti,<br>
			named foa his madah,<br>
			wheah<br>
			da first bottles<br>
			of Hinano wuz brewed,<br>
			to mark da occasion.<br>
<br>
			And finally,<br>
			from Tahiti,<br>
			using his magnificent<br>
			navigational skills,<br>
			Maka Nui<br>
			wen sail da remaining `ohana<br>
			back to Hawai`i,<br>
			thus completing <br>
			"Da Great Uliuli Bomerang."-<br>
<br>
			-And all because<br>
			Namoku`eha wuz too cold.<br>
<br>
			Incredible!<br>
			History is truly fascinating.<br>
<br>
And sometimes now<br>
knowing all of dis,<br>
I have taughts from da heart<br>
of someday<br>
going back to Namoku`eha,<br>
to trace da steps<br>
of my ancestors,<br>
and see<br>
wheah Maka Nui once lived.<br>
Wit da rising sun<br>
rising,<br>
I would find myself<br>
surrounded by trees,<br>
wheah I would sit<br>
in silence, <br>
undah da reach<br>
of blooming branches.<br>
And as da day<br>
brightened<br>
to wun softah blue,<br>
I would peacefully watch<br>
in slow motion,<br>
da gentle<br>
and inspiring<br>
cherry blossoms<br>
fall-<br>
<br>
		-But den again,<br>
		sentimentality aside,<br>
		maybe visiting Namoku`eha today,<br>
		would be about as interesting<br>
		as going to Pearl City<br>
		foa da very same reason -<br>
<br>
		-too many Japanees!<br>

Artificial Curiosities</b><br>
<br>
<br>
A low grumble of earth<br>
trembling mountains<br>
and everything quakes<br>
a prolonged shiver that rattles the world<br>

From below the foundations<br>
of a plantation-style cottage, there is a low humming sound<br>
that won't disappear, a murmuring almost imperceptible<br>
then the shaking subsides but does not stop<br>
<br>
At this moment, there are no<br>
trans-Pacific flights<br>
approaching the reef runway<br>
off Diamond Head,<br>
but I can hear my neighbor,<br>
an elementary school principal,<br>
shrieking<br>
at his 8-year old son<br>
<br>
From where does this low hum originate?<br>
not from the steady stream of cars<br>
cruising the streets<br>
<br>
Museums displaying<br>
fine specimens,<br>
striking colors sealed in<br>
controlled environments:<br>
Reading<br>
ArtificialCuriosities<br>
"An Exposition of Native Manufacturers<br>
Collected on the Three Pacific Voyages<br>
of Captain James Cook, R.N."<br>
thumbing my way<br>
toward a section called<br>
"Owhyhee or the Sandwich Isles."<br>
Living images,<br>
housed in museums and collections<br>
throughout the world<br>
documented, catalogued<br>
and "safe"<br>
protected so long as they remain<br>
"artifacts" which can maintain traceable, pedigree ancestries:<br>

Plant-dyed kapa, scented with extracts of flowers,<br>
fragrant woods or leaves from Laka's vine;<br>
Polished wood-smooth tools and sharks' teeth;<br>
musical instruments worn like personal adornments;<br>
Weapons and apparel of power;<br>
religion of gods and feather dwellings<br>
"Artificial Curiosities"?<br>
<br>
<br>
Low rumbling thunder, distant,<br>
within the earth<br>
<br>
Scraping of stone blade upon rock.<br>
Incandescence of amber rape lights<br>
interior illumination, the red-eyed video camera<br>
<br>
From beneath the decaying cities,<br>
museum walls shatter,<br>
splintering display cases,<br>
hum of magic, words melting words, images<br>
transfusing red mulberry dye,<br>
disintegrating, transforming<br>
<br>
Foundations crumbling, brittle;<br>
ear-splitting thunder<br>
<br>
Towering mountain faces,<br>
a blackened night sky issuing flashes of light.<br>
Tendons straining,<br>
mother-of-pearl eyes and mouths agape,<br>
jagged tongues of lightning,<br>
and the "bowl with human images" appears<br>
above the vast portals, twin tunnels, openings, grey concrete vaults collapsing,<br>
beneath the white-toothed mouths, blood red and gaping.<br>
<br>
Two valleys of concrete and steel collapse.  And rising from mountain peaks<br>
mammoth sculptures;<br>
emerging human images of rock, skin like dyed kapa, dark as earth,<br>
crouching, luminescent eyes, wide, like pohaku kekea,<br>
arms and feet rooted in stone and earth yet bursting upward,<br>
swallowing strips of towering highway<br>
like a ribbon of clouds above the valley floors,<br>
the crushing weight of countless waterfalls<br>
roaring from multi-fingered fisted cliffs.<br>
<br>
Museum pieces<br>
as tall as mountains<br>
as alive as<br>
hurricane wind<br>
and endless downpour<br>
of rain<br>
<br>
<br>
Artificial Curiosities, indeed<br>
<br>
...artificial curiosities...<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you<br>
an artificial curiosity?<br>

<br>
Translating An Anthropological Field Trip</b><br>
<br>
I walked from Tuscany to Fruitvale<br>
<br>
Up and down streets<br>
Barking and howling at strangers<br>
Sniffing for your car<br>
Wondering if anyone spotted<br>
An ear similar to your own<br>
The pleasure of frogs mating<br>
Or, an arm with guitar fingers<br>
<br>
If I were a dog<br>
men would have offered me a drink<br>
Instead, I was ignored<br>
A white woman lost<br>
between good english and cigarette smoke<br>
<br>
Panting near the memory of your heart<br>
I expected you to call me<br>
<br>
And then day began to resemble night<br>
<br>
No food, no love, no you<br>
What to believe in but miracles!<br>
<br>
What as particles in this life<br>
except to<br>
bark and wag looking forward to<br>
<br>
a pat on the head<br>
permission to whiff the crotch<br>
or chase the ball<br>

<br>
You yourself produced I me they ensure<br>
recognition outside the silent pictures in the current<br>
lexicon of images swarming toward light.  It was cropped,<br>
manipulated, a fantail inviting personal reveries,<br>
the graphic trace of their rituals eases<br>
up the visual scale and lands a flat clear spill.<br>
Positioned for disaster at points of display<br>
in the family album; perhaps some small<br>
shift in the light offered a sea of evidence<br>
roaring through life.<br>
<br>
Another immutable form, somebody's blazing<br>
spectrum played out elegant solutions and borrowed<br>
my voice.  Being unable to imagine the next<br>
ten seconds I aspire to the physical before it<br>
hurries away.  A designer intellect to go with the<br>
food altogether loses its capacity to fill and pranced past<br>
through a difficult calligraphy.  The night is my animal<br>
to call the geese swans and cut some slack<br>
revealing our itinerant beginnings, trawling for genes<br>
although we cannot slope around forever.<br>
<br>
The elimination of previous demarcations<br>
reveals, for me, a sly penchant for inaccuracies.  But<br>
these are not the questions asked when counting<br>
the hours before sleep the way a miser counts formulae.<br>
Deposits hang fire.  Instruments maps dotted lines<br>
measures of rainforest trails.  lt has all converged<br>
on this point, I repeat:  here is the course you take<br>
travelling, here is the waterfall.  The gaze<br>
will lose itself, come to that, on the lower slopes<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
where the rains the ashes the powder track<br>
before I stood redundant.  It could be seen as<br>
<br>
a parting shot and an ensemble of texts<br>
(discursive transactions, then) and protocols of<br>
appreciation.  A podium for one's introspection.<br>
Difficult to resist the pull of the vistas of unvisited<br>
landscapes where it is said the cassowary is<br>
retreating further into an unidentifiable space.<br>

In that context your rear is mud if you<br>

vocabulary provided juicy news<br>
<br>
unlike a thick population of<br>
scavenger birds,   great irony<br>
or just good strategy     it could reach in<br>
unknown or unwanted ways downstream<br>
gradually becoming inaudible<br>
<br>
there is a muzzled<br>
discussion occupying a cultural limbo<br>
in which meetings of consequence occur<br>
a mobile bearer of meaning<br>
arrived suddenly<br>
<br>
persistent urban myths on parallel<br>
migration routes     like mountain whistlers<br>

"builded here . . . among these . . . mills" - Blake<br>
<br>
Up here on Boot Hill, this spring '94,<br>
your squat cold monument still scours the sky<br>
as it did when Keir from Grafton laid concrete<br>
blocks by day & ran The Fat Landlady<br>
for those with minds that could not sleep at night<br>
up in Symonds St 25 years ago<br>
& poetry freed the dérive of the word<br>
by publishing the départ of the subject<br>
(set fire to the sarcophagus<br>
of good literature).  But now<br>
in this now<br>
<br>
in this 1940 pee-yellow, grot-pink<br>
reliquary concrete garden with its<br>
plinths & pedestals untopped by intended<br>
erections & its words that one needs not<br>
more fame than comes from the love of the people,<br>
from this cliff-edge where the grass chokes with<br>
phthisis of green & under a pergola<br>
one person nuzzles another/ territory of the<br>
Nation made over to the quickie<br>
where the present is all past<br>
& every animal is sad afterwards<br>
<br>
an arbitrary seagull dips east<br>
into the bleating wind watched by the eye<br>
of the savage sea (East! East! This East<br>
 is wholly West!)<br>
Fly East, young gull!<br>
Now left has been made right & right made left<br>
a warp rags the weft of the sky,<br>
up-harbour distant winded city,<br>
1st of October -<br>
yesterday my daughter turned 12, she's<br>
down below the point right now celebrating,<br>
child of a child of the welfare state<br>
riding Kelly Tarlton's simulacrum<br>
of Antarctica -<br>
<br>
<br>
voices, voices,<br>
<br>
<br>
Listen!  Tourist voices  climbing<br>
Bastion Point ("In San Francisco<br>
even in January the air was brighter")<br>
to the Look-out.  Look out!  Look back!<br>
"Hear but do not listen,<br>
See but do not look,<br>
Place your ear to earth<br>
& read it like a book:<br>
if you prise the hero from the story,<br>
you must find your own way home."<br>
Take the road back, pick up the threads<br>
where your death began, back there where<br>
<br>
that river slides under charred fog, hugs shaggy<br>
banks of gravel sand, acacia & willow trail,<br>
periscope eyes of eels gimlet, that creek<br>
up which I found myself born sans paddle,<br>
the stepping-into-never-twice into which now<br>
I step again/ you make me see again<br>
its green eyes keen under the town's high<br>
bridges/from source to mouth do you know?<br>
does the water stand? is it the banks that flow?<br>
from desire to illusion?  What now's<br>
<br>
the look out for the language, the you<br>
plus you plus you of history, & which<br>
language do you mean when you say the living are<br>
already dead but the dead, they live, they live!<br>
The graven kibosh on your stone<br>
reminds me of the simple tasks<br>
God never cared for like<br>
making the flesh word or cancelling the invasion<br>
or building the city of heaven on earth or<br>
climbing here to speak with you to make<br>
<br>
an old love new except you are not here &<br>
cannot be.  But are builded in this now.<br>
The invasion began again today.     The Herald<br>
said so.  Saigon.  Waikato.  Port au Prince.<br>
When a person dies, it said, a whole world<br>
dies with them.  & when a language.<br>
Sorry, comrade.  It goes without saying.<br>
 Old mate, the kiss of talk awakes desire.<br>

<br>
With such a chasm between minds<br>
there's a great opportunity<br>
to fill in the gaps with emptiness or sweetness<br>
humor or rage<br>
take a pick<br>
<br>
red flea watches silence grow like the bush<br>
day by day<br>
month to month<br>
year by year<br>
and sees just how lonely it can be<br>
to hold one's tongue<br>
<br>
but red flea feels the rage<br>
and does battle even in silence<br>
<br>
watch that politician<br>
he's just dying to scratch his crotch<br>
red fleas are driving him crazy<br>
<br>
that politician <br>
thinks the world actually believes his pronouncements<br>
about world peace<br>
and computer simulations<br>
for nuclear deterrence sometime in the future<br>
but only<br>
after exploding poisonous bomb after nuclear bomb in the South Pacific<br>
at the eclipse<br>
of our 20th century<br>
<br>
"la mer de la merde" is what he says to the world<br>
even though he thinks what he is saying<br>
is "vive la France, vive la France, vive la France..."<br>
"la mer de la merde" is what he's saying to the world<br>

Baby boy, as if fish-eyes on a rifle-butt<br>
Water is a wound<br>
<br>
Eulogize only once<br>
Few poets have done so-<br>
I want to kill greedy farmers, fat geese<br>
Withdraw my blood and sweat<br>
<br>
No robust words<br>
Justice and tribulations, flowing over rocks<br>
Icy-cold and hot<br>
<br>
Covered the parrot<br>
Torn bits of a calendar like vestiges of snow<br>
Hold the line amid chaos<br>
<br>
2.<br>
Games of war, on the verge of death<br>
Shattered umbrella:<br>
Wicked child over-zealous<br>
Like the Demon King and the Beauty<br>
<br>
Steadily unfurl my spiritual food<br>
Read books, feel interest-hypocritical<br>
Seeds fell to the ground yesterday<br>
Amid fleabane a hardworking chef<br>
<br>
Tear open copper wires<br>
Break the nerves of fallen flowers, higher up<br>
Spirals enshroud wine-cups<br>
<br>
In black and white<br>
Only a horse, at full gallop<br>
Again swells the shattered umbrella<br>
3.<br>
So deep, until past the footpath<br>
A ray of light transparents, sand and eggshells<br>
Glass cannot fragment     ocher sets off<br>
Green blood<br>
<br>
A long forgotten fragrance<br>
Remembering and forgetting<br>
In the corner of the wall a half-hidden ox-head, can't stand<br>
The desire to descend<br>

I come from what year's indifference?  Indifference<br>
Amid romance     a hand moves, like an opened book-cover<br>
Then hurriedly closes<br>

Such deep shyness, only<br>
The flora on the sea bottom (fantastic<br>
Limbs) is not covered with dust<br>
<br>
4.<br>
The soughing wind, murder and an open grave<br>
Adamant short-tailed parrot, at this moment it<br>
Glitteringly taps<br>
Replies to the singing<br>
<br>
A mortal being, yet I eulogize your immortality<br>
Fishness on arrow-heads<br>
Crooked teeth marks<br>
Woman in white, tranquil around the circular rim<br>
<br>
The inextinguishable,<br>
The butchered,<br>
The flute-playing, delicate throat<br>
<br>
Catacombs<br>
The classics you peruse<br>
Spiders resplendent leaves<br>

Seasons are either broad brushstrokes or little dots.<br>
There is no in between.  The TV is either on or off.<br>
I'm not over my head in love yet.  Or is love life?<br>
Wriggling dusts itself on, a Nestea plunge seen as<br>
a leap of faith.  What is the time that passes<br>
terribly slow if no one knows what time is?<br>
What is lumber but kindling in a scorching summer?<br>
And why is meaning such a proofless cross to carry<br>
when you feel you make it or break it, but never both at once,<br>
since it costs more to eat than shit, except at christmas,<br>
as if one bad apple can spoil the whole DDT sprayed bunch<br>
and the voice has not made the wilderness it winks in<br>
in a myth we have to pass through, but no doubt should<br>
edit out for the kind of network cameras we make fun of,<br>
as if we're out of time,<br>
<br>
We'd reject such dreams if the end were analysis, or<br>
we can afford to flunk the final and are gamblers, all of us,<br>
cunning in our alienation and our wonder and that cunning<br>
is what keeps us together, as if glued to our seats so long<br>
soon paranoia seems a vacation where once it was but a price<br>
to be paid for the pleasure of being watched.  And this is nothing<br>
if not involved with love, though someone stole my name<br>
and robbed theft as well and there is no drama but memory<br>
and hope even in the hottest chicken so the zoo<br>

Adding "Poetry" to Chaos Theory<br>
to Find a Poem</b><br>
<br>
Suppose you have concocted a mathematical<br>
model in biology or economics "poetry"<br>
you put this model on your computer<br>
and you discover <br>
a Feigenbaum period-doubling cascade<br>
which is often a sign<br>
that chaos is present<br>
is this result interesting?<br>
<br>
well, probably not<br>
one reason is that the detailed<br>
dynamical properties of your model<br>
may not have anything to do<br>
with the properties of the real-life system<br>
<br>
another reason why your discovery may be<br>
without interest<br>
is that the occurrence<br>
of a Feigenbaum cascade<br>
need not have any particular<br>
biological or economic "poetry" significance<br>
you still have to address the problem<br>
of the relevance of your finding<br>
for biology or economics "poetry"<br>
