Howzit Chuck,<br>
<br>
Eh Chuck, da odda day one guy from San Diego wen go ask me<br> "any luck?" He no could understand da Penn 6.0 and da <br>eleven foot half-and-half. I wen go tell him Eh pal, lemme <br>tell you someting: da ulua no bite cuz da commercial guys <br>wen go surround net da whole goddam school outside Hale <br>Nanea. Now only get fillets down foodland and "island seared <br>ulua wit' tossed baby Kula greens een one mango-papaya <br>chutney" (or some kind Pacific Rim cuisine shit).<br>
<br>
You take someting out, someting else come eenside-da place no <br>go be da same. Smoke dope behind da coas' guard boat aftah <br>jus' pau hook weke, all frustrated cuz nevah hook jack, live <br>opae mo' bettah dan california shrimp she tell you. Call your <br>people, brah, no joke right hea ten o'clock brah, you like see <br>how us take keah dakine Whale Foundation haole, you go <br>look undaneat' your slip at Ma'alaea-puhi and dakine kuanohu <br>crab grinding 'um. Your kau kau all Kula cabbage, <br>all canned corned beef, all Kula onions. All figuration <br>demarcation wit' dunking spikes in da coarse sand down <br>Pa'ia Bay, goddam only hippies and windsurfahs datside <br>already. In Kahului harbor the Love Boat exuding piss shit <br>champagne; your zoom lens captures the lone, wrinkled Maui <br>Local fisherman gesturing in a sign language you find <br>charmingly regional (but try look mo' hard, brah-ass' not <br>shaka she show you). Little bit too early befoa Pau hana time <br>da county guys grind ahi poke drink Bud Light talk story <br>under da jacaranda tree they wen' just pau trim cuz da high makamaka <br>local Japanee neighbor (doctah, I tink) everytime complain <br>da branches infiltrate his territory, and all da flowahs fall <br>eenside da satellite dish.<br>
<br>
Bamboo Ridge not da only place fo' catch ulua, brah-get oddah <br>places too. Get Lone Kiawe, get Lone Pine, get Makena <br>Lighthouse, get OP10, get plenny oddah places, bu'. Da <br>meaning of fishing not only papio or ulua too-it's using <br>ha'ukeuke fo' go catch panunu uhu, den grinding da <br>ha'ukeuke cuz da uhu no bite cuz get couple Japanee touris' <br>wit' dakine hot pink snorkle splashing around. It's going <br>Makena side fo' go hook mu and no can find "public access" <br>cuz get some moa hotels wen grow ovahnight.<br>
<br>

So lemme tell you, Chuck, I stay feeling da dialectic at da <br>intersection of Haleakala and Hana Highway-airport or <br>where? Begin graduate school on the west coast to theorize <br>"da local," leaving right in da middle of da bes' 'oama run in <br>four-five yeahs, but hard fo' get job at UH if you no leave UH, <br>'ah? So wen da haole ask me "why don't you jus' stop fishing <br>here and move somewhere else?," I tell him when all you see <br>is nature cyborgs hopping from Pa'ia to Wailea to Kihei to <br>Lahaina to Kula, stopping to dine at the Wunderbar Cafe, <br>Stouffer's, Tony Roma's, David Paul's, and the Kula Lodge, <br>you no can see how important dis "place" ees?<br>
<br>
K-den Chuck, maybe nex' time I get some shots fo' show you.<br>
<br>
