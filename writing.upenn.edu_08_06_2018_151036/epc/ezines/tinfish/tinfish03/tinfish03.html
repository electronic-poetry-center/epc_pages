We Try Harder</b>

The imposter postulates an originary
rite beside the tree beside the road
where storm chasers collide with updrafts
and wind chimneys pivot crazy ballroom
two-steps plagiarized from manuals about
improving relations between partners
after the bankrupcy of individualism.

Blank Thoreaus hamletize under shadows
of trains, munching home baked cookies
as half-baked oversouls somersault
the altitudinous air in a simulacrum
East where, rumor has it, ideals sprang
like slinkies from the ash sodden trench
of Ganges or Yangtze, yellow rivers
to dip your censored crosses in; this
trade deficit in creation myths exhumes
others' fears of immigrants, their authentic
instruments making hybrid noise of tin
can and erhu, gong and guitar, the piano
an exoskeleton whose harmonic ribs are
plucked from the hearts of those purists
stranded in "the happiest place on earth."

Minnie Mouse is the feminine ideal--and
she has her own house, too!--while
Mickey holds audiences for worshiping
kids and adults stunned in an early phase,
call it paleolithic, who reach to touch
his ear or uniform, adjusted to the size
of an invisible actor earning extra
summer dough. Vocations are also the art
of self-suspension, bridge over the river

Disbelief where Michener natives enjoy
guilt-free sex with white men fresh
from pre-Carnival cruises, primitive aerobics
not yet featured on any cable channel
known to man (sic). Remote control syndrome 
hasn't been discovered in fossils or crash pits
and cockpit recorders withhold those final
words we need to believe were heartfelt
and eloquent, the myth of perfect air
travel built into our national narrative.

The city on the hill resists comment
until votes are in, and drug stores
carry captivity narratives for audiences
hungry for biblical certainties, even Job's,
fresh from his trial live on courtroom TV,
brought to you by Hertz, car company with
a heart. Rent an ideal this month and you'll
get free tickets to the Polynesian Cultural
Center where natives aren't native, the chiefs 
unchiefly. It takes a village to presume
their authenticity, accumulation of trends
into truths, driving the economy forward like
Thelma and Louise, gunslingers for the new age.

The Fine Art of Landscape Consumption</b>

<i>Dirty weekends lure the dirty realists.
Potbelly grows the economy for potluck at the end of the rainbow.
"consumption, which is the capturing of the gaze"

consumption of consumptives, willing to power
"the same auratic site"
times 25 million tourists in Waikiki Beach.

Oh say can you be the Sun-God royalty of Elvis in Hanauma Bay
hut: <u>I was the sublime</u>, nationally interpellated
wall-to-wall selves living inside the western-tourist bubble

dwelling in the
industrial slime.  Inequity honed in.
Language drowned on, like traveling Rim poets commissioned

to do special journeys into the wilderness of Lahaina
to emulate the music of whales.  We do
"Worldwide travel agencies, local travel agents,"

Like Wordsworth tanning himself in the Lake District
the 'view' was always a positional good,
scenery-as-a-marker-of-status: poet-God breezing by the picturesque slum.

Repatriated profit: mill literatures recall working mills,
'picturesque cottages' of the potato people, my relatives working in
Brass Valley milltowns,

ghetto tundras.
Come from Hong Kong Newtowns to
savor the last moral Chinatown in America, live exploited workers!

Perform the plantation as special photography spread
for Pacific Rim travelers.
An unsung army of semioticians floods into pink hotels

span out across the neo-Hawaiian landscape of shopping malls
around the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
fan out, medicalized beaches, immunity of primitive porches;

beached-up whales pinkening in the harbor:
Wordsworth tanning his language in the Lake District
Jack London surfs, longing to be a statue of himself 

                                                                  as a Hawaiian.</i>

The Wanderers</b>

Inclement the social weather
and the cultural backdrop
barely palatable, as huge meat diets
taste the local fare as if it were
the process, the fetish
as determined in the mind
and not the passions: where mere
bourgeois functionaries
set documents in order
while nobler selves savage
hypocrisy without awareness,
this is depth as arrogance,
like preserving the tail
of a yellow-bellied skink
they've scared from its
sunning spot, the tapered
nerves flickering like the conscience 
they blot out with righteousness,
sitting on piles of dirty money.
From country to country,
oppressed culture to another,
majority or minority
in the ousted Apocalypse.
We'll have none of that here.
As if one could remove the brain
and still not overcome
the genius {of it all}.  Wander-
ing to something and knowing 
it as imperative
as derivative
as expedient, all in appropriation
the emancipating verisimilitude
of: hey, your abstractions
signifying nothing, soothing
the landed ache as if 
from a seaside (no, greater
yet! THE OCEAN) mansion,
but of course it's fate
and a foil to the Academie!:
who gives a damn
about spelling!
It's like suspicion
or the grumbling gut
that masques as Eraser-
head, the Daddy-power
diminished in the manifested
sperm. It's climatic,
inducing tropical
overtones, the fog
of similitude,
the dusty cradle
of civilization a teasing memory,
possibility? Who said:
"Science
is watching us."?
But then a wanderer
is never a woman
in the language;
lyrically they denied
their way down the oathway,
straight is the gate
so abhorred
it deflects intrusion. Up
North the belly dumpers carry
Dampier salt, the tides
move like nomadic hordes
in visualizations of Scythia.
It's idyllic at Mill Stream.
Once this continent
was connected to India.
Much later there was a landbridge
into Asia. New Guinea
and the North of Queensland
share(d) flora and fauna:
deterministic this singularity
against expansion,
polemic as redshift: they can't
get back now the seasonal
turbulence antiphonises
the clutterings of their palate,
read permanently
in translation
the land itemizes
excursions: like an artist's
diary: it's surprising
when a background 
comes alive
like instigation, rumour
sourcing the point of infinite
malice like displacement theory,
all belonging to the very same
mass of festivity,
like Geryon polluting
(an) other's songs, like panels
set-up to amuse the gentry:
itinerant the learned
and<u> wordly</u>-wise, this
fellowship of wanderers,
serious
and grandiose
in their buffoonery.

For Younger Brother George</i> inspired by my sisters

<b>from <i>Under the Aegis of Practicing English: 
the approaching green series</i></b>

The woman of the dunes swept such a fancy dust
master promoted her to
sweeping pine needles off his roof each autumn
where she discovered her beautiful toes that hurt
when she stepped barefeet on his property.

In the angle of falling sun
within reaches of a dry wind
Kasumi hummed with birds pausing to scold squirrels.
When she noticed paint peeling on the west chamber
she asked master if she could repair the wall just to
continue sweeping the roof
(so she begged) and he let her.

If the villagers happen to amble by they would complain sighing
"ahhhay, look at that Kasumi--in another world." Oh, she
heard but loving pine pierce her blood,
kin to trees seeing the city below:  exquisite.

As she was only a servant, it was her wont to notice
and keep order.  Which is how she became
woman of the apple trees.
First she picked the fallen apples--
gardener was ill and master was at the capitol.
When she would take lunch on the steps by the roses and
	 persimmon trees
recalling her days in the sand; her feet dreamily missing the coarse 
roof, one day her eyes (trained to look downward)

noticed the falling apples.
Crying delicately, she bit her fingers while squatting
to gather the rot.
"Oh my! what perfume" she exclaimed secretly.

After she had piled and packed
the apples partially eaten by squirrels and birds,
apples brown and wet compressed into dirt
dried apples, their bodies outlined like slain warriors
little funny faces contorted like babies just born
among these she discovered a juiciness
like her own mouth which tasted
an ocean she had never seen nor heard except in books.
She Kasumi servant was unconscious in her own delivery.

Which therefore, did not prohibit her from attending
her blossoming.  From the ground the slightly red,
off-yellow scarves high among leaves and pouting green apples
flagged her, and in their uncommon dialect, invited her to join.

Without caution, the maiden's wide feet lifed her
breasts among the ripest.  A knee positioned
in the tree's elbow, her thigh was free.  Which rubbed
this way and that as she reached.
Occasionally, dust powdered her eyes and she stopped.
But soon, her lungs and ears, the tips of her nipples
under the eves of her fingernails
the ridges of her female sides were gummy
with her own wine somewhat salty but eatable. 

The servant Kasumi surprised the tree.
Which boldly clamped her wrists while
chanting its ancient wisdom and anointed her.

a           AY            g
she was moaning
she was being born
she was she reaping her:
sand 
pine
apple

her sap leaked onto the fallen leaves and pleasures in the earth.

Mandalay Fort</b>

		   for Aye Saung

Their fortress walls remind us of the British
their "iron hand," their gentle terror
bathed in holy waters, a river at sunset
wears the setting sun, a saffron sky
inflects a foursquare moat
studded with lotus and colourful police
dozing trishaw drivers folded into their seats.

	We speak, and yes, it's the old master's language
dirty as salvage.
Soap it down with poems, and let your gaze
move outwardly
from exile, from a secret lookout in a forest,
from the hamlet of equality
invisible and persistent in its camouflage,
from a Mahayana meditation platform

	to a Georgian set-square castle,
misty now in the dusk,
cooking fires along its banks, flooded paddy,
parade grounds raked and footprint free
the blackened fruit of Tamarind trees
and betel-nut expectorant
staining the Irrawaddy sand,
flower gardens strummed by brooms
evicting stray seeds of yesterday's news.

Your picture's in it somewhere,
labelled Wanted Man: mugshot of an artist in fatigues.

	Perhaps the Generals foresaw it all:
this goal a five-year plan will make
a college of fine arts perhaps,
or an image bank, staffed
by friendly security guards,
who have eyes for academic landscapes--
river mists, a sunset with a rosy glow
or the petals of a crimson English rose,
Miss Burma 1924.

Rivers of jungle honey, you'd agree
thick enough to sweeten bitter herbs
or thorny mountain trails, where
my mind travels tonight
to a festering hideaway
	where even a bookworm's
classified subversive
brewing secret jungle medicines
learning the art of crushing roots and leaves that still 
	the wound
quicker than morphine.
And you can live with that,
the pain, you can even live
without books, without nation.

	Antique guns guard windows in the trees.
Behind mere lines of least resistance
art's devised for the hell of it:
sings the dark away like a bush guitar
and a journal trains itself
into testament:
the finest English you can muster
and we don't forget.

||  JAZZ NOTE  ||</b>

		"The point must be clear by now: that
		  it is repetition, modified in one way
		  or another, that gives poetry its
		  musical qualities, because repetition
		  is so essential to music itself."
				     --Leonard Bernstein

The trades up, those long cool winds across
the Pacific, as Ramsey Lewis's set starts
here in the Waikiki Shell. Repetition compulsions.
A retarded adult girl in front of me moves 
the seat next to her back and forth, back and
forth, my own repetition compulsions, form in writing
and form in music, even improvisatory free jazz,
requires resolution of sets, of anticipations,
Mailer's story of the man touching the doorknob
again before leaving the house in the morning
to feel the energy later through the metal
on the subway, repetitive
touch compulsion, the spirit in the steel, animism
in the modern world, and then the adult girl 
the woman moves again, moves the seat next to her
back and forth and looks around a bit, maybe
she's not so retarded, not severely, her
movements certainly not fine, not exact 
not apparently appropriate, the seat moving 
back and forth, looking about in particular 
blankness in her face, low affect the docs
call it, a blankness denser than the average
blankness on the average face on any dull
and blank and average day.  Day after impenetrable
day, here just off Waikiki as the trades flare
cool Pacific evening back, hearing
Ramsey Lewis playing pure jazz again

I've lost

am I instantly

where is it? where is it ?
   do I possess

or, propelled by

	    I sit to think ?

Sestina Salutations to Rodrigo Toscano</b>

It is hot Rodrigo.
I think of brick
the sun capturing it like a hero.
I think of oily
the negative version.
Let's go out for lunch.

My favorite meal is lunch.
I'll make you, Rodrigo,
my companion, platonic version.
We'll eat at a chic place called Brick
where the food's not too oily
where the waitstaff have bodies like heroes.

It must be satisfying to be a humble hero
the kind without a Recognition Lunch
the librarian who crawls out of the ground oily
holding a small boy named Rodrigo
who fell through a pile of bricks
during playtime's deadliest version.

On Tutilla Island a version
of cricket is played.  The hero
is the guy built not like a furnace brick
but like something more earthy, more like lunch.
He can bowl like this one Rodrigo
can dance.  For spin he gets the ball oily.

I love when a fabric seems oily,
as silk can in some versions.
A designer named Christian Rodrigo
has a new line called Hero.
If I thought one thing I couldn't eat lunch
not even the mittens the color of brick.

If you were raised around Chicago brick
you'd understand it's a better atmosphere than the oily
fast-food for lunch
no-ethnic-types suburban version
of life spun around sports heroes
of life without the occasional Rodrigo.

Chicago's a city of brick, a version
of architecture not oily but heroic
a good place for lunch with Rodrigo.

Charlie Chaplin</b>

Charlie Chaplin
was in a circus
and got chased up
a pole where the air,
flat

with heat, wrung
all the sweat
out of him, and his gums
shriveled up, and if he smiled
his teeth'd fall out
and hit
the mule
or gorilla, maybe
it was a lion, I remember

there was a lion,
leaning its paws up 
against the pole
and shaking it

so Charlie Chaplin'd fall
down,
like his teeth 
all mixed up
with gravel
and cinders thrown
from the railroad tracks
the elephants

had carried on their backs 
all the way
from China.
Good thing Charlie Chaplin
knew how to squint
or he'd've lost his eyes,
too, like dried snot,
in the burnt up weeds
getting smashed
to dust by the lion's paws.

There were no birds
or clouds
up where Charlie Chaplin was,
but he wore his hat
against them,
and the air, coming toward
dark, had a saw in it,
and his lungs
were soot
and closing down,

which is where he wanted 
to be: down,
with lemonade
on a cool
closed porch, a wall of screens
between him
and a wide green yard.

A lady
with a towel on her head
saw the lion
and scolded it,
and after it licked
her legs 
with its sharp fat tongue,
she folded it up
like it was paper
and crushed it
under her shoe.
Then Charlie Chaplin

came down, and thanked her
by cooking eggs
in his hat.
She ate them off
his handkerchief.

Then horses came
and she rode them
standing up, dressed
in a party favor.
Charlie Chaplin's eyes
got big
as cameras; it was love,
a whole table of it.
But his smile

wasn't loud enough
and she married a man
with an aluminum face
and a long silk cape
who walked on clothesline
looking for fish
to drop in a net
that was hung under him
so he could feed
the trunk full
of monkeys
he kept in his tent.

Charlie Chaplin was the star
of the circus. 
He broke dishes.
It made the clowns so
jealous, one night,
to get even with him,
while he slept
sitting up on a box,

they stole the circus
and all the towns and trees
straight out
to the edge of the sky.
When Charlie Chaplin
woke up,
he was alone, and wherever
he looked, it was flat
and bare.

Angel Films</b>

can anything be too intense for reality? / films about angels / the joining of sunlight and moonlight,
shaping the soul for generosity / poor men with money in their hands / Lancelot & Galahad, the
Best & Purest
	          films about angels / why are they so popular? / it's not because the angels envy us / 
but that there are angels / some days it is warm enough to understand life / some days I
remember the trophies still uncollected from years past / what would they do if I went back for
them? / would I be recognized as the players' player?
						best and fairest / how to explain that I have
returned for acknowledgment / the tribute once paid / the very nice thin glasses we toasted with / 
the caterers wanted five dollars for every one broken / and my Irish grandfather said "If yer not
enjoyin yerself it's yer own ferkin fault"
				      very drunk / no heart to tell him the baby was born with a
frown / and there were waiters and waitresses there who didn't even know we had a baby /
thought the trophy was all / the game what we loved
					                the rules were written in a special ink / ink 
that made you fall in love with the words / so that you memorized them / sung them and repeated
them to other people so they could live lives unwitnessed by the singer / as in the angel films
where things are shared without awareness
					we had to dress the baby up like an angel / when you
are sad the angel may put a hand on your shoulder / happiness leaks through until you have a 
shoulder full of wellbeing / but of course you don't why, you think, gee, my shoulder feels good
today / and the angel slips away
			             it's a job well done / the baby in a long white dress / crocheted /
satin petticoat / embroidery of initials believed from a long way across the sea / "there have only 
been three ever made" / and we know tradition (the endlessness of the moon for metaphors) /
dark lies of the moon shining in her false hood, the night / it's all getting a bit pale and thin
around the edges
		my father insisted that we send proof of the christening we refused to have
										    his
was an accurate hate / he never came to see me win / love that never found its mark / on the night
of the biggest and ugliest trophies he was not there again / and the angels were shy-like animals /
making only small noises as they tripped over chairs / stole after dinner mints
								           the thief backs up
against the world / the same world I spit into my glass / envying people who win prizes and don't 
worry so much that the days keep passing / it's not success but that the days keep passing / and the 
angel passing / searching for the breath of a child / its light disturbance makes the illusion of 
dust
          Saturday morning with the kid dressed in this white get-up / we go down to the Church on the
corner / stained glass windows / pastoral scenes / but the angels are invisible / like they are to people 
on TV / but we can see them / and on the way we brushed the baby's head against a
wattle tree / golden pollen rests upon the crown like angel-dust / I smell
								 It is true what they say
about the smell of babies' heads / nuzzling and wonderful / as if my nose has been touched by an
angel
            Smiling / as we video the child in front of the church / fake christening / fish in the aisles / at
home / I put the trophy away / where I cannot see it
						to satisfy my father we'll post this film all the
way to another country / where people still believe in angels / this angel film of a ceremony
										    as real
as angels / where he cannot see it

Marsden Hartley's Gloves</b>

let's pan for gold,  blow off steam,  rub
a glass rod with silk
& make some electricity

dance on the head of a pin.  Prose is all cartilage
poetry a fin.  Like as the waves
make toward the pebbled shore,  so do our minutes
hasten to their end,  each changing place

with that which goes before.  The old myth
of artistic purity has many active volcanoes
constantly boiling into discourse.  There is a touch
of cruelty in wax,  & a poem requires a meaning
that has to be dealt with on its own terms,  like a paperweight

enclosing a suspension bridge,  or the big orange drum
of a cement truck going round
& round.  The robustness of candor,  the abraded vigor

of Marsden Hartley's gloves
& garden shears,  all those tough,  vivacious browns
inventing an emotion,  a way to be in the world
like Mary Tyler Moore.  A metaphor is made of shadows

like anyone else,  even Sardinia
rendered in color several centimeters thick.  Beauty
requires a large subjective framework
incidental as a grocery receipt
revealing a pair of breasts in a lacy black bra
To be a fool
is to bend time
& space

while enjoying breakfast in a sumptuous robe
of probability

Try picturing a cat
attached to Egypt
Cultures intermingle
& the mouth is a laboratory for testing words,  a pair of dice

tossed on the dark
mahogany of a Montana bar.  There is the music of the toolbox
& the music of the loin.  The music of the mundane
& musk-ox & salt.  But a glove,  a true glove

should fit the hand like the dark
in a radio,  like the glitter
of stars bleeding through the turquoise of a Mediterranean dusk
Nothing beats a good pair of gloves,  & a pair of worn brown 
	chafed
gloves is glossary of new & familiar sensations,  a blend of the
	known
& the unknown.  The slide of content into the fingers of form
& the expansion of form by the wriggle of foraging fingers

II.   Ways of Saying</b>
<i>	from Astronomy</i>

"One" is not only, can produce numerous
Images. To be more exact owing to the lack of space
And ecstatically prolonged by time. Can only see
One aspect of "one." Have met only once, then
On the two sides of one, grows "two," like two maids of honor
With different figures, one in front one behind following the 
	empty throne. In fact
In front: in front there is also the disappearing point of "one"
All is like this when segregated by creations.
But it only lies
In unreasonable visual mistakes.  "One"
this "one" dark and capricious, in "two" and "three," it becomes white
("Three": two white "one"'s.)
The rest of life, it is a label and a banner
The "one" that we see, is only a substitute
As testimony, it is in "two," and "three"
It throws amid us the corpses of two and three
While white--the spirit of one is endless
When called upon, in solitary hours one sees its shadow
Like a rib ripped out. The rib of "one"
Is "one." Simplicity changes into substance and in turn
"One," as if there is really someone

It's just like before</b>

walking in a night when snow flutters on the forehead and it's just like before
walking over from a blank page and it's just like before
walking into that invisible field and it's just like before

walking among words, among wheatfields, walking
among discounted shoes, walking up to words
seeing home, that moment, and it's just like before

straightening western clothes in the wheatfield, and it's just like before
kneeling on kneecaps cast from a gold shield, and it's just like before
this world's most resounding, most resounding

	just like before, just like before is the earth

a time when a ray of autumn light shone between the grass mower's legs, it is
a burst of wild laughter within a stretch of golden corn, is it
a burst of firecrackers spurting out of the scarlet chili patch, it's just like before

No arrangement whatsoever can reproduce its giltedness
Its order is a burst of furious growth in the prairie on an autumn day
It has ubiquitous powers of persuasion, it is just like it was before

A September burst of cold cow dung shoveled into the air and it's just like before
October's stones moved into ranks and it's just like before
November rain passes through a place where you aren't and it's just like before

Just like before seventy pears on the tree smile a crooked smile
Your father just like before is your mother
a fit of coughing in the midst of laughter

The ox's head jolts along the extinguished road
and just like before a whole family rides the ox cart watching the snow 
licked by an enormous ox tongue

	so warm, warm like before

it's snow come from memory, increasing the weight of memory
it's lacking snow, at this time not yet covered by snow
it's that page snow turned over

	turned over, and it's just like before

winter's wheatfields and burial grounds have already joined up
four desolate trees grow right here
light of former days gushes into the narration, beyond discourse fragments

	fragments, and it's just like before

your father turns your mother's death into his sky
turns his death into your mother's tombstone
your father's bones walk down from the high hill

	and it's just like before

each star is experiencing this life and world
each shaft of broken glass buried in the back yard is talking
for a motive that cannot be seen again, says

	it's just like before, it's just like before

from YOU</b>

		for Pat Silliman

		<b>			I</b>

Hard dreams. The moment at which you recognize that your own death lies in wait somewhere 
within your body. A lone ship defines the horizon. The rain is not safe to drink.

In Grozny, in Bihac, the idea of history shudders with each new explosion. The rose lies 
unattended, wild thorns at the edge of a mass grave. Between classes, over strong coffee, young 
men argue the value of a pronoun.

When this you see, remember. Note in a bottle bobs in a cartoon sea. The radio operator's name 
is Sparks.

Hand outlined in paint on a brick wall. Storm turns playground into a swamp. Finally we spot 
the wood duck on the middle lake.

The dashboard of my care like the keyboard of a piano. Toy animals anywhere.

Sun swells in the morning sky.

Man with three pens clipped to the neck of his sweatshirt shuffles from one table to the next, 
seeking distance from the cold January air out the coffee house door, tall styrofoam cup in one 
hand, Of Grammatology  in the other. Outside, a dog is tied to any empty bench, bike chained to 
the No Parking sign.




					   <b>II</b>

Bottom feeders: shadows shift over the floor of the pool. Chairs askew about the square table. 
At one end of the food mall a crowd watches a game of basketball on a giant screen. First I 
imagine what you would look like naked, then as you will look in fifty years. Ball circles the rim, 
then falls, out.

Dressed right for rain, I leap its rivers, carrying an easel in a huge cardboard box.

The bad clown. Freeway shut due to a landslide. Desk littered with preprinted postcards, each 
beginning "Dear Mr. Gingrich...."

What fuel drives the engine of metaphor? Walking around with fists clenched.  Logic of the 
alphabet: bat, cat, fat, hat. Behind the parking lot, the arroyo has become a pulsing, brown, 
swollen rio. A fan-shaped view through the wipers.

Large as a fist, the spider gallops up my leg. New error message. Humpty Dumpty, made of 
cloth, had acquired hands and feet.

Footrub that's only a footrub. 1-900-Yo-Poets. Lone man pushing a shopping cart at four in the 
morning.

Endangered species live on in greeting cards. Boy declares toy stove is a rocket ship. Who owns 
the genomes of tropical plants?



<b>					III</b>

High up in the tallest branches of the alphabet, bare in the hard rain, one small hummingbird 
hovers, wings translucent with the still motion of flight.

Who left the telephone in the oven?

Banana peel has 'corners,' but the meat is round. Blimp that glows in the dark. Purple dog with 
a blue nose. Worms in the compost of history.

Balloons blow across the tundra. The hand as a machine demonstrates closure (the narrative of 
fingers). A vision of vowels vibrates.

Shopping cart as machine, every inch organized by the homeless man's system of trash bags 
(this one for aluminum, that for glass, plastic containers arranged on the rack by size), a cluster 
convened at the Foster Freeze parking lot, two men and woman, high overhead the first full 
moon of the new year.

Shadow of a boy in the dark demands, "Change my diaper." The name who named Liberty 
Valence. Broom in the corner exists as potential. An arrow adds to edit.

Moon shrunken in the dawn sky behind the last gauze of rain cloud. Balloon effect of fat man in 
turtle-neck shirt. I should speak.

Review of <i>Erratum/Frame(d)</i>,  by John Kinsella.
Folio/Fremantle Arts Centre Press, P.O. Box 320, 193 South
Terrace, South Fremantle, Western Australia, 102 pages.</b>

	John Kinsella's poetry provides an excellent example of what I've elsewhere called post-
language poetry.  Kinsella has clearly absorbed a wide range of complex, theoretically-based 
contemporary poetry (The New British Poetry, North American L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, 
similar movements in New Zealand and Kinsella's own Australia).  Yet he brings those 
theoretically-based insights to a variety of poetic traditions, some of which have been often 
considered not useful for experimental poetry.  For Kinsella, form in poetry becomes a matter of 
situation.  His choice of a traditional or experimental form seems based less on the sort of 
cultural necessity that the language poets, for instance, often claimed for their own poetry, than 
it does on a flexibility of perception that recognizes that formal choices can emerge from the free 
play of an author's relation to the world.
	Erratum/Frame(d), Kinsella's sixth book, represents that part of Kinsella's work that 
looks most like language poetry.  As with a number of other post-language writers, however, 
once cannot generalize on the basis of one book about what kind of writer Kinsella is, or about 
the nature of his poetic "voice."  In her introduction to the book, Lyn Hejinian claims that in 
Erratum/Frame(d), Kinsella chooses more "experimental" forms because his subject matter is the 
present and what can be known of it.  Yet Hejinian's insight has more to do with a conventional 
distinction between "traditional" and "experimental" forms than it does with Kinsella's more 
far-reaching displacement of that opposition.  In Kinsella's poetry, it is precisely any settled 
difference betwee "traditional" and "experimental" that has collapsed.  All poetic forms have 
become equally available for "experiment" to the extent that they can be tested for new 
soundings, new possibilities for meaning and its loss.
	Erratum/Frame(d) combines the precise (and heavily Marxist) cultural detail of a poet 
like J.H. Prynne with interventions of literary 
theory and self-reflexivity that mark some aspects of language poetry.  At his best, Kinsella 
swirls these influences into sharply delineated and torqued scenarios remarkable for their range 
of knowledge, their rhythmic complexity, and their flexibility of action and reaction.  The poems 
are simultaneously localized and broad in scope, ironic and at times directly humorous.  His 
flexibility of vocabulary and approach stands out particularly well in the book's later poems, 
esepcially the stunning sequences "Tarot" and "Syzygytics," which to my mind are the book's 
highlights.
	However, all the poems in Erratum/Frame(d) are not as successful as those sequences, in 
part because of the complexity of influences Kinsella tries to reconfigure.  At times, Kinsella's 
reconfiguration seems simply to repeat rather than engage his influences.  This shortcoming 
seems most true of the book's directly theoretical and self-reflexive passages.  Passages of 
literary theory or self-reflexivity are not by definition mistakes.  However, the theoretical and 
self-reflexive passages in Erratum/Frame(d) simply seem, like the book's title, too familiar.  This 
problem is highlighted by the way such passages tend to stand out from the more complex 
interactions that the poems elsewhere embody; too many of the poems start with self-
reflexivity, or halt their movement for a moment of overly worn theoretical commentary.
	One could easily make too much of such moments, because most of Erratum/Frame(d) 
combines keen intelligence, vast knowledge, visual structure.  "The architecture of body and 
tomb will vary between species,/whether germ, animal, or alien--it's a fact that rot/obscures 
experimental glass, that a world germ-free is shrouded," Kinsella writes at the end of "Beyond 
W. Eugene's Photographic Essay: 'Life Without Germs.'"  Such a complex intermingling of 
theory and detail defines not only the troubling conditions of contemporary experience, but also 
ironically embodies the difficulties of poetic innovation at the present moment.  That those 
difficulties should occasionally be displayed by a book that mainly shows how they might be 
successfully reconfigured testifies less to any serious failings in Erratum/Frame(d) than it does to 
Kinsella's willingness and ability to get absolutely to the heart of the matter.
