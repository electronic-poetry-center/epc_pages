may your sleep be blessed</B>

		(for Ria & the Afro-German sisterhood)

may your sleep be blessed
with fragrance: ginger blossoms, white, gold
& pink/ in the garden where one day we will
work & play together/ where i will make a bed
of rainbow petals for your back, & a pillow
of blue cloud for your head, may your sleep
be blessed/ with the shade of mango & coconut
leaves/ where i will hold you & watch/ over your dreaming.
may your sleep be blessed/ with birds nesting in tall
trees/ their naked, spindly arms flung out/ in
wintry benediction/ over all spirits at rest on
welfenstrasse, in gesing, in heidhausen/ in
muenchen, in deutschland, in europa, where
you lie down with your brave heart this night.

may the sleep of our sisters be blessed
this night. black daughters/ in the cell block/
in the crazy house/ in the hospital/ on the sidewalk
in the rain/ in the snow/ in the dirt/ in the camp
in the barracks/ on the border/ on the road/ black
sisters/ with your sons/ with your daughters/ with
your fine beauty, the colors of earth & sun & shade/
may your sleep bring strength.

may the sleep of our sisters be blessed
this night. & their children, & their lovers
& their brothers. & their loved ones/ lost
in burning houses/ spirits leaping out
of flames/ into black nights of diamond stars
out of burning rooms where the door stuck
shut, where the window stuck shut, where
bright threads of smoke laced the eyes shut.
may their sleep be blessed/ with cool breezes/ &
streams of clear water dancing over deep forest stone.

may the sleep of our sisters be blessed
this night. warrior sisters/ armed with
broken hearts & spirit medicine/ warrior
sisters/ armed by spirit guardians riding
horses of wind/ warrior sisters/ armed
with shields of ancestor wisdom & street
wisdom/ with mother wisdom/ & baby wisdom,
with girlfriend wisdom & grandma wisdom,
with hip-hop/ be-bop/ & boogie-woogie wisdom
with/ audre lorde, billie holiday & bessie smith
wisdom/ with sojourner truth, rosa parks &
aretha franklin wisdom/ with tap-dancing,
sashaying, wide-hipped, brazen hussy wisdom/ warrior
sisters/ may your sleep be blessed
on this night/ on all nights/ forever
& ever, amen.

G Dedication</B>

to the E.T. question she added the customary
'we're not' and he not
wanting to be misunderstood said
'too easy to recognize in these
new disguises'-where women are
people send apricot
blossoms for the last great eco-
problem of the age: numbers 
never digits always
two not three dimensions

and these the ways men wage their will
so skilled in the duplicate thesis:
went warily in
to the moon rock came
back fat in a truckload of ore-
welts from our belts barely
visible, sung
to the sun's first helium burst

	so should we marry
	my pale dusky darling
	shirk time & not tarry
	my principal starling

	with you is to manage
	with i am to drown
	moon beams the advantage
	to suns gone down

asleep, they healed in their values like good workers will
& saddled up dreams for the taking (bare back primitive)

stars were their signposts, with every last vowel
inscribed in the lag which was their breathing

when the doors of perception swung shut on them
the whorls of Calliope swooped down on them

knotting the charge that rang in the crescent
that was their bodies in the first cell of collusion

ideas of relation
are the first
whack at description
when the eyes
fail

s/he fails
s he rises	
in the gallery's 
divided-light
corridors

the passion
each feels 
has the rough
outer edge of 
repulsion

at each lunge
of the eyelid
outward

Obsessive reservoir ringing changes as dowser & hazel twig twist sharply
over water-way deep patterning flood plain mimicking a subterranean
hot spot in dry southern places damping family & stock & seasons of poise
designated drought or stream riveting bodies of water perennial corpses
diminishing a Pont Neuf flurry of mechanics as the gaudy fountain sprays
fashionable names in-font per vascular fons et origo, georgically gloating
weir a misshapen picaresque fattened on bloodworms scripted on <b>tidal flats</b>
innate down-stream, filaments flexing circularities & principles, beauty-flow
bent theatrical, red perch destroying status quo, changing habitats feeding
arterial pumps as empire drives its barge inwards from the mouth, large-bellied
black swan duping a wader's scurry compressing slurry occupation like
stacks in hyper-spatial flocks; text block on text block opening engravings
from Les Raisons des forces mouvantes: confluence, text & pre-history,
editorials inciting offshore inquiries into Cayman Island companies.

Idly winter
like his flag
silent hand itching to
balance the breathing

Before the chill a yearning left traces
that cannot be wiped clean
purer than the scenery
no need to flounce the mitten

Up and down and brazen
the randomness of dismissal
backseats still warm from last spring
and the panic for untimely rain

Later unexpectedly simple
without the reflecting mirror
he is able to watch himself
standing, outside

a sleeping goldfish

                    flash of  petals
	  off the  surface
                    didn't make a carp, then

                    it was there, white


	I want you to know something
	I'll tell you


						predators;
	it's us with cans of spray,


				You hope you won't hurt people; really
				you hope they won't hurt you.


	Now just roses or a reservoir.  If we could only find the death camp



we'd feel better. I
said "apotheosis" without really knowing
what I meant. Sometimes I'm wrong: like


		     child porn.
		        I learned what a lung was
					from the American Cancer Society's

		county fair display. A spiced
	    geranium, bloodstain
                      on the flag;

Like Water for Ala Wai</b>
-a poem of bodies-

Dark. Japanese Drumming.

Two opaque white pieces of silk hang at one side of the stage. The pieces begin to
billow, rising higher and higher. Finally they reach out over the stage. Blue 
lights flood the cloth.

One person enters carrying a paper boat with a candle. The "boat" floats 
exceedingly slowly about the stage. One by one several other people enter 
carrying paper boats with candles. They move slowly about the space.

Other pieces of cloth reach out across the stage at various heights. Occasionally
a piece flies across the stage, free.

The "boats" slowly pick up pace and begin to swirl in and about each other.

A piece of heavy cloth, dark in color, flops onto the stage. One of the "boats" 
gets tangled in the piece. It creates its own whirlpool of sorts. It stops, as if
stuck. Others are blocked. Slowly, but with increasing speed, there is a jam. The 
"boats" end up pushing against each other caught in the dark cloth, possible the 
blue-white.

One candle goes out. Another "boat" drops. Another tips. It starts another one on 
fire.

The blue light turns to brown. The clothes all drop off and either wilt or fly off 
the stage. As a brownness invades the space, one person drops his/her boat and 
stamps on it. Others follow.

A scream erupts from all the people. To the rhythm of the drumming, the people 
start a stamping dance. The various rhythms come together. The intensity and 
speed pick up, swirling to a frenzied tempo. A big whirlpool of people are 
dancing around in a frenetic Bon dance.

Cloths are picked up and whipped about. The boats are trampled. Pieces of
paper fly onto the stage, eventually taking on recognizable shapes-styrofoam 
cups, boxes, plastic bags, etc. The frenetic dancers rip up the cloths, tossing them 
about the stage.

The screams revert to a call/answer. Bodies are twirling madly about the stage. 
They fall. Slam into each other. Fall. Slam. Fall. The bodies all end up on the 
floor, twisting, flopping, falling lifeless.

Music abruptly ends.

The bodies shake spastically in odd rhythms. Gasping breaths are heard. The 
tempos slow.

The silence is punctuated by a breath or movement only once in a great while. 
The entire stage goes silent. We stare at the bodies, material and mess for a long 
moment.

Those Are Pearls</b>

Those are pearls that were his eyes
Pilar, pillar of her church,
     hair shone with dye, y la Virgén
de Guadalupe
		   Her aureole
smokes, its plastic blisters-
     slugs in lettuce are veined
the same purple-chevrons

     above a gas station peel back,
a blue mantle, calling
     More curaçao, antifreeze spill

in the palm, callus and thorn in
     battery acid leaking into rust

a corroded image: those are pearls
     that were his eyes, her fierce

love that the turistas
     uncover in napkins, pools of oil
on concrete, my love wears silver shoon,

     Pilar dye-streaked and plastic
Guadalupe, both radiant

with la sucre, diabetes, holy blossom
on vegetable skin, perfume, a cut thumb

there is no burial in that northern ground.
The pole star is visible despite the lamps

Sfumato</b>

Anne you are falling in love late in love,
your life dwindling like an image on the ceiling
traced with a smoking candle, now fading-
at night the stars caught in the tree branches-
they were playing the kissing game, she insisted,
so we felt crazy, the heat, our bodies shackled to shock
smelling the brightest perfume, but she said,
Oh, there, the boys, look, and they murmured
alone together-yellow ink on the brown pages,
lemon playing against the pale blue air,
and she passed around my 'show you' heart,
looking and looking, shopping to buy, the one
who mattered smiling with his eyes, not his heart.
'Once my hopes had died nothing mattered, but then,
when had it mattered?' Too much drinking,
a vista sweeping beyond the plain around
the periphery of the bay, he wiped her mouth,
it was from the summertime fun and drinks,
that and the purple ink on the marriage contract.
So they talked, so he fell arse over heels in love,
he thought she was unattainable, but she ate him up,
is that any kind of a future for a grown man?
He flushed warmly and dragged me past a large
store dummy as he whispered his dirty little secrets,
even the slightest indications of domestic intimacy,
the kind of perfume she used in bed, viruses
and lack of sleep from the trip home.
We made money, we found her an innocent job.
Tie the knot properly-I guess you know to do that-
of course I know-but politics soaks in everywhere,
now they were acting serious, one hiding,
one exposing feelings of desolation.
It was the boss who stole from the customers,
she said, and as far as reporting it to the cops,
she was game. Then security code-words
flashed onto the screen-'When I believe
how I believe, what I fucking-well believe-'
is that any way to talk to a superior? It happens 
all the time, but knowing about it is different
from doing something about it-my career,
I noticed the old wine had the same flavour
as the stuff the girl was drinking. It made me sick.
Oh yes, you could say it was kind of her.
He told her, over and over, how to teach others
intellectual games, how to sidestep the moral issues,
how to brush up your magnetism and influence people-
held in his stare she was like a fish, somehow.
A snapshot gentility, decayed from the backing sheet
to the front gloss, and now whenever I look at
my career, it's to wonder how I ever believed all that.

The family masks were excavated

hanging over the city wall without the city

Exaggerated movements

To dig for the wellhead

Rename these streets that have lost their names
carefully braid the hair long dispersed for size

Diptych</b>

shown here in an unfinished state (not beautiful enough):
graphite, lead, funnel, flowers.

What you feel is true:
a sketched-in bodice,
images of isolated gestures against dense grids,
dozens of nylon cords taut over a structure of copper tubing.

As long as the narrative hesitates between choices,
other interpretations are possible: nervous
inner ear configurations, topographical maps,
copper mesh, feathers.

The neckline area is a bright red,
the body a luminous green and white.

This doesn't exclude flowers, fruit, or vegetables cut at the stem,
broken eggshells, a surface onto which milk
has been poured (object of desire)(pulling the weight
of dozens of blurred words: summer storm,
plunge, complete darkness.)

Zoom in on the word "water." The most far-flung, most dangerous words
extend into the swamp and cannot be approached on foot,
but only by rowboat.
The moss conceals bullfrogs, birds, and insects
which are understood to be products
of human memory-moist-
before it began to explicitly call upon narrative,
that other source.

Tell me, then:
this scene of depth and power 6 feet tall and 3 feet thick
hung about 2 feet above the ground
with alternating bands of gray and black, lapping, lapping,
are these emptied and unsteady images various phases of reality?
Are they implicit?
I came here with nothing in mind

and was kissed
and I am going to sleep tonight, early,
my inward heart
(this would explain)
placed at eye level,
a web of baffling connections appealing to the landscape
not as an index of identity but as sheer material

locked for a long time alone in a bathroom

coated with powdered blue pigment

punctuated by literal depth,
elements of which spill out onto the floor.

The narrative runs between unpainted borders,
a landscape of profusion laden with words,
some of which have dropped to the ground (disintegrating
flowers) (eventually feels so nutty and dizzying
that it's all right to simply let it pass)
through which can be seen female figures hung from the ceiling,
hoop skirts of copper tubing perpendicular to the wall
and projecting like so many open doors alternating vertical bands
of yes and no, each side
a mirror image of the other,
opposite point of view without interruption,
containing repetitions of forms (that evoke) dwellings of the imaginations

		ELEMENTS OF STILLNESS [PINE TREES][SNOW]
		REALLY STARTED TO MATTER TO ME

		I AM A PIECE OF NATURE
EMBEDDED WITH SMALL OBJECTS, OR MOLDS OF SUCH OBJECTS,
		WEDDING GOWNS, CHARCOAL LINES,
		MELTING SNOW

		JUST THE INANIMATE DEBRIS

		TEARS THE WORLD APART AND LAYS IT
		BACK TOGETHER

resembling chunks of raw meat or bodily organs
or a document
or the dream of a white room
with a big window affixed to the human interior
in long, narrow strips of text: a large drainage grate,
or a stairway characterized by mixtures,
where one thing slips over another-

When the voice speaks, I listen to the voice. I am almost too breathless to think.
Are the parts related to each other, folded arms and crossed legs,
buried stone, long sleeve, hand that encircles the wrist,
rising tide (beyond the ordinary constant)
sensitive to light and touch,
beyond mimic?

I don't know how to present the self.

	it is almost surely a deteriorated poem of some kind
	(broken back)

It is impossible to be in control, and I know
my life is an illusion.

I am no longer interested in a very complicated narrative.

That heart is my heart,
MY DOOR-whose central image is a heart.

Just Before</b>

It lasts nearly as stone.
This light ducking as a discretion
makes way. As if choice. Or
a will to bind without being bought.
Or brought to the forefront of some
incredible yearning, as by the sea.
Outlooking is being. A sudden
stillness shimmering as a kiss. The cliffs
without description. A language.
In here you find the dogs bark
just for the joy. What would 
you become from such wander? The
trees return to words.

Review of Albert Saijos OUTSPEAKS: A RHAPSODY (Honolulu: 
Bamboo Ridge Press, 1996).  199 pages.  $12.00.</b>

	Sometimes I go along looking for something new to read.  I long for it.  I 
was luckily able briefly to satisfy this urge a few months ago when I encountered 
Albert Saijo's OUTSPEAKS: A RHAPSODY.  Saijo is in his 70s, a Nisei, a 
WWII internee and veteran, a comrade of Beat poets, a stoner, and a current 
Volcano, Hawai`i, resident.  (I cant help wondering if Saijos living in a remote 
part of the most isolated landmass has something to do with the freshness of 
this book and I think the answer is yes.)  I picked up his new book (among his 
many pursuits he has written a book on backpacking that is years out of print 
and collaborated with Jack Kerouac and Lew Welch) and I thought I am lucky 
today.

	Saijo clearly and self-consciously places himself in the Blakean and 
Emersonian tradition of transformation.  The book opens with quotations from 
both.  And we get in the poems themselves an emphasis on individuality and 
self-expression.  The pieces read as brief but intense rants on subjects as diverse as 
IS LANGUAGE NECESSARY TO HUMAN EXISTENCE to the GULF WAR to a 
piece dedicated TO IRISH HEROES.  Saijo's claims are simple: I WANT TO 
BEAR WITNESS (17) and MY TEXT IS THE WORLD I LIVE IN (19).  Or more 
interestingly: I WANT TO RHAPSODIZE  BUT I WOULD NOT BE PUT INTO 
ANY LITERARY CATEGORY  I AM AN ANIMAL IN A CAGE & I AM 
BARKING TO BE LET OUT  AS IT HAPPENS MY BARK IS RHAPSODIC (19).  
This desire to rhapsodize in a Cagean awareness that one is not free yet must 
talk as if one isdistinguishes Saijos work.  He approaches things sideways a lot, 
writes things other people dare not think.  Consider this passage from 
ANALGESIA: LAND OF PAIN FREE: LETS TAKE THE BUCKS FROM HIGH 
ENERGY PHYSICS CANCER & CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH ALL THE 
BUCKS WE COUGH UP TO SUPPORT MYTH OF CONTENDING 
NATIONSTATES HITECH AEROSPACE PROJECTS ETC ALL THE EARTH 
DESTROYING PROJECTS THAT GOT US KNEE DEEP IN SHIT EARTHWIDE 
& TURNED WORLD INTO A COMBO PLATE OF BIG MAC COKE FRIES 
WITH SIDE OF SUKIYAKE + 2 SCOOPS RICE & LETS TAKE THESE BUCKS 
TO FUND THE MOST AWESOME CRASH PROGRAM THE WORLD HAS 
EVER SEEN  LETS FORGET THOSE ENDLESS BULLSHIT PROJECTS WEVE 
BEEN FRITTERING OUR TIME & MONEY AWAY ON & ADDRESS PROBLEM 
NUMERO UNO IN HUMAN LIFE  PAIN  THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF 
PAIN BY THE END OF THE CENTURY (23-24).

	But since I am a text fetishist, I can't let this review go by without 
complaining just a little.  Saijo writes a visual poetry of scribble and revelation 
in different colored inks.  There is an interesting reproduction on the cover and 
there are tantalizing black and white glimpses of the visual poems throughout 
the book but the book itself presents word by word translations of these poems.  
Saijo, I want to argue, is a new Blake and his readers deserve an illustrated 
edition.  His manuscript pages are beautiful because they are messy yet 
readable.  But they are also important for they illustrate that the paradox of 
our position as readers in the modern age: if we want to continue thinking about 
the relation between the physicality of the worker and the world, we have no 
choice but to look at what a man who claims I WOULD GO OUT & SMASH 
MACHINERY BUT FOR THE FUTILITY OF ONE MAN AGAINST THE 
WORLD makes (62).  The late twentieth century, with the democratizing 
influence of desktop publishing technology and web design, has claimed to have 
created a lot of new Blakes.  But little of this graphical work presents 
something that refreshes our eye.  In this age, I find myself desperate for signs of 
the humannot to establish a human essentialism or authenticitybut rather to 
explore the ways the human is messy, immediate, and daily in its complexity.  
By celebrating low-tech handwriting in the age of mechanical reproduction, 
Saijo reconnects with these qualities.  Or as he writes, ALL I WANT IS TO KEEP 
SOME TRUE SENSE OF AN ANIMAL UP ON ITS HIND LEGS ON A PLANET 
IN DEEP OUTER SPACE & IF A MACHINE WILL HELP ME I WANT THE 
SMALLEST MACHINE LUREENA MAKES (64-65).

	I have mentioned a Blakean and an Emersonian tradition because it is 
the most obvious throughout the book.  But I dont want to sell this book short as 
uninflected romanticism (or as just more Beat poetry a little later in the game) 
because it reconnects and refigures much.  (It would, for instance, bet interesting 
to compare Saijo's work to work done by language writer Robert Grenier who also 
uses a handwritten scrawl and produces poems that are close visual 
equivalents.)  I find myself wanting to say that OUTSPEAKS is both rooted in 
tradition and totally new; that it is both a product of a solitary genius and of 
someone hooked into communities and culture; that it is written by a Luddite and 
by a progressive visionary; by an anarchist and a socialist.  Saijo is, of course, 
well aware that contradictions like these are the stuff that forms existence.  At 
one point he uses the kolea, a bird that winters in Hawai`i and summers in 
Alaska and Siberia, as a utopic model for dealing with contradictions: ITS 
REPORTED THEY HAVE THIS INTERESTING CUSTOM OF MAINTAINING 
THEIR FORAGING TERRITORIES DURING THE DAY THEN ABANDONING 
THESE TERRITORIES AT NIGHT TO GATHER AND ROOST TOGETHER IN 
FLOCKS  SOME KIND OF ANIMAL CIVILITY HERE  SOME KIND OF 
POLITIC FOR BEING TOGETHER AND ALONE (143).  Contradictions are part 
of the wonderful madness of this book but also are illustrative of the relevance 
of this book which refigures and reinvests the Beat values of dropping out to 
open the mind, of individuality as the basis of an equitable collective culture.  It 
is good to reconsider the world in this manner, with a fresh eye from someone 
who has seen a great deal.
