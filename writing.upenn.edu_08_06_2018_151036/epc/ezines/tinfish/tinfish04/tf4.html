But we have remade the world with our own hands-rediscovering all things, not once imitating anything.		-Michel Seuphor</b>The world was stitched together at noonon Sunday out of old bicycle partsby a mouse with thread of ice and eelskin silk.The first woman said to the first man: "Hola!In a cave not far from here I keep 1000 geese."At sea the pig fell overboard and so arosethe custom of sacrificing the first-born childby casting it at birth into the ring of beehives.Chroniclers began to write it down about the timemajor technological advances were made in the artof navigation. Possibly a heavy protein dietcontributed. The rebels sailed out into the centreof the lake from whence they could be heard hurlingatavistic insults at night, their naked shadowsbig as wind-tossed trees on the torch-lit water.First the world ran out of participants;finally the observers too became extinct.The bare, brown earth and red, crumbling rockswere alive with a carpet of gregarious mice.Mutant eels with fixed grins which displayedtheir sabre teeth infested the remnants of fresh water.Ice descended and froze the ink in pensand saliva in mouths. The image which was evoked was neither the man weeping after the filmbecause he had recognised the impossibility ofever returning to the land depicted on the screennor the piled bodies of the stupid armywho camped in the bush clearing and were shotwhere they shat by volleys of accurate fire,but the dry laundry flapping day after dayin an exhausted air with not a soul at homeleft to take it in and fold it up.				Barcelona, 8/12/96<p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="aitken"></a><font size=4><b>Adam Aitken</b></font><p><b>The Astral Traveller's Guide to Alice Springs</b>As if the town has lost its sight to cataracts, the cold gravelthe ghost gums. The air's too pure to create clouds, or the simpler structuresof human kindness. Brown hawks carve the air, ground zeroover football fields, sprinklers fan out into rainbowed mists.It's a place where dogs chase rocks and stalk mountains,for gazing at stars, so many stars seen by so few.We leave our signature in the sky, before we descend, guided by the star fireof dead ancestors. There's work to do, finding out what it was exactly, modifying our accents, and sounding outthe brittle earth, test the exact composition of gases, life-supporting in proportion to life-threatening.We gauge in the driest creeks and in the flesh of thinnest cowsthe hazardous nature of propagating a new race of ourselves,even in the form of trees modified by nitrogen overload,or as other organisms that meet a sympathetic balancewith the native inhabitants.As gentle as befits our cosmic nature, we sprinkle the dirty ice we areamong these pilgrims in a shopping mall, all wearingT-shirts of rocks: central landmarks we have usedto navigate our countless passes of this continent.We follow them-discreetly as scientists-to their placeof nourishment-a watering hole of complexanthropological interest. Here the spirit of the tribeis ennobled-not by mere trinkets-but by the wrought iron runesof a crueller script they call Branding Irons, a typefacesignifying ownership of their four-legged herds. It is clear we havestumbled on empires of meat, and this its temple, and thesetheir custodians and their icons: photo-chemical representationsof shelter, ideal scenes of water, moments of harvest, a muster of beastsby elegant hovering vehicles they call helicopters.	Might this be the place to declare ourselvesa delegation from Halley's comet, but too shattering an interruptionto their industry, and our accents as yet too strange.	We return, puzzled that our prophesiespredicted so little of this, so little written but with this new knowledgewe see our home for what it is: magnesium and icenever seen before or ever imagined, in orbit round the sun.<p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="brown"></a><blockquote><font

Mezzanine</b>Fumbling in a vein glassy with its transit,the story will not begin, the story will not die.Repeating the world like water,events begin their nervous arrival.Now we have cognition no nicety can kill.The mother theory swells along the neuron range.The social anvil rings.    Money as love,love as greed,     greed as a kind of fate.When the god of dirt's transparent,the stealthy world's in flood.  World of utter words.In the summer of that idea, passionate excess,bruised with attention, breaks.   Large menare seen walking, embarrassed by their size.At the bottom of human nature, something beaten stirs.Instead of desire, a brown tree and a blue,marge of snow at the garden verge, and the new dark age.We sit in the excavation between silenceand white noise, where the blank weight of existencethickens but will not shine.

Like Cicciolinabeing the model for everythingin the glossy magazine apartmentsof <i>meta-kitsch.</i> Or Elle Macphersonsaying you should only readwhat you've written yourself.Or Christo hiding dead artbeneath swathes of wrapping.On the Island of DoctorMoreau the animal-humans animate analogies & moralizeas we take our medicine.Taking the cure meansmaking it suffer. Metaphoris the only way of saying somethingplain & simple & as we turn full circletowards Babel Fowler becomes a kind oftrendy gibberish. InGiacomo Balla's<i>Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash</i>_we_ notice the energyof a still in which Balla delights in the simultaneityof deprivation. Innovationis the fraudulent usage of an establishedmethod of discussionon the nature of intent& inspirationonly because there's a market.We might still be drawn to expressionwithout a means of exchangebut it's unlikely we'd be pushedto validate it. But that'sin a perfect world where your indulgencewouldn't bother anyone a damn.That if you didn't work you'd starvealong. A doctor tells the storyof a suicide who survived just long enough to fully comprehendthe totality of pain.  He'd drunk toilet cleaner& then changed his mind.Like the late twentieth century.There's no need to refer to particularincidents to make _this_ a political poem.I can analogize by using the Islandof Doctor Moreau & prompting the readerto consider the tyrannies of science,which is a euphemismfor. _The Law Giver is dead_.The Ipecacuanha like a UFO fixation.In the House of Pain Moreau said: "Youforget all that a skilled vivisectorcan do with living things."Here, if you wishfor an absolute kind of illuminationyou must of courseread the book. I have read the book.A lot of my friends are writers.Many are venerated by their peers& would be considered to have good tastein things literary. I write a poem & hand it around.Some praise it as the best thing I've written,others suggest I return to the draft-board,others that I scrap it & take a rest.I consider that <i>the best thingyou've written </i> might not mean muchif deep down they think that the rest of your stuff is pretty lousy.Even their judgementshave different meaningsdepending on how they tell me & how I listen.Style doesn't change, but styles do.I once led into a poem with a quotefrom Brodsky: "Everything has its limit,including sorrow." I read the poem. It's titled"Trans-celluloid Vision". I consider whythe quote is used? The poem is in threeparts and the last stanza reads: "Everything has its limit-the train slowing, the journeyalmost complete. Reliefborders on sorrow.I lose track of the plot,embracing the platform." In the _light_of the rest of the poem this is a little "tacked on".It is a poem about a fragmenting relationship;a kind of lament.But this doesn't really come throughso it can't _really_  be about that.	I haven't guided the reader.through italicizing "can't"to make my intention clear(er).My problems continue(d)with a second reading& I suggest(ed)it's another of those I gave up on but wasn't ableto get rid of.Years later & I'm at it again.The first line of section 1 (View from a train)reads "The curve of the track / betrays the engine."I remember the train going from Sydney to Melbourne.That the  _mystery of movement_  was lost whenthe engine appeared out of the window. I think it wasraining & the atmosphere was "surreal". But thisis not my word, it comes from somewhere else.The poem continues: "Moisturetrapped within the double-paned windowmakes liars of manufacturers claiming air-tight security. I stare past the frameof lacquered wood & outside the dayis cinematographic. Flickeringfrom reel to reel until the creditsshow the names of logging & catering companies,trucking & management industries."The second stanza turns against the first:"A green desert. Sheep moving slowlythrough viscous paddocks, water poolinglike blood. Dry country strandedon the backbone of grey granite.A washed sunset emphasizesthe sharp teeth of a retreating city."I recall being dissatisfied with the "washedsunset"-maybe "brooding" or "harsh"or some other more active adjective?But it was the bitterness of sorrow that intrigued & this disparateimage stuck. In the dissectionof the corpse of this poemI recall Lyn Hejiniantelling me how she'd gone to watchautopsies with Mike Patton,the lead singer of <i>Faith No More.</i>I wouldn't have mentioned Mike but his musichas always interested me & if he hadn't beenon world tour I'd have tried to solicitmaterial for the literary journal I edit.Lyn saidthat in this de-sensitized environment(actually that's my word, I can't rememberwhat she said specifically but its effecton me was to suggest this) the bodywasn't that frightening.I think she held a liver.I asked if it was like a collection of artefactsbeing removed carefully from a tomb.I think she laughed.But it might not havebeen a comfortable laugh. The second sectionof my poem is entitled: "The Cat& The Canary or The Absence Of SorrowAccompanying A Belated ReadingOf The Millionaire's Will: A ReconstructionTo Help Pass The Time" So, it's _sorrow_by association. In _true_post-modern spiritI digress into commentary on a 1927 b & whorror film. Somewhere in there there'sthe influence of Tranter. I'm tossing up whether to "background" this piece.No, I'll quote it in full & then elaborate,simply noting that the long linesdo not best capture the short subtitlesthat accompany silent movies but _do_ suggestthe notion of linear narrative. Maybeas you read the long-lined versionyou can also visualize how it wouldlook were it segmented, chopped up:"The late night silent classic for the real buffs.Shot in '27. The director died two years laterOf blood poisoning. The screen throws a double image,The UHF aerial failing, or the ghost of the directorFermenting 'in-camera' with age. He has the castLip-synching their way through a readingOf an eccentric millionaire's will in a houseThat his ghost has occupied for twenty years.There is Mammy Patient, Susan & the famousWest Diamonds, Annabelle, Paul, & The Lawyer.GHOSTS! the portrait falls to the floor.Mammy inks her brow. The willMentions a distant relative & demandsSanity. The lawyer disappears. The murdererClaw-fingered & with nails like razorsIs seen only by Susan, who must PROVEHer sanity! The doctor with peculiar handsArouses suspicion. There's a moth in the safeThough it's not been opened for twenty years!And who hired the imposter asylum warderWho's hunting a madman who tearsHis victims as a cat does a canary?"Strangely, this section stops here.No witty line that might hint at resolution. If the title is considered we mightreflect on the ruthlessnessof the participants.An allegory of the twentieth century.Or of the human condition generally?It's been noted that the last stanzaof the final sectionseems a little "tacked on".But in the light of the second section maybeit's a pretty <i>obvious  </i>conclusion?Part 3 ("Solarization-a celebration") reads:"Sunrise.My mind blank.Spencer Gore's painting<i>The Icknield Way 1912</i>appears stereoscopicon my glasses, or soI'm told. A geometricalmost tabular skyregisters through a filmof brilliant lightas the train celebratesthe approaching city's solarization.The sky inflects& organizes fancy:the landscape bright,explosive, threatensto ignore the script.""Organizes fancy"-_it_ reminds _me_of a review by James Dickeyon John Ashbery's firstcollection of poetry.I can't remember what he said exactlybut he hated the book.I tracked the book down& thought it was great.But then I like Ashbery{'s poetry}.There's something about his use of weirs,I think.I'm reminded of Vasaritalking of Leonardosaying that he could find no living modelfor the features for his head of Christ,so it was best left incomplete. It existed in my filesas a kind of still life,as a piece of dead naturewaiting for clarity,hinting at de-compositon.<p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="huang2"></a><font size=4><b>Yunte Huang</b></font><p>	<b>Tofu Your Life</b>		frame de frame		rule de rule            ______________            | your  life  |            | a  small    |            | square tofu |            ______________		unnegotiable shape		soft to chopstick                     <font size=6>\  \</font>                      <p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="brown2"></a><font size=4><b>Pam Brown</b></font><p><b>In One House    :    Adam Aitken	        A Review</b>reading a set of poems  is easier &         usually           more pleasurablethan talking about one,      about how,          for instance,          adam,  in  his  book,  shiftsbetween realms of identity,  between  the record-     an itinerant childhood-      & , as an adult,                      a reconstitution             the poet's mission,    declared  first off,                 in a quote             from "Art & Lies",is to recover         <i>past,    home   &   place.</i>                     (mission impossible?)the first poem's title:--                <i>_Post-colonial._</i>via various tourisms-        tv airport history-africa leichhardt gilligan's islandcambodia burma uluru thailandenmore saigon surry hills,    from bruce lee to barthes,       james bond, & mr. & mrs. biga kind of analytical   umberto-eco-everywhere                          gone "<i>asian</i>"        finally lands                                      in Bondi& exotica-              monkeys      angkor wat's bats karma tantra      buffalo buddha tiger balm-rendered the quotidian-<i>even the shopkeeper from Saigon spoke Greekto sell his cheeses-</i>                                 the exotic, the "oriental"    charted, examined, lamented        dismissed, embraced--the spectacle is integrated             & it's all on SBS	("_the world is an a-ma-zing place_")the writing-as adam fixes   imagination's artifice    to art               what bob          adamson's blurb calls   john forbes' "hip technique,"naming the influence,  reminds me more of dawebreaking away      from his mentor, forbes,(this poetry's less eccentric)into, for example,     a rhyming formalism-                  in	                _Indochine_<i>She gave birth to fearless boys, who sold the farms,who played chickenon highways for dying on; they'd live againas dashboard tiger charms.</i>                     &	                  _Sailing to Byzantium_<i>Byzantium: east meets west in search of fameStrangers to each other--from a life of actionTo a layer cake of fin de siecle, a corrupted game</i>                 this dark-ish humour                                      doesn't jokeand love?    every poet's gnawed old bone-cool love appears    but the tone is mostly      temperate, serious  & sensual-          <i> Rivers of jungle honey you'd agreethick enough to sweeten bitter herbs</i>so deepened empathy      becomes a protest poem                 _The Bad Women of Bangkok_the cynical excess-             sex without eros-<i>and the girls disguised as monkssmuggle into clublandwhere you canlambada with a snake or smile in a cage of disillusioned crocodiles,or edit their livesand take them back to the hills of their youthriding whatever tiger you choose,and call it a safari.</i>adam edits    life upfront & stretches application         as he calls           his English language home,the referents comfortable at last           in the title poem-<i>but here to stay like a generationtagged on to the last, bemused by the next,some still writingpoems to their friends.</i><p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="schultz"></a><font size=4><b>Susan M.

She was left with a band of contentment over her brow, the one that had throbbed violently in the past, and couldn't know why she was chosen to lose herself in ongoingness: the present belongs to those who relinquish desire as a good against absence or the threat it leaves like a homeless man's mattress at the door; he doesn't threaten you, but his circumstance does, so you retreat into the sanctity of your castle, sacred if only because it stops the drafts from disrobing your security zone.  So contentment is always at the mercy of the next plunge in stocks (at best) or thermometers (at most contingent).  The invitation obviously false, you arrive late to find the company banded like endangered birds (not those of prey but other more delicate ones whose beaks can't reach into most flowers for their rudimentary nectars), conceived in discourse and bounded by it, as I am bounded by these narrower than usual margins.  The culture shock eased a bit, white people seeming more or less inevitable in every circumstance, and so did the reflex anger that greeted her first public exposures to the old rules.  Yet the purpose is to conjoin elements, allow them their clash, then recuperate whatever's left as sediment for the newer dispensation, the one that promises to arrive like express mail, a day or two later than promised.  The local is real, as my students remind me, white woman shuttling unpredictably in and out of her symbolic value, the duck/rabbit example hardly an instance of autobiographical excess.  Fluttering like a lid or nervous astronaut in front of a zoom lens, space between him and more space, you recoup your losses as evidence there was a gain, embarrassed knowledge taken like a fortress, or the ego's precarious pylon on the far cliff, ropes in arrears as usual.  Guilt greets you less as fact than as necessary outback to operate through, though your ancestors did not, & etc.  Intellect is molasses compared to historical necessity arbitrated by oppression's stern rehearsals history's over for you guys, but not for us.  The phone rang and you neglected it, hoping instead for more direct speech, the blood knowledge that the wanderer set his chips on.  Plantations run by such as you, "discovery" made by such as you, evidence that agency sells disaster and an outsider referring to "the rape of the land" is a fool even for noticing it.  Metaphor as defense or irony, and I love them both, don't do it when communication occurs on the head of a pin and there's no time for prettiness (considered with or without its "r").  Old judges told tales predicated on outside value; the newer ones start from a siege and then take the shelter of their sufficient arguments for enclosure, which later bites them as an instance of bourgeois power realignments.  The gap is there to slip through, so take up your pen and write (if not here, oh crucial"if") a measured dialogue with other selves, even where the landscape falls away and all you see is ruin around the billboard advertising your front yard as paradise, lest you prick the bubble to which you signed a loyalty oath.  I wouldn't cheer for that if I were you.<pre><p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="glazier"></a><font size=4><b>Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier</b></font><p><b>Kyushu</b>And words to match.

I've seen such descriptive terms--take the video on fly fishing. O'er the sounds on its crests that prate then plaster. Without benefit of lights nor shaving hot water. A baleful black oyster.

irrevocably lost, holding an apple. She used to stamp her boots to crow songs, raise athigh-high dust in honor of their impermeable music. The callusedballs of her feet engaged in the residue of dance, a fox trot or cha-cha. Her legs threatening a disco split in the early morning frost. Tokeep her questions alive she carved them in stone, laid them besidethe roadways, believing that miracles could play themselves out, oneway or another before a new dust would blow it all away. To keepher weight among the epitaphs, it was said she converted apples intohands and hands into thin letters, that once unsealed provoked riotsin far away cities, caused household pets to come together in one simultaneous scream. When she was young, she would kneel for thefountain coins of luck, taking back the wishes. She thought howstationary one must be when our history gives into an undeniableabsence, when an arm suddenly vanishes without appeal. How stillto divide the waters.

They are so quiet and practiced they have never been caught. At the end of the seventh grade one of the girls is distracted and bored with the game, but plays anyway, sloppily marking the binder paper with lines where the letters will go, while looking around the study hall in the hope that a particular boy is watching her. She smiles at the boy and crosses her legs so that her skirt rises to reveal her thighs. Each time her friend guesses a letter, the figure of the hanged man receives another embellishment. Finally the stick figure is complete and the girl writes: <i>you lose,</i>displaying the word her friend was supposed to deduce. <i>But you misspelled it!</i>, her friend shouts, causing the teacher to rush over and make black marks next to their names in her book.         One of the girls spends the summer on the other coast, and that fall they encounter each other on the first day of school. Over the summer the girl who drew the hangman developed breasts, while her friend got acne. The former girl walks past her friend and joins a group of eighth grade females who also have breasts, who are also wearing dresses and makeup. They form a tight cluster next to the lockers, talk and laugh among themselves. Instinctively the other girl goes toward some students she has known since the fourth grade, girls who are either pre-pubescent, wear braces, glasses, or have imperfect skin.     Although they know they are too old for it these girls go to the playground, swing from the monkey bars, or rock up and down on see-saws. Bored with this, they drag their shoes through the coarse sand.

Part of everything finally.	When I was young my mother had warned me that men could come by, breathing closely, in their cars, looking out to steal girls.  Torture them.  Rape them.  Throw their bodies into faraway gulches.  I didn't hear her then.	Who I have become is no longer bait for such men.  But I hear her, her quiet voice, her cold watery questions.  I feel my body blend into another crowd that gathers around the concrete bench.  When the bus arrives, they shuffle move to get on except for a dwarfish lady.  We are alone for a while.  I memorize the pattern of the material of her dress.  Then she leaves without our having looked at each other's faces.  Two invisibles.  	Late in the afternoon here comes a bunch of school kids from Ka'ahumanu School with teachers holding traffic cones at the front end and in the back guarding them.  Precious cargo moving through dangerous streets where anything could happen.  Past me, all of them.  They insert themselves into my vision, marching full of explosive noises and color.  In the middle of the parade a boy with an orange t-shirt wears a traffic cone on his head.  Of course he feels different and alone in his costume.  It shows in his looking around.  I know this.  His head is small enough to fit inside the cone as if a helmet had been made just for him to look like a walking crayon. 	A clown.	His serious dark eyes meet mine.  He is surprised, but not too much, because only he sees that I am here and he knows the others don't mark me.	I put my finger slowly to my lips so that he doesn't startle.	He shrugs his shoulders, and he doesn't call the others.	Then the clown is gone.  But I can hear the warm, splatter of words and sounds, the lighthearted footsteps receding for a long time.	Bicyclists in helmets and those pants like black plastic now and not one of them looks this way.	The sunset that comes on is huge, red and takes its time.	At nightfall I move on like a cloud away from the headlights.  Slow, wet with no tears--no regrets, thanks, anyway--and a quick rainshower, I leave a trail of broken things in my wake.  Bits of Kleenex, unspooled tape strands, toilet paper underfoot, crushed tickets, torn up money, grubby pennies, puka panties, useable cardboard, my old address on a crumbled note, self pity, twisted scatter pins, a good zori, the unused supermarket cart, last night's newspaper bed, the one sweater with a button, directions from my empty pill bottle and the snapshot that was left.  All I got now is their faces.  A few of their voices in my head.  That's about it, honey.  I say that.  Loud so it feels good and fades until nothing's there from me, all gone.<p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="harmon"></a><font size=4><b>Joshua Harmon </b></font><p><b>New Orthography</b>Entre's extract twoo strict annverse unversed strickin nether universal co cau ady spent a drawe, forgo nedles given t groudn,-cover,-less, new orthophony nede to examine times staffd sheets or lves not synchronous installed aboue, erly tha mourn yet im under plus-ground,-water, dug up, -foot and appraeciated wll wool her will pure genius of cous in crisis or crisscross a folklore [illegible] swg veto enclose't sums time soon vote too hard to give it up to say it say simulate at thesame time stimulate.<p><a href="tf4.html#top"><img src="toc.gif" border=0></a><hr><p><a name="smith"></a><font size=4><b>Hazel Smith </b></font><p><b>Perguiltspek</b>From <i>Walking the Faultlines</i>  a hypermedia, installation piece. shunder urtli stroqua agalan stroqualan ault? tauf intervirt? qual anapex?brekem omaguis woance ferguisling, sepho spyrou valpe baterou. brekenoch phaton phora isginoic ault. olo woance plakinvo rebse lansnot.shunder brekwa rohor antergat voper. intervit oiter babetrou acen bowa plakinvo. wofor? veltrans? eclovo? acen isplenus phaton. brekwa rouks belbalo. acen plape phatapex, acen sinin spinispek. oiter inglingance acen rebse breke inguilor. babetrou oiter woance olo isginoic! brekenoch brekwa rapho calwo eclovo! shunder inglingance urtli inguilmor phora spepho? rants sinin cultimur. roucks sinin cintevep. rohor leslex laslo isginoic. spinispek wadora brekenoch intervirt plakinvo. shunder stroqua cultimur calemwo. brekwa acspe inglin. brakwa plapwa tulariv, brekwa phaton ferguisling inglingance. intervit plakinvo inguilor shunder brekem plakinvo isginoic. <b>Poetics</b>she spat out her past at the speed of light the quest for language unborn and buried the route is never the same rule twice a man cracking the egg of the textshe found herself born into endless caressing  dead authors swimming in their own semen the site where the phallus hovers and shufflesa light dissembling into silence a breath which blurs the edge of the mirror a woman and man slowly undressing the earth unsettled the earth unsigned a pathway at the squirt of a button    metaphors loosening at the joints trains at the crossroads of dying and living a woman tearing the bread of being a woman tonguing the wine of syntaxone voice disembowelling another a woman defecating dead reasona worry taking the route of a wish a longing that springs from mental re-jigging  a world at the edges of spilling and spinning  a word begetting ancient beginnings a piece taking the part of the whole the tune that makes the bow play the fiddle a wish to make a jigsaw of space the end is always in the incision  a box containing festering riddles <b>Monologue</b>You know I've always wanted to write a stream of consciousness piece in reverse. And I've always wanted to perform my life as if I believed in my actions. The whole thing is in fragments which you sew together. I've been permanently in exile spitting out and sucking in my past. You keep saying the same thing and it becomes something else. The trouble is people don't like my voice, they say it's too loud, too masculine, too aggressive, too soft, too feminine: the list never stops. But you mustn't let fate be your physician. Because everything is terribly odd and it's all a case of getting even. They said you're parading in the nude, but I said I'm just knocking the socks off language-it's a will without an agenda. At the same time at the centre of everything is this terrible fear I have, that by thinking about death I might cause it. I stand with my back to the mirror and keep turning my head. All I can see is England replete with redundant meanings. I've realised that I feel at home in cyberspace because I have no sense of direction. I like the routes without rooms. When I started to read Freud I couldn't believe how much he and I had in common. Yet a text has to go somewhere occasionally or drop off at a likely destination. It's keeping your eye on the timetable which counts. Inspiration is a lie but anything can trigger it. For example, I like the flowers Suu Kyi wears in her hair, don't you, a reminder that somewhere she has another life and exists in a different way, even if she's forgotten. I often think I'm only a photocopy, or a ghost on the faultlines. It's not chic to write about love so you have to kill it or bend it double. But I like to resurrect the text with my voice. You keep walking without feeling you've ever arrived, and when you do it's never the place you intended. Then his eyes appear in close up. His mouth loosening at the corners, themost seductive smile. It's romance, it helps you to forget. After that it's all corridors and low ceilings. Pol Pot and Hitler, not to speak of Stalin. You have to be on the alert like a bird sleeping with one eye open. It may be best to speak a language no-one understands. At the very best translation is always desecration. There's always this wish to master the text, but you have to break the rules to know them. And you have to stand your ground. Round about you everyone is pushing buttons and reproducing themselves. It's all emotional hide and seek. I remember my aunt baring her breast: I'm still afraid of catching her cancer. There were a lot of hidden things, and also whispered words I couldn't understand. My father's name carved upon a tombstone. But cemeteries are cities where they keep the dead. I don't want to go sightseeing because I might get caught in the traffic. I'd rather swerve between channels and eat books: text in the hole, soupe à la situation. It's good the way you are beginning to see things <i>my </i>way, just as I am beginning to catch up with your way of thinking.  But however clearly you think things out, there is always someone crying in the next room. Which is hardly surprising because, on the whole, men can't tell the penis from the phallus and I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference myself if I didn't write. Why do you think I'm telling you all this? Well, you can't live to rule but you can light a room by blowing out the candles. The more peculiarly I write the more infectious the aroma. I like to speak, but generally when I do I'm sorry. I learned Hebrew as a child but I could only read, I couldn't understand a thing. I'm no good at crossword puzzles, keep imploding in the mirror. Yet, they say, there's no such thing as a word which doesn't strike a light. I'd like to be myself but I hardly ever am because I don't exist. They painted letters on me, but in the rain they washed away. And monologues can be boring. Still, it's good to wipe the screen and clear the decks. Dead lovers in Bosnia, the murdered at Port Arthur. And the almost over-leaning tower of Pisa. A sign that nothing stays as it seems. And no-one gives a damn whichever sex I'm choosing.<a name="contrib"></a><p><hr noshade size=5><p></pre><font size=5><b>Contributors' Notes</b></font><p><b>Kapulani</b> lives in Pu'ahu'ula on Oahu <b>&#149;  Murray Edmond </b>is a Lecturer in Drama at the University of Auckland.
