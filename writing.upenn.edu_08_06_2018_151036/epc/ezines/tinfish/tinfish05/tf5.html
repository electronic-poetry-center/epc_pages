			               "There's a place where there is no race-black or white-
				there is no gender-male or female-
				there is no age-old or young.
				There are only people.
				It's called the <u>Internet.</u>"     - MCI TV ad, 1997

			tappa tappa tap:
			deep in my night, Pacific time,
			and his East-Coast dawn,
francisco's fingers fly on,
landscaping a scene. he means
to torch and moisten me:
				in a stony lakeside estate,
				i'm secured
				by scarlet silk handkerchiefs
				to a four-poster bed,
	my slender, nut-brown frame
	stretched out like a lizard's
	my coarse, jet-black hair
	spanning the sheets
	like an "Oriental" fan
as he trails a peacock feather, iridescent,
over my reddened lips,
which gleam in the flicker
of yellowing candles.
							and i don't know how to tell
							this miserably married
							middle-aged professional
							Catholic Italian
							Jersey suburbanoid
						                 who makes missiles for a living
						that not all Asian girls
						from Hawai'i
						are bikini'd,
						or thin,
						or tanned,
					or give a shit about
					his Suzy Wong fantasies
					of gently giving, all-forgiving,
					long-tressed, slant-eyed exotics-
				or wanna do anything
						but get off,
							log off,
							       leave the sweaty keyboard,
							       and fall into tossed dreams.
i turn the fantasy:
cut my bonds with a ninja's knife
(which i've tucked 'neath my chinagirl dress),
catch his head in a judo lock, tie him down,
spit on my blade's bamboo case, prepping it
to fuck his pale-as-port virgin ass-
so much for eurasian romance.

	he hisses, you bitch,
	you're really sick
	then scurries from the chatroom like a scared gecko.

			well after midnight,
			you'll hear laughter from my room-
			i can't explain how sane,
			how strong this makes me.
						           another cyber-eve,
						           sir valjean pouts
						           when i proclaim
						           he's too youthful;
						           i only sleep with men over thirty,
						           even virtually.
						he's very mature, he whines;
						true, just twenty-two,
						but teaches marine biology
						at a local Arizona C.C.,
						works toward a lit. Ph.D.,
						sports a black belt in
						aikijutsu, breaks 17 bricks
						in one fierce swoop-
					geezus! where do they teach
					these boys to crow so?
					he might as well whip it out
					and measure it for me.
how do i say 
day in and out
i meet smartass brats of all ages
in the academy, crafting long CVs
puffing up like balloonfish on steam-
all whipping it out, sizing,
all still boys.						at least he's chivalrous
							in a medieval sorta way;
							sweet lady, i'll meet thee
							at the grand canyon
							renaissance faire-
							he's a knight in the s.c.a.*
(*the society for creative anachronism, a european middle-ages cultural revival 
organization)
				his guild will draft me
				a custom-sized, silver chainmail dress--
				historically authentic
				and non-chafing besides.
					they'll do it in an hour flat!
					it'll make me look festive
					at the bonfire bellydance.
i'm drawn like a druid to
ceremony,
but balk after
our two-hour chat on
pagan beliefs:
		he knows too much
		about anton la vey*		(**author of The Satannic Bible)
		and aleister crowley***                (***early 20th century British warlock)
			recites like prayers
			lives of lone prodigies
			who ranged the backroads, palely
			shaping unmarked graves
			from mere rivers and toolsheds.
				now the guild seems like a coven;
				perhaps the fire has five points!
he makes me recall
another brilliant man
who left me red and blue,
gripped by 
the passionate conviction
he was the vampire lestat.
				i'm glad you're exploring
				your european roots, kiddo . . .
							too bad they ended up
							in transylvania.
			a flick of the wrist, and my mouse
			evaporates the good sir too . . .
			if only it were so easy
			in reality.
						dick and jane have zero shame-
						dick poses as
						a motherly dyke named Dimbi
						who elicits girls' secret fantasies;
					jane recruits boys of color
					to their horse ranch
					in montana, militia-country.
				they're anti-government, you see,
				but pro-shotguns and free-love-
				it gives their marriage a kick.
is it true what they say 
about latin men? jane purrs to a
dominican teen. i think she's seen
"la bamba" one time too many.
			i train thoroughbreds;
			wanna learn how to ride?
			she teases an african american lad,
				whispering privately
				to another haole girl
				in our virtual community,
					he'll do me 'cause
					it's every black boy's fantasy
					to screw a Caucasian woman.
i wish the two would tell her,
shut your flapping trap and
scrawny trailer-park legs . . .
but they're quite young
and it backfires anyway-
in this white space, she has them too scared
to be aroused.
					then some time, in real time,
					my fair male mainland prof
					declares the 'net
					a global, post-modern
					village of democracy,
					free from race, sex, age, anomie,
					and other chains of society.
	and I continue 
	to chuckle
	well into
	the next night,

<b>FAYE KICKNOSWAY</b>


<b>License</b>

From a window in Chicago
a woman looks out
at her front yard

buried in snow, and at her dog
and the mynah bird,
its Hawaiian shirt
and yellow legs and mask,

and understands that a piano,
or a giraffe,
would be more common
in the yard's flickering light.
She wonders why

the dog doesn't bark, why
it's so contemplative.

It is Chicago, and the street light
illuminates what she,
staring, understands
is improbable. It's the shirt,

and looking closer,
the cigar, that worries her enough
to open
the door and call the dog in,
where, she hopes,
he will be safe

from the aberration
that is occurring in the yard.

But it is the bird 
that enters, rips
its shirt and mask off, and leaps,
yellow dye

bleeding into the snow,
cigar tight in its beak,
to the woman's halo of blond hair.
It sinks its claws
through her skull
and lifts her out
of her familiar doorway.

The dog, unmoving,
very probably cardboard and the crow's
ruse-for it is a crow,
seems immune
to the woman's cries.

She dies, but not
in Chicago, rather
on Oahu, in Hawaii,
across from a beach
and the ocean
in a ditch
beside a red dirt road.

Her crying, 
then her listening, stop.
The crow,
exotic to the island,
amid flashbulbs, television,
tourists,
eats her, and rises.

Puffing its cigar, it plunges
through a prison
of bright yellow light
to a chain link fence
where it stands above its spidery
legs, derby hat black as snow,
with its mother, Murder,
and its father, Orpheus,
in the humid air
of Chicago. It is summer

and Sunday. The dog sleeps
in the shade
under the porch swing.
His mistress, her hair glowing
in the afternoon light,
mows the lawn, moving
monotonously back and forth
across the yard.

<b>BETH MURRAY</b>


<b>she thought she was marie curie</b>

she locked herself in her room and said I am going to spend the next four years in here 
extracting radium from pitchblende ore she requested a coleman stove and a phone book 
for sidney (she knew marie's pitchblende came from a refinery there) and stamps for 
writing her sisters and brothers during these four years just like marie but she did not 
need pierre she needed no scientist to betray the cause

she asked for a stack of books on karate because she said there was a correspondence 
between the phorphorescence of radium and the force that breaks a board radium can 
penetrate six inches of pine she thought her hand could too if she gave it time she 
asked for chocolate bread and cherries what marie had eaten the day before she 
fainted in the lab she would publish her results but not copyright just like marie she 
said she had scientific integrity her discoveries were the world's property only she 
would not run the radium van she said there was no war no reason to drive around 
healing soldiers she would leave that for the r.n.s

after two days in her room she called for a graduated cylinder she had dropped hers 
but she did not need a broom when they handed through a jelly jar she threw it back 
full of boiling water later when she needed salt she asked their forgiveness she said 
she might take students but she would not teach french she could afford only physics 
and chemistry and she would hope for poles

she would not have babies could not bear the soft skull breaking out of her uterus what 
use was it if they wanted to give her the nobel prize she would fly to stockholm but 
even then she might not come out of her room if she were to take a husband he would 
just die anyway the horses would trample his head he would be a dreamer and she 
would wonder what he was thinking when the cart rolled over his head piled twenty 
feet high with uniforms who needs them they would crush him his head she would 
undress him when he came to her dead clothes damp from rain and bits of brain she 
would cut them into squares throw them in the fire observe the flames agree to continue 
his lectures but without his last words I don't want to consider any more advances the 
advancing hooves or the retreating carts she said no thank you I will stay in my room 
extracting radium*
_____________________		
* Marie Curie was married to Pierre Curie who was chair of the Sorbonne's Faculty of 
Science. Pierre was killed by a horse-driven cart on the streets of Paris. He died instantly 
from a crushed skull. The Sorbonne asked Marie to take over her husband's position at the 
University. She began her initial address with the exact words that Pierre had ended his last 
lecture: "When one considers the progress that has been made in physics in the past ten 
years, one is surprised at the advance that has taken place in our ideas concerning electricity 
and matter . . . ."

<b>La Parure</b>

Utterly without strategy, learn gem tactics. This wearing or breaking down for erotic 
discharge, photographing historic calluses. Housemaid's knee degradation, or the only 
evidence we have. We. Reconstruct. The joke's on her, who dared aim at anything 
better, we play at Paste and never qualify. Designed to show off to advantage. A 
woman may sing, she's got a sweet little asset. Spent, again and again. Look me over, 
lend me the stretch marks stripes earned but may be devalued any minute if you're not 
careful. Meat market, even if you are. Seems only yesterday. As you were going to a 
feast-joke's on you, made a meal of. Object not agent. Mutton dressed up. Sic transit. 
Gross joke, will they be in the same place one day, mini titillation. Know the punchline 
when it comes.

I miss whiskey
regular fun
meet a girl

I miss whiskey
what a dope
now I'm sober
horny, 
broke

Whisky I miss
you I had

you're never alone
with an elbow

I play a guitar

I sit in nature
typical oinks

typical bahs, neighs

<b>BRIAN HENRY</b>


<b>From the Annals of the Healing Tradition</b>

I.

. . . roiled, not appeased the fantom driving the women to suicide
and murder, pestle working mortar, herded onto the vessel
most swiftly, pustules constellated across their faces, some foam-
spawn, forced to recline in their own faeces,
the days seem open to a new kind of despair-


II. 

and he tried to ignore the sores disfiguring,
and some thought him gallant to save these less than women,
their wombs the pits of prunes, of no use.

There were 30 of them on the ship,
29 to a room, the one led in each night
collared and crazed with hunger and the scourge,
strapped upright by the wrists and stripped.
A new one each night. He never whipped or beat the one-


III.

he did what came natural to a man with orders:
he asked for their fears and took notes.
Then into the water. This went on for a month.


IV.

The emperor sent a messenger with gold, praise
for his vision, then banished him to the sea or the colony.
The only other extant account is his own: The boils on the skin


V.

burn to the bone, to the brain. I questioned hundreds more
to find the cure and now the fire is on me, it sears,
it bursts, the fire my only fere until I kept one-
less hideous than the rest-from the sea. I bound her
days since. When the fire settles, swordless I bleed her,


VI.

and a new fire takes me heedless. I know
I will burn for this.

<b>The Stendhal Syndrome</b>

With a rush, and we do away
Look at those Brice Mardens
and the big horses of Susan Rothenberg
and the palette without color of Neil Jordan

Pleasure as a synonym for AIDS
its metonymic attachment to the body
the fringe on top of the surrey of living
easy without you, easy air Jordan

Color my world white, with veiny streaks of red
A terror at giving up my seat at the opera
the family box
I really fucked myself over, that box of steak.

Steel stripes shadow the steel pier-Brighton
Smegma nada, the reverse of what?-My dick
tiptoes through the sands in another's-shoes
a river wide, green desert ribbon-

Thin Straw That I Suck Life Through</b>

episode 7

					Trees in scale to the indigenous

		a child is silent but inquisitive

	old lady with a blue rain cap
        though it is not raining
        hair sculpted and preserved
        a floral arrangement
       the artifice signifies
        a dignity
           a lady

					bruises endured
					in fun
						the belligerence, the insult
							the pointed remark
				because the friend is otherwise

        reimagined in a Baroque composition

					a bloody knee
				            a fever wracked red

					        that radiates the wide print of a hand
					small stomach twisting Gordian knots
					         in dread



					through a cathedral of elaboration

				becomes our own
			groined vaults over buttresses
				and cool stone nave
				     mannerist stained glass narratives

		   brown eyes warm
		we tell our children
		Jesus saves

			if we were raised that way

this is a special kind of love

<b>DAVID BROMIGE


Hide the Poor</b>

Constituted for this purpose.

One beats & beats for that which one believes.

Piles driven deep into mud. Temblors were frequent. Solid as a self.

To maintain manoeuverability & independence. Begins with 150 million in assets. 
Begins with selling me a rug. Begins with peddling passports. Begins with product, 
ends in copyright, lives in gray area in between. The "O" Zone. Only the dead are cast 
in cement. Man overboard.

The irrational element in whatever you said it was. I had to bayonet him, because he 
had jumped into the trench where I was. My trench, to one view of things (mine). 
Having done it once, I did it frequently, failing to see the distinction until later-too 
much later. 

But when YOU tore the fivespot almost in half, it came back to me unscathed. And 
when I snatched the wallet, the explosion blew my glasses off. How did the second Ace 
of Clubs get into the deck? Civilization holds the answer.

The big man turns on a dime. A new voice issues forth. Yet distinctly a throwback.

Juts up like body parts until the age of two. Only a hand to trace sensation, only a

Your own worst nightmare. Two thousand of you marching up a country lane bearing

Net is Down.

The Veil is Rent. The opiates are stained with glass. The first time I saw you rip your

Face only a mother could sit on. That was somebody else. He is a handsome man. Are 
you movie star? Ektor? After midnight, a touch of Apocalypse Now. That's the 
religious impulse venting. We must take it in stride. It's a morality. It gives an 
experience of time. So does sucking blackheads out of our navels.

Behave, or be bounced: we can all hum a few bars. Being a song, being a character in a 
play: hiding our agendas. It came with invisible strings attached, like money. It was 
truth, inaudible to idols.

Limited Company. We skipped a decade. For charity, or for profit? Everybody aspires 
to the Swedish model, but that model may only work in Sweden. Another form of model 
is a decoy duck. It made him cantankerous before dinner.

He's just an average person. That question puzzles many people. Because thinking does 
make it so. You owe it to others. Practice this principle, treat them that way, your 
clothes will last twice as long, no blood or bulletholes. You'll be longer in style. Self-
importance where the sun never shines or mediocrity. Practice appreciation with 
personalized compliments. How many p's are splashing this all over the newspaper? If 
your answer was five or more, your're outasight. They're coming to realize you're 
important. Smile. You have a nice smile.

My father was Apeneck, Apeneck Sweeney. When environmental reports can go with 
pasta, I'll eat one. Face only a topper could shadow. To hear him talk. J.D., C.D., and 
F.K. agreed, kind of. I'll jot that down. Let them meet in the parrot: "What's your name 
I can report and embody at the same time."

The secretaries were treating the salesmen. Better or badly. Employees were trading 
minds, and not only their own. Looking from the standpoint of this being as new to me as 
it is to you, what do you think? Is the gift mine or his, to evaluate the reason for its 
having been purchased? We ate the turkey.

Thought 2</b>

Articulation is what's important or "What's important."     bumblebees
						             should be incapable of flight
		               How obvious construction
				          workers on a scaffold level
			           more of a pharmacy than a dictionary. A dictionnaire.

		Given: The speeder sped. He sped and sped.

The following figures will illustrate to you that,
the following figurative language will illustrate in such and such a way	<b>35.</b>
RECLINING FEMALE FIGURE (FRAGMENT)
South Germany (Augsburg?). Second third of the seventeenth century? Plump figure of 
whitish ivory polished to a dull finish that has yellowed considerably on the back 
side, and which in spots has turned to a brownish-yellow color.
Both legs are pegged above the knee (iron dowels visible), as are her left arm from the 
shoulder down (pin), and her right hand (pin). It is not easy to determine whether the 
iron pin on her back side is old. There is a diagonal crack over the body, on front and 
back.
H. 2 9/16 in. (6.5 cm.)
1917.317
The completely naked figure seems to stretch out her left arm horizontally, and is 
making a protective movement with her right arm in front of her. The hair, parted in 
the middle, is gathered together on the nape of the neck, partly plaited, and is 
artistically shaped like a cross.
The figure is perhaps a fragment of a multi-figured group of Diana with her nymphs 
(and Actaeon?), or of a composition such as Europa on the bull or Dejanira kidnapped by 
the centaur Nesus, as shown by Giovanni Bologna's bronzes. If this were the case, it 
would be strange that there is no sign of draping.

For instance: I didn't get rid of the cold, my body did.
For distance
After days of travel one longs for the simple pleasure of relaxation in a rural setting but 
in our mile-a-minute world full of cancerous cities and superhighways [sic] the bird and 
the bee never even meet. Time rushes. The bee hovers over a blossom or a photograph of 
a blossom or a projection of the blossom's photo or over the mouth of a beautiful woman 
saying "blossom" or flies acrobatically above the city spelling out   B-L-O-S-S-O-M 
with its flight path. The bird finds solace in little parks and gardens, fissures of life in 
the great dark stone that is our city. The bee hums but not loud enough. The bird 
performs a brief celebration of its wings and settles upon a ledge to peck at raisins an 
old woman leaves for it each day. The bee finds slicks in alleys and dumpsters and next 
to parked cars

the bird and the bee never meet, they are parallel, and they may appear to meet in the 
distance but it is only 
an optical illusion, they can be seen to converge and we are deceived, their separation is 
beyond the limits of 
sight and can be said to be invisible, but one may\sooner see an echo back to its source than 
find straight lines 
in the eye

3.  The bee is not to be trusted. Its buzzing is more than a standby warning, neither latent 
nor self-involved. When attuned to each other bees cooperate in highly ordered 
patterns, patterns with signals packed so close together they enmesh to the swarm 
with which we may be familiar. This living wall, if you will, can move in any 
direction and change direction on a whim, as entire schools of fish move. Still, it is not 
possible to connect a particular workshop with our statuette.

<b>At the North Pole</b>
	It's frozen. Sometimes so that light achieves a density.
	There's no language, only labored motion. 
		(editor's note stating that this proves the work is  fiction)
	Thought stiffens. Time is precarious to the point that the time wasted when one 
goes to pull a chair out from a table in order to sit at the table, and at first doesn't pull 
the chair out far enough, and so must pull the chair further out and devote more 
attention to the matter in order to complete it, this time wasted is infuriating and the 
repercussions of the event along a life are incalculable.
	Here the sun cannot navigate the atmosphere freely and runs the risk of being 
snuffed, trapped between frozen layers. So it occasionally darts along the sky's 
perimeter between the sheets of ice. And we resent its cowardice.
	The ice-bee reigns at the North Pole. Ice-bees are so tiny they hide from 
predators behind falling snowflakes. Native peoples believe that their misfortunes 
are caused by the conspiratorial ice-bees whose deeds, each individually too small to 
be seen by the human eye, sum to an inescapable doom. Ice-bees are blamed for cars not 
starting or for reliably thick ice cracking beneath a fisherman's feet. Ice-bees eat holes 
in hunters' coats and scarves and sting children's eyes until they fester and close.

<b>June 5:</b>
The pine's there and no doubt will be there tomorrow still. Merely by conceiving it I 
have created it. It's really a fairly poor tree. A finger's width of frayed fiber holds a 
great busted limb desperately to the trunk. Stopped on the verge of a fall (no, it's in 
mid-fall, it's falling) the branch's divisions and needles are enmeshed with those of 
limbs below, and this week's succession of thunderstorms haven't budged it from its 
handstand. One of the branch ends has snapped this season and the fallen span lays 
amidst its own bark, broken further (but not completely apart) upon contact with the 
ground. The siding on the back of the neighbor's house here is scrawled with charcoal 
mildew. The downed dog-legged branch appears soggy and the limb's broken tip has 
darkened with rot. Our pine's lowest healthy branch grows alone on the right side of 
the tree, seen from the vantage of my back porch. Its tip touches a maple plume-if the 
maple's entire shape is that of an inverted teardrop then the pine touches the maple at 
the tear's greatest circumference. This renegrade's needles fall upon an impressive 
shoulder of honeysuckle so dense that the vegetative structure beneath it is not 
identifiable. At ground level poison ivy laces the honeysuckle. The drilling bees feed 
here to fuel their perforation of my deck.
								How many
I have not examined the drillers closely but I have imagined them, their styluses 
spirally ridged like a screw's shaft, or grooved like a drill bit. But then I try to picture 
how they might drill in this way and I can only picture them twirling their bodies 
around in tight circles and this doesn't seem likely. I'm now sure they somehow eat the 
wood, like termites. Maybe they are part termite. When speech breaks down, it does it 
all the time, and we still listen to it, aspire. The bee reverses field without 
provocation when we talk to each other. If it was at all possible. Ifz. Aerodynamically 
the broadest bumblebees should be incapable of the slippage of wings through air, 
thought through a hoop of fire, sold off metaphors looted, riotous laughter, the 
artifacts of the insane. Bees can't lie. Still, bees can't lie, the air animates harmonicas 
and bottlemouths, waves try patiences, a stammer lines out to a shudder, reels in as a 
stutter, confessional letter arrives after phone conversation, parking fines handed out 
at a fund-raiser. And the shine of the museum floor at opening, the doors fluttering 
through like ornithopters, the bee exposed to direct sunlight emits, tongues store at 
constant temperature, times do I have to tell you, sauces congeal to scriably-smooth 
surface, bias dispe(n,r)sed from the dais, steel bee-like hovering, deafening chorus of 
thousands tearing paper in unison, blind alley, conductor's mouth, from those national 
whereabouts they pause long between their thoughts waiting for the teetering word to 
plummet a dead fall trap closing without the descending slidewhistle noise dropped 
bombs make, typed and typed, spoken true to the copy of the true, the "true," and a 
school of nascent truth spinning hintwebs around it, a volume of such webbing, so tight 
and minute to vast appear solid, a realm of it, to be it a medium in which we live like 
bees in air and sea-birds in the sea, those sigh sweet talks just the two of us, summing to 
that we just know in proximity without speech, intimate meaning held in outside 
words, vague silent paralinguistic orizons we rest our heads on to sleep at night, our 
buzzpillows, our buzzpillows.

General Motors</b>

It was not a time when thunderbolts steered things.
Heaven was empty and everyone was headed toward North Money, a city of parakeets
screeching beneath their hoods, for the rumor was of plenty of self-storage, and the angels
there all deputized.  No one had any idea it was shaped like the General's boot.  Toes 
throbbing, he said the problem with angels and parakeets is that neither can build a tank.  
Maybe it was all that dissonant music back in college all that erosion of formal thought.  
Certainly it was neither love nor assemblage.  It was simply the tarragon invading the 
terrace.

Metaphysicians were called in--the enlarged city was rumored to be breeding and some 
winged fellows were circling over head.  The solution was to remove the rooms without 
ever entering it.  Redecorate.  Sundays and Sunday was the business.  We had, as the 
General insisted, invested our sons.  It was not an emotional decision stuck as we were 
behind all those cars heading blearily into yellow feathers.  Sometime later, I insisted 
that the room had been filled with angels and that I could tell by the frost on their bills 
and could you please be a little less human about things, I don't feel like getting things
done.  I know an angel when I see one, said the General, it looks like me.  A matter of 
sitting still and seeing.  His daughter stood and walked toward the body opposite her 
own which was also unoccupied.

Perhaps if we'd learned the banjo, instead of the fork lift we could have prevented so 
many roundabout elisions, assuming that language could be anything other than a set of 
instructions: the page arrived and brought the page.  It was not an emotional decision.  
We were only looking for a room when we found the sceance, an angel dissected in the 
cup of ghost.  The banjo now seemed over-eloquent but it was July and the 
groundskeeper was missing, cannons boomed behind the third green, flowers of liberty 
burning a hole in the night.  Thought they looked like angels or parakeets 
though they tasted like chicken tarragon.  Quantity changes quality.  Perhaps that too 
is over-eloquent, said the General.

We thought work was the answer.  All those days lettering, all those lines across the pure 
immutable night.  Or a white page striped in white.  I believed the letter A was as good 
a place to start albeit the position progressively more precarious: angels preceding us 
and at dusk God shouting to keep it down.  But I was never against the angels themselves, 
only the conditions which required them.

Globe</b>

In the first chapter a raw wind blew up

and discovered streams of watery alarm,

the reader frozen in front of a silent knife

to escape the due pain. I'm arguing

stimulus-response, or motor inhibition

in the face of the inhuman demands of this print,

that reaches out of some corner of the past-

a grubby back room stinking of tallow-

and orders you to stop thinking like that, now

start thinking like this, and do the things

that are inevitable, given this new

political alignment of wish and fear-

no, let me think about a road that wandered

down the flank of a hill, through thick grass

under the moonlight, snowfields gleaming

on a distant glacier-no, I must read

these halting words that once leaked and stumbled

from the nib-I see them begin their journey

through the post, the type shop, printery,

warehouse, then trucks grunting through

the city streets and then the silence of a bookshelf-

high, almost out of reach, at the back 

of the self-help section in the shadows,

towards a happy auditor, or, lensed

and winking glints of light onto the kitchen table

the miserable viewer, I mean reader, hypercritical

at breakfast, and so taunt his target of scribble,

these doodles intersecting with his fate-

what did the Professor say?-a kind of hostile

curl to his lips, nausea-no ballot, no blame.

I felt like an electrical lead, carrying the news

down the cable to the TV hookup.

I could have chuckled at the way he slept

as he grunted and changed position-dreams

decorate the endless competition between

our hopes and what we get, or put another way,

between the good boys we hope we are

and the black thing shrieking in the cellar,

all rage and spittle. It's a ferry-that's it-

to carry things over, from one shore to another.

Theories never know the peaks, they just

endure the drudgery of the climb, then

some other bastard gets all the kudos.

The dealer was really the Professor, in disguise,

forged papers, taking a chance on the thin voice

that spoke economics: he looked up from a globe

where he was plotting his travels, for journalism

or a work of literature maybe, the strange future

that he was about to step into and vanish in-

like having to be a writer for the first time.

At the flower stand we lean over winter tulips into orange electric blossoms that fell 
roundly out of a Saturday morning cartoon landing breathless in this air.  What is it 
about a hothouse sky that makes us ache for lightning, for mouthfuls of muddy soil?
For a syntax we can chew on, one that can translate the tree back into its seed & 
make it hum.

<b><b>JONATHAN MORSE


Physics for Poets: </b> A Review of True North, by Stephanie Strickland 
		         (Notre Dame)

	Fill a glass with water.  Let it become still.  Gently add one drop of ink.  Wait and watch.  Over the 
next hours, its dye particles pushed along by the random molecular buffeting of Brownian motion, the ink will 
diffuse until it colors the water a uniform tint.  In that uniformity the drop itself, its roundness and blackness 
and self-containedness, will be lost forever.  You cannot put it together again.
	Underlying what you've just witnessed is an idea: the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the doctrine 
which tells us that the universe tends on an irreversible course toward disorder and death.  Poets like Emily 
Dickinson have always sensed that through their words, and in the middle of the nineteenth century the 
German physicist Rudolf Clausius enlarged the poetic vocabulary of the twentieth by isolating and naming 
the concept of entropy.  But it was in the United States, at Yale, that J. Willard Gibbs (1839-1903) gave the 
ink drop demonstration a significance accessible to measurement and mathematical conviction.  
	What Gibbs did was to reimagine physical processes as statistical processes, mathematically 
simplifying the material universe to an array of varying numbers.  Gibbs's achievement has had enormous 
practical value, but Muriel Rukeyser liked to think of it as one of the grand gestures of New England 
idealism, and she chronicled its coming into existence in the form of a long, impassioned biography-not, one 
would think, the most propitious genre, for Gibbs the man was a living caricature of the cloistered scholar.  
He never married, lived through the era of the Civil War without having a recorded thought about it, got 
one of the first telephones in New Haven but gave it up after a few years, lectured about vector analysis with 
tears of joy in his eyes but regarded the phrase "For example" as frivolous.  Edwin Arlington Robinson of 
Maine and Robert Frost of New Hampshire had terrible things to say about austerities like those.  Rukeyser, 
however, interpreted Gibbs's New England typicality as a license to generalize her narrative from the poor 
life at its center to a constellation of Gibbs's English and New English contemporaries: William James, Henry 
Adams, Charles Sanders Peirce, James Clerk Maxwell.  Now in True North, Stephanie Strickland has taken 
Rukeyser's insight and retranslated it into verse.  For Strickland, Gibbs and Emily Dickinson and Jonathan 
Edwards and Isaac Newton are all explorers in search of the polar light whose worth's unknown although 
his height be taken.  Strickland here joins Miroslav Holub, A.R. Ammons and a handful 
of others in an elite: poets who know science from the inside.
	But the language of True North, often enough, is only library science: a shelving of Gibbs in the 
archive of standard techniques.  So, for instance, Strickland's elegiac "It Is You Talking Just as Much" borrows 
its title from Whitman and its stanza form from William Carlos Williams.  Such appropriations make up 
the prosodic structure of True North.  The idea seems to be to increase the book's elegiac resonance by 
providing it with a genealogy in allusion.  So True North proceeds by recontextualizing, giving us 
performative titles in the style of Williams's "This Is Just to Say," Dickinsonian capital letters, and 
whimsical-finicky footnotes in the style of Marianne Moore, referred to in Dickinson's style with superscript 
plus signs, like this +.  Often enough, the performatives are merely introductory phrases and the footnotes are 
merely bibliographical.  Thematically, too, the gestures toward history seem arbitrary.  But what's 
interesting about that arbitrariness is the attitude it reveals toward language.
	For the language of True North, a book about physicists, isn't yet experimental.  Like astronomy 
before we began pushing at space with rockets, it is merely descriptive.  Down at the level of grammar and 
syntax, the old work of referring words as if to a non-verbal reality outside themselves goes on.  Strickland's 
"Heaven and Earth, 1666," for instance, sets out to celebrate Isaac Newton by erecting a verbal structure 
around the word "Attraction!"  If "Attraction!" had a meaning per se, the structure would be stable.  But 
"Attraction!" has no meaning per se.  It is only a part of language.
	The interesting thing is that Willard Gibbs himself thought of language metaphorically.  Strickland 
retells the poignant anecdote from Rukeyser: Gibbs faithfully attended faculty meetings at Yale for thirty 
years, but spoke only once.  The subject under discussion was a language requirement.

					The reward for
	getting past the failures of language? To be found
	un-readable. Gibbs rose. He said: Mathematics
	is a language. And he sat down.
		
		("Shortcut to What?," 62)

That punch line is worth spelling out.  If mathematics is a language, Gibbs spoke the dialect of the absolute: 
the words to the music of the spheres which sang through the emptiness of space, long before mind existed, 
that two stars and two stars are four stars, world without verbal end.  Yet here on the earth of an auditorium 
at Yale University, surrounded by all the particularity of passing time, Gibbs said something in time's mortal 
and imperfect creole, a sentence that stopped with a period.  It was all he could do.  It is all any poet can do, 
but some poets struggle to defer that final surrender to the not yet significant.  What is most interesting about 
True North, therefore, is perhaps this:
	Better than most poets, Stephanie Strickland understands what is at stake when we try to signify 
through words.  She has learned from science, and her book wants to teach us, that the things that are true 
cannot be spoken of in the incompletely significant words of any human language.  And yet she continues to 
write poetry as if that discovery were not in itself a discovery in language.  Moving large blocks of words from 
source to source, rearranging existing prosodic structures without deconstructing them, she makes traditional 
materials into a nest for new words.  But that nest serves only to protect the old words from transformation.
