<font size=6>THE INVISIBLE DOUBLES [a conceptual story]</font><br>

<p>

Every human being -- or for that matter -- every living creature on this
planet has an invisible double -- that double can either be benevolent or
malevolent -- but the visible creature does not know if his or her or its
invisible double is benevolent or malevolent -- the visible creatures of
this planet -- as history has shown -- are either benevolent or malevolent
- though it has been recorded in history books that on rare occasions a
malevolent creature can suddenly become benevolent -- a case in point herr
schindler -- and a benevolent creature can without any visible reason
become malevolent -- for instance the case of a pet dog that suddenly
bites the hand of his kind mistress while she is feeding him -- visible
creatures have no way of knowing whether or not their ID is benevolent or
malevolent -- but one day in the future a scientist invents a gizmo that
reveals if an ID is benevolent or malevolent --

now the real story begins -- an organization known only as O is formed -
under the leadership of the scientist -- known only as S -- who is a
malevolent creature -- this O that controls the gizmo sets out to
exterminate all the benevolent IDs so that it can be used by all the
malevolent IDs to enslave all the visible creatures -- benevolent as well
as malevolent -- but of course two visible human creatures -- known only a
P6 & R9 -- have discovered what the O is doing and are trying to save the
visible creatures of the planet from being enslaved -- P6 & R9 set out to
destroy one by one the members of the O who have the gizmos that destroy
the benevolent IDs -- the problem -- or
rather one should say the crisis -- is that the O has discovered what P6 &
R9 are doing and is pursuing them to destroy them before they destroy all
the destroyers of IDs -- the great moment of suspense of this story -- the
climax one should say -- in the fullest sense of the word -- comes when
only
one member of the O is left with the last gizmo -- of course the
malevolent S -- and P6 & R9 -- who have fallen in love with one another in
the course of their adventure -- are closing in on him -- but S is aware
that they are coming for him -- and now comes the denouement -- however
the
outcome of the confrontation between S and P6 & R9 will not be revealed at
this point so that the reader of this story can invent it -- <p>
