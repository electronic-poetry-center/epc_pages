<i>for Mark Peters</i><p>

Not just nothing,<br>
Not there's no answer,<br>
Not it's nowhere or<br>
Nothing to show for it -<p>

It's like <i>There's no past like<br> 
the present. It's <br>
all over with us. <br>
There are no doors...</i><p>

Oh my god!  Like<br>
<i>I wish I had a dog.</i><br>
Oh my god!<br>
<i>I had a dog but he's gone.</i><p>

His name was Zero, <br>
something for nothing! <br>
You like dog biscuits? <br>
Fill in the blank. <p>
