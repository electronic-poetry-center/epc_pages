THE MUSEUM OF IMAGINARY ASSES<p>

When one thinks of the millions and millions of people who have dreamed
before Leonardo's MONA LISA, one can imagine their sweet smiles had he
painted her ASS instead of her face. The ASS has captivated artists
throughout the ages, and in their attempts to capture the delights of this
ever changing shape they have given us an amazing collection of ASSES, for
instance<p>

the obscure asses of Rembrandt <br>
the celluoid asses of Rubens <br>
the pyriform and whiny asses of Cranach <br>
the geometrical asses of Picasso's Cubist period <br>
the long and supple asses of Modligliani <br>
the exotic well-rounded asses of Gaugin <br>
the mischevious asses of Fragonard <br>
the morbid asses of Signorelli's Resurrection <br>
the rustic but vicious asses of Ingres <br>
the sumptuous asses of Tintoretto <br>
the suggestive asses of Poussin <br>
the gracefully balanced asses of Maillol <br>
the asses-within-asses of Moore <br>
the blossomy asses of Renoir <br>
the skimpy asses of Dubuffet <br>
the nervous asses of Goya <br>
the angular asses of Holbein <br>
the shriveled asses of Brueghel <br>
the lyrical asses of Chass&eacute;riau <br>
the gushy asses of Bellmer <br>
the shy asses of Matisse <br>
the vulgar asses of Toulouse-Laurtec <br>
the hollow asses of Giacometti <br>
the intrepid asses of Schiele <br>
the disfigured asses of Magritte <br>
the insolent asses of Salvador Dali <br>
the immense asses of Lipchitz <br>
the shapeless asses of Courbet <br>
the slick asses of Arp <br>
the elongated asses of El Greco <br>
the non-existant asses of Motherwell <br>
the invisible asses of De Kooning <br>
the minuscule asses of miniturists <br>
the complicated asses of the Baroque painters <br>
