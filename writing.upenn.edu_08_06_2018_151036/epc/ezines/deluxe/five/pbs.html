You see, my friend, the reason I object to PBS is because, as I was saying
the other night to a gathering of friends who always
say, We Love PBS, We only watch PBS when we watch Television, or else CNN
for the news, and I got annoyed, irritated
even, to hear that again from them every time we talk about Teevee, and I
say to them, Oh by the way did you guys watch on
FOX the other night that fantastic porno sci-fi flick about these phallic
creatures from out of space who invade earth and fuck
everything, humans, animals, male and female, even objects, they come from
a planet recently discovered in the milky way by
the famous Nobel Prize Winner astronomer from Yale, Horny Hardon, which he
named, Planet Sperm X9, well, as I was
saying, I get so damn pissed when my intellectual friends, all of whom I
dearly love and normally respect, always say to me,
when I mention a Teevee show I really loved, We only watch PBS, it really
bugs me, and the reason I object to PBS is
because it's hypocritical, it pretends not to advertise commercially,
except companies and individuals that are so goodie goodie
generous, and makes-believe that the people who watch PBS drive only
deluxe foreign cars, never drink, never wear
underwear, never have to use deodorant or toilets, never need to take a
shower or a bath, never use a condom, never fuck,
and have a huge life insurance, stocks & bonds, children in private
schools, never go see X-rated movies, live in a
well-decorated, well-protected house in the good part of town, not far
from the airport and the car wash.... <p>
