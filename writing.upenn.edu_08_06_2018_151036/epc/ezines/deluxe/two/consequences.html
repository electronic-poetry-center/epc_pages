<font size=6>Three consequences of really believing in
Benign Reality 
might be:</font><br>
<font size=5>by Charlie Keil</font><p>

<hr width=75% align=left><p>

failure in the eyes of those who don't join you<br>        
failure to recognize "real" problems<br>            
escapism from truth<p>

fantasy<br>
harsh reality of where you actually live<br>
isolationism when you find out the consequences of the surrealness of it
all<p>

+ 's  =  more time for music, no hunger, no war<br>                 
 - 's  =  hunger, poverty, destruction<p>

living communally<br>       
musicking<br>       
elimination of  'fer' -  facism-ethnocentrism-racism<p>

clean earth<br>           
a one world tribe<br>       
continuation of human experiment<p>

participation<br>           
happiness<br>       
cooperative with nature<p>

personal and economic destruction (no job, inability to survive)<br>
total lack of responsibility<br>
total world chaos (if everyone ultimately believed, the world as we know
it
now would be dramatically different)<p>

peaceful coexistence<br>    
higher standards of living<br>              
overall raised level of Platonic love<p>

living a fun life<br>               being free of stress<br>            
having all life's necessities for everyone<p>
accidental hubris (believing Gaia will always provide)<br>
allowing oneself to be deceived by western capitalism hellbent on global
hubris (for a profit)<br>
being too ethnocentric to consider other cultures<p>

reality isn't as pleasant<br>
               many do not experience such
pleasures<br>   
depressing if it is not true to them<p>

happiness<br>          
less working, more playing<br>              coexistence with nature<p>
inner peace<br>            
living in harmony with one's environment<br>                   
living in harmony with other creatures<p>
disappointment<br>      betrayal<br>              
shattered hope<p>
recreation<br>            procreation<br>            creation<p> 
recreation>procreation>creation>peacefulness and happiness stem from
these<p>
ignorance<br>       delusion<br>         stupidity<p>
out of touch with pop
culture<br>      
not being able to function in a capitalist money-driven world<br>       
not realistic<p>mother nature is good<br>          nature is balanced<br> 
                 
nature is the center (of society!)<p> 
not being able to be content in today's "reality"<br>
creative overload, too much happiness<br>
families might get too big, you might mix up cousins names or something<p>
not achieving what is important<br>     
ignoring all the amazing things life has to offer<br>      
avoiding hedonistic aspects of life<p>
confusion<br>          depression<br>      
unhappiness<p>
total non-participation<br>       
alienation from the 'real' life<br>         fear of a black planet<p>
lack of responsibility<br>  economic destruction<br>        destructive
chaos<p>
death<br>           prison<br>                  hospitalization<p>
peace between all people<br>            respect for the earth<br>          
disappearance of imperialism<p> no purpose in life<br>          negative
outlook<br>       
everything is as it should be in black and white<p>losing your sanity<br>      
conforming to a group<br>         joining a band<p>
ignoring or overlooking the <u>non</u>-benign realities of the world
today<br>
not trying to solve the problems<br>
i can't think of another consequence because believing in benign reality
doesn't seem like it would really have many<p>
you could get too excited, you might die<p>

Author's Note:<p>

The title of this poem was an exam question in Musics of the World last
semester; the answers are taken verbatim from the pile of graded exams
with people
who got A's answers at the top of the page and low scoring exam taker's
answers finishing off the "found poem". I infer that pessimism and
optimism have
little to do with whether or not you are an A or a D student in Musics of
the World.<p>
