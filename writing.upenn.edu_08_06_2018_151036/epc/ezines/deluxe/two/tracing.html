<center><b>I>>> Disorientations</b><p><br>

You know how a place translates you?  How when you move in a place
you've moved to, the air
in your lungs carries new weight and the light carves land into language
you can't hold and the
clothes you bought last month start to chafe in odd places?<p>

You know how it feels to be a stranger?  To have no idea "what is below
the level of the visible?"  
To have no idea how to see fields and flatlands, domed sky, histories made
and undone here,
where I stand?<p>  

You know what it means to come to live in the kind of town that signifies
traveling through--
whistling all-night freight trains, lumbering Macks, the sweet neon of
roadside hotels, American 
crossroads to anywhere?<p>  

Do <u>you</u> know what traces of itself this town has erased
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hidden &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knocked down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gnawed off?<p>

"What is a (wo)man who has no landscape?"<p>  

"Nothing but mirrors and tides."<p><br>

THE TOWN OF</font><br>

TERRE
HAUTE</font><p>
</center>
WILL commence on the last Monday of October 1816, on the spot and under
the superintendence of the proprietors, and continue for two days, if
necessary, upon a credit of one and two years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Town has
just been laid out upon one of the most liberal
plans, as it respects healthiness and terms.  It is not presumed nor
intended that art can or shall counteract nature, but assist and promote
her views; for any and all situations on the River Wabash either above or
below Vincennes, Terre Haute is supereminently entitled to the precedency;
not only from its elevated situation, being upon a high Bank of the river
(from which circumstances it derives its name) immediately below Fort
Harrison--the richness and depth of the soil, not only at the town but for
miles of the adjacent and fertile plain, called Fort Harrison Prairie; and
a country abounding with timber "fit for the builder's use," and extensive
Coal Banks--Besides, it is a known and acknowledged truth, that there is
no other eligible situation for a town for a number of miles above or
below this site, other than the Lands owned by the proprietors of Terre
Haute, and of their extensive claim they have selected the best;
competition is therefore silenced.  It is deemed necessary merely to
observe, that the Wabash is navigable for Keels and Batteaux, at all
seasons of the year, from its Rapids here, and for one hundred miles
above.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent of
those natural advantages, there are artificial ones
such as few towns possess, for the Streets are from sixty-six to one
hundred feet in width.  Every Lot has the advantage of an Alley of sixteen
feet.  And ground has been appropriated for a Court and Market-Houses, and
other public buildings, Churches, Schools, &c.  It is rationally and
confidently expected that ere long a new county will be formed in this
part of the country and that Terre Haute will in all probability be the
Seat of Justice.  And those who are acquainted with the Geography of the
country, do not hesistate to express their belief that a public Road will
shortly be opened from the State of Ohio direct to this place, and hence
to St. Louis.<p><br>

</center><p><br>

teeny houses hunker down for day's slow crawl<br>
porches stretch south at 45 degrees<br>
walnut-paneled warrens clutch at tight shoulders<br>
cement-blocked RVs sit lit, preoccupied-- <p> 

I pass for miles on straightaways, sucking air, tailpipe kissing flat ass,
looking for snow--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna tongue
your snowbelt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little lower--<p>

how to say this could be beautiful<p>

how to say this is someone's home<p>

church on every corner, down every dirt road<p>

tanning salons spark state highways<p>

thick heat sutures the midwest close--<p>

america's burning heart, burning cross--<p>

trains flay prairie gone to corn and plow--<p>

flayed flat land is flayed flat body planted into chemical rot fertile
treeless food ooze, trains like ventricles pump pump diesel fuming night
tracks bones spread to moonlight's kiss and fuck my country tis of thee
whistles to sleep butchered sheep rising to sit at the right hand of thin
father's tight-fisted quitting cough &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jello
voices gaggle and
shiver tiny shoots towards greening belly, loamy muscle a sure shot for
rooting tight<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a
kick in the gut, becoming<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth,
earth-bound<p>

twitch and sway, we're tiny tiny lights against bitter winds pleasuring
stretched skies<p><br>

<b>IV>>> Orientations</b><p><br>
</center>
	
learn about perspective:<p> 

drive a midwestern state highway, parallel lines to a plowpoint, roots of
no return.  fields are <i>not</i> the ocean.  earth split open, black
musculature heaving green and gold ears north like pressing promises,
christian earthworks, ragged orchards, hybrid seed passing for breadbasket
white--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recycling as
income-producer, not an earth first move--<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust by
which the eye penetrates space--<p>                

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whose</i> 
body
follows thrust into view--<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whose</i> 
body
<u>becomes</u> the landscape<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes
crisp-pressed land rising receding<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whispering to
make you lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closer--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touch
me, there--<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here--<p>


The shrinking of an object with distance implies the length of time needed
to reach the object.<p>

Or, we recognize a friend's face up to 80 feet, apprehend a body's gesture
from 450 feet away.<p>

focal points deflect,<br> 
bounce curves in the road.<p>

buildings askew<br> 
orient people to themselves<br>
as turning points,<br>
undulations--<p>

what I'm remembering is what looks familiar:<br>
stray wisps of hill, woods gripped dormant,<br> 
cricks rippling mobile homes peopling Andrew Wyeth browns:<p>

sweet supplication, a legless sky:<p>


place opening to home when a distant hillside restricted into panorama
bursts suggestion like dappling rolled windows when I remember who wrote
that song a lying down in exile river bend play it harder claims and
the
book about fugitives laterally bounded yet attentive to sudden shifts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drops &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
terrain renowned for relentless lengths of time--<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abandoned
farmhouses are chrysalides, desertion signifying hope.<p><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cities,
buildings rarely stand alone--<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts of rows
viewed with angular distortion in passing--<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sides of
urban canyons--<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose
languages I hear in my hands--<p><br>

<b>V>>> Longings</b><p><br>
</center>

Legible landscapes compose themselves to the eye through the tastebuds,
kinesis, cilia and armhair, crenulated riverbanks coursing over
handpainted toenails, through what kind of cloud cover allows how much
light to fall at what latitude and longitude at some particular hour
minute and second of a day when the sun rises at 8:03 and sets at 5:56
and
tomorrow will be two minutes longer thank your diety of choice<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legible
landscapes are composed, compose me, decompose, comply,
compromise, confabulate,<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are composite
functions factorable into two or more prime factors
other than one and themselves--<p>

tree soaked curl up track down fourbyfourbyfour
topographical maps mound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fingerprints<br>
clinging &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red highways
presumptuously belly-up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pregnant with
wrinkled letters<br> strengthened by vitamin D
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spreading fast<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cumulous,
cumulo-nimbus<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressure
clipped wings<p>

monologue shreds in light rain's minimalism<p>

<b>VI>>>   Roads Belong in the Landscape</b><p><br>
</center>

Which came first, the house or the road leading to the house?<p>

Which of the two objects had been divinely ordained to <i>be</i> first?<p>

<i>He</i> would have ordered us to put down roots---<p>

<i>He</i> would have ordered us to beat a path---<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;migrations,
invasions,
wanderings, face---<p>

From that point of view, <i>house</i> was the right answer.<p>

Roads serve us by taking us home.<p>

Left to their own devices<br>
they tend to wander<br>
into the wider environment<br>
and disappear.<br>
Introducing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outsiders<p>

(Fugitive Cain built the first city)<p>

Disqualified by genealogy<br>
outclassed by the prestige of private space<br>
roads suffered from neglect,<br>
were dismissed as unsightly<br>
crooked spaces---<br>
merchants &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highway robbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invading armies.<p>

As men and women for whom path and road stand human,<p> 

we are now less interested in origins than in what comes
<i>after</i>---<p>

<i>roadlike</i>---<p>

railroad lines pipelines power lines flight lines assembly lines---<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freedom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freedom<p>

Roads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't
lead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they
are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;places<p>

growth dispersion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magnets 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth dispersion 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magnets<p>

look around your hometown.<br>
take your landscape with you.<br>
study everyday margins:<br>
cornfields and backyards<br>
abandoned plant life<br>
Trees of Heaven<br>
sunflowers in railroad yards<br>
lilies in alleys<br>
wild lettuce on a vacant lot.<br>
our own native flora is bred for our violence.<br>
it goes into winter condition with a bang.<p>

camp followers are plants and animals, not always domesticated, which
choose (for very good reasons) to live near people, to follow them when
they move elsewhere:<p>

weeds and insects<br>
rats and mice<br>
raccoons and deer<br>
billboards and gum wrappers<br>
assorted birds and relatives<br>
daisies<br>
yarrow<br>
buttercups<br>
plantain<p>

sunflowers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prefer
full sunlight, terrain disturbed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dislike
grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hate
competition from other plants<br>
seek an environment where the soil is open and bare<br>
from which all existent plant life has been suddenly<br> 
removed from every plowed field<p>

unwind where you can plant wheat,<br>
jigsaw shoulder to shoulder<br>
room to spare<p>

not every plant<br>
animal<br>
insect<br>
person<br>
adjusts to such open<br>
dumps<br>
highway cleavage<br>
wrecking-ball cities<br>
manicured flowerbeds<p>

it's a vastly intricate business<br>
which plants and people they will/<br>
will not tolerate as neighbors,<br>
and under what conditions.<p>


Once upon a time,<p>

the face of the habitable earth was everywhere <p>

scored and crisscrossed by paths and tracks,<p>

trails made by animals in search of other animals to eat.<p>

Some led to waterholes, salt licks, plots of edible grass.<p>

All the paths were bare of vegetation, and smooth,<p>

took a meandering course.<p>

Now we register posture, gait, how strangers respond to the presence<p>

of others. As skill in walking---<p>

reaction to motion along a prescribed path---<p>

touching the sky has to do with where you are standing, how light seeps or
shifts---<p><br>
