Capitalism was an atmosphere susceptible
to virological ipseities


then    whatever the noun was    came
and desire got reversed


biscuits as tense as any satire
spelled with a why


(and why not that practice of reflection
as a work,


a body's lifetime under
exigencies,    and what makes this parallel
to oddball cause


an irritant
as gnats to light with


the energy squared off




selected
