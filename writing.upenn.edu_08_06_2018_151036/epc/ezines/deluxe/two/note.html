<font size=5>editor's note</font><p>

<hr width=75% align=left><p>

Well, this issue took MUCH longer than I hoped it would . . . more poems
just kept appearing, and more distractions, and etc. But here it is . .
.<p> 
I would like to hear
what
you think of DELUXE RUBBER CHICKEN, and I would welcome unsolicited
submissions for issue #4, which I'm hoping to get up on the web before the
computers all self-destruct.<p> Mail to:

<a href="mailto:petersm@acsu.buffalo.edu">petersm@acsu.buffalo.edu</a><p>

Issue #3 will be
devoted exclusively to Sam Stark's book WISCONSIN, which I will be
publishing in its entirety. This should be available in a few months.
Thanks for reading.<p>

<ul>Quote of the day: (from David Greenberger's <i>Duplex Planet</i>):<p>

I've been to the moon and there's a lot of assholes up there. And I got
rid of a lot of them. I like it here when we're all together. We have more
fun than they do up there.<p>
