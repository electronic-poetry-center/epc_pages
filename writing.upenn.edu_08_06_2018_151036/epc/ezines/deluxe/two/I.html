I think we should kill him.<br>
I don't mean that in a "bad" way, it's<br>
just something they teach you in law school.<br>
Omitting only the provision I promise not<br>
to invade Poland.  Cash only and we<br>
still want to see your ID.<br>
A pain of the neck as you say here.<br>
Your moma is so dumb she saw a sign that said<br>
"Wet Floor" so she peed on it.<br>
The way to a man's heart is<br> 
through his chest.<p>
