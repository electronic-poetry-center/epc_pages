Dear oh dear,
 
My flesh-colored mirror:
 
"You can't do anything, except you don't have to yell immediately."
 
Saint Louie's view:
 
S       Cradle-arms
VT      language
DO      respect.

The drums of irony scavenge the nightmares of omniscience.
I wanted to say omnipotence's nightmares, but went with it.
What I mean is the cultural æffluvium processed by massed media.
What I mean is the social role many _____'s are taking on themselves.
"When their dream is the world's nightmare we will be there
        like vultures to shock them in their dream."
Until they harmonize the oneiric essence
or decide never to close eyes again.


Dear Odin:
 
never met a soul
who'd rather be a phantom
than an apparition.
We're partitioned
by the nightstand, of late.
 
(And set to auto transmit,
if you must know.)

Each unique communique
a closering of ______________.
                                love,
                                Evolving Bureaucrat
 
P.S. You've truly yet to see
love kick through the land.
