Thanks to the magic of the information superhighway, I don't even know<br> 
who Sandra Bullock is and<br> 
I'm still waiting to watch her get fucked.<br> 
Nothing discourages<br> 
pornography more than<br> 
a 9600 baud modem.<br> 
It's important to give psychos the<br> 
benefit of the doubt.<p>

"Why did your mother burn your copy of Catcher in the Rye?"<br> 
"She didn't just burn my copy, she burned the whole house down." "Why<br> 
did she burn down the house?"<br> 
"My copy of Catcher in the Rye was inside." You want to circle that on<br> 
your calendar with a big smiley face. <br>
Fate and too many pain killers, <br>
my favorite combination. <br>
Factories, assembly lines, <br>
armies, churches and prisons. <br>
Yes, <br>
it all makes sense.<p> 

I want to live where <br>
the busses don't run. <br>
Sing and dance and lie down dead.<br> 
It's like the love Johnny and I have for each other, like watching<br> 
television in <br>
a cheap motel off Highway 6 in Marriotsville Ohio, like<br> 
an old man returning soup in a Deli. It's nothing personal but<br> 
I never liked you. <br>
You're really annoying.<br>
The next day I sobered up and<br> 
remembered I <br>
still had some whiskey left.<br> 
"So how do you like America so far?"<p>
