Stare into the common<br>
inspiration, comma<br>
that's scrambled, instinctively.<br>
The joy that's hetero, blimp<br>
of scholastic, stamped<br>
harmony.  To traipse this town, around<br>
docks and squares in<br>
professional equations (originality<br>
the code "can-do's" of syndactylic<br>
senates that are shorn<br>
of a stable fit, fixed<br>
in stationary tents) assured<br>
as a Leveler stinking politics. As a nun done<br>
in a town that is fun, in January.<p>
