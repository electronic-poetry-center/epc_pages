I don't think I like this<p>

or<p>

I don't think I understand this<p>

or<p>

What does this mean?<p>

or<p>

Can we autostart a dialogue<p>

or<p>

Where do you want to go losing your life today?<p>

or<p>

How do you fuck your machine?<p>

or<p>

How does your machine fuck you?<p>

or<p>

How do you, as a machine, fuck yourself?<p>

or<p>

I definitely don't like this<p>

or<p>

I can not relate to this but will try it for you anyway<p>

or<p>

Can I see your data and maybe slip inside your virtual reality?<p>

or<p>

What is in it for me?<p>

or<p>

How much will it cost to be with you?<p>

or<p>

Who is making this happen for us?<p>

or<p>

What do they want from us?<p>

or<p>

Would you like me to be your Daddy?<p>

or<p>

Would you like me to fold myself into you?<p>

or<p>

How would you like to swallow my latest work of art?<p>

or<p>

How does this manifest itself as idea-engine?<p>

or<p>

I have a simple answer to everything<p>

or<p>

Maybe we can forget about it and not agree<p>

or<p>

What if you sucked me now?<p>

or<p>

I'm open to everything just leave me alone<p>

or<p>

Only my mother can tell you but she is dead<p>

or<p>

Why do you tell me these things but then never answer my email?<p>

or<p>

Who is responsible for shitting the glue of minds?<p>

or<p>

Fuck my masterpiece and make it cum<p>

or<p>

Dream of having my baby after you murder me<p>

or<p>

Kill the fugitive that pretends he is me<p>

or<p>

Let's go dance on the water and make serious moonlight spill its white
death all over our punctured bodies<p>

or<p>

Hack me into your reality and I will never stop<p>
