<font size=6>House in Order</font><br>

unfortunately I got involved in video gambling over the internet<br>
it's how my wife died<br>
little did we know that<br> 
we couldn't just stop when we felt like it<br>
the company is very influential<br>
but not like the mob<br>
their influence was more pervasive<br>
when we tried to back out<br> 
the wrath of Satan poured down on us<br>
they had many goons<br>
to try and stop us from leaving the<br>
fairgrounds where we first ran into video gambling<p>

they were very nice to us at first<br>
we were given free treats like<br>
metro tokens, which we needed,<br>
but then my wife and I got into a small argument<br>
Mr. & Mrs. video poker were not happy she had left her spot at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;internet
station<br>
their large stand was cluttered<br> 
but not dirty & it shook with fury<br>
when they found out I poked through some of their stuff<p>

anyway they were going to kill my wife, they had a lot of goons<br>
and they knew what we looked like<br>
at first the police were a little help<br> 
but when their shift ended at 5:00 they didn't understand the
magnitude<br>
of the problem and went home<p>

fortunately there was 1 big and strong cop<br>
who helped us out, took a liking to us<br>
but by this point the full wrath of the Video Gambling Organization<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was
being put down upon us<br>
they were ready when the police got off shift<br>
If the workforce would have never been specialized by civilization<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there
wouldn't have been these goons<br>
Unfortunately it was and there were<br> 
and the goon that got us was sort<br>
of an android, he had transformed<br>
himself into a giant pendulum shaped like<br> 
a shovel when our vehicle, an airbus,<br>
went underneath a bridge he wacked us<br>
and jumped in<br>
Fortunately our protector got on top of<br> 
the vehicle with him but it was bad<br>
when he got sliced to pieces by<br> 
the super human<br>
but it must have been the rebirth of the human body, because our<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friend
who was just a human<br>
assembled himself back together from many cut up human pieces<br>
and killed the android<br>
we saw this visually stunning triumph from the video surveillance
camera<br>
that was placed on top of the vehicle<p>
