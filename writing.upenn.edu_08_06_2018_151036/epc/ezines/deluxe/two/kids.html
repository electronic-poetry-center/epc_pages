It was absolutely gorgeous today. In fact I've never seen anything like
it. I knew for the first time that I was finally over Margaret, that 
nothing she could do would ever hurt me. I laughed all the way to the 
bank, and it seemed as if the world laughed with me. You can't be too 
careful nowadays!<p>

Still, there was this gnawing thought: what if it _wasn't_ Bill at the 
cafe that day - what if everything we've believed in turned out to be a 
horrible joke? You could tell he had a heart of gold by his prickly 
exterior; the kids used to call him "Pops." One day she just about lost 
it. But my lover was perfect and we'd talk late into the night, take long 
walks, and cuddle together under the sheets. I never felt so comfortable 
in my life, in spite of the fact I had a million things to do!<p>

You've got to have a hearty meal to start a happy day! For breakfast, I
always make sure to have food from the four basic groups, Nowadays, the
kids are hard to get away from the computer. Sex isn't all that it's
cooked up to be, but you never know until you try. This weather's making
me turn to thoughts of love!<p> 

Things were different back when I was a kid. The world was simpler then; 
you know, the kids nowadays listen to that strange music and they grow up 
with the computer. You know, they take the computer for granted, not like 
when we grew up. You couldn't take the kids for granted then!<p>

My dad was born before the invention of the hand-ax! You'd have to pull 
the trees down with all your might! Mom wore an apron. You should have 
seen the four of us huddled around a cozy fire. There's nothing like that 
nowadays, you can be sure. Nowadays, kids get all their firewood from the 
computer!<p>
