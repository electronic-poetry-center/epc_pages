<font size=6>Backflow Prevention Assemblies</font><br>
<font size=5>by Steve Carll</font><p>
<hr width=75% align=left><p>

Propulsed through a meridian's<br>
tai-chi kundalini buzz<br>
what once described itself as "I"--<br>
your stereotypical bomb-faxing anarchist<br>
new outrageous alien from the planet of flirtatious genitalia<br>
cocky thief and proud possessor of Breton's neglected bullshit
detector<br>
set on overload<br>
and hidden in the silent abyss of the audience--<br>
new tumescent rainstorm of the future.<p>

Legitimacy squabble<br>
begins its opening-up<br>
among atonal meat arcs<br>
based in southwestern<br>
red light havoc,<br>
eyes a googolplex of marvelous gigabyte-marks<br>
straining against the palette flash<br>
derived from the 256 colors<br>
of Avalon ballrooming in your<br>
ocular capturing software.<br>
Who's the dame with the classy chassis?<br>
The wine lay loaded in the bowl.<p>

So, spurred forward by grammar, our hero<br>
is plunged into central nervous syzygy.<br>
Bookish alignment threw out the spine.<br>
Planet of the primates has landed today.<p>

I relinquish the delinquent.<br>
Talk and tale turns:<br>
being disappeared in Disneyland's penal system,<br>
another fast brother, whacked by The Mouse.<br>
Deltoid spasm.<br>
Some barrel of insomniac monkeys<br>
and their devious meditation.<br>
Public service with a smile.<br>
If only viruses & germs could be trained to obey our bidding;<br>
that's what they're thinking.<p>
 
Did you know drill instructors barked?<br>
It's a catastrophic range.<br>
Forced apart, the tenure of our disastrous ecology, but<br>
Has anyone explored the etymological connection between crisis and
critic?<br>
A scooping media patterned after frenzy:<br>
science, on the fly, at the helm.<br>
Cyber.<br>
Attention bridge spanning two fictions.<br>
Criss-crossing to indicate self-awareness.<p>
