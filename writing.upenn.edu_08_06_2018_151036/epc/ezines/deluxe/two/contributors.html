Peter Balestrieri is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He
has a
brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider at the
center of
its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well
every
quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans. But his
agents are numerous and splendidly organized . . . the central power
which
uses the agent is never caught - never so much as suspected. His work
has
appeared in RealPoetik, The Experioddicist, n/formation, and
potepoetzine.<p>
