Abandoned the actual. Made it<br>
flick, weave like animal rope, dis-<br>
membered faculty asseverating<br>
unity at the head of a gun rack,<br>
perspectival pleasure measured<br>
like bull whips against the post<br>
that saddles us with direction; it<br>
was all away from, that bevy<br>
of years whose forehead beaded<br>
like a sail in the advertent wind.<p>

Angels are also birds, their wings<br>
rubbed raw by flight simulators<br>
and the virtual flak that downs<br>
commercial aircraft; amid all<br>
that circuitry, the holiest of<br>
navigators requires his compass<br>
and the coil that anchors him<br>
to pattern, aircraft control patter<br>
the Bach of background static.<p>

Where the family advertiser hangs<br>
her hat, baby can't be far behind,<br>
her bathwater screams prophesied<br>
by milk (substance of her poems),<br>
suspended between condos, uni-<br>
similar equivalents whose art is<br>
in distinction; the bushes were<br>
different so I didn't waltz in, just<br>
turned my heels and walked toward<br>
the next parking lot, having taken<br>
my path in the woods, or words<br>
diverging from the trees they may<br>
some day hang on, like stencils<br>
on the face of a magician typist,<br>
processor to the stars. Show me<br>
the map again; where has our star<br>
gone and when will it be back<br>
to flicker in, winch us to our actual<br>
fate, this twosome cast on invisible<br>
historical forces whose mention<br>
is oblique in our periscope?<p>

The sea has it, and its caves, those<br>
lips stiff yet inviting, the salt kiss<br>
of our arrival at the coral gate,<br> 
pacing more quickly beyond<br>
the zen garden's blurred bounded-<br>
ness, peripatetic philosophers<br>
indistinct to the untrained. School<br>
kids in navy blue skipped down<br>
the walk by the brown temple<br>
and the stream that glinted apart<br>
from any city measured by its<br>
valley's clutter, these arbitrary<br>
because random moments<br>
acquiring currency only this<br>
instant and then gone like<br>
the Eddie Would Go bumper-<br>
sticker on a Jeep in a Kyoto<br>
garage; arc of relation that<br> 
pulls like a faucet drain<br> 
down the article of my<br> 
memoir posted on a bulletin<br> 
board in a dark city where<br> 
she pretends to be a me<br>
capable of a new make<br>
(not yet pronounced<br> 
"makay"), tags of my<br> 
present vehicle unexpired.<p>
