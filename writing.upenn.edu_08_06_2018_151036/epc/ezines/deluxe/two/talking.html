She has deep brown eyes and shoulder-length chestnut hair.<br>  
Her body is perfectly proportioned and she stands about 5' 5" tall.<br>

The sun rises in the east.<br>
Tiffany says 'I think we should figure out what we're going to do and<br>
which program we're going to work on since there are things that can
be<br> 
done easily on one mud but not another'<p>
