<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>For Jackson Mac Low</i><p>

Avuncular proceeding <br>
A bench harbors a seedling <br>
Black as any crow <br>
A mouse can be so slow <br>
So gently humbly bleeding <p>

Flamingo catcher demon <br>
The gimmick of a he-man <br>
House arrest canary <br>A scimitar that's scary <br>
This python's daydreamin'<p>

Ptarmigan psychology <br>
Orangutang theology <br>
Pre-biblical prairie dog <br>
Plutocratic pocket mouse <br>
Plunk-down mange pathology <p>

Petticoat pessimist <br>
Approbation optimist <br>
Neorican duck's feet <br>
Mudpuppy mucksheet <br>
Monte Carlo copper sleet <p>
 
Self-stimulation Thursday <br>
Sanctuary birthday <br>
Rationalize <br>
Quantum mechanize <br>
Randomly spotted margay <p>
 


Morphological nitpicking venue <br>
Rabbit hole vegetarian menu <br>
Nimbus glory <br>
Poker-faced bunny mummy <br>
And the loudest radio galaxy <i>I</i> ever knew <p>

Pool room exaggeration <br>
Flammable glandular ablation <br>
Zinc bar <br>
Candle star <br>
Stevedore stillbirth amplification <p>

Tenacious turmoil promptitude <br>
Agglutination turpitude <br>
Stylized a tutu <br>Reclined atop a choo-choo <br>
Took in the dik-dik's solitude <p>

Ridiculous ridgepole rafters <br>
Secondary shotgun crafters <br>
I smell a rat <br>
Flexography hat <br>
Flibbertigibbets ran after <p>

Academic battlement flickering <br>
Boxturtle blazer dyke's bickering <br>
Bauhaus functionalism <br>
Intramural individualism <br>
Laughable latitude lingering <p>
 
Lavender Mexican jumping bean <br>
Pussyfoot fuselage steam machine <br>
Mezzanine horse <br>
Pidgin English course <br>
Never a tear in her gabardine <p>



Lipopoly sacharide shipboard <br>
Sanctimony samovar clipboard <br>
Mercator projection <br>
Manatee protection <br>
Layabout leitmotiv stiff-bored <p>
 
Pokerface fisherman noodle <br>
North-seeking kit and caboodle <br>
Pedigree permit <br>
Raggedy hermit <br>
Rambouillet redingote spooler <p>

Thickwitted sportsmanship meaning <br>
Thespians' trachia cleaning <br>
Underemploy <br>Walk a borzoi <br>
Webfooted weasel-baby gleaming <p>
 
Quintuplicated cardigan <br>
Wrapped around a ptarmigan <br>
Monorail rattlesnake <br>
Rabble-rouser drink take <br>
Danced around the room again <p>
 
A sweet william suicided <br>
Just because she decided <br>
To fall into a quagmire <br>
Lose the mottles we admire <br>
I think she was a little bit misguided <p>
 
Zebulon afterglow <br>
Clerihew red wine snow <br>
Clapperclaw battlefield <br>
Christmas card absinthe yield <br>
And a lumpy-bumpy radio <p>
 


A brazen bilateral bikini <br>
Worn by a Malatesta in Rimini <br>
Turned a docile gorilla <br>
Into a chinchilla-like killer <br>
And demolished all the linguini <p>

Kingfisher birdie num-num <br>
Kettledrum fe-fi-fo-fum <br>
Kleptomaniacal kiwi bird <br>
Steely-eyed flightless and quite absurd <br>
Offering everyone sugar-plum <p>

Hoerspiel measurment <br>
Visigoth impediment <br>
Sentimental journey <br>Jacknife attorney <br>
Climbing up the tenement <p>
 
Rosa took a ride on a bulldozer <br>
Deep inside the city of Mendoza <br>
She was reading a book <br>
That she got from a cook <br>
Who recommended she familiarize herself a little bit at least
   with Spinoza <p>

Foolie fooly amber glue <br>
When does Apu follow through <br>
Who is who and who is who <br>
Gruesome threesome true-blue cuckoo <br>
Do I write this poem or do you <p>

The time has come to face the music <br>
No mechanic need to panic <br>
Tell the story of jiggery-pokery <br>
Unsalted nunnery <br>
Fully deductible and organic <p>


Thirsty celestial oddity <br>
Celery soup Steinbeck commodity <br>
Slightly perturbed <br>
At being a Serb <br>
Droopy like polytonality <p>

Energy spectrum Amazon dodge <br>
Spinach in Greenwich comfortable lodge <br>
Henpecked seaweed <br>
Nympholeptic Ganymede <br>
Considering all of this a little bit odd <p>

Language is relational and systematic <br>
Free will, on the other hand, is downright cinematic <br>
Relevance of meaning-structure <br>Tiny prickly acupuncture <br>
What could be more enigmatic <p>
