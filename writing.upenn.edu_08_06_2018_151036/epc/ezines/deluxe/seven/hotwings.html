The chicken wing factory is lit up in flames <br>
and the flames are the wings of the little hot chickens.<p>

The little hot chickens are the lampshades of the night<br>
glowing inside the burning of dawn.<p>

The dawn light is chicken-light for little white chickens.<br>
The chickens are white like the glowing of coal.<p>

The coal light of chickens are the white light of chickens.<br>
The chickens are burning and bright in the sun.<p>

The sunlight and lampshades are brighter than chickens.<br>
The dreams of the chickens are bright as the sun.<p>

The chickens are filled with the hot coals of lampshades.<br>
The chickens are burning, the chickens are done.<p>
