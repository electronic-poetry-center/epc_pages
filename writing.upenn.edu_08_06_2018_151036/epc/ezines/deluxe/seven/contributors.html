Mary Begley has been grounded in Buffalo, NY ever since her marriage fell
apart after graduate school, which is also when she hit the bottle pretty
hard and threw herself into a life of sin and decadence. By day she is a
not-so-mild-mannered label exec for Righteous Babe Records; by night she
is
performance artist/singer/songwriter Mimi Bourgeois. An abstract painter
by
heart (and head) for as long as she can remember, Mary has taken to visual
poetry in recent years after trading some paintings for a Macintosh
computer. Her poems are stories, true stories, which deal with things we
do
to ourselves, and things we do to others, in the course of interpersonal
relationships. The pieces you see here are from her second chapbook,
<i>Book
Two: Anabasis.</i> You can't get this book (or the one which came before
it)
anywhere because she makes them herself on her sewing machine and it's
broken now. If you have something to say to her or a story to tell, send
it
to mebegley@hotmail.com <mailto:mebegley@hotmail.com><p>

Edgar Allan Poe: 1809-49, American poet, short-story writer, and critic,

           one of the most brilliant and original writers in American

the modern detective story.<p>
