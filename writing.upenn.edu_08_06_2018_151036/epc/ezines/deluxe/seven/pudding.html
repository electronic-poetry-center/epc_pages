When Banzan was walking through the Union Square greenmarket he overheard
a 
conversation between a vendor and his customer. 
       "Do you have chocolate mousse?" asked the customer. 
       "We have chocolate pudding," replied the vendor. 
       At these words Banzan became enlightened. <p><br>
