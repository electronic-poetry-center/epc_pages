1. "We'll build a little nest…" </font><p>

I'm following my client, Mr. Dominic. He's so capricious. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Claire<p>

He isn't really skinny. We just call him that. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Shirley Temple in <I>Dimples</I><p>

Easy on that jug, Son. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Walter Brennan in <I>My Darling Clementine</I><p>

Be my ghost. <p>

I heard a tiny voice coming from Dominic's stomach. <p>

bathed in the golden light of an Autumn afternoon<p>

Here you are and there you go. <p>

Always trust in Allah but tie up your camel. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Sindbad the Sailor<p>

Simply lift his tail to open his mouth. <p>

Maybe the Moon can talk but doesn't want to talk to them. <p>

"Give us lots of lucky breaks. That's what I want for Christmas." <p>

"Dad," asked Dominic, "why are there no actors like Neil Hamilton
anymore"?<p>

I need a fez. <p>

I'm not impressed by his advanced weinerheadism. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I interpret it differently: he's very delicate. <p>

<I>Use a Big Spoon</I><p>

Dominic was moving through a small space and fell hitting a chair's edge
with his upper lip near his nose. <p>

One million's enough for me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It aint for me - I'm a pig. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		Denise Darcel to Burt Lancaster in <I>Vera Cruz</I><p>

You were supposed to bust this guy, not join his cult! <p>

The auctioneer in <I>Return of the Bad Men</i> is the barker with the
chimp
dressed as a farmer in <I>Inherit the Wind,</I> the barker selling snake
oil in <I>Whispering Smith,</I> the barker of solid gold watches for a
dollar in <I>Guys and Dolls,</I> the barker for the Mermaid in <I>The
Unconquered,</I> and the barker for the shooting gallery in <I>Friendly
Persuasion.</I> <p>

They say of a two-faced person, "She eats saints and shits devils." <p>

That's pretty radical isn't it? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Yeah, but in a nice way. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Born</I><p>

I don't know but it feels like we're being pecked to death by ducks. <br>

	Charles Boyer to Joseph Cotten in <I>Gaslight</I><p>

You're a goat. <br>

"Isn't It Romantic" <p>

Good as bread. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Spanish saying<p>

What's the use of worrying about your beard if your head is about to be
taken? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	"Granddad" in <I>Seven Samurai</I><p>

He's a good kid. When he sees you sweeping, he brings you the dustpan. <p>

The Triangle Fire - 1911 - Manhattan<p>

Perhaps it's the pile of dark, gelatinous balls, which, to many, don't
exactly scream, "slurp me." <p>

Chaplin - <I>Five Keystone Shorts</I> - 1914 - something about a choice
between two things<p>

The Heart and the Mind - what an enigma. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Charlie Chaplin in <I>Limelight</I><p>

"The problem's right here," he said, tapping his forehead. <p>

"Looks like all he needs is a Lava Lamp and some sitar music." <p>
	
December 15 - Phantom smoke appears and disappears near the stove. We
continue eating as though nothing has happened. <p>

"Train Wreck" - that's your new name. How do you like it? <p>

December 16 - While Dominic eats dinner the kitchen chairs begin moving.
<p>

You've got something in your nose. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
It's oxygen. <p><br>

Pete, would you make me some cookies?  I love saying things like that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Claire<p>

In loving memory of children lost at sea. <p>

I smelled your spareribs and sauerkraut and had to come in. <br>

3. "And let the rest of the world go by."</font> <p>

Dominic fell over near the fence and began crying. I consoled him. At
lunch we noticed a red mark on his cheek. <p>

<I>Death and Other Problems</I><p>

When I arrived there I began to vomit, and as I was doing so I brought up
a hairy worm, a quarter of a cubit in length.  It was covered with long
hairs, and looked repulsive, spotted with various colors, green, black,
and red. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cellini, <i>The Life of Benvenuto Cellini</i><p>


This is Pete. He dances for nickels. <p>

Welcome to the Charnel House. <p>

Tie him to a stake at the water's edge and let the crabs eat his liver.

The toothbrush I saw on TV, the one that I wanted, is the one that I use

A la mode doesn't just mean "with ice cream," it also means "with
