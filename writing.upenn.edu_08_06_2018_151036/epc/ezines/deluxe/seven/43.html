Ten strophes derived from a passage in Gertrude Stein's play <i>Capital
Capitals (A Stein Reader,</i> [Evanston: Northwestern UP, 1993], 421–26
[the play's end]), by running it first through DIASTEX5, Charles O.
Hartman's most recent automation of one of my diastic reading-through
text-selection procedures, employing as "seed" a paragraph from <i>A Long
Gay Book</i> (<i>Reader,</i> 214, para. 7). In making this poem, 3 words
from the seed were inserted into the source passage before it was run
through DIASTEX5 to allow the program to complete one full period. <p>

Periods were added to that program's output, and it was then sent through
Hugh
Kenner and Joseph O'Rourke's program TRAVESTY, which was asked for an
order-4 "Travesty" of 2663 characters. Its output was revised in regard to
sentence breaks and sentence-final punctuation, but the words and neowords
and their order were left unchanged. Each sentence became a verse line and
these lines were grouped into strophes in which the numbers of lines in
succeeding strophes constituted two Lucas sequences: 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18,
29, followed by 1, 3, 4.<p>

421 and 214 are permutations of 241, found by opening a math-table book I
used in high school to a logarithm table. The extent of the source passage
was determined by random-digit chance operations as were the Travesty's
order number and number of characters. <p>

Every typographical line ending indicates a short pause, strophe breaks
somewhat longer ones. Periods and question marks call for sentence-final
intonation contours.<p>
