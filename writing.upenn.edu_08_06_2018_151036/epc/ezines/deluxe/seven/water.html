The sound of water <br> 
Sound of water <br> 
With a sound from the water <br> 
And the sound <br> 
The splash <br> 
The peaceful hush to break <br> 
The water sound!<br> 
Then is heard a splash <br> 
Hark, water's music!<br> 
The splash!<br> 
Then the splash <br> 
Splash!<br> 
The sound of the water!<br> 
And sleeping echoes wake <br> 
A splash of water <br> 
Water's sound <br> 
Plop!<br> 
A splash was heard <br> 
The sound of the water <br> 
The water's noise!<br> 
Water's noise!<br> 
Water's noise <br> 
Water's noise!<br> 
The sound of the water <br> 
The sound <br> 
GOES PLOP! <br> 
WATERSPLASH!<br> 
Water-sound <br> 
Water-sound <br> 
Sound of the water <br> 
With a splash!<br> 
Sound of water <br> 
Splash <br> 
The water's sound <br> 
Plop!<br> 
Lo, the sound of the water <br> 
SPLASH! <br> 
SILENCE AGAIN <br> 
The sound of the water <br> 
Splash! <br> 
Silence again <br> 
Sound of water <br> 
The sound of water <br> 
A deep resonance <br> 
Splinters silent air <br> 
Water-sound <br> 
Splash <br> 
SPLASH <br> 
Kdang!<br> 
Water-note <br> 
The water, and splash <br> 
The water's noise <br> 
Water's noise <br> 
Sound of water <br> 
And a splash <br> 
Water's sound <br> 
The sound of water <br> 
Splash!<br> 
With splash-splosh <br> 
The sound of water <br> 
Listen!<br> 
The sound of the water <br> 
The sound of the water <br> 
With a water-noise heard round the bog <br> 
Swoop!<br> 
The sound of the water <br> 
Sound of water!<br> 
The sound of the water <br> 
Water of sound <br> 
Do you say there is an echo?<br> 
The sound of a splash <br> 
Kerplunk!<br> 
Splashing the water <br> 
Water sound <br> 
Gigantic sound <br> 
The sound of water <br> 
The water's sound <br> 
Splash <br> 
A moment after, silence <br> 
The sound <br> 
Water sound <br> 
Ploomp!<br> 
Splash!<br> 
Plip/plop <br> 
Kersplat!<br> 
Blip!<br> 
Water-blip <br> 
Blip!<br> 
Blip/splat <br> 
Sound of water <br> 
Noises <br> 
With a little plop <br> 
Plop!<br> 
Splash <br> 
Plop!<br> 
Splash!<br> 
Splash!<br> 
The water: the sound of it<p>
