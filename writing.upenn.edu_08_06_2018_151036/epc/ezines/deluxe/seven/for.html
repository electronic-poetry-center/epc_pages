one boarder to another. a lowered ceiling or strange feeling in the
bathroom. the task & any medium may contain defects. there may be refunds
offered below. small print strong sense. a fifth of. freshly poured &
blocking the back lane. one & another one. rented cubes as part of the
activity. march in admirable order. planets. a striking white page
stroking hands. a shudder in every new car. penetrate the principal
sponsors & shoulder the small print. check again. a sentence searching for
a site. colonel lieutenant captain. the best you can do. the exhilarating
speed, e-text displayed. dishes on counters books in boxes. screwing. I
mention this history regarding my position. hands compare wounds, tar
stains. two leaks in two places.  a post & a fishing rod. one small hole
in one silk screen. <p>
