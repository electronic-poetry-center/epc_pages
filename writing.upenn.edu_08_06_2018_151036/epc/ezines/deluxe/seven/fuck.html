Gasan was sitting at the bedside of Tekisui three days before his
teacher's 
passing. Tekisui had already chosen Gasan as his successor. 
       A temple had recently burned down and Gasan was rebuilding it.
Tekisui asked 
him: "What are you going to do when the temple is rebuilt?" 
       "When you're better we want you to speak there," said Gasan. 
       "Suppose I die before then?" 
       "Then we'll find somebody else," replied Gasan. 
       "Suppose you can't get anybody?" said Tekisui. 
       Gasan answered loudly: "Don't ask such stupid questions. Just go
fuck yourself." <p><br>
