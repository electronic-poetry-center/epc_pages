was an old friend <br>
old old friend <br>
thought weren't - we that is <br>
friends anymore <br>
every fall <br>
picked up by 2 <br>
planets - perfect <br>
planets - revolv <br>
ing ‘round me - rough <br>
rough gravity - where fire <br>
was glow and ground <br>
had purpose <br>
too many tales in the pedestal <br>
foot - too many friends <br>
who leave me - to fall <br>
need to find <br>
my windowless ground - coarse <br>
opium - opiate cookie<p>
