<font size=6> THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD<br></font>

He always dreamt of a source <br>
and the source was here <br>
he dreamt of the profusion <br>
of smooth petals <br>
on days of festivities <br>
and the petals were here <br>
for his eyes for his hands <p>

He never ceased to scrutinize <br>
the mysterious wedding <br>
of earth and water in swamps <br>
and now he was contemplating <br>
the magnificent evidence <br>
of pure essence and upheaval <p>

He often sat in his youth <br>
on the edge of a wet slit <br>
observing its quivering <br>
its lively movements its traces <br>
and now he was leaning over <br>
the mother of slits <br>
listening for the rumbling <p>

He often caressed <br>
the skin of fruits <br>
with fingers full of desire <br>
but here the pulp was his <br>
rather than the skin <br>
in its glorious complicated <br>
abundance <p>
