The Bible clearly states that a proper rosary string also has a crucifix!
Because that's what the Bible clearly states! The bible clearly states
that God has killed millions of unborn children and infants. The Bible
clearly states that skateboarding is a SIN! The Bible clearly states that
entropy began well before the fall. I happen to believe that the Bible
clearly states that homosexuality is a sin. The Bible clearly states that
there is only one true God and that we are to Worship Him only. The Bible
clearly states that with God a day is as a thousand years and a thousand
years as a day. The Bible clearly states that one puff of marijuana, and
you're in league with Satan himself. The Bible clearly states that we are
to help those in need. The Bible clearly states that Jesus will come again
and judge all men. The Bible clearly states that all men will be present
for that judgment. But the Bible clearly states that all homosexual
behavior is sinful, and must be forsaken in the life of a Christian
believer. God's word, the Bible, clearly states that whether you go to
heaven or hell has nothing to do with who does good or bad. The Bible
clearly states that deceiving spirits are sent out into the world to lead
people away from a knowledge of God. The Bible clearly states that many
truths of the Christian faith were to be handed down by word of mouth. The
Bible clearly states that although many people claim to speak for God,
only a few really do. The Bible clearly states that Jesus is the head of
the church, and that it is not to be run by one man. The Bible clearly
states otherwise. In fact, the Bible clearly states that angels are "men"
or "people." The difference between the Reformed faith and less consistent
types of Christianity is that the Reformed faith does not argue or reason
against the supremacy of God, nor against what the Bible clearly states.
The Bible clearly states that every land animal and bird on the face of
the earth was wiped out (Genesis 6:7, 7:21-23). The Bible states clearly
that God created us with a purpose and thus each person is a special
creation made by the Almighty Himself. The Bible clearly states that if
any  unfaithful woman drinks of the Adultery Detecting Potion, her belly
will swell and her thighs will rot. The Bible clearly states that Jesus
kissed the feet of His apostles. The bible clearly states they'd only use
the money for cheap booze or illegal drugs. The Bible clearly states that
there is only one God. We know that Christ was doing the will of the
Father because the Bible clearly states this. Furthermore, the Bible
clearly states that it is "on account of the chosen ones" that the opening
phase of the great tribulation will be "cut short." In Romans 5:12 the
Bible clearly states that through one man sin entered into the world and
death through sin. As we have seen, while the Bible clearly states that
all Christians are priests, it said the same thing about the Israelites,
yet this did not prevent there from being a separate, ministerial
priesthood even before the Law of Moses was given. It is now 9 months and
10 days since the flood began -- The Bible clearly states that the Flood
covered the whole earth, it was not just a local flood as some believe.
The Bible clearly states in Romans 3:23 that all have sinned.  In l
Corinthians 14:33, the Bible clearly states that God is not the author of
confusion. The Bible clearly states that it is Jesus who gives the gifts
as he wills and that Jesus is the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit. While the
Bible clearly states that within Jesus' unique nature He was both fully
God and fully man; the cults disagree. The Bible however, clearly states
that the earth does not move. As the Bible clearly states, the devil will
gladly disguise himself as an "angel of light" in order to deceive
Christians (2 Cor 11:14). The Bible clearly states the age of the earth –
in the beginning (Genesis1:1).  The Bible clearly states that each person
must face judgment. The Bible clearly states that wealth or the power to
get wealth comes from God: De 8:18. Well, when it comes to abstaining from
compulsions, the Bible clearly states that fellowship, rather than
treatment, is the answer. The Bible clearly states that Moses fled from
Egypt to Midian, that he tended his flock in Midian, where Mt. Sinai was
located. The Bible clearly states Jesus will return immediately after the
great tribulation. The Bible clearly states that Mary was a virgin, and
that Jesus was conceived supernaturally by the Holy Spirit, not through
sexual intercourse. In stark contrast, the Bible clearly states that the
Lord of heaven made all things. Where the world says that there is no need
of salvation and redemption, the Bible clearly states that all people are
in need of deliverance from their sin. The Bible clearly states that God
"called" the animals to the ark. The Bible clearly states this in Genesis.
The Bible clearly states the roles of every family member and the
importance and significance of each. He claims that the Bible clearly
states that no man should pray to imagery, and he further announced that
God told him to knock over all graven images. The Bible clearly states
that legitimate earthly authority -- including the authority to tax --
should be obeyed. And The Bible clearly states that after having spent an
'eternity' in Hell, the rich man will be brought before God, where he will
be judged and sentenced to spend 'another' eternity in the lake of fire.
We believe the Bible clearly states that marriage is the only context for
sexual intimacy. But the Bible clearly states that no one lives on after
death. To use that reasoning would be to say that all sin must be
approved, for the Bible clearly states that we are all born with sinful
natures. The Bible clearly states certain absolute standards to follow in
life such as the Ten Commandments. The Bible clearly states that a great
Apostasy must occur before Christ's Second Coming. The bible clearly
states that the fathers are to be the head of the household. The Bible
clearly states in the very first chapter of Genesis, that God created the
stars to provide light at night. Galileo's opponents pointed out that the
Bible clearly states "the sun stood still, and the moon stayed" (Josh.
10:13). The Bible clearly states we do not know the day nor the hour. You
can search all you want; you won't find anywhere in the bible that clearly
states that angels have wings. <p>
