Source: User's Guide to Microsoft Publisher (1993)
Process: took employer's ID # off my 1999 W-2 form; broke up into various
one- or two-digit segments to generate page numbers.  Scanned the
designated pages in the user's guide for first word beginning with a "w,"
then counted +/- 2 words to generate a word bank.  I then arranged these
words in various orders, yielding a lovely, golden-brown pound cake…wait,
I mean, a poem. <p>
