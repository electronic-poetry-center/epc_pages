The Valla Problemata (FCLC Mix) - Gregory Vincent Saint Thomasino

Show me 
the geometer's points,
lines
& surfaces!
(nowhere to be found....)

Happy & beautiful & without thought of
daily-
affair....
(sometimes too palette pink & blue?)

The distance of lines & angles...
the shame & anger in the looks of
a man....

& How my blushing gladness
brrrrrrrrings....

V. practiced ventriloquism
by talking with figs in his mouth.
His wealthy father said, "That is impolite."
He thought to spit them out,
but thinking twice, he swallowed hard....

V. is doing Mahler,
V. is doing Liszt,
V. has little Timmy on his hip.
Timmy says all men are Finnegans,
and whiskey is the water o' life.
Timmy says the Irish have the gift of song.
(Why then are there no Irish composers?)

V. Knows the power of recaptured memory
V. Knows the satisfaction of the instinct
V. knows eternity, androgeny & the senses of Orlando
V. knows the science of the impossible
V. knows Charlotte Rampling & Dominique Sanda
V. knows Liliana Cavani & Oriana Fallaci
& all V.'s man's men are Hemingway

it is as the

again for the anonymous

the spectacularly so the

quiet or noisy suicides
to make their case
so attune us to

with each definition of

EXCISIONS - JOHN M. BENNETT

Does the comittee was its heads in a bloody sink?
Does the desk think of sand while it's burning?
Does the bathrobe sever its wrists in the freezer?
Does the basement sample its radon with an open
mouth?  Does the banker fester when its bratwurst
sweats?  In a sock?  Where the pages useless in
brine?  Does the chairman master her pens when the
windows sleep on the floor?  Does the shorn?  Does
the lip?  Does the arm with its curls of glass?

She Has a Good Head on Her Shoulders -  
Carolyn Steinhoff Smith


A bottle of vodka looms over you Seems
that nothing can beat it
A mind can't be tuned like a string
It isn't that your arm isn't alabaster
It's that this is the best life to rip open the bud and see how the petals
are folded into their brief case, what color they are
If they have beaks or tentacles
if they can assuage a stone without weight light as a spring
Day
Rope tying you to the dock of no imagination Your robe is the rope tying
you to the back of rolls for dinner Socks, breakfast flocks, born baby
unthinking, light as a weathervane
the ex poster boy of the not sewed up
free strapping is easy to say
but hard to do
"the arms" is hard to make out
But just stop at the sign
Stock still as the whistle of a train
kept in the dark by the congress
Until spring
When everything but your chair
Slides away
You are not loosed from the earth but still You are tied to a package
Her pipes have a mystical aura in candlelight, Brought about chiefly by a
letter
Requesting a donation to the so inclined foundation 
of Brighton County
by midight or we'll be swept away
on a tide of bees
Sent by God.
Who has ever heard of such things?
Out comes the admission
price of a ticket
Like the sun from behind a cloud tapestry: 
Yes, I whitewashed the clothesline
And the drier."
Some things cannot be bought.
Taking it into something holy
Flagrant violations of all pigs that talks over the back fence Root about
with dirt-caked snouts
Counting syllables like mushrooms,
Blackening her upper lip.

LULLABY - Robert Sward

Rockabye dust
in the mourning cradle,

from STANZAS FROM DJERASSI - Jack Foley

what reason do we have
to move
from one word to another?
(that is the point of "inspiration"--
the mind so agitates it doesn't question it just)
what does it mean to be
in a "radical openess"
in a state in which "I"
is nothing more than the "site"
in which these--
what, here, is "liberty"?--
However, it was not only among the mass of Athenian citizens that freedom
consciousness developed.  Slavery had rendered the independence of the mass
of
native Greeks possible, not only by making them a leisure or idle class, as
was once
naively thought, but by making their independence tolerable to their former
masters by providing them with an alternative, more flexible labor force.
Cleisthenes, who had been on the loosing side in an intra-elite squabble,
"took
the people into his party," people whom he had "previously held in contempt."
This is where the situation stood at the turn of the fifth century B.C.   It
was
a tense moment in the history of freedom, in consciouness of it, and in the
very
language used to convey it.  But it was a tension pregnant with enormous
possibilities. Bringing the whole thing to fulfilment, the very birth pangs
of
freedon, so to speak, were the Persian Wars.
Dream-
time, she said,
and climbed into bed.
Lady of pain, lady beloved of Swinburne,
writing verses on his way to be floged,
are you here
do you conduct
us to the "underworld"?
is it your dream that admonishes?
is it you we admire in this
                living landscape?
is it you who open your legs to the "thrust" of freedom?

 [(editors note: the excerpt below follows several pages after the above
excerpt)]

These 
are the flowers
that grow here
"This is a good place to work because one is away from various distractions
 (including,
certainly, The Telephone) but one feels also a certain sense of
exile
from one's life.   I like  my life."

These
are the elegiac possibilities
that define this place
"my daughter's lovely     face
bloated
in death"
some deep failure
at the edge
of energy

energy is eternal delight
in Lou Harrison's music
light
turns into
sound
as she described the
landscape
I could sense
her
music
a continual
transformation
of visual
experience
into auditory
experience
a continual
transfiguration

             FLESH PEDALS ASS OVER SPEECH-SYNTHESIS  - John Noto

Steam-heat cored from the urge transceiver
becomes the awning of your depest vision,
is lipped and gorged at the abs, and fleshed
vents exhale microdots; slouch your jeans down cool-
you're dancing the deton-atrix;

Now, the silicone crypt drag-coefficient swings,
inches, pours tongue-relief figures
on the small of your back, a drop in bounce light
puddles caption, cues my scan language rolling the credits
and a web-snake fades in the dub;
                    hit me on the numbers;

Coloring the scorchways along your ribs'
lace apron, I record a spindle-grip opening,
panels in the Earth's cowl; stones, debris, sweat beads
fall through the Y, a film duct in the heat of prey,
stalk, shape-changer on heels,
                  the boogie-matic;

Weathering, I phone up the read-only
banked facial-belief agancy, eviscerate and re-stoke
your life-line, long, wide-open palms on the sharp
edge of a steak map we switched furtively.
for brushed steel organs,
                                           the grey corpse moon
slurred on a musular wrecking crane;

A swathe of embedded-glass initials, slashed
on the arms of the scaffold, lag-time children
call in and out on the hollow form you wove
to heal flayed human hair,

And when transclavicle Ergs and snapdragons
vie for the scruffs of our necks, we will throw
into a season of abused privileges, smart-grab
the lurching master-tape well ahead of clock time,
                                                                    juice,

When I was older, I bite my mother's hand. I bite her. Hard.
She creied and cried and cried. I Guilt. I Guilt. I Guilt.

The first thing he said to me was: "Your hair don't smell like
coconuts no more." To which I replied: "I'm older, the coconuts
