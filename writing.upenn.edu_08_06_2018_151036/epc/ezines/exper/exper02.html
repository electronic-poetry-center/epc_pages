Welcome to the second issue of The Experperioddicist - electronic.
Still trying to get the hang of it, and looking for new connexions, means of
distribution. This issue will be a little longer than last, but still
hopefully a quick download. Eventually, as the net becomes more graphic
friendly, we will incorporate visuals and sounds and a chorus line, but for
now it's voodoo in ASCII. The post address is: 9th St. Laboratories
P.O.Box 3112
Florence, AL 35630
should you want to send something via that route.
Here's all the new mojo:

****************************************
MANIFESTO OF NEGATIVITY by Harry Polkinhorn
(soon to published in The Experioddicist - print version)

1. Prescript: I have nothing to say.

2. Nothing counts any more; nothing ever did.

3. Culture is dead. It committed suicide because it had become succeccful.

4. The liberation of language, a poetics of freedom of the word, the
Futurists' parole in liberta, the jouissace of schizophrenic dicourse, the
transrational zaum of the Russians, all fit perfectly into their preordained
boxes, gagging them forever.

5. The violence of pure heterology runs rampant in the streets.

6. Poetry has no impact on people. Right when they think it does, they are
furtherest from its transmuting power, to which the weak look back in
nostalgia.

7. Personhood is fictional.

8. There is no synaesthesia right around the corner to bail us out.

9. Only the foolish believe that technology has an autonomous status. They
rush into its arms expecting salvation and find only their asphyxiation.

10. In a zero-state world, you can't go on vacation any more.

11. All the so-called great achievements of our generation are nothing; you
can't distinguish between "them" and the versions of them we are force-fed.

12. The artist has no public. The audience is bought and paid for.

13. After Auschwitz, poetry was written, but it might as well not have been.

14. At the extreme end of representation, nothing remains, or what is left is
precisely that: remains.

15. The apotheosis of display ends up where it started: with less value than
that of a bad joke.

16. Our only chance is total denial.

17. Language is nothing more than a running back and forth.

18. Nihil obstat everything.

19. The king is dead.

20. Integration: all previous manifestoes are hereby declared null and void.

SLEEPING DOGS
by Carolyn Steinhoff Smith

Let sleeping pigs fly
into the dogpen
I run out of
        barks        barks
run out of me
I need everything but you
          Willem
Your brush so wide
Your bride so lush
And bountiful and beyond repair
thought the pear,
spokewoman on the porch
with presents on her mind:
"Am I going to get something?"
Their dogleg street lifts itself
over the highway
     .  .   . that their masks
and costumes are just precious
in Vinyl Man's presence.
Dogleg street life presents .  .  .
The utter stillness of a bath.

ISNOWTHE by Jim Leftwich

The tattoo moves. Spin riddles, night's spiracle, pirouette of sihouettes.
Along a mobius strip in which all depths are brought to the surface, all
surfaces fall to depths. Revet vatic algebra, caravel in wicker curl, beetle
webbed in reel. Wall above raceme, lucent ledge of weave, ludic wind. Blur
wreathes flash of feast in coil. Tribal rite spins silence. Writing from the
ridden, brittle, mobile briars, death's wrist.

Strand of nod, strain spider's eye through aperture, suffuse fish. Ooze of
clocks across the limen into endorphins' image. Reinventing the numen, the
corporation, oval aura around each item, repackaging the process. Place of
the skull, voodoo tattoo. Fecal pistol throat. Hydration of the depths,
alchemy of oil and death. Morphine of rain, a rhapsody. Age of silent
tension.

Performance, gristle of the nation, hours of toxic collaboration. Coiled
economics, wrath of the wrench. Currency of the eaten, coverge on anger,
allotropes of aphasia. Erase Eros, event the east, soil is money, sold in
phrases, lunar oil. Urgent missle plastics, bouleversement. Is now the
convent of intentions. Swim the boils of breath. Cesspool of the holy, silver
blood, empty flayed intestine.

Fecal bloom, jejune. Between form and transformation, chemiluminescent,
content gets you across. Bitten fractions, sea circles. Now is the artifice,
convex mentation. Snow in the sinews hones honest nests, ait of nits, newn
histone, histology of noise. Its unmade sheets are the dawn of things.
Fractal frit, alar ilia, night measured as lack of nits. Knowing changes.

                     Real absence based on expert amnesia, experience no
question. Open that. Absolve pervasive direction, regarded as independent,
breath's circumstance, practcal source of adverbs, parched voice of circled
stances, open grave greater than oval zero, light shallow subject, glass body
rubbed, origins of the gymnosophist's orisons. Less shadow lakes than lather,
toxic serpent's udder, visceral flesh. Annihilate body with person, bloody as
dispersal, the beach can wait. Lyric is belief in the impossible. Airt
glossed by lac, lost in the runes' wound, trial encompassed trail. Sexual
property crazed by desire, apostrophe without form.

Perdition of miracle, theif in the chasuble, the infinite is a ternary
essence. Withered form, catastrophic, lotion's ship. The sine sings. A
possible building denounced by missing floors, singed sighs, several spectral
propositions, now is the direction, regal as in Detroit, art's fiscal
circumcision, Essene, terror of final senses, fatal aquiescence. Suspire,
suspect pyre, pectoral signal, silence is oval. Pelvic altar, note no
question, precise, real absence, known incision. Experiential adverb, slowly
the stream of letters settled into a line. Silent reverb roses add, tactical
source of philanthropy greater than bosons.

The parrotfish sleeps in a clear bubble of mucus. Horizon's gaseous body,
rubbed origins, sexual debts sire sand, efface sun ship. Horizon as a verb,
the hidden face of desire. Eros the goddess of dawn, neither lisp nor
metathesis, face the shade of eosin. This is an apostrophe denounced by
missing form, turning away from wish. This is the double heart of the lost
wall. From strophe to apostle, by perposition sent. Without a plausible will,
sing now, the art of cecal doors, love no quest, shun floors.

Insert opaque erotic data. Poetry is made in bed like love. Opal roils,
insurrection. Name whines on the mesa, offal riots, empty resurrection, dates
eaten, carnal plates. Precise source of a direction, perfuse chyme. This sort
of a sentence, opaque sesame. A statement that proclaims the long vowels it
contains. Thistle snort issues pittance, rub alters rose.

                          Detect the horse convection, convention's text is
fiction. Regal gala lasts in detriment of real absence. Drug dung, oval
obsolescence. The smallest possible circle, the circle become a dot.
Circumvent able stances based on practice, adverse experiments, the adverb
advertises place, time is its expression. Greyer than light and shadow, below
brujo, shallow hero mesa, I Ching, therefore za um, sone beyondsense. In the
sexual body, since beyond several, pizza oom, razed metoscopy. Origins
annihilate horizons, a person's will as property, buy desire's apostrophe.

Silence is an opal, pelvic mesa, eye is spine. Verbal ampere, fire in spoor,
fever bites, slyph wine. Open oval roses, drag text box into trash. Compass
nutation, somatic paliimpsest. Apocalyptic stroll, liasons can wait, licit
wall of tissue. Relationships without form a possible building. Announced as
missing floors. Epact precession.

excerpt from STANZAS FROM DJERASSI (for lou harrison)
by Jack Foley

Letters
float down among us
from "sky"

and say
words
"snow"    "piss"    "cat"    "euthanasia"

It's possible you know
it could be
branches


                          what are these words
                          what can be done with them
                           "elucidations"

Language


I held my hands in front of me


                          what about these words
                          what about
                          them



what reason do we have
to move
from one word to another?
(that is the point of "inspiration"--
the mind so agitated it doesn't question it just)
what does it mean to be
in a "radical openness"
in a state in which "I"
is nothing more than the "site"
in which these--
what, here, is "liberty"?--
However, it was not only among the mass of Athenian citizens that freedom
consciousness developed.  Slavery had rendered the independence of the mass
of native Greeks possible, not by making them a leisure or idle class, as was
once naively thought, but by making their independence tolerable to their
former masters by providing them with an alternative, more flexible labor
force. Cleisthenes, who had been on the losing side in an intra-elite
squabble, "took the people into his party," people whom he had "previously
held in contempt." This is where the situation stood at the turn of the fifth
century B.C.  It was a tense moment in the history of freedom, in
consciousness of it, and in the very language used to convey it.  But it was
a tension pregnant with enormous possibilities. Bringing the whole thing to
fulfilment, the very birth pangs of freedom, so to speak, were the Persian
Wars.
Dream-
time, she said,
and climbed into bed.
Lady of pain, lady beloved of Swinburne,
writing verses on his way to be flogged,
are You here
do You conduct
us to the "underworld"?
is it Your dream that admonishes?
is it You we admire in this
              living landscape?
is it you who open your legs to the "thrust" of freedom?




a slow-moving, meditative poetry
something appropriate to your age
and circumstances

"nothing too much"
written in groups of three
(partly to demonstrate its status as "poetry"
and partly in reference to the great Italian, Dante,
vwhose rhyme scheme will not, however, be
attempted)

a slow, "wise," thoughful medium
which does not seek to shock by language
content or any other means

a steady
drip
of poetry

-is not exactly what we wish for here
(Violence, said the film director, I'm against violence!
But did you expect me to make a dull movie?)

meditative

verse     (bleah)



--After an experience imagining himself to be a FLY moving around in a room,
Tobey was able to develop a kind of multiple space, a personal version of
cubism, in which the viewer has no fixed perspective, but finds that his eyes
wander through the painting as though viewing a three-dimensional object from
many angles. . . 'I have sought to make my painting 'whole' but to attain
this I have used a whirling mass.  I take up no definite position. Maybe this
explains someones's remark while looking at one of my paintings:

                                    'Where is the center?' "

"You are as a dead thing living...
O! remain not by the fountain of Human Sorrow;
The joy others seek, are not for you.
Return! Return! unto the worlds from whence you came!"

language like Yeats' --fin de siecle  (but it is fin de siecle again)
death-longing--death as the erotic--
v"delight becomes death-longing if all longing else be vain"--
Return to what? To nothingness? But perhaps for Tobey it is a return to
light--
Magnificiant paintings:  "Where is the center?"
How does one deal with the death of a child?
The mind which circles in "multiple space," longing, centerless, returns to
that black hole ("as though viewing a three-dimensional object from many
angles") returns with a deadening fierce oppressiveness (how does one get it?
 how does one get beyond it?)  
  "O! remain not by the fountain of Human Sorrow; / "Return! Return!"      
  "All human beings are responsible to each other and the lack of this
consciousness creates within communities restrictions and differences, for
which the community as a whole pays the price of less expansion.  Society as
a whole has shut the door to the artist and creative person because they have
individually and collectively shut the door to their own creative sides.
 Feeling people are too difficult and demand too much individual thought and
time for the routine of their factual existence.  When people of any
community learn that art may become a functional part of their life they will
find more life and not only that but a new eye and a new ear--and the artist
will step down from his ivory tower only too glad to become a part of the
whole again and both will come to see these and similar activities as
manifestations of   



                                                                     spirit."
