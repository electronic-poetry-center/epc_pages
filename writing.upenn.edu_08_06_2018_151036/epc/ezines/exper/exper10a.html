excerpt from PAGE 119
       JOE SPEER
I built a fire in the middle of the street using boards from one of the
buildings as fuel.  The sky was filled with stars.  Electricity and stars are
not compatible.  In urban areas the stars are dispersed by the glowing earth.
 Only in rural or wilderness areas do stars reveal their pin points of light
as if to counterbalance the surrounding darkness of the earth.  I saw
patterns beyond Orion and the Big Dipper.  I saw Philip Whalen on a bear's
head practicing Zen Buddism.  I saw Michael McClure as a shaman activist
reading slowly at Point Lobos something you may tell to your children.  I saw
Ed Sanders getting politically vocal with The Fugs.  I saw Bob Kaufman eating
a golden sardine in silence.  I saw Gregory Corso pouring gasoline on the
vestal lady.  I saw Anne Waldman praying at St Mark's Church for a
disembodied project.  I saw Lew Welch disappear into the mountains.  Lew!
 Don't take that gun.

        BABY'S IN BLACK
             Michael McClure

THE NIGHT HYMNS BRIGHT THOUGHTS in Baby's contemplation.
His fists beat and toes clench. His voice
wails terror of the crocodiles
         beneath the bed
         but he's in silence.     Screaming is
         only in his head while moths
         die at the windowsill.  The ice wagon
         loads up and the horse is harnessed
         for the daily trudge through
                North Seattle

                    --like
                    the smell of cinnamon
                    and nutmeg
                it never goes away!

                  I
                am

           this hungry thing

               DESPITE
            the collapse
          of six dimensions,

      lying by the fire and smelling
          granpa's snuff and cedar kindling,
          listening
          to the crackle,

      DON'T TELL ME THIS IS REAL!

    Letter 9.12.95
         Jim Whizz

Rev.,
     So good to hear your voice last night. Were in interesting times now
with the gravity moon phase retreating with our magical prowess being
swallowed up like a foaming rootbeer float. The cosmic mama playinbg the
trickster in a hide & seek game of visionary seclusion, gritting my teeth as
bugs splatter against $3 sunglasses from New Orleans, the smile remaining
'cause dats what da Dalai Lama His Holiness said to do. I trust the cat, down
on (to) earth, one of five point six billion in the human family. So when the
conflict comes, through compassion and dialog we can solve all the problems
amongst the human/monkey kingdom. Sounded like good advice, can't wait to
take off on the bike to the mountians and commune with nature. A performance
tonight, dancers, poets, singers, musicians, "entertain". The monkey grinder
churns his meal out with a frozen smile gazing blankly into his own
reflection as passerbys turn their heads to the rythmic stride of high school
girls playing hookey.
                                              Drinking the blood of
simplicity,
                                                           Jim

We stare at the entire 19th Century which flashes before us like a movie or
perhaps is  a movie.  Memory is notoriously unreliable--we fictionalize--but
we fictionalize in writing too, creating orders which were not--Writing is
exile--Whoa, not so fast there--Authority--Objectivity--all that topples as
if it were not and in a way it is not--The present shifts so quickly we
cannot get hold of it--The past is "present" only as a construct--The future
shoots its unknowable shaft, piercing our barely cognizant consciousness--And
in all this our mouths agape--We act and acts have consequences--Murder will
out--but at the expense of order, at the expense of but at the expense of at
the expense of but at the expense of--reality--Writing is exile --

native messenger whalloped from behind by wind

Pluto roars January as accomplice to initiate
New Year welcomed from within a ringing bell
protected by a lion breathing into the mouth of Horus
curling flame of burning fatwood
natural master releasing the verbhouti and churned cream

How many returned ones are burning

  death of the one self

children performing divinations on one knee
carpets of rice and red sand define the universe
 a giant sun

frozen in seeking

CARTOLINI VENEZIANI 
      Neeli Cherkovski

I

living signs--bursting forms--Titian hallways--what dreams
broke out of form--wading through ethereal backstreets, crossing
a bridge/beautiful explosive silence of stone--to the palace
where Love might be preserved--to the place where poems
take form--these words to be ignited. . .

II

weapons stacked in underground corridors
violent enemies of the trees--these seabirds scatter
when dawn walks steadily forward, the mosaic of medieval
religion, a shooting star--lost steps at long last--there she
lies who would make Love into a form. . .cathedral-like
dominant, tower or perhaps a walkway leading
to the green ocean's yawning mouth. . .

III

how cold at the jetty's end--nostalgic peaks--blind luck
filling crevices--dim faces peering from behind darkened
windows--a door opens, a pair of lips make comic gestures
--steps fall hard--here gods and goddesses
gorged--now only a painting in a waiting room, war, glory,
commercial arms spread throughout the Mediterranean
immolation, a world gone mad, or blind. . .

IV

and you are not sure, but you awaken, it really is hotel california
near to the train station--there had been snow on the Alps
and a band marching backwards in the dining car--angels
in wretched streets where muses had once ruled
or so it has been written--the angry paint of an old man
dying to be heard, dying to remain even as the light
was closing, even as time stood to be annihilated. . .

V

these men on canvas as cafes roll open their doors--pigeons
cover San Marco Square--the signs are real enough,
another sad night will pass, the glorious bugles live only
in dream-time--these lonely and lovely eyes remain, seasound
rises--madness might reign-in the elements--a boat goes
slowly by, under the Bridge of Sighs--

VI

the city dries out--two days of continual rain--high wind and
no mercy for those who cling to the form--there are men
drinking in the nearby bar, San Marco has all the elements
of a caravan wending its way through another world--here
are the relics of time--where is the constituency for these songs
that glow out of the deceptive Venetian countenance?

VII

glowing quarter of the Jews, ease into the Talmudic ripple
and show no mercy, stone lions oblivious to suppliant's cry--
gloved hand awaits water--lions roar--droning music
a form insensate appears--groaning eyes of stone leap as trumpeters
writhe in headless sleep--rough edges melt, contract, seize
the dead who awaken at dawn--virtuous lions praise
a turmoil of prayer and hourly devotion--Venice glows
and becomes water at last. . .

Larger smoothes the righter corner of what
you see by turns repetitive and unique.
Original size attains its recall, the forward
push of sign & time no longer heals the light.

Long enough today, too, to say you are forgotten
from the earlier stuff, what was it, an 
invasion from within, denying the present its
fresh vigor and original, unspoken purpose.

Broken arrows do not decide the fate of nations,
who would even comment on that is not
no foreign sunsets the mirror'd heart in
its own heat beats the moon around the sky.

Arc & shine, familiar projects.  Yarded-out.  And
the slimmer doors, a tunnel reign, or stammer
or co-rental in the season's own benign to tell,
her's as the moving sign; awaitment has no passage.

Floors to pour.  I'd wrestle signs, their own density
a promise or a spasm, either calls away your
own denial to storm or toss yr lunch.  At flat.
Moulted shin, hero at doubt,  re-lighter from within.

Or boundaried-out, what held former lines exists
no more.  Partitions have a way of waning.

II

Your dick: at said, he dreams her on the wall next
to him, nude by candlelight, energy streaming from 
within at a finger's touch, and music singing
in the background of the evening's heated ways.

I called disaster, but it didn't answer.  My luck.
