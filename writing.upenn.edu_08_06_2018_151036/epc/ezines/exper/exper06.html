Welcome to THE EXPERIODDICIST #6. In several instances, as in Michael
Basinki's and Jack Foley's poetry the lines that were too long to get in the
small screen window I have been forced to indent on the line following. I
have tried to do this in such a way that it would be obvious while disturbing
the flow and appearence of the poem as little as possible.  Eventually we
will be able to move to a larger screen, but until then the poems may not
appear here exactly as they did on the page. (There are also instances,
especially in Jack Foley's poetry, where, due to the limitations of ASC II
and the cross formatting required over the internet, empasis such as boldface
type or italics, could not be included. Anyone desiring a copy of that
material as intened on the page can obtain it by request and a seld-addressed
stamped envelope to the address below.) Apologies to the poets.
Feel free to contact me here or at P.O.Box 3112, Florence, AL 35630 Hope you
enjoy this month's issue.

POSTYPOGRAPHICAL
 
Literature created beyond the limits
of the Gutenberg Galaxy
                                                       by Fabio Doctorovich
 
The publishing industry has remained virtually unchanged since 1455 when
Gutenberg first printed the Bible. Now, we are assisting to the most
important technological transformation in literature since the invention of
the printing press: the Gutenberg Galaxy is starting to disintegrate into a
myriad of small postypographical nebulas: the McLuhan Entropic Galaxy. At
this point, the printing press is being complemented -not YET substituted- by
a number of other publishing technologies such as audio recordings (in the
form of sound poetry and audio books), computer media (CD-ROMs, electronic
networks and computer art), videotaping, and others. On the other hand, old
"literary" techniques as for example singing and acting are being revamped by
performance and sound poetry (both of them frequently using technological
refinements as well). Not only the publishing industry, but also the act of
reading, unchanged for
several centuries, is being altered. In the case of compute CD-ROMs, reading
has become an active, participant directed
process rather than passive, author directed: turning pages in a book has
been transformed into following hypertext links. The rational- visual act of
reading has become an experience of sight,
sounds, and colors. In the case of performance poetry, reading (a lonely act
with a slow asynchronous response by the readers) mutates into a collective
experience (a social action in which the answer of the public is received in
an immediate and synchronized manner).
As it would seem obvious, the writing techniques are also being profoundly
altered. The writer of the not-so-distant future will have to be a
morecomplete and unespecialized artist that will need to blend his writing
skills with oral and visual artistic abilities and even technological
knowledge. This, together with a literature that allows an active
participatory reading and even the introduction of modifications made by the
reader in the work of art, will perhaps help to rehumanize literature and
achieve the avant-garde's unfulfilleddream of merging art and life.

Smilimile Limitude (an automatic script) by Ficus strangulensis

Ounce upon a time
doesn't rhyme
on your baby's lovely night.

Once so long ago that ounce wouldn't yet stick to pecker, a man and a woman
were born in warm, moulding sand.  And unto them came a freckled beast of a
great many legs.  The beast was and was not for it had the power of choice
and the knowing of all why.  In different times it would be a help but there
it only undid The shoddy.  From dawn to moonest or a little longer they
willed each another as was their pillar and stenched when it was
stenching time.  Delimiting the beast were again as many stripes and stitched
ribs as can be counted before puberty and after loss of innocents. As the
watchers felt, this left a greatly feared looseness in the otherwise
systematic nature of my worldlet.  Thus am i disbarred from the storage
building unless it is a rainy grey day.

an excerpt from "The Vampire Interlude" from STANZAS FROM DJERASSI (for
Norman Goldstein) by
Jack Foley

The vampire started. At this point he was unhappy (the mental fog of our
time). He hated me. He hated everything. I believe he was on his guard. Could
I have harmed him? Could I have (wrong) done him any injury at all (character
of the blunder involved in them).

Powerful
beings neither natural nor
super
natural (as I am)
driven (as I am)
by hatred (human beings are animals)
the task of detecting and exposing the fundamental error of the          
        misconception of the question
("you blundered," he shouted, "you fucked everuthing")"I," I said. "What are
you?" he said.  At this point 
the vamp
ire
strode furiously across the room, though he might have flown.   (I have seen
him fly; it is
an amazing sensation.)
"Vamp
ire,"
I said,  "What is the use of being close to you when such furies drive
          you?  No one can speak
to you then."
"This is story," he said, "I am story,  I am Vampire.  You are a fool.
          You have blundered.
                                            they are ruinous

                                we have family to trace

         framing them

this way and that

Here is a surface, say a plane surface. It has length and bredth, wouldn't
you say-- and it has two dimensions; next consider a solid, say a cube.  It
has length, breadth and thickness--and so it has, we say, three dimensions.
Now we notice that the cube has surface and so has certain surface
properties.  Do we, therefore, say that a solid is a surface; That the cube
is a member of the class of surfaces?  If we did, we should be
fools--type-confusing fools--dimension mixing fools.

Vamp
ire,
stay--
but he would not.  He disappeared.  I heard him urinate outside.
(these are
songs of degrees)
"Fuck," he said.   "What blundering.   I must feed."

Chris Mansel- 
from Archaic Confessions from the Gulag of the Dharma

  Rotted foreskin, stubborn eye following the glass as it falls from the
windowpane. The room has a high ceiling with elderly staircases that lead
nowhere. Swirls of pale colors reflect in the broken glass, distracting my
eyes from the motion of the air I cannot breathe. I close my eyes. Incest
ridden Cuban tansexuals fist fuck children into their own beat oriented ragas
where spiritualaility and religion blur into one. Child brides lactate
drowning themselves and their aged spouses willingly.
  It's hard to think farther than my wrists and knees, harder to think to see
your way past me. Suspicions are cast by mirrors in trembling hands. Short
breaths to quick steps, running to stand next to great men; her thighs trace
the brim only dulling the view. She looks over to me as I to her past you.
What she says and what she does are two equally separate and combined ways of
drifting interrogation of the senses.
  A subtle panther's breath over a dreamers eyes pulling at the
dream, the dream separates in pieces to circle the brain, one twists round my
legs and the other jumps through the base of the brain penetrating the skin
and surging into the panther's eyes. It stops there and becomes electric, the
dream for the first time exsists beyond the realm of imagination.
  Exhilaration is muted by a loss of limbs.
 A thin membrane nailed to the celing drips its many hallucinogenic juices
into parched swollen lips of my cock which rests between the floorboards of
the dance floor hoping and praying for a waltz.
  Circles concealed in squares corresponding to the others every ugly gesture
is what I see when I rest my weary head in the smooth lace curtain effect of
harmful prescribed medication.
  There's a mess of dead cooking to do. An atheist will eat anything.

CONFIDENTY LIQUID AT HALFTIME
gazing down upon you,

you're a lazy snake
across the plain, groping thru
treelines until out-of-sighting

lost tracks...
but beyond straight horizon's

the impending desert there
harbinge how you'll be

Robert Sward - EARTHQUAKE, 4-POSTER BED

             "Did the earth move?"
              "Yes, God-damn you. It moved."
                                     -For Whom The Bell Tolls

A dog shaking has a hold and won't let go.
Rumble, liquefaction, foreshock, foreplay
up down, east west, north south, shaking, "God, no!"

Giant earthquake monster Golden Gate, "Slow, oh slow,"
you sob, as this city, that city, falls away.
A dog shaking has a hold and won't let go.

"Oh, no, oh God, oh Cobra Dog, go slow."
You and your swetie crumbs in bed all day.
Up down, east west, north south, shaking, "God, no!"

Your Queen-size, four-poster raw steel bed rolls
over airhorns, flashlights and gourmet
freeze-dried cuisine. Up down, east west.  "Slow, oh slow."

Behind your fire-proof, Laura Ashley Palo Alto
side curtains, "Help's a comin', help's on the way," you say
reaching for espresso and the Sweet 'n Low.

This death-defying keeps you steady. You should know.
The world that ends is always. More's on the way.
A dog shaking has a hold and won't let go.
Up down, east west, north south, "Oh, no, oh God, go slow."

Alison Stateman - BEAUTY

BEAUTY        I want to hold it. Want to pick up a camcorder and record it.
Want to buy some new mascara and wear it. Buy a book on models and own it.
Pick up the perfect apple and shlack it. "Was she born with it or is it
Maybelline?" Men scale mountains, swim vast seas, cross deserts for it (or so
they sing). Freud just smoked cigars and Gigilos always drive red sports cars
(GQ had a cover story). The sign outside the house of fashion: "Abandon
Cofort Here." Priests in white robes are pretty. So are schoolgirls. The
actress discovered in the supermarket is prety, has a pretty story. Detective
on the evening news: "It wasn't pretty folks, not pretty at all." Lovers
often find each other beautiful, even when they're accused of murder.
"Anarchy has been let lose on the world, hemlines are simply everywhere!"
Crawford's dot is called a beauty mark, Gorbachev's a birthmark. This (?) is
a question mark. "He never should have touched the pale, white, rich, royal,
blond, blue-eyed, slim-thighed Elizabeth." The plastic surgeon and the woman
with laugh lines: A love story. Turns on a dime, on a lipstick, on a
lime-scented hair gel specially ordered. "Bread makes me fat." Augmentattion
of the breast for reasons of aesthetics, reduction for reasons of aesthetics.
This line for reasons of linear development. A mermaid has a fishy bottom,
she never wants to be photographed below the waist. Hillary Clinton refuses
any full-length photos. Hillary Clinton must be a mermaid. If a bus leaves
Clocksville at 3:34 p.m., traveling at a rate of 50 miles per hour and
another bus leaves Milltown an hour later, which one will get me to my hair
appoiontment on time? (Remember, no calculators may be used for this
exercise.) Dogs look like their owners. Owners look like their dogs. Chhose
Fido wisely. Lip liner, eye liner, brow liner, blush. Connect the dots and
please return seats to an upright position.

"One thing is likened to another

Invisable tv inviable milk
The Normal Heights sign "Eights"

Almost everything has gone wrong now
It is almost time to stop

The sky floats above us on a string
The sun hangs in a noose
a net of flesh

Sometimes a thing is made very clear
as though held to the sky
and turned  in the hands

like an imaginary woman
a yawning hand acts of opening

In this way something becomes clear
At dusk a light goes on behind a door
I am the light the door the dusk

The sun comes to a wall and burns out
The rest happens
and after that it is just the same

The crystal ball a ritual jewel
a glass eye
You look in it never looks away

A fixed pool
beautiful because of what it has forgotten

The eye a moon in a dirty sky
a dull star a flesh bag
