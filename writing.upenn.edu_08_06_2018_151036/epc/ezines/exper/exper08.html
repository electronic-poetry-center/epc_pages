POSTYPOGRAPHICAL
                                  Beyond the Gutenberg Galaxy
 
                                  By Fabio Doctorovich
                                  (f.doctor@chem-mail.gatech.edu)
        
THE RUTH AND MARVIN SACKNER ARCHIVE
   OF CONCRETE AND VISUAL POETRY
        
On that morning in Biscayne Bay, I was surrounded, spelled, minimized by the
impossible Sackner's archivehouse, the largest collection of verbovisual
imagery in the world -at least 35,000 books as well as 15,000 other works-. 
On that morning in Miami Beach I rang the bell, and when the door opened
there were no words to describe because words invaded me, subdued my
insignified visualpoetic soul and showed me with Their grandeur all the
colossal works I never created and never will be able to. NOT after the
Archive got into me with its power and fury. Their whole house -because the
Archive is the Sackner's home- has been conquered. Invaded from the ground
level living room to the first floor master bedroom and even the hallways and
bathrooms by written carpets and verbal paintings and worden clocks and
poetic sculptures and more and more: words, books, symbols, languages,
signifiers. LIKE A SYMBOLIC FOREST CONSTRUCTED BY A LEGION OF POETS. And I
should say: all we visually oriented poets shall visit that hexed house. But
I will say: we shall get bewitched by its energy and shall realize how
minuscule our works are in that context were the uncontrollable visualpower
of words and symbols manifests in all kinds of sizes and shapes, from the
microwritings of Enzo Miglietta to the huge Paul Laffoley's 5x18 feet Dante's
Divine Comedy triptych or the more-than-300-original pages of Tom Phillips'
transformation of a found Victorian novel: "A
Humument". And it was a retrospective exhibition of Tom Phillips' artworks
along with the "discovery" of Emmett Williams "Anthology of Concrete Poetry"
that would lead Ruth and Marvin Sackner to realize that those intriguing
fascinating works that they had been collecting for five years were
nothing else but visual poetry.  Of course, such an immense collection does
not include poetry only but also works that are better characterized as
visual art that involves the use of symbols of some kind. But then: who cares
about classifications when we can barely breath through that thick
verbovisual atmosphere, when we are euphorized, paralyzed, slenderized by the
sight and touch of those unattainable works?

ELEPHANT HEAD: OPENER OF DOORWAYS
              by Michael McClure

GREAT GANESH, WITH YOUR SINGLE TUSK
AND CONCH SHELL IN YOUR HAND,
                                       what is on the other side
       of the Blackness?
     What is not there in the non-dimensions,
      in the nothing stuff, when it is freed
      of the weight of our fistfull of senses?
What is the rosy musk of the other
        side of our eyes and brain
preceding the fantasy of quarks and the rivers of novae?

               GIVE
                  ME
                    A
         trillion senses

to bite it all like a blackberry 
      and find the seeds caught
           in my teeth.

When I spit, my sputum
           will be the colors of it.
     I know when I laugh
     it rings
     in 
     me.

the air is three times thicker; my metabolism makes you all
slow as the light shifting

cuneiform advertisements for weather balloon implants

          50 fathoms within             two mountains up

We would want our blessings without fat or radium,
we would want sleep to be sudden    deep    and educational,

TO INITIATE
   for MK
       by Steven Hirsch

Crack the Ouija master quiz of this life with
carnelian fob initial - melted wax to seal papyrus over
iron chain 
 sent to a strange pinespace on high mesa by
 destiny whiplash - 
native messenger whalloped from behind by wind
survival panic anger leads to

a hunger for wisdom in retreat, carry water
Dakini wields vajra tonic in a skullcup
Domo Arigato Onegaishimashta
Sake warms the bones - cools the mind
whatever fulfillment means is null and void.

Pluto roars January as accomplice to initiate
New Year welcomed from within a ringing bell
protected by a lion breathing into the mouth of Horus
curling flame of burning fatwood
natural master releasing the verbhouti and churned cream
of the listening hour.

How many returned ones are burning
in this purifying fire?
  death of the one self
by sculpted axe to initiate

children performing divinations on one knee
carpets of rice and red sand define the universe
 a giant sun
  blinks through
thin streaks of clouds
your heritage is gone again
the only returning
is to a path with heart
well worn, crunching over
leaf and needle on 
twilight mountain
frozen in seeking
to settle deeper in
to its valley suite

And I slide slightly as mud congeals to a more beige than gritty.  His alone
shines to a pulpy nearness made as mean as plantago.  A wily old lizard pouts
from nicked walls all the while being available for outrun-the-scryer matches
hastily convened in a shim warehouse.  Silly as sand.

        *****
A ladle hangs against nailed birch.  No pattern to the nailing or ever
canoes.  Musty to a trumpet sounding ropes' red.  Dragged back by force of
his will, a snail recoils in limp folds, climbing half-old grass unable fully
to appreciate his mass for being host to no mannerly creature.  The limit of
this behavior can be called sodden.  True, it begins as soon as
the rope be pulled and ends...  never.  My information can only approach
Truth from a position of entropy.

If kept truly to path marks as soon the vapors detect his foot markings, my
house a shell overhead.  A weight to be held.  A black tail from dust or the
kindly minister who played deadman come along.  Voiced more as question,
plain words infect my ear.  A surf of small objects, each definite but
altogether given as clues or for birth-pangs and daemon lists.
The handle can be sea cleaned as well the footguard be ahead of bucketing
loss.  Lost for days in circles at pins or cornered eyes, pulling from the
strengths characteristic of others' ideas.  His teaching lasted nearly a
minute as well as cliche.  A momentary circle could expand to include several
strands and cleanly forget even more.  Hums of leafy dinners persuaded her
family to continue the experiment even at no natural costing.

ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY
            by Michael Basinski

My first though on experimental poetry is that it is hardly experimental
enough. There is far too little pushing and pulling and manipulating of
literary boundaries in the realm of the poem. I think that this is the result
of poetic careerism. Some of our best and potentially brightest poets are
more concerned with prizes and photo sessions than poetic limits.
Experimental poetry is left to poetically positive outsiders, radicals, and
eccentrics, and to the poets from the working classes or from working-class
backgrounds. Fortunately, at this time this is a fantastically rich loom of
writers who are not rich or suburban in mentality. There are two veins of
progressive marginal writing. There are those working with the visual and
aural potential of poetry and those pushing the moral content of poetry -
that is, those engaged in writing about the body (particularly anything that
has to do with human sexuality). Interestingly, both of these forms of
writing are locating their audiences in an increasingly growing non-literary
community. That is to say , there are non-poets listening and reading poetry!
True, it is a small audience, but real, and it is now as it has not been in
the near past. Experimental poetry is therefore a populace event. People are
interested in it! Experimental poetry has made the poem again an exciting
experience. And it must continue to do so. It is something that titillates
the senses (as well as the mind). A poetry slam is as experimental in
presentation as a performance in a dark, obscure gallery. Experimental
poetry's mission is to engage the ordinary (this means ordinary people and
ordinary readers too!) and make poetry alive again to those beyond the
egg-head world of too much of modern poemitry.
