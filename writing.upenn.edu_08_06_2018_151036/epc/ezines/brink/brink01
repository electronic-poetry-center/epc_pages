<a name = "crane"><H2>CRANEFLY</h2>
<h3>By <a href="brink01#crane.biog">Helen Foster</a></h3>


What do I want with these <br>
membranous wings <br>
&#30;&#32;with their pretty rips <br>
that drip spectrums? <br>
They tremble. <br>
Am I Ariel then <br>
Or whispers from a room <br>
to meander crab-like <br>
 &#30;&#32;in fear of that blemish? <br>
So I cannot dance <br>
I am cold and colourful <br>
 &#30;&#32;ephemeral <br>
Agonised as a cranefly <br>
&#30;&#32; that leaves its brittle limbs in corners <br>
My erotic, eroding wings <br>
 &#30;&#32;without errand <br>
Their mechanisms cannot be explicit <br>
But they will fall away and I will <br>
sicken for them <br>
Or stick them back with other <br>
fallen parts <br>
Or pick up <br>
&#30;&#32; what I find <br>
I am overbalanced with feathers <br>
And the leathery years <br>
that leave their leaves <br>
&#30;&#32; lectures and <br>
mathematics <br>
&#30;&#32; without mercy <br>
Will leave me <br>
&#30;&#32; shivering <br>
Am I whispers from a room <br>
Or Ariel, then <br>
With my flaking wings? <br><hr></a>

Pressure made the most perfect newsreader and 
Swindon watched
her with a self-satisfied glow that pummelled the insides of his
core where an engine (a fairy embassy) throbbed like an old bus
- tickling from the coccyx all all all way up-spine imagism to
the mores between his shoulders. Pressure was in a shadowy
spiritual - imprisoned in ironies - in the thread of caves in
the shaft of mines the shape of smoke, dividing the abyss up
into lanes, announcing the death of Billie Holiday in a voice
close to the sweet haunt of trees slashed icy by lightening
while (her) mind stayed rooted - blind - an ascetic swoon curled
and for ever falling to the lawns of the planet far below. "The
Sun is usurped" said her fever. "Mis guided? Steer with your
hips" answered that automatic part of her that could copy Paul's
letters to Timothy in a fair hand while gaining the rest of the
news. The nattering of matter to matter was a consolation prize
for those not sharing in Conrad's awarded words in the  poem
which went "As space follows time/ so sleep follows wine/ and
every heaven is lost/ as any old Hell is refound./ Let this be
the corruption of fire/ the rot of comfort and/ rebuff of buffed
young minds". Swindon was disgusted by everything Conrad wrote.
He shouted it all down quite successfully but some lines wormed
their way into his elfin heart which was as sticky as a sucked
lolly and as scalded as a sea by the arctic moon. Already beside
himself with ruined images and 20th Century dreams lay the
letter from Worst Example and Pressure delivered its hidden text
within the hollowness of the syntax that wintered in the south
of the bulletin and summered east like a betrayed jewish ladder
leading from one comp any to another when the franchise
transmogrified - a little anaesthetic to compliment the numbness
induced by her 'not another fire in the cornfield'
near-but-not-neutral broadcasting tone: - "Dearest Uncle
Swindon. I know you are busy but I had to write. Yours. Worst
Example. P.S. The plot thickens just as a soup becometh broth
and just as top-heavy." Swindon got the message loud and clear
and he thanked Pressure with an austere wink.<P>

So the wound had not been sewn. The mini-skirt was all that
remained and the love of the  journey was not abated even when
such clear chances were missed - an opening goal remained
someone's cold thighs, the goalkeeper caught in his own net with
fishnet tights to keep warm when he wasn't missed. Swindon swore
with joy; he could cross worlds, cross swords, challenge the
porch light that said to him "It is night and humans live here
with their tornadoes." He piled his corners together to make a
sort of teetering barbican and waited for Pressure to come off
the air. Soon the birds would ripen and fruit would fly. Buffalo
would once more barge their way across the plains and lion-cubs
would play with the brownies; unless the botch clot ed and
blotted again. Even if Swindon mused the blotching inky blue to
block the milk in its thin stem - the pain sharp, like losing a
baby but gaining a staring roll any fairy would smoth er his own
mother for, (flashing chalk limelight patched or dangling on the
warp and weft of gardens parched and nature flooded with the
mess of a dead glacier - sloppy rocks stained yell ow by mustard
splinters under the silent terror of the naked sun - the scree
sews a sort of surface victory out of the spring - a mortal
thing desperate for love-music and a good dentist - witch hazel
- sluggish - moments of blame when his [Swindon's] flesh felt
like rotten wood that even the flame of remembered marriages
could not ignite) it could not amuse Conrad.<P>

For wasn't Swindon's past long and sharp? Wasn't it mused before
the muses could beck their  own demos? He had been born in the
age of Clay, the land of grunge only recently de-magnet ised.
The baby Swindon had been party to the control of nothingness
that had eventually lead to such tired understanding - even in
those so young. He had been schooled in the age of Glass and
learnt his antique fictions with all the other naughty (having
fun with nothing) fledglings. Humble bees danced about
horizontal islands glazed by the naughty sun while the sea
tranced a brusque throat between levels of navarho feelings.
Earthquakes - hunks of royal cake tremb ling and crumbling in
knowledge not yet inoculated with environmental innuendo.
Geysers and women with cameras whose backs wound up as a
whiplash scroll while individual method ology could only
crystallise - cast a gesture - implead instruments of torture
thrown open to the failure of rigged scepticism - heresy the
most basic seance pressured by steamy under-age  monism.
Tapering spirits his adolescence had been, in the age of
Chipboard, his intelligence clipped for clipping's sake trapping
him like a dragonfly in the wrong chronicle. Years of clench ed
fist followed his face into the age of Water Towers that in the
early morning wind crawled across the luxury of bleat bleat
history unushered. Beneath the rage of his tiny stack of voices
it was then that Swindon's mussels first propertied his fellow
creatures and tossed the lovebeads from heaven and coughed up
liquid breath - his own chest deceived by his own safetypin
heart. Now, in the age of Envisage he moved around like sand in
a box, dependant on the strangest human he could find all
because she reminded him of spicy afternoon. Survival was his
criminal scheme. Sedan-chair law was his big boss - Swindon
small-bottle, shaken down  and packing slowly. For death for a
fairy was analogous to an exceptionally long day at the races
that is cancelled at eleven that same morning.<P>

Pressure had learnt to clean herself like a cat. Her image
shone. Swindon played her well with a string of Billie Holidays
bought at off-season bargain prices.<P><hr>

<a name="tw"><h2>TERRIBLE WORK</h2>
<hr>
Terrible Work is a magazine of poetry, prose and opinion ranging from the 
dada, through expansionism and into the mainstream. Eclectic is the keyword of Terrible Workers, though T.W. is often too experimental for the armchair junkies, and too straight-forward for the drooling netbanger. Those of you who neatly slip between these two categories, while still encompassing them in your slipstream, may well be able to fully appreciate just how 'terrible' Terrible Work is. <hr>
Issue 4 is now available from: Tim Allen, Terrible Work, 21 Overton Gardens, Mannamead, Plymouth, Devon, PL3 5BX, U.K. Cheques or I.M.O.s for 3.00 pounds payable to 'Terrible Work'.

<a name="revels"><H2> The Master of the Revels </H2>
<H3> By <a href="brink01#revels.biog">Helen Foster</a> </H3>

The Master of the Revels <BR>
&#30;&#32;has declared himself important <BR>
Down the hall they dance to his tune <BR>
&#32;and do not stop <BR>
Disarmed <BR>
&#30;&#32;charmed <BR>
by that saurean tongue <BR>
He talks of thirst and thimbles <BR>
Then wastes his tears <BR> <BR>

A white sheep's jaw <BR>
in the green <BR>
orchard <BR>
nestles and<BR>
awkward it grins with me<BR>
and the greedy insects<BR>
laugh and rasp with me<BR>
at the sins<BR>
of the Master of the Revels<BR><BR>

I sit beside<BR>
&#30;&#32;baptised by fire<BR>
in the evening rain<BR>
The old yellow glow of the<BR>
window<BR>
screens the captive shadows<BR>
reeling.<BR><BR>

He opens his hands <BR>
&#30;&#32;they are flayed rats<BR>
and his coinage spills<BR>
like perfidy<BR>
on the sill.<BR><hr><b>[<a href="brink01#brink1">Back to Brink</a>]</b>
