<blockquote>
	The function of the traditional university is conservative.  It 
collects, archives, judges, and redistributes the culture hoard.  In times of 
stability, it works well.  It keeps track of every hint of innovation and 
tests it brutally.  Even most of the good ideas are found lacking.
<p>
	In times of dramatic change, however, the traditional university is 
worthless or worse than worthless, because first it  rejects precisely the new 
ideas and new knowledges that are required, and then, after change is 
unavoidable, it  opens itself more or less uncritically to every fad.  Once its 
tradition of wisdom is in question, it has no grounds for judgment.  In an 
important document from the 1960's, "On the Poverty of Student Life," an 
anonymous essay by members of the Situationist International and  students of 
the University of Strasbourg, we read:
<p>
<blockquote>
	Once upon a time the universities had a certain prestige; the 
	students persist in the belief that they are lucky to be there.  But 
	they came too late.  Their mechanical, specialized education is as 
	profoundly degraded (in relation to the former level of general 
	bourgeois culture) as their own intellectual level, because the 
	modern economic system demands a mass production of 
	uneducated students who have been rendered incapable of 
	thinking.  The university has  become an institutional 
	organization of the ignorance; "high culture" itself is being 
	degraded in the assembly-line production of professors, all of 
	whom are cretins and most of whom would get the bird from any 
	audience of highschoolers.
</blockquote>
	Since that time, students have come increasingly to doubt that they are 
privileged.  They have lost the sense of themselves as the producers of 
education and think they are consumers as they are consumers of everything 
else in their world. The institution accommodates them or even encourages 
their misconception.  Rather than teaching how to think, it offers an array of 
finished thoughts from which the students choose, as they choose from shoes.
<p>  
	The rapacious prosperity of the 50's and 60's was generated by the 
production of the immoral equivalent war and time in the world economy (the 
World War that began in 1914 never ended).  The  arms race had the dual effect 
of generating widespread prosperity in the West and eventually bankrupting 
the Soviet Union, now leaving the filthy rich in unopposed control of the 
world. "Ðthe world's 358 billionaires have a combined net worth of $760
billion, equal to that of the bottom 45 percent of the world's population" 
(Richard J. Barnet).  With the fear of a worldwide communist movement whipping 
up class hatred removed, the liberal concessions to the working-class and the 
poor are revoked.  The masses are controlled by an organized assault on the 
attentions by the media, drugs, fear of difference packaged as religion, 
misdirected education, and random law enforcement. The focus of consciousness 
is dulled and its continuity disrupted. It is thus not possible for the 
exploited even to recognize their exploitation or to have a language in which 
their dissatisfaction can be articulated.  Their self-expression, like every 
thing else, is sold to them in the form of talk radio,  gangsta rap, grunge 
rock, escapist movies, as well as all of the merchandise in the shopping mall. 
Underwear and chocolates are forms of self-expression. Consumption is the only 
sanctioned mode of identity.
<p>
	The world is now organized to serve the immortality of the billionaires 
or their children and grandchildren. The scenarios are numerous, most of them, 
like most sci-fi scenarios, no doubt too probable.
<p> 
	Consider: a century hence, when the earth is so polluted that the 
working stiffs of the world will be groggy with bad air and contaminated food 
and water, and the great artificial environments of the billionaires  will be 
in danger of breaking-down beyond the abilities of the impaired maintenance 
crews to fix them, the space ships of our cosmic imperialism will lift off, 
carrying the human genome as its pay-load; the billionaires will take off for 
the stars, leaving the rest of us the planet they have despoiled.  (See Frank 
J. Tipler, <i>The Physics of Immortality: Modern Cosmology, God, and the 
Resurrection of the Dead</i> , New York, 1994.  Tipler is a widely respected 
physicist, and his argument is posed as serious science.)
<p>
	Or consider:  a century hence, certain patents will confer rights of 
paternity, and Bill Gates will be declared the great-grandfather of a new super 
computer with a self-aware brain a hundred times more complex than the 
brains of its human progenitors. It will become the billionaire and take charge 
of the future of the evolution of complexity in the cosmos.  The ecological 
needs of  systems based on silicon are much less troublesome than the ecology 
of hydrocarbons.  (See Hans Moravec, <i>Mind Children: The Future of Robot 
and Human Intelligence</i>,  Cambridge, 1988.  Moravec is the director of the 
robotics lab at Carnegie-Mellon University.  He argues that we are at a crisis 
moment in the evolution of cosmic complexity and that humans will become 
obsolete within the next century.)
<p>
	These extrapolated futures are in the great western tradition of 
migration and despoilation that began some time before 1000 BC. All of the 
fresh starts on earth, all of the fresh starts for humans, have been 
squandered. This is our advantage.  We have lost our innocence. We are not 
Adam and Eve. <b>The Imaginary University</b> exists because those who 
matriculate produce it.  The students write all of the books in its library, 
plan the syllabi of the courses.  We examine ourselves, we confer our own 
certificates and degrees.
<p>
	Now those who educate themselves as posthumans begin to produce a 
nation. The course of study is difficult, the chances for graduation nil.  If 
you want to study and act, you will be welcome.  <i>Otherwise, please, stay at 
home and watch MTV</i>. You should know, however, that our Nation of 
Noise and Knowledge is at war with the United Nations and all of its members.  
You will be required to undertake dangerous missions.  The stakes could not be 
higher.
