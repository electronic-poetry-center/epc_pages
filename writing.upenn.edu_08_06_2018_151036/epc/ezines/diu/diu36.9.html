	The Habit of Synergy

	An energetic plumbed gap, awaiting. Something seeded in
	the head the initiation into imitation in a submissive voice
	the pleasure-text of this is making us slaves to leisure
	and each of our breathings is representative and ambiguous,
	a machine of varying degrees of uncertainty whose component
	parts are essentially forms of communication caught in culture-
	active tropisms to be treed and scryed and exercised,
	the feeling of being, aggressive intensity confused with
	optimism, lips a ruin, a map of damages basking in moonlight
	without prohibiting the situation, this illusory alternity
	inscribed on spiral vines, looped and lassoed. Freedom
	from insular occupation, a coil and a caul that contains
	the spinning as if from elsewhere a magnetic disturbance
	that calls to attention the memory server and orders
	a burst of visual purple that becomes its own associations
	at the same time inhabiting the image-nation of the other,
	connected to no greater power. The hook of sincerity
	and ambiguity dangles, fuzzy axes grappled as a ghost
	of itself climbs the walls and howls at the lightbulb,
	a sinuous shrill ululation suddenly of the moment,
	the habit of.

		Analysis of _Imagination Verses_
	     Jennifer Moxley (Tender Buttons, 1996)


        The poetics subculture may already be shell-shocked 
	by the rapid fire accolades launched from politically
	pois(on)ed pens in reference to Jennifer Moxley's re-
	cently published _Imagination Verses_.

	Sheltered and out of the range of misleading glorification,
	however, one comes to understand that such a body of work
	is more accepted because of the commendable grace with
	which it propogates a particular style, and that its worth
	lies more in the fact that it feeds a stream of writing
	whose continuation does much to strengthen the validity
	and power of its originators.

	The unfortunate yet not insurmountable weakness in this
	collection remains in its leaving the reader to conclude
	that the experiences referenced in the writing were merely
	imagined, and never actually lived.  With the notable ex-
	ceptions of "Wreath Of A Similar Year," "Lucky So And So,"
	and "Right To Remain Silent," the work depicts a writer 
	who like a leaf floats down a stream toward the river
	that gives it life.  Travelling further to the river's 
	mouth from which that life is expelled and into the sea--
	the womb that bears forth all--she does not seem to notice
	when the tree line disappears or when the current no longer
	gently swaddles her.  It is as if she does not feel the
	power of the tide or hear the waves that come to engulf her.  
	
	Moxley seems to place such a vast distance between her self
	and the object that it limits her sensory experience and
	her expression of it.  This assuredly has a dimming effect
	on the power of the work and shuts out its infinite cap-
	acity.

	Time frame, life's landscape, and creative potential are
	forced to wait within the work to expand, and for the poet
	to realize that the limits that poetry frustrates, as de-
	scribed in the book's Preface, are the only limits of one's
	own consciousness.  Poetry as an art will always more ef-
	ficiently approach the infinite possible when the mind is no 
	longer restricted, by the self, to building its bridges in
	"half measures."

	Many ears have been deafened by the droning choruses of
	media-mediated American culture.  Even the vision of artists,
	which has always been closer to the sacred, blurs.  So many
	that claim to be creators sit watching life beside everyone
	else as if they were on a sofa viewing an incidental screen
	over which they admittedly have no influence, feeling the
	distance, feeling the powerlessness, and accepting it in
	their minds.

	Moxley has visions of "Protest," of "calling in the new day,"
	but ultimately remains lost in her own "false hope factory,"
	seemingly unaware of her place in that great unravelling of
	light and dark, in burning through the wall that keeps one
	on the wayside.  Acknowledging such a position would bring
	shockingly rich depth and vital newness to her poetry.

	I believe in the skilful seeds that lie within these verses.
	I believe that in them exists a desire to become deeper
	translations of life.  I hear something in their despondency
	that continues to search; that will not leave hope forever,
	"blind as the first letter on the first stone written down."
	Or is it my own hope, that was not factory made, that comes 
	to stir these words, this poet, onward.

			Midrash for Castleman

Art, not always truth and not always the facts in the evidence of documents
in five or more pieces never, never goes the rime.  Not always pauses
in the moonlight or frost on fingers.  Never the moral equivalent of
the passive aggressive tender.  What happened to ruin the performance
of shadows?

The vision of Pound nibbling great and small Italians stays with me.  A
maggot of imagism, through the nations, and a fascist.  Ending as truth
in treason one more style of art to award ancient-looking and true.
It'll take forty more years for poets to affect recycled bleached clothes
rejecting his nifty coats and cravats.  The unindicted criminal, of the world
returning to Rapallo gave his fascist salute.

What roots in modern do you remember or rethink of those pilgrims
from America?

Counting pants in Truman's haberdashery; later Benjamin Weintroub
wrapping.  Then he became a publisher.

Castleman was told he should take a female name, a woman loving woman
name or a man loving man name.  That getting through the transom (with
universal air conditioning this may be archaic usage) was hardest for 
a man...I said, anyway (not wanting to disagree with advice) writing is one
enormous closet and he, Castleman, should not judge it too quickly.  He
wrote me that since he was safe and stubborn he took a hispanic name
and that succeeded enough.  I think somewhere he could be a female
and just wasn't telling me.

If poetry came in morality and in esthetics, and an occasional eccentric
hints-in-cooking (speculations on noodle kugel with the promise of
"taam") Castleman would be finished from the roots through the limb shade.

The boldest I read once was Kenneth Fearing "Strangers in Coney Island,"
when that's all you could find there, any season.  More like looking for
bullets in the armory.  The national condition of looking into the jaws
of the purpose in your sight.  Seeing.  Seeing unfolded answers.

This city has a non-danceable diamond ground.  Social security flounders
in trust.  With a cherry tree ax Lincoln split logs into union.
Invention is the necessity that is first planned and then elected equally
on Monday, after Saturday, after Sunday.  This guidance of the angel
of death by any means:  baseball in Donald Hall's view or from the border
city of Konion, Poland, the ceremonial sale of children to the richer
long livers who in the end are the cagey befuddlers of heaven.

If he was right Castleman would've been a woman loving woman.  Thanks-
giving preys are shaken together.  Only the still are forced to groom and
spray.  This is accessible poetry once-and-for-all.
