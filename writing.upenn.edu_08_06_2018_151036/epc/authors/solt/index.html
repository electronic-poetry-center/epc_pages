<p>Mary Ellen Solt was born in Gilmore City, Iowa, on
July 8, 1920 the first of four children of an immigrant Methodist
minister from Yorkshire, England, Arthur Bottom, and his American
wife, a former schoolteacher, Edith (Littell) Bottom. Until she
attended college at Iowa State Teacher&rsquo;s College (now University
of Northern Iowa),<b></b> where she was a friend and classmate of
Mona Van Duyn, Mary Ellen&rsquo;s creative pursuits were focused
on music. She possessed a passion for the piano. At the Teacher&rsquo;s
College an inspirational professor of literature, H. Willard
Reninger, first excited Mary Ellen about poetry, an interest
that would take precedence over the piano and dominate her creative
and professional life. In one of Reninger&rsquo;s seminars she
met her future husband, Leo F. Solt; they were married after
Leo&rsquo;s wartime service in the Navy, during which Mary Ellen
began her career as a teacher. After her marriage on December
22, 1946, Mary Ellen continued to teach school and earned a M.A.
in literature from the University of Iowa, Iowa City in 1948.
And after receiving her degree she moved to New York so that
her husband could pursue doctoral studies in English history
at Columbia University. While in New York, Mary Ellen taught
at the Bentley School and studied poetry at Columbia with Leonora
Speyer and at the Poetry Center with John Malcolm Brinnin and
Kimon Friar, among others. After Leo completed his Ph.D., Mary
Ellen moved with him to Amherst, Massachusetts where he had secured
a three-year teaching position at the University of Massachusetts.
During those three years (1952-1955), Mary Ellen gave birth to
two daughters, Catherine (1953) and Susan (1955), and continued
to work on her poetry. In 1955 Mary Ellen moved with her family
to Bloomington, Indiana, where Leo had been offered a job teaching
early modern English history at Indiana University. (During his
career at I.U., Leo served as Dean of the Graduate School ( 1978-87)
before his retirement in 1992.) Mary Ellen joined the I.U. faculty
in comparative literature in 1970. For the academic year 1976/77
she was invited to teach American poetry at the University of
Warsaw, Poland. This led her to assuming responsibilities as
Director of the Polish Studies Center at I.U. upon her return
to Bloomington, a post she held until 1984. For her service at
the Center on behalf of educational and cultural exchange, she
was awarded the &ldquo;Gold Badge of Order of Merit of the Polish
Council of State&rdquo; in 1981. Mary Ellen retired from Indiana
University in 1991 as professor emerita of comparative literature.
After Leo died in 1994, Mary Ellen moved to Santa Clarita, California
in 1996 to live with her daughter Susan, who was then Dean of
the School of Theater at the California Institute of the Arts. </p>
<p> Mary Ellen Solt was first recognized professionally for her
critical writing on William Carlos Williams. During her early
years in Bloomington she established a correspondence with the
older poet that became a close friendship until Williams&rsquo;s
death in 1963. Old and frail as he was, Williams came to Bloomington
in 1960 to hear Mary Ellen read what turned out to be a fairly
controversial paper, &ldquo;William Carlos Williams: The American
Idiom,&rdquo; for the School of Letters evening forum in the
summer of 1960. The paper won the Folio Prize for prose for that
year. Over the years, as the author of numerous articles and
essays, Mary Ellen Solt established herself as a leading critic
in the field of William Carlos Williams studies. On the occasion
of her retirement from teaching the Williams Carlos Williams
Society recognized her with a session held in her honor in Washington,
DC, in May of 1991. The last article she completed on Williams's
theory of poetry is entitled &ldquo;William Carlos Williams:
Idiom as Cultural Icon.&rdquo; Mary Ellen received a fellowship
from the national Endowment for the Humanities in support of
this project. Other Williams&rsquo; related publications include
the article: &ldquo;The American Idiom,&rdquo; (1983) and the
book: DEAR EZ; LETTERS FROM WCW TO EZRA POUND, COMMENTARY AND
NOTES (1985). </p>
<p> Mary Ellen&rsquo;s critical texts led her deeply into semiotic
theory, most particularly the writings of the American philosopher
Charles Sanders Peirce. An essay, &ldquo;Poems as Signs,&rdquo; is
a product of this interest. It is anchored by a comparative analysis
between a poem by William Wordsworth and a poem by her long-time
friend the Scottish poet Ian Hamilton Finlay. Two other essays
of a related nature precede this work: &ldquo;Charles Sanders
Peirce and Eugen Gromringer&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Concrete Poetry
as Sign&rdquo; (1982). Another related publication is ROBERT
LAX AND CONCRETE POETRY (1990). </p>
<p> Mary Ellen Solt is best known around the world as a concrete
poet, particularly as the author of FLOWERS IN CONCRETE (1966).
And as the editor of: <i> Concrete Poetry: A World View</i> (1968).
Her long introduction, &quot;A World Look at Concrete Poetry,&quot; is
a critical history of the movement. In an unpublished short essay,
WORDS AND SPACES (c. 1985), Mary Ellen Solt wrote: </p>
<p> <i>Concrete poetry invites us to consider words not only
as symbols that convey meanings but as things themselves...In
his long poem, PATERSON, the American poet William Carlos Williams
agonizes over his responsibility as a poet to clean up the words,
to revitalize a language divorced from meaning...Concrete poetry
asks us to look at the word: at its esthetic properties as a
composition of letters, each of which is a beautiful object in
its own right...Concrete poetry asks us to contemplate the relationship
of words to each other and the space they occupy. We must be
prepared to contemplate poems as constellations of words, as
ideograms, as word pictures, as permutational systems. By discovering
the meaning of the poem as it emerges from the method of its
composition, the reader becomes in some sense the poet. </i></p>
<p> Throughout her career Mary Ellen lectured extensively on
her poems and concrete poetry all over the world, as well as
conducted workshops and symposia. </p>
<p> In an ANTHOLOGY OF WOMEN POETS FROM ANTIQUITY TO NOW, editors
Aliki Barnstone and Willis Barnstone have this to say about her
career: </p>
<p> <i>[A]s a poet, [Mary Ellen Solt] is a pioneer theorist,
anthologist, and poet of the international concrete movement&mdash;no
one has contributed more to the diffusion of concrete poetry
in the United States and abroad&hellip; CONCRETE POETRY: A WORLD
VIEW (1968) [is] the most comprehensive anthology of concrete
poetry and theory. Her poems reveal far-reaching interests, from
moon rocketry to semiotics. As a sensitive observer of nature
and people, her impeccably crafted poems unite verbal and visual
arts in unique creations. </i></p>
<p> Mary Ellen Solt&rsquo;s visual poems (particularly &ldquo;Forsythia&rdquo;)
have been published in magazines and anthologies and many college
textbooks in Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Holland,
Germany (including <i>Der Speigel</i>), Poland, Latin America,
Japan and the United States (including <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>McCalls</i>,
and <i>Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar</i>). They have been exhibited in
museums and art galleries in most of these countries including:
La biennale de Venezia (1969); the Stedlijk Museum, Amsterdam
(1971); and The Jewish Museum, New York, (1970). </p>
<p> Her poems have appeared on television a number of times,
including CBS CAMERA THREE, May 12, 1974. Several of her poems&mdash;&ldquo;Forsythia,&rdquo; Touch,&rdquo; ZigZag,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
White Flower&rdquo;&mdash;have inspired works by artists in other
media (dance, music, film). </p>
<p> Mary Ellen Solt has published the following books and pamphlets
of her own poetry: FLOWERS IN CONCRETE (1966), A TRILOGY OF RAIN
(1970), THE PEOPLEMOVER 1968: A DEMONSTRATION POEM (1978), and
MARRIAGE: A CODE POEM (1976). </p>
<p> Mary Ellen Solt maintained an active correspondence with
other poets and writers. In a letter dated April 25, 1960, published
in the William Carlos Williams Review (Fall 1987), William Carlos
Williams wrote this to Mary Ellen Solt: &ldquo;Flossie read me
your poems this morning. They are excellent, they are so excellently
conceived that I do not trust myself to praise them&hellip; [Y]ou
have a conception of the poetic line which is revolutionary and
may lead you anywhere, with its implications&hellip;&rdquo; In
addition to her closest poet friends William Carlos Williams,
Ian Hamilton Finlay, Augusto and Haroldo de Campos, and Louis
Zukofsky, Mary Ellen was in correspondence with Robert Creeley,
Cid Corman, Denise Levertov, and George Oppen, among many others.
Over the years she amassed an extensive collection of concrete
and visual poetry. Her archive is housed at the Lilly Library
( Indiana University, Bloomington). </p>
<p> Mary Ellen Solt died peacefully, after several years of declining
health, of a stroke on June 21, 2007 at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial
Hospital, Santa Clarita, California, in the company of her daughters:
Catherine Solt, a health care professional in New York, NY and
Susan Solt, a feature film and theater producer and current faculty
member at CalArts who lives in Stevenson Ranch, CA. Mary Ellen
is also survived by her sister Margaret Jean Peterson of Iowa
City, IA. </p>
