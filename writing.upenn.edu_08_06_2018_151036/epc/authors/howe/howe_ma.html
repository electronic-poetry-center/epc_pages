      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;My 
        poems always seem to be concerned with history,&quot; Susan Howe says 
        in an interview with Tom Beckett. &quot;No matter what I thought my original 
        intentions were that's where they go. The past is present when I write&quot; 
        (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 20</i>). To Edward Foster in a subsequent 
        interview, she thus acknowledges, in terms more affirmative, &quot;So 
        history and fiction have always been united in my mind. It would be hard 
        to think of poetry apart from history&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        17</i>); &quot;I don't think you can divorce poetry from history and culture&quot; 
        (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 22</i>). So composes the poet, writing in poetry 
        a history &quot;[outside authority, eccentric and unique&quot; (<i>My 
        Emily</i>, <i>28</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howe's 
        concern with history, described by Joel Lewis as &quot;continual, obsessive&quot; 
        (<i>Lewis, 60</i>), presents a familiar and yet peculiar characteristic 
        in contemporary poetics. It is familiar in that the literary engagement 
        with history is probably the most persistent, if not the most prominent, 
        trait of fin de siecle modernism, a legacy of its overarching presence 
        in the modernist tradition. Advocated by Ezra Pound and carried out by 
        such modernist and postmodernist precursors as T. S. Eliot, William Carlos 
        Williams, and Charles Olson, the praxis of writing poetry &quot;including 
        history&quot; finds its diverse forms in, for example, <i>The Cantos</i>, 
        <i>The Wasteland</i>, <i>In the American Grain</i>, and <i>Call Me Ishmael.</i> 
        Moreover, contemporary poets like Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Ron 
        Silliman, Lyn Hejinian, and so forth, the so-called language group, also 
        make frequent use of historical material in their poems.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> All 
        this is well known. Despite the familiarity, however, Howe's use of history 
        departs radically from that of other poets, past and present, in several 
        ways. What distinguishes Howe especially in this respect is the poet's 
        unremitting insistence upon the fusion of &quot;history and fiction.&quot; 
        In contrast to the modernist &quot;poetry including history,&quot; which 
        still demarcates truth from untruth, Howe's fusion of &quot;history and 
        fiction&quot; not only erases that boundary but also, by extension, calls 
        our attention to the artificiality of such a distinction. Thus engendered, 
        then, is a critical perspective which insists that &quot;what we were 
        given of tradition is what we must break off, examine, fabricate&quot; 
        (<i>DuPlessis, 130</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Closely 
        related to Howe's fusion of poetry and history is her position in relation 
        to history and its hegemonic discourse. Gender oriented, Howe's position 
        can be described in DuPlessis's terms as that of &quot;both/and&quot; 
        or &quot;insider-outsider&quot; (<i>DuPlessis, 6, 8</i>). While the poet 
        is inside history &quot;by her social position, by her class,&quot; she 
        is by gender &quot;outside the dominant systems of meaning, value, and 
        power&quot; (<i>DuPlessis 8, 14</i>). In this sense, Howe analyzes history 
        critically with &quot;[d]oubled consciousness. Doubled understandings,&quot; 
        disclosing its &quot;shifts, contraries, negations, contradictions,&quot; 
        and &quot;reground[ing] representation in, at least, a critical reading 
        of its formerly assumed and unquestioned mechanisms&quot; (<i>DuPlessis 
        6, 8, 122</i>). When reading history, she examines &quot;what is inside 
        the book, what is outside&quot;; when writing poetry, &quot;[s]he is inside 
        the book writing almost outside the book,&quot; taking &quot;the responsibility 
        of writing the book outside the book&quot; (<i>DuPlessis 130, 136</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indeed, 
        it is this double position that enables Howe to critically engage history. 
        As Teresa de Lauretis argues, &quot;[Paradoxically, the only way to position 
        oneself outside of that discourse is to displace oneself within it &#150; 
        to refuse the question as formulated, or to answer deviously (though in 
        its words), event to quote (but against the grain)&quot; (<i>de Lauretis, 
        7</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Howe's 
        use of history also differs in why it is evoked in the first place. Although 
        poets frequently resort to historical material, seldom is history per 
        se their focal point. Rather, it is invoked for diverse purposes: Pound's 
        attempt to maintain a global and cultural coherence; Eliot's effort to 
        make the world and art possible when, as Yeats puts it, &quot;[t]hings 
        fall apart; the center cannot hold&quot; (<i>&quot;The Second Coming&quot; 
        3</i>); Williams's plan to rescue and rename &quot;the strange phosphorus 
        of the life, nameless under an old misappellation&quot; (<i>Williams, 
        v</i>); or 0lson's intention of reconstructing what Joel Lewis calls the 
        &quot;Gowandaland's Atlantic rip&quot; (<i>Lewis, 60</i>). More recently, 
        history is invoked in the name of Andrews' desire to explore the &quot;social, 
        political dimension in writing&quot; (<i>Andrews, 24</i>); Bernstein's 
        interest in being &quot;drenched in the downpour of words&quot; (<i>Bernstein, 
        11</i>); Silliman's concern, particularly in Tjanting, with how social 
        dynamics can actually &quot;act upon and enter into the subjective in 
        order to create the Subject&quot; (<i>Silliman, 35</i>); and Hejinian's 
        emphasis on writing, which, she believes, &quot;emerges from within a 
        pre-existent text of one's own devising or another's&quot; (<i>Hejinian, 
        30</i>). Whatever the purpose, history as a political and ideological 
        construct is not directly challenged on its own terms.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howe's 
        poems, on the contrary, subpoena history for an investigation of its violent 
        crime against women. &quot;Sometimes I think my poetry is only a search 
        by an investigator for the point where the crime began,&quot; says the 
        poet (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 21</i>). That being so, poetry becomes 
        for Howe counterdiscourse to history, a &quot;rereading [of] the reading 
        that a social status quo puts [her] through&quot; (<i>Andrews, 27</i>). 
        When enacted in poetry &quot;with the foregrounding of language&quot; 
        (<i>Hartley, xii</i>), Howe's rereading demonstrates itself through a 
        complex and peculiar textual feminism that, &quot;growing out of but rethinking 
        the work of Stein,&quot; is characterized by its &quot;rematerializing 
        written expression&quot; (<i>Lazer, 10</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1</b></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        Howe's work, history, particularly in the sense of historiography, has 
        two diametrically disparate versions. On the one hand, history is viewed 
        as &quot;the record of winners. Documents . . . written by the Masters&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, &quot;Statement,&quot; 15</i>). As a predominantly male-gendered, 
        rationalized fabrication, it exists, therefore, only inside what Howe 
        describes as &quot;some intellectual fusion or agreement&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        17</i>). As such, Howe contends, it is a discriminatory as well as coercive 
        construct vested with a historical consciousness which &quot;is still 
        male&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 26</i>) and in which women &quot;have 
        no choice&quot; (<i>&quot;Statement,&quot; 16</i>). Dictated by such a 
        unilateral consensus, history is found &quot;always stamped PASSED BY 
        EXAMINER&quot; (<i>&quot;Statement,&quot; 16</i>) and, when occasion requires, 
        &quot;can be falsified, has been falsified&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        17</i>). On the other hand, history is keenly felt by the poet as &quot;an 
        actuality,&quot; one that exists &quot;outside&quot; that patriarchal 
        process of intellectual fusion or agreement (<i>Foster, in Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 
        17</i>) and with which women identify themselves. Though concrete, original, 
        and uncompromising, as &quot;actuality&quot; suggests, this &quot;outside&quot; 
        version of history, according to Howe, is nonetheless deprived of its 
        right to articulate in a language that, itself, is &quot;the absolute 
        male&quot; (<i>McCaffery, &quot;Scene,&quot; 88</i>). As a result, history 
        as an actuality is rendered expressionless except in the forms of &quot;the 
        gaps and silences&quot; in which women, otherwise already represented 
        and spoken for, find themselves (<i>Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 17</i>). 
        It is with these two versions of history that Howe's poetry attempts to 
        &quot;collide&quot; and &quot;collude,&quot; respectively.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howe's 
        poems, taken collectively or individually, embody what Marjorie Perloff 
        describes as &quot;the impingement of historical or biographical narrative 
        on lyric consciousness&quot; (<i>Perloff, 29</i>), so much so that history 
        and poetry become virtually inseparable. Howe's fusion of history and 
        poetry, carried with increasing emphasis to the point of interdependency 
        or mutual identification, functions to reposition the power relations 
        between the two by providing poetry with an entry point into history, 
        into what hitherto has always been the sealed authoritarian discourse 
        of history. In this readjusted relationship, history is transformed into 
        a flawed text yet to be examined by a sensibility that, &quot;read[ing] 
        a past that is a huge imagination of one form,&quot; pulls a different 
        text from it, a text of &quot;SHE from all the myriad symbols and sightings 
        of HE&quot; (<i>Howe, My Emily 106, 17-18</i>). While history as traditionally 
        understood and defined ceases to be definitive, poetry, or the writing 
        of poetry as a present, continuous praxis, acquires a new political and 
        historical status. Not only does poetry refuse, for the first time, to 
        take history for granted, already &quot;a direct challenge to social norms&quot; 
        (<i>Andrews, 31</i>), it also tries to rectify the historically wrong. 
        For poetry &quot;brings similitude and representation to configurations 
        waiting from forever to be spoken&quot;; as a poet, Howe writes, &quot;I 
        write to break out into perfect primeval Consent. I wish I could tenderly 
        lift from the dark side of history, voices that are anonymous, slighted 
        &#150; inarticulate&quot; (<i>&quot;Statement,&quot; 17</i>). A corrective 
        response to the limits of history, poetry becomes the rewriting of &quot;its 
        material . . . the raw materials of a society, a collection of practices 
        &amp; avowals &amp; disavowals, governed by discourse&quot; (<i>Andrews, 
        29</i>). For Howe, the rewriting of history lies in the writing of a poetry 
        that in and of itself represents &quot;a recognition that there is another 
        voice, an attempt to hear and speak it&quot; (<i>192</i>) and &quot;acknowledges, 
        or faces up to, its material base as a rewriting of the language&quot; 
        (<i>Andrews, 25</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Written 
        &quot;in and against&quot; (<i>Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 17</i>) history 
        as an actuality, Howe's poetry can be characterized as what Janet Rodney 
        calls &quot;Language Engendering&quot; (<i>Rodney, 50</i>), one that is 
        based upon its deconstructive posture toward the existing sociolinguistic 
        formation. For poetry to &quot;shelter other voices&quot; (<i>Howe, &quot;Difficulties,&quot; 
        25</i>), the poet has to reorient herself to language: &quot;I think the 
        poet opens herself. . . . You open yourself and let language enter, let 
        it lead you somewhere ... let various things &#150; memories, fragments, 
        bits, pieces, scraps, sounds &#150; let them all work into something. 
        This has to do with changing order and abolishing categories. It has to 
        do with sounds in silence&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 23</i>). Out 
        of this de/re-construction process emerges &quot;a new kind of narrative 
        [that] will lead to a new kind of history&quot; (<i>Barone, 108</i>) in 
        which the poet is enabled to meet the past. As an effort &quot;to understand 
        the writers or people,&quot; this meeting with the past is intended, however, 
        &quot;not to explain the work, not to translate it, but to meet the work 
        with writing... to meet in time, not just from place to place but from 
        writer to writer, mind to mind, friend to friend, from words to words&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 17</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howe's 
        meeting with the past, then, occurs simultaneously in several dimensions: 
        temporal (&quot;in time&quot;), geographical (&quot;from place to place&quot;), 
        perceptional (&quot;from writer to writer, mind to mind&quot;), relational 
        (&quot;friend to friend&quot;), and linguistic (&quot;from words to words&quot;). 
        If the geographical and relational aspects manifest themselves mainly 
        in Howe's preoccupation with certain physical locations (New England, 
        for instance) and her sympathetic treatment of some historical figures 
        (Reverend Hope Atherton, Mary Rowlandson, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, 
        to name a few), the others find expression in a poetry textually designed 
        as &quot;[m]essages [that] must be seen to be heard to say&quot; (<i>Howe, 
        &quot;Interview,&quot; 16</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howe's 
        perceptional meeting with the past &quot;from writer to writer, mind to 
        mind&quot; is what constitutes her poetry as &quot;messages.&quot; The 
        mutual embracing of two minds, which leads to &quot;the immediate feeling 
        of understanding&quot; (<i>Howe, My Emily, 51</i>), finds in poetry &quot;a 
        different way of knowing things&quot; (<i>Foster, in Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 
        23</i>). Also different is that this &quot;new way of perceiving&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, My Emily, 51</i>) &quot;depends on chance, on randomness&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 23</i>). Moreover, since poetry as messages 
        can be deciphered only by way of &quot;the immediate feeling of understanding,&quot; 
        the meeting with the past is, by nature, a reliving experience, the physical 
        aspect of which is materialized in the meeting &quot;from words to words.&quot; 
        Poetry, for Howe, has to be presented visually &quot;as a physical act&quot; 
        and &quot;must really be experienced as handwritten productions . . . 
        the print on the page . . . the shapes of words&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        16</i>). Equally related to this &quot;seen&quot; quality of Howe's poetry 
        is the temporal aspect of the historical meeting. More than &quot;just 
        chronology&quot; (<i>Foster, in Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 30</i>), 
        time is conceptualized by the poet in this context as &quot;space-time,&quot; 
        the intrinsic property of which Howe specifies as &quot;the thing that 
        isn't chaos&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 30</i>). And this space-time 
        dimension is evidenced in poetry in &quot;the surface &#150; the space 
        of the paper itself&quot; (<i>Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 16</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
        presented visually and physically, poetry as messages, however, still 
        has to be sounded to be heard. Howe's sustained interest in sound is closely 
        tied to her search for the origins of history as an actuality. &quot;In 
        my poetry,&quot; the poet claims, &quot;time and again, questions of assigning 
        the cause of history dictate the sound of what is thought&quot; (<i>&quot;Statement,&quot; 
        16</i>). For Howe regards sound as the &quot;key to the untranslatable 
        hidden cause,&quot; as both &quot;a refuge and a bridge&quot; (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 
        21, 17</i>), whereby a retreat from conventional significations paradoxically 
        uncovers an unacknowledged message from &quot;an under voice that was 
        speaking from the beginning&quot; (<i>&quot;Encloser,&quot; 192</i>). 
        There is, in this view, &quot;a direct relation between sound and meaning&quot; 
        to the extent that &quot;little by little sound [grows] to be meaning&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, &quot;Encloser&quot; 182, 179</i>). Indeed, in her effort to 
        unravel the message from history, Howe in her poetry &quot;tries to sound 
        every part&quot; (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 21</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howe 
        finds support for her belief in sound as &quot;always part of perfect 
        meaning&quot; (<i>My Emily, 55</i>) in algebra and in catastrophe theory. 
        (<a href="howe_ma.html#FT1">1</a><a name="Ref1"></a>) Algebraic formulas,&quot; Howe 
        suggests, &quot;are also articulations of sound forms in time&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        30</i>) realized through singularities. A singularity, defined by the 
        poet as &quot;a chaotic point,&quot; constitutes the juncture &quot;where 
        plus becomes minus. . . . where there is a sudden change to something 
        completely else. . . . It's the point chaos enters cosmos, the instant 
        articulation. Then there is a leap into something else&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        30-31</i>). But the focus of Howe's enthusiasm is not chaos and catastrophe 
        per se but that which is to emerge from them.(<a href="howe_ma.html#FT2">2</a><a name="Ref2"></a>) 
        In other words, the poet perceives, beyond the singularities, a new, different 
        order envisioned either implicitly as &quot;the thing that isn't chaos,&quot; 
        &quot;something completely else,&quot; &quot;the potential,&quot; or explicitly 
        as in &quot;[c]atastrophe theory says that there is order in catastrophe&quot; 
        (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 30-31</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 
        addition, Howe sustains her belief in order by a corresponding belief 
        in the engendering capability and capacity of words, of language. She 
        takes a bifurcated view of the poet in relation to language, which is 
        suggested in a pronouncement in her &quot;Defenestration of Prague&quot;: 
        &quot;For we are language Lost / in language&quot; (<i>&quot;Defenestration 
        of Prague,&quot; 99</i>). Here the speaker aligns herself with one language 
        against the other in which it is lost: the systematic network of linguistic 
        signs &quot;already ordered into social codes, into meaning making &amp; 
        mediating&quot; (<i>Andrews, 25</i>), precluding the legitimacy of &quot;an 
        undervoice.&quot; Socially imprisoning and yet &quot;life-giving,&quot; 
        this language, then, circumscribes what Howe describes as &quot;a wild 
        interiority&quot; whose &quot;linguistic nature is always foreign&quot; 
        to the poet (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 26</i>). With this language 
        of interiority as a forbidden zone, the poet finds herself &quot;a foreigner 
        in her own language. I don't want to stay inside&quot; (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 
        27</i>). But at the same time, &quot;[w]e are language,&quot; a language 
        that carries each individual's &quot;context, or imprint&quot; (<i>Andrews, 
        26</i>), that forms the &quot;dark life&quot; in that &quot;wild inferiority&quot; 
        and in which the poet seeks refuge (<i>Howe, &quot;Difficulties,&quot; 
        26</i>). Yet this &quot;dark life&quot; beyond the singularity is for 
        Howe anything but dark: &quot;Words are candles lighting the dark. ... 
        I think that there has to be some order if only order in dis-order. And 
        words and sounds are ... they reach up out there. A little nicker in silence 
        ... a signal&quot; (<i>Interview,&quot; 22</i>). Both in time and in space, 
        words form a configuration in which the poet, as Howe sees in Dickinson, 
        discovers &quot;sense in the chance meeting of words&quot; (<i>My Emily 
        24</i>). Truly indeed, &quot;[t]he fight for language,&quot; as Steve 
        McCaffery remarks in &quot;From the Notebooks,&quot; &quot;is also a fight 
        inside language&quot; (<i>McCaffery, &quot;From the Notebooks,&quot;</i> 
        <i>159</i>). In this sense, Howe's own exploration in poetry of &quot;the 
        implications of breaking the law just short of breaking off communication&quot; 
        (<i>My Emily, 11</i>) finds its encouragement in the belief that a word 
        &quot;persists even in the state of its own excommunication&quot; from 
        traditional semantics (<i>McCaffery, &quot;Sound&quot; 90</i>). As &quot;[l]ife 
        opens into conceptless perspectives,&quot; Howe writes, &quot;[l]anguage 
        surrounds Chaos&quot; (<i>&quot;Statement&quot; 16</i>). </font></p>

        The title page of &quot;Scattering As Behavior Toward Risk&quot; consists, 
        strictly speaking, of three texts: a passage from &quot;Deuteronomye,&quot; 
        the title &quot;Scattering As Behavior Toward Risk,&quot; and a graphic 
        of a coffin (<i>Howe, &quot;Scattering,&quot; 61</i>). Although the layout 
        of the title page indicates no necessary hierarchy among these texts, 
        some evidence &#150; the change in typeface from Trump Mediaeval to boldface 
        and finally to a conspicuous graphic vis-a-vis the change in texts from 
        a historical record to a lyric utterance and finally to a symbol &#150; 
        does suggest a shift of emphasis from historical representation to poetic 
        presentation. When read in that order, each text functions as a critical 
        explication of the preceding one. Centrifugal in propensity, all, however, 
        point at a singularity, a catastrophe of both conflict and bifurcation. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Taken 
        from &quot;Song of Moses,&quot; &quot; 'Deuteronomye,' XXXII. 26&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, &quot;Scattering,&quot; 61</i>) recalls, according to standard 
        Bible commentary. God's decision to refrain from destroying the nation 
        of Israel so as to assert his absolute lordship over the whole earth. 
        Yet paradoxically, this supreme monotheism, intended by God so as not 
        &quot;to scater the therowout the worlde&quot; (<i>qtd. in Howe, &quot;Scattering,&quot; 
        61</i>), was subverted: the Jews were to scatter when Moses's death prevented 
        him from guiding them to the promised land. Howe's citation of this passage 
        forcefully foregrounds this historical context, which is usually pushed 
        into the background by God's presence. In the context of the title page, 
        it is not so much the authorial intention (&quot;I haue determened to&quot;) 
        as the action verb (&quot;scater&quot;) that holds the spotlight, and 
        faith, when so viewed, seems more a property of the latter than the former. 
        In this manner, Howe's citation brings back a historical moment temporally 
        balanced between holding on to and letting go of authority and control, 
        beyond which awaits no necessary destination. But there remains another 
        question. If Howe's action verb &quot;scater&quot; suggests Howe's challenge 
        to authorial centering, what, specifically, is the targeted monotheism? 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
        is implied in the citation from Deuteronomy is explicated in &quot;Scattering 
        As Behavior Toward Risk.&quot; As a response to the biblical text, this 
        title is distinctly secular, unconcerned with God's determination or Moses's 
        anxiety about his people's future. Devoid of any trace of devotional vibrance, 
        it focuses immediately and exclusively on scattering. The poet explicates 
        &quot;Scattering&quot; as &quot;Behavior,&quot; a term of scientific note 
        in chaos theory, which also suggests, by way of a play with its moral 
        connotations, individuality as a critique of authority. For behavior denotes 
        &quot;the way a person behaves or acts ... in conformity with the required 
        standards of decorum&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>). Since scattering is certainly 
        not prescribed by God, it is performed in accordance with a different, 
        individual standard, the value and the validity of which are acknowledged 
        through the conspicuous absence of adjectival modifiers for &quot;Behavior,&quot; 
        modifiers like dangerous, unfaithful, or blasphemous that could otherwise 
        be present. Moreover, &quot;Scattering&quot; is a &quot;Behavior,&quot; 
        so continues the poet, &quot;Toward Risk.&quot; Defined as &quot;the chance 
        of injury, damage, or loss&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>), risk in fact encompasses 
        in its semantic range the juxtaposition of two existing possibilities. 
        Although its denotation focuses on the negative, its connotation does 
        not exclude the positive. What the word really highlights, then, is chance, 
        which, in the context of the title as a critical response to &quot; 'Deuteronomye,' 
        XXXII. 26,&quot; seems to favor gain over loss. Also implied in risk is 
        voluntariness (<i>danger, Webster's</i>) by the individual taking an action; 
        hence the poet's further privileging of personal autonomy over a collective, 
        subjugated mind-set.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
        &quot;Scattering As Behavior Toward Risk&quot; suggests that individuality 
        and chance may lead to something ideal, the graphic of a coffin delineates 
        what the poet sees as &quot;breaks in world-historical reason&quot; (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 
        20</i>). Emblematic of death, the coffin refers back to the passage from 
        &quot;Song of Moses&quot; in two ways. On the one hand, as an icon, it 
        embodies the intended preservation of the spirit, the painstaking effort 
        at containment, and the conscious assertion of a remote control. On the 
        other, it works as an index to the paradox that to make a coffin is to 
        begin its simultaneous decomposition. Particularly in this context, the 
        coffin brings to the immediate fore not only the extinction of Moses's 
        physical life but with it, and more importantly, the death of his songs, 
        his speeches, his words. Still supposedly functioning as the center, the 
        coffin in this sense becomes what Howe describes, in A Bibliography of 
        the King's Book: Or, Eikon Basilike, as &quot;[t]he absent center [that] 
        is the ghost of a king,&quot; the king being, in Foster's words, &quot;authority 
        and so the origin of meaning&quot; (<i>in Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 
        34</i>). With the death of the king, &quot;what is left in words themselves&quot; 
        (<i>Foster, in Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 34</i>) is &quot;the singularity 
        ... a catastrophe of bifurcation ... a sudden leap into another situation. 
        The ghost (the entrance point of a singularity) is the only thing we have&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, &quot;Interview,&quot; 34</i>). Howe's targeted monotheism, viewed 
        in this light, seems to be patriarchal language. Indeed, in contrast to 
        the well-formulated syntactical and grammatical structure of the quote 
        from &quot;Song of Moses&quot; at the top of the title page, the coffin 
        leaves behind it, in textual illustration, only a wide open space, a perfect 
        silence, or, in the poet's own words, &quot;another situation,&quot; in 
        which the poet is &quot;THE REVISER&quot; (<i>&quot;Scattering,&quot; 
        70</i>), and her working material is language in its received model. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        first line of the poem, with its quotation marks and its asterisk footnoting 
        &quot;Billy Budd: The Genetic Text&quot; at the bottom of the page (<i>63</i>), 
        identifies itself as a borrowed text to which the rest of the poem constitutes 
        a response (<i>see Quartermain</i>). The line's larger context is the 
        description of the exact moment of Billy Budd's execution. Decoded, this 
        line may read as follows, according to Peter Quartermain: &quot;on a [cross 
        out in pencil all the words from 'suddenly' to 'on a'; insert, above the 
        line and with a caret, the words 'was shot thro with a dyed'; cross out 
        with (the same?) pencil the word 'dyed' and insert, above the line, with 
        a caret, the words 'a soft']&quot; (<i>Quartermain, 76</i>). Howe's visual 
        reproduction of this line undergoing complicated editing makes two statements. 
        First, a &quot;text itself,&quot; as Rodney argues, &quot;is history, 
        is people&quot; (<i>Rodney, 47</i>), whatever its kind, and the production 
        of a reading text out of a genetic one mirrors the fabrication of chronicles 
        out of actuality. For in both, &quot;[m]alice,&quot; in the form of editorial 
        violence, &quot;dominates the history of Power and Progress&quot; (<i>Howe, 
        &quot;Statement&quot; 15</i>). Second, what is usually edited out, the 
        poet further indicates, is the feminine.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
        this in mind, Howe's citation of Melville's Billy Budd in the first line 
        becomes meaningful. Howe keenly feels a mysterious bond with the nineteenth-century 
        writer, because manifest in Melville's work is a quality of &quot;the 
        feminine&quot; (<i>Howe, &quot;Difficulties,&quot; 18; &quot;Interview,&quot; 
        37</i>) that she finds irresistible. &quot;If his were just a masculine 
        World View I wouldn't be so fascinated by it and feel so close to it&quot; 
        (<i>&quot;Difficulties,&quot; 18</i>), the poet believes; &quot;There 
        has to be a reason why his writing speaks so directly to me&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        37</i>). One particular expression of Melville's feminine quality is stutter 
        or stammer. &quot;A 'sheltered' woman,&quot; Howe remarks in <i>My Emily 
        Dickinson</i>, &quot;audaciously invented a new grammar grounded in humility 
        and hesitation. HESITATE from the Latin, meaning to stick. Stammer. To 
        hold back in doubt, having difficulty speaking&quot; (<i>My Emily, 21</i>). 
        Stuttering, for Howe, becomes the &quot;sounding of uncertainty. What 
        is silenced or not quite silenced. All the broken dreams&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        37</i>).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        connection could not be clearer. Not only does Melville associate Billy 
        Budd with feminine beauty but he also portrays him as &quot;illiterate,&quot; 
        a person without a language, who cannot speak for himself or say &quot;No&quot; 
        to others, but who &quot;could sing, and . . . was sometimes the composer 
        of his own song&quot; (<i>Melville, 239</i>). When &quot;under sudden 
        provocation of strong heart-feeling,&quot; his already limited oral articulation 
        would be further impeded by &quot;an organic hesitancy, &#150; in fact 
        more or less of a stutter or even worse&quot; (<i>Melville, 241</i>). 
        The result is a double victimization of this &quot;Handsome Sailor&quot; 
        (<i>Melville, 241</i>). First, Billy Budd is framed by John Claggart, 
        &quot;the master-at-arms&quot; (<i>Melville, 252</i>), whose ability to 
        manipulate words makes his official title in fact synonymous with &quot;the 
        master-at-language,&quot; and then executed by Captain Vere, whose patriarchal 
        eloquence helps justify his killing of Billy Budd by killing first his 
        own &quot;immediate feeling of understanding.&quot; The whole incident, 
        so manufactured by language, is then permanently established &quot;in 
        one naval chronicle of the time, an authorized weekly publication&quot; 
        and &quot;has stood in human record&quot; ever since (<i>Melville, 325, 
        327</i>). There is no better example to illustrate Howe's argument. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Viewed 
        in such contexts, the first line of the poem becomes a literal demonstration. 
        How to read it in the traditional sense becomes then entirely irrelevant; 
        for the line is designed to show, through its form, how a patriarchal, 
        linguistic order is being &quot;wrestled from&quot; the dark life (<i>Quartermain, 
        78</i>) and how history as the record of winners violates and murders 
        history as an actuality through editors' pencils, erasers, scissors, and 
        knives. Both literally and metaphorically, grammatical signs such as [ 
        ], &lt; &gt;,..., and are seen busy at work, effecting sentencing and 
        imposing imprisonment in the selective procedure of semantic construction. 
        Conversely, however, a detailed presentation of a line violently dismembered 
        by editing erects obstacles to routine information processing, which forces 
        the traditionally trained sensibility to sound out for clarification. 
        What is reexperienced, through an individual meeting with the words, is 
        the &quot;uncertainty. What is silenced or not quite silenced. All the 
        broken dreams.&quot; Through her borrowed text, then, Howe outlines a 
        revised history, in which the so-called chronicle of civilization is exposed 
        as a murderous campaign against the Other and in which what has been formerly 
        kept invisible and silent is given form and voice. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        first line's demonstrativeness finds its explication in the second. The 
        thematic consonance between the two is shown in the repeated use of parentheses 
        and brackets, suggesting the restrictions and relegations against which 
        the feminine has to struggle in order to emerge. The seemingly ambiguous 
        subject for &quot;(became the vision)&quot; (<i>63</i>) is now rendered 
        graspable: it is the first line &#150; what it shows rather than what 
        it says. Moreover, in its incompleteness, &quot;(the rea)&quot; (<i>63</i>) 
        offers itself as a clue. For in Latin, as Quartermain demonstrates, rea 
        is &quot;a juridical word,&quot; meaning, among other things, a defendant 
        or a prisoner of feminine gender (<i>Quartermain, 74, 75</i>). And the 
        parenthesis, while semantically confining &quot;the rea,&quot; also designates 
        the word as the logical appositive to &quot;the vision,&quot; thus specifying 
        &quot;the vision&quot; as a prisoner's/ feminine vision. Equally plausible 
        is that &quot;(the rea)&quot; functions, simultaneously, as the adjectival 
        modifier for what follows it. As the physical embodiment of the nature 
        of &quot;(the rea),&quot; the disjunct form of &quot;after Though [though]That&quot; 
        (<i>63</i>) shows something quite visible but not quite bridged, which 
        is, discernibly, &quot;Thought.&quot; The letter t, essential to the coming 
        into being of a complete and independent intellectual entity, is either 
        imprisoned (&quot;Though [t . . .]&quot;) or taken away (&quot;[though]T 
        . . .&quot;). Further, the incomplete &quot;Though,&quot; with its first 
        letter symbolically elevated into upper case out of the bracket but relegated 
        into lower case in it, can only be an &quot;after Though&quot; (<i>63</i>), 
        meaning, as the word after denotes, a &quot;Though&quot; &quot;in spite 
        of&quot; or &quot;in defiance of; regardless of; notwithstanding&quot; 
        (<i>Webster's</i>) &quot;the old army / Enlightened rationalism&quot; 
        (<i>Howe, &quot;Scattering,&quot; 64</i>). Yet as much as the second line 
        shows the imprisonment of the feminine vision, it does offer, again through 
        its form, a way out. The solution lies in &quot;[though]That / Fa&quot; 
        (<i>63</i>). Physically as well as grammatically, the word &quot;That,&quot; 
        as a relative pronoun, stands for both &quot;[though]&quot; that precedes 
        it and the subject of a restrictive clause that follows it, thus reaching 
        backward to complete &quot;[though]&quot; by ignoring the bracket (&quot;[though]T&quot;) 
        and forward to suggest how to do so (&quot;Fa&quot;). As &quot;a musical 
        term (the fourth note of the octave)&quot; (<i>Quartermain, 73</i>), &quot;Fa&quot; 
        clearly refers to a sound form. Hence this paraphrasing of &quot;[though]That 
        / Fa&quot;: &quot;though&quot; that sounds will become &quot;ThoughT.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
        &quot;immediate feeling of understanding,&quot; acquired by way of an 
        encounter with the past through form and sound, fosters an inquiry into 
        the causes of history as the documents written by &quot;the Masters.&quot; 
        In a tone not without ironic sting, the rhetorical question &quot;But 
        what is envy [but what is envy] / Is envy the bonfire inkling?&quot; (<i>63</i>) 
        pinpoints one cause by repeating the key word envy three times. The winners 
        or masters resort to violence, these two lines suggest, not because they 
        feel superior in possession of all essential qualities, but because they 
        realize they do not and cannot have them. (<a href="howe_ma.html#FT3">3</a><a name="Ref3"></a>) Therefore, as remedy, they 
        suppress what they lack: &quot;Shackles [(shackles) ] as we were told 
        the . . . [precincts]&quot; (<i>63</i>). Shackles and parentheses, precincts 
        and brackets, the former enclosed in the latter: every element in this 
        line, appositionally employed, mirrors forced restrictions and confining 
        boundaries. Equally illustrative is the use of the passive voice, &quot;as 
        we were told,&quot; in which the speaker, by virtue of her syntactical 
        position and grammatical status, is identified with &quot;(the rea)&quot; 
        in the second line. Besides, the two &quot;shackles,&quot; one's first 
        letter in upper case and the other's in lower case, create a visual difference 
        in that the latter seems smaller, an effect further enhanced by its double 
        enclosure. What is effected by this bracket-within-parenthesis configuration 
        is &quot;space-time,&quot; in which the word &quot;shackles&quot; is seen 
        retreating into the background, existing in the past, but recognizing 
        its present-day counterpart &quot;Shackles.&quot; Such a textual design 
        in turn dictates that the sounding of these two words must vary in both 
        tone and volume to produce an echoing effect. In Howe's poetry as revised 
        history, &quot;the language of the present&quot; is indeed &quot;charged 
        with echoes from an earlier time&quot; (<i>Perloff, 31</i>). <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        If the poem's first six lines comprise an introduction to what is suppressed 
        in Billy Budd, the rest of the poem continues to explicate the issue, 
        proceeding from general to specific, from saying to showing. Howe begins 
        this with a broad portrayal of the nature of the official history: </font></p>

        done but for what she is. History as such can be nothing but &quot;a story,&quot; 
        the fictitiousness of which demands, as its supplement, &quot;measured 
        forms&quot; (<i>Melville, 323</i>) and high theatricality concretized 
        in &quot;Trial and suffering / of Mercy.&quot; (<a href="howe_ma.html#FT4">4</a><a name="Ref4"></a>)

      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two 
        things stand out in this stanza. First, the sense of the Other, of wilderness, 
        and of an unprecedented wandering in an uncharted territory is brought 
        out by the four lines in the middle, where phrases such as &quot;No track,&quot; 
        &quot;the otherday,&quot; and &quot;wild thoughtpath&quot; suggest that 
        this is &quot;another situation.&quot; Second, what marks this wandering 
        &quot;on wild thoughtpath&quot; as different is the wanderer's unbending 
        determination, expressed not only in her &quot;No coming out&quot; but 
        in her &quot;Face of adamant / Steel of the face / Breast.&quot; Emphatically 
        capitalized and gender-specific, the word &quot;Breast,&quot; in addition, 
        relates itself to &quot;bears&quot; in the second line, which puns upon 
        the verb bear in its third person singular form, meaning, among other 
        things, &quot;to give birth to ... to bring forth; produce or yield&quot; 
        (<i>Webster's</i>). Thus, the wandering in the wilderness is, in its own 
        right, a productive process as opposed to &quot;a Zero-sum game&quot; 
        (<i>68</i>). </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
        two sections then find, in a stanza across the page (<i>65</i>), an almost 
        line-to-line substantiation grounded in the story of Billy Budd. Clearly 
        reminiscent of Captain Vere's eloquent defense of the interests of the 
        King at Billy Budd's trial, the first six lines in this section again 
        expose, more explicitly, the nature of patriarchal history. Such a history, 
        the poet argues, presents a &quot;political literature,&quot; the author 
        of which is no other than the &quot;iconic Collective&quot; or, as the 
        poet mentions later, the &quot;Patron of stealthy action&quot; (<i>67</i>). 
        This history's &quot;Soliloquy and the aside&quot; (<i>65</i>) aim, politically, 
        at &quot;Violent order of a world&quot; (<i>65</i>), but socially and 
        economically, at &quot;The protection of sleep / The protection of sheep&quot; 
        (<i>67</i>). History thus becomes equivalent to the &quot;Fiction of administrative 
        law&quot; whereby &quot;Rules are guards and fences / In the court of 
        black earth / to be infinite&quot; (<i>67</i>). </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
        is immediately challenged in the following seven lines by a manifesto 
        of history as actuality. Unequivocally labeled as &quot;Iconoclastic folio 
        subgenre&quot; (65), this history mirrors, in contrast, a dark life, &quot;a 
        life lived by shifts / evil fortunes of another&quot; (<i>65</i>). For 
        the first time, this &quot;another&quot; is identified as the &quot;me&quot; 
        that &quot;Fathers dare not name&quot; (<i>67</i>) and subsequently entitled 
        &quot;the lean Instaurator&quot; (<i>65</i>) or &quot;THE REVISER&quot; 
        (<i>70</i>). &quot;Halfway through Wanderings&quot; (<i>65</i>) &quot;on 
        wild thoughtpath&quot; (<i>64</i>), this &quot;another&quot; experiences 
        &quot;Birth of contemporary thought&quot; (<i>65</i>), a birth already 
        foreshadowed by the words &quot;Breast&quot; and &quot;bears&quot; in 
        the preceding section. Furthermore, this &quot;contemporary thought&quot; 
        is specified as &quot;Counter&quot; (<i>65</i>) to &quot;the old army 
        / Enlightened rationalism&quot; (<i>64</i>), or &quot;thought thought 
        out&quot; (<i>65</i>), an expression in which the past participle phrase 
        &quot;thought out&quot; &#150; both by its resemblance to the modified 
        word and by its &quot;out&quot; denotative of &quot;completely or to the 
        end&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>) &#150; unmasks &quot;Enlightened rationalism&quot; 
        as self-referential logic, or a fabrication totally exhausted. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet 
        for Howe, the &quot;Birth of contemporary thought&quot; (<i>65</i>) only 
        signals, at this stage, &quot;a singularity ... a chaotic point . . . 
        the point chaos enters cosmos,&quot; and its form of articulation, therefore, 
        still lies in those forms that materialize or show its actual &quot;breaking 
        free&quot; from the traditional discourse. (<a href="howe_ma.html#FT5">5</a><a name="Ref5"></a>) 
        In this sense, poetry, as an attempt to revise history, &quot;has involved 
        a breaking of boundaries of all sorts. It involves a fracturing of discourse, 
        a stammering even. Interruption and hesitation used as a force&quot; (<i>Howe, 
        &quot;Encloser,&quot; 192</i>). When written in this manner, poetry then 
        becomes &quot;language stripped to its untranslatability&quot; (<i>Howe, 
        &quot;Difficulties,&quot; 19</i>). A word of caution &#150; to take the 
        word &quot;untranslatability&quot; at its face value is to miss a crucial 
        point in Howe's poetics, for the word does not denote for the poet a linguistic 
        passivity, much less a resignation. Saturated with ironic overtones, it 
        posits itself in open defiance of the &quot;translatability&quot; of the 
        patriarchal discourse, a defiance constitutive, by implication, of a new 
        kind of &quot;translatability.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/howe/images/howe_ma_figure_1.gif" width="504" height="450"></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        Moreover, precisely because Howe's poetry is &quot;about the impossibility 
        of putting in print what the mind really sees&quot; (<i>&quot;Interview,&quot; 
        32</i>), it automatically includes, both in its objective and in its methodology, 
        a concomitant search for the possibility of finding a way to do so. In 
        other words, what begins as a demonstration of impossibility may proceed 
        in due course to the discovery of possibility. The poet's &quot;chance 
        meeting of words,&quot; in this respect, suggests probably the first move 
        in that direction.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Birth 
        of contemporary thought / Counter thought thought out&quot; (<i>65</i>) 
        is then physically presented on the next page, where linear syntactical 
        formations are interrupted by free-floating words (Fig. 1). The first 
        line here, the only one that seems free from any interruption, problematizes 
        nonetheless its own capability of saying what it is constructed to say 
        in that it lacks a proper subject. The inevitable question What is loaded 
        into . . .? crudely mocks the adjective &quot;perfect&quot; by leaving 
        its answer wide open to a game of word substitution, not excluding, of 
        course, those words floating freely. More interesting, then, is the sense 
        created by chance meetings of words and the site at which such meetings 
        occur. What, for instance, seems to be both torpedoed from below by &quot;VIZEADMIRALL&quot; 
        and bombarded from above by &quot;Bisket,&quot; &quot;Risk,&quot; &quot;Herring,&quot; 
        and &quot;Salmon&quot; turns out, significantly, to be the past participle 
        phrase &quot;The best ordered,&quot; the very attribute of &quot;commonwealth.&quot; 
        What is important, in this case, is not what these words represent, much 
        less what they mean. Rather, the &quot;Iconoclastic&quot; (<i>65</i>) 
        gesture is shown in what they do or how they are used: &quot;The best 
        ordered&quot; is put under erasure. Such an attack is immediately reinforced 
        by a dissection of the modified itself as primarily a linguistic construct. 
        Literally and metaphorically, the &quot;commonwealth&quot; is seen as 
        founded comfortably on &quot;Watchwords,&quot; a manipulation of language; 
        and the phrase &quot;That open,&quot; meeting &quot;Watchwords&quot; above 
        and &quot;markets&quot; below, points upward to demilitarize them (&quot;Watchwords 
        That open&quot;) and downward to reveal their secrecy: It is the unilateralness 
        and arbitrariness of language that, in the true sense of the word, &quot;makes&quot; 
        the official history (&quot;Watchwords That open markets&quot;). </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Functioning 
        alongside the chance meeting of words here is &quot;Potentiality of sound 
        to directly signal.&quot; Its antiestablishment stance is doubly emphasized 
        in the pronouncement, &quot;They do not know what a syllable is,&quot; 
        the linear formation of which is rebelliously tilted in an unsupported 
        space, associating it, by illustration, with a falling, if not already 
        fallen, condition still regressing continuously without a period, or more 
        accurately, a stop.(<a href="howe_ma.html#FT6">6</a><a name="Ref6"></a>) In this light, 
        the lines &quot;the sayd / Utopian communism comes in pieces while the 
        Narrative wanders&quot; begin to yield something different. Not only do 
        they shed light on the nature of &quot;the sayd / Utopian communism&quot; 
        as the product of linguistic manufacturing by &quot;comes in pieces while 
        the Narrative wanders&quot; but they also deconstruct such a constructedness 
        through a meeting between &quot;comes&quot; &#150; the key verb suggestive 
        of the birth of social and political structures out of language &#150; 
        and &quot;aboord.&quot; Absent from standard dictionaries, the latter, 
        with its alien grouping of letters, produces a sound that approximates 
        that of abort as a transitive verb. Thus, when the two words meet, the 
        sound of &quot;aboord&quot;/ abort takes charge and &quot;end[s] (a [linguistic] 
        pregnancy) prematurely&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>). In a like manner, &quot;aboord&quot; 
        also meets &quot;Shrowds.&quot; Positioned above and between two lines, 
        &quot;Shrowds,&quot; sounding like shrouds, reifies a linguistic operation 
        that subordinates one line to the other and provides, as a result, a form 
        of articulation for a relationship historically suppressed and disguised: 
        &quot;Values in a discourse. / Shrowds / Potentiality of sound to directly 
        signal.&quot; Exposure then leads to subversion. Again, when &quot;aboord&quot;/abort 
        meets &quot;Shrowds'VShrouds, the former, its offensive posture shown 
        in its physical position in relation to the latter, &quot;cut[s] short&quot; 
        (<i>Webster's</i>) a language action disclosed by the sound signal. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
        &quot;Potentiality of sound to directly signal,&quot; as its phrasing 
        indicates, must yet be adequately developed to counter &quot;Values in 
        a discourse&quot; on a full scale. What it can do, at this moment, is 
        &quot;To hull in the night,&quot; in the dark life lived by the &quot;Instaurator.&quot; 
        As a noun, says the dictionary, hull means either &quot;1. the outer covering 
        of a seed or fruit ... 2. the calyx of some fruits ... 3. any outer covering&quot; 
        or &quot;1. the frame or body of a ship ... 2. a) the main body of an 
        airship b) the frame or main body of a flying boat.&quot; To hull means 
        &quot;to take the hull or hulls off&quot; or &quot;to pierce the hull 
        of (a ship) with a shell, torpedo, etc.&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>). The 
        intended target of &quot;To hull,&quot; seemingly missing here, is nevertheless 
        found through a chance meeting of &quot;the&quot; and &quot;Meaning.&quot; 
        Hanging and dangling awkwardly, the word &quot;Meaning&quot; is presented 
        graphically in this context as an artifact thrown away or a deceptive 
        covering peeled off. To hull the authoritative &quot;Meaning,&quot; then, 
        is to create &quot;the absent center,&quot; to invite &quot;the ghost 
        of a king,&quot; and to initiate &quot;a catastrophe of bifurcation.&quot; 
        With &quot;Meaning&quot; &quot;wavering,&quot; sound begins to celebrate 
        its own audibility: &quot;harmony sparrow that lamentation,&quot; &quot;brawling.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        Howe's rereading of Billy Budd, the poem becomes, both in form and in 
        content, increasingly expressive of the physicality or materiality of 
        language. In ways &quot;just short of breaking off communication,&quot; 
        the configuration in Figure 2 shows, by combining the residue of a formulaic 
        language and the chance meeting of words, the actual dethronement in progress 
        of the patriarchal language, the very moment of a singularity, of a catastrophe 
        of bifurcation (<i>69</i>). Still retaining the basic syntactical units, 
        the cross-page axis can be roughly treated and analyzed as a sentence 
        that consists of these parts: 1) subject: &quot;Wedged destiny,&quot; 
        suggestive of &quot;catastrophe of bifurcation,&quot; of wanderings &quot;on 
        wild thoughtpath&quot;; 2) verb: &quot;shed [cancel whole],&quot; mutually 
        appositive, with the former meaning &quot;a) to cast off or lose ... b) 
        to get rid of&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>); 3) object: &quot;halter measure 
        mutiny Act Wars,&quot; with &quot;mutiny Act Wars&quot; in apposition 
        to &quot;halter measure&quot; and with halter meaning &quot;that by which 
        something is held&quot; or &quot;execution by hanging&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>). 
        When put together, these parts form a semantic cluster, the rebellious 
        message of which seems self-evident. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/howe/images/howe_ma_figure_2.gif" width="504" height="351"></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        a sentence, this line is nevertheless undercut by the lack of a period. 
        Instead, it ends with a signature in the form of a self-portrayal, &quot;Child 
        / regical,&quot; which, through its physical resemblance, evokes the image 
        of a regicide or a subordinate &quot;who kills, or is responsible for 
        the killing of, a king, esp. of his [her] own country&quot; (<i>Webster's</i>). 
        Situated at the end of the line, &quot;Child regical,&quot; having voiced 
        her defiance of the patriarchal &quot;Fiction of administrative law&quot; 
        (<i>67</i>), commits the capital crime of destroying its material language 
        base, pulling its linear structure literally out of balance and, by so 
        doing, ushering in &quot;the entrance point of a singularity.&quot; Finally 
        freed from the &quot;halter measure,&quot; words begin their chance meeting 
        in &quot;another situation.&quot; The three words &quot;Mute,&quot; &quot;fluke,&quot; 
        and &quot;squall,&quot; when met with one another, seem to deliver a certain 
        message. With fluke denoting, as a noun, &quot;an accidentally good or 
        lucky stroke&quot; or as a verb &quot;to hit or get by a fluke,&quot; 
        and squall &quot;a harsh, shrill cry or loud scream&quot; (<i>&quot;Webster's&quot;</i>), 
        the sense of this three-word configuration can be roughly paraphrased 
        as, &quot;Mute, by chance and with risk, could be heard,&quot; or &quot;Silence 
        is loud.&quot; Other meetings of words, similar though even more chancy, 
        appear equally perceivable, such as &quot;in mum,&quot; &quot;tone,&quot; 
        &quot;open,&quot; and so forth. The poem then ends with what can be viewed 
        as a picture, in which the relationship between history as an actuality 
        and history as a record of the winners is shown in the form of an edifice, 
        a shaky one perhaps. Always suppressed and imprisoned at the bottom, history 
        as an actuality, with its &quot;Freak inside the heart&quot; (<i>70</i>), 
        in fact constitutes the broad foundation on which an official history 
        is masterfully fabricated. The process of manufacturing the latter is 
        also the process of its abusing and misusing the former, though whitewashing 
        itself along the way as &#150; read vertically &#150; the &quot;Human 
        / Record&quot; (<i>70</i>). To be &quot;human,&quot; in this sense, is 
        to be &quot;[authoritative]&quot; (<i>70</i>), to be inhuman in an Enlightened 
        rational sort of way. History as such, the poet argues, &quot;cumbered 
        the ground&quot; (<i>70</i>) and therefore has to be thoroughly revised. 
        To fulfill this purpose, there is no better place to start than the foundation, 
        where the suppressed becomes by right &quot;THE REVISER,&quot; a &quot;title&quot; 
        for a &quot;fact,&quot; for an actuality, however &quot;secret&quot; it 
        has been (<i>70</i>). </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        My Emily Dickinson, Howe begins part 1 with this observation: &quot;Emily 
        Dickinson and Gertrude Stein also conducted a skillful and ironic investigation 
        of patriarchal authority over literary history. Who polices questions 
        of grammar, parts of speech, connection, and connotation? Whose order 
        is shut inside the structure of a sentence? What inner articulation releases 
        the coils and complications of Saying's assertions? In very different 
        ways the countermovement of these two women's work penetrates to the indefinite 
        limits of written communication&quot; (<i>11-12</i>). Also in a very different 
        way, Howe joins her two precursors in &quot;Scattering As Behavior Toward 
        Risk.&quot; Colliding with authorized chronicles but colluding with suppressed 
        actuality, the poem shows through its form &quot;[connections between 
        unconnected things,&quot; exhibiting a historical panorama of &quot;Liberty, 
        Exile, Origin&quot; (<i>Howe, My Emily, 97, 107</i>). The speaker's &quot;outside 
        &quot; position in relation to history as a traditional discourse enables 
        her not only to unveil the nature of &quot;thought thought out&quot; as 
        a stifling patriarchal institution but also to become an explorer &quot;dwelling 
        in Possibility&quot; (<i>My Emily, 76</i>). In this sense, &quot;[p]oetry,&quot; 
        as the rewriting of history, &quot;is affirmation in negation&quot; (<i>My 
        Emily, 138</i>), with its centrifugal trajectory hurtling not into nothingness 
        but into a space-time where a new, more comprehensive order already exists 
        in embryo.</font></p>

        Howe is evidently influenced by Rene Thom, particularly his Mathematical 
        Models of Morphogenesis (1983) and Structural Stability and Morphogenesis 
        (1975). Her interest centers on his concept of singularity. <a href="howe_ma.html#Ref1">&gt;</a></font></p>

        Howe seems to associate herself with what N. Katherine Hayles considers 
        the second branch of chaos theory, which emphasizes order out of chaos, 
        self-organization, and disorder as the stimulation to self-organization. 
        For a more detailed discussion, see Hayles, esp. 12. <a href="howe_ma.html#Ref2">&gt;</a></font></p>

        This also holds true for Billy Budd, in which everyone is, to various 
        degrees, envious of the Handsome Sailor, whose perfection in physical 
        beauty and spiritual simplicity causes admiration at best and hatred at 
        worst. John Claggart exemplifies the latter case, which culminates in 
        his outright lies about Billy Budd. Captain Vere, one may argue, is in 
        fact no better. For his envy is disguised under the cloak of his ardent 
        concern for the welfare of the Commonwealth. <a href="howe_ma.html#Ref3">&gt;</a></font></p>

        is a leap into something else&quot; part, still stands in need of an expression, 
        a difficulty yet to be overcome given the fact that &quot;[t]he fight
