<b>Requirements:</b> Attendance is mandatory.  After two unexcused
absences your grade will be lowered half a grade for each missed
class. The success of this seminar depends on your attendance and your
active participation in it: merely coming to class is not enough.  You
need to come prepared having read the assignments and having written
questions of your own about the reading.  Each one of you will have a
chance to lead the class discussion on one of the assigned readings.

SHEET pasted on my office door. Clemens 415.

Five or six response papers (one-two typed page each) are due on the
assigned reading. I will not accept late ones.  FINAL PAPERS MUST BE
ON TIME.
