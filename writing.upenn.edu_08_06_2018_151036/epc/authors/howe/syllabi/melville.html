injuries etc. 

Moby-Dick as precurser of Finnegan's Wake. There are many ways this can 
be done. 

Report on Mardi as Melville's first attempt at a work on the scale of 
Moby-Dick. 

Research on Jonah in scripture and also in American literary 
consciousness. 

Research on Narcissus, narcissism etc in Moby-Dick. 

A reading of both Sedgwick's books Between Men: English Literature and 
Male Homosexual Desire and Epistemology of the Closet in relation to 
Moby or to Melville. 

Exploration of why Melville so fascinated a generation ('50's and 60's) 
of American Literary critics and the canonization of Melville that 
coincided with the beginning of American Studies Departments and the 
subject as a discipline. F.O. Mattheissen, Perry Miller, Henry Murray, 
Charles Olson, to name a few. 

Melville's use of pulp literature such as captivity narratives, travel 
journals, whaling stories, penny journals etc. in his work.
