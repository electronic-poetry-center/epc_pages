English 583. 
Instructor. Susan Howe
Room 309
T. 3:30-5:50

We will begin by examining the literature of Puritan New England. In 17th century American literature (particularly in the Massachusetts
 Bay Colony) there can be found a number of transgressive or marginal figures (converts, heretics, captives, slaves, itinerant preachers,
 native Americans, and witches). Here we can trace an anxiety between the spoken and the written, innocence and experience, 
authenticity and artifice. We will explore a variety of genres with a particular concentration on 17th and 18th century conversion 
narratives. We will then concentrate on the powerful subliminal influence (sometimes not so subliminal) these earlier issues and texts 
exert on certain 19th and 20th century North American writers. We will choose from among the following; Thomas Shepard, Mary 
Rowlandson, Hannah Dustan (via Mather and Thoreau), Mercy Short (Cotton Mather), Jonathan Edwards, Phyllis Wheatley, Charles 
Brockden Brown, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Charles 
Sanders Peirce, Hart Crane, Marianne Moore, and Wallace Stevens.  We will enter our discussions via: Nancy Ruttenburg's 
<i>Democratic Personality: Popular Voice and the Trial of American Authorship</i>. Ruttenburg will visit the seminar. Susan Stewart 
and Lyn Hejinian will give readings and lectures. Both are contemporary poets and scholars whose writing continues to explore the 
relations between lyric and history. 
	What remains when written thought enters into a political economy of values? What does it mean be a visionary poet--is there such
 a thing? How does editing translate or control a visionary work? Does it?

Each session will consist of a relatively short talk on the assigned reading for that week, an oral report and, most importantly, group 
discussion of the reading. There will be two visiting lecturers and I will also ocassionally use slides.
