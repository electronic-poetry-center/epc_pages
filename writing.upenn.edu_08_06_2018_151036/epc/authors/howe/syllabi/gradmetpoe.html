<b>Metaphysical</b>: a.  See metaphysics.  Pertaining or relating to
metaphysics.  2. According to rules or principles of metaphysics; as,
metaphysical reasoning. 3. Preturnatural or supernatural. [not
used]-<b>Metaphysics</b>: n. [It is said that this name was given to
the science by Aristotle, or by his followers, who considered the
science of natural bodies, physics, as the first in the order of
studies, and the science of mind, or intelligence, to be the second. ]
   The science of the principles and causes of all things existing;
hence, the science of mind or intelligence.  This science comprehends
ontology, or the science which treats of the nature, essence, and
qualities, or attributes of being; cosmology, the science of the
world, which treats of the nature and laws of matter and of motion;
antroposophy, which treats of the powers of man, and the motions by
which life is produced; psychology, which treats of the intellectual
soul; pneumatology, or the science of spirits or angels, &c.
Metaphysical theology, called by Leibnitz and others theodicy, treats
of the existence of God, his essence and attributes.  These divisions
of the science of metaphysics, which prevailed in the ancient schools,
are now not much regarded.  The natural division of things that exist
is into body and mind, things material and immaterial.  The former
belongs to physics, and the latter to the science of metaphysics.

<font size=3> <b>Purpose:</b> During the seminar I hope we will
explore together what an American Metaphysical Poetry might be.  Is
there such a thing?  How does American Metaphysical poetry differ from
English Metaphysical poetry?  We will closely read some of the poems
of Dickinson, Whitman, Melville, H.D., Eliot, and Stevens listed in
the syllabus.  Students will be expected to hand in a weekly typed
reaction to the weekly reading and discussion.  You should also be
prepared to talk with Janice Knight and Susan Stanford Friedman on
their work.  Their books will be on reserve at Lockwood.

<b>Requirements: An oral presentation (15-20 minutes )</b> on some
aspect of a particular poem we are reading.  Much of a poem's meaning
is in its sound.  As part of your oral presentation you will be
expected to read aloud whatever poem, or section of a poem, you
choose.  We must decide on the schedule for these report/performances
on our second meeting.  I will assign topics arbitrarily if you havent
got one by September 13.  The first presentation shouldl be presented
on that day and each week following.  <b>A final paper (15-20
double-space pages)</b> due on December 13.

<b>Required Texts</b>: All these texts with the exception of Whitman
are at <b>Talking Leaves.</b>

the Manuscript Books will be on reserve in the library.  There you can

Ended, ere it begun--
The title was scarcely told
When the Preface perished from Consciousness
The Story, unrevealed--

Had it been mine, to print!
Had  it been yours, to read!
That it was not Our privilege
The interdict of God--
              __                   Dickinson  (1860s)

They say that "Time assuages"--
Time never did assuage--
An actual suffering strenghens
As sinews do, with age--

Time is a Test of Trouble--
But not a Remedy--
If such it prove, it prove too
There was no Malady--
                                   Dickinson (1860s)

The Ancient of Days forever is young,
   Forever the scheme of Nature thrives;
I know a wind in purpose strong--
   It spins against  the way it drives,
What if the gulfs their slimed foundations bare?
So deep must the stones be hurled
Whereon the throes of ages rear
The final empire and the happier world.
                     _____    

                            Melville, "The Conflict of Convictions" (1866)

Word over all, beautiful as the sky,
Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time
      be utterly lost,
That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly
     softly wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world; 
                    ______ 
                          
                           Whitman, "Reconciliation" (1865)


Still the walls do not fall,
I do not know why;

there is zrr-hiss,
lightning in a not-known,

unregistered dimension;
we are powerless,

dust and power fill our lungs
our bodies blunder

through doors twisted on hinges,
and the lintels slant

cross-wise;
we walk continually

on thin air
that thickens to a blind fog,

then step swiftly aside,
for even the air

is independable,
thick where it should be fine

and tenuous 
where wings separate and open,

and the ether
is heavier than the floor,

and the floor sags
like a ship floundering;

we know no rule
of procedure,

we are voyagers, discoverers
of the not-known

the unrecorded;
we have no map;

possibly we will reach haven,
heaven. 
        ____    H.D. The Walls do not Fall  (1942)


The dove descending breaks the air
With flame of incandescent terror
Of which the tongues declare
The one discharge from sin and error.
The only hope, or else despair
    Lies in the choice of pyre or pyre--
    To be redeemed from fire by fire.
                     
           T.S. Eliot   Little Gidding   (1943)

Soldier, there is a war between the mind
And sky, between thought and day and night.  It is
For that the poet is always in the sun,

Patches the moon together in his room
To his Virgilian cadences, up down,
Up down. It is a war that never ends. 
                  
           Stevens,   "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction"  (1947)

Soldier's Song:
(Sioux)
Over the earth I come;
Over the earth I come;
   A soldier I come;
Over the earth I am a ghost.
