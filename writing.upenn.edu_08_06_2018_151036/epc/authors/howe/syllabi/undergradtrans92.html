From my earliest years I have had a feeling of Dislike & Disgust
connected with my own Christian Name: such a vile short plumpness,
such a dull abortive smartness in the first Syllable, & this so
harshly contrasted by the obscurity and indefiniteness of the syllable
Vowel, and the feebleness of the uncovered liquid, with which it
ends-- the wabble it makes, & staggering between a diss--& a
tri-syllable--& the whole names sounding as if you were
abeeceeing. S.M.U.L. --although it is perhaps the worst combination,
of which vowels & consonants are susceptible.
                  
                                               Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

TALES OF TRANSGRESSION AND OR MONSTROSITY:
STUDIES IN GENRE: ENG 429.
T TH 11:00-12:20. Professor Susan Howe.</b>
<hr noshade width=350 align=left>

We will read a number of British and American short stories, poems and
short novels, most of them written during the 19th century, and
perhaps see two films.  These writings and films focus on traditional
gothic themes of transgression and monstrosity but they remain outside
that genre form.

<b>Poems:</b> Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner," Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market," Robert Browning's
"Porphyria's Lover," and "My Last Duchess," Edgar Allan Poe's "The
Raven," "The City in the Sea," "Alone."

<b>Short novels and short stories.</b> Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, or
the Modern Prometheus, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Nathaniel
Hawthorne's "Ethan Brand," "Wakefield," "Rappaccini's Daughter,"
"Edgar Allan Poe's "William Wilson, A Tale," Herman Melville's "Benito
Cereno,"and "Bartleby the Scrivener." Henry James' The Turn of the
Screw.

<b>Films:</b> Night of the Hunter, story by James Agee, director
Charles Laughton, The Third Man, story by Graham Greene, director
Carol Reed.

Attendance is Mandatory.  After three absences your grade will be
automatically lowered to a B-. Lecture and class
discussion. Discussion is important. I will sometimes ask for one page
summaries of some aspect of the reading.  Two short exams and a final
10-15 page paper.
