<blockquote>
Though we wander about,<br>
find no honey of flowers in this waste,<br>
is our task the less sweet--<br>
who recall the old splendour,<br>
await the new beauty of cities?<br>
<br>
The city is peopled<br>
with spirits, not ghosts, O my love:<br>
<br>
Though they crowded between<br>
and usurped the kiss of my mouth<br>
their breath was your gift,<br>
their beauty,  your life.<br><br>
                              H.D. from "Cities"  (Sea Gardens)

Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world.  A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man and all the instruments and books of the earth and all reasoning. 
<p>
The great poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been and is. He drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their feet. . . . he says to the past, Rise and walk before me that I may realize you. He learns the lesson. . .  . he places himself where the future becomes present.

  <font size=5>W</font>e will begin by examining the literature of Puritan New England.  During the 17th century, women, figured as converts, heretics, captives, goodwives, and witches.; indeed Puritan women and young girls were simultaneously  represented as embodiments of exemplary virtue and deplorable deviance. We will explore a variety of genres--conversion narratives, captivity narratives, heresiographies, trial transcripts, diaries. <br>
   During the second half of the semester will concentrate on the powerful subliminal influence these issues and texts exert on certain 19th century American works. Concentration will be on primary texts but I want to enter our discussions of Hawthorne, Dickinson, and James via two books: Jonathan Crary's Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Nineteenth Century,  and Sexuality and Space, edited by Beatriz Colomina.

                                    The dead
are the departed therefrom.    Whose
leavings.   Reading we partake of.
A lamp of letters, a ladder of
                        divine signs,
a substance of ourselves lost,   lost
in a world lost waste lost that we must gather        
                         out. 

       Set like a crying girl to sift cinders
out of old passions.     For a first fire.
    For a light in old age to burn in the skull
       that lit youth's loins?
       Covetous brain!

        But read further,      read  further.
Beloved Shakespeare,  beloved Lao Tse,
         beloved Virginia Woolf!
         My heart is submerged as I read.

         Above:
         the swarming radiance.

These that I never saw I see.

         Below:
          the boundless waters. 
                              
                                 "The Human Communion.  Traces"
