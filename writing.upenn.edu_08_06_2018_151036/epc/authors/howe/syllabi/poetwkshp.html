<b>American Poetry--Workshop. Professor Susan
Howe.  Spring Semester. 1995. English 339. Wednesday
2pm-5:00pm. Clemens 19.  </b> <p>
  Although this class will be primarily a writing workshop, we will
carefully read books by some individual contemporary poets and fiction
writers. These writers will be coming to campus as part of the
Wednesday at 4 Plus Series. We will attend these readings as part of
the class. The following authors in the series will visit our
workshops and we will discuss one book by each of them in advance of
their visit to UB. You can buy the books at Talking Leaves Bookstore.

Zombie Notes .   Maureen Owen
Necromance .  Rae Armantrout
Rondeaux  .  Laura Moriarty 
Break it Down .   Lydia Davis. 

You are also required to read: 
Region of Unlikeness .  Jorie Graham.
The Invention of Solitude by Paul Auster
The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje


<b>Requirements:</b> A weekly response paper and a final chapbook of
poems or prose poems produced from work written during the
semester. The chapbook can consist of a collection of poems, a prose
poem, a short story, or an essay.

Regular attendance at the workshop and at the readings is
<b>mandatory.</b> Your grade will be lowered by half a point for each
workshop you miss. We will go over to the readings at the Screening
Room at 4 pm each Wednesday. That is also required. You must write a
response paper for these events so if you dont go there is a BIG
problem. There is a range of readers, poets, novelists, critics, and
films.

You will be expected to xerox a copy of the poems you are going to
read for each member of the class and distribute them on the day you
read or better still the week before. If you havent made copies for
each of us there is no point in your reading. Students will take their
copies of your work home and comment on them then return the marked
copies to you the following week.

I would like to see a poem a week from each of you .
