<blockquote>
"Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended  inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves.  Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world." 
<p>
"The winged words on which my soul would pierce<br>
Into the height of Love's rare Universe,<br>
Are chains of lead around its flight of fire--" (Shelley--"Epipsychidion")
<p>
You ask me what/my flowers said-/ then they were disobedient- I gave them messages-They said what the lips in the West, say, / when the sun goes/ down, and so says/ the Dawn--Listen again, Master-- (Dickinson 2nd Master Letter)
			                   <p>

<b>Requirements:</b>
<p>
1.  <b>Each week a written reaction--typed-- a page or two--brief-</b>-to the reading or to class discussion from week before.  These can be in the form of a poem, a list of quotations, a discussion with me or with the discussion and this seminar it could also included an edited version of a Dickinson poem with your reasons for the way you have chosen to edit it--the written reaction could also be to the Shelley Manuscripts--this offers you a lot of freedom to experiment but is not meant to be time consuming.  Two copies of these please.  One for me and one that I can put into a packet for each of you to read if you wish.  
<p>
2.  <b>One class presentation.  At least 15 minutes long</b>.  (not more than 25 min)  We will discuss these during our first meeting.  During this seminar it would be helpful to have some of you explore general theories  of textual practise, others might like to concentrate on one poem--a close reading and attempt at editing it--a history of the editing of one particular poem.  Or some essay on poetics applied to ideas we are exploring.   The presentation can also be the beginnings of your final paper.  
<p>
3.  <b>One final paper 15-20 pages.</b>  
<p>
I am trying something new this seminar and am in the process of following ideas myself.  What I am concerned with is the idea of originality, final versions, what gets lost when a poem enters into a political economy of values, what is found, what it means to be a visionary poet--is there such a thing?  How does editing change a poem?  There aren't that many markers or sources so we will add things as we find them.  Therefore I can't supply a definitive reading list for each week.   I have xeroxed a master copy of fascicle 31,  but you can also obtain your own and you will have to make your own copies of the other poems we read.  from the Franklin edition on reserve.   You will have to match the Johnson versions to the Franklin. 
<p>
