Mayakovsky has an essay called "How to Write Poems" where he says that
a poet must spend time and effort choosing the uniquely appropriate
words, force them into the rhythm of the poem and then "test it out
loud" ten times or more. Vertov did something very similar at the
editing table. A hundred tests, a thousand different variants, endless
numbers of try-outs--for meaning, for imagery, for rhythm--and
finally, after long intensive efforts, that feeling of joy: it
works. . .
                                            ---Elizaveta Svilova

                          Capture, don't reconstruct.
                                      ---Eric von Stroheim 

What is a word in relation to a moving picture?  What is 1995 in relation to
1918?  This course will be an investigation of poetics by way of
cinema. Using two or three films directed and written by Chris Marker,
La Jetee (1962), and Sans Soleil (1982), and hopefully- -The Train
Rolls On (portrait of Alexander Medvedkin) (1972), as a starting
point, we will consider films that mix documentary footage with
fiction, historical fact with memory.  There will be some secondary
reading material, but this is not a course in academic film
study. Rather we will explore some relations between the way film and
poems work with facts. We will read these productions the way we read
poems.  Marker's two films are inspired, among other things, by
Vertov's iconoclastic enthusiasm. They are also haunted by the
disaster of WWII, and by the ironies of making art in the wake of
those years without hope.  We will concentrate on films (fiction and
non- fiction) some of them in turn haunted by WWI .  Esther Shub's The
Fall of the Romanov Dynasty (1927), Dziga Vertov's The Man with the
Movie Camera (1928), Three Songs About Lenin (1934), Leni
Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1934), Jean Renoir's Rules of the
Game (1939), John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro (1945), Humphrey
Jennings, Listen To Britain (1942-47), Georges Franju's Blood of the
Beasts (1949, Alain Resnais' Night and Fog (1955), Hiroshima Mon
Amour, (1959), Andrei Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood, (1962), Mirror
(1965) , Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove: Or how I learned to stop
worrying and loved the Bomb. (1963) perhaps Marker's The Last
Bolshevik (1990).  <hr> <b>Requirements:</b> Each student will be
expected to research and introduce one of the films, and to write a
15-20 page final essay.  A weekly written response to the films will
also be expected.  The written responses are important.  Underlined
books should be at Talking Leaves. Unfortunately the Vertov and
Virilio (War and Cinema) are out of stock so you will have to rely on
the library where they should be on reserve.

under them--I climb on them--I am on the head of a galloping horse--I
burst at full speed into a crowd--I run before running soldiers--I
throw myself down with the aeroplanes--I fall and I fly at one with
the bodies falling or rising through the air.

                                               --Dziga Vertov, <b>1918 </b>.

LET  Magazine
                                
I am the ghost of Shadwell Stair,
  Along the wharves by the water-house,
  And through the cavernous slaughter-house,
I am the shadow that walks there.

Yet I have flesh both firm and cool,
  And eyes tumultuous as the gems
  Of moons and lamps in the full Thames
When dusk sails wavering down the Pool.

Shuddering, a purple street-arc burns
  Where I watch always. From the banks
  Dolorously the shipping clanks.
And after me a strange tide turns.

I walk till the stars of London wane,
  And dawn creeps up the Shadwell Stair.
  But when the crowning sirens blare,
I with another ghost am lain.
