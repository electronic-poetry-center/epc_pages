        the 1989 Susan Howe issue of The Difficulties, indented paragraphs made 
        up of phrases, separated by dashes, taken from her published work: &quot;Chanting 
        at the Crystal Sea&quot; (1975), Secret History of the Dividing Line (1979), 
        The Liberties (1980), Pythagorean Silence (1982), Defenestrotion of Prague 
        (1984), My Emily Dickinson (1985), &quot;The Captivity and Restoration 
        of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson&quot; (1985), &quot;Women and Their Effect in 
        the Distance&quot; (1986), &quot;Heliopathy&quot; (1986), &quot;Thorow&quot; 
        (1987), &quot;Federalist 10&quot; (1987), Articulation of Sound Forms 
        in Time (1987). Again, with the &quot;Tips for Totalizers&quot; mapping 
        as its vertebrae, with a nod toward the treatments of &quot;suture&quot; 
        in film studies and post-structuralist political theory.</font></p>

        insistently embodies an engaged (wonderfully engaging) alternative to 
        the maps &amp; scale models of power &amp; subjecthood it poses, exposes,

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ideology 
        works through the construction of subjects, by positioning, by address

        in a similar (compulsory) itinerary. (But not in the body of work at hand.)</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ideology 
        succeeds as ventriloquism. The subject/reader gets a subjectively subjected 
        (or subjectedly subjective) ego &#151; a structured character. Out of 
        this imaginary relation, finds herself constructed as a unified whole 
        by identifying with a centralizing imagery, a unifying reflection; as 
        if in a mirror, doubling the amnesias &amp; repressions of the text.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
        in film, as in film theory, the fixing (&amp; reassuring) of spectators 
        occurs through suturing: stitching, fills in, like a wound's lips surgically 
        sewn. We are authorized to see only what a second, ghosted spectator can 
        see &#151; 'the absent one' &#151; through a shot/reverse shot sequence 
        &amp; continuity editing. First shot: we see the field, the protagonist: 
        we see what an 'absent one' sees. Second, the reverse shot clarifies (&amp; 
        ideologizes): that 'look of nobody' is wiped out by a depiction of someone 
        who occupies that place (who possesses the field in shot I). We see the 
        second character as if from the (neutral) place &amp; point of view of 
        the protagonist. Optical point of view in film (in so-called 'dominant 
        cinema') produces a subject in place of that absence. We 'stand in' for 
        the absent second character &#151; 'nobody's look' becomes somebody's; 
        absence becomes presence as voyeurism works as a form of identification. 
        When the first protagonist is shown again, the gap is sutured, the absence 
        sewn up &#151; &amp; the reader/viewer comes to be' a glancing, eavesdropping 
        subject. The reverse shot: a mirror, identified with the audience, whose 
        members identify (as individuals) with the producer (the writer, the camera).</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
        the official versions of 'high modernism', the reader is addressed by 
        the text's own formalized self-sufficiency, its outsidelessness: hermetically 
        sealed, indifferent to the reader s presence in social discourse, but, 
        figuring her to be missing, encourages her voyeurism. Ideology's medusa 
        gaze.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such 
        texts create an absence by their inability to come fully to grips with 
        language &amp; discourse &#151; an absence of the social, a gap, which 
        the reader is to fill in (or suture), also without going through the circuit 
        (&amp; intrication) of language. The reader has a stand-in &#151; the 
        author: fixing her within the self-enclosures (&amp; seeming personal 
        possessions) of the text. And this formalist absence of the social can 
        fix the reader as complicit &amp; coherent stand-in. This is a containment, 
        sealing the reader within the self-referring moment of the author's sovereignty 
        (a reverse shot &#151; resurrecting the ab-<br>
        sence in the position of the writer, reappropriating it inside the frames 
        of the text itself &amp; naturalizing those social frames).</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        author, if its moves are conventionalized enough, is so discreet &amp; 
        ghostly &#151; a sovereign absent one, authorizing what of the social 
        figuration the reader can experience yet absenting or covering up the 
        bodily, social place (&amp; method) out of which meanings are processed. 
        It naturalizes the figurative &amp; the rhetorical, by speaking impersonally, 
        hiding its 'enunciatory work' with the help of a reader 'sewn' into the 
        text. The absence (of production) is effaced, or filled in; the monadic 
        reader (the basic suture) experiencing epiphanies of presence before a 
        self-enclosed formalist space, by an identification with an absence (or 
        a 'making imaginary') of the social. This helps guarantee a smoothed, 
        antisocial address; it allows the process of construction of the subject 
        &#151; a multiplicity of social intersections &#151; to be forgotten. 
        Instead, the subject/reader takes shape &amp; finds its place as consumer; 
        it allows the author a sovereignty over discourse so that social norms 
        become the subject's dream.</font></p>
