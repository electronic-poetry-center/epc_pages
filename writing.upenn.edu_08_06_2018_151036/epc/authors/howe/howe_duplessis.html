        Howe takes the experimentalist desire for interrogation of the mark and 
        combines it with the populist mysteries of such oblique and marginalized 
        materials as folk tales and early American autobiography and fuses these 
        under the complex and resonant sign of human femaleness. Her work with 
        its minimalist elegance and economy of gesture is also charged with social 
        density, in her critical allusions to our common culture (Swift, Yeats, 
        Shakespeare), and in her austere judgments of the shared political and 
        ethical destructions of our experience - the liquidation of Native Americans, 
        of Jews in the Holocaust, the rack of Ireland. She has felt the inflection 
        of victor by loser, of other by winner, and these subtle dialectics of 
        power create her subtle political diction. Her words, sometimes broken 
        even into a magical &quot;zaum&quot; tactic, can draw upon lost words 
        or non-dominant languages (Gaelic, Native American languages): her poems 
        are repositories of the language shards left in a battlefield over cultural 
        power. (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT1">1</a><a name="Ref1"></a>)</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Howe 
        chooses to have her making a mark bounded by two Marks to whom this book 
        is dedicated: her father and her son. Inscriptions and depths. Perhaps 
        the secret history of the dividing line is its situational quality, a 
        boundary explored between groups whose differences seem marked, but whose 
        fusions and mutual yearnings the poetry seems to enact: tribe to tribe; 
        generation to generation (adult to child, father to daughter); male to 
        female; dead to living. Howe plays on a basic myth of the hero, or the 
        father&#151;something from which the searching daughter feels alien, something 
        for which the searching daughter feels desire. Thus the air-grasping syllables, 
        encoding the word hero in anguished slow motion:</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Howe 
        makes works which seem to distill the quintessence of traditional lyric 
        poetry, its luminous greeny white sap-filled songs. This essence she tests 
        and recreates by projecting the lyric into the hardly populated vastness 
        and silence of modern page space. She works in issues of transcendence&#151;as 
        possibility, but also as impossible political privilege. Of &quot;feigning&quot; 
        and the sincerities of artifice. She works between abstract thought and 
        precisions of image. She maintains a Woolfean admiration for the odd and 
        quirky, the resistant and wayward. (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT2">2</a><a name="Ref2"></a>) And makes fruitful a subtle play between 
        determinate meaning and indeterminacy: a woman&#151;a person mainly gendered 
        female&#151;writing &quot;feminine&quot; discourses, knowing and rewriting 
        &quot;masculine&quot; discourses, in the name of a feminist and critical 
        cultural project which wants to transcend gender. This project colossal 
        in its hybris. In its unsettling. Howe has pointed to the ambition in 
        an interview. She reads a quotation from Aquinas: &quot; 'Pythagoras said 
        that all things were divisible into two genera, good and evil; in the 
        genus of good things he classified all perfect things such as light, males, 
        repose, and so forth, whereas in the genus of evil he classed darkness, 
        females and so forth.' In reaction to that, I wrote 'Promethean aspiration: 
        To be a Pythagorean and a woman.' &quot; (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT3">3</a><a name="Ref3"></a>)</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
        &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (Part I of <i>Pythagorean Silence</i>) the reader 
        receives simultaneously the historical reference of violence of disasters 
        of war&#151; of attacks and provocations, and an imagistic sense of billowy, 
        nacreous, sheltering space and sound. Here, too, contradictions in the 
        luminous vulnerability of the emotional terrain: a He and She whose perspectives 
        differ as vastly as does judgment from mourning. The poet replays shadowy 
        scenes, for &quot;Only / what never stops hurting remains / in memory.&quot; 
        She tries (in a maneuver reminiscent of many quest plots of many women 
        writers) to come to terms with a &quot;pure and severe&quot; and absent 
        male quester, later seen as &quot;Possession my father,&quot; and a time 
        when &quot;midday or morrow / move motherless&quot; (i.e., &quot;Poverty 
        my mother&quot;) Can one construct &quot;parents&quot; adequate to female 
        ambition from these raw materials? This is done in the plangent voice 
        of the child daughter or soul, working into voice until &quot;biography 
        blows away&quot; and she has simply distilled the pure essence of some 
        story (say: quest, knife, ivy; the hunt, the dream, the shadow, the spindle).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Building 
        upon this psychological and familial work, all of Howe's writing also 
        does spiritual and metaphysical work yet without the authoritarian or 
        prophetic claims that often accompany this practice. For instance, Howe 
        will produce a text which draws on the reading of deeply felt markings, 
        signs seen under pressure, signs in the typological sense. With her interest 
        in the anti-authoritarian mark, Howe's work can be seen as a fruitful 
        juncture between H.D. and Oppen. That practice of H D which centers most 
        noticeably in <i>Tribute to Freud</i> rests upon the uncloseable reading 
        of signs; word. gesture, memory and dream are all glyphs for an infiniating 
        practice of decoding. That practice of Oppen which speaks of the lengthy 
        preliminary work done to find one word creating the small space to &quot;stand 
        on&quot;; such poetic practice makes islands of clarity or necessity thrown, 
        like the Whitmamc &quot;filament, filament,&quot; into the surrounding 
        mystery. As in Oppen, Howe's work can show little interest in the connectedness 
        of syntax, and more in the spaces of silence, the electricities of awe. 
        The syntactic mode Howe favors? &quot;Paper anacoluthon and naked chalk&quot;&#151;anacoluthon 
        being a lack of grammatical sequence or coherence. [<i>ASFT</i>, p. [50])</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
        one of many favorite genres (all Howe's genres exist in transparently 
        matted palimpsests) is something like the ode which lifts things to limitlessness, 
        whose main debate is between overwhelming boundlessness (like the sea 
        of death in Lawrence's &quot;Ship of Death&quot;) (like the &quot;more 
        happy love. more happy, happy love&quot; with the verbal excess in Keats' 
        &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;) and some vulnerable boundary which may 
        compromise ultimates of song, of bliss, of void. In Howe one feels the 
        loft the heft, the debate of the ode, the apostrophes of power, of self-questioning. 
        The persistent ground of &quot;alterity, anonymity, darkness.&quot; (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT4">4</a><a name="Ref4"></a>) 
        All concepts coded feminine. As the ode, as genre, may be&#151;the ode, 
        as the genre which symbolizes poetry in its ecstasy, its poetic diction, 
        its excessive, overblown, portentious, mellifluous scale. The ode's appeal 
        to the sublime, its sense of boundariless dissolutions, its febrile outcries 
        are also coded feminine: hysteria, emotionalism, exaggeration, the sense 
        of an ecstatic dance on the boundaries of the sensible. If there is a 
        female practice of the ode (different from male writers) it may lie in 
        the indirection needed to examine the site of female ecstasy from the 
        peculiar perspective of the seeker and the sought&middot;the desirous 
        orgasmic, ambitious mother and the &quot;incestuous,&quot; ambitious writer 
        who appropriates those visceral ambitions. And while much of Howe is ode-like 
        perhaps the most startling ode is her prose critical study <i>My Emily 
        Dickinson</i>&middot;her passionate and vital exploration of the history 
        of literature and the political context of Dickinson as American woman 
        writer. But all genres are plumbed by the scrupulous lead of Howe's mark. 
        The protocols of genre fermented by her mapping, weeping eye.</font></p>

        her? and who is she? if the female speck in the history of texts. And 
        she is the scout of its presence. The roaming vagrant one, the errancy, 
        the &quot;Thorow&quot;&#151; thrown like a die into the game of culture's 
        chances, thrown out but thorough and pertinacious. Evoked, claimed is 
        Thoreau, the watcher the condenser of phrases, the one who knows the mystery

        as quarry is stubborn, before the end, and she is stubborn for quarries 
        disappeared. The knife may slay, one voice be quelled. But Howe is driven 
        to hear the condensed and impacted operas of the Others, the ones about 
        whom few orators speak, the ones few encyclopaedists commemorate the ones 
        massacred, the ones of smoke. Iphegenia. Ophelia. Flora. Psyche Little 
        &quot;humanchild.&quot; Operas of rage could be made. What genre is adequate

        Howe&#146;s answer: &quot;Blank. It would be blank. It would be a white 
        canvas. White.&quot; (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT5">5</a><a name="Ref5"></a>) To write: to be caught in hopeless joy between black 
        and white, said and unsaid, between the overwritten and underwritten between 
        desire and obliteration. Divided in language, but speaking the language. 
        How to draw these signs on whiteness, how to incise words formed in imbeddings, 
        words with the fused detritus of all their imbeddings. Reading up and 
        reading down, reading back and forth across</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        ground can never be cleared of the prior. It saturates us&#151;political 
        powers, social places, duties, infusions of norms, irruptions of protest. 
        Thus the sign is never empty, it is never EMPTY; it is full, fused and 
        jostling, an active &quot;stage for struggle&quot; (as Bakhtin says, somewhere). 
        Howe's innovations on the page, her sculptural sketches of signs, make 
        a poetics of her responsibility to and in this multiple struggle. This 
        &quot;I&quot; in the text is a wraithe seeking the wraithe sought; she 
        is, Howe says, the &quot;Scholiast.&quot; The Scholiast! strange word, 
        which means annotator. Writer of notes on margins of canonized texts. 
        An ancient commentator on an ancient author. &quot;Some clue.&quot; A

        subtle and prolix with genres ?) In terms of the social territories evoked, 
        ballads are the obverse of at least encyclopedias, epics, histories, orations. 
        Possibly philosophies. And all texts have had strong bonds with power

        watch, to follow the wraithe on the margins into her centers that are

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 
        important, underutilized essay of Gertrude Stein argues implicitly that 
        experimentalist writing occurs in opposition to &quot;forensics,&quot; 
        and in temptation by it. The mastery and the power. (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT7">7</a><a name="Ref7"></a>) 
        That loaded word is also the title of her essay; it alludes to discourses 
        of dominance. Forensics (defined conventionally as public argumentation, 
        formal debate, presentations of law courts) is understood as the dialect, 
        ideolect, or rhetorical mode of a specific group which holds and practices 
        power (&quot;they made all walk&quot;), social replication (&quot;forensics 
        is a taught paragraph&quot;) and definition. For Stein, forensics is a 
        system of normative definition, which, in the imposition of authoritative 
        norms, trains one to patterns of assumptions (including those of gender). 
        &quot;Forensics establishes which is that they will rather than linger 
        and so they establish&quot; (p. 391). The writer of &quot;Forensics,&quot; 
        the she seems to be debating the value, if any, of forensics to her&#151;forensics 
        as disputation, as power, as definition, as &quot;eloquence and reduction&quot; 
        (p. 386). Among other functions, this essay, therefore, is a debate between 
        authority and the anti-authoritarian. (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT8">8</a><a name="Ref8"></a>) 
        It is clear enough that complicity, obedience, agreement, and renunciation 
        of one's own bent are part of the system of forensics. The question is 
        &quot;how to write&quot; (to borrow the title of the whole book which 
        this essay completes) when the writing space is colonized by forensics. 
        How to gather authority without authoritarian power; how to indicate clarities 
        without the limitation of certainties; how to give and receive pleasure 
        without rhetorical or generic proscriptions; how to indicate one's volume 
        without squatting hibernations of mass. <i>How to Write</i>. This, Gertrude 
        Stein indicates, is her problem; this, Virginia Woolf indicates, is her 
        problem; this, Marianne Moore indicates, is her problem; this, Susan Howe 
        indicates, is her problem.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Howe 
        bases her poetics on the evocation or proposition of &quot;silence&quot; 
        or &quot;a white canvas. White&quot; as a trope for an anti-authoritarian 
        practice. The foregrounding of otherness. The critique of centers, hierarchies, 
        authorities. The suspicion of dominant meaning. The apprehension of power. 
        The claim of power via critique. The seductions of dominant meaning scored 
        with suspicion. And, often this has a gender valence. As in Howe's essay 
        &quot;The Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson&quot; in which 
        Howe proposes a truth (specific, suffered, female) in opposition to Truth 
        (official, a &quot;masculine covenant&quot; [p. 116]). Indeed, Howe uses 
        this important essay to locate gender differences in both the production 
        and the consumption of a text. She analyzes the duplicity of the female 
        text (&quot;each time an errant perception skids loose, she controls her 
        lapse&quot;) which can at once &quot;confirm orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;subvert&quot; 
        [p. 117).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
        someone situated on borders between allegiances, as someone who eschews 
        what she perceives as untempered affiliations, Howe has had sometimes 
        provocative relations to varieties of contemporary feminism. For instance, 
        she is notably unimpressed by the discussion of Dickinson in Gilbert and 
        Cubar's <i>The Madwoman in the Attic</i> (cf. <i>MED</i>). In the 1986 
        interview, Howe spells out explicitly the analytic and cultural danger 
        she sees in reiterating a paradigm of the semi-conscious, mad woman artist: 
        the end in breakdown, disability, death too easily acceptable as a script.&quot; 
        (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT9">9</a><a name="Ref9"></a>) The Falon interview makes starkly 
        clear what was at stake in this received paradigm (which <i>Madwoman</i> 
        did not, of course, begin, and which, in my view it analyzed; but which 
        in Howe's view, it perpetuated). Howe speaks of her own fear of being 
        an artist based on her apprehension that madness and breakdown were the 
        retributive punishment for ambition. Tremendous psychic struggles are 
        revealed in Howe's persistent linkage of &quot;the bond between mad and 
        made&quot; (<i>ASFT</i>, p. [46]). The apparent insanity of other women 
        artists blocked her from her own declarations; to struggle against such 
        received interpretations of other women artists by analyses of their intellectual 
        breadth was to struggle for one's own ambition and achievement, at once 
        an act of cultural criticism and of personal necessity. Fundamentally, 
        Howe is mounting a critique of the tendency of <i>The Madwoman in the 
        Attic</i> to a &quot;victimization&quot; hypothesis, which underplayed 
        the agency of women. Yet despite this attack, Howe is notably feminist. 
        Whowe? She is concerned with the unspoken stories, the unsung songs: &quot;I 
        wish I could tenderly lift from the dark side of history, voices that 
        are anonymous, slighted&#151;inarticulate.&quot; (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT10">10</a><a name="Ref10"></a>) 
        She maintains the historical consciousness of the Creonesque politics 
        of violence and self-justification; her response, quite similar to Woolf's: 
        &quot;Malice dominates the history of Power and Progress. History is the 
        record of winners. Documents were written by the Masters. But fright is 
        formed by what we see not by what they say.&quot; (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT11">11</a><a name="Ref11"></a>) 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Howe 
        maintains an uncompromising suspicion of power and a subversive response, 
        subversive &quot;of powers and control and order.&quot; (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT12">12</a><a name="Ref12"></a>) 
        Like the Woolfean paradoxes of women's writing articulated in <i>A Room 
        of One's Own</i>, Howe offers the parallel analysis of a gendered writing 
        beyond gender. A series of citations show the full arc of the paradox. 
        &quot;A poet is never just a woman or a man. Every poet is salted with 
        fire&quot; (<i>MED</i>, p. 7). &quot;There's a time of poetry and a mastery 
        about it that transcends chronological time and gender, and that . . . 
        has its own time and its own gender&quot; (Falcon interview, p. 28). &quot;Yet 
        gender difference does affect our use of language, and we constantly confront 
        issues of difference, distance and absence, when we write&quot; (<i>MED</i>, 
        p. 13).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Importantly, 
        she is a feminist by virtue of her rage, including her rage at the itaisappropriation 
        (as she sees it) of a woman writer&#151;in the case of Gilbert and Gubar, 
        by women; in the case of the mis- editing of Emily Dickinson, by men. 
        (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT13">13</a><a name="Ref13"></a>) The rage of Howe, the brilliant, 
        lacerating indignation is a steely motive. In the 1986 interview, Howe 
        speaks of being released to rage by virtue of an exemplary feminist text: 
        the &quot;tremendous effect&quot; of the galvanic rage of Kate Millett's 
        (1969) work <i>Sexual Politics</i>; Howe's reading of Millett led her 
        to those changes in her paintings and environments (Howe was then a visual 
        artist) which in turn quickly provoked her to a drastic almost interdicted 
        change of medium&#151;into words, into writing, into articulation of sound 
        forms in time.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Howe 
        appears to be on the cusp between two feminisms: the one analyzing female 
        difference, the other &quot;feminine&quot; difference. For the latter, 
        she is close to Julia Kristeva, who evokes marginality, subversion, dissidence 
        as anti-patriarchal motives beyond all limits. Anything marginalized by 
        patriarchal order is, thus &quot;feminine&quot;; the &quot;feminine&quot; 
        position (which can be held by persons of both genders) is a privileged 
        place from which to launch an anti-authoritarian struggle. (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT14">14</a><a name="Ref14"></a>) The female 
        use of this &quot;feminine&quot; of marginality and the avant garde use 
        of this &quot;feminine&quot; of marginality are mutually reinforcing in 
        the work of some contemporary women: Lyn Hejinian, Kathleen Fraser, Beverly 
        Dahlen and Howe. This mixed allegiance will naturally call into question 
        varieties of flat-footed feminism. Just as Woolf continually proposes 
        political and cultural feminism and the critical position of homosexuality, 
        yet satirically portrays monomanical reformers and colonizers of otherness 
        (suffragists and lesbians among them), so Howe continually proposes at<br>
        least a feminism of cultural critique while declaring strong opposition 
        whenever she suspects unitary (undialectical, uncritical) feminist enthusiasm. 
        The only danger is that Howe's precise kind of feminism may be misread 
        by a- or anti-feminist commentators.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certainly 
        <i>The Liberties</i> cannot be misunderstood in its approach to the question 
        of women's representation in culture. This major work from 1980 (first 
        published with, but unrelated to <i>The Defenestration of Prague</i>) 
        begins with, and returns to the tie between Stella and ]on. Swift. Howe 
        makes her own &quot;liquidation&quot;&#151;payment of a debt, assessment 
        of liabilities and assets&#151;in analyzing Swift's &quot;liquidation&quot;&#151;abolishing, 
        metaphoric killing of Stella. Swift abolished things about his life-long 
        companion, documents, artifacts, writings, for none of Stella's letters, 
        few of her poems, and no portrait has survived. Stella is therefore taken 
        by Howe as an absolute baseline of women's cultural condition: although 
        she had a fairly bold life, she has been historically obliterated, liquidated. 
        Although Howe has mentioned that the title The Liberties alludes to a 
        particular neighborhood in Dublin rich with cultural layers, yet one might 
        easily hear an echo of Swift's elegant epitaph, translated from Latin 
        by Yeats. &quot;He served human liberty.&quot; Male liberties are preserved 
        and eloquently assembled; female liberties though equally forceful are 
        with greater difficulty disentangled from guilt, pain, loss, obliteration. 
        Howe's work is written against the grain of such liquidation, to examine 
        and assess a Stella, a Cordelia, who, how: whowe.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        is a play, a masque in which Stella and Cordelia meet to piece together 
        their stories and identify what they have in common. Obliteration. Their 
        quest is a trek, and these events occur: memory, intelligibility, muteness, 
        map-reading, ellipses, telling, explosive silences, interpreting traces, 
        emphasis shifted. They dress in boy's clothing: to be safer? to neutralize 
        their pain? to cross-dress into other subjectivities? at least to claim 
        the liberty of boys. What does one do when one feels the electric power 
        of language from the feminist margins of cultural credibility? Resistance, 
        refusal, austere respect commingled with lacerating grief, resistance 
        to the already-said of literature (to Swift, to Yeats, to Shakespeare), 
        a sounding of dominance with the mark lines that have dredged the margins. 
        Stella, Swift's friend and Cordelia from <i>King Lear</i> meet in the 
        wild-woods of Howe's page space: a space devoted, consecrated to marginality, 
        a page space that is a canvas of margins. Reading a book, they are examining 
        what is inside the book, what is outside:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Howe 
        has taken the responsibility of writing the book outside the book. Thus 
        rewriting the books we assumed we knew, against the grain of the most 
        precious canon: Shakespeare! Swift! Yeats! piecing together their story, 
        piecing together what they have in common, trying to answer Cordelia's 
        question &quot;Did we survive at all.&quot; They have in common their 
        vulnerability to the definitions of them by others' stories.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
        have a consciousness of violence, done to them, around them; violence 
        to the vulnerable is a repeated motif in Howe's work, and within her text, 
        often the quarry speaks. They recall phrases associated with their story 
        (Cordelia meditates upon &quot;speak again&quot;), but these are cited 
        only to be assessed. Recited they become different, voiced critically. 
        They have in common a female relation to dominant story, muted and trying 
        a voice, storied but claiming their telling. They investigate. They spy. 
        They scry. They wait.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whowe.&quot; 
        Sometimes the characters seem to be whole, but their integrated knowledge, 
        unstable, alternates with explosive silences, blackouts staged by Howe. 
        They panic. They are self-possessed. The dangerous dialectic of claiming 
        <i>made</i> from <i>mad/e</i> is a brilliant dramatic and intellectually 
        compelling site in this work. &quot;Surely [says Beverly Dahlen] she cannot 
        simply enter the tradition, identifying with it as if she were male; she 
        is, I think, in grave risk to do so. But what other identity is there? 
        Surely, to ask that is to bring us to the heart of the matter: woman as 
        absence and the consequent risks involved in the invention of our own 
        traditions.&quot; (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT15">15</a><a name="Ref15"></a>) A female 
        writer. A female writer faced with a complex (the tradition) more often 
        inimical than welcoming, and filled to brim, with multiplex inscriptions 
        of women and the female and the feminine. A female writer looking for 
        a way to write. How, indeed, to write. Whowe to write. The path Howe chooses 
        here, this examination of a fictional character, and a semi-fictionally 
        available historically attested person, bridges a way to the definition 
        of &quot;our own traditions&quot; to treat the palimpsested absence, filling 
        it with our (with whower) annotations and firm marks. Yet they are already 
        filled with what they establish; filled with taught paragraphs. Who we? 
        Who? How? Who howe (who is any of us) to attempt this? And whooo-wee&#151; 
        the cheer, the whoop, the enormous, outrageous pleasure, the pride, of 
        making this attempt. The pride in Howe occurs not so much in overt exclamations 
        of joy, but in gestures towards election.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Left 
        upon the stage at the end are versions of a community of seekers, versions 
        of the whowe: a sojourner, a lonely bastard, and a fool. It is this kind 
        of combination of marginals, fused into one, who becomes the center of 
        <i>Articulation of Sound Forms in Time</i>. For that work can be read 
        as an allegory of how the center, how major man&#151;white, colonist, 
        Protestant, male, minister, armed with God's word and courage and rectitude&#151;how 
        that man, entering almost accidentally some marginal space, goes from 
        the straight and narrow to sheer errancy, sheer wanderings. Mr. Hope Atherton, 
        militant new American, wanders on the margins of the colony at which he 
        was a center. His oblique vision and experience of the Other (&quot;Indian&quot;) 
        and himself as Other is forever defining. Following from Howe's study 
        of the margins as marginal (in <i>The Liberties</i>), <i>Articulation 
        of Sound Forms in Time</i> offers a vision of the center as marginal, 
        marginalized, prone to a hopeless&#151; yet potentially saving&#151;breakup 
        of its most cherished paradigms.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        deepest effect of this experience of otherness is the dissolution of language. 
        This work again fervently enacts Howe's language strategies. The isolation 
        of letter. Of syllable. Phrasal constructions. Word squares mingling Native 
        American words and word parts with phonemes from &quot;our&quot; language 
        (&quot;amonoosuck&quot; and &quot;ythian&quot;), these macronics making 
        an &quot;uncannunc&quot; set of nonce formations [<i>ASFT</i>, [p. 16]). 
        Words are situational, meteoric, unrepeatable, impacting the whole history 
        of language in one gesture. There is word &quot;play&quot;&#151;the pun 
        as the intersection of personal revelation (condensation, distortion) 
        and linguistic possibility. And all these (words as if graffiti puns, 
        macronics, words scattered like a handful of jacks) (words effaced; words 
        without space, as in Roman inscriptions) the critical appropriation of 
        all burlesque or archaic language habits for high critical ends. The taxing 
        struggle to assemble and maintain a self-questioning (who? how?) cultural 
        position: anti-authoritarian, yet authoritatively provoked by one's female 
        identity: Howe. We. WHOWE.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
        have taken my pun on Howe's name from herself, to point up the rich sense 
        of self and of community (who we?) that must be sustained to sustain this 
        kind of feminist critique. (<a href="howe_duplessis.html#FT16">16</a><a name="Ref16"></a>) 
        The end of <i>The Liberties</i> set a proof to herself. It consists of 
        a series of word squares alternating S and C (for Stella and Cordelia, 
        but also to herself: Susan, SEE!), followed by a series of riddles whose 
        answer becomes How: a question, a salutation, a hold, a hole, a depression. 
        Offering thereby an astonishing self-portrait of an artist, a woman, trying 
        to inherit herself, to work herself into her own&#151;&quot;patrimony&quot;? 
        &quot;anarchy&quot;? No, into her own &quot;liberty.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hence 
        a work of &quot;howness: both concavity and depth&quot; from a &quot;howdie: 
        a midwife, origin obscure&quot; who gave it life from the concavity and 
        the depth at once. &quot;Across the Atlantic, I / inherit myself.&quot; 
        During the masque at the very end, a Sentry comes on stage to say &quot;I 
        am afraid,&quot; as who would not be, having written, seen, undertaken, 
        dared and proposed such a work. A work which pursues Shakespeare (the 
        drama like a mix of heath scene and Beckett), Swift, Yeats, and <i>must 
        do so</i>, a compulsion (deference deranged, damaged, exploded by feminist 
        questions, by whowe) undertaken in fear and desire (&quot;dare / / tangle&quot;).

        In this essay, Howe examines the facsimile of Dickinson's fascicles and

        having her line breaks regularized and normalized visually to traditional 
        common meter when Dickinson's visual text and page presentation of her 
        poems in holograph are much more experimental, hesitant, anti-authoritarian
