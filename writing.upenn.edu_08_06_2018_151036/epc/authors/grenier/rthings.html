        Robert Grenier's Talk at SUNY/Buffalo, October 22, 1998</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"> Robert Grenier: 
        I don't know if it's the season &amp; the character of the day, but I 
        wanted to begin by sounding a ground note, which possibly was also influenced 
        by the fact that I actually saw a great many skeletons in doorways this 
        morning as I went on my run . . . along . . . it's hard not to keep in 
        mind all the time, in a way that's perhaps even eventually counter-productive, 
        what seems to be the condition of the world in these days in which, through 
        the various influences of global capitalism &amp; the population explosion 
        &amp; so on, one can see &amp; experience the world coming apart &amp; 
        'deconstructing' in one's very lifetime, so that for example the fact 
        that Robert Creeley -- whose spirit need not be invoked in this room -- 
        has been going on writing about getting older &amp; older, almost by the 
        minute, for what, 20 years now? -- when did that become a . . . ? -- so 
        &amp; of course that's a trope, &amp; that's true enough, &amp; I feel 
        it too, I'm almost as old as Charles Olson was when he went to Beloit, 
        Wisconsin to deliver his three lectures in 1968 when he was . . . &amp; 
        then he died shortly thereafter . . . but this business of focussing on 
        decay is not only an expression of the poet's subjectivity, a 'trope', 
        it's also, in Ralph Waldo Emerson's terms, a 'type', that is it's an image 
        of what comes from the outside, &amp; to be alive in these times is a 
        curious privilege . . . despite the fact that all seems to be well, &amp; 
        that there's enough room for quite a while yet, the fact of recognizing 
        what exists in time as <i>still alive</i> is pretty astounding &amp; so 
        . . . in that context, to quote Larry Eigner out of this book that Ben 
        Friedlander put together -- because I copped out of it, in part -- which 
        to me was uninteresting at the time because I was so used to his formulations, 
        having been around him so much -- "My eyes are too big for my head", "It's 
        all spontaneity", that sort of stuff was boring to me at that time -- 
        but now, when I see the careful articulation that's involved in a number 
        of these pieces, this is really, this has got great stuff in it (holds 
        up), <i>areas / lights / heights,</i> the poet Larry Eigner's notes &amp; 
        postcards &amp; jottings over a period of time that Ben Friedlander put 
        together, it's a great book . . . Larry would say something like, "About 
        98% of the world's experts would agree that . . . it's the end!" (laughs) 
        -- he wouldn't say that, I say that -- &amp;, but, obviously having said 
        that, <i>nothing happened </i>. . . &amp; they could say, you know, "The 
        end of the world is about us!" &amp; <i>nothing has happened,</i> so it's 
        probably claptrap! . . . nonetheless an image of the world as resource 
        for human exploitation is -- especially with the incredible 'organization' 
        that we now have, &amp; it'll be improved I'm sure, not only through such 
        agencies as the World-Wide Web but -- anyway, not to labor that circumstance, 
        which is tedious &amp;, if you dwell on it, would stop thought . . . I 
        think that the humans will be their,<i> the</i> last 'resource' -- &amp; 
        in firms now, of course, 'Human Resources' is a commonplace, I was once 
        one of those who was part of 'Human Resources' . . . now, having been 
        terminated from the position I held for 16 years in a large right-wing 
        corporate law firm in San Francisco, rather dramatically, with the other 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Charles Bernstein: 
        Is that opposed to 'a large left-wing corporate law firm'?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Sorry! 
        I'll try to get to the end of this tedious introduction soon -- on a day 
        in April, 1998, the seven of us were summoned to the 25th Floor, in an 
        <i>extensive</i>, &amp; really delightful new conference room that was 
        constructed at a certain cost, &amp; <i>terminated</i> . . . ever since 
        then, I'm 'out there' in a way that is a delight to me, we'll see what 
        happens -- &amp; so, to connect the parenthetical, if the world is a closed 
        system &amp; it's like that word I tried to look up but was too lazy to 
        find, 'ouroboros', 'snake that eats its tail', there're gonna be the people 
        around, &amp; the people themselves will eventually be the only 'Human 
        Resource' &amp; at that point I hope that we will begin to eat each other 
        (laughter), &amp; thus there will be some small extension of the possibility 
        of life on earth until . . . one can already imagine that the world <i>may</i> 
        be able to go on beyond us, but since that's all an imagination, I won't 
        speculate about that -- in that kind of 'gloomy' . . . circumstance, as 
        a ground bass, I would propose today for consideration -- &amp; I encourage 
        you to <i>speak</i> &amp; help me out on this, cause I'm trying to formulate 
        a response to a 'call for papers', in effect, to celebrate the longtime 
        scholarly &amp; human existence of a former teacher of mine who's been 
        at Stanford for many years who's retiring, his name is Albert J. Gelpi, 
        among other things he has to date written two of his proposed three-volume 
        history of American poetry -- <i>The Tenth Muse</i> is the first one,<i> 
        A Coherent Splendor</i>, about the passage into Modernism, is the second 
        . . . they're salutary texts, which 'set the standard', for me, for possible 
        discussion of work in the field -- he's a very <i>dear</i> <i>man</i> 
        &amp; instrumental to my survival at Harvard College years ago (1964-65) 
        in a course called The Poet In America -- but anyway, despite this <i>gloomy</i> 
        fact -- which I may be exaggerating? -- I'm interested &amp; have been 
        interested, in my attempt to go back, to do an account of '<i>my</i>' 
        development, strangely -- again thinking that I better get started, because 
        I'm getting so old . . again in relation to Charles Olson's <i>Poetry 
        &amp; Truth</i> lectures at Beloit when he was 58 or thereabouts -- the 
        idea proposed in Emerson's essay "The Poet" -- in fact previous to that, 
        for me, in the two books which are like this (holds up two fingers together) 
        from the twenties, which were integral to my understanding when I was 
        growing up, Lawrence's <i>Studies In Classic American Literature</i> &amp; 
        Williams' <i>In The American Grain</i> which, as Horace Gregory indicates 
        in his thirties' introduction to the Williams book, are 'discredited, 
        personal projections on history' but together the two books call for an 
        idea of 'the new world', a 'new world' . . . &amp; that America is 'the 
        new world', &amp; in the Williams book, those of you who have read it 
        would know, the idea of Columbus coming to the first, to the beginning, 
        to the island, &amp; the locals greeting him &amp; the flora &amp; fauna 
        seeming marvelous to him, &amp; also in the chapter on Cortez, "The Destruction 
        Of Tenochtitlan", how the Montezuma empire -- which itself seems to me 
        unbearable -- was a proliferation of some <i>possibility</i> that greeted 
        the Europeans when they came to these shores . . . the idea that America 
        was an undiscovered new world . . . is still current for me, despite, 
        to me, the evident fact of utter destruction, disintegration, contamination, 
        pollution &amp; decay . . . so that's an interesting proposition, that 
        somehow 'the new world' remains to be discovered, &amp; it's most engagingly 
        &amp; in a dear way articulated, for me, in this old essay "The Poet" 
        by Ralph Waldo Emerson, in apparently, according to my old college text 
        -- I'm getting really sentimental &amp; dragging out these things -- Stephen 
        Whicher (<i>Selections from Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>, ed. Stephen Whicher 
        (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1960)) -- it must be in Gelpi's course that 
        I got this book, I don't know where else I would have found it -- it's 
        a nice book, it goes chronologically through his journal extracts to the 
        big statements about the American scholar, &amp; how the poet &amp; scholar 
        are one, &amp; that they're involved in investigation of the condition 
        of the world &amp; 'the new world' remains to be discovered . . . &amp; 
        the <i>prophetic</i> instigation that's in that essay, absolutely current, 
        to me, absolutely present . . . tinged by the 'left-brain' or 'right-brain' 
        recognition that <i>it's over</i>! -- so, I like that kind of absurd juxtaposition 
        of propositions -- now I want to do another little parenthetical &amp; 
        go back, as part of my Gelpi exposition, to the year 1961 . . . I went 
        to Harvard College as a scholarship student from Minnesota, on an 'athletic 
        scholarship' -- which didn't exist &amp; doesn't exist -- I was supposed 
        to be a great basketball player, only I'm only about that big (laughter), 
        I didn't make the team, it was <i>terrible</i> . . . furthermore, I didn't 
        know how to read, &amp; I took Humanities 6, which was Introduction To 
        Literature, &amp; this guy named Paul Alpers -- who ended up being at 
        Berkeley for many years -- <i>tried</i> to teach me to learn to read <i>The 
        Fairie Queen</i> &amp; to pick up the terminology &amp; jargon of the 
        New Criticism, which was like -- I can't remember it anymore, I finally 
        learned how to do it, &amp; all year I struggled between a C+ &amp; a 
        B-minus, finally got a B-minus through his good graces -- it's all about 
        how you 'prepare the reader for', set something up, &amp; criticism was 
        perceived in those days to be a 'science' &amp; wanted to be a science 
        &amp; I wasn't very 'scientific' -- my parents wanted me to be a doctor 
        &amp; so I took Introduction To Chemistry, &amp; had absolutely no scientific 
        . . . <i>ability</i> -- I managed to maintain my B-minus average, to keep 
        the scholarship, but I was really 'out of my element' -- I was a 'hick' 
        from wherever it was -- so I took a leave of absence in the spring of 
        1960, after my first year, carefully preparing the possibility of return, 
        &amp; explaining it all with some difficulty to my parents . . . I had 
        a year off &amp; I read <i>Ulysses</i> in San Francisco, &amp; of course 
        that was the time of <i>On The Road</i>, &amp; <i>The Dharma Bums</i> 
        &amp; <i>The Subterraneans</i>, so I went to San Francisco, not to rehearse 
        all of that -- so I came back, in the fall of 1961, to return to school, 
        &amp; instead of living in some building like this, they had these cooperative 
        housing establishments . . . up Mass. Ave. a little ways, like a 'house' 
        would be bought by the College &amp; then you could live together &amp; 
        everybody could wash dishes together &amp; it would be more 'homey' . 
        . . so I registered, in September 1961, to return to school, &amp; at 
        a certain point, when everything was going to proceed -- it was kind of 
        a hot day in September, rather a nice day -- instead of going<i> down</i> 
        Mass. Ave. to Harvard College, I went <i>up</i> Mass. Ave., <i>out</i> 
        Mass. Ave. . . . <i>anywhere</i>, to be <i>away</i> from that circumstance 
        . . . &amp; I walked a long way, it was quite hot, &amp; I must have been 
        in some 'difficulty' or 'exhuberance', I walked all the way on the <i>other</i> 
        side of Route 128 -- which at the time was 'the end of the known world', 
        meaning a kind of boundary &amp; circumstance -- I like to think of 'Buffalo' 
        in Charles Olson's mind as the 'West' (laughter) &amp; that people actually 
        crossed the Appalachians &amp; went way out there to Buffalo &amp; so 
        on, I didn't go that far (laughter) -- &amp; I was in a state of some<i> 
        travail</i>, &amp; so I got way out there somehow, &amp; I crossed Route 
        128 some place past a reservoir in Lincoln, or Concord, Mass., &amp; out 
        there . . . you got to the point where there were trees, &amp; there were 
        apple orchards &amp; a beautiful time of year -- apples must have been 
        treated heavily with chemicals &amp; so on -- but I was exhausted, in 
        some 'state', &amp; I 'fell asleep under an apple tree in Concord, Mass.' 
        . . . &amp; the image I'm proposing to you is that that was the beginning 
        of my life as a 'personage exploring the new world' . . . I wasn't a writer 
        then, I was just '<i>confused</i>' (laughs) . . . so I left college again, 
        &amp; then I had to go see a person in the Health Services about it (laughter), 
        &amp; they were very tolerant in that day &amp; age, so I took another 
        year off, &amp; through the instigation of various persons -- Roger Keyes 
        to Marie Rexroth to Marthe Rexroth to Robert Creeley to Ken Irby back 
        in Cambridge to Gordon Cairnie &amp; the Grolier Book Shop, Elsa Dorfman, 
        Robert Lowell, Albert Gelpi -- I sit before you today . . . <i>What could 
        'the new world' possibly mean, in a time of the destruction of all things</i>? 
        . . . &amp; is it a kind of indulgence, so to inquire, so to speak? . 
        . . I remember introducing Robert Creeley, when I was wet behind my ears 
        &amp; <i>nervous</i>, at the University of California at Berkeley in 1969 
        or thereabouts -- he was getting old even then! (laughter) -- so I was 
        trembling up at the platform &amp; so proud to have 'brought him to the 
        campus' &amp; all that, &amp; I said, "He's written blip-blip-blip &amp; 
        he's written blip-blip . . . <i>The Quick Graph</i>" . . . &amp; then 
        a voice over on the side said, "<i><b>A</b> Quick Graph</i>!" . . . so, 
        instead of trying to propose, for your consideration, 'The Task Of Poetry' 
        as Martin Heidegger might do -- "Wozu Dichter?", "What Are Poets For?" 
        -- I would elicit your help -- &amp; I'm sorry to have spoken this long 
        in this introductory fashion -- in articulation that I've never done, 
        about a certain kind of funny little thingamajig, which is <i>a task</i> 
        of poetry perhaps, that has to do with finding out about what 'the new 
        world' might be . . &amp; let me just read, since I was reading this Lawrence 
        &amp; Williams again, for old times' sake . . . I read a part that I'd 
        never read before, in this <i>Studies In Classic American Literature</i>, 
        about Cooper's Leatherstocking novels . . . apparently, from England, 
        Lawrence as he acknowledges was in love with the business of going <i>from</i> 
        England, in that day &amp; age (1922 or . .) -- this book was written, 
        partially somewhere &amp; partially in New Mexico, finished in New Mexico, 
        it's a wonderful book, <i>much better than</i> <i>In The American Grain</i>, 
        as <i>writing</i>, in fact -- he talks about his own youthful enthusiasm 
        for the idea of going into the wilderness, &amp; then he completely destroys 
        Cooper as a kind of person with French pretensions, who, if you know this 
        book, liked to be the person who -- sort of like, what was that 'Indian', 
        Buffalo Bill's Indian troupe that went around in England? Is that right, 
        Buffalo Bill, was it? . . . and they were hits! &amp; so Cooper, he was 
        a hit in Europe, but he really wanted to be a fashionable man of letters 
        in Paris, &amp; so he, according to Lawrence, he wrote about the wilderness 
        from Paris, by design &amp; with some success</font></p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passionate love for America, 
          for the soil of America, for example. As I say, it is perhaps easier

          often, than when you are right there. When you are actually <i>in</i>

        I don't think the factories will fall down right away . . . <i>maybe they 
        will</i> -- so, as a way of trying to give an account of whatever it is 
        I've come to be up to, I want to do a commentary, in the nine or ten minutes 
        remaining, on this essay, "The Poet" of Ralph Waldo Emerson's, which I 
        asked at a very late date that Charles (Bernstein) assign to you, or at 
        least recommend to you as a text for your consideration, and see whether, 
        from that, there might be something to be done -- actually, before doing 
        that, having done this rather extensive introduction, I want to take a 
        short break &amp; go to the bathroom &amp; then reorganize, because I 
        want to do this through . . . thinking &amp; speaking to whatever it is 
        you may have in mind.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Well, it's 
        kinda hot in here, but I guess we better get going, Charles is very . 
        . .helpful in this way of moving things along, relative to a certain established 
        measure . . Emerson begins by bemoaning the fact that, in that day &amp; 
        age -- which makes perfect sense -- American literature was subservient 
        to European models, &amp; that, as noted in the Whicher book, in some 
        of the journal entries -- William Cullen Bryant, for example -- what exists 
        as American literature isn't as good as what is being made in England 
        &amp; on the Continent at that time, &amp; Emerson proposes it's about 
        time Americans got down to business . . . now, I would like to disentangle 
        myself from that -- is that a 'jingoistic' proposition? -- that it's an 
        'American' literature that this is all about . . . it's about ' the new 
        world', wherever it may be found . . . so, I too think that, since I'm 
        an American &amp; only been to Europe once, it's hard enough to try to 
        establish a ground in these States, but I would substitute something like 
        Williams' phrase, "the local", for the base toward, for which, in response 
        to which one would hope to be adequate &amp; articulate . . . curiously, 
        whatever it is in the twenties, however seventy, eighty, seventy years 
        later, both Lawrence &amp; Williams in effect say the same thing, despite 
        the famous example of Whitman who -- &amp; I don't know the fact of that, 
        perhaps someone does --<i> it's time for an interruption</i>! -- to what 
        extent was Whitman actually directly influenced by the prophetic &amp; 
        inspirational call in this essay, "The Poet" . . . &amp; enabled to leave 
        his job as a journalist, in part, &amp; undertake the task of his work, 
        which he published initially in what, 1855 -- so what is the gap there, 
        twelve or thirteen years -- does anybody <i>know</i> that?</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: When did

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">AN: Yes, but 
        he also praised Emerson at the end of his life, he says that it was precisely

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">AN: It was

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">AN: But that's 
        very strange, to think of Emerson as just really silent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: He was 
        in his dotage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">AN: Exactly, 
        he's just a face . . . but Whitman's very ambivalent about it, I think 
        some of the influence is there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Well, part 
        of the instruction in the essay, "The Poet" is <i>exactly</i> what Whitman 
        did, in fact . . his catalogues of the different conditions of American 
        experience . . . so, despite that moving &amp; -- &amp; that's another 
        parenthetical which I will not introduce entirely -- wonderful time several 
        years ago reading the whole 'deathbed' <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> <i>aloud</i>, 
        over a period of a whole year, with a group of friends in Bolinas, what 
        a <i>great</i> thing to have done, &amp; so I was able to have some direct 
        relation, late in life, to Whitman which I had avoided somehow because 
        of the bluster &amp; 'effusion' -- but anyway, in the twenties, the same 
        proposition is made . . . from 'abroad', in effect . . . by Lawrence who 
        aspired to, what would you call it, the 'real world', the 'primitive' 
        . . . interested also in Melville's South Sea islands books, <i>Typee</i>, 
        <i>Omoo</i> &amp; how Melville rejected that -- his leg swelled up &amp; 
        he had to get back to civilization . . . so going '<i>back</i>' to the 
        'primitive' was not 'the new world' -- but the question is basically, 
        for me, <i>if</i> that's a concern -- &amp; it is, for me -- how it can 
        be brought about . . . well, you can reject your British father . . . 
        you can talk about how great Bill Clinton is (laughter) . . you can celebrate

        chose to come here now, I like the idea of the change of the season -- 
        well, I'll pursue that -- Halloween is the gap between the worlds, like 
        twilight in the cycle of the year . . . it might allow something to be 
        shaken out of the 'fix' that's grown over, the Sherwin-Williams paint 
        covering the world thing (laughter) -- you guys probably don't know . 
        . . is that brand still extant? </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: It used

        is, still on the can.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: All right! 
        So, there might be a little crack in that paint, that's the idea, when 
        the spirits come back, come out of the ground -- in Lawrence's sense, 
        the unappeased demons will return to devour the Americans -- but <i>maybe</i> 
        something else might appear, there might be something else there to be 
        done . . . since the supposed title of this supposed talk is "Realizing 
        Things", I should let the cat out of the bag &amp; think that somehow 
        that could possibly be done, &amp; I realized after the fact that this 
        was a phrase taken from Larry Eigner, on a number of occasions, &amp; 
        so . . . the task, for me, has been to try to find some way in which 'letters', 
        meaning 'literature', could be the equal -- at least the equal, &amp; 
        possibly the agency &amp; apparition -- of what is, in writing, such that 
        'the new world' might come to appear, for a 'moment' . . . again, in the 
        context of thinking of the world disappearing at an incredibly rapid rate, 
        around us, not only in one's lifetime but over <i>any</i> stated period 
        of things, the Romantic emphasis on the 'moment' as something to be realized 
        &amp; achieved is given a certain exaggerated poignancy . . . any time 
        that anybody could be alive, in <i>any</i> sense, by getting up in the 
        morning or going to sleep, could in fact possibly be 'the new world', 
        properly perceived &amp; recognized . . . so, but there's a methodology 
        involving realization of things in the work of Larry Eigner which I don't 
        really want to speak of in detail today, but I will read just an exemplary 
        passage -- &amp; it's a relief to find the understated kind of way something 
        is said in this book, which goes right past you at first, it doesn't seem 
        to have any great urgency as statement -- so this piece, called "not / 
        forever / serious" from <i>areas / lights / heights</i> I will read the 
        first part of, anyway . . . so, how can 'the new world', whatever that 
        is -- &amp; is it a <i>totally</i> illusory concept? . . . it doesn't 
        mean, anymore, the area which has not been trompled down . . . is it just 
        a habit of some kind, a belief in . . . life after death, projected onto 
        the plane of existence? . . . is it even preposterous to propose that 
        there might be a "beginning &amp; beginning again"? -- which is what Gertrude 
        Stein uses for her own way of proceeding, "beginning &amp; beginning again" 
        -- is it just a 'hang-up' on something? . . . &amp; we ought to </font></p>

        achieved, can one speak of the idea of the realization of 'the new world' 
        in terms of metaphors of approaching 'one step nearer to' these things? 
        . . . all this stuff is impossible to speak, in fact, &amp; the delightful 
        thing about Emerson is, he just goes on with it -- &amp; of course he 
        made a whole industry out of it, with the lyceum, lyceums, he travelled 
        around, like Robert Bly or Joseph Campbell, he really got people feeling 
        good (laughter) . . . either that, I mean some people, that was the idea 
        . . . as an 'orator', there's a metaphor of "the orator, at the door of 
        the assembly" in this, about the . . . possibility of approaching the 
        condition of saying something, which is really delightful &amp; moving, 
        but that which is said is, in many cases . . . you look at it, it may 
        not get you any 'closer to' whatever it is . . . so, there's a <i>gap</i> 
        between words &amp; things which cannot be resolved, fortunately, by any 
        idea of 'drawing nearer' . . &amp; yet , somehow -- let's just think of 
        what other things occur to you, that was one, that we might speak to . 
        . . I like to take these little pebbles -- oh, he says, in a letter to 
        Carlyle which is in here (Whicher), that his work is inchoate in some 
        way, it's like pebbles that are irreducible, &amp; he juxtaposes them 
        with each other (Letter to Thomas Carlyle, May 10, 1838: "Here I sit and 
        read and write, with very little system, and, as far as regards composition, 
        with the most fragmentary result: paragraphs incomprehensible, each sentence 
        an infinitely repellent particle." -- Whicher, p. 124) -- how is it that 
        you're going to be able to bring about anything at all . . . which 'hasn't 
        been said' or is there to be found &amp; undertaken? . . . because there 
        has to be this instigation of some kind, the idea that you're drawn toward 
        something, you see something &amp; you're <i>amazed</i> by it . . . you're 
        amazed by the realization of the world, through the world, by itself, 
        <i>all the time</i>, in existence . . . &amp; how can the human -- <i>worms 
        that we are, &amp; devastators of existence</i>! -- in this time, before 
        the end of things, come to acknowledge the . . . 'the new world' that 
        is around us at all times? I mean, it's a . . schmaltzy enough proposition.</font></p>

        of course it isn't 'America' at all, 'America' is a <i>metaphor</i>! .

        for a writer -- &amp; I want to redirect the consideration more particularly 
        toward the matter of which we are supposedly the . . . something-or-others 
        -- writing involves unsettling the conventions that one has learned in 
        order to be able to speak at all, or communicate, &amp; particularly to, 
        in some way or other, 'destroy' the achievement of those whose works have 
        come immediately before -- by 'destroy' one means 'pay hommage to' -- 
        by acknowledging the limitation, &amp; somehow finding a way of stepping 
        -- I'm going to use that again, it's hard to avoid that -- stepping aside 
        from what's been done in a particular structure of verse . . . in order 
        to be able to work at all, as a writer, you have to study what's been 
        done as a verbal structure, in some way or other, &amp; learn what the 
        medium entails -- thus, 'life drawing' for a -- &amp; for a writer, for 
        me in the time I was growing up, it was the idea that was especially articulated 
        by William Carlos Williams that the speech . . . if you pay attention 
        to American speech, you can in some way or other extract from the 'local' 
        an element of the terrain, in a sense, which is also a structural possibility 
        in language as a medium . . . thereby, if you use the -- 'out of the mouths 
        of Polish mothers' -- if you write that, then your work will partake of 
        the eternal recurrence of the same, insofar as one inhabits a particular 
        time &amp; place &amp; <i>that's how they talk</i> . . . so if you <i>write</i> 
        that way, then you are somehow possibly approaching the 'real', the dogmatic 
        condition of experience which is 'the new world' for that time . . . but 
        as soon as that possibility has been developed, articulated &amp; encoded 
        as an available convention of procedure, as such it becomes an obstacle 
        to the discovery of 'the new world' . . . &amp; at that point, it's essential 
        for a <i>writer</i> -- &amp; that's what we're talking about now, I'm 
        not talking about myself anymore when I was 20 years old &amp; I was walking 
        around &amp; I was enthused about the possibility of recognizing that 
        a tree was not a particular tree only, but it was a '<i>that</i>' . . 
        . &amp; the question that Martin Heidegger, among others, proposed . . 
        that something<i> is</i>, rather than nothing . . . can be one of the 
        means of access to the development of the -- let's use the word 'spiritual' 
        -- change that's necessary for a re-cognition of what's happening . . 
        . after you've done that, you haven't done much (laughter), you've got 
        to get into a . . . means of proceeding . . . 'form', a body of procedure 
        that allows you to <i>exist</i> . . . so, you can't just walk around, 
        as I was doing, quite contentedly bumping into 'thats' &amp; being very 
        content with the fact that 'that' was, 'that' is, &amp; telling everybody 
        about it -- if you're a <i>writer</i>, you need to find some way of inhabiting

        America, with the objective of finding America . . . as a field of writing 
        containing these images of decay, disaggregation, distraction, short span 
        of attention . . so that sentences is all we are left with . . . I thought 
        it was very interesting, &amp; I was hoping to see how then you would 
        jump into Emerson, because -- &amp; here I want to go back to what Graham 
        Foust mentioned a bit earlier -- if Emerson advocates, or seems to advocate, 
        a poetics of uncertainties (GF said, "only insofar as we are unsettled 
        is there any hope for us"), on the other hand Emerson encourages us to 
        settle into some higher plane of experience where everything is perfect 
        &amp; unified. This is clearly argued in his essay "Nature", in the subsection 
        titled "Idealism" . . . the call for a poetics of "unsettled" intellectuals

        the trouble with Emerson, in fact . . . can't deal with it.</font></p>

        in decay, disaggregation . . . that seems to me the only way one can really 
        'find America', right? . . . as a "meter-making argument", just the sheer 
        conceptual object -- because of the many ideologic . . . many, many layers 
        of ideological, political conflicts . . . &amp; racial conflicts upon 
        which this country was founded -- this object in itself is profoundly 
        disaggregating.</font></p>

        only the isolated sentence . . . it's gone through a process that I want 
        to speak to, in part, into words, &amp; then into <i>letters</i> . . . 
        so, from one perspective, total 'fragmentation' . . . &amp; yet that has 
        allowed me to proceed -- let's look at some of the Emerson &amp; I can 
        try to comment on it, about these problems of idealism &amp; 'higher'</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: If you're

        Platonism.</font></p>

        thought <i>is</i> the spirit . . . &amp; is what unifies everything (RG 
        sighs), words are on a secondary level, words disaggregate but the thought, 
        &amp; the spirit that animates the thought, unifies these mistakes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: And the 
        moral emphasis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: But on 
        the higher level . . . you also find a conception of the 'real', what 
        is 'reality', he never </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Well, that's 
        the problem, coming out of Puritan theology &amp; Platonism, that the 
        'best' is reserved for the 'higher' level . . . &amp; I don't have any 
        experience of the hierarchy of 'better' or 'worse' -- well, I won't say 
        that, but certainly of 'higher' or 'lower' -- conditions . . . so, you 
        have to constantly quarrel with it -- like anything -- for it to make 
        sense . . . but let's try just to read a few passages &amp; see how far 
        we get with it . . . we could start with the paragraph beginning</font></p>

        there's a jump between the poet &amp; philosopher but they're conjoined, 
        conjunct undertakings, despite their difference . . . it could just be

        &amp; energy of the writing itself into a structuring of what's going

        think the idea of mimesis -- which is, you know, the traditional way, 
        in which one holds . . . &amp; Emerson actually uses that, holding up 
        a mirror to nature, in this essay somewhere -- is, in fact, not what it's

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Yeah, but 
        that isn't what language does . . . I think words are, once you recognize 
        that words are a self-contained system, with their own codes of operation 
        &amp; so on, you cannot confuse them with something which is not 'words' 
        . . . so, to me, it's nonsense that one could think of words as a mirror 
        of -- it's an apples &amp; oranges problem -- nonetheless, there is the 
        possibility that one can inhabit a verbal structure closely enough, such 
        that you can bring your recognition of stuff that's going on in words 
        to bear upon phenomena elsewise . . . therefore, you can participate in 
        the invention of nature by, as Gertrude Stein says in her account of her 
        procedure in <i>Tender Buttons</i>, creating a new name which, in some 
        sense, has something to do with that of which it speaks . . . so that 
        you are not simply making a verbal object for its own sake, but you're 
        participating in the invention of nature . . . &amp; not only the words 
        as new things, but the metamorphosis that you're inhabiting in the language 
        process is 'conjunct' with other 'stuff' . . . &amp; that's the . . . 
        if you get into that condition of writing, then, in my experience, that's 
        a possible answer to the question, how is it that 'the new world' can 
        be found or acknowledged in some way.</font></p>

        -- a category that doesn't exist in Native American languages because 
        the whole world is 'culture' to them, you could say (RG: yeah) -- then

        in order to be able to begin to do this, it was necessary for me to make 
        an utter distinction between language phenomena &amp; that of which words 
        speak, whatever it is they say . . . had I not done so -- &amp; I don't 
        know that that's not the case for anybody writing, that is, you have to 
        see what the conventions of utterance for the time are, &amp; you have 
        to learn to<i> do</i> it somehow, or at least be able to recognize how 
        it could be done, by Robert Frost or somebody in the immediate or distant 
        tradition, &amp; then you locate in relation to the words as words themselves, 
        &amp; in fact you find, I found at some point in the time of the composition 
        of this group of things, <i>Sentences</i> -- Charles picked out yesterday 
        one that said, "searchlight distributes sky light it administers", that's 
        just one line -- that was made probably by free association, not by looking 
        at searchlights playing around the sky, but taking the word 'searchlight' 
        &amp; riding with it . . . what is the</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">&#9;. . . 
          for in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">-- riding on 
        the verbal energy until something was said . . . &amp; so, at that time, 
        I no longer tried to 'express my love for Mardou', or whoever was the 
        heroine of<i> The Subterraneans</i> in New York, not in North Beach, but 
        just a fascination with the way words seem to create what's happening 
        out of 'whole cloth', out of the nexus of the verbal structural elements, 
        &amp; if you get to that strange condition of dislocation -- which you 
        have adequately criticized -- curiously, &amp; for me that's involved, 
        quickly further, it came through thinking Zukofsky's way of weighing words 
        themselves in the late "A", he counts words . . . so instead of having 
        an iambic pentameter line with five feet, he has five words, eventually, 
        although earlier there're two words, three words, in "A-22", "A-23", there's 
        a five-word line with a syllabic range from five to seventeen . . . &amp; 
        if you realize that <i>that's</i> what it's 'about', &amp; you see the 
        way the world is being generated by thinking through these forms, then 
        you can inhabit the form in such a way that you can then 'return to the 
        world', &amp; have a prayer of "thinking with the things as they exist",

        . . . Zukofsky certainly does that, for one thing, &amp; Charles Bernstein 
        does that very . . . by incorporating kinds of diction which are not 'poetic' 
        into the poem . . . Zukofsky's polysyllabism is one of the delights, for 
        me, in the late "<i>A</i>" -- but anyway, in my 'development', there was 
        the speech-based line, then there was this meter of Zukofsky's which is 
        based upon counting words, &amp; that somehow allowed me to recognize 
        the presence of letters in words, &amp; speaking yesterday about the function 
        of the typewriter &amp; the equalization . . in the Selectric typewriter 
        methodology, each letter is given an equivalent width -- the i's are the 
        same width as the m's, the l's are the same width as the w's -- &amp; 
        I was able to count each letter as 'one' . . . &amp; so that would be 
        a further 'removal', I suppose, &amp; reengagement with the language process 
        only . . . &amp; then I got to the point where I could think the combination 
        of letters back into words, &amp; make words out of letters on the typewriter, 
        &amp; that would allow things to begin to appear to exist . . . &amp; 
        then, subsequent to that, there was the getting-off the typewriter &amp; 
        beginning to write letters by hand, to draw them into existence . . . 
        &amp; then that procedure, which is ongoing -- this is a very short account 
        . . . &amp; the 'idea' is, if you focus sufficiently on the materials 
        of language itself, possibly you'll be able to bring back to the participation 
        in &amp; with things a means of actualizing what's happening . . . everybody 
        has to invent for themselves a means of proceding, so that they can, if 
        they're interested, undertake this task of realizing things . . . &amp; 
        it's going to be different, by definition, for writers who have different 
        operations . . . but, paradoxically enough, the farther you get into the 
        structure of language itself, I've found, the more are you enabled at 
        times to be able to go into the metamorphosis, the flow through things 
        that Emerson speaks of, &amp; have a prayer of . . . of saying something, 
        as it seems to be for that time . . . &amp; that's a great joy &amp; affirmation

        Could you talk a little more about the jump from typed poems to handwritten 
        poems (RG: um hmm), like why the jump, or what was your thought process 
        at that point?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Well, it 
        was what was lying around in the shop, where I worked as a proofreader, 
        there were these Uniball pens in four colors &amp; I was accustomed to 
        using them while proofreading to try to clarify a complicated correction 
        . . . &amp; then, I don't know that I can give any idea of how that came 
        about, beyond that . . . I started to use a couple of colors -- first 
        I started to write . . . in this book, <i>Phantom Anthems</i> (shows book) 
        there's a couple of pieces that . . well, this is offset from, this is 
        obsessively offset from typescript masters, &amp; that I thought was a 
        form at that time, but in there is a funny, partially handwritten poem 
        about my aunt Ragnhild Bjeldanes -- wherever that is, oh there it is, 
        it's in the middle somewhere -- "MAY DAWN HORIZON MANY GRACES POLLEN", 
        &amp; this has these annotations on it that somehow became part of the 
        typescript process, &amp; there was some recognition that it was necessary 
        to offset <i>all</i> that, not the 'final result' typed up &amp; varied 
        but the whole way it was written, &amp; so out of that came further instances 
        in here (holds up black box, <i>What I Believe</i> etc.) &amp; I got off 
        the Selectric &amp; went back to my highschool typewriter which made a 
        darker image, with a dark ribbon -- this was a manual -- &amp; that image 
        somehow. . . huh! Delusion! . . . I thought that was more, somehow, 'that 
        of which it spoke' than the Selectric image . . . it was darker, denser 
        . . . one of 'em goes, "third can of minestrone in as many nights" (laughter) 
        . . . &amp; there was some feeling that had a greater, hands-on tenacity 
        or 'facticity' -- what does that mean? -- it was 'thick', like, I wanted 
        it to be 'thick' . . . &amp; so, then in this black box there were, for 
        example, other things that begin to be hand-written . . . four poems that 
        say only "my heart is beating", underneath that is written "I am a beast", 
        these are written right on top of each other in the originals, &amp; it's 
        really off the typewriter &amp; it's sideways . . . although if you compare 
        it to the works in <i>Sentences</i>, it's exactly the same, in some ways, 
        it's on the same size (proportion) paper . . . &amp; then if you hold 
        all four up to the light (walks to window), you can see an even 'thicker' 
        extension of that . . &amp; that's no more than some kind of a graph of 
        the heart beating, basically, as it might be indicated on some kind of 
        a machine -- it was something about it becoming 'one step closer to things', 
        &amp; I question that entire proposition, <i>because</i> it was achieving 
        a more 'thing-like' fact in itself . . . &amp; it did that by becoming 
        more insistently language, structure, it did that by becoming more of 
        &amp; part of the materials of language <i>exclusively</i> . . . instead 
        of writing "my heart is beating", you had to make the heart beat in words, 
        in the materials of words, in order to have a hope of engaging the condition 
        of which you speak &amp; toward which words move . . . so that's a paradox 
        which remains, to this day, active to me -- &amp; then the colors began 
        to come in, &amp; that's a complicated long discussion, &amp; they were 
        like four voices &amp; they could be in a simultaneity, like a chord in 
        music, in visual space, &amp; the fact that they had that kind of, well, 
        'integrity' or structural insistence also was beginning to move 'closer' 
        to the fact of . . the one, say, that says, for example, "fish / hawk 
        / with / fish" . . is a purely verbal invention but, as such, I experienced 
        it as part &amp; parcel of the actual bird bringing the actual fish to 
        my eyes . . . so, in order to approach 'the new world', you have to invent 
        it . . . but the result of the 'invention' is only what it was, what it 
        is . . . only what it is, in a way that doesn't need the writing at all, 
        to be what it is, so . . . there must be other ways of doing this, &amp; 
        yet it's been interesting for me, re-reading the Emerson, to see -- &amp; 
        thinking about Al Gelpi's course, The Poet In America, &amp; re-reading 
        the <i>Studies In Classic American Literature</i> &amp; <i>In The American 
        Grain </i>-- to see, for myself, how much of what I've done has been a 
        natural development of the American poetic tradition that I 'inhabit', 
        in a funny sort of way . . . at the <i>very</i> time that I'm 'completely 
        out of it', &amp; have no idea how I'm going to survive, or make a basis 
        for this developing new relationship which is so . . important . . . &amp; 
        there's very little, say, I mean somebody will see my stuff &amp; they'll 
        say, "<i>What's that</i>?" . . . you know, like . . . &amp; this is, like, 
        "What <i>is</i> it?" . . . but to me, it's a <i>partial</i> fulfillment 
        of a possibility that's articulated 'way back then', which isn't all that 
        long ago, but given the speed of transformation of cultural possibilities, 
        it's . . . for many people, Emerson would not even be a subject of consideration, 
        a matter -- for example, in my immediate predecessors, Creeley &amp; Olson 
        &amp; Williams &amp; Pound, to my knowledge, there's no mention of Emerson 
        -- is that true? -- at least there's no significant recognition, as there 
        is of much other material, like Whitman.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Chris Alexander: 
        Pound has a little bit about Emerson, here &amp; there, but very small.</font></p>

        moralism going on all the time in Emerson, a kind of way of . . . he thought 
        of himself as somebody who was trying to help people realize their lives, 
        &amp; so he was cajoling persons to move &amp; to feel ok that day . . 
        . &amp; so there is a kind of super-fluous pomposity in <i>much</i> of

        the condition of the times &amp; part the invention of a . . . I mean,

        of the mind &amp; the energies of the writer can be brought to bear upon 
        the poem as a 'site', which is a meeting ground between -- again, thinking

        think you're going to save the world by coming up with a new language 
        which will -- &amp; that's another -- create a heaven on earth, in this 
        time . . . but you do get these moments of . . . realization, &amp; as 
        Larry Eigner says, you don't want to make too much of them . . you are 
        content with what can be accomplished, &amp; you can stop any time . . 
        if <i>something</i> has been made, or found . . . so the 'discovery' of 
        'the new world' is very much part of it, too, but in these days that certainly 
        incorporates a deteriorating circumstance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Tim Shaner: 
        The fact that those poems that are moving toward 'the new world' come 
        out of the shop . . (RG: yeah!), the belly of the beast or</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: You mean 
        the workshop of the poet?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">TS: the law 
        firm that you worked at</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Oh,<i> 
        that</i> shop!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">TS: was kinda 
        interesting to me.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: I liked 
        it at the time, I thought I was getting back at it (TS: right), I was 
        using it against itself, &amp; to some extent I took a certain satisfaction 
        from that -- but that doesn't mean anything to <i>you</i>, as a reader, 
        who sees the object . . . that's just the instigation, it's part of the 
        writer's motivation, there has to be something that bugs you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">TS: But I see 
        that motivation in some of <i>Phantom Anthems</i>, where</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Oh that's 
        a <i>rant</i>, has rants against capitalism . . . I don't think that's 
        of any use (laughter) . . . I do think that, given the limited amount 
        of time there seems to be, it's better to attempt to realize what's of 
        interest to oneself -- if there were the possibility of changing the world 
        then, as Larry Eigner said to Charles Olson, why doesn't he run for Congress? 
        . . . &amp; do something useful . . for my sake, it's now really an almost 
        nostalgic proposition of using the human, insofar as one is alive, to 
        acknowledge what may have been the world . . . as it could have been known 
        . . . so there's a certain kind of past tense about everything that exists 
        in the present moment -- could we stop?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Carla Billitteri: 
        Isn't there a kind of contradiction in saying that you're interested in 
        this idea of 'America', in 'finding America', 'America' . . . ?, but then, 
        of course, you pull up Emerson to read at the moment . . . anybody just 
        cites Emerson, that person has already 'found America', there's no need 
        to look any farther than that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Why, why?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: &amp; even 
        your ideology of nature in writing is a way of 'finding America', &amp; 
        it's already 'found' in Emerson, founded in Emerson . . . it's a final, 
        deadly perhaps, contradiction.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: 'Deadly'! 
        The contradiction would be . . . 'the new world' was already</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: It's self-defeating 
        to articulate a new poetics based upon </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: State the 
        opposition as you perceive it, the contradiction.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: It's . 
        . . it's a question that has already been answered, in many ways . . the 
        fact that he already -- not only that this question of 'finding America' 
        -- what is 'America'?, can we 'find America'? -- has already been answered, 
        but it has been answered in quite a final manner by Emerson </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: How has 
        it been</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: by defining 
        'America' as this place for a poetics of nature . . . &amp; the poem centered 
        around naming, here &amp; there, etcetera, etcetera, &amp; by your very 
        referral to Emerson, you're not only answering an answer that has already 
        been answered exactly just in the same way, but you're also defeating 
        your intentions of 'finding' something altogether.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Why is 
        it a defeat?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: Because 
        you're just back into the trenches of 'finding nature', answering to 'nature' 
        to articulate this state of 'nature' . . . (RG: yeah), just Romantic</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: So that's 
        not 'the new world', all I'm doing is rehashing the 'old', in effect, 
        even though I propose it as</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: Over &amp; 
        over &amp; over again!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: Yeah . 
        . . I find that . . . I think you're right.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: There are 
        very many new, interesting things in your writing . . . that have not 
        altogether, ever been articulated in Emersonian terms or </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: I hope 
        so! Great!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: which can 
        be thought in terms of anti-mimetic . . . or can be thought in many different 
        ways.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: I hope 
        so! . . on the other hand, I must say, just experientially, the last two 
        times I read this whole statement, it brought tears to my eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">CB: It has 
        such a great rhetorical impact, right?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">RG: No, the 
        tears . . . it was, like, <i>recognition</i> . . . this is said, &amp; 
        I can acknowledge this to be how I understand what I do, in ways that<i> 
        I</i> experience as, in fact, opening new possibilities -- see, it's a 
        question of procedure, because you have to invent a structural way of 
        acknowledging or saluting the so-called 'new world' . . . you're never 
        in a condition of repeating an 'idea', you're in the condition of attempting 
        to actualize what's said . . . &amp; in order to do that, you have to 
        participate in the invention of the world, &amp; that requires something 
        'further', even though the 'idea' . . . is stated adequately in this text 
        -- but even if you think that you share something . . . with the recognition 
        of the task, you haven't begun to do anything <i>that day</i> . . . you 
        go home &amp; get to work, which I will do after some period of recovery 
        . . . <i>thank you</i>! (laughter, applause) </font></p>
