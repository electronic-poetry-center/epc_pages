<P>
To listen to this work is to hear not just the sea
at the end of<B> </B>the beach but the ocean in the midst of our
words.</FONT>

<P>
I would read this book anywhere--even at the beach!

Wit <i>ne plus ultra</I>--like,
&quot;To see the world in a grain of sand . . . ,&quot; and likewise
to hear it.  Far out!

--very much enjoyed, <i>enjoying </i>. . .the big BEACH OF
THE DAY . . . Does allow for all sorts of entrances &amp; exits &amp;
browsings . . . &amp; the always welcome sense of humor throughout .
 . . form worked by the tide &amp; shore, ever&#173;changing, but,
<i>a place, zone, </i> its specific form, items of the littoral of presence
&amp; attention . . . to which I return &amp; return . . . the spirit
revives &amp; expands there, sustained &amp; refreshed--

In the past two decades, Robert Grenier's work has
advanced word&#173;art in a joyous, pacific and irresistible way:
his words are inscribed on visible (<i>and &#173;</I> invisible, i.e.,
interior) prayer&#173;flags that flutter above and around the habitations
of many surviving anarchically intelligent humans in this hemisphere
(and, I guess, the other one, too). Come from the wind/breath,
gone into the wind/breath, returning and emanating, in great precision,
playfulness, and delighted integrity. The <i>intelligence of joy,</I>
once again manifest in our poetry.

Dear Bob,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I did enjoy A DAY AT THE BEACH--thanks a lot for thinking
to send it: it arrived last week, but I've been sick and without
the energy to write sooner; sorry. Thanks for OFF THE BRIM, too.
I flipped the book open on the bed (the post comes early here)
at 'territorial prison for the reverend moon'  and got an immediate
snort . . .

<P>
Visual or photo . . . realism of the head, maybe for
instance Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>  comparatively speaking too too much of
a continuum and solid (hard?) color, this Daily or Day Sequence
a tone row of just about split&#173;second i. e. immediately reflected
and realized (winkling flash of an eye) moments in and beyond
the mind, rooted in expletive(s), poetry (of earth in a way forever
and never dying or dead), &quot;earth's human shores&quot; or
what have you risen from that (sea) and set on pairs of contiguous
or together enough facing pages, spreads, areas. Quadri&#173;partate.
Variables (nothing too steadfast). Knowledge on Earth . . .
