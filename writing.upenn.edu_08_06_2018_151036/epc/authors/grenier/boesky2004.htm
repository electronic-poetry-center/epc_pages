      <P class=eleven style="COLOR: #666666">Marianne Boesky Gallery is pleased 
      to make available a number of 'old' (2003) and 'new' (2004) Giclée prints 
      by the poet-artist Robert Grenier.<BR><BR>Grenier is a 63-year-old, 
      wiry/paunchy, white-haired, disaffected, formerly influential, 
      prototypical/clean-shaven/Harvard-educated 'Language Writer' (from 
      Minnesota) become wildly innovative, 'neo-Romantic'/'old-fashioned', 
      hand-craft-writing/image-making, scruffy, corn, beans and 
      squash-growing/blackberry-apple jam-making/set-in-his-ways type of 
      opinionated, 'archaic'-nuthead/vociferously 'correct', 
      'liberal'/verbal/'extemporaneous' person living in Bolinas, CA. 
      <BR><BR>For the past 14 years, he has written exclusively by hand in blank 
      black notebooks, in four-colored ink. He has filled about 170 such 
      notebooks with his funny-looking drawing poems, which foreground the 
      'challenging' graphic characteristics of Grenier's 
      communicating/overlapping and tangling letter shapes, which (if one has 
      time &amp; makes room for an odd/ordinary kind of spatial comprehension) 
      may provide the reader/looker-on with a seemingly impossible/doubtless 
      'illusory', 'direct'-if-provisional engagement between the physical act of 
      verbal composition and the actual thing drawn/'said'. (This claim is not 
      unakin to that formerly fluently provided for certain patent medicines, 
      &amp; very possibly ought not to be swallowed.) It is true that each poem 
      is a singular and 'colorful' verbal and visual arrangement, not 
      reproducible by typographic means.<BR><BR>Some of them are quite 
      'beautiful'. Others serve whatever 'function'; they 'say'. Our favorites 
      'combine' beauty with function and participate in what they make 
      happen/write--e.g., the character of a March, 2004 day. <BR><BR>There is a 
      peculiar 'governing attention' given to number and balance of graphic 
      elements/'things' in their literal relations become 
      'literary-second-nature' throughout, recalling and differently confirming 
      William Carlos Williams' sense that the poet 'thinks with the poem' (here, 
      the letter shapes of these images, making words). For the artist-poet, the 
      works' primary interest remains firmly in the realm of Literature (echoing 
      the book page, in time), but the complexity and fascinating/irritating 
      graphic qualities of the recent poems (in space) make them maddening and 
      dazzling sites of 'literary'/'visual' exploration.<BR><BR>[Normally, each 
      line is underlined in the ink with which it is written; each (letter &amp; 
      line/word) is 'based' on the 'value' of the drawn letter (in relation to 
      the other letters)--i.e., its SHAPE!]<BR><BR>Grenier has selected and 
      organized pages from his recent drawing/writing notebooks and produced a 
      developing group of four-color drawing poems as signed, limited edition 
      Giclée prints on Hahnemühle Digital FineArt papers, sold individually and 
      as organized sets, as follows:<BR><BR>Three Poems/November 2002<BR>15 ¼ x

      inches/Hahnemühle 308 gsm Photo Rag<BR>$350 (edition of 
      20)<BR><BR>Produced on an Epson Stylus Pro 9500 printer at 1440/720 dpi 
      with six, pigment-based, archival inks, these Giclée prints (properly 
      framed and conserved) have a 'projected life' of at least 100 
      years.<BR><BR>Three further suites of Four Poems--May, June and July 
      2004--are in the works (toward 'completion' of a year of RG's life in the 
      'Agricultural Year' 2004).<BR><BR>Robert Grenier, who has received two NEA 
      fellowships for poetry writing, has presented his drawn poems extensively 
      in readings and slide presentations at many colleges and 
      universities/sites, including Woodland Pattern Book Center (Milwaukee, 
      WI), Stanford University (where his Archives are housed), The University 
      of Maine (Orono)(where he particularly enjoyed reading/discussing his 
      'stuff'), SUNY/Buffalo (There Too!), SUNY Albany (certainly!), California 
      College of Arts &amp; Crafts, U.C Berkeley (where he taught Contemporary 
      American Poetry &amp; Advanced Poetry Writing in the English Dept. in 
      1969/before he had written a thing!), Brown University (where he was 
      treated like a king in 2000!), Mills College (where he taught All his 
      'understanding of Poetry' in his shirtsleeves in 2002-2003), and in his 
      living room (for an otherwise-preoccupied/barely attending group of 
      friends!) oftentimes, over a period of years, etc.<BR><BR>Prints and 
      unique drawn poems have been exhibited at Marianne Boesky Gallery, both in 
      the exhibition Poetry Plastique (2001) and in conjunction with a reading 
      event hosted at the gallery in 2003.<BR><BR>Robert Grenier will show 
      Slides of These Very Same Drawing Poems (in different real-world/hand's-on 
      imaging)(Fujichrome Sensia 100, with fingers) in a reading/showing with 
      lifelong friend Kenneth Irby at Columbia University this coming September 
      16, at 8 p.m. in 602 Hamilton Hall (where you can see, in a different 
      medium, 'more or less'/differently, 'what they look like'), as a 'warm-up' 
      before the September 17-19, 2004 Louis Zukofsky Centennial Conference at 
      Columbia/Barnard. <BR></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><IMG height=24
