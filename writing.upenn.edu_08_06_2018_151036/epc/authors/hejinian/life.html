align=left>You spill the sugar when you lift the spoon. My father had filled an 
          old apothecary jar with what he called "sea glass," bits of old bottles 
          rounded and textured by the sea, so abundant on beaches. There is no 
          solitude. It buries itself in veracity. It is as if one splashed in 
          the water lost by one's tears. My mother had climbed into the garbage 
          can in order to stamp down the accumulated trash, but the can was knocked 
          off balance, and when she fell she broke her arm. She could only give 
          a little shrug. The family had little money but plenty of food. At the 
          circus only the elephants were greater than anything I could have imagined. 
          The egg of Columbus, landscape and grammar. She wanted one where the 
          playground was dirt, with grass, shaded by a tree, from which would 
          hang a rubber tire as a swing, and when she found it she sent me. These 
          creatures are compound and nothing they do should surprise us. I don't 
          mind, or I won't mind, where the verb "to care" might multiply. The 
          pilot of the little airplane had forgotten to notify the airport of 
          his approach, so that when the lights of the plane in the night were 
          first spotted, the air raid sirens went off, and the entire city on 
          that coast went dark. He was taking a drink of water and the light was 
          growing dim. My mother stood at the window watching the only lights 
          that were visible, circling over the darkened city in search of the 
          hidden airport. Unhappily, time seems more normative than place. Whether 
          breathing or holding the breath, it was the same thing, driving through 
          the tunnel from one sun to the next under a hot brown hill. She sunned 
          the baby for sixty seconds, leaving him naked except for a blue cotton 
          sunbonnet. At night, to close off the windows from view of the street, 
          my grandmother pulled down the window shades, never loosening the curtains, 
          a gauze starched too stiff to hang properly down. I sat on the windowsill 
          singing sunny lunny teena, ding-dang-dong. Out there is an aging magician 
          who needs a tray of ice in order to turn his bristling breath into steam. 
          He broke the radio silence. Why would anyone find astrology interesting 
          when it is possible to learn about astronomy. What one passes in the 
          Plymouth. It is the wind slamming the doors. All that is nearly incommunicable 
          to my friends. Velocity and throat verisimilitude. Were we seeing a 
          pattern or merely an appearance of small white sailboats on the bay, 
          floating at such a distance from the hill that they appeared to be making 
          no progress. And for once to a country that did not speak another language. 
          To follow the progress of ideas, or that particular line of reasoning, 
          so full of surprises and unexpected correlations, was somehow to take 
          a vacation. Still, you had to wonder where they had gone, since you 
          could speak of reappearance. A blue room is always dark. Everything 
          on the boardwalk was shooting toward the sky. It was not specific to 
          any year, but very early. A German goldsmith covered a bit of metal 
          with cloth in the 14th century and gave mankind its first button. It 
          was hard to know this as politics, because it plays like the work of 
          one person, but nothing is isolated in history--certain humans are situations. 
          Are your fingers in the margin. Their random procedures make monuments 
          to fate. There is something still surprising when the green emerges. 
          The blue fox has ducked its head. The front rhyme of harmless with harmony. 
          Where is my honey running. You cannot linger "on the lamb." You cannot 
          determine the nature of progress until you assemble all of the relatives.</font></p>

align=left> The windows were open and the morning air was, by the smell of lilac 
          and some darker flowering shrub, filled with the brown and chirping 
          trills of birds. As they are if you could have nothing but quiet and 
          shouting. Arts, also, are links. I picture an idea at the moment I come 
          to it, our collision. Once for a time, anyone might have been luck's 
          child. Even rain didn't spoil the barbecue, in the backyard behind a 
          polished traffic, through a landscape, along a shore. Freedom then, 
          liberation later. She came to babysit for us in those troubled years 
          directly from the riots, and she said that she dreamed of the day when 
          she would gun down everyone in the financial district. That single telephone 
          is only one hair on the brontosaurus. The coffee drinkers answered ecstatically. 
          If your dog stays out of the room, you get the fleas. In the lull, activity 
          drops. I'm seldom in my dreams without my children. My daughter told 
          me that at some time in school she had learned to think of a poet as 
          a person seated on an iceberg and melting through it. It is a poetry 
          of certainty. In the distance, down the street, the practicing soprano 
          belts the breeze. As for we who "love to be astonished," money makes 
          money, luck makes luck. Moves forward, drives on. Class background not 
          landscape--still here and there in 1969 I could feel the scope of collectivity. 
          It was the present time for a little while, and not so new as we thought 
          then, the present always after war. Ever since it has been hard for 
          me to share my time. yellow of that sad room was again the yellow of 
          naps, where she waited, restless, faithless, for more days. They say 
          that the alternative for the bourgeoisie was gullibility. Call it water 
          and dogs. Reason looks for two, then arranges it from there. But can 
          one imagine a madman in love. Goodbye; enough that was good. There was 
          a pause, a rose, something on paper. I may balk but I won't recede. 
          Because desire is always embarrassing. At the beach, with a fresh flush. 
          The child looks out. The berries are kept in the brambles, on wires 
          on reserve for the birds. At a distance, the sun is small. There was 
          no proper Christmas after he died. That triumphant blizzard had brought 
          the city to its knees. I am a stranger to the little girl I was, and 
          more--more strange. But many facts about a life should be left out, 
          they are easily replaced. One sits in a cloven space. Patterns promote 
          an outward likeness, between little white silences. The big trees catch 
          all the moisture from what seems like a dry night. Reflections don't 
          make shade, but shadows are, and do. In order to understand the nature 
          of the collision, one must know something of the nature of the motions 
          involved--that is, a history. He looked at me and smiled and did not 
          look away, and thus a friendship became erotic. Luck was rid of its 
          clover.</font></p>

          Back and backward, why, wide and wider. Such that art is inseparable 
          from the search for reality. The continent is greater than the content. 
          A river nets the peninsula. The garden rooster goes through the goldenrod. 
          I watched a robin worming its way on the ridge, time on the uneven light 
          ledge. There as in that's their truck there. Where it rested in the 
          weather there it rusted. As one would say, my friends, meaning no possession, 
          and don't harm my trees. Marigolds, nasturtiums, snapdragons, sweet 
          William, forget-me-nots, replaced by chard, tomatoes, lettuce, garlic, 
          peas, beans, carrots, radishes--but marigolds. The hum hurts. Still, 
          I felt intuitively that this which was incomprehensible was expectant, 
          increasing, was good. The greatest thrill was to be the one to "tell." 
          All rivers' left banks remind me of Paris, not to see or sit upon but 
          to hear spoken of. Cheese makes one thirsty but onions make a worse 
          thirst. The Spanish make a little question frame. In the case, propped 
          on a stand so as to beckon, was the hairy finger of St. Cecilia, covered 
          with rings. The old dress is worn out, torn up, dumped. Erasures could 
          not serve better authenticity. The years pass, years in which, I take 
          it, events were not lacking. There are more colors in the great rose 
          window of Chartres than in the rose. Beside a body, not a piece, of 
          water. Serpentine is fool's jade. It is on a dressed stone. The previousness 
          of plants in prior color--no dream can come up to the original, which 
          in the common daylight is voluminous. Yet he insisted that his life 
          had been full of happy chance, that he was luck's child. As a matter-of 
          fact, quite the obverse. After a 9-to-5 job he got to just go home. 
          Do you have a compulsion to work and then did you have a good time. 
          Now it is one o'clock on the dot, but that is only a coincidence and 
          it has a bad name. Patriots drive larger cars. At the time the perpetual 
          Latin of love kept things hidden. We might be late to the movies but 
          always early for the kids. The women at the parents' meeting must wear 
          rings, for continuity. More sheep than sleep. Paul was telling me a 
          plot which involved time travel, I asked, "How do they go into the future?" 
          and he answered, "What do you mean?--they wait and the future comes 
          to them--of course!" so the problem was going into the past. I think 
          my interests are much broader than those of people who have been saying 
          the same thing for eight years, or so he said. Has the baby enough teeth 
          for an apple. Juggle, jungle, chuckle. The hummingbird, for all we know, 
          may be singing all day long. We had been in France where every word 
          really was a bird, a thing singing. I laugh as if my pots were clean. 
          The apple in the pie is the pie. An extremely pleasant and often comic 
          satisfaction comes from conjunction, the fit, say, of comprehension 
          in a reader's mind to content in a writer's work. But not bitter.</font></p>
