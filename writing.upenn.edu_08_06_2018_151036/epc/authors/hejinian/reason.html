        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Along 
          comes something -- launched in context.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">How 
          do we understand this boundary?</font></font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Let’s 
          begin by proposing it as a dilemma.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The term 
          comes from the Greek, dilemmatos, and means ‘involving two assumptions,’ 
          and so we begin by proposing that the boundary is not an edge but a 
          conjunction -- that the dilemma bears the meaning of conjunction: encounter, 
          possible confusion, alteration exerted through reciprocal influence, 
          etc. -- the kind of situation that is typical, I might add, along borders 
          between nations, between speakers of different languages, between neighboring 
          ecosystems, etc.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> But perhaps 
          my phrase presents more than a dilemma, perhaps it’s a dilemma to excess, 
          since the boundary or border of which I want to speak and the problem 
          of understanding it entail multiple sets of paired assumptions. I could, 
          alternatively, use the term aporia, but to do so (especially since the 
          publication of his book, <i>Aporias</i>) would be to invoke Derrida 
          more definitively than I'm willing to do, lest it predetermine the outcome 
          of my reasoning. But, of course, the dilemma in and of itself (the dilemma 
          which the phrase ‘in and of itself’ so aptly describes) is very much 
          a feature of the poststructuralist postmodernist deconstructionist condition 
          which we -- or which I, as a person and writer -- experience as exerting 
          enormous pressure on our social and aesthetic situation -- which is 
          to say, on our poetics -- a pressure which makes palpable the demand 
          that we have a poetics.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It makes 
          that poetics itself a dilemma -- or it has sense, dilemma (as a border 
          under pressure of doubt, as a border in question) as one of its central 
          features. Dilemma, in this sense, constitutes that part of a poetics 
          which we could call its prepoetics -- a prepoetics functioning not as 
          a condition either logically or chronologically prior to the formulation 
          of a poetics but as a conditon necessary and simultaneous to it -- a 
          current running through it.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> If it 
          is a responsible prepoetics -- that is, one that vigorously questions 
          assumptions, including, or especially, its own -- this current includes, 
          among other things, swarms of contradiction and ambivalence. Perhaps 
          these are inevitable effects of the famous (or notorious) postmodern 
          (or postpostmodern) negativity to which so much thought has been given 
          -- thought directed toward the unthinkable and reflecting an obsession 
          with the unknown, the meaningless, the unspeakable, the unapproachable, 
          the unbearable, the impasse, or, as here, the dilemma -- leaving poetics 
          (and poetry) to be practised in a gap of meaning (a gap produced originally, 
          I would add, by the atrocities of war and social and economic injustice), 
          a gap which extends into the current which I’ calling prepoetics but 
          which one could also call reason.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Reason 
          itself operates in the border between concepts -- and again between 
          several interdependent pairs of concepts. Reason may even constitute 
          such a border zone. The term names simultaneously two lines of causation, 
          an efficient cause (one thing happened and that’s the reason the other 
          thing happened) and a final cause, or telos (the other thing needs to 
          happen and that’s the reason the first thing was made to happen). These 
          reasons are often related: “because I love you I did this to make you 
          happy,” etc. But there are situations in which the two line of causation 
          are completely unconnected, of which the most readily described motivate 
          the events that we dream. Say I happen one rainy evening to watch a 
          documentary about rodeo cowboys and bronc-busting on the television. 
          There are lots of scenes of horses throwing themselves and cowboys into 
          the air, and scenes of horses and, more often, cowboys falling to the 
          ground. That night I dream that I am riding horseback through a dry 
          arroyo when a sudden torrential rainstorm occurs. Within seconds a flash 
          flood is sweeping down the arroyo -- I am knocked from the horse and 
          fall to the ground and the horse falls on top of me. I'm being crushed, 
          and I wake to discover that the pillow has fallen on my face.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Here 
          we have two narratives, a dream narrative and a waking life narrative. 
          The denouement of the dream narrative (dream event B, being crushed 
          by a horse) is, in the dream, a reasonable outcome of my riding a horse 
          through an arroyo and encountering a flash flood (dream event A). In 
          waking life, this same outcome is a reasonable response to having a 
          heavy pillow fall on my head (waking reality event X). The same experience, 
          then, or sensation of an experience, has two unconnected starting points, 
          A and X, initiating two distinct lines of causation.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2</b></font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Along 
          comes something -- launched in context.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is 
          almost automatic to us to assume that this something (on the one hand) 
          and we (on the other) exist independently -- that something was independently 
          elsewhere (out of sight and mind) prior to coming into the zone in which 
          we perceive it and which we, at the moment of this perceptual encounter, 
          designate as context. Furthermore, it is at the moment that we perceive 
          this something that we ourselves come into that context -- into our 
          coinciding (by chance?) with something. The context, in other words, 
          is the medium of our encounter, the ground of our becoming (i.e., happening 
          to be) present at the same place at the same time. By this reasoning, 
          one would also have to say that context too is launched -- or at least 
          that it comes into existence qua context when something is launched 
          in such a way as to become perceptible to us and thereby to involve 
          us -- whomever we are -- strangers (even if, perhaps, only momentarily 
          strangers) to each other previously and now inseparable components of 
          the experience.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> As strangers 
          (foreigners), it is hard for us to find the ‘right words’ (themselves 
          simultaneously demanding context and serving as it) for what we experience 
          in that perception and involvement. </font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Usually 
          comparisons are the first things foreigners make. “The dark castle on 
          the hill is like a cormorant on a rock stretching its crooked wings 
          in the sun” or “The pink wet light in Saint Petersburg on a winter day 
          is like a summer San Francisco fog,” etc. Such comparisons, reaching 
          out of the present situation to another, previously experienced, recollected 
          one, may appear to constitute the ‘making of a context’ for the current 
          context, but a context made in such a way is a transported one, acquired 
          by way of metaphor. And such metaphors, cast in the form of similes 
          and intended to smooth over differences, deny incipience, and to the 
          degree that they succeed, they thereby forestall the acquisition of 
          history.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> But the 
          phrase or sentence with which I’ve become obsessed, “Along comes something 
          -- launched in context,” announces a moment of incipience; one could 
          even say that it is itself, as a phrase or utterance, a moment of incipience 
          -- an appearing, a being born -- coming into what Hannah Arendt calls 
          “the condition of natality,” the condition we all have in common.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Something 
          which wasn’t here before is here now; it appears and it appeared to 
          us, and it is acknowledge by the sensation this is happening. And as 
          such, as a moment of incipience or point of natality, it constitutes, 
          in a very particular and crucial sense, an action -- since (to continue 
          Hannah Arendt’s argument) it is “engaged in founding and preserving” 
          something, which “creates the condition for remembrance, that is, for 
          history” and it thereby undertakes “the task to provide and preserve 
          the world for, to foresee and reckon with, the constant influx of newcomers 
          who are born into the world as strangers.” This “new beginning . . . 
          can make itself felt in the world . . . because [it] possesses the capacity 
          of [itself] beginning something anew."</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3</b></font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To value 
          the new was, of course, a widely held and explicit tenent of modernist 
          aesthetics, as in Pound’s often cited commandment, “Make it new.” Viktor 
          Shklovsky’s more thoughtful, more self-reflexive, and better-analyzed 
          aphorism, “In order to restore to us the perception of life, to make 
          a stone stony, there exists that which we call art” takes the behest 
          further, making newness not an end in itself but a strategy employed 
          for the sake of the enhancement of experience --and as an affirmation 
          of life. “Only the creation of new forms of art can restore to man sensation 
          of the world, can resurrect things and kill pessimism.” Shklovsky goes 
          on, of course, to elaborate a now familiar set of devices intended to 
          restore palpability to things -- retardation, roughening, etc. -- that 
          are major elements (and, in ways that can be taken as troubling, even 
          the stock in trade) of so-called innovative poetry to this day (82 years 
          later)). Contemporary poets -- myself among them -- have embraced this 
          project. Comments variously repeating or attempting to extend Shklovsky’s 
          proposition appear throughout my teaching notebooks:</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Language 
          is one of the principal forms our curiosity takes.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The language 
          of poetry is a language of inquiry.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Poetry 
          takes as its premise that language (all language) is a medium for experiencing 
          experience. It provides us with the consciousness of consciousness.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> To experience 
          is to go through or over the limit (the word comes from the Greek peras 
          (term, limit)); or, to experience is to go beyond where one is, which 
          is to say to be beyond where one was (re. the prepositional form, peran 
          (beyond)).</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Imagine 
          saying that at one stage of life, one’s artistic goal is to provide 
          experience (new or revivified, restored to palpability) and at another 
          (later) it is to provide the joy of that experience.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> After 
          how much experience can one feel free of the fear that one hasn’t lived 
          (the fear of an unlived life)?</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Etc.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> And to 
          a degree what I am attempting to say here is also an extension of the 
          poetics implied in Shklovsky’s aphorism.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is 
          the task of poetry to produce the phrase this is happening and thereby 
          to provoke the sensation that corresponds to it -- a sensation of newness, 
          yes, and of renewedness -- an experience of the revitalization of things 
          in the world, an acknowledgment of the liveliness of the world, the 
          restoration of the experience of our experience -- a sense of living 
          our life. But I want to argue that to produce such a sensation is not 
          necessarily to produce knowledge nor even a unit of cognition but rather 
          to discover context and, therein, reason. </font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Admittedly 
          several obvious (and boringly persistent) problems arise when experience 
          is assigned primacy of place in an aesthetics and its accompanying discourse 
          of value -- when it is given the status of final cause and taken as 
          an undisputed good. First, giving preeminence to experience would seem 
          to demand what gets termed 'authenticity.'</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Happily, 
          one can debunk this on the same basis that one can debunk a second problem, 
          which I could describe as anti-intellectual and ultimately philistine. 
          In assuming a positive value to experience for its own sake, and in 
          advocating thereby an art which heightens perceptibility, one risks 
          appearing to privilege sensation over cogitation, to promote immediacy 
          and disdain critique. There is a danger that one implies that the questioning 
          of experience may serve to distance and thereby diminish at least aspects 
          of it, and that this is antithetical to ‘real’ artistic practice. This 
          is the basis of art’s supposed hostility to criticism, theory (thought), 
          and occasional hostility even to examination of its own history. Or, 
          to put it another way, on these grounds, the philistine romantic attempts 
          to ground his or her rejection of context.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> And here 
          is the basis for a dismissal of these two related problems. One cannot 
          meaningfully say “This is happening” out of context. At the very moment 
          of uttering the phrase, ‘natality’ occurs. And from that moment of incipience, 
          which occurs with the recognition of the experience of and presented 
          by the phrase along comes something -- launched in context through the 
          phrase this is happening, we are in context, which is to say, in thought 
          (in theory and with critique) and in history.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> There 
          is no context without thought and history. They exist through reciprocation 
          of their reason. Otherwise there is no sensation, no experience, no 
          consciousness of living. And, to quote Tolstoi just as Shklovsky does: 
          "If the complex life of many people takes place entirely on the level 
          of the unconscious, then it’s as if this life had never been."</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>4</b></font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As I have 
          said, the recognition acknowledged and sensation produced by the phrase 
          (along comes something -- launched in context) produces another phrase 
          of recognition and sensation, this is happening. It is a phrase with 
          a referent (something -- launched in context), and with an array of 
          particular and important senses. First among them is the implicit but 
          definitive sense that ‘this is real’ -- although, paradoxically, that 
          part of its context which we would term its referent is not necessarily 
          verifiable. For example, were I to claim now to be writing/have written 
          this under conditions of enormous duress or, alternatively, in the spirit 
          of just clowning around, it would be verifiable that I said so but not 
          that I did so. And yet, at least in my imagination as I pictured writing 
          under duress and clowning, I did do so. The realty of the imagined also 
          needs to be affirmed. A second sense accrues to the first one. To the 
          affirmation that ‘this is real’ is added, through the act of recognition 
          and acknowledgment, a sense of one’s own reality -- and this realization 
          -- of a co-reality consisting of correlation and coexistence -- occurs 
          not through the Cartesian logical operation (cogito ergo sum) but by 
          virtue of our context -- a shared context, although it is important 
          to note that it is not the basis or substance of any determinate commonality, 
          and one about which there is something more to be said.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> To some 
          extent, I have let the term history stand as a near synonym to the term 
          context. This is something which, depending on how I would define history, 
          might prove to have some legitimacy, but it shouldn’t, if it is to be 
          a central element in the constituting of a poetics, go unexamined. But 
          if one sees history as, at the very least, a set of relations -- or, 
          to be more precise, of active correlations (co-relations) -- then that 
          seems not too far from a workable characterization of the context of 
          something. And it not only allows one to situate that something within 
          history as a descriptive and explanatory account of what has happened, 
          but it also gives something a history with a future. Context is a past 
          with a future. That is the sense of the phrase this is happening. That 
          is what gives us a sense of reason.</font>

        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So begins 
          George Oppen’s famous poem “Of Being Numerous,” a poem which I read 
          as a testing of the same context, the same reason, that I, perhaps with 
          less clarity and certainly with more verbosity, have been engaged with 
          here. I had not been consciously thinking about Oppen’s poem (nor, by 
          the way, about this essay) when I first wrote and then began to study 
          the phrase which initiated this essay: along comes something -- launched 
          in context. But certainly it has a parallel in the lines that follow 
          those of Oppen’s that I just quoted: “Occurrence, a part / Of an infinite 
          series . . .”</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> One can 
          argue that Oppen (who, as you know, stopped writing poetry for a number 
          of years and instead devoted himself to political activism) separated 
          practical politics from poetry, but this is not identical with separating 
          theoretical politics and ethics from poetry; it is not the same as doing 
          away with a poetics.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Oppen’s 
          poem reflects (on) deep ambivalences over issues which have resurfaced 
          with some sense of urgency in recent discussions about poetic practice, 
          particularly in several recent papers that Barrett Watten has presented 
          and in what turned out to be a controversial talk presented by Bob Perelman 
          at the August 1996 poetry conference organized by Romana Huk in New 
          Hampshire. There, if I read them correctly, Perelman implicitly and 
          Watten explicitly take contemporary “innovative” poetry to task for 
          its withdrawal into numerousness. This is not to say that they reject 
          “numerousness”; on the contrary, they espouse it vigorously both in 
          their politics and in their aesthetics. Nor is it to say that a poetics 
          of possibility is wrongheaded. But if we stop there, we risk a directionless 
          pluralism, one we may claim as a politics but which stops short of activating 
          relationships within that plurality -- and lacking participation in 
          that forming of relationships, “possibility” is likely to turn into 
          what I believe to be a dangerous immanentism.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Similarly, 
          to substantiate possibility as an absolute or to offer it as the telos 
          of a totalizing vision was very much not Oppen’s aim in writing “Of 
          Being Numerous.” </font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Peter 
          Nicholls, in a recent essay entitled "Of Being Ethical: Reflections 
          on George Oppen," points to a resonant relationship between Oppen’s 
          concept of the ‘numerous’ and characteristics of what is being explored 
          under the rubric of ‘community’ in recent books by Jean Luc Nancy (in 
          <i>The Inoperative Community</i>), Giorgio Agamben (in <i>The Coming 
          Community</i>), and Jean-François Lyotard (in <i>The Differend</i>), 
          among others. As Nicholls points out, disturbed both by the totalizing 
          mythos exemplified in Ezra Pound’s writing and by what he termed “the 
          closed universe, the closed self,” Oppen sought, “a poetics founded 
          on the (philosophically) simple recognition of actuality -- ‘That it 
          is’ -- [which] would ultimately concern itself with an equally ‘simple’ 
          and non-agonistic perception of social relationships. Viewed in these 
          terms, poetry might offer a way of acknowledging the world and others 
          without seeking to reduce them to objects of knowledge.” Poetry would 
          sustain “the relationship between things -- the relationship between 
          people; What it is rather than That it is,” as Oppen put it.”</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> But to 
          say that a poetics is “founded on the . . . simple recognition of actuality” 
          is not to say that it ends there. The concluding section of “Of Being 
          Numerous” consists entirely of a passage from a letter Walt Whitman 
          wrote to his mother, a passage describing a public monument seen in 
          dying light. It is the Capital Building in Washington, DC, which is 
          surmounted by an idealized figure of an American Indian in full feathered 
          headdress -- a monument whose intended symbolism must have been of dubious 
          merit to Oppen. The last word of the passage, “curious,” is separated 
          from the text, placed the distance of a stanza break away.</font>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Whitman:

          <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The 
            capitol grows upon one in time, especially as they have got the great 
            figure on top of it now, and you can see it very well. It is a great 
            bronze figure, the Genius of Liberty I suppose. It looks wonderful 
            toward sundown. I love to go and look at it. The sun when it is nearly 
            down shines on the headpiece and it dazzles and glistens like a big 
            star: it looks quite</font>

          <p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Oppen, 
          writing about this passage (in a letter to John Crawford), commented: 
          " . . . the poem ends with the word 'curious.' I had set myself once 
          before to say forthrightly "We want to be here," and the long poem ends 
          almost jokingly with 'curious'. But it is not a joke entirely. If I 
          were asked, Why do we want to be here--I would say: it is curious--the 
          thing is curious--Which may be referred to, briefly, as O's Affirmation."</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> This 
          affirmation’s operative term -- curious -- is situated in yet another 
          of the multivalent phrases which constitute the reason of (and for) 
          my title: it is curious -- the thing is curious. One reading of this 
          phrase could lead to a paraphrase that says something like, “the thing 
          is odd, the thing provokes curiosity,” but another paraphrase could 
          be that “the thing itself exercises curiosity”. The latter interpretation 
          may push Oppen’s intended sense, but not, I believe, with a result that 
          he would dislike.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The term 
          curious, just as it names both a subjective condition (“marked by desire 
          to investigate and learn” or by “inquisitive interest in others’ concerns,” 
          nosiness) and a condition of some object (“exciting attention as strange, 
          novel, or unexpected”), it also names an interaction between curious 
          subject and curious object, an interaction within the terms of curiosity. 
          As Oppen says in another letter, “I ended with the word ‘curious,’ of 
          which the root is curia: care, concern[.]"</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>6</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Oppen 
          so aptly calls an “affirmation,” though it concludes his poem, has a 
          place at the start of it as well, since “affirmation” is what substantiates 
          the phrase “There are things,” and since it is curiosity -- “care, concern” 
          -- which makes that phrase and those things count. But there is another 
          way in which this “affirmation” is not conclusive; “O’s Affirmation,” 
          like the affirmation which is a feature of the poetics I am describing 
          -- one that constantly questions assumptions, especially its own -- 
          is lodged in a dilemma, and therefore in that activity of mind which 
          we term doubt. This doubt is not entirely unlike what Keats called ‘negative 
          capability,’ but what is at stake is affirmation of our deepest reason, 
          the one that tells us that things and our experiences of them count. 
          That is what it means to be in history and in a history with a future 
          -- to be in reason.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> But what 
          we don’t want, of course, is a reason that plows its way to authority.</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In <i>The 
          Human Condition,</i> Hannah Arendt elaborates a notion of a community 
          of reason (in my sense of the term) constituted through action, creating 
          new and hopefully ever better dilemmas for itself. Such a community 
          of reason is boundless, according to Arendt, “boundless because action, 
          though it may proceed from nowhere . . . acts into a medium where every 
          reaction becomes a chain reaction and where every process is the cause 
          of new processes . . . This boundlessness is characteristic not of political 
          action alone, . . . the smallest act in the most limited circumstances 
          bears the seed of the same boundlessness, because one deed, and sometimes 
          one word, suffices to change every constellation. Action, moreover, 
          no matter what its specific content, always establishes relationships 
          and therefore has an inherent tendency to force open all limitations 
          and cut across all boundaries."</font>
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Authority 
          over being is thus dispersed, not because of the boundlessness but in 
          the boundlessness. We don’t -- as writers or as persons -- go beyond 
          “all limitations” and “all boundaries” -- we enter and inhabit them. 
          Faced with the notorious gap in meaning, we may ask What should we do? 
          But we already know what to do. And this knowing what to do is neither 
          derived from nor does it produce guidelines -- either prescriptive, 
          proscriptive or even descriptive. It is, rather, intrinsic to living 
          in context. Not to totalize, not to pre or proscribe -- we know that 
          this is some of what we must do. And we know that this is something 
          we must do because we are alert to the context in which it must be done 
          -- in history and in reason.</font>
