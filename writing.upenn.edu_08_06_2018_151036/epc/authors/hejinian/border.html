        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All the 
          clouds can feel our bodies change<br>
          If we just use some imagination<br>
          Some instigation<br>
          Is that ambition?<br>
          Then let the rains descend<br>
          The imagination is useless unless the mind is free of prejudice<br>
          So that all the faculties can enjoy their objects<br>
          Objects turning day to night<br>
          Appearance to lightsource, fountains to rice<br>
          And what is knowledge in this condition?<br>
          Bondage?<br>
          Flight?<br>
          As if one's image of oneself were now racing ahead in an effort to stay 
          in sight<br>
          So as to be prepared<br>
          When you ask<br>
          Do you want to be lifted?<br>
          What's given is what's between<br>
          A guardian of logic<br>
          Through the gap increasing<br>
          The accuracy of every infinite act<br>
          Yesterday is gone and never was<br>
          And here it is<br>
          So we can go to bed with unity of purpose<br>
          And crave more of the temperament of life in life’s philosophy<br>
          Between<br>
          There we take on not just visibility but inspection and its proper preposition 
          is between<br>
          Where our proprieties have gone<br>
          We place or take them there nocturnally<br>
          Philosophically<br>
          Reflecting on the contrast<br>
          Between scandal and metaphysics<br>
          One wolf tearing the lamb apart while the other gnaws the stone<br>
          Leaving a gap<br>
          Is that love?<br>
          It is always risky to rub sand<br>
          In real time<br>
          Over a diminishing plot<br>
          Each of whose elements is lost in personality<br>
          When the personality consists of nothing but doubts<br>
          It desires to put between<br>
          I'm thinking, someone mumbled<br>
          Thinking that the attention his hands are paying is wandering<br>
          Effacing one distinction only to discover another<br>
          A vast difference between two loves<br>
          And perhaps this can account for the enormous fear some people have 
          of women<br>
          That's easily aroused<br>
          By the invisible realities<br>
          Between beginning and end<br>
          The real plot lying between<br>
          But when we're alone we revert<br>
          To love, and why not? who will know?<br>
          We share in the capacity of narrative to submit to the desires of this 
          or that mind<br>
          Without giving up its secrets<br>
          And speak when no one answers<br>
          I think, the Nightingale Girl said to the Singing Man<br>
          That time requires anecdotes to contradict it<br>
          No answer<br>
          Time longs undividedly for something<br>
          We'll wait<br>
          For an uninterrupted look at the border ghost<br>
          The interpretation<br>
          The pass<br>
          Keeping the secret through the sequence<br>
          Not only through adventures but fairly out of this world<br>
          Given and between<br>
          There the dragonfly clings<br>
          And to this day more people live in countries than in cities<br>
          Where they know the names and habits of both visible and hidden birds<br>
          Being familiar with their practices<br>
          Their sounds<br>
          Crowded together like gossip<br>
          With its transitional and terminal motifs<br>
          And then dispersed<br>
          Though writing like this is something else<br>
          We may look at it<br>
          And what we see is neither before our eyes nor after what we've seen<br>
          The experience of presence here is no clear point in time at all<br>
          Our lives begin in temporal madness<br>
          Which may include taking in the madness of others<br>
          A man with his face muffled to a breast<br>
          A woman looking up from wings<br>
          This concept<br>
          That another's thought or sentiment may be intrinsic to one's own<br>
          Gives birth to eccentricity<br>
          Anger, terror, change to tell<br>
          In the time it takes to say it<br>
          "Once"<br>
          There was a magician who lived in confusion<br>
          There was no accounting for her mutability since she lived entirely 
          alone<br>
          But the number of events it takes to create the probable sequence<br>
          Necessary to cause a change in any person’s state<br>
          Is far larger than one might think<br>
          Therefore any account of it must be very long<br>
          And during all that time<br>
          Reality moves around<br>
          Changing orientation<br>
          Making objects appear<br>
          And this too<br>
          On the social journey between stations in a story<br>
          From 'the headland' to 'the sands'<br>
          Surf to saturated color<br>
          That color to this name<br>
          Bold serpents to the waist<br>
          The vertebrae to crackling rains<br>
          The rain to an imprinted tissue<br>
          The eyeball to a prediction<br>
          The explorer to it<br>
          The egg to travel<br>
          Such to rhyme<br>
          All sentences to sight and sounds of the particular<br>
          Something 'I'm dying to tell you'<br>
          Its free speech shadowed by stories<br>
          One called "The Sad Island" (also named "Carrying Water in a Sieve" 
          though it’s come to be known as "Making a Picture")<br>
          Its moral: If you echo onward you may fit the distance<br>
          Its second moral: The feathers in your cap are inextricable<br>
          Not so, the man said, removing one and running its tip across her lips<br>
          As she shouted<br>
          In link<br>
          In counterpart<br>
          In horror and border<br>
          As if this period of her life would last only a moment<br>
          As something momentarily to oppose<br>
          To cross<br>
          And I can see that in these narrative distortions false inevitabilities 
          appear<br>
          Ordinary motifs, like patterns in linoleum which we discern and know 
          to have no meaning, but which seem nonetheless to assert themselves 
          as if they were determinate, necessitated, and harbingers of moral significance<br>
          And meaning<br>
          Design (perhaps by definition) seems to guarantee outcome<br>
          Better yet<br>
          Each outcome is intermediary -- the very purpose of pattern is to be 
          reassuring<br>
          And yet, since they are saturated with psychical 'pastness'<br>
          Patterns cannot claim limitless purity<br>
          Patterns amplify reality because they both modulate and prophesy our 
          perception of them<br>
          Where at first they seem monotonous they soon become monstrous<br>
          Then is all organization portentous and narrative<br>
          Even when its details are so small, so trivial, that we notice them 
          in idleness (and as idleness)?<br>
          Yet such particulars and specificities<br>
          By increasing the number of the many parts of life<br>
          Seem to dominate the very world to which morality should pertain<br>
          But one cannot sleep if one considers coincidence with cynicism<br>
          Sleep sustains all coexistence<br>
          Much contradiction (spectacle) and discord<br>
          It's like playing music on a glass floor<br>
          The floor cracks<br>
          And the musicians wearing pants to protect their soft tissue keep squealing 
          that they are innocent<br>
          And there is ambiguity<br>
          By playing perhaps placing was meant -- the concept of placement may 
          be important<br>
          Opening the lower lip<br>
          To express homesickness<br>
          That analysis we shouldn't shun<br>
          The kind of book you are reading is a morality tale with overtones of 
          fantasy<br>
          To let the murdering begin<br>
          Freud says 'neurotic men' can't find the female genitals<br>
          Remembered later<br>
          As repetition<br>
          There’s rattling of the blind in the draft as the heat rises<br>
          In slats<br>
          And nervousness results<br>
          As if for no reason at all, like one of those depressing oblique sensations<br>
          An emotion that’s between<br>
          Any of the things one could say about it<br>
          As if it pertained to a secret but the secret were lost<br>
          The regime toppled<br>
          Having been betrayed<br>
          Which, however, far from casting us into the tormented silence of a 
          guilt-ridden venture<br>
          Produces clamor -- music -- mooing, hooting<br>
          Hisses cracking from the interior of objects, putting all that’s private 
          at risk<br>
          For more, sure -- don’t we want to be relevant? kept in stories?<br>
          Stories with their increasingly intimate operatic realism linked<br>
          A story of seeing a naked man on a public street<br>
          A story with love interest linked to that one of the way the story of 
          the Emperor provoked in me the will to believe<br>
          But if his clothes keep showing up on other people there is going to 
          be a crisis of belief<br>
          Then there's a story of a blind man in the Safeway fumbling over peaches 
          as he tries to find ripe ones<br>
          A woman offers to help<br>
          Not the housewife type, more like a professional who knows her way around 
          but thinks her life’s apart, so she hasn't the normal interest in normal 
          things<br>
          She gets a cart and wheels it around the store with the man<br>
          Putting into it what the man says he wants<br>
          Until he's finished<br>
          And he says to the woman<br>
          I don’t have any money<br>
          You'll have to pay<br>
          The moral, said the woman in the kitchen, is this </font><font size=4>

          Moral: Once there was an overthrown Bear King who had been reduced to 
          the rank of colonel by a Would Be Usurper who thought thereby to turn 
          him into a bureaucrat like everyone else. The Bear King countered by 
          taking a scallion as his sceptre. If everyone would do likewise, everyone 
          would be King.</font>

          For changing sexes<br>
          In changing dreams<br>
          A breast appeared, off me, but incompletely <br>
          On the man I am<br>
          A woman I or she<br>
          All of this being ‘gender by degrees’ <br>
          Whose objects give us sensations, especially interesting ones <br>
          Machismo from wolves, nostalgia from the smudge on the book, worry from 
          the cross breeze flapping the shade<br>
          And strange speech from the hole in my tongue<br>
          Frost pressing the orifice <br>
          Crowds of ice under investigation<br>
          We couldn’t do anything today<br>
          I fell asleep in a rubber suit<br>
          You bathed in sugar and were hospitalized for shock<br>
          Allegories are told with a purpose whose possibility is lost<br>
          Until a potato-eater appears and eats potatoes<br>
          In the hotel just across the border from the concert hall<br>
          In a feather bed which holds the sweat<br>
          The complement to up is down, to between is between<br>
          Connections can help us to slip in <br>
          Oh, as Nietzsche said, those humans of old knew how to dream<br>
          And did not need to fall asleep first<br>
          Knowing that you needn’t leave the world<br>
          And that you can’t miss it<br>
          Near and far<br>
          Held in Ovid’s curl<br>
          With dash and wrinkle to call it to your attention<br>
          And whistle to bring it to your dream<br>
          Provoking, perhaps, a psychological turnaround and emotional reversal 
          much like the one that so often occurs in response to a sound one has 
          too long been anticipating and begun to forget -- the sound, for example, 
          of invited guests arriving way after the time appointed and talking 
          noisily as they approach the door, which one perceives not as a pleasant 
          fulfillment of expectation but rather, now, as a sudden, startling interruption<br>
          The void in which one changes at a moment of encounter<br>
          A space, as Heidegger says, for which room must be made room, not at 
          but in a boundary<br>
          A boundary is not that at which something stops but, as the Greeks recognized, 
          the boundary is that from which something begins<br>
          Its essential unfolding<br>
          Room has been made, let into its bounds<br>
          And viewed off a bird<br>
          It is obvious that this is how it works <br>
          In curve<br>
          With the sun between<br>
          Stucco and sensation, narrative and window skills, depth perception 
          and the stretch<br>
          Of the continuous destination<br>
          Whose parturition through wordy lips and hidden flaps<br>
          Is read in a narrative possession of pulled repeats<br>
          Which never expends itself<br>
          But preserves and concentrates its power and is capable of exerting 
          it even after a long time<br>
          In distant places<br>
          The repetition stirred to marvelous travel<br>
          From interior to exterior or from monstrous to minute<br>
          Without the illusion of sequence<br>
          Or victory<br>
          And actually, it’s a lot of fun<br>
          Related to experience<br>
          And its correlate, the ability to follow a story<br>
          Of travellers whose only homeland was an ethics<br>
          They arrived and departed from history untotalled<br>
          The landscape was postcard perfect<br>
          There were many strangers and one woman found a gold tooth in the sand<br>
          "One woman, one woman," said the tooth, “you have found me and now let's 
          talk”<br>
          If the tooth had said "now let's eat" the story that moves on from this 
          point would have developed quite differently<br>
          Just last night I was challenged to an eating context<br>
          And placed before a mountain of polenta<br>
          But how did they organize such a competition? with what criteria and 
          according to what standard did they determine who was to compete?<br>
          Were the competitors grouped according to age? weight? ethnicity? gender?<br>
          Women set to grain, men to milk and eggs<br>
          The tall to fruit, the short to fish<br>
          Whatever conversation there was was off-key<br>
          This must be because the bold creatures were mismatched<br>
          Now they must rest and bare<br>
          Equate or raise<br>
          Alarm<br>
          A household word on promenade<br>
          A fable, fate, an infant prophet, or infant bandit, banal, infamous, 
          professing cacophony and blame<br>
          Resulting in a ‘great chain’ of participation<br>
          Across board<br>
          Over marsh grass<br>
          Near nesting sites<br>
          In space -- in metaphors of space<br>
          Why use them?<br>
          Prospects, zones, or situations<br>
          When notions of the self tend to privilege time<br>
          In which the stature of the naughty nurse can increase<br>
          Biologically<br>
          To utter a drastic challenge: I am not like you!<br>
          Not today, one day, nor once<br>
          But here I am<br>
          It’s dinner time<br>
          But I've got to make just one call -- is that okay? -- it won't take 
          long -- I’ll probably get a machine -- oh -- hi -- I thought I’d get 
          your machine <br>
          And order the environment to picture<br>
          While pressing the unknown<br>
          I cannot see<br>
          I cannot touch the roof<br>
          I close my eyes and cannot hear the things behind me<br>
          With a dull knife I cannot cut<br>
          Likewise, without dirty (words) feet I cannot dance (speak)<br>
          Amazing heat<br>
          And soft limbs connecting consciousness with reality<br>
          An outlying zone<br>
          Our limbs are not limit but fringe<br>
          They swell our skirts<br>
          Our skirts are hung <br>
          They hang for "all and none"<br>
          But it is characteristic of philosophical writing that its relations 
          with the exterior draw the exterior under the skirt<br>
          Mouth open, head back, and the mirror askew<br>
          The question is not why we look but what we feel<br>
          In severed gold soft running clots of (recognition) horror<br>
          Which is serenity<br>
          Reality<br>
          The curtains at the window are stalled by it -- they have been sucked 
          into the room<br>
          As into the confinement crossing a sentence<br>
          From male to female, female to male<br>
          Writing is cross-dressing<br>
          When I speak of gossip I mean talk of the body<br>
          In gossip we pass on its secrets<br>
          Its hidden sex<br>
          The tricks of contraception<br>
          For example<br>
          Switching names<br>
          So that the apple here on the table will name the orange index card 
          beside it<br>
          On which I've written<br>
          There is little proof that the connection is one of cause and effect<br>
          Of compass or character checking<br>
          Defeating time with the countertime of the name (‘your name’)<br>
          In circle<br>
          Which is a singularity, yes, but in return<br>
          So we must practice identification<br>
          Thing<br>
          Door<br>
          Swing<br>
          A joiner<br>
          And that's both a worry and a story<br>
          All this hearing and being heard takes time<br>
          And time’s wagon is filled with old shoes<br>
          Or (in one version of the story) with old wings<br>
          Depending on how the plot begins -- and how it teaches us to remember 
          the vastness of the action (change)<br>
          How to know what and whom to hold accountable<br>
          The history of mutability is very long<br>
          And hence it has long sentences, with increase of semantic duration<br>
          They must include praise and blame<br>
          What we fear, after all, in the mad is their indifference<br>
          As Mandelstam says, nothing strikes terror in a person more than another 
          person<br>
          Who shows no concern at all for him or her<br>
          Rolling<br>
          The wind is blowing<br>
          The teeth in bite dry<br>
          As birds the clock<br>
          To sky<br>
          On which the face is laid<br>
          A joke, Freud says, is a contribution made to the comic by the unconscious<br>
          That sounded promising<br>
          And I suddenly sat up in bed laughing, remembering the acts of violence 
          I'd committed while it was still dark<br>
          In fact, my legs were still tied apart, so that I was off balance<br>
          And that made me laugh all the more<br>
          And toppled me into blood so thick I could shape it<br>
          The result I named and later it thanked me for giving it such a normal 
          name<br>
          In pronouncing it we undertake an enormous journey<br>
          To which we are so accustomed that we travel in our sleep<br>
          Such sleep is devoted to the production of memory<br>
          And memory has a great desire to be understood<br>
          As the very barbarism that this (‘after Auschwitz’) must be<br>
          That the walls may be seen<br>
          Unlike, between<br>
          The way men stand between women<br>
          In cross-dress and incorrigible<br>
          Or, says the interlocutor, women between men<br>
          To repeat, in present tense, what they saw in a dream<br>
          With instrument in hand<br>
          Or mnemonic knot in hem<br>
          As foreigners<br>
          Who might name colors forbidden by the game<br>
          And deliver laughter<br>
          Hooting from their genitals<br>
          In memory<br>
          Gaping<br>
          To receive some better memory device<br>
          I turned on the lamp and let its light shine on the bed<br>
          But it is futile to attempt to reconstitute the present from the pasts 
          between which it is trapped<br>
          Amid physical hazards<br>
          Objects turning in place<br>
          The place requiring a map of where we want to go<br>
          Knocking at a bird hunt<br>
          In passage<br>
          With throats full and only the heads of the dead birds protruding<br>
          Their beaks still working between our lips<br>
          Their busy double<br>
          Pit and opposite<br>
          They smack and speak<br>
          They say some very flattering things<br>
          But somehow the result is that people will suspect<br>
          Excessive change in time will destroy the sensing body parts<br>
          Or excessive change in place<br>
          Many changes occur in truly sadistic installments<br>
          And people get sick in the midst of them<br>
          Seeing their own prone selves on shelves<br>
          Shaking pinky or dick<br>
          Until the senses, overburdened, require that we sleep</font>
