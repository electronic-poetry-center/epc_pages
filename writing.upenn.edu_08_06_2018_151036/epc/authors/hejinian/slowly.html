          <pre><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">   I frequently slowly wish for more of the sudden experience<br>   But it might be that I'll be surprised at myself by myself,<br>i.e., abruptly dismayed<br>   An impulse is something of a summation<br>   An impulse is not a sudden nor an arbitrary act<br>   I can't help but choose<br>   In my jealousy I may take hold of the worl through you<br>and that doesn't bring me any conveniences<br>   But it brings together a large but not infinite<br>accumulation of temporary panoramas<br>   Shown light I could swing around a camera and never<br>hide an &quot;original choice&quot;



   Subjectivity even if not of the curling sky is my<br>duration<br>   All day subjectivity is an endurance awating objects<br>for a minute digressing<br>   And it hopes for objects eager and unbaffled in spaces<br>somewhere near eye level to greet it with comprehension<br>during its waking hours<br>   Everyone knows that in the dream called &quot;Will My Sprit<br>Live On When I'm Dead&quot; as in the dream called &quot;Will I<br>Be Fired&quot; and the dream called &quot;Do You Only Pretend To<br>Love Me&quot; there are no objects<br>   In the dream called &quot;One Who Is Poor Passes By Inch By<br>Inch&quot; there is no object<br>   Subjectivity at night must last hours with nothing to<br>judge but itself<br>   The walls of the hemispheres face and this produces life<br>to closed admiring eyes</font>



<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">   We regularly anticipate this moment at around this hour<br>underway gradually<br>   Images are emitted which through fear I might gradually<br>miss wincing and blinking piecemeal bit by bit<br>   Yet I know that now the day is running well and <br>paralleling yesterday inch by inch<br>   But we'll never get to tomorrow this way<br>   It is under other terms<br>   The fists at the end of the hands strike already<br>   Slowly there are bends in the bank to what happens<br>   Between the two shores down comes a sound track<br>   We get music which is time moving loudly</font></pre>
