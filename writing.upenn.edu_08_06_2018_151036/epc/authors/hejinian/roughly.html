        <h3><font size="2">An interview with Lyn Hejinian by Craig Dworkin, originally 
          published in<i> Idiom</i> #3 (Berkeley: 1995).</font></h3>
        <p><br>
          CD: I wanted to start out with a little history. Over the last decade 
          or so there have been especially fruitful interactions between a certain 
          Russian and American avant-garde; I'm thinking of a book like Leningrad, 
          and of poets like Arkadii Dragomoshchenko, Ilya Kutik, and Alexei Parshchikov. 
          But to look back at the Russian avant-garde from the beginning of this 
          century, their key terms - ostranenia [making strange], sdvig [shift], 
          zaum [beyondsense], zvukopis [visual noise], faktura [materiality] - 
          are all words which could be used to describe our own fin-de-si&egrave;cle 
          American avant- garde. What was the influence from that earlier Russian 
          tradition?<br>
          <br>
          LH: It was very big. When I first started corresponding with Ron Silliman 
          and Barrett Watten in the early 70's, Ron sent me David Melnick's Pcoet 
          and in the accompanying letter mentioned Velimir Khlebnikov. That was 
          the first I'd heard of Khlebnikov, but Ron was writing in a way that 
          assumed I understood, and so I had to find out. Likewise, Barrett was 
          talking about Viktor Shklovsky and the Russian Formalists very early 
          on. By that time several of Shklovsky's books had been translated, and 
          Victor Erlich's big book called <i>Russian Formalism</i> had been published, 
          which we all read and talked about and which had an enormous impact. 
          Erlich's book is still, I think, the most thorough and provocative of 
          the many works about the Russian Formalist movement, but Shklovsky had 
          the direct influence on our sense of literary style and strategies. 
          Barrett's early work Plasma/Paralleles/&quot;X&quot; was very much influenced 
          by Shklovsky.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Do Ron and Barrett know Russian?<br>
          <br>
          LH: Barrett knows a little . And Ron knew a few nouns when we went to 
          Russia; he had a teach-yourself Russian book with stickers, and he had 
          stuck them on appropriate things: &quot;kniga&quot; on a book, &quot;stakan&quot; 
          on a drinking glass, and so on. It was a sweet manifestation of Ron's 
          relationship to words and contexts.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Do you know Jameson's critique of the formalists in <i>The Prison 
          House of Language</i>?<br>
          <br>
          LH: I think it's a really valuable critique, but, ironically, it seems 
          inadequately contextualized. That is, I don't think Jameson has a Russian 
          experience of Russian Formalism, so that even while Jameson is critiquing 
          Formalist theory for being too much of its moment and too little aware 
          of that, he himself is perhaps too much of his own time and place. I'm 
          a little nervous about coming off as too much of a cultural relativist, 
          but while our radical western Marxist ethics are extremely important 
          in the west, they can become displaced (by definition) when one tries 
          to apply them in any other situation; anti-capitalist Marxism, when 
          projected onto the Soviet situation, for example, can go radically askew 
          in ways that are often very unpredictable, and a lot of misinterpretation 
          occurs. But it's been a long time since I've read Jameson's book, and 
          I read it before I ever spent time in Russia. Perhaps, in the new post-Soviet 
          context, his critique would seem pertinent in new ways, Russian Formalism 
          (like &quot;Language Writing&quot;) was a Utopian undertaking, but, 
          as Jameson points out, a powerful Negativity is fundamental to its theory, 
          since it assumes that paradox and revolution are characteristic of literary 
          life.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Do you have plans to go back, now that the republics have re- organized?<br>
          <br>
          LH: They haven't reorganized adequately! No - the last time I was there 
          was in 1991 and it was depressing. And dangerous. I was going to go 
          for a project that Arkadii was organizing; I work off and on for a private 
          detective, and Arkadii had contacts with a television production studio 
          that wanted to do an hour long documentary on this western private detective; 
          the detective was interested, just to go to Russia, and even in the 
          very first discussion with the producers, we were being guaranteed round-the-clock 
          protection by armed guards. I don't want to go to a place like that. 
          Not only because I'm a coward, but because it's depressing. The Russian 
          mafia (or mafias) are really ugly. There's nothing there at the moment 
          that's sufficiently enchanting to draw me back. Most of my Russian friends 
          have left Russia, and the one who is most important, Arkadii Dragomoshchenko, 
          one way or another comes to the U. S. now every year.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Can you e-mail your friends there, despite the local upheavals?<br>
          <br>
          LH: I can e-mail Arkadii. He was working for an American business for 
          a while; I never understood what he was doing, but they gave him e-mail. 
          He's quit that job now, but he's kept the e-mail. That's why I first 
          got e- mail, actually, to be able to communicate with him. And he's 
          still the main person I send messages to.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Speaking of Russian (or speaking in Russian), the title of your 
          book <i>Oxota</i> gets translated as &quot;The Hunt&quot; - the Zasterle 
          Press selections were entitled <i>The Hunt</i> and the selections translated 
          into French came out under the title <i>Le Jour de Chasse</i> - but 
          &quot;oxota&quot; also means &quot;desire&quot; in Russian. I was wondering 
          what your thoughts were on the relation of desire both to writing, which 
          some of your work has explored, and also to reading.<br>
          <br>
          LH: The second part of that question is actually the more interesting 
          one, because it's one that people don't usually ask. I think a lot has 
          been written or said about the relation of desire to language itself: 
          the way eros and the quest for knowledge are interwoven in the psyche, 
          and the way language plays a role, therefore, in the quest for knowledge, 
          since it always pretends to be the vehicle both for gaining knowledge 
          and for passing it on. That's especially true in western models, where 
          so much of modern linguistics emerged in the wake of scientific writing 
          in the 17th century. The quest for knowledge has always been connected 
          with a language project of some kind or other. Writing is also linked 
          to the desire to tell, which seems to be a real primordial impulse; 
          we're like little kids: &quot;I want to be the one to tell.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          That, I think is probably an attempt to make the epistemological project 
          an unmediated one, where a word really could be the thing, where one 
          could leap the gap between sign and signifier, in Saussurean terms, 
          say. And since one can't leap that gap, since we absolutely know that 
          in fact we are always dealing with mediation in language, desire is 
          never effaced; there's no ultimate satisfaction. So writing is always 
          full of desire; it is completely cathected in complex ways: around power, 
          around sex, around possession, around wanting certainties, around flirtations 
          with uncertainties, with unknowing, approaching death and pulling back. 
          All of those metaphysical and theoretical aporias are part of the desire 
          system.<br>
          <br>
          So now, to consider the question about reading. There have to be similarities 
          between the relation of desire to writing and its relation to reading, 
          Reading too can have the features of a quest - certainly it is a reaching 
          out into the world, in order to see what someone else has seen or said, 
          or to learn something. Curiously - paradoxically? - the reading experience 
          seems more interior, even though it begins in the world, than writing, 
          though writing begins - or seems to begin -&nbsp;within. But maybe that's 
          wrong - maybe writing begins not in the self but in language, which 
          is far larger than the self, and prior to it. So writing, like reading, 
          begins at a point which is &quot;not-I.&quot; Reading and writing both 
          have their origins in the largeness or plenitude of desire. And writing 
          expresses it, while reading interiorizes it.<br>
          <br>
          I don't want to make too much of the distinction between the two modes, 
          however. The writer, after all, is immediately the reader of what's 
          just been written. There's a kind of exchange going on here that seems 
          important to think about. I've just been re-reading Walter Benjamin's 
          little essay called &quot;The Storyteller&quot; in <i>Illuminations</i>, 
          about the Russian writer Nikolai Leskov. In that essay Benjamin talks 
          about the decline of the storyteller, which is a decline of community 
          experience, of &quot;exchanging experience&quot; as he calls it. Benjamin 
          says that with the invention of the printing-press the storyteller becomes 
          isolated, and story telling moves into the area of the novel, the genre 
          at the point of greatest isolation. I think he is right. I also think 
          that poetry may be very close to storytelling, in that it offers readers 
          the opportunity to participate - first and especially because poetry 
          tends to encourage readers to subvocalize the text (enunciate it to 
          themselves - sound it out), but second because poetry generally doesn't 
          over-explain itself. Even conventional poetic devices can be read as 
          an attempt to represent something raw, something unmediated.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, different kinds of reading of different kinds of material 
          provoke different kinds of desire, and maybe some have no desire in 
          them at all. Those works would be predicated on closure. In &quot;The 
          Storyteller,&quot; Benjamin considers a comment (I don't remember the 
          source of the comment) that a person who dies at the age of thirty-five 
          is always a person who died at the age of thirty-five and Benjamin adds 
          that nonetheless that person is never someone who will die at the age 
          of thirty-five except in novels. Novels commence at closure -&nbsp;they 
          are written in the past tense, after the death of the characters and 
          after the completion of the events. Death in the novel results in isolation 
          - in the isolation of the novel reader. Benjamin's comment is that people 
          read novels in order to warm their frozen lives with the warmth of another's 
          death. I would speculate that death in poetry takes the form of absence 
          rather than isolation, providing rather than cutting off the space into 
          which desire can turn its longings.<br>
          <br>
          CD: You mentioned the printing press, and Benjamin of course talks about 
          how technology has affected the arts. There are arguments that the stylistics 
          of the avant-garde of the last twenty years or so have been influenced 
          by electronic and digital media. But I'm not sure that I see such a 
          great formal difference between that writing and an earlier avant-garde, 
          such as the works collected for Bob Brown's &quot;reading machine&quot; 
          in the late '20's, which came about, perhaps, because of the invention 
          of the typewriter and film. Do you think we're yet seeing the affects 
          of digital media and the computer on contemporary writing?<br>
          <br>
          LH: I think I see a powerful effect on its social contexts. A great 
          deal of literary activity is taking place on e-mail now - lively and 
          troubling examples being the &quot;poetics list&quot; originating in 
          Buffalo or the &quot;description of an imaginary university&quot; coming 
          out of SUNY-Albany. E-mail is a strikingly male-dominated medium at 
          the moment - it's founding &quot;community&quot; on male-dominated gossip.<br>
          <br>
          CD: M-a-l-e, not m-a-i-l?<br>
          <br>
          LH: M-a-l-e, yes. The problem isn't so much aesthetic as social. E-mail 
          produces a peculiar kind of community - one which is markedly aggressive, 
          given to gossip and bullying. There's an amazing vocabulary for modes 
          of being &quot;present&quot; in this community - people who are readers 
          but not writers on the e-mail poetics list, for example, are being called 
          &quot;lurkers&quot; or sometimes &quot;muffins.&quot;<br>
          And there are terms for some of the forms of aggression, such as &quot;bombing&quot; 
          and &quot;flaring.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          CD: Which are?<br>
          <br>
          LH: I might have the terms reversed, but I think &quot;bombing&quot; 
          is where a perfectly well socialized, nice person gets behind his or 
          her computer on the e-mail and starts viciously attacking other people. 
          Presumably this comes about because the e-mail doesn't have social mediations.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Or because there is too much mediation: that they're not face-to- 
          face.<br>
          <br>
          LH: That too. But in any case the boundary between private thought and 
          public thought, or between spoken and unspoken are blurred. So that's 
          &quot;bombing,&quot; and &quot;flaring,&quot; if I have the terms right, 
          is when you send a message to somebody which is actually very good, 
          and you just can't resist having everyone see how clever you've been 
          or what a good idea you've had, so you send the message so that everybody 
          gets it whether they need it or not; it's like showing off.<br>
          <br>
          CD: These sound like things Marinetti would have loved: electronic &quot;bombing,&quot; 
          &quot;flaring&quot; - the boys showing off.<br>
          <br>
          LH: Exactly. It's not the perfect social context for poetry.<br>
          <br>
          In looking over the list of questions you gave me in preparation for 
          this interview, I was thinking about the influence of other arts on 
          contemporary writing; I agree with you that the other arts have influenced 
          contemporary writing, but I also think that those qualities in the other 
          arts that are influencing contemporary writing and being influenced 
          by it are coming out of an attention to the culture at large&nbsp;- 
          especially the media: film, television, and advertising. This exchange 
          of influence is affecting pacing, narrative strategies, post-modern 
          juxtapositions, use of the simulacral, play with commodification and 
          anti-commodification, obfuscation as eros, etc. Most of the writers 
          I'm interested in are paying attention to the media; they're interested 
          in the kinds of sentimentalization that is going on in media, the replacement 
          of narration by over-interpreted information or disinformation, with 
          disinformation as the narration of our times.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Bob Brown, whom I mentioned earlier, says that his avant-garde poetics 
          derived from reading Stephen Crane's <i>Black Riders and Other Lines,</i> 
          Gertrude Stein's <i>Tender Buttons,</i> commercial ticker-tape, and 
          the electronic advertisements on the billboard skyline which had emerged 
          in New York City in the twenties.<br>
          <br>
          LH: That makes complete sense.<br>
          <br>
          CD: To go from technology back to science - you mentioned the connexion 
          between scientific and linguistic theories - I'm curious about the connexion 
          I sense in some of your work between the terms &quot;myopia&quot; 'hypochondria,&quot; 
          and &quot;writing.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          LH: I'd have to think a while about &quot;hypochondria,&quot; but I 
          think I've used that as a metonym for a sense of the dysfunctionality, 
          or the unworkability, of the self in its previous, romantic incarnations 
          and manifestations. I've also used it as a metonym for anxiety in general 
          in order to suggest something of the way it is literally embodied. Anxiety 
          is experienced as an interior condition, but it is a form of fixation 
          - a form of bondage; like hypochondria, it is a psychic condition with 
          physical implication. Otherwise I don't particularly suffer from hypochondria.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, because our models of perception are geared towards vision 
          and sight, &quot;myopia&quot; is a handy metaphor for uncertainties 
          vis- &agrave;-vis perception, an awareness that what you perceive may 
          not be what's there - that distortions are intrinsic to perception. 
          I am myopic.<br>
          <br>
          The notion of &quot;myopia&quot; is linked to perception and replicability; 
          western science bases its definitions of knowledge on certainties, and 
          certainty requires that something be perceivable repeatedly. This is 
          interesting in terms of Stein's argument that there is no repetition, 
          which would have to mean there is no certainty, while at the same time 
          she considered herself a realist writer and, like me, she was very enamored 
          of the scientific method: requiring patience, careful observation, an 
          attempt not to over-interpret, to let the thing be itself.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Description would be another term from that lexicon; I like the 
          idea of Steinian scientists &quot;insisting&quot; on experiments (to 
          use another of her terms) rather than &quot;repeating&quot; experiments.<br>
          I read that your &quot;Two Stein Talks&quot; are going to be republished; 
          are there going to be significant revisions? Have you changed your thoughts 
          on Stein?<br>
          <br>
          LH: No, I've changed almost nothing. That particular re-publication 
          is to be one of those really expensive fine art editions from Weaslesleeves 
          Press, but I do want to re-publish them in a version that's available 
          to more people. There are a few more essays I want to write, and then 
          I would like to put out a volume of collected essays, including the 
          Stein pieces.<br>
          <br>
          CD: To bring that question of availability back to Stein herself, why 
          do you think she is at the same time one of the few poets who is really 
          a household name and also almost entirely excluded from the canon of 
          anthologies and university curriculums.<br>
          <br>
          LH: Well, remember she's a household name as a cultural figure and not 
          as a writer; the people who use her name, or think that they're summoning 
          something by using her name, generally haven't read her writing at all. 
          In fact, she's an emblem of things which are quite separate from her 
          writing. I think that one of the reasons Stein doesn't make it in the 
          academy is that there is no exemplary work, there's no work you can 
          read and thereby not have to read anything else; her work is irreducible 
          and unsynopsizable, because for every proposition that she makes, she 
          also makes counter-propositions; her whole project is an enormous and 
          spreading study of the relationships of everything to everything else, 
          beginning with the <i>Making of Americans,</i> in which she categorizes 
          different kinds of people and then realizes that oppositions don't work; 
          she abandons the <i>Making of Americans</i> when she sees that there 
          are co-existing ontological possibilities, that they're always vibrating 
          next to each other, and that there are vast numbers of them. That's 
          something that contemporary physicists can deal with, but contemporary 
          literary critics are driven crazy by that degree of plenitude and then 
          they blame Stein.<br>
          <br>
          CD: What do you think of Stein's recent appropriation by feminist critics 
          who take her as an exemplary anti-patriarchal figure? My reservation 
          is that Stein seems like the ultimate patriarch: her relationship to 
          Alice, her apodictic pronouncements, her Caesarian third person, the 
          fascist project of describing and categorizing every type of person. 
          How do you see that Stein co-existing with the Stein who demolished 
          patriarchal language?<br>
          <br>
          LH: I think that the use of Stein by contemporary feminists may not 
          be accurate about Stein, but that it may still be useful. Otherwise, 
          I would disagree with the use of your word &quot;fascist.&quot; &quot;Authoritarian,&quot; 
          maybe, but not &quot;fascist,&quot; just to be accurate; it's more bourgeois. 
          Well, but then so is fascism. . . .<br>
          <br>
          CD: It was an intentionally provocative choice of words.<br>
          <br>
          LH: I really don't think her work is fascist, but I agree with you that 
          it's patriarchal, and I think maybe the weakness that you're seeing 
          in the feminist re-making of Stein is in the inadequacy of the definition 
          of &quot;the feminine.&quot; To include Stein's patriarchal poetics 
          within the realm of <i>&eacute;criture feminine</i> - and to give a 
          reading of Stein that will permit itself to turn around and be read 
          by Stein - would be of great value.<br>
          <br>
          CD: The academy has had difficulty dealing with experimental writers 
          like Stein, but of course Barrett Watten, your co-editor at <i>Poetics 
          Journal,</i> has joined the list of other experimentalists from your 
          generation who now hold teaching positions in the academy: Charles Bernstein, 
          Susan Howe, Bob Perelman, Michael Davidson - how do you see this migration 
          changing the course of writing?<br>
          <br>
          LH: Well obviously I hope it has a good effect. When we started and 
          were taking up an oppositional literary position, we really knew what 
          we were opposing; it wasn't just oppositionalism for its own sake, it 
          really was an attack on the catastrophe resulting from the hypocritical 
          failure of western capitalism and American individualism to examine 
          . . . practically anything. The Language movement was actually a very 
          utopian project; it has been from the beginning, and from the very beginning 
          it included a utopian view of an academy - although admittedly as an 
          anti-academy: an enclave within an academy, or an academy outside The 
          Academy.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Something like Black Mountain started out as?<br>
          <br>
          LH: Something like OPOYAZ; that was the inspiration. We even talked 
          about it: renting a building, starting a school. There was never anything 
          we said that took paedagogy to be contrary to poetry or to poetics. 
          On the contrary: we said that this writing is a kind of unfolding procedure 
          related to analytical thinking - which was, by the way, a way of acknowledging 
          the intense social importance of poetry. Poetry is an enormously social 
          activity, and not only because poets have to invent their communities 
          and sustain friendships with each other in order for poetry to get a 
          readership, but also because it already calls out for that, it really 
          is an ongoing making of a world through thought and exchange of thought. 
          So teaching is really appropriate.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Given that understanding of poetry as a social activity and the 
          desire for an oppositional poetry which could operate in the political 
          realm, one of the chief obstacles seems to be that like the fine press 
          edition of the &quot;Two Stein Talks,&quot; the poetry from this oppositional 
          avant-garde was being published in extremely limited editions: three-hundred 
          and five- hundred copies. How do you see the oppositional effectiveness 
          of a writing which has a necessarily small audience?<br>
          <br>
          LH: It had such a good audience. It's clearly had efficacy; it's had 
          readers, followers, imitators. And also it's freaked people out, it's 
          made enemies. Apparently <i>The New York Times</i> just had an article 
          in the Sunday magazine on American poetry and names Language Poetry 
          as absolutely incomprehensible and vicious.<br>
          <br>
          CD: That confirms all kinds of things I've always thought about <i>The 
          New York Times.</i><br>
          <br>
          LH: With the Tuumba Press books, I think the most I ever printed was 
          five- hundred copies, but certainly more than five-hundred people read 
          them. And presses play all kinds of roles - certainly the Tuumba edition 
          of a work was not the final publication, it was a way of getting news 
          out. And Tuumba press published the first books of lots of people.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Cost, though, is another problem of accessibility for our contemporary 
          avant-garde. Johanna Drucker's books, for instance, are fascinating 
          and brilliant and absolutely beautiful, but they're also well out of 
          most people's price range.<br>
          <br>
          LH: Yeah, part of the things I liked about Tuumba Press was that it 
          was letterpress on beautiful paper - and then roughly stapled. And they 
          only cost a couple of dollars.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Those bibliographic details can tell quite a bit. On the one hand, 
          there's a poetry characterized in part by certain &quot;postmodern&quot; 
          theories of the self, a poetry being written as if to illustrate the 
          much-hailed &quot;death of the author,&quot; and then on the other hand 
          there's the increasing size of author photos in books from The Figures, 
          and the fact that the biographical blurbs in the back of Sun &amp; Moon 
          books have been steadily increasing. How do you account for that discrepancy?<br>
          <br>
          LH: Unprincipled careerism. The marketing of books. It's something I've 
          never really thought about. Somehow the picture on the book didn't seem 
          to be anymore me than the pronoun &quot;I&quot; - but I see your point, 
          it's a very good question. Those blurbs on the Sun &amp; Moon books 
          are by Douglas Messerli; the writers don't have any control over that.<br>
          <br>
          CD: As the same writers and same works which Tuumba announced start 
          to be picked up and re-printed by larger small-presses, like Sun &amp; 
          Moon, or by anthologies like the new Norton Postmodern, what at one 
          point might have been described as a coterie poetry has the chance to 
          reach a larger audience - how do you see that change?<br>
          <br>
          LH: I think it's problematic. It's a problem for us. You've used the 
          phrase &quot;the coffins of poetry&quot; before to describe the Norton 
          Anthologies, but I've been thinking of it more as a brick in the mausoleum. 
          Or, more troubling, a brick in a monument. Both the big Messerli anthology 
          and the Norton have the overt ambition to define and historicize a lot 
          of activity, and they're going to do that. They are going to be, for 
          a long time now, the avenue through which people come to understand 
          and be exposed to this work. That may be good for your generation: there 
          it is, that's history, now we can get on with what we're doing. But 
          for me, the big challenge is to remember that this story is not adequate, 
          that it's not the whole story, that these books don't feel like what 
          it really was - they don't really show it.<br>
          <br>
          And the big question: what's next? That's what I've been talking about 
          with everybody -&nbsp;Barrett Watten, Bob Perelman, Carla Harryman, 
          Michael Davidson, Kit Robinson, Ron Silliman, Rae Armantrout, Charles 
          Bernstein - what's next? Obviously, there are writers of my generation 
          who are repeating themselves, but others are looking ahead, pushing 
          invention and cogency into an expanding notion of poetry. I think immediately 
          of Carla Harryman, whose work constantly reaches new dimensions of wit 
          and power.<br>
          <br>
          CD: So you see this process of definition as ultimately helping not 
          just writers of my generation, but also having the potential to liberate 
          the writers in those anthologies: spurring them to move on and &quot;make 
          it new&quot;?<br>
          <br>
          LH: Yes. Although it did depress me when those two books came out. I 
          mean, I am happy to be in them, and I appreciate their usefulness, but 
          the limits they set have the potential to be depressing.<br>
          <br>
          CD: Right, my first thought was: &quot;good god, it's over.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          LH: But it's not. The challenge now is to make certain that it is not 
          over.</p>
