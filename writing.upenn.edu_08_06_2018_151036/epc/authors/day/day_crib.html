    <p class="body_justified">5. For me,  everything is physical: beginning, ending, and especially 
the practice  required to get from one to the other. (Spaghetti, after all, though  repetitious, begins and ends in my hands.) Take beginning: In an age of  comic genitalia, I find myself funny all the time, that is, to the  extent that I find myself. When I wake up I am always translating backward  into an original language; the seed is forever opening and the husk  misplaced. Light, for example, comes and goes without  accruing any particular meaning, unless you count 
memory, but I'm  getting ahead of myself to find a vantage from 
which to look back.  Back to this light; is it audible? Emotional? To 
call it blue  situates it in the sky, which is accurate but not sufficient to my condition,  what you might call the passion in me. Do scholars feel this way  too? I am completely unaware of any end point; in 
fact, I understand  the progress of a day in terms of genre, the seamless transition from  one to the next; one minute I'm waving good
bye and the next I'm  overwhelmed in the hallucinatory hellos of milk. Or led over  that mountain now to the next horizon. My hand 
is exactly me in  that blue I mentioned earlier, following her, inventing itself. Such are  the powers of periphrasis.</p>

<p class="body_justified">7. &quot;Thank you,  this chaos was wonderful.&quot; We had been talking about time, whether, in  terms of experience, we should call this noon, night, or morning and whether,  in any case, the metaphor might be allowed to come back and eat itself, as we  have so often been tempted to do. I was in bed with my desirabilia, cozy in contemplating  the interdependence of my first words with the sounds of theirs and the silent  ones in pictures. I mean, it's something of a relief to know it's not wholly up  to me to invent the shadows, even the best of my own future thoughts. Then I  fell asleep and dreamed briskly of leaving home (it was a national act), of the  march of human history over my backyard&mdash;but that set off a certain squawking,  then sirens, and suddenly I felt mad to suck but unsure whether this was a  conservative or merely punctual instinct. A case of <em>temps perdu</em> or prelude to the seriousness of a kiss? Later I may innovate  ...</p>
