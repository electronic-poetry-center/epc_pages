        Aren't  we all autodidacts?<br />
        The nature  of pleasure is its lack of completion<br />
        Someone  bring taxis to Finland Station!<br />
        You,  grasshopper, you are so sexual<br />
        and me,  entirely colloquial<br />
        For the  private reveals nothing<br />
        but the  dense unstable light of thought<br />
        And the  word for them, a thing for us, floats<br />
        coolly  ripped in three<br />
        while  for A. the wife may disappear<br />
        in any  normal spin<br />
        for the ether is full of its own astronomy<br />
        <br />
        Naked at  midnight<br />
        rational  at last<br />
        I break  the bands<br />
        to quiet  the cackle<br />
        of my  production from your head, my friend!<br />
        If I had  a totem it would be a rock<br />
        and if I  had a work it would be a song<br />
        None of  the rocks are unspoken for<br />
        open to light from above<br />
        <br />
        Yet we  do not always appear in the company of innovators<br />
        A  businessman has fallen through the glass of the bar<br />
        It is everyone's  business to translate<br />
        B. and  C. converse in Monk tunes<br />
        E., F.,  and G. haggle and smoke<br />
        The  telephone snitches<br />
      H. sits  quietly by her ideas            </p>
      <p>The moment  has almost already passed<br />
              A first  glimpse, filmy sun, just as red<br />
              draws  the evening in<br />
              ends a  nap, voices<br />
              in all  my ears<br />
              The  nature of pleasure is its beak of confusion<br />
              after  the street, in a silent drone, toward a rumor of<br />
              someone  else's good<br />
              I make  it up as I dwindle, shoes into sandals, sandals<br />
              into  wood, then before<br />
              the plow<br />
              It is  said we will go to Pushkin tomorrow<br />
              My  friends we will suffer<br />
              our  heads in brown bags<br />
              and  without music, bread, or salt, using words as mere noises<br />
              our own  names heavy in the mouth<br />
              on the  books<br />
              in the  street<br />
              When <em>I</em> was a schoolboy<br />
              the  meaning of music itself subverted the horn<br />
              like the  way we show our teeth when we smile, noticing<br />
              the  gap-toothed men are Ukrainians<br />
  &quot;I&quot;  recedes into its own logic, a perspective drawing<br />
              of the  paths of our walking ids<br />
              I can't  hear you over the roar of drunken ids<br />
              I sleep  for awhile<br />
              A brown water surrounds me<br />
              <br />
              In TV  melodramas the sexual fantasies of youth collapse<br />
              into the  horror of the purges<br />
              (from  nowhere, like us, all interested in the same dress)<br />
              No sir.  This is just a pile of blankets<br />
              And out  there, something will be built<br />
              sometime  this century, not today<br />
              Did you  see L's big hands?<br />
              In fact  none of us sleep, smoking instead, gazing<br />
              at the  Fontanka from the bar&mdash;<br />
              Is that  a factory or a hotel? Who rode that<br clear="all" />
            horse-poet?  Her unsocialist loneliness<br />
              got her<br />
              But it is a dead city, dead<br />
              <br />
              Listening,  and then I speak<br />
              Often we  recall the old country. For them I am only<br />
              a  Russian, but here it can be like a photograph<br />
              posed  and understood in psychological terms. It's nothing<br />
              He stole  something. Equivocal the mind<br />
              as the  impolite handshake lingers. For I am weak<br />
              and the  sun casts a shadow over my fingers<br />
              at the  machine. I am small<br />
              and  significant in my passion, a grasshopper<br />
              Often I  recall the days of my friends<br />
              consubstantial  with me<br />
              on bus  no. 5<br />
              fattening  as we pass each factory and prison, lighting up<br />
              as we  recognize &quot;repair.&quot;<br />
              And from  myself to be taken, the concept of which my friends<br />
              cannot  have, is the extreme of both pleasure and torture<br />
              object  of the whale's gaze<br />
              We must  be a little bit &quot;fatigated&quot; by the brain<br />
              I think<br />
              or we  are giants who, having met, walk into a cloud<br />
              Then, we should have bigger plans<br />
              <br />
              J. holds  the knife and fork as though she herself<br />
              were the  dish. There is no abstract language<br />
              for  theories of knowledge<br />
              and the  everyday passing of our time as happily and agreeably<br />
              as  possible<br />
              Then we  rush through the state, a film of grime<br />
              the  shifting crowd<br />
              spirit  soul and breath, just as flavors are sweet or bitter ...<br />
              It was  in my dream I floated above you, creative<br />
              (as  behavior goes) however instantly the word<br />
              might be  required. Yet the word was not available when<br />
              we set  our sights, stood<br />
      like the  Czar's statuary on rooftops<br />
      desperate  to break<br />
              into  song. &quot;Destiny? I laugh at it<br />
              As for  men ... !&quot; And the crowd feigning sleep<br />
              The  pattern is permanently disturbed<br />
              the  memoir artificially organized<br />
              reality,  senseless<br />
              And so,  a dirty doorway opens suddenly on a &quot;view&quot;<br />
              jump  cuts the &quot;stroll&quot; as they say<br />
              For us  this is not a city but a monument;<br />
              our friends, beings in time<br />
              <br />
              Irrelevant<br />
              I am not  myself the last socialist<br />
              All over  Europe, women<br />
              like  grasshoppers&mdash;every day I would receive such complaints<br />
              and  every day translate I am no trouble<br />
              but  nevertheless exiled. What's inside a coat?<br />
              a <em>coup</em><br />
              We are  never not foreign<br />
              and put  on our binoculars. Pleasure<br />
              outweighs  the horror of our concept of everything, or that is the<br />
              question.  &quot;Of course you have noticed our newspapers<br />
              reprint  absolutely no comment on our American confusion&quot;<br />
              but as  dreamers we reproduce our own<br />
              work,  own the means of<br />
              the  frame, which is time, but she has her own butter<br />
              in her  head. K. asks, &quot;Mother, must I keep on<br />
              dancing?&quot;  &quot;Let's go up backwards<br />
              and see  what we look like&quot; L. replies<br />
              My  perverted feeling of privacy, of the horizontality<br />
              of rain,  comes into play in this world we create to write<br />
  &mdash;off in  the snow bare-chested<br />
              with  twelve white huskies<br />
              or  thereabouts. Authenticity? M.'s pants<br />
              say  &quot;Bitume Story.&quot; When I met you I walked<br />
              into a  cloud, but then something is always named<br />
      something.  And finally it sees you            </p>
      <p>The  nature of humans is to have left something out<br />
              in the  world, yet we do not always appear<br />
              in full  abstraction<br />
              In fact,  the light is never perfect<br />
              but what  is stronger than light, etc.?<br />
              The  strange happy man, following us on the metro, became<br />
              hairier  and even more lovable as we hurried on ahead<br />
              and the  intellectual had become his own character, this time<br />
              a  nightmare. The first secretary, then<br />
              is  certainly a prince in his governmental duties<br />
              To him  we are all business<br />
              Fresh  off the tree<br />
              like a  wave surely reaching<br />
              the most  obscure localities<br />
              where  pitiably the translator, too, waits in line<br />
              I will  fetch my raft from wherever we have gotten to<br />
              in the  things that last but are not separate<br />
              We are our own principles<br />
              <br />
            We will  walk for one hour</p></td>
