      <p><em>a miraculous branch? So, my friend, into a hubbub</em></p>
            <p>
              the  prolapse of waiting for a reason to come<br />
              clear.  Buffalo Bill put his money on Laugh Cream,<br />
              The  Great Lung Healer; for us it's all one<br />
              big  bucket of, dare I say-I don't dare say. Alertly<br />
              adaptive  and widely recursive he reaches<br />
              his  imported hand out to canvas the once-mountain stream for what it<br />
              was, a  stanzaic meditation on making do. So<br />
              with a  soda in the other and a way of &quot;singing<br />
              in his  own head,&quot; Bill met me recovering<br />
            from the  strange and wonderful history</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>nothing stands still to witness. A process with no  necessary end</em></p>
      <p>
        exiled  in the sun. Got up, felt dubious<br />
        in the  tedious accumulation of nothing important<br />
        nothing  bungling nothing erratic and I sometimes hoped<br />
        as they  say in the sea<br />
        for a  volcanic eruption of gorgeous arrows flying<br />
        from a  string of once and for all gentle thoughts<br />
        Was  anyone ever actually &quot;handsome in triumph&quot;?<br />
        For the  sand in domestic jars<br />
        can't be  counted and the future tense<br />
      refers  to nothing outside the present. The free agent</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>smokes. We picks up where I left off</em></p>
            <p>in every  matter, measure. But you are full of it<br />
              matter,  I mean. &quot;Water, upon which waves, upon<br />
              which a  bundle of sensitive particles, woman or<br />
              ventrical  through which the spectacle of a capital Man rocks the touch<br />
              of the  free radical at a hard<br />
              time.&quot;  Yet it is not so co-eternal with you<br />
              this  most ridiculous structure<br />
              fallen  on latex and line<br />
              this the  case is (she or he)<br />
      who  always stands where a beginning was</p></td>
