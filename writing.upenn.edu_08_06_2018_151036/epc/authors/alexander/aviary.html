<font size="-1">&quot;The poem was written as a kind of response to an outdoor site-specific installation by artist Cynthia Miller (my wife) at the Tucson Botanical Gardens. In the installation, painted sticks, beads, hanging hoops, and
other objects were placed along a walkway in the gardens. These objects were in bushes, in branches of trees, and along a wooden fence. In a way they were very unobtrusive, and one could conceivably walk along and not notice them at all. But if one began to notice, then more and more would be
seen. When installing the work, soon after hanging a red hoop in a tree, a hummingbird came and flew through the hoop.
<p>
&quot;The poem was written soon after this installation was put up. At a later time, Karl Young asked for a work for his screen folds series from Light & Dust Books, and I sent him this work, along with a newer drawing by Cynthia Miller made specifically to accompany the poem in this form which I
designed to be a part of Light & Dust's screen fold series. Thus the work became a collaboration between Cynthia, Karl, and me. It was published as a collaborative effort by Light & Dust Books (Kenosha, WI), Chax Press (Tucson, AZ), and Word Press (Kawasaki, Tama-ku, Japan). As a part of the
screen fold series, it is Primal Format Screenfold Number Five.&quot;
