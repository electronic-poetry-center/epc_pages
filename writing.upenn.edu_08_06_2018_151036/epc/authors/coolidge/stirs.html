&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ex Libris Prospero

<p>Make all from a string of puzzlements 
<br>the hum of your needs, a thread 
<br>none of these persons are hopeful but bejeweled 
<br>harmful but neat in plan and doze to the limit 
<br>of solaces to have not, this is one ball 
<br>of the pending matters, entrance

<p>Made of aim, part to steer, to stow be sure 
<br>enablement bends in air, the wall against ourselves 
<br>fell not at all at the hospital's whistle, which grasp 
<br>a bend for your cares and pipe hearts, much as 
<br>hours come true haps astride the blast, go 
<br>and speech itself the ground that runs us

<p>Rings it, I see lights that make up more 
<br>of a block here than night, corybantic nods? 
<br>selvers many, the cause is rather a power 
<br>not the pause between skips 
<br>of a lunging helpmeet brought waffling to the veer 
<br>a Typhon over there keeps our year

<p>Blown on and through, which room tends the winds? 
<br>you know not as hell so haul in appliance, a testing 
<br>of the wins to see which dares, a spine to up and flee 
<br>as hell is connective, connection all near and spells by 
<br>so I draw myself a finding sheet, wintry

<p>What name the sea in its silence of color 
<br>I work to hear such present peace, I burst 
<br>I bow into the room, ride down into styles of silence 
<br>I could haul down silence, impress the peace in core 
<br>of putty chance authority, a sovereignty serviceable as dull 
<br>it winds and my talk and I stay it all so long 
<br>the plumb tongue will not twist 
<br>shift, though it's bound to

<p>Such a plucked assembly is this? 
<br>the breathing of things will always have you down 
<br>give me a bally slot through which to run things 
<br>wash, then tuck smile as if there's the place 
<br>where I tend and hiss the matutinal gabardines

<p>Here on this landing the transparent tree 
<br>is a door to many trees, as this is seen 
<br>will this be where we live now on to teem? 
<br>be this howling advantage most perfect hoop of 
<br>my brain as leaky as a nutshell and as barring 
<br>the placing of least drowned oral men, are there others? 
<br>women to be near so now we split, the hand then opened

<p>The sky is full of sills, beaks then careless aclog with furlongs 
<br>turn a barren back to the loose stuck seas, holding of widening fears 
<br>must the stern song of a cold bird be up? 
<br>the time must be merely, the split against where lies 
<br>the map browned in bowsprit where the sprung limb launches 
<br>the dryness it is that maps me, the throning grids of brain 
<br>scald, peer, hold split ground when the surest lie 
<br>tend then leave them, the will's done

<p>Grounded hates, as she does a bird that walks, then shies 
<br>down racing tongues, the clarity of a looseness enables 
<br>a heart in its knock to final pieces, labels thus turned 
<br>to the everly more done at the double to pour at its mounting 
<br>the earth has come freighted, none to bar our fright 
<br>fire pole to parallel god of stance 
<br>put woe's own harm to it, splits tapping at one stone's pitch 
<br>my marker down to the pray collected

<p>Aftermath overtops, we only deal in results ramify 
<br>not at the count of act, now take home a tablet of furry war 
<br>your peck, the hard though filmy habit stays then stays 
<br>let's start, the mark is at the meet with doubt, straight loss 
<br>a particle of no mating, stop at the owl of the circle 
<br>ovum of the date, it's cold where we stand down and clear 
<br>I see the date then it's lost, the clown in the plural blurs 
<br>planet grown shore from its blows

<p>This stone is my mood at noon in point of chamber 
<br>woken to time's fool's wobbles, wide as a ladder to the hand 
<br>the brain of the lungs, the too heavy nail to ray slides beyond 
<br>there is no such metal forever outside the brain 
<br>and here where it comes we are, the sea mounting to its fire 
<br>the ashes brought to their stones out 
<br>persons only crowded to their handles

<p>That the cheek of its scent is sweeted, roundly planked 
<br>crowned to the prong, we're moored with the men named zinc 
<br>gone ashcarts in the dew, villanelles of avoided subsequence 
<br>cough dust whose apple stays to the one cell viable, my cell enterable 
<br>in a bell lean list of closed places, erasable centers 
<br>where I stand all that lands to a thought but meddles

<p>It's the flyaway tear of this sheet that perturbs 
<br>or had you not seen the rocket that happened? 
<br>the sea within the earth that got vented, away boats 
<br>sit and wink as may be, hours among cells to pay 
<br>remembrance is slatted and set, none may pay it pass 
<br>hour's come the loaf dropped into the arms, be you out or no 
<br>I fear there's no standing beyond anything, robust beard that you are

<p>Must all those dreams still live on my mind?
<br>is it dark behind the pass of time? or stranded as
<br>the play of fish, the mist of universal heaves, turns
<br>to listen, you'd best though asink, then caved the keg
<br>in my trunk for all the samey sentences I trash
<br>escape so long it trills to even be, help bleed
<br>what is the position of time on flooded ground
<br>though it marry itself twist and bond about, replant
<br>instead of roofing wheels the skies in shred to last
<br>so I may be, you may time me

<p>Pray what's the substitution there? inkwells flaming in again
<br>hover it to strain my lines, nothing so bold it lacks   drinking in 
<br>to topple the towers there's no screen behind, no totaling bid 
<br>to hiss him back that tarries with scoured funds 
<br>let's dry no payment of ignoble scraping, the only of it 
<br>most is the rock of the pen on matter, wing by screw 
<br>score and bend and fix a comet to his crown who deals 
<br>condition in its fineness a buckleload of books 
<br>braced and sculpted, fired from each its sounded well 
<br>I turn to spell you back so don my enemy suit 
<br>will burst amount to absolute discharge, brightly final

<p>The world's the room and the none that knew it 
<br>file by throaty in toddled hymn, abridge these chairs 
<br>the final sea is due the rubbage on your cast of hue 
<br>robed or knifeless scored to the tone of cables baring 
<br>this to tap the nascent heights of a strontium 
<br>called barium by bears, run down by seals, starving 
<br>in laced hookery and mock trepan, iridium 
<br>I knew not, pelican never, rage of dumb on high 
<br>a case of ends in premise, lock envy on repeat 
<br>mocked as the one brother by his falser mind

<p>These waved wings so prick the rats will sigh 
<br>it's a month of loving lack put wrong to trouble 
<br>the loam and the deck of the furl and hide of that 
<br>all keeps a burden bellied, the sea to drop in ash 
<br>to our devises? bugger the sign, rooms are furnished with books 
<br>see you? sea to arise in your stomach if you loan your skeleton 
<br>prow to the weeds of masterless providence, harbor of the hours 
<br>would the visages of that night prate a time, the price 
<br>the accidental star, acme sapphire to raise this sea

<p>Might be it's made of purple mischief this staff
<br>ability rays around your treacle, wind welcome, mass of my hoping
<br>and blades will dull as your spirit bade you, told to a tree 
<br>then high and been weighed the vorpal paid then zazzed out, remount 
<br>the sack to your twaddle I ready now for you 
<br>for all the good its coming does

<p>Task is I'd bid those any of the pack clouds to curl 
<br>toil, that's the mask kept hollering back and built boardways 
<br>might hap I can fly yards milk by mast by placky care 
<br>the joining of meats was there, sell mine and then sue you 
<br>the cause is in the moving, carcass for afternoon and the puzzle fled 
<br>before I incline to flame directly, cod of my handsome flake you 
<br>fire in the cracks through your hair

<p>There's muscle there, at the waist where yards of burn do meet 
<br>and the cod-dancer answers arrows, brave and fond as true coil 
<br>just the thought to leap upon my garments, yardarms spread 
<br>and not a hair was touched, cap gown and lanced parsers 
<br>retort'll be caught in my main tree, the leveler of answerhood 
<br>that and a raygun map of paradise, sure and unmemorized

<p>Haggle for a close snatch of this north shore area too, middle wave 
<br>the air of such sighs now kept in my lamp, my aim so poor 
<br>to play know-arms with part away averages up to brought himself sitting 
<br>with sighs also, stub foot with a math note, a combuster 
<br>let's take down and listen to what ships

<p>And sun all stowed to sleep beneath their catches
<br>I have no more memory of a year
<br>then a vein of snow in the marrying, time of covetry
<br>warms and boils and gives answer arms, tug at the cooling of this isle
<br>your neighbor my answer, rest your feet, able stuck sass
<br>I candled up my hill of vexness, arbor twitch it and tell
<br>they mayhaps join the capes with ropes all in antlers
<br>ivory of the iron keeps the bell, a bound additional wonder
<br>chaired miranda of the belted wonders

<p>How can demand? and then moody of that how toil? 
<br>more? glass must be grave, more passed than tossed 
<br>you handle garments feign a stick geology, antepenult diviner 
<br>barked the scads off my liberty, pretty mistaken erasure of toils 
<br>make tails and trail me true year all positional loss 
<br>ooze deeper than salt loss and she just does fret 
<br>to enable and forget

<p>She does run a sharp sword across the north deeps 
<br>does a hill's business in baked veins, marled heels 
<br>but this here tangle the hoop that lies, the bitter drooping cue 
<br>cage of your dogs, mistaken hearing bunkum to clean clocks? 
<br>miles dull at your hake, Mulligan walker and straw killer 
<br>hast you forgot on your bearing the canticle well swooned? 
<br>for one thing true is that this is not truth 
<br>be made bare and wait for it

<p>Maybe one that the sizzlers shake on, styles that go pale 
<br>the closer to the hill's woven cells, far in the broken keen 
<br>avail you, hide where it all waits, pile in dull van 
<br>nohap it still rolls, buries but moves hoist in a bowl's lap 
<br>I had that half answer, botherer, came down a few 
<br>or ring them so to, had to earthly command her pod-hunting nest 
<br>then years in wheels, whatever her servant can and in spite 
<br>of the whack and smile of double rules, helped silver and grates 
<br>I'll remain in turn to groan this island as the miller strikes 
<br>as a con man to define last laps

<p>There be three keys to the cabin, one of fur 
<br>one of the labile densities and one in case, do you dig? 
<br>someone makes of pine and lets it out, the flash invisible mine 
<br>you slept in vanishing hash away, the dream out of doors 
<br>the seldom wait nodding in veils and standard to the construct 
<br>earthly feels go bidding no matter an ocean and its coals so 
<br>what to say what shall I do to grace the stamp of an eyeball shape 
<br>it's well to go through encased in cap and belly larder 
<br>start increasing loud and make the pelt of story's weight lag true 
<br>some kinds in this yield to the shake

<p>A bucket of prime and brim with me 
<br>lest sand cap its former beauty send on 
<br>no truck with the failure of its answering mates 
<br>a tongue of the thundering face set back, a lump 
<br>interiority to spare and rave the sent palaver show 
<br>must get that kneecap brushed, spend in wades 
<br>and term a farm awash an end, no prattle furthers 
<br>a tortoise, when?

<p>A time of comedy, turn and it prospers 
<br>the compass activity of monkeys in a cemetery
<br>a blow then a matter of whether you marry
<br>the brain to come to, the average in a hurry
<br>you brawl until you bury the shoe, Palooka

<p>Stand here, foolish as a placement in rock
<br>the air hammer you keep from me, it papers masses
<br>enables the lands as peopled else, neither is
<br>either of the other's own, the more taught the less light on you
<br>more would be done, superior in sand, mount a rake
<br>and pray the sun more capable of ill, still as each hour's capable
<br>daily mounted in rock, the center of each sun, the more the moon
<br>the rest is creature, one's own meaning the steepest pain made through
<br>and taken in the mask, direct brute report of broke dark thing
<br>its aviary waves as purposed as words be made

<p>Directly dull and in simple pull the edge on any match for all that 
<br>tempts with ability curses, the seeds of cramps, larval natures 
<br>come fiery surety long and spent confined to the level subjects 
<br>where is duress? the miles of profit beyond any farm 
<br>support a shot of the diurnal service pressed beyond units 
<br>then learn me that and leave it, the hook's to other businesses 
<br>aches to color in my bone's own dimness coming

<p>A veritable seed caravan, power slave my man 
<br>he put that yellow in the ceiling so that hands will handle sands the better
<br>preemptive cutter strikes, then will it sweet the plan enforce 
<br>chambers of the strutting strain enabled to earth or its airy centers 
<br>best to charge, neighbor shine or kick the latch, the cause 
<br>waters of to follow then I'm gone 
<br>and the lands thereof will draw to

<p>The air that it begins, the seldom in which to settle 
<br>bell then gone prime down lest nothing begins it all again 
<br>my head's in the answer the heart is all question, following able 
<br>waiting on the music of time's construe, a mastered sole wrack 
<br>bitter in leaves from all those shoes avoiding skates and tuck inch
<br>a dual role to savor, sweet as rather and as sort
<br>a prescriptive shelter bet I thought would hold the match 
<br>but is gone, the head held up and nothing moving

<p>The balcony to air this beyond intention, variegated livid 
<br>darned to saddle that that middle to its median lies 
<br>nothing to be made of such eyes, sponge effect of future levels 
<br>interment bends so watch it kid the dial to a spy charge 
<br>nothing but will trade on a late change, a strafing note 
<br>so wide it windows and villages let below exchanged ocean 
<br>its elements cut with rope, bell division and crested dives 
<br>one over from the sterling sun or meddle pan or duty hole 
<br>we fell within all fright once capped yet corsetted 
<br>down, enough will rise to catch your pride and have it 
<br>a neighborly strangeness of the eyes to hide

<p>Nor no one sound was sung to be made 
<br>we lived all that night so much more to be said 
<br>a limpness sharpens in dreary happens, these dreadful dressers 
<br>salt so many ants to that mile hill, his sweater swallowers 
<br>they are evenings, those spent hollows of aim and skirt distress 
<br>a novel to be opened and met with light, melt, shake true 
<br>free novelty belie its barriers though stable so near them 
<br>then shades will show, lumpy in effect most familiars 
<br>live on lozenge though they call it stew, make away

<p>So to be made about, they come it goes on, advances 
<br>harbor the fringed senses, host partitions of something stained 
<br>of which circling the very language is made, and made about, on loan 
<br>the curvature a simple, lay knowledge of an endless stowing 
<br>not so simple as that prayer it remain, the struck divulged 
<br>answer again an arrow volute against sadness rapt 
<br>a freeness of the primes gels not till the freshest remains 
<br>do tell, then veer from whatever void the more

<p>These gain hot perfections, know such numbers lost to pronounce? 
<br>a gallant hand pay in? stumble up to bear what must remain 
<br>there are numbers of things, elephant lands of glare and plot 
<br>it's gone off under, gone on bounder again and told escapes at speed 
<br>you mind relating in temporary gifts the goal that hems and such 
<br>be spread in a tuck for, vespers alarm in trunks that stick 
<br>the latch, so spends it well this hitch you take in junior time? 
<br>it snaps me, and so in broken speaking shall, a novelty 
<br>and novel so to pour it through

<p>I see a redness where in air should be a softness 
<br>one single thing too long that it be wondered at so 
<br>somewhat over the neckbone and blown then on a long peer 
<br>and gone, it's done that once I led to the tune 
<br>the knowledge of never in beheld control, cumbersome that 
<br>to map the whole rapt route of one's throat, whatever 
<br>rate or stage of habit, no more than 
<br>in the first sight of a word one's powers 
<br>too light and one is charged with the matters 
<br>the close of a race of solace with spoken holes

<p>Spaced as a mess upon the shores of your eye 
<br>I think I thought I heard you smile 
<br>so comfortable in sorrows you are their master? 
<br>this the millions wish, to wind up watching the wit of another strike 
<br>will not give in or up, one, or tell what enters speech 
<br>enough that it is what the true liar spent, rock as a cog 
<br>in its burial wall of this isle that once was a desert 
<br>all a matter of knocking

<p>Then when someone named Doctor Wood comes we'll all slow down 
<br>let's be temporal, forget the delivery, forked off the map 
<br>is nothing to be real? a light goes on, the island again a desert 
<br>leans in like air and learnedly, who's stolen a watch on such compasses? 
<br>apply salt compresses who would not breathe through rotten lungs 
<br>rather poll the winds than snap at half the advantages 
<br>swollen I peered but full or no there's little knowledge in it 
<br>leave the road totally, the truth entirely then snap

<p>Whose heart is full of harp, that kind of miracle 
<br>with bends you must avoid and turns you make to cap the illness 
<br>of an easiness its overtures have pockets hold temporal chairs 
<br>his chin on the vine, who would ask him that in faith 
<br>nothing impossible is miraculous in due time, does it clear? 
<br>apples in the beveled island home, make a pair and I'll carry you 
<br>keep your pain from the very sowing of it 
<br>house walls and house well in good issue, be meant forth 
<br>not in cram but in being against, the number's up, <i>that</i> fresh 
<br>but any like spoken for now is closeted, would I had 
<br>rubbed it hard for sense

<p>Heard that nothing, whatever might be said to mind someone 
<br>vested each in turn to your keeping, held the water and main 
<br>slammed combed slatted and keen whole hauled it 
<br>a raisin to its own music might be shot a higher lick 
<br>bold though bowed to the shore that sent thee, sorry 
<br>made up a couple but they could largely stand, hooked 
<br>sanded throttled and kept that which orders it true 
<br>no doubt is gone

<p>Hang the forest throat for it to soothe you? may bear 
<br>on what interim volt skies off the rifling of tatters to tune 
<br>firm in the inviting though gone fluid to ground, loosely styled 
<br>and brinked abrupt each pulpit step, a short in the head remember 
<br>it keeps its own orders? please to map the staff of all 
<br>the ores in each its landings sprung to hand to hang the mind 
<br>a heavier mirror to every end needs the multiplication to quell it 
<br>I hold marriage in team though it winters not well

<p>Doing the conspiracy number, is that far from draining keyboards? 
<br>unheld and during, this absorbs you into plaster radiation 
<br>that the tried is blamed for, you're under wave banishment? 
<br>I'll have a higher way than your window, blunt striker then 
<br>are added up avenues off-sense? bulk kept hitting you 
<br>flung in the belt in the head bells of all able answers 
<br>would have to bring a cake of off for you, branch stashers 
<br>this is alluvial this call, one rubbing of the plaster of sores into waves 
<br>this raising of an island very foul

<p>And sore imagined, place to fly from 
<br>take the enabled cave or similar parasol cell 
<br>son of Arabia the Production Man, his give-away lariat to start 
<br>the inevitable stalling, pocket mat by leash cast, dark to have it 
<br>a middle of the midnight old cash nag is darning from 
<br>the china of stewbell and wheatraise decked a whole London of farms 
<br>passed by the fault's own plaster choreography, Lard Dentista 
<br>dropped a couple carnivals anyway

<p>Are you enjoying something? everything, my joker, comes 
<br>from the mouth, in perfection of the eating at nothing 
<br>we oil our cares, who does or is laughed at, would 
<br>you bring among your subjects a sun? not a need? 
<br>another whole grain quiver of questions vented, but 
<br>then nothing marks this talk for who could spell it?

<p>Mixing it up for a sun extinguisher, are you so
<br>natural and alarming, poisoned by the perfections and high to 
<br>the north of all abundance, slammed in blame of all innocence 
<br>the rostrum is endless, the voting booth dim 
<br>so how can we care beyond the latest averages, would you rather be 
<br>left on the sun, a product of the moon's engines and brain dry somehow? 
<br>not such as a nipple on the lung to laugh at, accident calling 
<br>nimble reeds of relax and plot the marry continuance of the fooling 
<br>a long flat thing, had vulcanized the moon in its spheres 
<br>change about the change driven

<p>Was that it and was I soon asleep at it? sleep's an adventure 
<br>soon shut up in the thoughts, the eyes' closed reprise 
<br>and no account debate, you'll lose it, all, as inclined to be safe 
<br>the drowse takes down, the achen burnish of plowed adare 
<br>will rate the quality of it one, and then again at Turkish velocities 
<br>the climate dries, all such optical sinks and once again brims them 
<br>but my sleep is not so disposed

<p>Have you heard it said, did you hear me speak? 
<br>soon so to do my habit is to flow, brained to make 
<br>a waking strong drop, you'd swear there's meaning in this rattle 
<br>overborn in a wind row as standing water, I'll show you its repose 
<br>matters whileways, double ebbed minewheel or so its claim 
<br>a bucket of such and then drown its embers 
<br>we swear by placements of the broken wink

<p>Get it nodded laid on in the morning, sun pump 
<br>hung to the spring with that final G, even spattered 
<br>with weakness in tune and off a mile from care 
<br>a sort of chalky porcelain lean toward memory in spigot 
<br>that's the ticket, but only this button cheek's alive 
<br>beyond life at such a nimble rate that he's gone

<p>And on in wash pants, hat rack in spares, a gum of no identity 
<br>how to sharpen a space above every cry, the wall birds and where 
<br>I go but this moon's too slow, aching for an opening 
<br>gate to an act in which what's past is proof is a rating space 
<br>a tongue in every cubit, how come he rules and then he sleeps? 
<br>see that? from whom what and broke and just slowed everything 
<br>as if in a sleep to bore understanding

<p>In such woods I'd be content with hot wax 
<br>said need for a mind that would do 
<br>mines a few horse operas in scumbled black crying space 
<br>an onyx for my vest, don't you advance? the highway 
<br>is for gamblers won't you tender me a context 
<br>bare of that? an offload and paid by your sense 
<br>a cement of the load minds, erasers and their coppers 
<br>defilement of the garments more set than before  
<br>stow such feats as have befallen you brother my man

<p>It's an hour of night up to milk the clock the cat says 
<br>modesty in eyes of sleet are drawn then depart 
<br>did we make out what pieces, the liars are going three inks further 
<br>as ever, the candied lie's a horror of obedience and flair 
<br>the earth of norm lays to, opens to the bed bow in behavioral glances 
<br>little drinks of peat in rows where open farms and diamonds 
<br>jack, unlatch your package and stay now you know what's in it 
<br>Pycopay wasn't it? that bleary tag beneath the beckon stone

<p>We're just up the hill here, nearby they call it, abide by 
<br>hand the one word tribute, cake of my preservation foresees 
<br>ghastly then dies, or reaches up to where matter is drawn from and 
<br>then he dies, thought laughable to the master of the castle of danger 
<br>all slanted in his dry haps, shake off the plumb bob humming 
<br>then fear nothing, pending is the nothing this noise tried to open

<p>Are you sure you heard it roar? it's an each that not 
<br>quite matches, a courseless place of opening weapons 
<br>started here then searched the beasts to there, canny weather 
<br>the where the sleep of the sun dog waits on high reef and chattery 
<br>a melt's foot dare the nothing to go on or to seek, but mine 
<br>eyes in their padded shade did

<p>Avuncular this that heard you, a card outpaid 
<br>as if the paint house of this lore hoisted loose 
<br>imitation firebrands are coming, drawls hasty by the inch 
<br>and to reach, I rehearse the noise of wood that it settle me 
<br>but there are sneaks wear no stones yet the sun sucks 
<br>the stones flat in team and in mist meat curse 
<br>I'll pitch but you must tumble to these apes that may bite 
<br>no matter the must of your fiery wish, no spirits to hear me 
<br>no tubas slung in treetrunks, these woods are houseless 
<br>are they not leather in their truck and lent to a centipede standing 
<br>I make the aim but similar all I add I must wind to madness

<p>I don't sweat a hair but must hang on here numberless 
<br>liaress avoid my pailfuls, a featureless world one should think about? 
<br>an awful without which no sliver of a man, wrong bells 
<br>lamed in the hallway waiting on a spot of water smart by share 
<br>a misery gathered in trance doesn't it name the storm 
<br>or at least the bed its under

<p>Shiny man strange play unable beast but chosen one 
<br>to glow on and subsidize an undertow now loose enough to sing of my shoe 
<br>or its chair, its wed to a holiday deadness, these fish have ears 
<br>if no toes to rattle under then shed yonder by huge glasses 
<br>arm the waters to warm them, abscond with a pump for the clouds 
<br>the Indians have been given and now there are no drugs left

<p>Strange web of folding functional, ferry wheel there's no charity 
<br>only remnants of the ocular itching song, pitch it up down or go hang 
<br>a man with no ground a million legs will not do him 
<br>spell it to the devil here in relative tongues, relieve 
<br>yourself in shears, is there a language for our age? 
<br>stop looking and fly apart, we'll hold the wool until you strand us

<p>Couples of torment, where be your phallic hatch? 
<br>I'll build further faster, moon at the aim of my standpoint 
<br>are you larger there in seep fields and thundershutter? 
<br>wonder if the taste of my bottle would fit his 
<br>it's all a removing task, this marble of the hate men 
<br>larval entry to a monstral cover bath, come in later 
<br>and save, your chaps will gape, send fractured speech to 
<br>the bottle fixture accompanying skull

<p>That way the battle over the nebula, this the mouth from which to spoon 
<br>backward speeches, the moon over the wall, the skin on his window 
<br>elbow shrimp I must care to take in some other mouth 
<br>the one to the north on the hill that rises, those northern hateways 
<br>it'd be pressing of the devil to snap back bent, a liver 
<br>you hear? it's best not to fear what trickles from the hollows 
<br>though there blazon your key mottos

<p>Bubble, and then blow to escape the siege of legs 
<br>the smell of some bugs to plague me at their essence feet 
<br>milled to a pith, were we not all drowned in gabardine? 
<br>to his lights the moon itself oversmokes, the lists of sailors 
<br>from a twisted bark and the brains of the gods sent 
<br>no celestial tickers, we're huddled here in monkey drag 
<br>round the coastals in grasses read the pachyderm news 
<br>and wait on our stomachs' own turns, it's ratio finding 
<br>and if you haven't squared the art of life you have not lived 
<br>in the penetrant wastes where the death is constant 
<br>that brightened word among the roasted words

<p>Must I fling this bottle back to shore? 
<br>or must I tame it back to? I would fly at this slap 
<br>make much mission of these slipping hands afleck with sharpest torque 
<br>the liquor does it save you earthly? my cellar is but a rock 
<br>where my kinds and those of dither others slam and same 
<br>have you a whole moon dropped from nether taste? 
<br>collision I assume there where it doesn't

<p>Come swear over the contents of this book once kissed 
<br>and give me chance of the lair, that I do the most good 
<br>in the poorest light, afraid of the very island to stand 
<br>and find me a further moral monster snoozed to rob, wrap in haste 
<br>collapse the bug-out lights, stick yourself to shadows 
<br>roll weak-kneed credulous, you must prime the moon 
<br>drink from the foot of

<p>But this glass in hand is acid kind, do you drain not agree? 
<br>I'll drown my nails over these crabs grown wild with pigs 
<br>no alarm scabs loose from the rock for our mothers 
<br>all were divers and sank like settled roundrock vials in rows 
<br>a planet of neatsfoot vows, rose pod by tritium fountain 
<br>make like the plummetry of all our candled company 
<br>but the howling one will hear us here, we better slow 
<br>lead fish to fire the freedom of this day

<p>Laid out alembic in a grunt lap of symmetries, stay
<br>we are mantled here and the stocks come out and I must load
<br>or rollicking pill dodgers assume the whole
<br>the pile that burns wastes our day, redoubled through fresh returns
<br>such moves are ever airy, each novel of a pack to be doubted
<br>or we remain in a sun of the same set awaiting proof
<br>the world is broken down behind the stuff in raise received
<br>a bed stead, a broken coral well, three nodules for the use of worms
<br>it's savage perhaps but stable, you gaze warily on it
<br>globule where the precious creature ends

<p>Here there's time for a world, pull the pin 
<br>most regarded of several harmonies, a puddle stitcher 
<br>master of health bondage, is there a carrier beyond? 
<br>striken this calcium then wrapped in its foil, no defect 
<br>perfect put as if to the other you, the one removing 
<br>my own sex from the glass, room from the drill of arrow 
<br>this place a graft of healthless jewel dearness 
<br>whose image is but another form of shape? be set 
<br>to call that one a friend who stocks the moon

<p>A wind came waving, wooden drawn and set to
<br>the flesh blown loose from the mouth, an answer barely 
<br>the trod-upon sake to instantly suffer any longer thing 
<br>with the patience to reside just this in condition of soleness 
<br>nothing less sound beyond hollow cased in stall 
<br>for the head is left behind drafts when it sleeps 
<br>at rim of invert mischief taken clothing long to cloud 
<br>a fool world base enough to firm no answer

<p>All matter is encounter, I must escape to keep in kind 
<br>this rarety breed of a rain grace in sprained elastic marry 
<br>an offer of a bigger trifle set to the staring between them 
<br>cunning, isn't? hence till I'm bigger and the bulk 
<br>made plain so it shows on my thighs and knees 
<br>to die of this seeking to hide the more it does

<p>A plenary endowment of itching asperity, the local 
<br>welded in its view to the heart of, the mention to 
<br>let's not skin a minute, when you find my hand 
<br>my heart will be in it on a limb with the sentiments 
<br>from addled bondage to the freedom of a hundred thousand bubbles 
<br>thrown as if gold against your facial hoard 
<br>to phrase but nothing zip up your aim 
<br>then to stop my book

<p>I'll drop then serve up the monster in my head 
<br>it's made to be a gnawing you must hear, plangent 
<br>blender grown well by our casement, yellow in hold 
<br>what else could be brave, at the last I will drown my light 
<br>will straight to neither holden care nor nod in my sack 
<br>it's late and I will ail, the leagues of my ignorance a stricken standard 
<br>now go lie, not interrupt my spell with gold

<p>And have your pick of sand fish with hairs 
<br>batrachian in sediment and pelt with piles irradiate 
<br>the mereness buckles and sandwiches invention with type 
<br>of a case destroy your dark and up the hill of shoes to tear 
<br>involves a sound to stir, months till the next tree 
<br>please you, I repeat it all I kneel in bass drone of echoes 
<br>a bath mate of the suited monster's

<p>You can't lie to my thing here, crest and dance 
<br>a louting rock will cancel, destroy all sourceless monkeys 
<br>will you be pierced or kept by the in-glow 
<br>case of such cunning haunts, teeth below your windows 
<br>where it'll dare to come in at you, on 
<br>is the same, eldritch reach to 
<br>the plotted where the thing dare not

<p>I imitated the island most certain, shed 
<br>in favor of the yield asleep, the tension put 
<br>as clapped out through his ear most freshly paid 
<br>I assume you dropped it back, faded friend at the hinges 
<br>more shown this patch that blows is gone, further 
<br>the bottle let by nail cannot stalemate its freshness, clatter 
<br>and rate, a mile above which all wits forsook, a player 
<br>cancelled or balanced, I can't relay which

<p>I do not make up such a drink with fingers 
<br>it comes in at or not pretty beats of another time 
<br>his mother his father there the mutilation night withheld 
<br>to settle enough as is, then his water took some further stock 
<br>where land or not a greatness filled the edge 
<br>so to give of all the lie some further time 
<br>apology stands further off plumping

<p>But this brain to the inners of his skull must stick 
<br>a craning loose to temper it, not, little is the pause for innard 
<br>slot in which the root grew clenched, his codes to take out 
<br>with a knife will move to startle at the edge, largen day 
<br>the disfunction of a liver brood bedevils the utensils 
<br>but his so-called books he calls them volumes in skull space 
<br>hat rack for the vizier, customary dizziness to drown 
<br>the man comes up varlet, his greatest least to be doing 
<br>hand over head in a haze to recover the depths

<p>But I drink back spread and flout am full of monster 
<br>scraping in the night ways sully a burn I call books that 
<br>do hate me they're callous to unload, too tall to duck the sun 
<br>when I'm thus full I'll give my hand to sleep 
<br>off this tongue to beat in my head, does anatomy 
<br>make you merry?

<p>After made length this is the last game to catch 
<br>jugged post tussle, full parrot to show yourself like 
<br>a tablet at the beaching of nobody, dying to play no one 
<br>this stone signed by the picture of not a thing, get a bed 
<br>I'll keep no razors hovering, sleep blown from a string 
<br>the mountains of dreams show riches as I'd woken on a cry 
<br>the drops began to cloud, I longed for voices to reopen my wounds 
<br>instrumental showing through the musical for nothing 
<br>quick fixture of moss upon the honeys

<p>I will long hum the story of a sound sleep, stir you 
<br>the makings of its laying to lead after 
<br>slowness has trod these near bones to a maze 
<br>is mocked in proportion, rested in the quest for flatter liquids 
<br>but see how dull these seamonks attach 
<br>the bone to the ache precise, a liver to twitch from 
<br>brain pressed to a further thirst, wear to whack 
<br>the very privates of vigilance stay not so fresh 
<br>matters to the math shape of my brothers

<p>Tree way in the door slope made grain its guarded sweetness 
<br>last, about it one candle to credit our belief, your cast 
<br>clogged humans of the monstrous gentle, assuming people ray shape 
<br>ponder wreck as their manners slant I'll come to both bottles 
<br>note the shape in its infancy long from tangles trots the space 
<br>makes hair of which you will find the worse 
<br>rising from fire mates with a sounding muse

<p>But to this taste sent airs braid no tongue 
<br>where are their breasts, their heads stand out of their flesh? 
<br>whose hamster gains the stars then regains its habits 
<br>I care not a hang to which to bring you, though it be my last 
<br>the pristine vanishes, then the hollow marble sea revolves 
<br>made mad to so sling down, scratch up a fool then 
<br>in half flood an instrumental fit to your life 
<br>a drowning from what belched up then lowers, from the sound 
<br>I'd think Aladdin had coursed the bride of a madness

<p>Then there are oval deals closed over your tables 
<br>a starting well of sword long drifts to the play of entry 
<br>not but diminishing stabs so found interminable 
<br>remember the uplift exposure, the nerves still to close 
<br>the strength to click, I give you powers 
<br>to the death in priceless drops, tongue over margins 
<br>answers to the wheel, draw up and top the sea 
<br>make stumbles quit the sands, shore lakes and creeks encumber 
<br>a barrel all of ropes repose, I renumber your strengths 
<br>straight upon your heads in nothing but falls

<p>Cold is this grace at nothing done 
<br>had the object fit distracts my charms 
<br>so prodded the life entirely up banisters 
<br>down rows of the knit up and sundry the caliper snares 
<br>avaunt the chimney, I love to suppose and match what's dawning 
<br>though so far in stare, do you hold?

<p>Though drowned in when spoke my charms click higher 
<br>bedded in a simple deep so prime and touched on end 
<br>there are areas storm the last of till be tuned to 
<br>latch the pipe, renew the ooze to deeply plummet 
<br>gold has the sound of that which lies mudded 
<br>and we all go crazy later

<p>This spare gulf where not but a prism matters 
<br>lifts us from the poisons in great time, its chock halls 
<br>its racks and centrum pairing freeze to a bounty restless 
<br>this spirit is desperate and dials over dials to a dulcet

<p>Mystic topical Onan blistered straight from the magpie pens 
<br>this is not of, but an autonomous punishment mode 
<br>yodled for you, inimitable bleaters of your own hands 
<br>empassioned in ash house you trill loose then catch again 
<br>I'll forgive not a third of your trials, lapse as may be staunch 
<br>let go the lariat and cringe, here I stand by height and treddle 
<br>vexed, that all will be made to halt behind the one I fear
<br>stands out, the deep bleak knots grow terrible 
<br>and not take lostness as a gift

<p>But when I crawl to bed I let fall the lamps 
<br>my April which is not a month but slung off barrens 
<br>coiled in a cup to complete the oracle, a sunday 
<br>in the space of no date, this time, collars are buried in the union 
<br>of weeds lit might stay latch out wide on the brim, dodderer's brink 
<br>the heed you take before the heaves let fall these gaining drinkers 
<br>that heed the words of mutterers at the scrounger's pale tic

<p>Have you noticed? silence is longer at each end 
<br>a fairer drop of strain than the mistral's noises? bunko 
<br>to come the worst to opportunity's ledges, a farm on the turn 
<br>blows free and on, to be divided later as seed palaver and until 
<br>the baiting of the ender at an edge of day be solved 
<br>hurumph over peas to a completeness daily nods avoid 
<br>let's celebrate the chains beneath our founding favors 
<br>ducktail of a night's lodging, the spokes come free and peering 
<br>I'll dandle my own, take away what too soon melts to the last

<p>Could you do another trick with these capes? 
<br>do a favor thus to most potent matter, a clapper at the gate 
<br>much pretense in the lungs at the veins of art the climes of falsehood 
<br>will you remember your bony early pens? I'd hose 'em off 
<br>and come together talking with whatever air, the bubble mistook 
<br>stay off a bit, mime on vanity, a treetrunk as hitter 
<br>as can be swung and in shifty coupled mereness the right price
<br>be just the plink to expect, dark eye or a dash 
<br>but this is a cling for presently

<p>The boy there is boiling under, do you lean close enough 
<br>to dead to mean it? doxology, there will be rivers in the hall 
<br>and what the incoming may say of it, bounce looseness and hanging drain 
<br>a window vertical in the roof, we approach the docks of dread 
<br>shifting answers on our hands, through the real most rich to place 
<br>is this an atrium where romance wrestles with the find? 
<br>love it, but when the snow blows through your stain, arrest

<p>Build yourself a granite racehorse, use it to negotiate 
<br>drag stairs to a certainty, I have not known what you meant 
<br>leaving as how a broom nibbles our brims or shadows only the sponge 
<br>make a sea of what your self does arouse, penalty's keen 
<br>and we fly with our cups to all the watery arches, model kits of tongue
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stone 
<br>I am proud of my blue bow to the unshrubbed earth, portions 
<br>so lacking in horizons of scarf to decorate, or tucks arrange 
<br>we have lasted so many, dropped astray into testy plots 
<br>freshened to have on our hands, and tonight the attentions

<p>Where is the bed light, is it attached to anything 
<br>that wheel of an arm, that clutch of pillars, the hoist 
<br>drop your done torches and shoot right out, placements broken in on 
<br>all the map laid stead in the skull, my honors are marrying 
<br>do you all lurch from gardens, waltz the packs over your nebs? 
<br>I would be honored to issue and so it is with you 
<br>cornucopiad candle floss faceless in its poisons that never empty

<p>I have soul, the heat boy trod, and it is most masticated 
<br>lumping from hereafter in the art of mines, I have never 
<br>wondered as much as a wife, sweet withal to put the silence on the snap 
<br>these books are harmless-looking where the least avenue would harm 
<br>their spells, crisp the earth-leaning canon and droll, command 
<br>the greens, wind their entireties, blend with what handles may attach 
<br>light feet will come free to celebrate any contact 
<br>legal by heavy and hollowly vanish

<p>The cars most to come were never confident of their minutes 
<br>this the beast near forgot, a temptation no stronger life to avoid 
<br>by bell lap answer by crystalline ladder smasher we lift 
<br>but he bands behind, lashing in the hall blow and temperature cap 
<br>are these smallnesses to so distemper the day logy? 
<br>and half in the winds half in the hand, the doling out each from his town 
<br>we have most of the each way there, our air is so

<p>But sly our portion now is quicked, in space of blenders 
<br>as imported you blurred all mentions scad gold to the hilts 
<br>or molds of hills, guarded as melts in sound comparison 
<br>their simples raised to thins, shy a cambric wrist of tea 
<br>scored as baseless placement the hoard so globe and pouches 
<br>shown as the all great itself shall dissolve or print back whole 
<br>in gated substance, ratchet but a lean upon, no rack 
<br>someone here has stumbled to it, coupled clear as raid

<p>For we are stuff to the wheel on which our baited days 
<br>that our flighted rolls the marvel of overhaste bedazzles 
<br>a smallness of the round that it be round, its size is left behind 
<br>we deem, are left to, waiting on and nothing precedes 
<br>the troubling a silence, a turn taken on and then we're out of it 
<br>a few cells of weakness still to show and then I'll walk 
<br>just such a further mind so in its turns to beat

<p>Come to think, thin metal of such cleavage to arrive 
<br>who will prepare the flesh? come to watch, I doubt 
<br>and flute it through old chips and spare most matters 
<br>the person's dome goes off and what comes seething in 
<br>enters not so his anger won't be, hits rims and steers 
<br>inevitably hieratic in its twist and ground beat with sure nuts 
<br>it's arrived at in the kissing of the breaths as their faces shorten 
<br>bends of that project be tabled, prosaic these wreathes 
<br>and settled these weathers, I'll seal their magic in such lids

<p>Go to thievery and pool what sells above your rafter 
<br>the very ground a bending fatality in the wake of what cells 
<br>your lake up to the chin is left, let that bird's feet stink 
<br>the whole house a thievery so gotten to, throttled on 
<br>the devil is born in a stuck on it nature, the one minds lose 
<br>evening up till it all roars, the body to show up on parallel lines 
<br>it's made in halves as is known, a wet show, a paddle finery 
<br>particular and lonesome, a map of all the cankers to come

<p>But the largest blind footfall in the staring hole, why 
<br>an entrance behind a fool be thought harmless? play jacks with horsepiss 
<br>my cell will wither and tangle sprouts along its flanges and win 
<br>do you say it is better left great than played with us? and until? 
<br>even a horse would not piss near its hall, you are lost? 
<br>I speak the price onward and handle hardly at all, the chance 
<br>I wink at own fault? there's no chance to the heat of monsters 
<br>therefore fuck softly lest you lose all your rattles in the pool

<p>But my bottle is the huge one of infinite loss, carry you?
<br>not much more tell to my wetting, be it quiet at the mouth
<br>the fool born stands that none may write it by, settle on
<br>whatever thoughts may belong to my hand, the wiser by the wish
<br>grown inept belongs to trash, vapors, loose cachet, emollient stew
<br>to catch a breakdown the stuff of such luggage, make piece haulage
<br>reached such a peak the skin be filled with pinches
<br>those audible wedges

<p>Will this mash you yet another line to lose? 
<br>there's little time to level and lure of it yet an excellent prattle 
<br>the barline swerves in this humming, granted-its own castle pew backwards 
<br>yet we grate and lose time to those apes wherefrom the catch 
<br>come put said line away among the rest, take a blending firm 
<br>and shed to carry, we know no setting but the silver mountains 
<br>say those, the ones who plumb the swings of a hearty tarrying

<p>Grind, then turn to help your head on low, dapple hands 
<br>cream the storm loose of its cogged laughter that salts and shoals not 
<br>we convulse in the morning full to our sinews the nerves do plant 
<br>the arrival of cramps brings up spotted, pulled a hank of the roar 
<br>these unusual earths take some jarring to carry, wall by fillboard null 
<br>off to the zooery though I shorten, take the blinking in a tad 
<br>to the joins let us wind all sound, no sign to phase an hour's air 
<br>and we land free it whole to take in with us

<p>Most of all things that slur by without shape, we seem them then
<br>to have a project crack, obtain first the head then table it going 
<br>tip the alembic in half his task, overblown moon may teak my share 
<br>oblong wedges the galleries token, there is no carriage to this day 
<br>the one in which nothing drops or encloses finish either, hallmark 
<br>train and lose you, whenever will the small ones cease 
<br>no share at which time should drop, fashioned in bitter confines 
<br>we have at last our laughter brought out of the strain of talk 
<br>raise battles of a health in strife, the weather to rehearse your cell 
<br>I'll go hover the brim to, brains encased in beads and soft 
<br>the elegant lids engage then soak in their going

<p>This charm will only give me back my sorrow 
<br>so strongly drops to be tender, veils of self leach a touch 
<br>the faults of the day run down, are you sent such in thought 
<br>none of mine of an air but that air, be you selfless 
<br>a passion not only of the quickness is struck, be all 
<br>the more sharply whistled the more short of a drift this purpose 
<br>I hear the scratch of it down

<p>Where even the sky is chaos and we don't, when all 
<br>the evening parts are torn, the boy there is and soils 
<br>what is it and does it live clad enough to dry and shore it 
<br>in entropy, there would lie slivers of a ball, heating and other 
<br>metal elements, polls in the draft and what the encomium sags past 
<br>a steamroll to slice a hoof

<p>These are the dolls of an ingrown scene, a larger standing 
<br>dread of what starts on grounds and learns with the hands 
<br>an unoval hard of wrestles with the find, or a nearly 
<br>atrium bud sufficient to core it, state what ebbs on floats 
<br>or the hurled deals when the chase comes back, once we do fly 
<br>though the moon take no print of the foot, came back without a stir 
<br>these edges whose aid collapses terrible coinage of the true maze 
<br>it's corpseless but trying and the crows of sow blue bite 
<br>come leaping out of their highwire cars ready with the closing storms

<p>These beds though weak in tread are rimmed with suns 
<br>apothecary realms sift back and the adjusted vault strikes oak 
<br>till told in fires between the seas a green poke comes to root 
<br>and we snap and have flame and wanders jerking the tails of cumbrous 
<br>and sundry noon till this plan war, I'll take the mute point 
<br>and sit like a murmuring master and jut, rattled in bolts to the amazon seal 
<br>and clamored wet and stubbed though be called forth a sea 
<br>a marmoreal lagging after made shiver by curfew toll 
<br>then live in the stone and form it

<p>Have the ones who may measure keep watch on my skull 
<br>though only one there be who can master it 
<br>more milers will take on my senses till they break 
<br>sound and merge a total mine of charms and heeds 
<br>this senseless brisk of rough and lead emergence 
<br>coils this depth is for, a music only formed to drop 
<br>these buries as if drownings cups of shoring up do take 
<br>and light and the longer the lamps themselves do show 
<br>I'll stop the act, I'll stick this book 
<br>chalcedony over heels and belfry flies 
<br>the flagon agate of a vagrant art

<p>I am, and no sooner flies creep than dance 
<br>the whole of all that tune and slide the threading through 
<br>occluding anvil thought, I'd bury very air and skill 
<br>though notching armfuls claim our vow, a nod in a nip to potence 
<br>in a sailing lump too skim to bear, laid open till another hear 
<br>will ride down further from this low-end music, the bending of staves 
<br>the end of this night where my arrow lies 
<br>clusters shoulder a shorted nature's share

<p>I make it be seen then I stow it, lock it 
<br>down into the plenties of earth paven wallets a smell rises 
<br>as the circle is cured they enter, the ones, the moving 
<br>steels of a dark charm run in disturb of the melting senses 
<br>I have thought these risen clearer, the halts and their blends 
<br>you wave over the coast of world and heed, where home is a broth 
<br>and I seek no blood for the flesh, I want news to rise 
<br>whose cells go muddy in the thumb, there spell I

<p>More than the quick spirit is present, shown off in lacks and sends 
<br>the belly of an owl on a bat's flat back, how increase 
<br>the crinkle lies in an ease no tenement to leap from 
<br>or browse in silent earnest, they scowl through liquid blossoms 
<br>under sucking of the blouse, its radiant missing sleep under snatches 
<br>woken plants are kept, air my few, engage my raid 
<br>the dawn is inevitables invisible in a freedom from what hatches

<p>Or was it thought that beat pulse in two out of 
<br>aim the drink and return, do we reside in the twice-beaten?
<br>all trial in the doubles a maze of discernment tongue over till 
<br>the mind of such a fear is wrong in assurance, to or fro placement 
<br>the minerals hold a madness in my blood, I crave to brood 
<br>is it so wrong to be living and not swear to pluck a brace of 
<br>confidence so minded, for there's no time to the latest

<p>Or is it the fault of rank mouth, so strewn is its sod 
<br>lost the hours must restore, the rest not think 
<br>come wracked past cure are we shoved and surety cracked 
<br>the memory's no cue past this curve once twice, as you like 
<br>this stretching lack of grace? where it's put time wears 
<br>but there are weaker fears, much loss of wind to that ooze 
<br>that bares then flies stop the sound of your daughters growing scarcer

<p>It's the throne of water where words jut no further than their breath 
<br>a mop up it is of, a waddle beyond the waltzes churn your senses 
<br>is this not the landed brown of natural day loose in its onions 
<br>and strangely though its better series are welcomed as a wreck is landed 
<br>and not yet more of this to the asking which notch of this cell wish you 
<br>do you care to look again, a bargain on the ramping of all wants 
<br>the lamp's spit out, the wall is gone and I play with all my falseness
<br>inscrutable dark before the fire's remove

<p>Then are continental gems and coverings oil to all my willings 
<br>broke, the context is not faithless but another tongue to loose 
<br>the sharing of nothing breaks off and we shut, cursing the merciless causals
<br>such a wonder such a world be new, again as normalcy vaunted 
<br>her scowl bled off at such a cost the world to remembrance buckles 
<br>and stretches from such that a compass comes about in relay 
<br>the solving of the dare of a people in play at the coming of it

<p>We waste more mortal advice on a scad, it's been told 
<br>the rest is reknown, sound and restless havings, dulcimer 
<br>received a second life though stopped oddly before the mast 
<br>I reach nothing but a heavier heaven and drop the chalk 
<br>lets have us a tune of a bigness with common pillars, cranes 
<br>umbilical dash to the heart in own hands, iron ponds 
<br>stretched human of given witless, a list to be filled 
<br>a number to be filed, okayed in dust delayed

<p>What is the new if not the mouth to have, this rig 
<br>to embrace, this frogged and yearly tight of a service relapses 
<br>all such to be done since it went, are we rafts of hirelings? 
<br>capped to a trick the natural strange to think of, metal does sound 
<br>has us jump to please and no stop outside to lock up the dream 
<br>for all and good the several noises, sort of codicil liberties taken

<p>Heap it to the bridge with unbended bars, make a seldom 
<br>and on it train the loath to fly among, buy all the fruit 
<br>I can hear in my head to sling it, down for the rest and steady on 
<br>nothing to plan that it flow and ebb about as matches half 
<br>the flavor a tongue may rinse from memory risen and tangling 
<br>the two things of darkness meet the demijohn of light 
<br>it takes some having, the acknowledging down of mine

<p>Or be touched with shortness at a later half, the due 
<br>is come to light the lamps that score my bones a track to dice 
<br>or overly stirred proportions stung under lamps at the hall of eyes 
<br>they lay, each cell an island for the thrift of shifters 
<br>pardonable jugglers of the mast for the fist, the face for the mass 
<br>or from it comes double true, the grace of this dull 
<br>to fool away, steal a vein to go to

<p>So gone particular for discourse this accident of story plain 
<br>no such plans to be made quick away, enobled in surmise 
<br>of the better oxygens no aim to skip each thought my third 
<br>these shall be grave and long the hearings to be strangely thrust 
<br>I link at all, I polish the gales, the mess for partner seas 
<br>a wally gale so fleet the marble nations catch on call 
<br>to charge at a click the snarey fault drawn so free to near

<p>But little is in my having lacking your direction, scenes
<br>barers of style, shown catches and ears no rubber glares 
<br>while least teams come to strength in one's owning 
<br>a paster of lots on realms, bystander of placement, ogler 
<br>of the confidence faint, on plurals airy knolls your takes 
<br>but I, by and largeness melts my aim, let me not 
<br>in charm so big cast the spell of it bare, down its lists 
<br>wasted bonds, noise me on the skull of your hands 
<br>good opener you, project me the flames to chanted coals 
<br>the keys to please, the price nonended rites, a clamor 
<br>under the sun of a peeled disappear 
<br>the only stop to a prayer that pierces 
<br>the fault that closes, else the metals of a spirit's hell 
<br>sound indulgence when a pendulum nears 
<br>now go you to, then let me be

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- 21I92
