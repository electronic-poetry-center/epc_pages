<p>And is this the same thing?
<br>Nodded while doubting, and hauled it out into the yard.
<br>Knowledge of squirrels, minimal, standing though hoisted,
<br>spread out over a carpet of beads, close the door, squirrel.
<br>He had stepped beyond his last. And then appeared at
<br>the first. No known letters to impede his progress.
<br>Oregano, stout. Loud voices though only on album.
<br>The blood cells were repeated, as the trees the sky.
<br>No erasures, no nothing pending. Entrance through
<br>the hoarding, the penciling betrayal of stiffness.
<br>Monkeys under the limit, the ground full of dirts.
<br>Blank face, black avenue. The light rang
<br>as he lifted his hand.

<p>The crystal was white, yellow, silver, blank.
<br>Transparence a matter of slowly mattering, coming
<br>to focus under sun under thumb. You never
<br>see beyond but through. Milky, blustery,
<br>sheerly, coughs off down an oiled hallway.
<br>Anything is possible, anything is undersung. Held to
<br>be an oxide, held down under being lower. A
<br>double one that repeats its index. Carted off
<br>in chair, squirrel watching. Album bending,
<br>match unlit. We see, and its mother,
<br>the father of all hymns.

<p>Marked cards, enablements to attach comment
<br>or an elastic candle in firm disregard.
<br>Cattle car mottled with starlings, fire truck
<br>gilding out of harm's way a vote for fog.
<br>And the amphibians we will all admit to being.
<br>The crystal apparently on fire. The water
<br>immediately on tap. The light. The light. The light
<br>of its stone enclosure. She spoke, but
<br>we listened.

<p>There continues to be and has been lost, lost of
<br>literary activity around town. But words or notes
<br>or strokes or steps are not objects. But then
<br>what is one? Something that backed into, or was
<br>backed into by, the light and thus at first missed.
<br>Now everything is missed and still standing around.
<br>How can one speak from within the thought
<br>of the thing, from the standing on the floor, from
<br>the heart? Where is the source of the center?
<br>How are the dreams connected, and where and
<br>how weighty is their index? When I put it
<br>like that all out of myself I perform a useless
<br>repetition. Where bend the cards so that they may be
<br>listed in their shuffle? And how remember
<br>exactly the leanings? Washfulness connected
<br>to orange leggings.

<p>I lost the mystery novel but caught the meaning
<br>just as it was leaving. We have focussed so much
<br>on meanings we are left with maybes. And all
<br>the structures have been left up, for the view if
<br>not the hand. Perhaps the eye is beginning to leave
<br>and the ear coming into its own. Perhaps neither or
<br>both in the sense, what center of the mind between
<br>them. The object, after all, is never just
<br>red or cold. I took the mike out of the box
<br>and played awhile with <i>its</i> alphabet. That I was
<br>never out of my mind of the window. And how the
<br>car comes.

<p>Then dogs bark and the walls come true. The redness
<br>was that if text but not of wall. Two things
<br>occupying the same space of different sizes.
<br>A thing occupying two shapes. Shape Master lifted his
<br>hand from the sodden sign. Immediately thought
<br>and put away. Immediately again. Immediately thrown
<br>open to the glare and shut. The words in the cabled
<br>message shut themselves off like beads on a plate.
<br>The heads were still in bed in every frame of the Cadmium
<br>News. Heads outlined in a reddish motion.
<br>A not knowing anything by the saying. A largeness of
<br>unspoken space for the taking, for the walking out, for
<br>the wrecking after much intense building, for the openers,
<br>for the nonce and the apple.

<p>A wobble amongst three sentences. The church lived half
<br>on its own land and half by the livers of its parishioners.
<br>The walk by the way had been decided, by the waterfall
<br>and its careful placement in cups, by the hand not needed
<br>for a final allotment. The half-polluted cigars were
<br>stacked by the river drained into. And another one,
<br>a one of sod and limes and musical bracketing.
<br>The one gone.

<p>He docked by the crystal, pulled in all ropes and the book
<br>could not be read. The crystal could not be white
<br>for it was not seen. Sounds as if it was through.
<br>But never finished like the unread book, the off-center
<br>orange, the duck below.

<p>And what is the one's own death, locked as firmly as
<br>a bubble in a crystal? A darker line I had
<br>not seen before, product of facet angles, a
<br>more condensed clarity, is these questions?
<br>A question is a hand reaching. The crystal.

<ul><li><div align="center">&nbsp;</div></li></ul>

<p>But I will not have the opportunity to do that.
<br>I will not see myself later. On the average
<br>no razor blades, no fans, no opportunities for
<br>lifting the manhole and peering down within. But
<br>everything, on the order of chaos, is possible. For
<br>one, and the same me. The one out of order,
<br>by the back door, the other. He needs no opportunities
<br>for all is permitted, on the reverse side, the never
<br>to be revealed to me. What I don't know
<br>is the absolutely not to be known. I have no
<br>sister. No brother either. There is now only me
<br>and the same, the reverse, the intransigent
<br>order. Out there loose in the all. And
<br>no sense, I realize, in copying this out.
<br>Under the city lies no space for me.

<p>I keep spinning the crystal to see all sides
<br>but I can never exactly see the side that is
<br>turned away. In Japanese the haiku requires
<br>17 syllables. In my language as many more as may prove
<br>necessary. And it's a long enough might but never
<br>that long. We pass from bit to bit, and even
<br>exchange some of the bits between is. He lives
<br>three avenues down, near the blue skylight above the
<br>dirt factory. I pick up the copy of the book of
<br>Thomas Mann I will never read. I admit same
<br>to a certain one by letter. A volume of small
<br>plays of a mechanical scent. Sea mice, gills
<br>developed, under study at present. All the possibilities
<br>in a grave and at once. Certifiable commencement.
<br>Glands that produce laughter. Snails with seals.
<br>Globes of clear dust attached to the palms.
<br>Poems in a posthumous form. Follow the wake
<br>before the vessel has left the dock. Trail
<br>your hands before speech.

<ul><li><div align="center">&nbsp;</div></li></ul>

<p>Wandering the earth, up and down in it, and in
<br>its pockets the wand of stone.
<br>A stretch of reaching until it burst its chords,
<br>spill sand gems and open vaults in vapor.
<br>The name was written on the package but not on
<br>the letters. I approached the castle and
<br>kept approaching it until I had no hope of
<br>leaving it or of arriving either.
<br>The keystone was balanced on an arch of cloud.
<br>The waters lapped at the closure of any hands
<br>at all. Morning. Folding lights. Terraces
<br>as the pastime of enclosing plant forms.
<br>Statuary broad as population at the favored spot.
<br>The crystal poised to take my hand in its . . .

<p>Crystal with the life of a broken skull.
<br>Crystal with terraces for fastening cloud cracks.
<br>Crystal contain the silver of its own crack of light.
<br>Crystal raw and firm locked in air and my own plotted gaze.
<br>Crystal with no answers to my questions, the questions,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions, salts.
<br>Crystal with which to pick a rib.
<br>Crystal no novel will ever enter.
<br>Crystal with not so much as a name either.
<br>I have removed the gathered name, it did not adhere.
<br>The names were all shelved with their own shells.
<br>The names were olden, of dated character, less than radient.
<br>The names kept track of each other.
<br>Birds of a feather, capillary phrase, irradiant banter.
<br>The corpse flowed long on a bed of splendour.
<br>Color dry twig without the English u.
<br>Names are preparatory, their legends strewn.
<br>I picked up the name in an absent moment, gesture,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cabinet door with a sprung hinge.
<br>I raised the crystal, entered it in hand, locked the words
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from any thoughts to come.
<br>I scratched and raved and slept.
<br>I counted the take and found the crystal standing on the table of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss.
<br>I was engrossed and it was left.
<br>The lights to dismember, December and forget.

<ul><li><div align="center">&nbsp;</div></li></ul>

<p>This book called the unread text might not be the one
<br>the crystal reveals. The text of the crystal might
<br>reveal everything but itself. Readable as any plot
<br>that shows a hole, a hole as central to itself.
<br>The things not framed allow the mind. The crystal
<br>continues to flag thought, and thought's belief in any of the
<br>wisdoms. This book will not allow me to write
<br>beyond itself. And less than a foot away
<br>from these moving lines lies the crystal.
<br>To catch the changes of its lights I must move
<br>myself. Speed is essential matter.
<br>The writer increases to any stop.
<br>The crystal is not here.
<br>I would be no longer writer of these words.
