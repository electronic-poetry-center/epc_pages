	<blockquote>

 There is a conventional idea of poetry as a poet's personal speech, which is
 how we come to identify, however imperfectly, Robert Frost as a sly New England
 farmer, <img align=left src="solution.gif" width="150" height="235" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" alt="cover of Solution Passaget">T. S. Eliot as a mock Anglican churchman and Wallace Stevens as a
 connoisseur dandy. This is the commonplace wisdom that provokes the reader of a
 new book of poems to search for the poet's "voice" and, not finding one
 sufficiently distinctive, to say of this poet with a reviewer's judgment, "He
 hasn't found his voice yet."

 <p>But there is another model of poetry as a kind of filmlike construction, a
 montage of words or phrases taken out of the poet's head, or from newspapers or
 books or street signs, or radio programs or pieces of conversations overheard in
 the street. It is not as common a model, but there is plenty of precedent for it
 in the works of poets such as Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, William Carlos
 Williams and Louis Zukofsky, to name only Americans. Clark Coolidge has been an
 accomplished practitioner within this mode for nearly 20 years, and until fairly
 recently, nobody would have thought to identify his "voice." His poems of the
 '60s were wordscapes, sparse arrangements of single words, sometimes parts of
 words, that acted like single shots that achieved their cinematic effects
 through the variable semantic distances separating the individual word images as
 in:
 
 <blockquote>
 <p>time coal hum base
 <br>treat south admit
 <br>low the dissolve add
 <br>owl
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>which seems to end in a jump cut. By the time of "Quartz Hearts" (1978),
 Coolidge started assembling larger units, phrases, phrase groups and sentences
 in lines to form longer sequences that occasionaly seemed to produce bursts of
 apparently connected speech. But whose speech?

 <blockquote>
 <p>The sound was of note-taking, terse and elliptical:
 <br>Stopping a while. A staying power
 <br>Dots extended, coffee books. A rock
 <br>Sometimes pronouns appeared -- "I" "we" "someone."
 <br>. . . Signs seen for miles someone
 <br>figured for no reason. That we could see.
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>The work achieved a kind of reflective tone without suggesting that anyone
 in particular was reflecting on anything in particular, only that the poem was
 reflecting.

 <p>"Solution Passage" picks up from "Quartz Hearts," and most of the poems tend
 to develop a fairly consistent speaker, an "I" that lasts nearly long enough to
 govern the entire speech act of the poem -- though probably not a moment longer.
 This allows the poems to enact many of the gestures of conventional lyrics,
 especially in their openings and closings, as in "Lifelikeness," which starts:

 <blockquote>
 <p>"What makes it like this that here could stand for you"
 <br>provides section-closing cadenzas like:
 <br>"All I am has been, closed"
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>but suspends and fends off throughout its middle all the well- practiced
 banalities of the mirror poem, which it replaces with a set of intermittent
 takes and rejections in which the shifts of language between banal and fresh,
 opaque and clear, are musical maneuvers suggesting Coltrane doing ballads.
 "Solution Passage" is not a conventional book of lyric poetry. It is the work of
 an experimental master doing a set of brilliant takes on the convention.
