<p align="center">33.

<p>Come from the middle and go home. Performing women in a calabash,
<br>haste to display and all plumb. Passing along the way of seamless
<br>parlors, pastures, plates in flight. Today becomes the day

<p>his goldfish thinking stands. Among which, dial the last of the food.
<br>Fuel or its might, which? Thanks for the money, in the park, the rose
<br>stood to land. Found the count of the world in its caves, a guava

<p>would. Bombings? Two moments, just. The second takes a safe lock,
<br>street of red silk. But the term Or the world is right away.
<br>Remember that firehouse angle closed against my chimes. Drilled.

<p>An oblique light on the matter is the matter, double. Tomorrow
<br>the raisins will be making their turns. I am merely to maintain
<br>the lead here. A hopeless handle for all takers. How to find where

<p>the scent comes loose. Birds hop over anyone's brain, perhaps taking.
<br>Glass, that's how the arrow does its leveling. I have to make five
<br>or six or there might be too much food. A day. And smiled at

<p>the stolen stakes. Hear me lady? Be a taste of it yourself and
<br>lend hold of the tool. A fact of second ducks. Too much height hard
<br>to handle, decibel. Then the home street fled open. Walked himself

<p>loose from her gown. Over, that's the way of the sample, turpentine.
<br>But no takers down are known. My fingers spine. The world of food
<br>gets traded for all the rest of the worlds. Arrows to be locked

<p>if the ducks have their say. You are after all with many open lines.
<br>A battle for the handles of many takers. Then as a second light on
<br>thicker deserts. Behind which the jury rehearsed. I may say, safe

<p>and sharp. Rode at dawn at the top of a truck full of birds.
<br>The red people in those mountains. A sharp firing of light on
<br>the obliquer deserts. I opened that street with my sharper picture.

<p>Why not? It's a carved world, a blessing. Ring lock told wake.
<br>Those ducks were someone's brain. The trees once out front are
<br>in your bedroom. Lug the vacuum. It don't quite matter, that ruby

<p>of a world's scissors. Sort of how it would do to hide? Airplanes
<br>in trouble turned off at his desert, a wasted pocket tap touched
<br>again today. A three-inch plane with six aboard extremely difficult

<p>for the thicker drugs. A sickle for eleven, no better than a piercing
<br>buzz. That key emits the squatter music? Four old hands ready to roll
<br>the room in a sugar splay. The chairman of torpor wants his wings.

<p>Just like the news, every scrape that monk loves, outside of his
<br>clothes, his overlap in dew mist slice. How could we be? Car barn
<br>my sense of it is, laugh to the slaughter, holistic peels, drills.

<p>The sliding cracks that came away loose in my fire bend. The handle
<br>of my pocket. The other meant surgery. Pictures requiring radio of
<br>a teacher in a bus. Whose bird gone over the top. Whose latch.
<p>&nbsp;

<p align="center">34.

<p>Do you continue to serve the hot light? Waist in making its turns,
<br>salads, tamps. My fingers on the world's spines at last ticket
<br>the ruby troubles en masse. Always it is reddish at the tops of

<p>the sharper mountains. I have no trouble. A handle on that tree
<br>came away like news. It was impenetrable to maintain, it was last
<br>to be. Or watch four hours of electric fish. Supposed made safe

<p>the caves all locked away bite. A vacuum is wasted aboard. I wanted
<br>to get the scissors fired up here. Might the matter turn? Thick
<br>ruby on the fire escape, I'm not surprised at the wheat in the sky.

<p>It's pert, this knock. From her gown, the handle taken down. They say
<br>which we have had, touch? Ja. Down with all their says. I am merely
<br>perhaps to find the same locked lines. Flea cap, modest pate.

<p>Light on making their turns. What in the world if the ducks had
<br>fingers? Mountains in the street. Right, the matter of airplane
<br>flare. Surgery cracked and was gone. Ducks in ruby trouble. Hear

<p>my tool? Four old squats, good morning. Behind which dawn at
<br>the top of those mountains a street. Blessing the raisins there
<br>with turpentine. The duck had not set foot on their property. Lugs.

<p>Tolds. Loose in the pictures of any beaches. A pumpable horn.
<br>Double term at the same mill. And then the news of any sugar
<br>in my fire. Other ways to say, which top so sharp? As if were there,

<p>those birds I mean. Trouble after all takes takers. The matter with
<br>airplanes that they won't hide? Mountains rose at that old firehouse.
<br>Lady all ears at the angel stakes, maternal room for the difficult

<p>buzzing. For the lending I come out of log-roll hiding. Why not
<br>a wasted wing? Enroll in rushing around, table map dangling.
<br>I opened those mountains, world. A mighty sharp ring means too much

<p>food. Yourself and the fact of home. Perhaps I have smiled.
<br>The truckers rehearsed at the firing of the light. All there took
<br>a taste of duck. Smiled and walked himself loose. I may say of

<p>birds, they won't. The day of the woman's way of food. Oof. Lucky
<br>needers dialing in a blend of shoe make witness of us all. Even
<br>in this sort of vacuum, nice of you to knock. Smelled a presence.

<p>Out front it didn't quite matter. Six quislings aboard, hands on
<br>their wings. Let's go up behind the beach and love in pockets.
<br>A sample result of birds with too much food. Vacuum failure? Plane

<p>with spine cracks. Did you come home, there was light on, duck?
<br>Airplanes thick again fired on ducks. Perhaps, gravy, you'll talk about
<br>your pictures of spectacles. I am late at dawn with mine.
