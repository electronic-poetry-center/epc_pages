	<blockquote><blockquote>

The possibilities for statement in art are taken in quite different directions in the work of
three contemporary poets: Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman, and Steve Benson. Like the
sculptor Robert Smithson, all three work toward a greater scale in art, and their solutions
to the problems of scale reveal new developments in syntax.<sup>1</sup>

<p>In <i>Nadja</i>, Andr&eacute; Breton makes a curious statement, but one that indicates his own
priorities: "As far as I am concerned, a mind's arrangement with regard to certain objects
is even more important than its regard for certain arrangements of objects, these two kinds
of arrangement controlling between them all forms of sensibility."<sup>2</sup> The "mind's
arrangement with regard to certain objects" is certainly at the basis of syntax in the work
of both Breton and Smithson. Breton's surrealist image fixes the flux of automatism in
static images, simple objects. Later, an object can be incorporated directly into the poem,
which is essentially an oneiric form, without any loss in translation. Nadja is one such
oneiric object--a woman. Smithson's generative syntax begins with tropes that are
refractions of a single object seen through the lens of an ironic observer. They prepare the
ground for other objects on larger, more monumental scales--such as the Spiral Jetty.

<p>In the work of Coolidge, Silliman, and Benson there is, without wishing to overdraw a
comparison, a syntactic basis in a "regard for certain arrangements of objects." A relation
<i>between</i> things, a situation with its <i>own</i> laws, is the point of departure. Any given "object" has an essential relation to other objects as well as a disposition to the observer. The
observer, rather than being ironic, is responsible to the contingencies of any <i>things</i> that
might compel him or her. The situation as a whole must be taken in--linguistic, social,
psychological--and is not just a projection of the observer. The syntax of the world is
elusive, though what is seen in this syntax is different in the case of each writer.

<p>Clark Coolidge must be given credit for realizing the possibilities of <i>extension</i> of a syntax of "arrangement," although a number of writers have preceded him in recognizing its
possibilities for art. The mimicking of the painterly surface in the first generation of New
York School poets (John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Frank O'Hara), as well as the
performance values of experimentalists such as John Cage and Jackson Mac Low, are the
two major influences, with Gertrude Stein and Williams's experimental prose in the
shadowy past. Coolidge's extension of this possibility proceeded in a deliberate, step-by-step manner over the course of his work. Its contribution to the question of scale in art is
due to its exploration of the psychological implications of "arrangement"--extending
experimentalism where it may have reached a dead end in painterly surfaces or
performance values.

<p>Coolidge's first collection, <i>Space</i>, shows the influence of the painterly surface of the New York School poets, and it also shows the beginning of the path beyond. The book is
divided into four sections, each a characteristic area of work. A number of works in the
first section bear a close resemblance to the kind of cut-up, painterly lyricism of John
Ashbery's <i>The Tennis Court Oath</i>, which uses a number of "exterior" procedures on
found texts in a kind of "all-over" mimicry of the surfaces of abstract expressionism. The
materials used are generally ironic and aestheticized at the same time; false scenarios,
inappropriate remarks, and a skewed, unmotivated syntax reflect the mind at work, along
with a continual hint of the philosophical relevance of the impossibility of statement.
However aestheticized, the work was a significant breakthrough, as evidenced by the
number of its immediate followers. A work by Coolidge that is relevant to this context is
the second poem in the book, "The Image Furnace, Under Brine":

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the good ease!," sighed slamming his pencil
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vacuum of the light bulb drop, the sigh
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sign vent of its
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slat
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>

<p>The gestures here are much like Ashbery's: "sighed slamming his pencil" betrays the
anxiety of the fragmentary; "the sigh/sign vent of its/slat" seems to find a high irony in the
problem of representing a mental state. But the emphasis of these anxious fragments is
differently arranged than in Ashbery--there is a stronger, more propulsive pulse, an
underlining of rhythmic play. This emphasis on the rhythmic, purely temporal dimension
sets Coolidge off from the other imitators of <i>The Tennis Court Oath</i>. Coolidge sees
Kerouac's "spontaneous bop prosody" in these cool surfaces, bringing to mind Coolidge's
brief career as a jazz drummer. The temporal axis gives the go-ahead into a different
aesthetic space, in much the same way that pure mental projection gave Smithson his permission. The materials and impulses can be given a kind of play--in the ironizing of
meaning in Smithson, or in its basic mutability toward sound in Coolidge.

<p>The jazz drummer is clearly visible in "Bontecou Chandelier"

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jars &nbsp;&nbsp;jars &nbsp;&nbsp;jars &nbsp;&nbsp;oil &nbsp;&nbsp;staples &nbsp;&nbsp;donuts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wire, at the wrist, the Hey
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crenulated. &nbsp;&nbsp;Absolving. &nbsp;&nbsp;Holiday Swells.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jersey, Jersey (16)

<p>If sound is leading Coolidge into the words, the sense is not far behind. The word stock of
the above passage is consistently "American Industrial," a vocabulary of castoffs and slag
heaps that might be typical of visual artists like Rauschenberg, Johns, and later, Smithson.
The listing "jars jars jars" gives an immediately cultural component to the rhythmic drive--one could also have "cars cars cars" or "bars bars bars" and be giving a good picture of
what actually follows, "Jersey, Jersey." The scenario in these works is quite different from
the more abstract compositional plane of Ashbery--it is the practical, object-oriented,
American cultural desert that Coolidge is trying to beat into life. The identification with
Kerouac, in a form quite different from the spontaneous sketching of <i>Visions of Cody</i>, is
still marked. A new value is being given to "calling up things by their names" in the willful
drive of the sound. This syntax is certainly far from that asserted on the dust jacket, where
"syntax . . . is simply removed."

<p>Words in Coolidge are cultural facts, rhythmic and semantic imponderables. There are, in
real time and space, whole landscapes of such imponderables; they stare one in the face
with artifice and inertness, as in Las Vegas. No cultural nationalist, however, Coolidge is
not tied down to any simplistic tagging of his materials. The America of his word stock is
assumed, leaving open more universal questions as the ontology and psychology of such
language. From the development of work in <i>Space</i> (which may not be chronological),
Coolidge appears to be increasingly drawn to a scrutiny of words, to questions of their
ultimate nature. The third section moves away from the more extended works, which still
appear to be bounded by the single page frame of the conventional lyric, to constructions
that deliberate over weights and balances of words in highly delimited arrangements.
Words are not being given "object status" here; rather, they are being questioned in terms
of their relations with other words. One such poem, quoted in full:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ounce code orange
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ohm
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trilobite trilobites (68)

<p>Coolidge discusses his motivation in this work in the following terms: "I couldn't stand
the idea of one word. I don't think there is one word. ... I was really trying to work with
the words, look at the words, try to use all their qualities. There's no question of meaning,
in the sense of explaining and understanding this poem. Hopefully, it's a unique object, not just an object. Language isn't just objects, it moves."<sup>4</sup>

<p>The power of words is not in their status as objects but in their relation to each other. This
concern, which runs deep in Coolidge's work, is also stated in an earlier interview: "That's
like my idea about arrangement . . . an old alchemical notion that if you take objects, like
the objects on this table, any objects, and arrange them in the correct order, that some
incredible shift, or something, would happen. Something would be affected. Like the
power is in the arrangement not in the objects."<sup>5</sup> It is the arrangement of words that
unlocks their energies, drives the temporal event. But if words are like objects in an
arrangement, there is still a question, for Coolidge, of particular qualities of these entities
motivating their possible arrangements. His attention to words is to their differential status
on a number of linguistic levels that qualify their use in combination:

<blockquote>"ohm" is the unit of electrical resistance, a quality of metal, let's say, that requires a certain amount of juice to go through. In other words, this is a fuzzy, resistant word   
trilobites": you know what a trilobite is, it's an early animal of the Paleozoic Age that was
a crustacean divided into three lobes. As a word to me it's completely irreducible. What
are you going to do with it? "A trilobite": it's like a clinker. ("Arrangement")</blockquote>

<p>Here Coolidge looks <i>into</i> the word--it is not just a question of surface characteristics. The meditation on semantics is enacted in the way the words are placed on the page.

<p>This meditation on semantics can be seen even in those works that use entities below the
level of the word, in Coolidge's case morphemes such as "ed," "ing," "tion," and so on.
The following is from the last page of "A D," the last work in <i>Space</i>:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;erything
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eral
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stantly
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ined
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ards
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nize &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(120)

<p>These morphemes become words, motivated by their (vertical, sequential) arrangement to
the same possibilities of statement. Each is a whole, and like "trilobites" they are
irreducible "clinkers."

<p>Possibly Coolidge's most famed investigation into the possibilities of arrangement is in a
work published as a separate pamphlet, <i>Suite V</i>. The poems in this work are composed of
two words per 8 1/2-by-11-inch page, placed at the top and bottom, with plenty of white
space in between. All the words are four-lettered, and all have an <i>s</i> at the end. Some of
these minimal pairs are: "taps / / buns," "keys / / ohms," cans / / arms," and so on.<sup>6</sup> The amount of space between the words is significant--there is a palpable time-lag between
them. The page is being used to specify an interval in time. The temporal gap here induces
a certain energy between the words, similar to that of Pierre Reverdy's "light of the
image" produced by the pairing of unrelated verbal images, though without particular
attention to time. Coolidge has also explored this semantic potential energy gap in a work
involving tape loops, in which two loops at different speeds are phased in and out with
each other and the phase interaction is recorded. The words on the two tape loops can be
heard as two separate words at their maximum temporal spread, or as a phrase of some
kind when occurring close to each other in time. The question is when and under what
conditions this phrase linkage will occur and what kind of energy will be produced. The
phenomenology of syntax is being considered quite literally here, though it should be
remembered that Coolidge is listening to the energy of the statement as a compositional
possibility for his work.

<p>This analytic interest in the potential energies of words in arrangements is equaled by an
expressive impulse in Coolidge that reflects his reading of Kerouac. The opposite of the
technical, this identification is cultural (New England) as well as stylistic ("spontaneous
bop prosody"). Coolidge's contribution to <i>The World</i>&nbsp;'s "Autobiography" issue begins:

<blockquote>let's chug it up to Diamond . . . maybe or Calumet . . . Jesus, Calumet in the dark? . . . or go climb the Geofort . . . naw, you crazy? we'll get snagged in our basement coats . . . shit on the fucking around we gotta go . . . well, Ray, you know, if we go, we'll end up with your a----s on fire . . . well actually, . . . if you light . . . my ass . . . on fire . . . those guys in the project put their lights'll always go on . . . let's go . . . maybe we can practice to shit off the edge a thousand feet &amp; then the beercans . . . Jesus Ray, remember that time we were goin up in the dark &amp; you got around above somewhere somehow &amp; pushed a huge fucking block
loose &amp; down past us? . . . saw the blue sparks . . . Jesus, you really scared the shit out of us . . . Dave . . . HA-<i>HA!</i> HA-<i>HA!</i>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup></blockquote>

<p>The spontaneous verbalizing here has an adolescent character; names and dates on granite
in white paint are a similar graphemic response to the New England mentality. The
"mouthing off" in this piece seems to be a linguistic "carrier frequency" that can go on
indefinitely. In Kerouac an echo of this kind of verbalizing produced a breakthrough in
prose, one that is very much on Coolidge's mind:

<blockquote>I was thinking of those long, long sentences [in Kerouac] where he's doing what he calls sketching. He might literally be in front of the subject, or it might be in his mind. It might be a brick wall, or that incredible section of the food in the windows, or the cafeteria
section in the beginning of <i>Visions of Cody</i>. Where it goes on for endless pages. It's this
beautiful line, it's always changing. Things'll just pop up, and you can see that he didn't
think of that. It just came, because he was following this line, what's next, what's next.<sup>8</sup></blockquote>

<p>As opposed to the possibilities of combination and recombination Coolidge sees in
arrangement, this mode of writing is not reducible to components. Coolidge is interested
here in the vectoral potentials of work on a single scale--that of the writer in time. In this
sense writing is self-sufficient, a "pure product of America," adequate in itself.

<p>In work that appeared after the publication of <i>Space</i>, Coolidge moves away from the
conventional page frame of the lyric poem into longer forms. <i>The Maintains</i> builds a 100-page poem from language taken from the dictionary (and possibly other sources). The
breakthrough in this work is Coolidge's use of an "equivalency principle" in the line that
demands a larger form. The syntax of statement in the poem is not only word-to-word (as
in "jars jars jars") but line-to-line:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the canna seats
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a shine-hard common
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so-called boat tooth of like shape from the rolls
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on which hue a saturation is secured
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a candle about the mouth
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mosquito cans stated limes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recorded off the bark or mummy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overhang to sing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fine coal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or book list of good mass or omen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mustard simple
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses clot in another machines
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pie star sliding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a perpetual vow<sup>9</sup>

<p>There is a metalinguistic architecture, derived from the dictionary definition, behind every
line. Each line could be a definition of the line previous, and they all might be understood
as definitions of "word." A "shine-hard common" could be a definition of "canna seats,"
with the advantages of ambiguity ("seats" is a noun or a verb) and a synaesthetic image in
"shine-hard seats." The play of language is built on the structure of the line. It is possible
to see each line as commenting on the one above or as an independent arrangement. The
poem continually argues this edge between self-sufficiency and connection. Individual
words or phrases may stand out as entities, but they are motivated by their sequence.
Language is being proposed as a relation between words--ironically or perhaps
didactically, as the dictionary is the source of that language.

<p>The structural concerns of <i>The Maintains</i> are developed in the course of Coolidge's next
100-page poem, <i>Polaroid</i>. The "nounal" emphasis of the line is undermined, first by the
use of nonsubstantives and then by the breaking up of the line's accretive "equivalence
principle." The last section of the poem is a kind of synthesis of these developments; a
new line has been produced in the process, one that increases the ambiguities of syntax as
it allows for greater rhythmic variation:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few part once and then one as around leaves close stays then some
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of you few head so forth by whom why leave either to go
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part and it leaves once you then some do you within stays behind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either few or just some once of either leaving miss it to close to it beside
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the either one or it you part per whom via either one or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few do stay once it's close to you missing the whole either one<sup>10</sup>

<p>The phrase structure of these lines could be bracketed in numerous ways; 'few do stay
once it's close" could be, at least: (few do) (stay once) (it's close); (few do stay) (once it's
close); (few do stay once) (it's close); and (few do) (stay once it's close). In addition, each
word could be given temporal autonomy, as in a list. The possibilities for variation of
stress in reading the work, given these multiple bracketings, are enormous. Where the
bracketing of the line in <i>The Maintains</i> is reinforced by the dictionary definition, in
<i>Polaroid</i> the bracketing is plural, reflecting the multiple elliptical constructions of
American English (a structure much more complex than its dictionary). Here there is what
Williams called a "buckling" of syntax; words snap in and out of different combinations in
a line. The rhythmic play is much more various than in the simple reiterative structure of
<i>The Maintains</i>.

<p>In Coolidge's work after <i>Polaroid</i> words are not only used for their potential energies in
possible arrangements but point simultaneously to other contexts in the world or in the
mind. This expansion of scale parallels a shift in technique from the lyric frame to long
verse structures in accretive lines to a mode that Coolidge has designated as "prosoid": an extended, dense, lyric prose form that has past examples in Williams's <i>Kora in Hell</i>,
Stein's <i>The Making of Americans</i>, surrealist automatic texts, and, more contemporary,
Robert Creeley's <i>Presences</i>. One such work is "Smithsonian Depositions," based on
Smithson's writings as well as on numerous other sources such as:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Carlos Williams: The Selected Letters; Paterson
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean-Luc Godard: Pierrot Mon Ami; Les Carabiniers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alain Robbe-Grillet: Last Year at Marienbad
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salvador Dali: The Secret Life of Salvador Dali
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Le Conte: Elements of Geology . . . <sup>11</sup>

<p>as well as journals and newspaper clippings. Content is layered in the work in a
"geological" manner, inspired by the "language as matter formulation of Smithson's work.
The text is evocative of the strata of the linguistic bedrock, the reality of which is
psychological (memory) as well as cultural (historical time), while still maintaining
Coolidge's basic writing values as "spontaneous bop prosodist."

<p>Coolidge's breakthrough work in the "prosoid" form, <i>Quartz Hearts</i>, is in fact a
preparatory study for his still untitled "longwork." "It is in every sense a hinge work,"
begun during writing of the last section of <i>Polaroid</i>. The work is densely argued,
involving a querying of the words as they are being produced to make sentences.
Statements exist as words and in their "other," referential contexts:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked up and knocked at the front.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shoe was the same color as the step.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car had an open top that he never
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked out of as he drove straight
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ahead. An iron mushroom.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking up close to the wall, I felt
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heat from above, and heard the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horn below the floor.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black tree on a purple shoulder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sock hidden in the stump. Pliers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a room beneath a wind across a valley.<sup>12</sup>

<p>The balance of words within a sentence, again an arrangement, is as much the subject
matter here as what the sentences actually say. But possibly there really <i>were</i> "Pliers in a
room beneath a wind across a valley."

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a block on the door.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle turned out to be square.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little women sending postcards from a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donut factory. They swim toward the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end of the land. An opening gradually
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presents itself and arrives.

<p>The work seems to be arguing inward, starting from simple, if ironic, units of statement in
language. There is a metalinguistic underpinning that is being used to fabricate the context
for the next statement, as in "An opening gradually presents itself and arrives." Reference
builds structure into statement by virtue of a querying of its essential purposes.

<p>Only sections of the "longwork" have been published as yet, so it is difficult at this point
to have an accurate sense of it as a whole. Initially intended to go to 1,000 pages,
Coolidge read the first 200 pages over seven nights at Eighty Langton Street, San
Francisco, in 1979.<sup>13</sup> It is generally understood to be based on a limited number of subject areas, such as geology, the movies, the music of Ives, the writings of Beckett and Creeley,
and so on. These are the sources for language materials to be used in the work. There are
"topic" sections, in which one particular subject is developed, and "transitional" sections,
between subject areas. Medial spaces between areas of language are being "bred," much as
in the "geological" interaction of materials in "Smithsonian Depositions," and the work
undertakes a large-scale assimilation of related language (taken in at the point of writing,
from more "daily" frames) in its development. The steady force of construction is in a
constitutive voice, a kind of "verbalizing" carrier frequency generally located "in back of"
the utterances of speech (or conventional lyric poetry), a foregrounding of the involuntary
memory. The weight of the linguistic materials is balanced in multiple "buckling" prosoid
lines. The work mimics an assertion of the self-evident world in a highly elaborate cross-referencing of multiple arrangements. Within the work there is a constant play of unusual
"light of the image" between the variously juxtaposed arrangements of words. In this
created world there are endlessly refracted interstices, shadows of words creating space
for new words in the shadows. In real time and space, the voice in the work intends a
present: "What moves can make space," as Coolidge said in writing of Larry Figner.
Physical space is being carved out of linguistic space by means of vectors through the
combinatorial potentials of the American word stock. The work is presented as an
unanalyzable, though completely refracted, whole.

<p>There is, in this work, a definite monumentality. Unlike the Spiral Jetty, the monument is
temporal, not spatial, but perhaps it does approach an "object status." Coolidge's gesture
after reading the work--prior to any discussion--was simply to place its two volumes on
the table between the writer and his audience: "Here it is." However, the work has not yet
been named. From "Weathers," a section of the work:

<blockquote>Slipping from, tell me, this is a star and that a fin. That bottle keeps its blink on its side red from horizon. He left it to sun in the hard, black is not black it's night. State of Cadmium set in stint. This is blurring not what could be said from a table to be a ledge. Where,
losing firm, is the percolator or perimeter. Thus and so, parts of a limb on a walk, of a
bird, myself or have I thought myself febrile.<sup>14</sup></blockquote>

<p>The writer appears to be out in the "welter of forms of these events, the events being
writing first of all but mimicking a condition as allencompassing as the weather. Journals
kept of weather phenomena were the basis for this section, but observations of "daily life"
and the weather are functionally close at the level of words. The need to repair the
typewriter, the word "Cadmium," and a dark lowering cloud at 4 P.M. are equivalent
terms of the work. A more strictly literary area of language is explored in another section:

<blockquote>Caught an eryops. The sander says misericordia. Coronal of thicket plums. A stanchion of much aisle, even, though wooden. Blending stonelight with cornhusker's celimate. Left
themselves open to the announcement none of these people died on time. Though
Huxley's faith in Iguanodon's bipedality was totally vindicated in 1878 when an entire
troupe of iguanodonts emerged from a coal mine in Belgium, the fissure filled with
Cretaceous marls. As the thought to tower an erect beast, an enigma remains itself a plural
impasse.</blockquote>

<p>"Eryops" is a word from Smithson, though it segues back to its geological home to meet
"an entire troupe of iguanodonts." There are other such delimited zones of vocabulary
("misericordia," "cornhusker"), along with a running comment that is the compositional
drive of the work: "an enigma remains itself a plural impasse."

<p>Coolidge is not forthcoming on his techniques, but I imagine a writing scenario as follows:
words or materials (open books, clippings) are on a table next to a typewriter. Some of
these materials might be past pages of the work. The writing is a spontaneous invention
starting from these "exterior" materials, and the argument of the work that develops is a
projection of the interior voice onto exterior words within a specific temporal frame. This
argument is both associative (words lead to arrangements in terms of linguistic affinity and
memory traces of their prior use) and dissociative (sequence is used to disrupt habitual
patterns of thought). The exterior vocabulary is the cue for both the association and the
dissociation--it can lead into a new arrangement, or it can introduce a dissonance that
disrupts an arrangement. The "light of the image" that is being given off by these
arrangements is an object of meditation as the work progresses, although it is primarily
sound, as rhythmic variation being driven by subliminal verbalizing, that is leading the
writing from word to word.

<p>The concerns of this work have much to do with surrealist automatism, though for
Coolidge any such "pure psychic automatism" is coincident with words as objects--perhaps
literally, in front of him on the writing table. The incorporation of purely literary
information, such as the Huxley anecdote above, is evidence of this without any
confirmation from the author. The vocabulary in the work is not limited to the word stock
of surrealism, with its basically interior and organic scenarios, which often seem overly
delimited by the past example of Lautr&eacute;amont. The surrealists excluded large sections of
language as quotidian, and certainly words <i>as words</i> had no status for them. The sign is
united with its object--there can be no dissociation at this level of language; once used in
the writing process, a word or an image is used up. In Coolidge's work the sign is a
multiple and possibly exterior reality, and words like "thus and so" have the status of
substantives in the work. The relation to language is evaluative as opposed to convulsive--there is a "thinking with things as they exist" as much as any flux of the automatic image.
Other aspects of the phenomenology of language than the irruption of the pleasure
principle are primary--namely, the axis of memory and the associative contiguities of
words. The word <i>iguanodon</i>, established in a brief narrative, may have a continuing life in
the work, and it is given a value in contiguous strata (in "eryops" above). Any word in the
text can become the enigma of the plural impasse; the act of writing is the continual
querying of these impasses by words.

<p>The status of involuntary memory is quite different in Coolidge than in surrealism. In
surrealism, the involuntary memory is to some extent theoretical--it gives a value for the
automatic image; but in actual practice the work is voluntary and literary--the language of
automatism is bounded by fixed parameters of style. Surrealist automatic images often
seem to be "exemplary" of the possibilities of automatism--there was no need for the
investigation of the automatic impulse on a large (say, 1,000-page) scale. This fixity of the
surrealist image is the principal defect in its claims for "pure psychic automatism,"
rendering the project only partially successful in terms of psychology. But in literary terms,
the use of the automatic image as a philosopher's stone leads to its success--the more
developed formulations of Breton's theoretical works and of <i>Nadja</i>.

<p>In Coolidge, involuntary memory is taken on directly. The improvisatory mode of writing
has access to the vectors of subjectivity precisely because its initial objects--words--are
conceived of as exterior to the writer, to be taken on in the ongoing construction of the
work. The scale of Coolidge's improvisatory mode is very large in terms of the language
and states of mind it can reach; the position of the writer, however, is fixed--there is no
travel to the Yucatan, even with mirrors. Writing is a daily task, and the temporal demands
of the work are a part of its argument with existence. Language is no philosopher's stone
for Coolidge--any theoretical extension of the project is blocked at the "point of
production." Coolidge declines to make a metaphor of his work; the querying of language
by language <i>in time</i> is the method.

<p>The work is driven into its particulars by this refusal of metaphorical scale. Where
Smithson proposes the scale of his work as a metaphor for art, Coolidge holds back from
such structural metaphors. The question of overall form is therefore problematic. Where
earlier works such as <i>The Maintains</i> and <i>Polaroid</i> coincide at least with temporal frames (they are each one year's writing), the time frame of the "longwork" is open-ended, and it
is unclear what it would mean for it to end. Perhaps the only developing structural
metaphor in Coolidge's work is that of the romantic subject, certainly an unwieldy figure
to maintain.

<p>But Coolidge's syntax is not to be understood only in its temporal sequence. There is a
"spatial" syntax of the work as well. The writing continually foregrounds language as its
primary reality in the uninterrupted refractions of the form. In the extended time frame of
the work, a word at any moment must stand for the whole. Starting from these particulars,
the work has a point-by-point structural basis in <i>metonymy</i>. In a standard example of
metonymy "Moscow" stands for the system of government located there. One can say,
"Go ahead, Moscow, I'm listening," but Coolidge would substitute the word <i>word</i> there
instead: "Go ahead, <i>word</i>&nbsp;, I'm listening," in a device to be found everywhere in his work. The various linguistic levels--word, line, phrase, sentence, paragraph--are all structural
metonyms for "language" and, ultimately, for "the writer in time." By means of this
continual metonymy, the large-scale forms of Coolidge's work, and whatever
metaphorical meaning they might have, are argued in the work at numerous levels of
language.

<p>For example, in the early lyrics the status of words as American imponderables is a
metonym for the actual "state of the art." These atomized "associative contiguities" are
inspired by similar values for individual words in Kerouac's sketching. The dictionary
definition of <i>The Maintains</i> offers a metonym at another linguistic level; the definiendum is
the "part" to the "whole" of the semantic component in language, which is ironically
addressed. In the long line of <i>Polaroid</i>, the shifting brackets of phrase structure are a
metonym for the "indeterminacy" of the whole. In <i>Quartz Hearts</i>, the sentence is a
metonym for the act of writing, and the "prosoid" paragraph is a metonym for the time
frame of the entire work. In the "longwork" the shifting line of the improvisation stands in
a part/whole relation to the fixed position of the writer. In each of these works, in
addition, the word-to-word argument is a metonym for structure at each point in time.
"Iguanodon" is a partial assertion of the possibility of naming; when iguanodonts march
out of the cave's mouth, they can only be ironic. Any such acts are never more than
accidents of parts that interact with each other within the totalizing whole.

<p>Smithson's work invokes a stopped, ironic time, to extend the scale of the work. For a
similar reason, the time of the work in Coolidge wants never to end. Its "association by
contiguity" is unrestricted; language can only be a metonym for the writer in time. The
possibility of naming is inferred, but nothing other than that is actually named. This
holding back gives a kind of timelessness to the writer's act in time--all energy of
statement is potential. A deferred approach to the world motivates the expansion of scale.
Coolidge's time frame approaches the literal, while the work stands apart.
