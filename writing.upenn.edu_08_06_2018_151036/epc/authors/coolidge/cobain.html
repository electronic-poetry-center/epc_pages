<p>Reach for it 
<br>reach for the moment it takes 
<br>play for the big things 
<br>bring 
<br>to a stop and hear the birds ring 
<br>trying 
<br>to drop to a standstill 
<br>it's time 
<br>to nail this pain to a smile 
<br>it's this 
<br>time 
<br>then it's not now it's not

<p>Stake for it, trial for it 
<br>manage then bust more than quite 
<br>I bring it back to me 
<br>to you to me to you 
<br>to me 
<br>haven't I the plastic?

<p>I got over it though 
<br>through it I never knew it 
<br>had to duck this moon 
<br>when somebody threw it 
<br>here is knowledge, a quitter 
<br>a meltdown, I'm feeling better 
<br>this in water, this is squat

<p>Pretend it's pretty 
<br>I'll hand it back 
<br>walk all over me 
<br>that's a memory 
<br>splendid, a substance 
<br>drain it all, penury
<br>substitute a substitute 
<br>I'll got a better blender 
<br>published perished or not 
<br>this is the end

<p>Broken till it's bright out 
<br>honest an a weapon open as a weapon 
<br>the time the door didn't go right by 
<br>this time you felt it with your head

<p>I have fumblings catered rampant 
<br>I know the looks scan scum like salad 
<br>there's nothing to stand on but you 
<br>nothing but what I'll be wearing

<p>Substitute for throat, substitute for thought 
<br>put down your rock, take back your talk 
<br>granted it's pleasant, plush for a ribbing 
<br>stop with the foreskin, that backstroke

<p>But he's a liver he wants 
<br>no time at all then it slants 
<br>poetry is level should be faults 
<br>a mark on the wall from your gravel

<p>Substance, substance twice 
<br>I'll live as long as you're nice 
<br>you're known 
<br>gone out hunting for the trouble 
<br>where at what end are you 
<br>lush as a chain a ruptured pair 
<br>nodded into hiding, unable

<p>So what does it last for? 
<br>tucked into a crime, saddled with an air 
<br>what is this angle to your travel 
<br>codicil, bent inkwell, heady boy trying to smell 
<br>bricked in and tumbling, spell me the circle 
<br>so much of this light is unlawful

<p>Spitted on a silence 
<br>shocked at your deed 
<br>you shine you pretend 
<br>gold weight, clock of the sun 
<br>a daughter of the rainy Siam

<p>Breach your lack of aim 
<br>the feel pays you out 
<br>a coughing lick of water 
<br>grows it by the hour 
<br>I'm sitting so fleet 
<br>day out, stay sure 
<br>tantrums, bubblegums 
<br>howl of the penetrated shopper

<p>And grow a gun as big as your nose 
<br>shut this whistle on that nutter 
<br>civilization smells of tubesteak 
<br>flatter the waiter on the governor's daughter 
<br>the gold tugged from a slipping dancer 
<br>a stinger 
<br>a hiatus 
<br>a layer

<p>I heard it, I tell you, I doubt it 
<br>the bone is cool, made mental, a housing 
<br>how much farther do we get with this naming? 
<br>I shut myself in with this window, was a blow to me 
<br>was a blow to you, the strength lying open 
<br>toughen it up for the ending 
<br>even the sea can't mend this sundown

<p>Shut your light, shut the shade 
<br>there's a sinking table aimless in our place 
<br>I raise, raises me, for you all to keep raising on 
<br>that door is such a torch for throwing things back 
<br>on a chorus of the throatless, dive

<p>Dive, the graceless 
<br>where you go up and where are we? 
<br>scopolamine is mine, from the trouble to the strewn 
<br>grammar take no 
<br>if he never leaves he never bleeds 
<br>never reads he never rusts 
<br>part where it only hurts at night 
<br>and the trestle bombs under the bridge 
<br>so, are you being come in on? 
<br>stretch, it's not cold enough 
<br>yet to start your heart

<p>The birds live across from my starvation 
<br>I send friendships from my station 
<br>pasty lips but a pinhole brought plenty 
<br>you can't have it all so bring it empty

<p>Fought out like a full black stinger into 
<br>the throat of your heart 
<br>I gave up the device of thinking, inking, king 
<br>sort of flat we'll develop the ounce 
<br>the head went off into the slamming tunnel once

<p>Reach for it 
<br>reach for the moment it takes 
<br>play for the big things 
<br>bring 
<br>to a stop and hear the birds ring 
<br>trying 
<br>to drop to a standstill 
<br>it's time 
<br>to nail this pain to a smile 
<br>it's this 
<br>time
<br>then it's not now it's not
