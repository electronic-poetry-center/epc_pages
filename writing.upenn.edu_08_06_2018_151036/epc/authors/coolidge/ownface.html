<b>Connie's Scared</b>

<p>The wind came up, the radishes died and
<br>the peelings continued. No one could be
<br>more hostile than a species enclosed in
<br>a chimney for a century or so they told me.
<br>The lighter fluid on the other hand might warm
<br>your nails.  We deserve overtime
<br>for dealing daily with these mistreated burdens.
<br>The milkweed pods for no reason in the world
<br>we could see ignited and the frog is loose.
<br>The mail at last arrived but you had better
<br>proceed to lick your envelopes more heartily
<br>as they all came empty.  No one exactly states
<br>but everybody thinks the whole world level
<br>has been lowered and continues.  If the flame
<br>goes out the food will spoil, remember?

<p>Then there is the problem of the stray moose
<br>to be seen from the road or better not, bring
<br>apples, take pictures, but the village idiot
<br>had his son throw rocks.  The later thunder
<br>around the sleeping household was a mere
<br>five minutes herd of cows.  And Rip Rowan thought that
<br>thunder was produced by two crickets banging
<br>garbage cans together.  Tomorrow the snow will
<br>be higher and the school fail to attract.  I pay
<br>for entrance to this life by my exit, can't wait
<br>each morning to treat of impossible questions and
<br>have never been depressed.  Makes you wonder,
<br>all these seacows spitting on their tails,
<br>flashing lights on the spaceride and even in my dreams.
<br>Claimed I awoke from the fight I couldn't win.
<br>Chained my warts to a snowcone.

<p>Across the street are many stray dogs but whose
<br>fault are the cats.  Something terrible's going on
<br>in the woods the rabbit is screaming, the cat
<br>distinctly calling your name, nothing that can't
<br>be solved with golf club and pistol empty. Lock
<br>your house when you leave for the auto.  The company
<br>that brought you pasteboard frowns on too many
<br>fallen trees.  Check your son's teeth when he eats
<br>or he'll end a blimp.  A crib death when a baby's
<br>network lapses mid-breath.  The television not collapse
<br>but slowly burn out.  And that cooking by radar might cost
<br>you a few meals.  There goes another roast beast.

<p>The adult book human gunned down as he left.  Seems
<br>the nature of crime to go unsolved, covered up,
<br>never caught.  Sal Mineo, for one.  If so, wouldn't
<br>you want your kids to stop it.  A gay couple hated
<br>for their foul language not their sex.  But the fat weather
<br>woman terminated as a lesbian.  Stamp out discomfort
<br>and lift a heel for bliss.  Heaven more attractive
<br>now that harps are out of style.  One arm in a sling
<br>and the other in a bear.  At the loss of life and
<br>limb remain cool.  Their son last seen chewed by
<br>croc in pool of steam.

<p>There is no longer any Florida and Christmas nowhere.
<br>The men removed our home sometime lastnite while
<br>we shook.  Asked me how I felt and what he could do
<br>with his mike.  All my girlfriends have been raped,
<br>some in basements, some by families.  Even in the movies
<br>they don't know they can complain.  Reels mixed, eyesight
<br>tearing.  Heard they've even left the lights on in space.
<br>The dawning hastes and subsequent vagueries.
<br>Never a morning wake but I congeal.
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<p><b>In Positions is the Matter</b>

<p>That the birds sizzle on the ledge, they are at
<br>their food.

<p>When the wind stirs the twigs, it is seen
<br>that they are of wire.

<p>Are distant mountains merely outlines of a noon.

<p>I open and read the pages by myself.

<p>The summer has been cold, as the saying goes.

<p>Then the pen rises blunt like the moon.
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;


<p><b>At the Poem</b>

<p>You must have missed the signpost, took
<br>the wrong turning, ended up for the sore moment
<br>in that mud without holes.  You must gaze
<br>into the sun here to take your rest, suspend
<br>motion and speech on a point of
<br>zircon sand.  The only articulate surfaces, they
<br>are also somehow sounds, are buildings which
<br>as you approach pour their facades at your feet
<br>in a rush of the purest substances.
<br>There are no faces to be seen since all
<br>that is human here is you.
<br>Numbers are become animal forms: the pounce,
<br>the adder and the lynx.  The things you loved
<br>are all shades of moss.
<br>Your only index the very grains of sand.
<br>And somehow the set of things has you again,
<br>a fascination in love of self.
<p>&nbsp;
