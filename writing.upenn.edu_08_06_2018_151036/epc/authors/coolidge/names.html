<p>Billy Nestler 
<br>on the run but sitting still 
<br>shaking the origins

<p>Onyx Hinkley 
<br>positioned over a drain

<p>Bud Vaut 
<br>nobody wanted to listen to him 
<br>stand

<p>Hiram Trunk 
<br>the balls were housed in the low backs of his thin grey past

<p>Dad Longworth 
<br>trained on the town where truth came to zero

<p>Roger Pellet 
<br>in town the day the coffins came through Penalty Hill 
<br>horizon train hydrangeas in cement flames

<p>Parly Baer 
<br>terrible in hair

<p>Overage Staroopian 
<br>found the codgers some fine pine lodges 
<br>coughed, but in name only

<br>hankered into a pyre of rust

<p>Ridgepole Dick 
<br>a nestler

<p>I saw Crumpeter Cave invent a body wallet 
<br>yes, in tossed topaz and lime 
<br>so beer were his streets the veneer came completely 
<br>Ollie was his other

<p>Occipiter Veinload committed a crime 
<br>but then there was nothing 
<br>a gem glow beneath all polizei pockets 
<br>he got wheatlamp rockets and flies and just so

<p>Attadime Mainway 
<br>over by the cow platz 
<br>colored inky and felt himself stern 
<br>to know the betrayal of openings

<p>But this was all an unknown to old Billy Partial 
<br>the groaner at dated entranceways 
<br>concessioner of nods 
<br>the companion and barrelroller of Billy Sentence 
<br>covering enabler of a balance in waiting

<p>There is always trouble in a bone nose
<br>says Sidalia Saddleweigher, frond fancier 
<br>member of the Empty Elbow Gang, simperer through 
<br>maybe the Empty Olson Gang? 
<br>don't reveal yourself

<p>Stymy your hour of walling loose 
<br>I have kept the catch cap from all luckiness 
<br>saith Parusha, collector of rum babas 
<br>hangings of old skin in the shade 
<br>a wormless haunt of zeros 
<br>and the streaming slant

<p>Can I borrow Betty Carioca for one hour?

<p>Ballwinder in stiffly positions 
<br>the octet he had, had dumped 
<br>a Caruso of the barber stone 
<br>so wholly

<p>The man who was a buzzer in a doorway 
<br>the one who drained a silver pea 
<br>what was his?

<p>Cologen in peals, whose name will you take? 
<br>whose then can you shake? 
<br>Byron

<p>Copycat Wheel of the whole hallway 
<br>he was wide, I think he was cash fed 
<br>how many Waltons can fit inside?

<p>Vauntrot Newmoony 
<br>a Necessiter

<p>Rhodochrosite Rose remained veined in the box 
<br>its symmetry box 
<br>its elephantine contender 
<br>with the curtains 
<br>with a weigher 
<br>Phyllis was the number of its composition

<p>Elfman in a disco nightmare 
<br>I heard his bubbles screaming 
<br>lower the loaves, the symmetry sun 
<br>descend to print the meat 
<br>pretend to cuff the newt

<p>Elbow Winder, come down 
<br>here, seat 
<br>come unfraught 
<br>I have come plumb affair

<br>or prove with tooth depending 
<br>magus with an empty tack 
<br>unemployed later by Cargyle Heavy Liquids

<p>The Vitamin Whelmer 
<br>collapsed into a Betty Pager 
<br>limp tongue, bygone fair 
<br>coframed with the Emaline Lister 
<br>where you typecase fences and do come on

<p>Neverpayman, the named one 
<br>Barcalounger the Misanthrope, a tuck in it 
<br>Berry Eats, my haut-laugh reconnoiter 
<br>Barberry Bill, the ointed mill 
<br>placement to call back and sap you

<p>Greg Lake opens a rockshop in Half Lake 
<br>a flat top, he removes the bra 
<br>on the crowdside with more than a licking sky

<p>Harmolimiter, Backsfondteller, Amounted Mick 
<br>we'll all go off and remove roads 
<br>with the soda burn to catch up again

<p>Keats Flanagan at the fraud base 
<br>as if they were all millers and we put them 
<br>the door went in and here came the Dogsbottom from Remulak 
<br>Bullawayo Killowatt, the Thoughtbroader 
<br>Ormaviluant Pose, the Homonid Goal

<p>Crawl, the Eleusinian Damagehound, takes his house 
<br>you must study it all through the carbon variations 
<br>a bit big to indulge, free on a nail 
<br>Surinam Dabbler voted it 
<br>you took a bridge course?
 
<p>Ma Violence had her own practice cage 
<br>the Lord of All Gone Fallow fancies 
<br>Mataculture brims, Maneuvian sticks 
<br>slat weights that were slate picks 
<br>Pendulo Galoroofian, he's in 
<br>a practitioner's cape, marble 
<br>to the ankles in skis 
<br>those pinned-up glasspenny dooms

<p>Kid Landover roars, he ventilates 
<br>works with the everything nothing ends up with 
<br>Delila Borovate taking a hunch and bending at the slight 
<br>sash doubling as bell key of take in stumble friend 
<br>I don't know where you're going all this hollow from 
<br>the car ripped at the horn capped it

<p>Too many elementary names, street frontal 
<br>to end this book, a clearing of the nose ends 
<br>in circular stasis, Geek Electroid on a walking pin 
<br>he practices pinching caps and Walter Cellars 
<br>naps

<p>Tooted up berated I waltzed too many sands 
<br>a beard not the hen's common width from a breath 
<br>calling Jawbrad from Babyville, North Coulee 
<br>there the membranes were sailed 
<br>he stood with Sally Bendrow and vamped 
<br>there were Negroes and a shot of the sun 
<br>made it look like Abner Can had bunked in late 
<br>but, man, the blue vein of those hose-on flatteries 
<br>planked to Sodus Death, mere lamp from the ash 
<br>post causing me

<p>Organ Powerdad had launched his laces and limped away 
<br>dog gone, little to speak, a punchboard under his take 
<br>blond and unavailing his dynamite, his teak rose 
<br>then Brandon strolled and unhitched the team 
<br>polution of shovels, apparition of holiday
 
<p>Armenian Ones, the variable touchtoes 
<br>free radical tag team tormentors, Sluggos 
<br>of gall radiance you could hear the cheering 
<br>the chaining to a rag marked Mop Drain 
<br>they were good polished soap horses 
<br>mounts of silence, those doubled ones

<p>Visitacion Apted, slow down 
<br>curl your glows and raise haste beyond 
<br>violet little doll wheels embrace 
<br>find the Victorian dormers in all their 
<br>fine down the nation into 
<br>prenatalize the pumpkins

<p>Agateman as the Son of Sam rises

<p>Carniverous Pearhawker stumbles, bunches

<p>Stirrup Don Amity folds

<p>Tomatoes into tourmalines, Bedroom Eric sizes

<p>You may have rust on your lapel but the Doubleyou Duck 
<br>remains at your arrest, undertongue depressed 
<br>there are windows in Radar Barn prism facings of RKO USA 
<br>and a lunch on every hip will stop all these streets 
<br>--The Preluded Parker

<p>A router, Bumabner Paul 
<br>A router, Pianissimo Highwayman 
<br>A router, the collector with the clock missing 
<br>A router, Adarmo Pad

<p>Would you mortgage his army with a gum eraser 
<br>Permanente Doll?
 
<p>Marble Dando is not the name of anything

<p>Flash Coolihan, the Hamadryad Bactrian 
<br>or kneedeep bouncer from Limerick 
<br>Closed

<p>Insouciance of the Steed, that's a name

<p>Billy Neuter was a hod carrier, no, a nose thief, no, 
<br>a rod of justice, no, bartender in a wheat row hallway, no, 
<br>the embolism at the end of your cow, no, a veer, 
<br>no, there is no resemblance to this name

<p>We sit in a transparent green room and view 
<br>Heady Carrier 
<br>there is nothing on the floor but a new dog 
<br>and nothing further to say but amplitude

<p>Berigmo Clahm, or Clam, an outing father

<br>Troxy Nowhere stems from the goods, brings 
<br>letters appearing out of a brown-out

<p>Hear me, Flattenyard, maybe 
<br>the fragmentary is getting to me 
<br>the call of inebriation a kind of horse seam 
<br>these calipers fell from 
<br>Woolybear 
<br>a whole nation eating late then

<p>Everybody there was a delicate crew
<br>The Down Boys meet The Drown Girls
<br>a wicked weed strutting normalcy
<br>The Born Boys and The Brawn Girls 
<br>lead-in no good but the socket's OK 
<br>everybody known was down there

<p>Shud Bank and Goody Benman 
<br>held up the accuracy at Bart Penetralium 
<br>there's a collapse to what's loose on your pages 
<br>Montrohixamene and its slippery residues 
<br>we're new for a beaut one 
<br>or trains beyond fences to go unnumbered

<p>Stop it stop it I'm not hiring you Prixene 
<br>bountiful vein the real stuff is the cancel it latent 
<br>castoff accuracy wanders clarity turnfront 
<br>Bud's whole ball of hinders let's frame 
<br>the lentil input of Luddy startles me 
<br>to start the hall bulb with gardening tines 
<br>Adrian Wines

<p>At the collapse of all waiters we'll rattle on 
<br>starring the Colostomy Waders and sundry partials on the pat

<p>A Wailaway Fastener more mordant hydrant 
<br>thermocouple uproariant Normo,  we moved 
<br>harpy frustralian idle loom form of tackle 
<br>Cardamon Follower the hinge boot 
<br>manacle me up and out, a major short

<p>Flagon Puppy hitched to the corn moon 
<br>bore reacted, stumpy inch well 
<br>Hightail Mason of the Canyon routed 
<br>the bums have been ousted in the sun they were born in
<br>tangle trip leveled, doubted, double doubted

<p>Shot out a whole rasher of mains, Sailor Soon 
<br>stiff hoped the picture to Brain Else 
<br>caged up a very 
<br>alfalfa mist stone, an age game 
<br>this is the Peristaltic Rialto 
<br>one they bury snow

<p>He burned the gate case in swell of Herms

<p>Soolidat Farmworker monkeyed on the bevel 
<br>and I am in the march of it all barely 
<br>horizon hoisted the tiny parkers you see 
<br>Song of the Carkeys they say he was mental 
<br>conditional care on the float

<p>Kind of thin this side of Hades 
<br>Partitionment Syndrome calling all foxes 
<br>Haidy Boy is here, representative, sinking 
<br>I see his camp, a single thigh 
<br>thought shot

<p>Brandythorn Appetizer, lore of the shovel 
<br>a born lister he covered it, plural 
<br>forget his name, hear his lingo 
<br>thematic travel double closed and thumbing 
<br>a cork in the mist

<p>Wester Petrel and Hiram Weight flip 
<br>and you get a wet green lantern on the other side 
<br>snow is coming off as not that good of a decal 
<br>but Wester and Hiram lead Manhattan by the wrists 
<br>and so you will catch them

<p>A plastic container, Will 
<br>and we're in trouble 
<br>with the timing chain blues
		 
<p>Chronic Aches, a Bandonian Setback, left me open

<p>He was a thrill killer but bungled his deeds
<br>Amato Smudgeon

<p>You lit when you turned me?
<br>I am Bellyglo Imitation, I am Was 
<br>of the Defter Tunes

<p>A group called the Creole Barkays skipped much 
<br>better than Sunset Snap 
<br>Cried Want and the Millenarians 
<br>striped mouth by barged clockway

<p>I kept trying to break through into the park where they fired
<br>Cubby's Blanks

<p>Simoleons 
<br>plunged through the Dart Car 
<br>Clad Wool Buriers 
<br>are you threatening me?

<p>Dog enters bar car, young 
<br>glass, impressions and gangles 
<br>Starly Hoipner is food 
<br>to the stupors he hoses

<p>There are Poofs, Pfuis

<p>Sonic Tooth and Trend Deposit 
<br>someone has listened to the Emetic Nun 
<br>triple your hollows and bell up on sound 
<br>this is Divots Day
		 
<p>The Slut of the Normandy Coast is acting in this compartment 
<br>how so?

<p>The Brunt of It All composing and discommoding 
<br>the part and its parts 
<br>wallet, hand, thumbnail corrector 
<br>I am the load of my own insufferance 
<br>grumbled

<p>The high wind at the torque spot 
<br>I see this without connectors 
<br>shell-less, inflated with remove 
<br>does this jet in the direction of Everything Named? 
<br>I carry you away from all coasts

<p>Larval Man brims to his hand 
<br>Kalimba Ramus or Vedic Columbine 
<br>whatever the route it rained out of spite 
<br>be sure

<p>This is becoming something I hadn't wanted 
<br>a nimbus finally nameless 
<br>must I give up the utter moniker? 
<br>the onyx bracelet in the silent bell tower

<p>The man with the name washed in the empty water
