        The beat<br>
        Comes out the speaker<br>
        Bodies start to move<br>
        Yearning to be<br>
        Next to leaning<br>
        On some other body<br>
        They get up to dance<br>
        Couples a common <br>
        Denominator although<br>
        A few threes and fours<br>
        Can be seen <br>
        Around the floor<br>
        Spines showing through<br>
        Clothes take on<br>
        Unearthly glow<br>
        As if all things<br>
        Unthought of when<br>
        In the course of events<br>
        Have surfaced<br>
        Having a good time<br>
        Between songs<br>
        Everyone stands around<br>
        Breathing saying <br>
        To each other<br>
        What fun<br>
        Is the next one fast or slow<br>
        Can I have this dance<br>

        STRAIGHT ON BEARING LEFT</strong><br>
        <br>
        skies skid into Baghdad<br>
        out of my mind copied, pieced<br>
        together, studied and translated<br>
        they get their oil from a &#8216;well&#8217;<br>
        as likable as chinese writing systems<br>
        I grasp and share, like a popping beacon<br>
        the complete experience of the sky&#8217;s members<br>
        whose i.d. cards are clouds<br>
        (see conditions inside) adn how they bend<br>
        A lulls B into seeing D<br>
        R loves S but hates you<br>
        Z snores as Y marks the spot with X<br>
        ledge ages dawdle, and rush,<br>
        as I pull plug out, and rug E<br>

        AIRY 
        RUSHES PUNCH</strong><br>
        <br>
        Airy rushes punch my shirt<br>
        Through a window of sunset dirt<br>
        And send me reeling like a lure<br>
        Through the water nerves of America<br>
        Once on the other side of somewhere<br>
        I relax and become someone else<br>
        Not that I behave different<br>
        Just behave less often<br>
        The sky offers me solace and office space<br>
        And stars I keep in drawers<br>
        Wear nothing<br>
        But a little mist and halo<br>
        I will imagine myself<br>
        A sympathetic headlight<br>
        Knocking on the door of the night<br>
        To borrow a cup of sugar <br>
        From the beautiful neighbor <br>
        Who&#8217;s moved in <br>
        Without even the clothes on her back<br>
        &#8220;Would it be possible<br>
        To borrow a cup of sugar&#8221;<br>
        &#8220;Sure Sit down, honey<br>
        Make yourself comfortable&#8221;<br>
        I ease into the big dipper<br>

        COMPLETE BALANCING WEATHER MEETS</strong><br>
        <br>
        Complete balancing weather meets<br>
        With the eye of complete off-balance brain<br>
        Tottering through verbs<br>
        Dew covers the shoe<br>
        With minute observations<br>
        Piling up in an organic unity life chair and sitter<br>
        Dog floats in and pipe slipper and paper<br>
        Sits partly over the instep of unshorn foot<br>
        Snores like a saw through the glories of news logs<br>
        The reader soon falls his head down in bliss<br>
        Or is it a sleep without dreams<br>
        In a city where the nose<br>
        Comes occasionally to a water-smelling patch of haze<br>
        On the face<br>
        Moving toward the river in a phrase<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><br>
        SEATED ON THE BACK</strong><br>
        <br>
        Seated on the back of my boat<br>
        Fanning evening into my face<br>
        My thoughts travel<br>
        Across the river<br>
        To the little town starting to light<br>
        Yesterday I was over there<br>
        Walking the streets<br>
        Saying &#8220;Hey!&#8221; to neighbors and friends<br>
        What are they doing now<br>
        Coming home from work<br>
        Kissing hello<br>
        Sitting to supper<br>
        Spending time with the old lady and kids<br>
        Watching the news<br>
        I have a hunch I&#8217;ll never know<br>
        In the cabin<br>
        I&#8217;ve enough food for two<br>
        Some books to take my mind away<br>
        And a bed sleeping two<br>
        The moon&#8217;s high enough now<br>
        To extend a toothpick of light<br>
        Across the water<br>
        For me to pick my teeth<br>
        A gurgling and humming pacifies<br>
        My lips<br>
        As I prepare for bed<br>
        Listening to fingers<br>
        Humming off the ends<br>
        Of the arms of the chiar<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>THE BOOK I TOSS</strong><br>
        <br>
        The book I toss is Boss<br>
        It bangs against the walls<br>
        And gets me working<br>
        I watch the thin green<br>
        Recede into a reed<br>
        And think the time right <br>
        To set the Boss right<br>
        We argue<br>
        Cops suddenly appear<br>
        I throw them and Boss<br>
        Out the window<br>
        And unscrew my ankles<br>
        I be my own boss<br>
        I be my own police<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><br>
        LAST FIVE MINUTES</strong><br>
        <br>
        The long and the short<br>
        Of it is<br>
        I have to keep pushing<br>
        I feel myself<br>
        Pushing against the <br>
        Lead-in to beauty<br>
        And take a hunch through<br>
        With me<br>
        Into the halls<br>
        Where the everyday<br>
        Seems like eternity<br>
        There&#8217;s no fooling around<br>
        About something <br>
        As serious <br>
        As it is beautiful<br>
        There&#8217;s no match<br>
        For the feeling<br>
        That gets there<br>
        When I get there<br>
        And absolutely no sense<br>
        Of duration<br>
        And no telling<br>
        How everything turns out<br>
        <strong><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </strong> <strong><br>
        WHIFF</strong><br>
        <br>
        An evening<br>
        Spent talking<br>
        Spent thinking<br>
        About what my life would be<br>
        If I&#8217;d stayed <br>
        With a particular girl or woman<br>
        I went with<br>
        What would be <br>
        If I&#8217;d&#8217;ve been accepted to and gone<br>
        Where I applied<br>
        To a different school<br>
        Than the one I did<br>
        Where I&#8217;d learned<br>
        Different social graces<br>
        Then the ones I have<br>
        Where some of the material<br>
        Values of the American dream<br>
        Had rubbed off<br>
        Enough to make me<br>
        Live it out<br>
        In the good-works sense<br>
        If I&#8217;d settled down<br>
        And settled<br>
        For the foundation <br>
        On a house<br>
        For future generations<br>
        Instead of assuming<br>
        Immediately past generations<br>
        My foundation to mine<br>
        If I&#8217;d been<br>
        A little quicker to learn<br>
        What was expected of me<br>
        And wanting to please pleased<br>
        Going on that way<br>
        Through all eternity<br>
        I&#8217;ve probably been saved<br>
        From mere routines<br>
        By a streak of stubbornness<br>
        By a slow mind<br>
        And tendency to drift<br>
        By an emotional development<br>
        That requires<br>
        My personal understanding<br>
        Before happening<br>
        Feeling out the implications<br>
        An emotion has in<br>
        Form of expectation<br>
        Before trying out and<br>
        After awareness<br>
        I sense a willingness<br>
        To tell someone<br>
        I know and like<br>
        And sense the same from <br>
        Anything they&#8217;d like to know<br>
        About me<br>
        And, at the same time, have<br>
        A vast sense of privacy<br>
        Which means<br>
        There&#8217;s no way<br>
        I&#8217;ll wear out my personality<br>
        And its sense of continuity<br>
        Although sometimes<br>
        I feel empty<br>
        But talking to<br>
        Someone I like<br>
        And trust<br>
        And sense the same from<br>
        I feel way up<br>
        And after a long evening<br>
        Of talk about this and that<br>
        Feel wide awake<br>
        And feel the world<br>
        Wide and awake around me<br>
        And have a visual intensity<br>
        In memory<br>
        That, in near memory, dulls<br>
        And throbs<br>
        And grows vivid as hell<br>
        When I bring it to mind<br>
        Some time from then<br>
        What my life<br>
        Would&#8217;ve been like<br>
        Under different circumstances<br>
        Would&#8217;ve been different<br>
        With its own<br>
        Attendant ifs<br>
        And its own what-might&#8217;ve-been<br>
        But this way<br>
        I&#8217;ve elected to follow<br>
        And cast my vote<br>
        Each waking day in<br>
        I avoid<br>
        The possibility<br>
        Of taking the past too seriously<br>
        Or feeling any bitterness<br>
        Or sadness<br>
        This way<br>
        When my ship comes in<br>
        I&#8217;ll&#8217;ve passed out of mind<br>
        Beyond the sight of land<br>
        And won&#8217;t hesitate <br>
        For a second<br>
        To look back on all this<br>
        With fondness or remiss<br>
        The air&#8217;ll be clear<br>
        The moon&#8217;ll be there<br>
        And you, whoever<br>
        You are and hope to be,<br>
        Will be here with my love<br>
        <br>
