          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2"><b>The following article was published in the August 
              1992 issue of <i>Poetry Flash</i>, number 233.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I first came 
              upon Myung Mi Kim's work when she was named guest editor of <i>HOW(ever)</i>, 
              a publication of experimental feminist literature founded by Kathleen 
              Fraser, Beverly Dahlen, and Frances Jaffer in San Francisco. I immediately 
              had expectations. Having an interest in Asian American literature, 
              I was anxious to read a poetry collection by a Korean American woman. 
              Also having an interest in experimental poetry, I wanted to see 
              how Kim's poetics has developed within the forum of modern feminist 
              poetry. But mostly I wanted to see where the cultural and experimental 
              factors would intersect in Kim's poems.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Conscious of 
              my bias, I wanted to give Kim's <i>Under Flag</i> a fair reading. 
              Further, I wanted to give her poems a fair hearing. Ideally the 
              textual combined with the aural is what sets poetry apart from prose. 
              And it is always illuminating to compare and contrast the experiences 
              of both the reading and the hearing of a poet's work.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">First the text. 
              The cover of <i>Under Flag</i> is made up of abstract artwork - 
              two untitled woodcut paintings by Norine Nishimura. I thought this 
              was a good invitation: but I came upon a familiar barrier. The back 
              cover of the book has a quote from Kathleen Fraser which describes 
              Kim's book as:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">... 
                an assemblage of on-going effacements in the life of a child and 
                her family under occupation by American forces in Korea and, later, 
                in her struggle to enter an alien language and culture in the 
                U.S. Not since Oppen, has the eroding presence of war on the wholeness 
                of human existence been so vividly located ...</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The quote does 
              what all good 'blurbs' should do by encapsulating a book's theme 
              or themes in a manner that is brief, concise and that deliberately 
              encourages or discourages a potential reader or audience. But for 
              better or for worse, the text is framed for its readers by a conventional 
              if not convenient context. In Kim's case, <i>Under Flag</i> is cast 
              into the social, cultural, and political foray. In reference to 
              George Oppen's name, Kim's book is given its post-modernist marker. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Many of Kim's 
              poems open with muted but compelling images which spring off of 
              their titles, as in this excerpt where she wistfully (ironically) 
              recalls the most arduous moments of her childhood, learning a new 
              language:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font size="2">And

                would the sea be, if we were near it</font></p>

                and it is sound in time ... (p. 13)</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The single, 
              double and triple line spacings appear on the page as if to give 
              the poem a time signature the way quarter, half and whole notes 
              are scored on a staff of music. In the opening lines there is a 
              triangulation of the short &quot;i&quot; vowel sounds when &quot;ring,&quot; 
              &quot;sing,&quot; and &quot;it&quot; are interspersed, while &quot;must&quot; 
              is intoned both as a question and as an imperative.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The consonant 
              'n', is given the same attention in lines three and four. The hard 
              'in' in &quot;span&quot; and &quot;even&quot; is set against the 
              soft in &quot;yawning&quot; and &quot;distance,&quot; almost to 
              escape the necessity of an article. In the fifth line, the long 
              'e' vowel wounds are crowded together. Kim's use of vowels and consonants 
              give musical distinction to lines that can threaten the limits of 
              syntax.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Throughout 
              the book, Kim's sense of lyricism seems to counteract its content. 
              The fragmented imagery sheds light on both the personal and the 
              historical subjugation of country, culture, gender and race. The 
              pieces are held together like the details in a large classical Korean 
              landscape painting, as in the book's title poem:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font size="2">Under

              are moments in the book where the luminous becomes dull, especially 
              in the longer poems. In &quot;Food, Shelter, Clothing,&quot; it 
              is hard to negotiate the narrative no matter how much desire there 
              is to place or read into the text; the poetic voice is unsustained:</font></p>

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I went to hear 
              Myung Mi Kim read from Under Flag at three different venues: at 
              a book party and reception in a private residence overlooking the 
              Oakland Hills; at Cody's Books in Berkeley; and at the Japanese 
              Cultural Center in San Francisco sponsored by the Kearny Street 
              Workshop and Small Press Traffic. At all three events she was introduced 
              as, &quot;...Korean American ... she came to the United States at 
              age nine ...&quot; This kind of introduction is honorific. But again, 
              for better or worse, Kim's work was framed for the audience by its 
              ethnicity. And each time she was introduced, she tried to steer 
              the audience away from framing her book ethnically - almost as a 
              disclaimer. &quot;My work isn't so much about the immigrant story,&quot; 
              Kim said, &quot;as it is about <i>how</i> that experience is <i>branded</i> 
              or <i>imprinted</i> on the language of the poems.&quot; [paraphrased] 
              I think her statement expresses both the desire and predicament 
              of Asian American poets and writers today.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some of her 
              poems need to be read aloud as in the following excerpt from &quot;Demarcation,&quot; 
              which is charming on the page and sweet to the ear when Kim sings 
              the motifs from a Korean folksong:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <pre><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">
A bird calls out in perfect thirds: do-mi, do-mi


Domi, domi, saal zsin domi
Domi, domi, oh fat snapper             As complicated as it is


As dirt scrubbed off that a thousand hands smear on

       It is like - it is like - (p. 38)
</font>

</pre>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In her readings, 
              Kim never read from the series of six poems called &quot;These Fishing.&quot; 
              Perhaps they are no longer current or relevant to Kim. Or perhaps 
              from the time of their writing to the time of publication they seem 
              less vital to her. But I think they are the most elegant pieces 
              in the book. Visually they look like the five line English translations 
              of Chinese lyrics from the Tang Dynasty that I grew up reading as 
              a child. Filled with intriguing elements, their visual simplicity 
              is deceiving. For example, &quot;These Fishing Six&quot;:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">As 
                soldiers of this great enterprise</font></p>

                one thread to bring next to needle eye (p. 42)</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first two 
              lines of this short poem represent the determination and the anxiety 
              of a boat full of immigrants as they approach the waters of a new 
              land. With the third line we wonder who of the many will take on 
              a new name; who of the many will hold steadfast to their name? And 
              whose name lingers that is left behind? The images shattered by 
              the fourth line. The possessive and interrogative &quot;whose&quot; 
              and &quot;what&quot; are counterintuitive in relation to the words 
              that follow. The poem as a unit presents many possibilities that 
              are, to name a few, 1) syntactical, 2) phonological and/or cultural, 
              3) perceptual, and 4) metaphorical.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Syntactically, 
              we read the fourth line and try to rearrange the words (in our own 
              mind) as an organized thought if not an actual sentence. For instance, 
              one rearrangement of the third and fourth lines might read as, &quot;their 
              names linger / as the focus of an eye upon a needle to be threaded.&quot; 
              There could be many variations on this phrase as we try to reconcile 
              the infinitive &quot;to bring&quot; without the benefit of a true 
              verb to clearly indicate the subject / predicate function of the 
              phrase in light of the three preceeding lines. This is only one 
              example of how we can read a text that may at first seem unsurmountable.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Phonologically, 
              we wonder what motivated or generated an utterance like the fourth 
              line? Is it random association? Or is it a product of a flashback 
              and suppressed memory? It certainly violates the left-to-right assumptions 
              of logic that we have for text in standard English. For me, the 
              fourth line as a lyric quality that seems to be inherently Asian 
              American. It is reminiscent of my seventy-three year old mother's 
              language and how ti changes around the holidays. She might spend 
              a week with my aunties speaking in Ilocano. And then she might teach 
              my five year old niece how to mend a sock speaking in English. She 
              might say, &quot;<i>anaco</i>, take one thread to bring next to 
              needle eye, <i>kasta</i>, like that!&quot; My niece would not find 
              it necessary to correct her syntax. She would understand the directional 
              gaze of her <i>lola's</i> eyes, mirror her gestures, follow her 
              fingerings and engage the task. The sock would be mended. And the 
              song-like quality of her <i>lola's</i> phrases would become part 
              of her linguistic repertoire. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perceptually, 
              the last word in the poem plays off of our ability to focus on an 
              image. Is the &quot;eye&quot; in the poem the eye of the needle 
              or the human eye of the subject? Is the needle an object &quot;next 
              to&quot; the eye? Or is &quot;to needle&quot; an infinitive with 
              an indirect object? On first reading and in subsequent readings, 
              our perception changes with the text.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am not implying 
              that a specific linguistic strategy is required of us to appreciate 
              the poem. But I am suggesting that we let our eyes and ears play 
              with the language both as text and as music. Metaphorically, this 
              poem represents the necessity and perniciousness of the immigration 
              endeavor and how it is pulled by many forces between opposing shores.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The most centered 
              reading that Kim gave was at the Japanese Cultural Center. As all 
              events sponsored by the Kearny Street Workshop, the atmosphere was 
              'tribal' - sipping juice or wine, selling books, introducing family 
              and friends and chatting with the artists beforehand. The audience 
              was highly receptive. And her opening remarks were different. It 
              was the first appeareance at which she felt comfortable enough to 
              dedicate the reading to her father. She explained that after coming 
              to the United States at age nine, her father was killed in an auto 
              accident when she was fourteen. The painful irony of that story 
              is not in the book. But the emotional impact of that experience 
              as it is imprinted on her poetic language is most present. I looked 
              at the book once again; the first page of <i>Under Flag</i> is inscribed, 
              &quot;for Young Ok Kim (1922-1972).&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The music of 
              poetic language comes from a core more deep than we can sometimes 
              imagine. And we are amazed to emerge from the perplexities of our 
              losses as the &quot;bluegill&quot; (quite literally, a lyric symbol) 
              peeps out of difficult lines.</font></p>

              and sings as we desire.</font><br>
