      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> At a reading Myung 
          Mi Kim gave on November 2, 2001 at SUNY-Buffalo, a member of the audience 
          asked a question about the connection between Kim's ethnic background 
          and her poetry in words to this effect: Given your visible Otherness, 
          are you trying to reclaim your Koreanness, or to dwell in English? Kim 
          replied that her poetry was about the impossibility of either. This 
          essay explores the possibilities that are opened up for Kim's poetry 
          as a result of this impossible position of either reclaiming a seemingly 
          stable ethnic identity, or seeking to be at home in the dominant language. 
          For Kim, an oppositional position constricted by an &quot;either-or 
          proposition&quot; is incapable of addressing the complexity in the process 
          of bringing social, political, and aesthetic change. The fact that &quot;we're 
          each implicated in a machinery that works to maintain the loci of power,&quot; 
          Kim notes, makes it even more necessary &quot;to pose how we might participate 
          in inventing how 'change' takes place.&quot; As a poet seeking to be 
          a shaping force in the way change takes place, Kim believes that &quot;Poetry 
          is simply how you participate in language [. . .]&quot; (Morrison 75, 
          77). Language in Kim's poems is a site for destabilizing ethnic and 
          national identities, for interrogating power relations, and for articulating 
          an irreducible alterity that resists assimilation. &quot;It's the locating 
          of one's own condition by agency of a text,&quot; says Kim in an interview, 
          &quot;that is so profound&quot; (Morrison 81). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In her poems about 
          the Korean immigrant experience collected in her first volume, <i>Under 
          Flag</i> (1991), Kim investigates the diasporic subjects' relationship 
          to language, history, and U.S. citizenship. She interrogates the encounters 
          between cultures and languages, including the ways in which language 
          reproduces or unsettles power relations. Her rendering of English with 
          foreign accents dislodges binary constructs of cultural and national 
          identities which assume essence, fixity, and hierarchy. Interweaving 
          her investigation of language with an exploration of collective memory 
          and history, Kim examines what she refers to as &quot;the questions 
          of translation between cultures and languages and in particular the 
          kinds of resemblances and contaminations that inform how language(s) 
          systematize and engender notions of power&quot; (Lee 94). She employs 
          what might be called a language of diaspora, whose other-sounding music 
          transforms the prosodic structure of traditional English lyric, making 
          the English language &quot;shift,&quot; putting it &quot;to flight,&quot; 
          to borrow Gilles Deleuze and Claire Parnet's terms and concept (58). 
          In their discussion of marginalized and subjugated people's relationship 
          to the English language, Deleuze and Parnet note that it is precisely 
          by being &quot;a hegemonic, imperialistic language [. . .]&quot; that 
          English &quot;is all the more vulnerable to the subterranean workings 
          of languages and dialects which undermine it from all sides and impose 
          on it a play of vast corruptions and variations.&quot; This subversive 
          and creative &quot;shift&quot; in a hegemonic language, they contend, 
          also characterizes official American English: &quot;The American language 
          bases its despotic official pretensions, its majoritarian claim to hegemony, 
          only on its extraordinary capacity for being twisted and shattered and 
          for secretly putting itself in the service of minorities who work it 
          from inside, [. . .] nibbling away at that hegemony as it extends itself 
          [. . .]&quot; (58). To corrupt the hegemonic language from within is 
          precisely Kim's strategy. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In fact, Kim materializes 
          immigrants' experience of disjunctive time in terms of &quot;speed, 
          &quot;duration,&quot; and &quot;music&quot; in the English language 
          inflected with &quot;foreign&quot; accents. In the opening poem of <i>Under 
          Flag</i> &quot;And Sing We,&quot; Kim uses displaced English words to 
          enact Korean immigrants' fragmentary memories of home, including the 
          &quot;Um-pah, um-pah sensibility of the first grade teacher&quot; and 
          the sound from &quot;feet firm on the pump organ's pedals,&quot; pumping 
          water into rice fields (14). At the same time, she explores the possibilities 
          of what Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari call &quot;the deterritorialization 
          of language,&quot; opposing &quot;a purely intensive usage of language 
          to all symbolic or even significant or simply signifying usage of it&quot;(<i>Kafka 
          </i>18,19). By making such intensive use of both English and Korean, 
          Kim is able to oppose the &quot;oppressive quality&quot; of either language 
          and to arrive at the kind of &quot;perfect and unformed expression, 
          a material intense expression&quot; which Deleuze and Guattari refer 
          to when speaking of the deterritorialization of Yiddish and German in 
          Kafka's writings (<i>Kafka</i> 27, 25, 19). Kim's use of language as 
          such articulates the immigrants' memory of home and sense of dislocation 
          in a land where they can no longer trace their ancestry. As she invents 
          a new prosody in English to render the experience of diaspora visceral 
          through verbal sound not identifiable with any single system of language, 
          Kim allows immigrants to confront their feelings of exile and the process 
          of their becoming. Indeed, Kim employs what Deleuze and Guartari might 
          call &quot;deterritorialized sounds&quot; (<i>Kafka</i> 26) to destabilize 
          national and cultural identities:</font></p>

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With what used 
          to be familiar noises of prattle in the kitchen displaced, &quot;we&quot; 
          find the songs we hear no longer identifiable with a common ancestry 
          or language, as we realize we are not the pioneers in the land where 
          we live now. The singing of London Bridge (or perhaps some other structure) 
          &quot;falling down falling down&quot; is interrupted by a different 
          song with a disparate rhythm and cadence: &quot;Callback fallback whip 
          whippoorwill.&quot; Both are intersected by yet another song of a different 
          music, &quot;trundle rondo.&quot; This singular music &quot;trundle 
          rondo&quot; has become part of a heterogeneous assemblage of songs, 
          in which each maintains its distinctiveness. These songs are markers 
          of time, diaspora, and duration of memories, not traceable to a single 
          source of nation or ethnicity. As immigrants' cultural identities lose 
          their traceable origins in a land where they can claim no &quot;natural&quot; 
          bond through lineage, their otherness contaminates the dominant language 
          and disturbs the cultural homogeneity of the U.S. nation-space. Refusing 
          to be defined as the opposite of the norm by Orientalist discourse, 
          or reduced to the Same by assimilationist ideology, the alterity of 
          diaspora subjects in Kim's poems at once resists and intervenes in the 
          dominant culture even as immigrants themselves are being transformed 
          in the process of becoming. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Kim's poems also 
          break away from linear, chronological time in expressing immigrants' 
          experience of dislocation and becoming with regards to collective and 
          individual identities. In her collage composition, time as duration 
          of articulation and memory is intersected by national history and the 
          history of colonialism and imperialism. Kim interweaves markings of 
          time as geographical and cultural displacements through polyphonic articulation 
          that resists any &quot;regularizing, maintainable 'pattern', &quot; 
          to borrow Kim's own words ( &quot;Anacrusis&quot; par. 2). Like the 
          other-sounding English, the multidimensional time and disjunctive simultaneity 
          in Kim's poetry open up the textual space not simply to the social, 
          historical, and political, but also to the unutterable, the silenced 
          and erased. In &quot;Food, Shelter, Clothing,&quot; the speaking voices 
          follow the trajectory of refugees' and immigrants' diaspora, while shifting 
          from one historical moment to another. Using blank spaces on the page 
          and fragmentary utterances, Kim creates a sense of disruption, isolation, 
          and exile, which is intertwined with Korean history, including the Korean 
          War, the Japanese invasion, and Korean resistance. This method enables 
          Kim to bring into her poem a remarkable range of geographical locations 
          and historical moments as well. Take for example, the arrangement of 
          these lines on one page, and their juxtaposition with the lines on the 
          opposite page: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote>

              to cross the ocean<br>

          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Leaving the rest 
          of the page blank, Kim uses incomplete sentences on the opposite page 
          to evoke two historical events-the landing of the amphibious tanks of 
          U.S. military in South Korea on September 28, 1950 at the &quot;same 
          spot&quot; where Japanese invading armies had landed before. The arrival 
          of the U.S. amphibious tanks marks the beginning of the Korean War and 
          an unequal relationship between U.S. and South Korea; the landing of 
          the Japanese invading armies in Korea led to the brutal colonization 
          of Korea by Japan from 1910 to 1945. Although the U.S. military presence 
          in Korea was motivated by purposes vastly different from those of the 
          Japanese military campaigns, it also brought massive destruction and 
          countless deaths to Korea:</font></p>

          by her engagement with historical events of war, colonization, and diaspora, 
          which are external, though not unconnected, to language and poetry. 
          It is precisely through her engagement with the world and historical 
          moments by pushing the limits or extremities of language that Kim finds 
          new creative possibilities for articulating what seems impossible to 
          articulate. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Speaking of the 
          writings by Paul Celan and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Kim notes that the 
          space where the &quot;collaboration between the impossibility of utterance 
          and finding the means by which to utter&quot; is in &quot;constant motion, 
          and constant reshaping of itself&quot; (Morrison 81-82). She adds, &quot;any 
          poem is always on the cusp of coming into legibility-formally, psychically, 
          politically. For me those works that keep re-invigorating that space 
          of silence and erasure, the space of the seemingly untranslatable, are 
          the ones in which you connect to a source of endurance and power&quot; 
          (Morrison 82). The empty spaces left on the page, and the spaces among 
          words, sentences, and images in this and other poems by Kim are spaces 
          which articulate silence and erasure resulting from massacre-&quot;An 
          ambulance on which the words 'blood bank car' / Had been written in 
          blood&quot;- and from oppression by patriarchy and colonization-&quot;She 
          could not talk without first looking at others' mouths (which language?) 
          / (pushed into ) crevice a bluegill might lodge in&quot; (<i>Under Flag</i> 
          24, 21). These spaces also mark the process in which this poem, &quot;Food, 
          Shelter, Clothing,&quot; is coming into legibility, moving from one 
          fragmented image to another, from interrupted utterances to silence, 
          from silence to utterances, as fragmentary evocations of home and national 
          history give way to experiences of exile and diaspora. By re-invigorating 
          those spaces, Kim connects to &quot;a source of endurance and power&quot; 
          such as that found in the writings of Celan, Cha, Kafka, and Beckett, 
          as well as in the collective memory of Koreans' resistance to Japanese 
          invasion and colonization: &quot;These men these women are throwing 
          stones / These men these women chant and chant&quot; (<i>Under Flag</i> 
          25). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In her other poems 
          collected in <i>Under Flag</i> such as &quot;Body As One As History,&quot; 
          &quot;Demarcation,&quot; &quot;These Fishing,&quot; and &quot;From The 
          Sea On To the Land,&quot; cadences of deterritorialized words and deformations 
          of sentences engage with historical moments of violence, destruction, 
          and mass migration. Lyric utterances in these poems are intertwined 
          with experiences of diaspora and moments in Korean history. Kim's disjunctive 
          poetics denaturalizes national and ethnic identities, particularly Asian 
          Americans' essentialized bodily and cultural differences which were 
          used to justify their prohibition by law from becoming naturalized U.S. 
          citizens. In another poem, &quot;Into Such Assembly,&quot; for example, 
          Kim employs collage juxtaposition to expose the contradictions in the 
          process of being &quot;naturalized&quot; as a U.S. citizen, and to articulate 
          an alternative concept of belonging, which does not seek to erase difference 
          or reduce otherness. While relating the acquisition and usage of English 
          to state power in the process of assimilating the &quot;Other,&quot; 
          the first part of the poem simultaneously enacts and undermines the 
          official procedure of naturalizing aliens:</font></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
          In juxtaposition to this process of naturalization, Kim introduces a 
          passage of apparently Korean immigrants' nostalgic memories of home, 
          including a line of Korean song in Korean. </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">However, the images 
          of this home seem to be a typical Orientalist depiction of the East 
          frozen in time and space. The line from the Korean song-<i>Sunn-Bul-Sah, 
          geep eun bahm ae</i> (Deep into the night at the Temple of Becoming 
          the Buddha)-highlights this romanticized description of Korea isolated 
          from history. In contrast to this Orientalist construct of Korea, Kim's 
          references to Korea's colonization by Japan and to U.S. military and 
          political interventions in Korea, as well as Korean citizens' protests 
          against Japanese colonialism and American imperialism in the proceeding 
          poems, particularly the title poem, &quot;Under Flag,&quot; indicate 
          the impossibility for Korean immigrants to claim a stable, singular 
          identity of nation or culture. Kim foregrounds the ambivalence of Korean 
          immigrants' national and cultural identities in the provocative ending 
          lines of the first part of this poem:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Neither, neither</font></p>

              Who is mother tongue, who is father country? (<i>Under Flag</i> 
              29)</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The double negative 
          and the questions refuse the binarized choice of either this or that 
          category of national or cultural identification. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the second part 
          of this poem, Kim shows that a binary, hierarchical scheme of identity 
          construct of the American self and the Oriental Other is formulated 
          and maintained in terms of geographical locations. Using collage to 
          juxtapose different voices, Kim at once reveals and subverts such reductive 
          binary identity constructions:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Do they have

              we had a slateblue house with a flat roof where<br>
              I made many snowmen, over there (<i>Under Flag</i> 30)</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The emphasis on 
          geographical locations for defining ethnic and national identities in 
          these lines evokes the question raised in the opening poem of <i>Under 
          Flag</i>, &quot;And Sing We&quot;: &quot;Once we leave a place is it 
          there&quot; (14). While the dialogically juxtaposed questions and statements 
          suggest a mode of identity construction out of historical contexts, 
          but contained in an ethnically designated space fixed by geographical 
          boundaries. Kim challenges such spatially bounded and dichotomized identities 
          by introducing a passage of instructions for how to pronounce certain 
          English words: &quot;No, 'th', 'th', put your tongue against the roof 
          of your mouth, [. . .] that's better&quot; (<i>Under Flag</i> 30). This 
          passage reveals a power relation and identity reconstruction embedded 
          in the immigrants' relationship to the English language, indicating 
          a process of Korean immigrants' identity transformation in part through 
          learning a new language, a process which destabilizes spatially defined 
          identities of nation or culture.<br>
          </font></p>
        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Further exploring 
        Korean immigrants' experience of exile, dislocation, and becoming otherwise 
        than what they used to be or are supposed to be, Kim raises questions 
        about immigrants' relationships to mother tongue and dominant language. 
        As the speaker asks in the closing lines of Part Two of &quot;Into Such 
        Assembly&quot; : </font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> And with distance

              One gives over to a language and then<br>
              What was given, given over? (<i>Under Flag</i> 30)</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These questions 
          are central to Kim's exploration of the relations between diaspora and 
          national, cultural identities. Rather than offering any direct answers 
          to the questions, Kim moves beyond Korean immigrants' experience to 
          suggest an alternative view of who &quot;we&quot; are as historical 
          subjects in Part Three of this poem.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Evoking the indiscriminate 
          nature of the rain, Kim articulates an inclusive vision of &quot;our&quot;

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This &quot;assembly&quot; 
          of us-all of us from all corners of the world-undermines the insistence 
          on a monolingual, uniform ethnic or national identity, and subverts 
          the hierarchical binary constructs of &quot;us&quot; over here and &quot;them&quot; 
          over there, as alluded to in the first two parts of the poem. In this 
          assembly there is no hierarchy of race, culture, or nationality, no 
          preordained binary social order, no established center to which the 
          new, the different must conform. Indeed, this assembly consists of what 
          Deleuze might call &quot;differences within multiplicities,&quot; which 
          &quot;replace schematic and crude oppositions&quot; (<i>Difference</i> 
          182). It is an assembly constituted by &quot;an internal multiplicity&quot; 
          which is &quot;non-localisable,&quot; thus having an &quot;indetermination 
          [that] renders possible the manifestation of difference freed from all 
          subordination&quot; (<i>Difference </i>183). As the title &quot;Into 
          Such Assembly&quot; suggests, Kim's poems of diaspora call into question 
          naturalized singular, homogeneous, or hierarchical national and cultural 
          identities, which are often maintained by binary categorizations of 
          peoples and cultures. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Asserting an unassimilable 
          otherness that suggests &quot;an internal multiplicity,&quot; Kim's 
          poetry disrupts binary relations between majority and minority cultures. 
          In doing so, her poetry carries out the task David Palumbo-Liu proposes 
          for minority discourse: &quot;It is a specific task for minority discourse 
          to ascertain the interpenetration of minor and dominant cultures, and 
          to see that reconfiguration as a site of a politicized aesthetics&quot; 
          (202). Keenly aware of the agency of her poetics as a site of politicized 
          aesthetics, Kim regards her writing of poems as a way of interrogating 
          &quot;questions of national narratives, transcultural narratives, narratives 
          of cultural and political diaspora, and concepts or perhaps more accurately, 
          hybridizations of human community&quot; (Morrison 84). Speaking as the 
          other in the U.S. nation-space, bringing into English and American poetry 
          an irreducible difference, Myung Mi Kim, like other minority American 
          poets, is transforming the once Eurocentric American poetry, while inscribing 
          histories of other times and places across national borders. The hybrid 
          music of Kim's poetry is the sound of history. As those lines from the 
          opening poem of <i>Under Flag</i> state: &quot;What sound do we make, 
          &quot;n&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;g&quot; / Speak and it is sound 
          in time&quot; (13). The &quot;sound in time&quot; in Kim's poetry is 
          duration of memory, of history, and of the process of becoming, materialized 
          in contaminated English. </font></p>
