            <p><font size="2"><b>The following discussion took place in San Francisco 
              in December of 1997.</b></font></p>
            <p>Yedda Morrison: You mentioned in a recent lecture that &quot;real 
              change&quot; cannot happen in opposition. I'm very curious as to 
              what you mean by this. The popular notion of social/political/personal 
              transformation seems to be that the friction and tension that opposition 
              creates is fundamentally generative and change cannot occur without 
              it. Do you have a model for social change which is not based in 
              opposition?</p>
            <p>Myung Mi Kim: To radicalize anything starts at a point of rupture; 
              naturally, change can't just happen along a continuum that has already 
              established itself, or it wouldn't be change. Likewise, you wouldn't 
              have the kind of alertness about it being change, because it would 
              be somehow naturalized or even perhaps neutralized in its potency-as 
              if it's just part of something that has already occurred. Something 
              I'm trying to work out in my own writing is this idea that change 
              is neither strictly &quot;oppositional&quot; nor does it occur as 
              a natural, linear progression. Even in the way we talk about how 
              radicalization or change happens, we begin by bifurcating: does 
              change happen this way or that way-even the in our desire to participate 
              in that radicalizing process we can't begin to actually figure out 
              the complexity of it; immediately we come to this either-or proposition. 
              I'm interested in augmenting or complicating that model of change 
              by opposition, by friction, by overthrowing the law of the father, 
              in order to embrace a model of radicalization that doesn't solely 
              rely on that kind of direct opposition. <br>
              <br>
              Like any good conversation, you have to acknowledge where in that 
              continuum the person you're talking to is located. Often I don't 
              think it's a matter of disagreeing with someone's poetics, or someone's 
              thinking about poetics/politics, but rather that we all come to 
              this conversation about radicalization at different paces, and if 
              we as writers, workers, readers, could agree to work really, really 
              hard on recognizing where each person is in that trajectory, in 
              that motion towards change or radicalization, then there is a kind 
              of inclusiveness that is necessary for real change.<br>
              In a concrete way, partly what we're talking about is a historical 
              rupture. Someone wants to insert and say that because there's been 
              this elaborate system in history of oppression and erasure, the 
              only way you can address that is to make sure that erasure doesn't 
              happen, and this necessitates being very, very vocal, very, very 
              loud, and very, very steadfast, which becomes this oppositional 
              mode; for example, all those anthologies of, you know, &quot;Forgotten 
              Voices,&quot; or &quot;Immigrant Women Voices,&quot; or whatever 
              it is, and you can actually make an investment of a whole lifetime 
              in that kind of oppositional, very loud, very focused, almost very 
              separatist kind of activity, and it can be very, very meaningful. 
              For me, the problem presents itself when someone, who for whatever 
              personal or political reasons is invested in that mode and that 
              mode only, can't honor something that doesn't resemble that oppositional 
              model. It becomes very limiting when anything outside of this mode 
              gets relegated to-&quot;you're not part of the potential to radicalize.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              I would like to propose that if we could simply acknowledge that 
              any move towards radicalization doesn't always look like just one 
              thing, that then we can begin to talk to each other. And then one 
              doesn't have to make a decision about which way is the way. But 
              there's this possibility for modulation and conversation around 
              what oppositional looks like anyway. Because for me, I need to deliberate 
              about how I am oppositional so that it doesn't re-enact and replicate 
              those very things that we are saying we want to &quot;oppose&quot; 
              or shed light on. To be vigilant, even hypervigilant to that tendency 
              to replicate power structures, we need to recognize that we're all 
              part of a machinery that moves towards some sort of balance. This 
              balance demands that you strive for change in the way that this 
              work has always been conducted, rather than some meaning of opposition 
              that is an invention of how opposition happens. <br>
              <br>
              To thematize opposition for me is a direct replication of the whole 
              machinery of the narrative of empire making, the narrative of sense 
              making, the narrative of power-making. I think of the last decade 
              as a time of trying to develop some way of acknowledging that there's 
              an arc along which people are at different points of understanding 
              their own meaning of opposition. If we can respect this in each 
              other, especially around issues of ethnicity and those things which 
              are more thematically recognizable, they don't simply become part 
              of a whole language of opposition.</p>
            <p>Y: What you're saying makes me think about Raymond Williams' notion 
              of oppositional vs. alternative stances. The whole idea of cultural 
              inclusion and exclusion-what becomes appropriated by dominant culture, 
              what becomes in a sense, co-opted by the system and therefore deflated 
              in terms of efficacy.</p>
            <p>M: Yes; so in a sense change can't act out its potential to be 
              radicalizing or oppositional. In a way it's almost immediately used 
              up as fodder for the machinery that maintains those limits and perimeters 
              of what's inside and outside, what's different and what's not. So 
              in a way, it hasn't played out its full course before it gets preempted 
              and folded into something else. I think this has such huge implications 
              for poetics, which is probably why you brought it up along with 
              the whole question of what's recognizable and unrecognizable. Can 
              you really effect change if the culture in which you're operating 
              can't even begin to recognize the fact that your unrecognizability 
              is making a contribution? <br>
              <br>
              Can you follow through with some measure of conviction that by providing 
              an example, however small, of your particular rendering, one makes 
              a difference. I've come to a point where I have to believe that's 
              true. I have to believe that any time authenticating work is taken 
              on, even by one person-one poet at a time-it does become completely 
              saturated with some kind of possibility. We are all indoctrinated 
              into making choices about our work where we don't allow this to 
              happen. There could be legions of us saying, I don't want to be 
              unrecognizable, I don't want to be relegated immediately to this 
              region of unrecognizability which seems to equal no potential for 
              &quot;social efficacy,&quot; to use Lyn Hejinian's phrase. Who wants 
              that mantle of nontranslatability between their work and the world? 
              I'd put a lot of pressure on looking at that equals sign- </p>
            <p>Y: That brings up a lot of questions about audience, the insular 
              nature of the poetry community, &quot;preaching to the converted,&quot; 
              etc., which are valid concerns. We don't want to fall into some 
              sort of social realist model of writing in order to ensure translatability, 
              we want to be true to our creative impulses, yet we want to be as 
              broad reaching as we can, don't we? Nor can we make assumptions 
              about audience because that's probably the most limiting thing one 
              could do, make assumptions about someone else's ability to understand. 
              Maybe it's enough that &quot;authenticating&quot; work exists, but 
              translatability aside, who reads it? I think this ties in with the 
              line of yours from Under Flag, &quot;the widest angle of vision 
              before vision fails to mean.&quot; How broad can something be, how 
              much can a form hold before the form is compromised, how inclusive 
              can a poem, a movement, a poetics be before its &quot;aim&quot; 
              is completely diffused? </p>
            <p>M: I think there is always some kind of invisible, constant, millisecond-by-millisecond 
              negotiation between the form and its divestment, between the poem 
              and the world, that you're engaging every time you decide to write 
              anything. However, any poem having any kind of cultural translation 
              in the Twenty-first century-frankly, it just isn't going to happen. 
              I was in a bookstore doing Christmas shopping for my son, Malcolm, 
              and I was noticing the way in which books are cast. That someone 
              would buy Best American Short Stories 1997 and Best American Essays 
              1997, but not Best American Poetry 1997-when they're all sitting 
              there right next to each other-you begin to understand on some real 
              visceral levels this whole question of where/how poetry meets the 
              world. <br>
              <br>
              It's so problematic for writers in our historical moment. Again, 
              I think that I would answer that concern by saying that there's 
              some awareness on my part, different from even five years ago, that 
              we need to do two actions simultaneously. The first task is undertaking 
              the kind of devotion and conviction towards authenticating the work 
              you must do, the work we each must undertake, and that forms the 
              basis for a much larger vision for a mobilizing potential for poetry. 
              If in this way we each meet our own liberatory potential in the 
              way that we pursue our work, that has to make a difference. Because 
              finally, it will no longer be a case of writer X or Y or Z in isolation, 
              but that if enough of us take on the task of personal liberation, 
              the task itself becomes meaning-making or meaningful. As a community 
              of writers and readers and poets and thinkers, we're afraid we're 
              in some kind of isolation, but maybe we can use this timidity and 
              tenuousness and make it into something. Not that everything will 
              be the same then, but that we have as a basic link the idea that 
              we honor each other in the service of meeting our own liberatory 
              potential. That's one arena. The second thing is to work out as 
              many different models of where poetry can exist, where poetry can 
              be inserted, can be read, experienced, performed; what are the various 
              different ways that we can make poetry have contexts. We talk about 
              community as if we knew what that meant, but really, we have such 
              a limited idea. What if there were worker brigades and we all decided 
              on five different ways that we could bring poetry to some place, 
              or to go into a situation and see what poetry is already there. 
              Poetry is simply how you participate in language, and we all do 
              that. We go the grocery store and say hello to the clerk, and we've 
              done something with language. I think that we can actually make 
              a kind of intervention by proposing that poetry be experienced in 
              the world, in the masses, culturally, even given the culture that 
              we do have-it's something about really sharpening and honing what 
              we mean by how we do our work, and of course that's going to feel 
              like it's happening in isolation. But by finding some ways to keep 
              translating your work, tapping into what you already know how to 
              do and using it-because we each have places where we function best-so 
              that if every writer could identify that place, maybe this would 
              get other people to read, write, and think more about poetry. This 
              sounds like an agenda (laughs), but I've been thinking about it 
              a lot lately...</p>
            <p>Y: So if we could just wave a magic wand and realize all this... 
              poets pursuing their own liberatory potential through authenticating 
              work and in turn, creating more venues around the city for reading 
              and sharing their work-what would be your hope? What do you see 
              this generating in terms of social change?</p>
            <p>M: I think it would take a lot of the pressure off the demand that 
              poetry be this efficacious thing. Because the social terms are so 
              brittle, we poets put a lot of pressure on poetry to do something 
              or be something, or enact something. I think the more that poetry 
              can become part of a larger structure that supports it, the more 
              it will take some of the edginess off of all these decisions we 
              think we have to make-like, what is poetry for, or who's going to 
              read it anyway. We'll just have evidence that it exists and it's 
              real, and applicable to life, not not applicable, which I think 
              is how we often experience it today. <br>
              <br>
              Mostly I want to fight the overwhelming sense of isolation that 
              accompanies the making of poems, and find ways to create community 
              that aren't just &quot;oh, we're such a happy-happy, joy-joy collective 
              aren't we,&quot; but something that's real, not just a band-aid. 
            </p>
            <p>Y: One certainly sees this kind of pressure you're speaking of 
              inherent within, and exacerbated by, the publishing world. There's 
              so little going on in some ways, so few opportunities, that it creates 
              this intense pressure, and consequently engenders this very closed 
              way of dealing with each other and with the way that poetry intersects 
              with community. You've talked about this, a group of women poets 
              for instance, submitting a collaborative project to a book contest, 
              that kind of practical subversion of the agreed upon procedure, 
              which in terms of the publishing world is largely unheard of I would 
              guess... </p>
            <p>M: Well, that's partially what's behind my allegory of going into 
              the bookstore. Making poems so easily gets jettisoned into authorship, 
              or the commercial potential of authorship-and I don't mean commercial 
              as financial necessarily-but even in the way that we each think 
              of legitimation-and that there's only such a poorly and singularly 
              defined idea of the meaning of publishing-that somehow publishing 
              equals legitimation equals a certain kind of authorship or privileging 
              of the single author. There's some weird way in which privilege 
              enters, and in some cases it should enter. I'm not suggesting that 
              we all create only collective books-there's the oppositional thing 
              again! My proposition, then, isn't to counteract or demolish this 
              notion of privilege, but to have multiple notions of privilege so 
              that publishing isn't the only way you have a sense of work being 
              greeted by the world. What other kind of constructs could support 
              the idea of honoring someone's work? How else can we say, &quot;your 
              work is important, we want to read your work, we want to be in conversation 
              with your work&quot; ? How many multiple locations can we make that 
              support our creativity and hunger for meaning?</p>
            <p>Y: This seems to necessitate a certain kind of generosity, because 
              it's an acceptance based on &quot;I appreciate your work,&quot; 
              not an acceptance based on the model of competition and external 
              legitimation, i.e., commercial potential as you say. If we're all 
              scrambling for a few spots, how can generosity exist?</p>
            <p>M: That's right. Generosity doesn't exist, period. For me, where 
              I can say politicize, I have to say that word generosity. Part of 
              being political for me in this climate that we live in is trying 
              to remember to have a human face. That's also where oppositional 
              politics smack of a certain kind of patriarchy, because it's very 
              unsubtle-as long as you oppose and you make it really clear that 
              you're oppositional, then you can proceed. Of course you can be 
              loud and convincing and forceful and forthright, you can persuade 
              me, I wouldn't necessarily disagree with this sort of stance towards 
              change, but it still has to be done with the human face, with attention 
              to the implications of one's actions. We must track the meanings 
              and residences of our actions.<br>
              <br>
              So to be political or politicized, with that human face on, with 
              the ability to read subtleties and nuances as to how you affect 
              the systems around you, whether they are intimate relationships 
              or professional environments, or whatever, how can we attend to 
              that whole circuitry,, not just one corner of it, the corner you 
              want to hit right now. My sense is that the work is so perplexing 
              that it is never that kind of direct missile hit or direct translation. 
              There's always the mistranslation, or the thing that didn't connect, 
              or the people you forgot to say thank you to. How can we keep making 
              wider the terms by which we politicize or radicalize? I think generosity 
              is a possible mode by which we can tend to the business of listening 
              and, ultimately, of change.</p>
            <p>Y: I was thinking as you were speaking, that in this time of sensory 
              overload and rampant consumerism, we're really trained out of listening 
              or looking attentively and that this is part of the practice of 
              poetry- to reinvigorate in ourselves the ability to listen beyond 
              assumption, to retrain ourselves to listen to multiplicities and 
              nuances-which seems political in and of itself.</p>
            <p>M: Yes, absolutely. That's why when we were talking about whether 
              it does in fact make a difference if each writer enacts their own 
              liberatory process, I said yes, I think it does. If I can begin 
              to occupy that space of tending and attending, of attention and 
              of tracking subtleties, and to project out of that space with a 
              kind of perseverance that's not just like determination but a perseverance 
              that's in the service of tracking complexity, then I'm getting somewhere. 
              I mean, if I manage this vis a vis my work, if this becomes a poetics, 
              it has to alter the way that I take in the world and the others 
              around me. In this sense, there's no separation between the kind 
              of poetics one might try to occupy and the way that process develops 
              you.<br>
              Of course, this can all feel a little too slow. I mean how long 
              can I sit and be attentive when the world is blowing up? These are 
              all questions we answer as they come up, you can't have an a priori 
              answer because then it wouldn't be an answer, but a summary. Those 
              uncertain and undecidable spaces of- am I making a difference?- 
              will this contribute?- how can I know? Those undecidable locations 
              are actually part of the work. It doesn't feel great, it's not that 
              kind of exhilarated state, or at least not for very extended periods 
              of time, but it is a lived state, and it's a true one.<br>
              <br>
              But certainly these things are hard to reconcile because you feel 
              with this kind of bearing in on your poetics that it has to, is 
              bound to, translate into some kind of politics or activist stance 
              in the world. You can know that, but it can still subjectively feel 
              like you're doing nothing and that kind of disjunction or mismatch 
              is hard, really hard. Sometimes I say, today, with this line, with 
              this image, all I can feel is the mismatch? and I have to allow 
              that to be true- which can be really depressing. <br>
              But again, I'm reminded that there's something really strange about 
              oppositional anything-oppositional poetics, oppositional politics-it's 
              like saying we're all just going to go for that high, we know we're 
              making a difference, we see the evidence-here we go. To me that 
              would be a really suspicious place to live for very long. I mean, 
              I want that, who wouldn't, but over time, over the course of a lived 
              life, or a long poem, that would be a really hard place to maintain-what 
              are you cutting off in order to sustain that high? I can see in 
              the ways in which we've been talking about it today as well as in 
              my Long Poem seminar at San Francisco State, that it can feel and 
              look like inaction. You have to take that anxiety and restlessness 
              into account, into the formulation and sometimes you'll be able 
              to convert that into action and actually do something tangible-but 
              mostly, it will just be &quot;a part of.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              I was thinking too that sometimes it's easier to accommodate that 
              restlessness inside a poem than it is to live it- there's some really 
              different expectations about results. In a poem you can teach yourself 
              to have a much more fluid idea of action and energy and how they 
              have to be part of each other for something to actually happen, 
              for real change to happen. But in &quot;real life,&quot; whatever 
              that is, I'm much more impatient. I don't think its a matter of 
              reconciling it, but of being aware.</p>
            <p>Y: So you think then that the practice of poetry over the course 
              of a lifetime will train one to apply what is worked out in a poem 
              to the lived life? That there's that kind of transference? </p>
            <p>M: I certainly hope so! And that's one way to answer that sense 
              of inaction which is to say that there's evidence in the work to 
              support the notion that there is action-and that the writing process, 
              however slowly, does convert to real action in real time. </p>
            <p>Y: I'm interested in the relationship to narrative in your work. 
              It's been such a debated issue for some time now in terms of History 
              as metanarrative, &quot;postmodern&quot; deconstruction as practiced 
              by the language poets, etc. You said once that Mei Mei Brussenbrugge 
              attended one of your readings and said, &quot;Oh, you do tell stories.&quot; 
              You certainly include histories, erased histories, in your work; 
              how does narrative factor into this?</p>
            <p>M: I think my take on this has been the same for a very long time; 
              none of us would be brought to language, none of us would desire 
              to write, unless there was a deep urgency to say , and this deep 
              urgency to say, is to tell, and to tell, is to narrate. Now, whether 
              that looks like a narrative or not is something else entirely, but 
              for me it's always the question of how can you get the closest proximity 
              to how you must tell something. I think what I see being exercised 
              now is that we have more and more variegated ways of telling something 
              so this question of whether something is narrative or not is almost 
              defunct. I think you almost have to say, there is a narrative, there 
              is an urgency to speak, but the means by which we narrate are very, 
              very different and must be different. Part of the meaning of being 
              a historical subject now is that you really have to engage in how 
              you're going to tell something. Maybe the tendency or the trend 
              around narrative for me is constituted around how can you recognize 
              what the narrative conventions and strategies are that you have 
              a relationship to. What do you simply utter, and then what are the 
              conventional notations of narrative that you actually can't digest, 
              ingest, include. With this you have to refigure and reinvent and 
              reoccupy the manner of telling. What's happening around narrative 
              for me isn't simply the story, but the means by which the story 
              is told. </p>
            <p>Y: Under Flag is such a &quot;story,&quot; an epic narrative, a 
              telling. Perhaps that comes through for me because I've been trained 
              to read in this way; but what about someone without the privilege 
              of such an education-how does a text begin to translate if one doesn't 
              have the skills to read in this way?</p>
            <p>M: It's so disturbing for me that when the surface of the poem 
              behaves in a way that signals no single, clear, traceable narrative 
              strategy, the text suddenly becomes alarming. It immediately becomes 
              an issue of &quot;what are we being told?&quot; or &quot;I don't 
              understand.&quot; Meanwhile, if the reader would simply remove that 
              initial response and ask what is there to be understood, then there 
              would be no impediment to receiving the story, because the story 
              is larger than the issue of not understanding the strategies by 
              which the story is being told. The story is there, it has a kind 
              of enduring quality, a permanence and scale, a specific weight of 
              history and experience which will be communicated. We need to get 
              beyond the anxiety around not being told in the way were accustomed 
              to and discover new ways of listening. </p>
            <p>Y: Do you think this is in part due to the relationship we're trained 
              to have with printed material? We've been taught to read as an almost 
              passive activity, for a very narrow kind of meaning, while also 
              desiring a cohesive story, which is then further compounded by the 
              authority that anything in print tends to claim. Perhaps the reader 
              doesn't necessarily want to participate in the ways your work, for 
              instance, demands. This type of reading takes a kind of openness, 
              for lack of a better word, and it involves work-the reader must 
              participate in the creation of meaning, which isn't usually what 
              we want or expect when we settle down to read a book.</p>
            <p>M: Yes, I think because a lot of times one reads for that kind 
              of epiphany, that kind of &quot;aha&quot; of recognition. None of 
              these ideas or demands for the poem are suspicious in and of themselves-I 
              mean, of course we want to see ourselves translated, we want someone 
              to literally articulate our experience for us-to have the relief 
              of seeing ourselves-that is the gift between reader and writer. 
              Now, my worry is that due to the kind of histories and literary 
              histories and commercial histories we've inherited, the place where 
              that epiphany can happen, where connection and recognition can happen, 
              has become so reduced. Unless your text follows a certain contour, 
              we're resourceless to experience it, we say it has no meaning which 
              is a very strange idea. <br>
              <br>
              When we were talking about broadening and generosity before, here 
              would be a good instance of translating what exactly I mean by that-how 
              would it be possible to read meaning if you put a human face on 
              every text regardless of what school, what poetics, what kind of 
              aesthetic ideals it had. If you really listen for the encounter, 
              how could you not know what made that book, how could you say it's 
              inexplicable or devoid of meaning? You could say, &quot;it's not 
              made of meanings that I would make,&quot; or &quot;it's not constituted 
              of meanings I already understand,&quot; but beyond that you have 
              to understand it because writing is simply that act of encounter 
              and communication. <br>
              <br>
              We can't keep playing out our personal investment in how meaning 
              must be made-I mean, most of the time it's completely unexamined. 
              It's not like someone even knows that they're participating in that 
              way, it's just that they haven't necessarily unpacked the way that 
              they're operating when they come to the site of reading. A lot of 
              times it is sort of an unwitting, unexamined, stance.</p>
            <p>Y: Also, if we're reading to find something of ourselves in the 
              text, I might pick up one of your books and say, &quot;oh, this 
              is the experience of a Korean-American woman, there's little here 
              for me-yeah, we're both women, but...&quot; But when texts are process 
              or experience-based like yours seem to be, there is a distilling 
              down of the personal to reveal what's potentially universal in even 
              the most specific of events. Do you think that that is true?</p>
            <p>M- Absolutely, and that fits beautifully with this idea of the 
              human face. If &quot;I recognize you&quot; can be one of the meanings 
              of literature, then we've done a great deal of work. So yes, the 
              particulars may differ, you may not be a one-point-five Korean American 
              immigrant woman, but if there's something in the way I've been able 
              to render my experience, that releases in the reader a way of speaking 
              to her experience, then it doesn't matter that I'm Korean American 
              and she's Chicano or whatever. It's the manner in which you're led 
              into the experience, that either releases you or doesn't. But it 
              has that possibility of connecting you to yourself, and hopefully 
              to the writer's experience too, in some way. Ultimately it's the 
              return to your own condition by something that you see another text 
              take up that is so profound. <br>
              This was brought up in my Work of Silence Class-which is alot of 
              what we were talking about-in fact the word &quot;encounter&quot; 
              came into usage from the Celan essay &quot;The Meridian.&quot; So 
              what we're talking about is that moment of encounter between how 
              the text makes itself and how the reader receives those actions. 
              There's some sort of translatability that becomes part of the narrative 
              if you will-the meaning of being able to read anything seems really 
              important right now in our present moment where we've become inattentive 
              to almost everything. To look at examples of texts that have come 
              out of the near impossibility of speaking, texts that in a sense 
              allow for the impossibility of speaking. To me this seems so unbearable 
              and exquisite-</p>
            <p>Y: Like Mallarme's &quot;A Tomb For Anatole,&quot; which is really 
              notations for a text he was never able to write.</p>
            <p>M: And Paul Celan, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. With these writers we 
              are in the company of language that has been met with potential 
              erasure; what happens in that kind of collaboration between the 
              impossibility of utterance and finding the means by which to utter? 
              That space is never a decided, resolved, fixed point, and part of 
              the exquisiteness is that it is constantly in motion, constantly 
              reshaping itself. I suppose any poem is that, and really is always 
              on the cusp of coming into legibility-formally, psychically, politically. 
              For me those works that keep re-invigorating that space of silence 
              and erasure, the space of the seemingly untranslatable, are the 
              ones in which you really feel some sort of endurance and power.</p>
            <p>Y: That's interesting in terms of what you were saying earlier 
              about translatability and effectiveness vis-a-vis the practical 
              application of poetry and the incongruency of that. These writers, 
              Celan, Cha, et al, have posited their &quot;untranslatability&quot; 
              onto the page, and however many years later people in your classes 
              are reading these texts and recognizing something in their own historical 
              moment. Perhaps you might talk a bit about teaching, and if that 
              feels like a way for you to ease some of the anxiety we were talking 
              about earlier in terms of poetry's political efficacy.</p>
            <p>M: I probably have to answer that question from lots of different 
              directions. On the one hand, by teaching, I have intimate and intensive 
              conversations with practicing writers which absolutely renew me. 
              Conversations around how to keep further and further pushing into 
              your art as a means of being a citizen, with awareness, with political 
              conviction and insight, absolutely make me feel like I'm in a place 
              where I keep seeing potential played out. Also, the more I teach 
              the more I'm finding language to articulate my concerns.<br>
              <br>
              But you're also immediately aware that you're part of an institution 
              that perpetuates certain kinds of models and not others. Part of 
              how I have to make sense of it is by saying-in producing and maintaining 
              certain kinds of conversation in my courses, I am making an intervention. 
              My teaching strives to address the very institutional character 
              under which <br>
              <br>
              I have to play these things out. So that's completely problematic 
              and a sure formula for exhaustion, not only for people who teach, 
              but for anybody associated with any kind of institution. Academia 
              is a machine built around a certain kind of depletion; everyone 
              gets tired very quickly. It is hard to take on the work of maintaining 
              this intensive dialogue of poetics and translating poetics to the 
              world, from inside the institution, but all the more reason why 
              I feel I do and will take it on. This struggle, this contradiction, 
              becomes part of the radicalizing potential which I've been talking 
              about. The way that you maintain and foster conversation, even given 
              the institutional character under which we're all captive, becomes 
              part-perhaps tiny, perhaps not at all, but hopefully-of the radicalizing 
              potential for how we think about art, poetry, poetics, and how we 
              think about those things being applied. <br>
              So teaching is on the one hand a way to maintain certain kinds of 
              contacts, but it's certainly not the fantasy of how to do that. 
              There is also a kind of institutional amnesia-you're in a great 
              class, and then in twelve weeks it's over and you have to worry 
              about registration and fight for spots in classes and it's this 
              horrible cheapening that happens. Everything is built on this model 
              of consumption-you use it up and then it's gone-rather than there 
              being something you build on. It's sad to teach in an institutional 
              context where all the work you do is basically set up to be eroded 
              by this &quot;forward motion.&quot; This is why its very very important 
              that if the person who teaches is a private conduit to the people 
              around her, at a certain point that group has to maintain its own 
              electricity without that person or that institution. I ask my students, 
              or I prompt them to ask themselves, how does one become part of 
              an enterprise which fights that sort of institutional amnesia, how 
              can you take on and perpetuate connections between people that you 
              had a genuine conversation going with. Finally, its very important 
              that we teach each other-writers who are at work can educate each 
              other and that's what I'd like to think teaching is about for me. 
              Perhaps for me the meaning of negotiating all of these issues is 
              just so like the meaning of writing a poem that I can actually do 
              it. It is so exquisitely in that cusp between possibility and impossibility, 
              of working with the knowledge that it's going to fall apart and 
              yet you must do it anyways.<br>
              <br>
              Y: So in teaching, writing and reading poetry you see the potential 
              for community making?</p>
            <p>M: Yes; you can no longer so easily participate in this kind of 
              perimeter making that is perpetuated by the Institution. For instance, 
              any act of reading releases you from a separate divisive place which 
              we all occupy the more and more privatized economical conditions 
              under which we live become. We have so few collective models left. 
              Reading is almost the closest thing I can think of that alerts you 
              to how to take into account a whole other ecosystem of someone else's 
              being-everything that they are. What is the meaning of being so 
              privatized? This a function of our economy certainly, but also more 
              than that. At this point, psychically, you can't be returned to 
              your own experience, let alone any one else's. </p>
            <p>Y: Looking at reading then as an act of community building, the 
              kind of attention that it takes to read someone else's work well 
              is the kind of attention it takes to understand someone else well 
              enough to embrace them.</p>
            <p>M: Right. Now apply that to what we were saying in the very beginning 
              about oppositional politics. This is precisely why I think for all 
              the loudness of oppositional politics, which might make one feel 
              as if something is being accomplished, ultimately, because it hasn't 
              tended to everything around the opposition, it's going to have a 
              short lived circuitry. In other words, there hasn't been a comprehensive 
              gesture towards what made the opposition necessary in the first 
              place. It's like reading a whole book and only choosing to pay attention 
              to one aspect or trajectory. <br>
              Again, in real life you may only be able to do that, maybe you have 
              to say that limitation can be empowering-you make a choice and you 
              act and that's empowering. I understand that. I even would accept 
              it probably; in certain situations you have to act, not deliberate. 
              I mean you don't always get a choice historically to go home and 
              read the book again. Action can and must be real but not if it's 
              the only thing we do...</p>
            <p>Y: As if action were necessary only because there's a specific 
              crisis-as if ambiguity didn't necessitate action also?</p>
            <p>M: Absolutely. The undecidability of whether I am making a difference 
              or not-that ambiguity is part of the answer. Part of the work of 
              answering the question of social efficacy has to include the ambiguity. 
              If you actually had an answer, you wouldn't be taking in the whole 
              full weight of the questions.</p>
            <p>Y: Particularly if we're using the models of production that we've 
              inherited to evidence something like social change. We have such 
              a limited vocabulary in terms of what it means to be productive 
              and to produce-what does productivity mean to us as &quot;products&quot; 
              of consumerism-where change isn't an object or 10,000 bright and 
              shiny objects on the shelf.</p>
            <p>M: Right. We have such a poverty-stricken idea of the meaning of 
              making, whether it's making poems or intimacies-there's this assumption 
              that it has to look like something recognizable. There's a focus 
              on the fixed, commodified exterior, rather than an internal, on-going 
              experience which keeps renewing itself regardless of the external 
              object. Once you start working on the notion of the poem emerging, 
              the poem that's being pushed through to the surface, not a poem 
              which you compose-once you make an allegiance to pay attention to 
              that kind of process, there is some tremendous release. It's not 
              immediate, but an ongoing process which you have to give to yourself.</p>
            <p>Y: Which again takes the kind of generosity you spoke of earlier...</p>
            <p>M: Yeah, and it's hard to have that kind of reading of it when 
              no one else in a sense confirms it for you. There's so little externally 
              that would confirm this type of &quot;progress.&quot;</p>
            <p>Y: And then compound that with being a woman or a woman of color 
              or a low income woman or whatever and you have to prove somehow 
              that you could be a productive white male if you just looked differently.</p>
            <p>M: Right, if you could just adopt those ways of being and working 
              you'd be validated.</p>
            <p>Y: If you're one step or six steps behind anyways the need to be 
              validated is further pressurized and compounded.</p>
            <p>M: It becomes harder and harder to map some sort of internal experience 
              of your relationship to making.</p>
            <p>Y: Given this, can you talk about your work in relation to various 
              established avant-garde traditions or other traditions you might 
              feel connected to or not?</p>
            <p>M: Clearly what has informed my work, and what I find myself responding 
              to, is the work that signals with its very way of composing itself 
              that it has no assumptions about what the poem is-that the poem 
              is what is in fact emerging at that very moment of encounter, with 
              your ear, with your psyche, with your body, with your historical 
              conditions. When you feel like you're in the company of someone 
              who is occupying undecidability, where things are in fact not known, 
              you come into a kind of knowing or negotiation through the writing 
              act itself. Those are the kinds of practices that have always made 
              me sit up and pay attention.<br>
              <br>
              A lot of work is being done by contemporary women writers that have 
              as their basic allegiance the question of putting into some sort 
              of motion everything that is one's subjective experience, everything 
              that is one's historical condition. There's this amazing interplay 
              between subjectivity, the world, your intellect, your cultural bearings, 
              all the things you do and don't know-and then the practical question-how 
              possible is it to maintain all those spheres as they come into the 
              field of writing with no prior decisions about what the poem will 
              be-letting that in fact completely alter and inform how the poem 
              gets made every time you sit down to write. <br>
              I associate a lot of Objectivist writing with these kinds of concerns. 
              George Oppen is very very important to my writing. A lot of the 
              propositional character of both the Objectivists, and later Projective 
              Verse, address what we've been talking about today.</p>
            <p>Y: In terms of your own writing practice, if you're trying to have 
              that kind of breadth of content inclusion without having some kind 
              of preconceived notion of what is going into the poem prosodically, 
              how does form function?</p>
            <p>M: Form for me is absolutely the thing that carries my poetic speculation. 
              Form is the body for speculation or form is where speculation about 
              all those fears meld and merge even if they are contestitory. So 
              form is not necessarily a shapely, elegant thing-it is the live 
              kicking wire in anything for me-it's about balance, music, and about 
              presencing contestitory forces. I'm always very curious when forms 
              break down. </p>
            <p>Y: So you don't have any preconceived notion of form when you go 
              into a poem?</p>
            <p>M: Actually it happens both ways for me. Often I see a visual sentence, 
              something scrolling. For example, it could be the relationship of 
              larger parts to smaller parts and I'll just have a diagram of something 
              that I can get from my head onto the paper. Sometimes I'll know 
              the architecture for something before I begin, but usually it breaks 
              down, so in a way it doesn't matter what happens first. I have a 
              visual sense of the form which I decide to act on or I start with 
              an open chunk of writing and then find some kind of architecture 
              emerging out of it. Either way, form is fascinating because you 
              don't know until you've really negotiated with all parts of it what 
              it is going to be. Even when you have a kind of foreknowledge it's 
              probably, at least for me, going to fall apart. The more you live 
              with a poem, there more it will ask different things. Form is probably 
              the most invigorating force in trying to promote a conversation 
              between different spheres of experience. </p>
            <p>Y: Are you working on anything right now?</p>
            <p>M: Yes, and speaking about architecture, this new book is going 
              to be in two large movements or motions. I know a lot about the 
              first half; the second half is just not there yet. When I started 
              what I think will be this book, I ran across this word &quot;metonic,&quot; 
              which means cycles of nineteen years. I started writing it at the 
              age of thirty-eight which is two cycles of nineteen. I already knew 
              the work involved this notion of days and thinking about the lived 
              life-something about a different way of organizing time in my life 
              and how if you approach your life in cycles of nineteen, you don't 
              get to do that many-five? maybe four? That acute awareness of having 
              lived a lot of my life, but also not. And something about bounds 
              and seeing different ways to organize the meaning of your life over 
              time and how to see it with some other skeleton. <br>
              <br>
              It's very hard to work with so little time allotted for my own writing. 
              Of course if I just sit around and can't finish the second half 
              I don't want to go into the third cycle of nineteen (laughs). There's 
              all kinds of breaking down of this notion of nineteen years throughout 
              the first half. The second half I think will completely dissolve 
              that and mutate into something else. It's so serendipitous, I was 
              literally looking up another word and my eye fell on &quot;metonic.&quot; 
              I felt like it was a sign (laughs). <br>
              Korean is coming into my writing more and more. It's an always evolving 
              relationship I have to it as a language and as a system of thought, 
              as linguistics, the grammar, the syntax, the sounds, everything 
              about it is always being recirculated. I never know exactly where 
              it's going to factor in or what kind of preoccupation it will provide. 
              But in DURA for example, one of the procedures I was using was taking 
              &quot;western&quot; texts and putting them up against Korean texts 
              that were written at the same time. If I were to take something 
              like Virgil and try to find something as ancient written in Korean, 
              I couldn't, because written Korean as old as Virgil would have been 
              in Chinese. <br>
              <br>
              With written Korean I'd have to start in 1440 something which is 
              really interesting to me because that's at the moment of the notion 
              of discovering the new world, taking it over, and what are we going 
              to do with it? I was trying to get these texts into some kind of 
              completion when sometimes there would be literally two languages 
              or I'd do a translation, a mock translation or a reverse translation; 
              who knows. That's one of the procedures among many but it still 
              interests me in terms of this current work as well-setting into 
              some kind of concurrent motion two texts that are linked by time 
              but separated, say by systems of language.</p>
            <p>Y: As are you...</p>
            <p>M: Yeah, right-I wonder where that came from! I feel like part 
              of DURA for me was my rereading of western civilization in a very 
              coded way. I'm very enamored with medieval grammar texts-how they 
              developed, how they became codified and how they engender each other. 
              The whole language of knowledge is fascinating I think. This notion 
              of what you're supposed to know. I feel wildly out of touch with 
              what I'm supposed to know; this also fuels my writing.<br>
