                      A specter is haunting poetic discourse-the specter of Rodrigo 
                      Toscano's poetry. <i>Platform</i>-the most recent book in 
                      Toscano's politico-poetic trajectory-is a multi-layered, 
                      polyvalent, multidimensional, multilingual <i>tour de force</i> 
                      that confronts Capital at every turn.<br>
                      <i>Platform</i>, as a whole, accomplishes many things at 
                      once: it explores the dialectical relations internal to 
                      poetry and politics in the era of corporate-driven globalization; 
                      it scours the socio-political terrain, abstracting deftly 
                      from the structures of capitalism to the on-the-ground, 
                      lived resistance to Capital's hegemony; and it illuminates/undermines 
                      the rhetorical constructs that quietly bolster the status 
                      quo. Toscano engages in dereification, as he torques the 
                      matrix of norm internalization-the breeding ground of the 
                      socially acceptable, the hybridized codes of the statistically 
                      significant, the master tropes of the U-Rah-Rah. Along the 
                      way, Toscano offers the reader a non-prescriptive cadastre 
                      of resistance through poems thronging with possibility.</p>
                    <p><i>Platform</i> is divided into five parts, parsimoniously 
                      labeled &quot;Group 1,&quot; &quot;Group 2,&quot; &quot;Group 
                      3,&quot; &quot;Group 4,&quot; and &quot;Group 5.&quot; Through 
                      all five Groups, the poems resolutely defy the oversimple 
                      neo-Descartian bifurcation of the world. As Toscano well 
                      knows (and shows), such bifurcation only leads to static 
                      reifications being imposed on the fluid interrelations of 
                      dynamic oppositions. In <i>Platform</i>, Toscano adopts 
                      a dialectical mode of poetic inquiry replete with a dynamic 
                      conception of theory and historical materialism that excavates 
                      the (re)production of the symbolic order. With the author-as-producer 
                      as theoretical bedrock, Toscano zeroes in on the site of 
                      discourse production.<b><font color="#75738C" size="2">4</font></b>

                      strips the magic from a work of art that is content to be 
                      a fetish, an idle pastime for those who would like to sleep 
                      through the deluge that threatens them, in an apoliticism 
                      that is in fact deeply political&quot;) and Foucault (&quot;We

                      we cannot exercise power except through the production of 
                      truth.&quot;), Toscano antes up poststructural poetics that 
                      are intensely concerned with the production (and reproduction) 
                      of meaning. In &quot;Eight Struggling Voices, Now Barely

                    <p>It is not the poetry/politics of people that determines 
                      their being, but on the contrary it is their social being 
                      that determines their poetry/politics. Within and between 
                      the poems in <i>Platform</i>, aesthetic and cultural practices 
                      interpenetrate certain discourses, and these discourses, 
                      in turn, join, interpenetrate, and/or disassemble aesthetic 
                      and cultural practices. Just as Capital is a process and 
                      not a thing, so is Toscano's poetry. Along the way, Toscano 
                      explodes the Cartesian separations between mind and matter, 
                      between consciousness and materiality, between theory and 
                      practice.</p>
                    <p>In <i>Platform</i>, Toscano presents a vigorous, non-formalistic 
                      system of &quot;Politically Arrayed Poetics&quot; that is 
                      designed to problematize simplistic scaling, to rigorously 
                      rupture, to question/disrupt linear political/poetic thought.

                    <p>Toscano's &quot;politically arrayed poetics&quot; cannot 
                      be reduced to mere issues of form and content. While he 
                      is certainly pressing against the discursive bracketing 
                      vis-&agrave;-vis the perceived boundaries of content, to 
                      say Toscano is mainly concerned with content issues is to 
                      give short shrift to the complexity of his intellectual 
                      project. In <i>Platform</i>, the idea of process and form 
                      are equally as important as notions of goal and content, 
                      if not more important. Upon delving into <i>Platform</i>, 
                      one's first impression may be chaos, and indeed there is 
                      an anarchic dimension to Toscano's practice (and this is 
                      part of the fun). </p>

                    <p><i>Platform</i> comes replete with a cultural specificity 
                      that firmly roots it in late Capital. Sometimes these socio-cultural 
                      allusions are direct (for example, Brazilian presidential 
                      hopeful, Lula [210-213]) and sometimes they are more oblique 
                      (Debray, Guevara et al. are alluded to only as &quot;<i>foco</i>-istas&quot;.[23]) 
                      Toscano's cultural allusions range the historical terrain, 
                      moving deftly from Roque Dalton (27) to the chief economist 
                      at First Union Corp. (65), from Alexandra Kollontai (27) 
                      to Francis Fukuyama (170), from Ellen Meiksins Wood (117) 
                      to George Soros (170), from mainline economists like Kenneth 
                      Galbraith and Milton Friedman (169) to Western Marxists 
                      like Georg Luk&aacute;cs (36, 127) and Louis Althusser (23). 
                      These allusions may be serious, may be playful, or may be 
                      both, but as a whole, they also constitute a critical, complex, 
                      nuanced excavation that speaks to the present. Whether he 
                      is pointing out a &quot;Transubstantiary Keynesian / retro-incrementalist 
                      / 'revolutionist'&quot; (47) or &quot;'An Ivy-League woodchuck's 
                      / latent order to / chompity chomp / stomp- / <i>out </i>/ 
                      openly / syndicalist poetics / <i>on cue</i>'&quot; (125) 
                      Toscano incisively slices through the rhetorical shroud, 
                      persistently seeking out forms of authority and domination 
                      and challenging their legitimacy.</p>
                    <p>And Toscano is not afraid to name names: he freely fingers 
                      the actors who hype and hock, who spray spittle on the virtual 
                      stump, who push the logic of late capitalism like a meta-advertisement 
                      for soap-powder. For instance, former U.S Trade Representative 
                      Charlene Barshevsky gets a shoutout/shoutdown (63) as does 
                      Exxon (94), the &quot;Nazi-like NYPD&quot; (202), and the 
                      WTO (218). Toscano's naming of names brings to mind Cornel 
                      West's articulation of &quot;selective morality,&quot;<b><font size="2" color="#75738C">6</font></b> 
                      and both would likely agree (though they go about their 
                      work in strikingly different ways) that the recognition 
                      of this &quot;selective morality&quot; is an important step 
                      on the road to deconstructing the normalized bourgeois myth 
                      that passes for the smooth surface of history.<b><font size="2" color="#75738C">7</font></b>

                    <p>This consistent, rich layer of cultural allusion is part 
                      of Toscano's broader concern for history. By history he 
                      does not mean the hardened codes of 'immutable' time-maps; 
                      nor does he mean the static schematic of the pseudo-pristine 
                      sunnyday. Rather he's talking about the radically contingent 
                      complex interlockings that together form what Bob Perelman 
                      has dubbed &quot;the empyrean of capital.&quot;<b><font size="2" color="#75738C">8</font></b> 
                      As Toscano, writes bitingly in &quot;Some Brooklyn Northside 
                      <i>Calaberitas</i> (Little Skulls) (Ironic Morsels),&quot; 
                      we might see &quot;History not as something / <i>you can 
                      live to tell your children</i>&quot; (188). History is a 
                      process; history's no mystery, or at least it shouldn't 
                      be. In &quot;Affekt Funeral / Affekt Jamboree&quot; Toscano 
                      sidles in satirically on this perpetually unfolding social 
                      process of history construction:</p>

                    <p>With Toscano, a poem can therefore be a mysterious thing. 
                      The poems in <i>Platform</i> move in many directions at 
                      once, and in ways that defy convenient categorization. When 
                      attempting to get some traction on Toscano's &quot;politically 
                      arrayed poetics&quot; it is useful to consider the work 
                      of Bertolt Brecht. Toscano indicates his debt to Brecht 
                      both epigraphically (20) and through allusion (165, 167), 
                      but the connections plunge deep beneath the surface of the 
                      page. To start with, both writers show an obvious concern 
                      for praxis, the perpetually unfolding process of reflection 
                      and action. Fredric Jameson's description of Brecht's praxis 
                      applies in compelling ways to Toscano's <i>Platform</i>:

                      The process of aesthetic autonomization, breaking the action

                      to dereify, but also to arouse praxis, to galvanize a dynamic 
                      embrace of the socio-political flux. Collaborative work, 
                      or collective praxis, is crucial. After all, as Kevin Davies 
                      - detourning Marx's <i>Theses on Feuerbach</i> - has so

                      satire, though satire is only one element within each of 
                      their methodological repertoires. Toscano includes four 
                      satires in <i>Platform</i>, and he uses, as does Brecht, 
                      a sharp satirical edge to illuminate and explore societal 
                      contradictions. Through estrangement and defamiliarization, 
                      Toscano seeks to identify the contradictory tendencies within 
                      social processes-tendencies that simultaneously support 
                      and undercut-since, as Michael Schmidt has pointed out, 
                      &quot;contradiction fosters change; the inherent contradictory 
                      essence of things provides an ever potential source for 
                      transformation.&quot;<b><font size="2" color="#75738C">11</font></b> 
                      Toscano's (and Brecht's) relational perspective emphasizes

                    <p>This deeper and more consistent introspection of practice 
                      is one thing that distinguishes <i>Platform</i> from his 
                      previous two books-<i>Partisans</i> (O Books, 1999) and 
                      <i>The Disparities</i> (Green Integer, 2002). Whenever there 
                      is mention of politics, the world of poetry is never far 
                      away. After &quot;BABYLON, N-Y-C&quot; comes &quot;a series 
                      of / supply lines / planned demand / a series of / reading 
                      series&quot; (68); after &quot;FTAA // Constabulatory / 
                      Reverberative / Structuralist / Limits?&quot; comes &quot;Strategy: 
                      // Secure Loan from the Multidiversity Reach Out Bank of 
                      America- / to pay of <i>interest </i>on / Amalgamated Langpo 
                      Support <i>Plank</i>-Bank&quot; (131-132).<br>
                      <br>
                      Another notable distinction with <i>Platform</i> is the 
                      amplified process of abstraction that he engages in. Throughout 
                      <i>Platform</i> Toscano deftly abstracts his level of generality, 
                      shifting his plane of comprehension from capitalist production 
                      as a whole to vinegar-soaked-bandana battles on the ground.<b><font size="2" color="#75738C">13</font></b> 
                      In particular, the poems in &quot;Group 5&quot; mark a distinct 
                      downward abstraction to moments of lived resistance, as 
                      Toscano investigates the UPS strike of 1997, General Secretary 
                      Lula's bid for the Brazilian presidency, a march for Amadou 
                      Diallo, and other historical moments. In this Group of poems, 
                      Toscano shows a palpable zest for the concrete, zeroing 
                      in on material relations in postmodernity.</p>
                    <p>These investigations, of course, raise questions of structure 
                      and agency. Throughout <i>Platform</i> Toscano edges in 
                      on the irreducible heterogeneity of resistance, the acute 
                      interdependency of the present as he puts his finger on 
                      the staccato-fire pulse of the &quot;Labor De-Deprivation 
                      <i>rhythm</i>&quot; (148). Through spatial and temporal 
                      extension, intertextual play, the overlapping of contexts, 
                      and by coming in aslant (all the while avoiding the surreptitious 
                      slide into a full-blown pomo perspectivalism), Toscano concocts 
                      his own system of citationality, offering the reader a lexicon 
                      of flux and a syntax of resistance. </p>
                    <p>In the end, <i>Platform</i> asks more questions than it 
                      delivers final answers. As he puts it in &quot;Early Morning 
                      Prompts for Evening Takes (or, Roll 'em!),&quot; &quot;a 
                      realization of what's yet unrealized- / postscript or / 
                      preamble / to praxis?&quot; (19) or in &quot;In-Formational 
                      Forum Rousers,&quot; &quot;All atomized mushroomy multitudes 
                      / to the great de-centered / re-centered / convergence?&quot; 
                      (118). It is this precise undecidability that wedges open 
                      the world to an ecology of possibility. <i>Platform</i>, 
                      therefore, taken as a whole, supports Marx's observation 
                      that &quot;the architect raises his structure in imagination 
                      before he erects it in reality.&quot; <b><font size="2" color="#75738C">14</font></b> 
                      Toscano seems to say that one's concrete environment can 
                      be remolded but only through &quot;a series of standoffs 
                      // before a standoff&quot; (231).</p>
                    <p>As <i>Platform</i> questions, it also indicts and it celebrates, 
                      and at the end of the day, it offers us poems of striking 
                      cultural density and multivalence that reverberate in the 
                      skull of the reader long after the last word has been read.</p>

                      for history is, in fact, bourgeois ideology. &quot;Myth 
                      deprives the object of which it speaks of all History. In 
                      it, history evaporates. It is a kind of ideal servant: it 
                      prepares all things, brings them, lays them out, the master 
                      arrives, it silently disappears: all that is left for one 
                      to do is enjoy this beautiful object without wondering where 
                      it comes from&quot; (151). <br>
