                    <p>Marjorie Perloff insists in <i>Radical Artifice</i> that 
                      the performance of John Cage's &quot;Lecture on the Weather&quot; 
                      is &quot;not about weather, it is weather.&quot; In Rodrigo 
                      Toscano's <i>The Disparities</i>, something similar occurs: 
                      I cannot speak simply about the poet's <i>work</i> but about 
                      the poems themselves <i>working</i>-working it out, working 
                      you over, working for the man, working the crowd-to depict 
                      the incongruities that authority, authenticity, reality, 
                      and identity produce. In this book-length work song (and 
                      at times, love song), he offers his product in various stages 
                      of refinement, and (DING!) down goes the hammer, puts a 
                      few dents in it, walks always, eyes the overseer (DING!), 
                      throws down his hammer again in the form of a question mark 
                      or maybe an ellipsis (DINK!), gives it an elbow-polish, 
                      addresses the buyer, then walks away again. The sheer muscle 
                      Toscano demonstrates in these poems is so seductive, I hardly 
                      notice whether there's any &quot;use-value&quot; to what's 
                      left on the anvil-perhaps because what's left are poems 
                      flexing, with each reading, manifold possibilities.</p>

                      By foregrounding process, the poems become translations 
                      of transition, existing between &quot;Land/ a story&quot; 
                      and &quot;ax/ a memory&quot; (from &quot;non-confidential 
                      memos&quot;).<br>
                      <br>
                      The book's title suggests the failure to represent, through 
                      language, the exchange between an evolving existence and 
                      variously perceived realities (&quot;<i>La distancia entre 
                      mi y estas calles</i>&quot; [The distance between me and 
                      these streets]). The titles of the poems, however, hint 
                      at our failure to fail completely- our need to keep punching 
                      the clock and provide at least <i>some</i> product or documentation, 
                      as seen in &quot;Circular No. 6,&quot; &quot;Premise No. 
                      1&quot; (as well as &quot;No. 2&quot; and &quot;No. 3&quot;). 
                      Too, the titles &quot;Journal&quot; or &quot;non-confidential 
                      memos,&quot; suggest a desire to make public the construction 
                      of self and realities, our &quot;hyperpublic aloneness.&quot;

                      Certainly, Green Integer's custom of placing the author's 
                      photo on the cover is testament to that. And despite the 
                      feeling that his poems are built on a strong theoretical 
                      foundation, Toscano's black and white smirk urges me to 
                      not easily replace the idiosyncratic with the ideological. 
                      But any critical approach is also a failure: &quot;Biographical. 
                      To be spoken for. To know/ <i>This</i> much, <i>this</i> 
                      long: new uninhabitabilities&quot; (from &quot;Premise No. 
                      3&quot;).<br>
                      <br>
                      Unmistakingly informed by Language Poetry, there's still 
                      a certain &quot;old school&quot; feel about much of the 
                      book (in the sense of a hybridization of past forms of address), 
                      especially the second part, beginning with the poem &quot;Journal.&quot; 
                      The groupings of &quot;thing-objects&quot; in &quot;Corollary 
                      A&quot; and &quot;Corollary B&quot; are driven-like many 
                      of the poems- by the musical and emotional intensity found 
                      in the lyrical/mystical tradition. And like the nomadic 
                      ghazal, rendering a world in motion necessarily combines 
                      corporeality with memory; and inquiry is spiritual (though 
                      I can hear Toscano thundering at that designation!), material, 
                      as well as inconclusive. Toscano writes,&quot;Myself an 
                      Item to boot, subtractive author/ Unboarding, now goes,-This 
                      far; where from? which force,/ acts?/ Threatening questions, 
                      as doves swoop below the mailbox.&quot; And I am reminded 
                      of Rumi's &quot;A Voice Through the Door&quot;: &quot;Lift 
                      your foot;/ cross over; move into the emptiness/ of question 
                      and answer and question. <br>
                      <br>
                      This questioning is especially marked in Toscano's performance 
                      of the poems, as witnessed in a recent reading at University 
                      at Buffalo's Wednesdays at Four Series. The inflection of 
                      interrogatives, as in the title poem (&quot;Anything? Plans, 
                      newstands. Are things not done on pace? / Time. A gap. As 
                      'to close the gap,' between what?) or as in &quot;Four or 
                      Five Estimations&quot; (&quot;I feel misplaced, a non-self 
                      spoke-estimations?&quot;) insist on participation, argumentation, 
                      not the acquiescence rhetorical devices require. His performance 
                      of the work also demonstrates the difficult relationship 
                      between the individual and the collective necessary to &quot;wordworking.&quot; 
                      Toscano writes, &quot;You know, formations repel as well, 
                      and why not?&quot; later suggesting we &quot;become intimate 
                      with what's alien.&quot; <br>
                      <br>
                      After his reading, I asked Toscano if this use of the interrogative 
                      comes out of the tendency Spanish-speakers have of punctuating 
                      a statement with a rhetorical question: <i>&iquest;S&iacute; 
                      o no?</i> (Yes or No?) <i>&iquest;Verdad que s&iacute;?</i> 
                      (Isn't it true?) <i>&iquest;O no?</i> (Right?) <i>Entiendes?</i> 
                      (Get it?). He says, &quot;yes,&quot; but also he's goading 
                      the public (by way of &quot;the public&quot; having <i>already</i> 
                      been goaded into a system of mutual receptivity).</p>
