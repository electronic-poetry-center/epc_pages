                      Toscano's long-awaited <i>The Disparities</i> (Sun &amp; 
                      Moon) demonstrates that it's time to get reacquainted with 
                      the <i>social</i> referent: complex of relations (i.e., 
                      post eidetic imagism <b><font size="2">&lt;1&gt;</font></b>) 
                      registered in an instant of time <font size="2"><b>&lt;2&gt;</b></font>. 
                      Fredric Jameson <br>
                      summarizes in an article published this year that in contrast 
                      to previous decades the &quot;motivations behind ideology 
                      no longer seem to need an elaborate machinery of decoding 
                      and hermeneutic reinterpretation; and the guiding thread 
                      of all contemporary politics seems much easier to grasp: 
                      namely, that the rich want their taxes lowered&quot; (137). 
                      By definition, the social referent avoids poetical tropes 
                      of &quot;mere technical facility and hollow formalism&quot; 
                      (in Steve Evans's phrase). Yet, of course, such a referent 
                      is prone to other, equally familiar, traps -- of vulgar 
                      realism. How avoid?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> With 
                      words of a Protestant theologian, for whom time would have 
                      peculiar philosophical resonance, the obvious: &quot;Not 
                      everything is possible at every time, not everything is 
                      true at every time, nor is everything demanded at every 
                      moment&quot; (Paul Tillich <font size="2"><b>&lt;3&gt;</b></font>). 
                      From this comes timeliness, that quality of subjective time 
                      of knowing when is &quot;the right time&quot; (and for what), 
                      kairos, which the ancient Greek language differentiates 
                      from chronos (objective, formal -- clock -- time that is 
                      neither &quot;right&quot; nor &quot;wrong&quot;). Qualities 
                      of subjective time combine to produce &quot;social times&quot; 
                      for the sociological method of Immanuel Wallerstein; and 
                      he follows Fernand Braudel who famously distinguishes their 
                      three durations: longue duree (e.g., capitalist mode of 
                      production), conjunctural or cyclical (e.g., supply- demand 
                      crises), and current time (opinions of the day).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> For 
                      poetics, Steve Evans recently reconceptualized the kairos 
                      of social time as &quot;social tense&quot;: &quot;A grasp 
                      of the way in which artistic materials are socially tensed 
                      -- storing certain potentialities, lacking others, with 
                      still others momentarily exhausted as some awaken again 
                      from dormancy -- is what keeps the artist (if it can) from 
                      sinking into mere technical facility and hollow formalism&quot; 
                      (43). Toscano's poetry investigates the problematic of &quot;social 
                      tense&quot;: how does one address the longue duree with 
                      and on the terms of what one is given to hand in the moment? 
                      </font></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Once, 
                      various poets' structuralisms helped with this, homologizing 
                      capitalism and language. The &quot;social&quot; retains 
                      currency, if only because the mysterious commodity-form 
                      still conjures it as exchange-value: despite how virtually 
                      all space is now privatized, we must live in it. In the 
                      opening three poems of the book, Toscano retains aspects 
                      of what might loosely be called the west coast walking poem 
                      (for flaneur, Situationist, activist, townie) since, on 
                      one hand, &quot;The bureaucrats of wills (some young) have 
                      set their snares,&quot; and on the other, at least <br>
                      the prospect of an alternative economy still urges images 
                      of an ideal polis.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Is 
                      it possible that the message of the kairos is an error? 
                      <font size="2"><b>&lt;4&gt;</b></font> (&quot;McCaffery, 
                      Andrews, put down your mowers&quot;. . . . <b><font size="2">&lt;5&gt;</font></b>) 
                      Tillich, again, replies: &quot;The message is always an 
                      error; for it sees something immediately imminent which, 
                      considered in its ideal aspect, will never become a reality 
                      and which, considered in its real aspect, will be fulfilled 
                      only in long periods of time. And yet the message of the 
                      kairos is never an error; for where the kairos is proclaimed 
                      as a prophetic message, it is already present; it is impossible 
                      for it to be proclaimed in power without its having grasped 
                      those who proclaim it&quot; (Wallerstein 282). While Wallerstein 
                      securalizes and historicizes Tillich's philosophical paradox, 
                      Toscano assumes the paradox as a given. From &quot;Circular
