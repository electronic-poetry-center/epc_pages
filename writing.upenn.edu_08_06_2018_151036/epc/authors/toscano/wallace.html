                      Rodrigo Toscano is an important figure in a fascinating 
                      and growing area of contemporary poetry, one that explores 
                      problems of cultural history, identity and politics while 
                      also using the complex, disruptive language structures frequently 
                      associated with avant garde literature. In Toscano's work, 
                      the concept of culture turns out to be more complex than 
                      the increasingly powerful cliches of institutional multiculturalism 
                      would have us believe. The idea that drives much of that 
                      multiculturalism is that despite our differences we are 
                      all individuals who want to &quot;be ourselves,&quot; who 
                      want our cultural histories recognized and pure and our 
                      capitalist options open. In practice, this idea turns out 
                      to be a fundamentally bureaucratic tool, an example of the 
                      contemporary &quot;management of differences&quot; that, 
                      in their crucial recent book <i>Empire</i>, Antonio Negri 
                      and Michael Hardt argue is central to contemporary bureaucratic 
                      control. Despite the progress it undoubtedly represents 
                      over earlier forms of racism, such control still forces 
                      people into the sort of singular identities that are as 
                      easy to recognize as those official charts on which people 
                      check a box saying &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Caucasian.&quot; 
                      But in Toscano's work, the problems of culture cannot be 
                      resolved so simply, because they were never that singular 
                      in the first place.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>The bi-lingual narrator of Toscano's first full-length 
                      collection of poetry, <i>The</i> <i>Disparities</i>, recognizes 
                      that his cultural background is not simply Hispanic. Instead, 
                      it is made up of a complex encounter <i>between</i> cultures 
                      and histories in which no cultural identity remains pure. 
                      This encounter is crucially embedded in the official language 
                      of the United States--as Nuyorican poet Ed Morales pointed 
                      out in a talk at George Washington University several years 
                      ago, the number of non-English words in the English language 
                      grows all the time. In fact, a close look at Toscano's book 
                      shows that it's more than bi-lingual. He feels just as free 
                      to use French, German or even Middle English as he does 
                      Spanish or English. Or, perhaps equally accurately, he feels 
                      just as unable to avoid them.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Toscano's poetry frustrates the moment of recognition that 
                      the literature of cultural identity undertaken by writers 
                      like Amy Tan offers readers--that moment when readers can 
                      say &quot;that's my culture too,&quot; or can recognize 
                      the value and problems of a culture different than their 
                      own and feel for a moment that they are sharing in them. 
                      The environment of <i>The</i> <i>Disparities</i> is much 
                      more radically and constantly thrown into confusion. The 
                      narrator of these poems, far from understanding who he is 
                      simply by exploring the cultural problems his family faced, 
                      finds his circumstances shaped by a complex series of questions, 
                      rather than answers, about the nature of culture and how 
                      it interweaves with political, social, and linguistic concerns.<br>

                    which the word &quot;landscape&quot; is usually associated. 
                    Toscano's landscape is that of contemporary southern California

                    relocated to New York City), with its material overkill, class

                    <p>Toscano knows that contemporary social struggles all revolve 
                      around contested attempts to shape and define physical space, 
                      to &quot;re-contextualize the parking lot's war,&quot; as 
                      he writes in &quot;Circular No. 6.&quot; At stake is nothing 
                      less than people's lives and how they will be lived.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Replicas of visions, hopes, mores, in short/ Never 
                      has there been such a stalemate,&quot; Toscano continues 
                      in that same poem, and the herky-jerky crush of images and 
                      frustrations make it clear he's been there. Partly, the 
                      landscape in <i>The Disparities</i> is that of the simulacrum, 
                      defined notoriously some years ago by the French cultural 
                      critic Jean Baudrillard--an environment which has been created 
                      to fit a preconceived, packaged image of what life should 
                      be, a place in which the poet, &quot;until a high tide of 
                      revolution comes,&quot; imagines the possibility that he 
                      can &quot;manipulate frames, oil, nullified themes.&quot; 
                      But it is also a landscape in which the simulacrum has never 
                      completely taken hold--there's too much anger, confusion, 
                      and wreckage, too much struggle, for the false surface to 
                      be believable.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>The question that <i>The Disparities</i> constantly raises 
                      is how the narrator can remain responsive to the world and 
                      to others in an environment of this kind. Wouldn't it be 
                      simpler, in fact, to shut down, to close out others, to 
                      go about your business without caring? Thankfully, Toscano's 
                      answer is a steady no; the book consistently attempts to 
                      expose what &quot;Has justly been called Power&quot; and 
                      &quot;begins to become 'city'.&quot; But even if it wasn't, 
                      it turns out that shutting down is not really an option. 
                      Even if you want to believe in the simulacrum, it's not 
                      going to believe in you: &quot;Locus, where? You want assurances, 
                      <i>choke</i>.&quot; If you want to remain alive, according 
                      to Toscano, you've got to respond. But how?<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>The early poems in <i>Disparities</i> feature a long, block-like 
                      shape and sharply fragmented language which constantly disrupts 
                      any clear narrative center to the details of the landscape 
                      he develops. However, unlike much of the contemporary American 
                      avant garde poetry which such features recall, Toscano's 
                      work seems interested in reforming rather than discarding 
                      the notion of person in poetry, although the voice of Toscano's 
                      poems is fragmented and decentered in a way inconceivable 
                      in more conventional verse. The narrative self, rather than 
                      being dispersed by such fragmentation, is shaped by it; 
                      the narrative voice in these poems emerges through its responses 
                      to the phenomena it encounters: &quot;I was (no?) <i>part</i>... 
                      wait, I was <i>part</i>, a part <i>of</i>, look...&quot; 
                      That is, identity in Toscano's poetry does not arise from 
                      emotions or histories or even experiences, but from active 
                      responses--we <i>are</i> the way we respond to the things 
                      we experience.<br>
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                  <div align="left"> 
                    <p>The range and specificity of experience in <i>The Disparities</i> 
                      is truly amazing. It includes the physical facts of social 
                      spaces, individuals and groups and their conceptions of 
                      what they are, the unresolved dilemmas of the past, and 
                      a perplexing variety of ideological constructs that the 
                      narrator has to learn to see and to see beyond. The poem 
                      &quot;Premise No. 1&quot; opens with what turns out to be 
                      a fairly typical day:<br>

                      needed / I'd say/ Though that's not so / but can be more 
                      so / Carnival.&quot; While awareness about different cultures 
                      and cultural issues inside the United States may be growing, 
                      and while it's possible that various groups may achieve 
                      more equal representation in bureaucratic systems, Toscano 
                      doesn't believe that the capitalist simulacrum is going 
                      away any time soon. Would achieving equal cultural representation 
                      inside a management system that reduces all experience and 
                      people to an economic value be the same as real social and 
                      personal freedom? For Toscano, that key difference is simply 
                      another dangerous disparity.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>The last several poems in <i>The Disparities</i> are no 
                      longer large, block-like, and jagged. Instead, with only 
                      several words at most to a line, and not much more than 
                      that to a page, these last poems make the book fade away, 
                      as if the narrator, so present through much of the text, 
                      is drifting out of range. The landscape of these last poems 
                      uses much the same variety of details as the earlier portions 
                      of the book, but an often overwhelming silence has been 
                      added. Does one read this closing silence as a greater calm 
                      and sense of resolve, or a greater sense of failure and 
                      impossibility, or simply as disappearance, a voice lost 
                      to the void? Probably one reads it all these ways, but with 
                      the recognition that the disparity between them cannot really 
                      be resolved. &quot;not apples and oranges/but the fruit/ 
                      of the same carved-up tree,&quot; Toscano writes as the 
                      book finally disappears, and the world he's writing of is 
                      one where the differences between you and me, while desperately 
                      significant, still are found mainly in the scars that gave 
                      birth to us both.<br>
