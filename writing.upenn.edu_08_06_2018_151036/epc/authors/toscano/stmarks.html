                <p><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Mexican 
                  poet Gabriel Zaid, in a recent essay, calls for a &quot;total 
                  <br>
                  poetry&quot;-that is, a poetry fully integrated into one's work, 
                  politics, <br>
                  love life, recreational pursuits, &quot;daily life,&quot; etc.</i></font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Do 
                  you aspire to have your poetic practice encompass and/or spring

                  from all aspects of life and experience?</i></font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>If

                  * * *</font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
                  First, some queries of my own-with &quot;answers&quot; (imbedded 
                  polemics) <i>frontloaded</i>. Aren't poets in the U.S. (where 
                  most of the forum participants are writing from) <i>already</i> 
                  writing &quot;about&quot; everything under the sun? Their cockatoo's, 
                  their eminent third-uncle bassoonists, their filmic (gaussy 
                  or pixilated) rushing rivers, etc- </font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
                  how is this not all &quot;integrated&quot;-or could we ever 
                  imagine it not being so in our lives' practices? <i>Already</i> 
                  there's no writing that exists at a remove. Who's writing on 
                  the third moon of Saturn-is still &quot;integrated.&quot; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                  word &quot;Total&quot; is (curiously) standing in-is an interloper 
                  for, the word <i>Total</i>. [And my apologies Mr. Zaid, whom 
                  I haven't met, know next to nothing about, nor have the resources 
                  (as yet) for integrating you (the complex of your social being 
                  / cultural practice) in the dynamic of the political / cultural 
                  / literary environs that <i>this</i> act is taking place in]. 
                  So that &quot;total&quot; is the sign, in fact, that is being 
                  struggled over, while &quot;integrated&quot; is the conduit 
                  for its spillage (something that is basic rhetoric-as old as 
                  St. Augustine's &quot;meditations&quot;). </font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                  &quot;total&quot; that'd I'd &quot;call for&quot; is the sweeping 
                  surge of How'd We Get Here? (or thereabouts, torquing). What 
                  forces are shaping this all-called up from way back, as well 
                  as their near &quot;total&quot; fulfillment of an imperative 
                  (pre-scribed?) Future. <i>That</i> is what we're in contention 
                  with (continuously), or complicit with. And often both! The 
                  struggle <i>against</i> The Exploitation of our very sinews 
                  (in time and space), against Racism, against &quot;divinely 
                  inspired&quot; tomfooleries, against anti-woman speech/thought/action. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
                  is <i>complexity</i> for me. There's worlds of &quot;integrations&quot; 
                  around all this. And interruptions. And transformations. Forms-oh-kay. 
                  And Con-<i>nyet</i>?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Zaid's 
                  &quot;total&quot; strikes me as a very <i>now</i>-<i>frozen</i> 
                  total. No, I <i>don</i>'<i>t</i> want to see poems read at the 
                  Super Bowl Halftime (public executions). Nor do I want the (alleged) 
                  &quot;daily&quot; raised to any principle, frankly. Poetry is 
                  (can be more of a) directed practice. It's specialized artistry 
                  and social practice. In highly complex (capitalist) societies 
                  it's almost a science as to how to <i>act</i> on that complexity: 
                  A need to measure, calculate-innovate. Poetry can produce abundance 
                  of newer meaning, it can be &quot;ever searching&quot;, but 
                  it is always &quot;integrated&quot; to that other (historic) 
                  sense of &quot;total&quot;.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
                  so the question that stands out here is, what does &quot;a call&quot; 
                  mean for &quot;integrating&quot; that which is <i>already</i> 
                  integrating?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
                  their credit, Nada and Gary are employing (an excerpt of) Zaid's 
                  call as a poetic-political <i>platform</i> for their new tenure 
                  at The St. Mark's-as a tone-setter, or rallying instance. Me? 
                  I prefer it <i>frontloaded</i>, just like that. And so my (friendly) 
                  speculation is that this forum acts to amplify and confederate 
                  several related galaxies of American Poetries of which they're 
                  key activists. And yet, they're allowing a democratic discussion 
                  / instance too, by way of a critical reception <i>to that</i> 
                  process. And that's an &quot;integration&quot; one based on 
                  common cultural work between us.</font><br>
