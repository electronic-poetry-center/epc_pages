                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Rodrigo Toscano's <i>Partisans</i> investigates agency 
                      in a world intent on making us all patients by commemorating, 
                      exhibiting, and instigating resistance to the ideologies 
                      created within the language of capital's culture. The book 
                      is divided into twelve lean ego-less lyrics. Each title 
                      refers to an English verb mood, tense, and voice, for example, 
                      PRESENT PERFECT PROGRESSIVE, reinforcing the determinacy 
                      of language while simultaneously evoking a history of political 
                      struggle. </p>
                    <p> After struggling with <i>Partisans</i> for several weeks 
                      I asked Michael Scharf and Brian Kim Stefans, as we walked 
                      down 2nd Avenue one night, what they thought of Rodrigo 
                      Toscano's work. They both agreed that the sparse unsentimental 
                      directness of Partisans is its strength. Scharf compared 
                      Toscano to Oppen. Stefans rallied back describing the poems 
                      as &quot;muscular Oppen.&quot; </p>
                    <p> I find the work muscular in that it forces the reader 
                      to read beyond the poems into the historical and social 
                      conditions that informs them. The impulse in much experimental 
                      poetry to create resistance to destructive ideologies by 
                      jamming the frequencies is no longer enough to really instigate 
                      change. One now must turn readers into producers and carve 
                      an entrance into the material world were these readers/producers 
                      can create change.</p>
                    <p> The real strength of <i>Partisans</i> is that it resists 
                      the will of all work in capital's culture, even politically 
                      revolutionary work, to become entertainment by working as 
                      pedagogical tool. After &quot;it balked/ it revulsed/ it 
                      said pretty please//but no cigar//So back to irony-ville/petty 
                      bourgeois-ville//round and round,&quot; I went straight 
                      to my bookshelf and pulled out Benjamin's <i>Reflections</i> 
                      to read my favorite essay, &quot;The Author As Producer.&quot; 
                      Benjamin's investigation into a poet's revolutionary intentions 
                      reinforces the questions raised in <i>Partisans</i>. &quot;For 
                      we are faced with the fact...that the bourgeois apparatus 
                      of production and publication can assimilate astonishing 
                      quantities of revolutionary themes, indeed, can propagate 
                      them without calling its own existence, and the existence 
                      of the class that owns it, seriously into question.&quot; 
                      (Benjamin, &quot;The Author As Producer&quot;)</p>
                    <p> Throughout <i>Partisans</i> Toscano juxtaposes documentary 
                      and theoretical observations with rhetorical questions and 
                      ironic declarations. He argues &quot;for the ability of 
                      individuals to instigate change&quot; while also &quot;acknowledging 
                      the ideological constraints on their ability to take direct 
                      action.&quot; (Alan Gilbert, <i>Philly</i> <i>Talks</i> 
                      5) FUTURE PROGRESSIVE, his most often quoted poem, is also 
                      the best example of this tension. </p>
                    <p>WHAT WILL CAPITAL'S CULTURE BE TIMING (then)?</p>
                    <p>he'll or she'll<br>
                      meet up with you</p>
                    <p>at twos only<br>
                      by threes ending<br>
                      only on tuesdays<br>
                      the second one of each month<br>
                      during the fall<br>
                      but call twice or thrice<br>
                      to confirm...</p>
                    <p>WHAT WILL MANUFACTURED SPACE BE DEFINING (then)?</p>
                    <p>Not only does the above passage illustrate Toscano's questioning 
                      of agency, an individual's potential to gain power, create 
                      change, and to be responsible but it perfectly exemplifies 
                      the muscular sparseness that Scharf and Stefans find in 
                      his work.</p>
                    <p> That <i>Partisans</i> is only 55 pages allows the reader 
                      to read it often and to use it as an entrance to and from 
                      the material world. I suggest listening to the news then 
                      read <i>Partisans</i>, reading the newspaper then read <i>Partisans</i>, 
                      pick up another book then read <i>Partisans</i>, walk away 
                      then read <i>Partisans</i>, read a historical text, and 
                      then read <i>Partisans</i> again. The week I finished reading 
                      <i>Partisans</i> thousands of activists arrived in Washington, 
                      D.C. with the intention of closing down the World Bank and 
                      the I.M.F. proving that there is still access available 
                      to change the material world. I listened to speakers on 
                      Pacifica Radio talk about Western nations taking responsibility 
                      for slavery, how the World Bank encourages violence, and 
                      death on the installment plan. The perfect context to engage 
                      with the struggles extant in <i>Partisans</i>.<br>
