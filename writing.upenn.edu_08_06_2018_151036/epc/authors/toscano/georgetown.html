                  the impulses animating the making of poetry, one assumption 
                  that holds good is that the poem has some describable relation-of 
                  critique, indifference, support, reflection, determination-to 
                  the society in which the writer lives&#133;.so then, in the 
                  spirit of Brecht, this symposium will seek to prompt opinion 
                  &amp; reflection from poets on the sociality of art&#133;thinking 
                  America broadly as the site of<i> imperium</i> and fluctuation-fissures-in 
                  the meaning of &quot;our&quot;: poetry in our America.&quot;</font></p>

                  <font size="2"><b>1. Two attempts at crossing the &quot;extra-literary&quot; 
                  and &quot;intra-literary&quot; social divide (both ways, without 
                  the customary bribery posing as mutual-aid).</b></font></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                  working-poet side of me, that is, the side that'll have to inevitably 
                  return to specifying a constitutive social perspective, one 
                  that is evidenced through numerous lexical, syntactical and 
                  structural values in the poem-that side, will have to make a 
                  multitude of discriminations that lead to concrete choices-that 
                  side: would like to speak&#133;like this:</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Every 
                  line (or sentence) of poetry having more than one word in it, 
                  presents a &quot;border&quot; problematic. The crossing, for 
                  example, from the &quot;I&quot; (subject) to a specific (socially-accented) 
                  verb, is at once a mutual ideological co-determination, as it 
                  is a perilous and unpredictable grazing up against, or perhaps 
                  it is an inspection-<i>one</i> of the <i>other</i>. And then, 
                  the on-towards the (quote) &quot;resolving&quot; object (direct 
                  social, or indirect social)-further complicates matters. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
                  persistent question: what lies on either side-of a (singular) 
                  word. And perhaps, exaggerated-sounding to some, I often ask, 
                  what &quot;borders&quot; reside within a <i>single</i> word. 
                  And even deeper on that path, my working-poet compeers spurn 
                  me on to more acute observations-for example, Myung Mi Kim (who 
                  is here present among us) who's often asked, what might resonate 
                  inside a <i>single syllable</i>&#133;across oceans, decades, 
                  geo-regional cultures&#133;in that she's figured the very syllable 
                  of a word as being a significant, as well as signifying border 
                  problematic.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Again, 
                  this is the working-poet side of me, needing to pose it like 
                  this: this on-towards the object (direct social, or indirect) 
                  of this grammatical sentence (of power, or deliverance from 
                  power) &lt;quote&gt; 'resolved' &lt;quote&gt; 'suspended'&lt;quote&gt; 
                  'transformed'&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  And conversely, or rather, in addition to the working-poet side 
                  of me, is the social-actor, which seems to want to say, &quot;No-<i>nuh 
                  uh</i>&quot;&#133;that's too limiting, politically, to talk 
                  about textual crossings and the like. My having reservations 
                  about these alleged initiations, and summoning into beings of, 
                  The Audience, as through determinative selections made in the 
                  composition of a text. Hasn't The Audience, instead, come of 
                  its <i>own</i> accord (through the winding paths of history) 
                  and why would it need to be brought into &quot;play&quot; or 
                  &quot;methodologically-textually jiggled into being&quot;&#133;the 
                  dynamization of the audience-unit (me)-has already happened&#133; 
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
                  yet, admittedly [the social-actor continuing] I have my <i>own</i> 
                  borders to contend with, as evidenced by the continuous non-ending 
                  discussion of the very existence of this &quot;social side.&quot; 
                  For example: most left critical journals, like the New Left 
                  Review, The Monthly Review, and the like, will not submit easily 
                  (if at all) to talking about poetry's inner workings, even if 
                  those poetries claim to be revealing of manifest &quot;outer 
                  social&quot; dynamics. And, it's true, as you say, working-poet 
                  (that is, I concur) that most poetry journals around the country 
                  would not (and <i>do not</i>) put up with the ideological analytical 
                  mode such as I prefer to work in. </font></p>

                  Social Actor, continues&#133;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Wouldn't 
                  the <i>cumulative</i> lexicon of someone's poetry-or even the 
                  cumulative lexicon of an entire scene's poetry register, more 
                  or less, its target audiences? Similarly, might not a socio-linguistic 
                  survey of poetry audiences reveal what particular coding is 
                  being drafted upon what population's <i>foreheads</i>. We used 
                  to say, in the County Mental Health Department in San Francisco&#133;&quot;this 
                  population, that other population&#133;a <i>new</i> population 
                  is <i>bleeding</i> onto that <i>other</i> population&quot; </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;<i>Target 
                  audiences</i>?&quot; exclaims the working-poet. &quot;Look, 
                  at the very moment you release your volitional bows, the hundred 
                  arrows (signs) that you let fly immediately stick in <i>three</i> 
                  hundred unforeseen targets. I mean the texture or lived-stratification 
                  of modern social life-well, it's smarts in'it? That is, it doesn't 
                  easily allow so linear a concept as &quot;target audience&quot; 
                  to live, in such a purified state. Aren't you more likely to 
                  be describing the contours or charged boundaries between one 
                  crowd and the other; as you yourself said, &quot;a population&#133;<i>bleeding</i> 
                  onto another one&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Okay, 
                  okay,&quot; then says The Social-Actor. &quot;But let's not 
                  get<i> too</i> excited by these pomographies&#133;there <i>is</i> 
                  a distillation at the end of the day&#133;an indecorous cattle-call

                  there such a thing as an <i>extra</i>-literary audience (in 
                  this society)? Some might say, &quot;Yes, my parents are such 
                  an audience, my neighbors, my co-workers, my (as yet, unlearned) 
                  students&#133;&quot; </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
                  wouldn't &quot;extra-literary&quot; in this society mean that 
                  the population in question, for example, hasn't watched TV-<i>at 
                  all</i> (been formed by it) and the same with movies. On most 
                  TV sets these days, you can even enable the settings to see 
                  the transcripts. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Juliana 
                  Spahr (who is present with us here also) seems to have taken 
                  this perspective to heart (or gut) in her book, Response. In 
                  that book, she treated talk shows, their <i>literary</i> strategies, 
                  as if they <i>were</i> &quot;for real&quot; (live) literary 
                  methodologies. And so, I'm still asking, what <i>extra</i>-literary 
                  audience that we're sometimes accused of ignoring, speaking 
                  down to, can we really point to in this society (literacy problems 
                  notwithstanding).</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
                  yet, at the same time, can we, as literaryists count on such 
                  as thing as an <i>intra</i>-literary audience? Paradoxically, 
                  I'd answer no. People <i>move</i> in the world of social relations, 
                  and spaces-in regions that are both pre- and post-linguistically 
                  patrolled; that is, the body, perhaps might still be the ultimate 
                  border detection device. (Who is more likely (racially) to be 
                  the target of surveillance at a Mall, who is judged on body 
                  shape or size for a job, for example.) </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, 
                  what we <i>can</i> count on is a Border Problematic when it 
                  comes to language&#133;and maybe that's <i>a premise</i> by 
                  which we can begin this tour.</font></p>

                  only from a lack of relevant (democratically arrived at) information, 
                  but also a crises as to how to act on that world-at-large-<i>culturally</i>,

                  is already ranging widely over all sorts of meaning-making constructs 
                  that, in multifarious ways, are mediating life-structures (however

                  <i>perspective</i> that allows for the engagement of different 
                  levels of negative receptivity, the healthy number and degree 
                  of negativities that any audience brings with it&#133;each person 
                  with his or her chest full of <i>this-vs.-that's.</i> </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
                  perspective requires an active engagement of historical unevenness, 
                  an intention to mediate it and translate between, so as to have 
                  a larger (historical) <i>sweep</i> become palpable-more enticing-even 
                  sensual, as regards the conjured-up life-structures and the 
                  cultural practices that surround them. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Implicit 
                  to such a practice is the awareness that one is <i>already</i> 
                  adapting to, and challenging, and transforming, various aspects 
                  of inter-related (resistive) poetries. The task is then how 
                  to avoid enforcing Uneven Development by exacerbating its Uneven 
                  Cultural Terrain, treating it as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;unavoidable.&quot; 
                  The question is how to work consciously <i>from</i> it-as <i>through</i> 
                  it-and yet not &quot;beyond&quot; it, but at the same time, 
                  decidedly <i>aiming</i> for that. </font></p>
