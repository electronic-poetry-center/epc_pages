Here's <a href="febmorn.html">a
poem I wrote in memoriam for Larry Eigner</a> on the day before the
funeral.  It was a silvery rainy morning when I wrote the poem; the
next day, the day of the funeral, was clear and blue and with a copper
hawk soaring high above the grave.  I said a few words, which will
appear in Sulfur, and put a copy of this poem into the grave.
McNaughton, Greiner, Foley, and others were there.  <p>

	Kush did a video on the funeral ceremony and then a video tour
of Eigner's house which is at the end of the tape.  Eigner's home is a
maelstrom of decaying papers, but glimmering with the underlying
creative order.  The home looks like the end of the universe and
Spring at the same time.  Maybe that's what we all are.
