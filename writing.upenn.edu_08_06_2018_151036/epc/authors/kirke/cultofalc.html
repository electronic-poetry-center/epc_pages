<h2>THE CULT OF THE ALCOHOLIC</h2>

<h3>By Alexis Kirke</h3>


<p>

Plumbing the depths of sanity, I raised my eyes to the Great Bear. The
horizon's after-image bisected the pole-star. Sky to Sky was a
crossing of darkness to light: the night pinned down the city lights -
the day walled in by dark clouds. Sitting in my room typing this, the
air is alive with swirling transparencies. Late at night, when I walk
in the park above the city, I am unsure as to whether I see frogs
hopping to the right of me. The solstice is a whirling of fuzzy dark
snakes from horizon to horizon. A friend of mine once threatened his
brother with a broken neck, unless he said the walls <I>were</I> being torn
apart. I never saw the walls go, but I saw the sky rise and the clouds
retreat. It is as easy to mistake vision for reality as it is to
mistake information for truth. The Internet is a great bringer of
hallucinations: taking my eyes from the screen, I see screens in the
walls all around me. Closing my eyes brings explosions. Make no
mistake: I am happy.
