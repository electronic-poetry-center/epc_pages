<h2>THE ECSTACY OF FLOCKING</h2>
<h3>By Alexis Kirke</h3>
<br>

gulls like white wasps<br>
swarm a black canvas<br>
soon the sun is a mist<br>
on the ocean's photography.<br>
<br>
                *<br>
<br>
he said:<br>
"_we_ are seagulls" and<br>
"feeling your fingernail<br>
slipping between<br>
<br>
the two white feathers<br>
just near my triangle-bony<br>
like-shoulder, is lovely". I rub<br>
in and out and my fingertip<br>
<br>
patterns catch ends of the<br>
fibres that make up his wings.<br>
Then I slip my hand in, up to my<br>
wrist, so his wing bone encircles<br>
<br>
it. Feel the stroke of the down<br>
on my whitening forearm.<br>
<br>
Now winter approaches - and<br>
wings hit the sea like a<br>
<br>
tiger's fur rises in <br>
winds of good odours - he's<br>
landing himself between ripples<br>
of Gulf streams that flow<br>
<br>
in a vein through my underarm,<br>
where his finger slips around<br>
searching like digging a hole<br>
in an animal<br>
<br>
                *<br>
<br>
_His_ <br>
wings are an engram, a seagull<br>
that shoots itself over a page.<br>
wings, are their own DNA<br>
<br>
they are gulls in themselves,<br>
store a pattern of flight<br>
from spine to splice.<br>
<br>
Wings are Down, fill up a cover<br>
where hot bars of morning<br>
are focused by curtain-cracks<br>
over the bed:<br>
<br>
the rush of the sun rising<br>
over a city too hot for seagulls.<br>
<br>
                * <br>
<br>
He said<br>
"Your throat and your mouth<br>
were an inside-out syringe<br>
injecting your stomach with<br>
white birds."<br>
<br>
                *<br>
<br>
The complexification of gulls<br>
has two parts. Gulls are vectors -<br>
constantly turning and merging<br>
in subspaces of their own choice.<br>
<br>
The real part is flying in heaven;<br>
and out on the cliffs<br>
the imaginary part is catching its<br>
fish with the flock.<br><br>
