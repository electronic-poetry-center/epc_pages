<b>CONCERNING A CLOSE FRIEND</b> <p><br>

He tells stories that, without themselves interrupting silence, suggest
silence to others.  Since no one responds, he thinks his listeners are
deaf.  Or else mute.<p>

There are incomparable things in his stories -- precipices, Charlie
Parker,
holes, Sucette, Buicks, Boris, X's, Moinous, gaps, Old Man, Noodles,
saxophones, and much more, sex and masturbation, love -- and then passages
that are irritatingly fastidious, artificial, almost dishonest. <p>

It is hard to know what to think of him.  He is so absolutely caught up in
his own form that he becomes its slave as often as not.  Like fire, he
delights in his own form.  Some of his digressions invade whole pages like
a liquid mass.  He creates every kind of clumsy equilibrium, charming
trembling equilibrium, and then suddenly nothing, a hole, a gap, a detour,
while the arms of the  balance remain wedged for a moment in a perfect
horizontal line before collapsing into another chaos waiting for the shape
of another chaos, and to think that I have to contemplate this for years
and years to come yet.<p>

He makes little scratches on the paper to indicate absence.  He thinks
that absence cannot be said.  And yet he eliminates, deletes, erases the
superfluous to try to speak absence.  Or rather to make absence speak.<p>

He is incorruptible, uninjurable, unchangeable in his effrontery, his
cunning, his wonderment.<p>

He is.  He exists in one and the same way.  He is in every way like
himself.  Or is it the reverse?  Unlike himself.  In no way can he be
injured or changed.  He is not subject to  time.  He cannot at one time be
other than at another.<p>

He is here all the time.  He always manages to be present, one way or
another.  He is hard as stone.  As uncatchable as the wind.  As evasive as
water. He never gives up.  Never compromises. So he claims.  He's
stubborn.  So stubborn.  Comme une mule, disait sa m&egrave;re.  He
doesn't give
a damn about time.  He cannot accept not to be everywhere at the same
time. <p>

If this is the night, he will be there.  He will arrive early, before
everyone, and leave late, after everyone.<p>

He thinks:   Is it possible that I may be a great ... no he does not think
it, he says it aloud ... &agrave;
haute voix, since he says it in French: est-ce
possible que je sois un grand ... ?  But he can never finish the sentence.
He has never finished a sentence in his life. <p>

He notices, rightly or wrongly,  that he has used the subjunctive.  Que je
sois ... Curious, he thinks.  The subjunctive always implies doubt.
Doubt?  Does that mean he will never get to the  end of his sentence?
Always hesitate before the end?  Remain on the edge?  Leaning against the
wind.<p>

He has given up hope because hope is a form of moral responsibility.
Still he remains an incurable optimist.<p>

He knows that it is not possible not to know what you know.  But he also
knows that he often confuses memory with imagination.  Makes no
distinction between what really happened and what he imagines happened.<p>

He sometimes confuses himself with his shadow.  And sometimes don't.<p>

He learned early in life that laughter is always tragic.  And so, to save
himself, he invented the laugh laughing at the laugh.  And then he flopped
among the daisies.<p>
