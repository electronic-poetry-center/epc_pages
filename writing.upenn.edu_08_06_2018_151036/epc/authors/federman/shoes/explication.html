<b>EXPLICATION OF THE POEM<p>

ABSENCE<p>

X-X-X-X<p><br></b>

<b>Absence</b> is the condensed version of <b>all</b> that has been
written so far since the beginning of writing -- the smallest common
denominator.  It goes far into the un-sub-pre-etc-conscious and acts as
fingers behaving like pointers on the writing machine to what happened
once upon a time here now again.<p>

The dashes between the <b>X-X-X-X</b> are at the same time distancing the
four letters from each other and joining them like imaginary hands
grasping each other while being in the line heading into absence.  The
nakedness, the symmetry of enforced exposure suffered by the symbols
mirrors the cold figure of the cross, the <b>X</b>, those two quick scraps
of the pen on the paper of death [or rather, the fingers pointing on the
keyboard of the writing machine] listing absence in abundance.<p>

An <b>X</b> points to an unknown quantity, is a variable, an <b>X</b> is
used to indicate multiplication [how much can be absented?]. Above all, an
<b>X</b> is a sign used to name a person of unknown identity, unknown
provenance or destination [the wandering Jew, the bum, Moinous]. <b>X</b>
is form. Could it also be of importance that the human <b>X</b> chromosome
is a sex chromosome? [A question which may remain unanswered until the end
of the human <b>X</b>].<p>
