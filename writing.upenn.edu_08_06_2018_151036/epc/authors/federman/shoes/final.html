<b>FINAL ESCAPE</b><p><br>
			
how will it happen<br>
the final exitus <br>
will it be violent <br>
will it hurt <br>
or will it be quiet <br>
full of silence <p>

will the sordid images <br>
that have haunted us <br>
be suddenly erased <br>
or will they be replayed <br>
endlessly replayed <br>
in virtual reality<p>	

will we fall <br>
or will we rise <br>
or simply pass through <br>
as one goes through <br>
an open door <br>
to enter a room<p>

perhaps it will be <br>
an escape <br>
another escape<p>

from the little box <br>
where it all started <br>
among empty skins<p>

but this time it will be the final escape <br>
from the great cunt <br>
of existence <br>
and this time <br>
there'll be no gurgling<p>

will the stolen sugar be <br>
as sweet as the first time <br>
and what of the moon <br>
tiptoeing on the roof <br>
will she smile upon us <br>
or remain indifferent<p>
 
will there be words <br>
left to describe what <br>
is taking place <br>
words and silences <br>
or will there be only<br>
cries and whispers<p>
