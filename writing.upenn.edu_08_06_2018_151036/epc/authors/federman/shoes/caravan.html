<b>THE CARAVAN</b> <p> <br>

It was a long time ago, too long ago even for me to remember when, and
from where, we set out on our journey.  Now you will think me stupid not
to remember when or where it was, but remember I was young,  very young
then.  I could barely walk, and often my mother, I think it was my mother,
had to carry me so that the caravan would not be slowed down.  Yes, my
mother was there, I think, and my father too.  For that matter my whole
family was there, yes now I remember, my uncles, my aunts, my cousins, and
even my grand-parents.  I am not sure it they were my mother's parents or
my father's.  But I was not as fortunate as some of the other children in
the caravan.  Some of them even had great-grand-parents with them.  It's
true though that  those very old people did not last long with the
caravan,  it was difficult for them to keep up with the rapid pace of the
march, and many dropped off along the way.  They would lie on the ground,
and eventually, I suppose,  they ... well you know what I mean.  But it
wouldn't take too long before they were replaced by new grand-parents and
great-grand-parents, because time was passing very fast, even though the
caravan progressed slowly, in spite of its fast pace,  and so people would
grow old quickly.<p> 

We had come very far since we set out on our journey, but there was still
a long way to go, my father told me, before he too had to stop and rest
because he was so tired.  I remember now how he sat on the ground, a way
back, and said that he would catch up with us later.  He was very tired,
but he never caught up with the caravan.<p> 

When we first set out on our journey everyone was on foot, but little by
little people began to be tired of walking all the time, and so when the
caravan stopped at night to rest, there were always some people working
late, while the others were asleep, trying to invent machines to make us
travel faster.  Some of these machines were very strange.<p> 

I remember, one morning, I was walking along next to my father who was
holding my hand [this was before my father laid down on the ground] when a
man came speeding past us on a strange looking machine.  It was made of a
piece of board with two little wheels tied at each end, and above the
front wheel there was a vertical  cross sticking out of the board.  The
man held the cross with both hands to guide the machine, one of his feet
resting on the board, and with the other foot he pushed himself along the
ground.  He was literally scooting along, and this way he could move
faster than the rest of us. I thought it was quite an amazing machine.  I
don't remember what he called his machine.  It had a funny name.  But it
didn't work too well, or at least not for long, because we caught up with
the old man, he was old now,  way up the road.  He was sitting at the side
of the road next to his broken machine.<p> 

We stopped to talk to him for a moment.  I remember that very clearly,
because it was then that my father said that he felt tired and that he
wanted to rest for a while.  He told me to go on ahead, that he would
catch up with us later.  I never saw him again.  I don't remember if my
mother was still with us.<p> 

This was a long time ago.  I  just kept going with the rest of the
caravan.  One morning we arrived at the foot of a mountain.  A very high
mountain.  It took a long time to climb to the top.  On the other side we
saw a valley.  It was not a valley like you usually see.  I mean green,  
with a river running in the middle, and tall trees along 
the stream.  No, it was a valley of rocks and sand, a barren valley.  It
was not a beautiful green valley, but still many people cried with joy,
saying that we had finally arrived, and they began to set up camp.  Others
insisted that this could not be the place, and decided to go on.<p> 

I stayed in the valley with those who thought we had arrived.  We slept in
holes in the ground or little caves in the rocks.  Oh! yes, now I remember
the name of that valley.   There was a sign on top of the mountain we had
climbed with an arrow pointing downward towards the valley. The sign said,
The Valley. <p> 

When I awoke the morning after we arrived, and came out of my little hole
in the ground, I discovered that only a few people had remained here.
Many had left during the night to catch up with the rest of the caravan.
I should mention that by then I was alone. I mean, my mother, my father,
all my uncles and aunts, and all the rest of my family had stopped along
the way to rest.  Not that I was stronger than they were, but perhaps more
curious.  More tenacious also.  I really wanted to know where the caravan
was going.  I suppose the people who left the valley during the night also
thought that this was not the right place.  Those who stayed said they
were fools to go on, that it was hopeless, and that surely it was better
to stay here,  at least for a while in order to think and reach a decision
about the rest of the journey.   Something had to happen.<p>  

So we settled down and managed at best we could to organize ourselves. To
survive.  We had our own ideas about the world, about people, and soon we
developed a view on all things, a view quite different than that of  the
people who left with the caravan. We were 
convinced that they did not know what they were doing 
or where they were going, and that by now they must all be lost in the
wilderness.<p> 

One day, when some of us were exploring our valley, we found, hidden
behind a huge boulder surrounded by  fog, a construction.  It was not a
house, it had no doors, no windows.   If I had known then what a pyramid
was, I would have said that it looked like a pyramid.  It pointed towards
the sky. That old dwelling had the shape of a pyramid.  I say old, but it
was even more than old, if one can imagine something older than old.  It
looked as if it had been there since time began, time immemorial, long
before the caravan set out on its journey.<p> 

At first we were hesitant to approach this structure, but when we finally
dared, we discovered that it was impossible to go inside.  As I said,
there were no doors, no windows.  Nothing.  Just the walls.  We were not
even sure what  these walls were made of.  Stone or wood, or some other
material unknown to us.  We threw rocks at these walls,  but  nothing
happened, nothing opened.  In vain we tried all day to find a way to
enter, but it was hopeless.  And yet we all had a feeling that there was
something or someone inside. It was a feeling no one could explain,  but
all of us could not have been mistaken.  Night was galloping over the
mountain in the East [excuse the pathetic metaphor, but that's how I
remember the night coming at us over the mountain, full speed] and we had
to return to our camp.  It was too scary to stay here. <p>  Someone
shouted that we'd better get on our way before it's too late, and we all
agreed.  We began to walk away from the pyramid, but just before it was
out of sight, we heard a huge laugh, I mean really huge, as if thousands
of small mouths were laughing together inside the mouth of a 
giant.  We all  stood petrified for a long time, not knowing if we should
run away from this place, or try once more to find out what was inside.
Someone said, I am sure there is somebody in there,  there is life in
there.  It made sense since only life can laugh.  And  someone else
answered, yes, there is life, but we shall never find out about it, we
shall never know its mystery.  And someone else cried out, I don't want to
find out about it, I don't want to know, I am scared.  Then we all cried
at once that we were scared, and we began to run as fast as we could.  <p> 

It was very late into the night when we arrived at our camp, but we only
stopped there long enough to gather our things.  Without having even
consulted each other, we knew  it was best to leave immediately.  Perhaps,
we were the fools for having stayed in this valley.  We should try now to
catch up with the rest of the caravan.<p> 

When the sun reappeared over the mountain in the East, we were almost out
of the valley.  We hurried on our way, never looking behind us.  <p>
