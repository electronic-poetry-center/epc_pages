<b>ESCAPE</b> <p><br>

My life began in a closet<br>
among empty skins and dusty hats<br>
while sucking pieces of stolen sugar<p>

Outside the moon tiptoed across the roof<br>
to denounce the beginning of my excessiveness<br>
backtracked into the fragility of my adventure<p>

Curiosity drove me down the staircase<br>
but I slipped on the twelfth step and fell<br>
and all the doors opened dumb eyes<br>
to stare impudently at my nakedness<p>

As I ran beneath the indifferent sky<br>
clutching a filthy package of fear in my hands<br>
a yellow star fell from above and struck my breast<br>
and all the eyes turned away in shame<p>

Then they grabbed me and locked me in a box<br>
dragged me a hundred times over the earth<br>
in metaphorical disgrace<br>
while they threw stones at each other<br>
and burned all the stars in a giant furnace<p>

Every day they came to touch me<br>
put their fingers in my mouth<br>
and paint me black and blue<p>

But through a crack in the wall<br>
I saw a tree the shape of a leaf<br>
and one morning a bird flew into my head<p>

I loved that bird so much<br>
that while my blue-eyed master<br>
looked at the sun and was blind<br>
I opened the cage and hid my heart<br>
in a yellow feather<p>
