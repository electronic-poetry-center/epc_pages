<b>EATING BOOKS</b> <p><br>

If it ever becomes necessary for you to eat a book, out of despair or out
of some primal need, then eat the telephone book, for it is  the only book
in your library which came free.  Except, of course,  the books you
stole.<p>

<i>Voler un livre</i>, Voltaire once said, or was it Diderot who said
that, Andr&eacute; Gide said it too, but I know he stole that saying from
someone
else, <i>voler un livre</i>, Voltaire, of course, said it in French, I am
quoting him verbatim, <i>voler un livre</i>, yes I am sure it was Voltaire
who said that, but I am willing to stand corrected if someone knows
better, in any case, <i>voler un livre</i>, that anti-Semite Voltaire once
said, oh you didn't know that Voltaire was an anti-Semite, oh yes, a real
hater of Jews, even though he claimed to be an atheist, does that make
sense to you, how can an atheist hate Jews, Jews are the best atheists in
the world, anyway, <i>voler un livre</i>, Voltaire said, I think he said
that to Newton when he bumped into Newton in the streets of London during
his exile in England, therefore he may not have said it in French, but in
English, yes, of course, in English, so I was right in the first place, to
write, <i>to steal a book</i>,  yes I first wrote what Voltaire said to
Newton in English, <i>to steal a book</i>, but I deleted the statement,
<i>to steal a book</i>, and instead  wrote, <i>voler un livre</i>, in
French, but in fact I should have written, <i>to steal a book</i>, because
when Voltaire bumped into Newton on Piccadilly Square, yes, now I remember
that it was on Piccadilly Square, he spoke to him in English, of course,
because Newton did not understand a word of French, at least that's what
I've been told, and Voltaire when he bumped into Newton saw that Newton
had a book bulging out of his coat pocket, the top of the book showing
just a little out of the pocket, as if Newton had shoved the book in his
pocket hurriedly, stealthily, not wanting anyone to notice that he had
stolen the book, I am, of course, speculating here, but from the look on
Newton's face when Voltaire bumped into him, one can assume that he had
stolen the book, probably in a bookstore on Piccadilly Square, the fact
that  the book sticking out of Newton's pocket was stolen cannot be
confirmed, but nonetheless, when Voltaire bumped into Newton, and Newton
turned to Voltaire to curse him for his civil clumsiness, Voltaire noticed
the book half-hidden in Newton's pocket and that's when he said to him,
recognizing whom he had bumped into, <i>voler un livre n'est pas un crime,
dear Sir</i>, oops, mistake, he said it in English, not in French, yes,
Voltaire must have spoken  in English on Piccadilly Square when he bumped
into Newton, Voltaire did speak English, badly, and with a thick French
accent, but he did speak English, that much has been confirmed, so when he
bumped into Newton and noticed the book sticking out of Newton's pocket he
said, <i>to steal a book is not a crime</i>, oh by the way, the first part
of what Voltaire said to Newton has been authenticated, <i>to steal a book
is not a crime</i>, what has not been authenticated is the last part of
his statement, <i>as long as one reads the book</i>, but if one accepts
the entire statement, regardless of the fact that it cannot be totally
attributed to Voltaire, then besides eating the telephone book when the
situation becomes desperate, one can also eat the stolen books in one's
library as long as one has read those books, for this we must be grateful
to Voltaire, even though he was a bastard, an anti-Semite who hated
Jews.<p>
