at first one could stand in line almost anywhere people didn't really mind
too much if one cut in front of them  though there were always some who
objected when overtaken particularly those who were under the impression
that they stood near the head of the line but even these people did not
object too vehemently since the line was not moving very fast or for that
matter often hardly moved for long periods of time and since no one could
tell where it was going but people waited anyway calmly patiently and
good-humoredly as more were coming all the time in endless processions
after all it was a good line a pleasant line a decent line even though in
places people allowed gaps holes in it looseness and laxness as the line
weaved stretched meandered out of sight thicker here thinner there single
or double file here triple even quadruple there in fact in various places
it was more like a social gathering or a human press as people crowded
around in circles as if preparing for a town meeting or a debate or
getting set for a choir or a game after all with such little progress
forward and so much time to wait people moved about the line up and down
in and out casually and freely stopping along the way to chat with
neighbors old friends or distant relatives cousins or uncles they had not
seen in years all sorts of people with whom one had had dealings or
commerce as the saying goes before joining the line but also to chat with
the new acquaintances made in line as one moved about leisurely from place
to place up and down for indeed the mere fact of being in line seem to
create a friendly atmosphere a sense of sincere congeniality and
solidarity among the liners as they were called therefore those who made a
fuss when someone squeezed past them would be sneered at and even booed by
those being by-passed since the line was endless in both directions and it
was impossible to determine where it started where it originated and where
it ended therefore it was ridiculous on the part of anyone to want to
claim a legitimate place in it or insist on any priority of standing for
what would  be the point of declaring oneself ahead of anyone else that
would certainly be futile yet some people kept moving up the line
overtaking others squeezing in front of  them or by-passing them but
without any hurry or sense of  urgency these people were merely moving up
or giving themselves the impression of moving from one place in line to
another nearer to the head simply for the sake of moving forward without
any specific reason or purpose hoping perhaps that eventually they would
be first in line a vain hope of course because the more people there were
moving up the line the further away the head would be for obviously as
these people squeezed in front of others the further away the head would
be pushed so that in fact a step forward in this case really meant two
steps backward for while certain people moved forward others moved in the
opposite direction falling back in line so to speak away from the head
because frankly they did not care where they stood in the line and so they
would loaf about or mill around in groups in and out of the main stream
forming circles to gossip or tell jokes or listen to the stories which
were circulating up and down the line funny stories about what people did
in line to pass the time or how others had forgotten why they came to the
line and yet continued to wait simply because they had nothing else to do
or how some people truly believed they knew where the line was going
groups could be seen standing around laughing at the curious objects
people had brought with them to the line for instance the bed on wheels on
which an old man was lying in a nightgown and which he pushed along with a
cane as if paddling a canoe just to keep up with the line or the little
desk and chair and even a calculating machine an accountant kept lugging
along so he could continue to do his numbers  as he waited in line ah what
dumb things people do while waiting in line one could hear muttered all
over but it was the jokes especially that attracted most attention and
caused the greatest hilarity one joke in particular kept being repeated up
and down the line the one about the fellow who sees a funeral procession
going slowly down the street with two hearses and a gentleman holding a
huge muzzled dog in leash and behind them a long line of men all wearing
black the puzzled onlooker asks the gentleman with the dog why are there
two coffins in this ridiculous funeral oh replies the man with the dog the
first coffin is my mother-in-law and the second my wife ah I see says the
curious man okay but why the dog oh the dog answers the gentleman pulling
at the leash he killed both of them ah exclaims the inquirer could I
borrow your dog for a few hours well you better get in line mister the
mourner with the mean dog retorts with a large grin on his face some of
these jokes were not very funny but this one kept being  told over and
over because it seemed so appropriate to the situation though some people
claimed they had heard it before probably those who had been in the line
from the beginning and heard that joke when they first arrived for it was
said that the joke was as old as the line itself and it was indeed a very
old line some people had been in the line so long they could not remember
when they first joined as a matter of fact the line had been going for
such a long time that many died while waiting and had to be buried on the
spot special crews were appointed to dig graves and perform the burial
rites but there were also happy occasions on the line for instance people
falling in love and getting married or children being born or birthdays
and anniversaries being celebrated it was very interesting to observe how
the line not only changed shape constantly but also changed mood how it
fluctuated from sad to happy or vice versa and this as a result of the
many activities that were going on in the line so that it could be said
that the line changed moods as often as it changed shape sometimes it was
joyful lively full of playfulness and other times it was sad gloomy somber
anguished but in general the line was calm and uneventful simply moving
along in its ordinary but disorganized fashion becoming thinner here or
thicker there and usually this  because someone had stopped to tell a
story or a joke and a crowd had gathered or elsewhere someone had just
finished telling a story or a joke and those who had been listening were
now moving on or sometimes if there was a tree or a wall along the way or
some other such natural or man made structure that cast a shadow on a
sunny day or gave a bit of protection from the wind on a cold day or from
the rain on a stormy day then people would gather under that tree or line
up near that wall or huddle next to that structure and wait consequently
the line would become thinner and lax in that spot lazy as it were for
there was no great urgency or unnecessary impatience in the line even
though arguments would sometimes flare up about nothing in particular and
even occasional fist fights for no apparent reason simply that someone's
foot had been stepped on and no immediate apology offered and quickly a
shove would result followed by an even harder retaliatory shove and then a
fist would strike someone's ribs or someone's nose and for a few moments
there would be turmoil and agitation in the line until the people around
the disturbers would restore a semblance of order and calmness with
insistent pleas of  please let's keep the line moving and gradually the
line would resume its careless progress as casually as before the
disturbance quickly forgotten and the disturber politely forgiven in
general then one could say that it was not a bad line on the contrary a
good decent honest line perhaps a bit too chaotic but nonetheless adequate
a line to which people could come without apprehension and once in line
without having to complain too much about being stuck there for the main
concern in line was civility and generosity many had come to the line
quite unprepared not having  anticipated the fact that it would be a slow
endless process so that waiting would be in vain just as progress would be
in vain therefore they had not brought with them the essential in food and
clothing to last or continue to last in line so that food drinks and
clothing would be shared generously among the liners it was not unusual to
see groups of people who had never met before eating from the same picnic
basket or drinking from the same bottle or handing pieces of clothing or
blankets to people who suffered from the cold more than others especially
during the night after sundown but particular care was given to the young
and the very old for there were people of all ages in the line male and
female of course and of all ways of life educated and illiterate rich and
poor this was apparent from the clothes and manners of certain people many
races and colors were also present in line but usually these people
preferred to stay together in bunches in remote parts of the line
naturally there were also people of different religious beliefs this was
evident from the discussions and arguments having to do with questions of
morality for one of the major concerns of all the people present was the
morality of the line and when disagreements occurred on this question the
line would become extremely agitated though it should be noted that not
all discussions had to do with morality or theology in some places people
would get together to sing songs in unison while in other places someone
would suddenly stand on a box to make a speech or deliver a lecture and
people would gather around to listen to the speaker or argue with him
there were always people ready to argue about anything for the sake of a
good argument while others who did not care to listen to these impromptu
speeches would shout keep the damn line moving but since no one really
payed much attention to these dedicated liners they would simply by-pass
those gatherings and move on but usually most people preferred the
one-to-one conversation moving with the flow of the line two people would
casually talk about anything in particular where one is from what one does
in life talk about the family about the wife who didn't want to come to
the line or talk about the children or reminisce about one's childhood in
other words the usual banalities of life occasionally one could hear an
intellectual discussion or a critique of the latest artistic fad but it
should be stated that not everyone in line was willing to engage in
conversation many preferred to remain silent facing the back of the person
in front extremely serious in their waiting quietly performing their role
as liners of course since the line moved extremely slowly and in no
apparent direction many people would drop out if not permanently at least
temporarily sometimes simply to rest along the way and watch the others in
line go by or else to take a nap many could be seen stretched on the
ground soundly asleep during the day and naturally at night too however
there were some who complained all the time saying that it was hopeless
that we will never get there but in general most people seemed resigned to
the slowness and indeterminacy of the line in fact some people who had
previous experience with other lines said that in spite of its
disorganization and  purposelessness this was a rather good pleasant line
perhaps the best line they had ever joined and this because of its
casualness and lack of regulations for indeed in spite of its disorder
this line was remarkably smooth and easy going and as such acceptable to
most though many feared that one day unexpectedly out of the blue so to
speak it would be announced that everyone in line should stand in
alphabetical order and this would immediately cause an incredible mess a
frightful state of disorder for the commotion that would result from the
fact that one would have to change place and move either forward or
backward depending on the spelling of one's name would create not only
chaos but irritation and anguish and consequently the line would turn ugly
full of animosity as people would not hesitate to ask others with whom
they had had a friendly relationship for their identification cards in
order to ascertain that they were in the correct place according to the
first letter of their last names and one would probably hear people
shouting to others your name begins with a T get the hell back in line or
someone else would say timidly in a somewhat  embarrassed tone of voice my
name starts with a B please excuse me I have to move ahead of you and it
would not be rare nor surprising for certain people to accuse others of
lying about their names or of using false names just to be ahead of them
consequently this line that had been so good so flexible so decent would
rapidly degenerate into an angry ugly state of mutual suspicion simply
because of alphabetical ordering for there would  be order now in the line
oh yes alphabetical order unhappily <b>a<br>
