<b>THE LOST EPIGRAPH</b> <p><br>

The passage quoted below [by Italo Calvino] [tentatively considered on
11/20/85 as a potential epigraph to a novel then in progress entitled
<b>The Chronicle of a Disaster</b>] was uncovered [8/12/95] while
cataloguing the [handwritten] manuscript of that novel.<p>

This would-be epigraph [which  does not appear in the published version of
the book entitled <b>To Whom It May Concern</b>] reveals the radical shift
in the author's view and function of literature [some ten years
earlier].<p>

It is unfortunate that this epigraph was not included in the final
[published] version of the novel for it clearly reveals how the author [in
this work-in-progress] is renouncing his addiction to the theory that says
that writing is simply playing games with language [<i>arte dolce</i>] and
that he is now squarely embracing the theory that says that writing is an
attempt to say what cannot be said [the unspeakable] [<i>arte
utile</i>].<p>

Had this epigraph [from Italo Calvino] appeared in  the [published] book
[in 1990] critics and scholars would not have been misled in their reading
of <b>To Whom It May Concern</b> and would have understood that the author
[known until then mostly as a chaos-drunk experimental
surfictionist-playgiarist who played gimmicky typographical games with
outrageous  self-reflexiveness] had not regressed into more conventional
forms [as the critics claimed] [some of them going so far as to suggest
that the author had returned to realism] [or what was passing for realism
at the time] and more conventional language [whatever that may be] [all
language is a deviation from language] and that he was now writing as if
he wanted to say something [tell a story] [the real story] but of course
knew that it would never happen [could never happen] [but nonetheless took
the risk of stumbling upon the right aggregate of words] [before the final
silence].<p>

It is really unfortunate that this marvelous [most valuable and revealing]
statement by Italo Calvino did not appear with the [published] book [in
1990] for it does certainly inform the entire oeuvre of the author
[especially its duplicity] [its doubleness]  [not to mention its
evasiveness].<p>

We are delighted [therefore] to be able to present here [today] [with the
kind permission of the author] the full text of the Calvino epigraph
[contemplated] [in 85] so that readers [critics scholars and whoever else
is concerned] may know [once and for all] that the author of <b>To  Whom
It May Concern</b> never regresses in his work [he only transgresses].<p>

Here is the absent-[epigraph]-text by Calvino:<p>
		
<i>Let us attempt a thesis contrary to the one I have developed so far.
That is always the best way to avoid getting trapped in the spiral of
one's own thoughts.  Did we say that literature is entirely involved with
language, that it is merely the permutation of a restricted number of
elements and functions?  But is the tension in literature not continually
striving to escape from this finite number  Does it not continually
attempt to say something it cannot say, something it does not know and
that no one could ever know?</i><p>


It is hoped that this revelation will renew interest in this 
greatly neglected [even forgotten] novel and help correct a major
misconception on the part of the general public [in terms of the author's
view of literature].<p>

It becomes clear also [in the light of this statement] how for the past
two decades or so the author has been working in a form of writing that
brings together [in a critifictional-autobiographical mode] the real and
the imaginary [the remembered and the forgotten].<p>
