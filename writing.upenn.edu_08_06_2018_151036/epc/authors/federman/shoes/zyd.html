<b>BRUDNY ZYD GOES TO POLAND</b><p><br>


Brudny Zyd is invited to go to Poland.  Brudny Zyd does not want to go to
Poland.  Brudny Zyd is afraid to go to Poland.  Brudny Zyd has bad
feelings about Poland.  Brudny Zyd has heard bad things about Poland and
the Pollacks.  But LOT Airline gives Brudny Zyd free plane ticket to go to
Poland so Brudny Zyd can be famous in Poland.  How can Brudny Zyd refuse
to go to Poland.  Brudny Zyd wants to be famous.  Even in Poland.  Brudny
Zyd decides he will go to Poland.  But LOT Airline gives only economy
class ticket to Brudny Zyd to go to Poland.  Brudny Zyd hesitates to go to
Poland economy class.  Brudny Zyd does not like the small seat and the bad
food and the bad service in economy class.  But after hesitation Brudny
Zyd decides he will go to Poland.  Okay I go to Poland Brudny Zyd says to
himself.  Still Brudny Zyd does not want to travel to Poland with all the
Pollacks in economy class.  Brudny Zyd nonetheless decides to go to Poland
because he wants to be famous even in Poland.  Brudny Zyd says to himself
What the Hell let's go to Poland.  So Brudny Zyd is at the airport
checking in at the LOT Airline counter to go to Poland.  At the LOT
Airline economy counter Brudny Zyd explains with pleading smile to
charming Pollack LOT lady who checks him in that he's happy to go to
Poland but he would prefer to go there first class or even business class
rather than economy class.  Brudny Zyd does not tell charming sexy LOT
lady that he does not want to travel economy class because of all the
Pollacks and the bad food.  Brudny Zyd explains to charming sexy friendly
LOT lady he likes first class or even business class because the seats are
so much bigger and wider and so much more comfortable and since Brudny Zyd
has a bum  knee from playing too much tennis it would be better for him to
go to Poland first class or even business class.  Brudny Zyd of course is
lying about his knee.  Brudny Zyd has no problem with his knees.  On the
contrary Brudny Zyd has very strong knees.  If the charming sexy friendly
beautiful LOT lady wanted to he would wrap his knees around her to show
her how strong his knees are.  Brudny Zyd does not say that to the
charming sexy friendly beautiful eager LOT lady he only thinks that to
himself.  Also Brudny Zyd does not mention that he likes first class or
even business class better because of the filet mignon they serve for
dinner and also the champagne and the fine French wines and the extra
bread and the exquisite friendly service from the beautiful sexy LOT
stewardesses who all speak with such sweet and sexy Polish accent.  No.
Brudny Zyd simply asks if possible he be upgraded because of his bad
knees.  Charming LOT lady smiles sexy smile and says Why not just like
that.  She likes Brudny Zyd. She senses he is a famous man.  Brudny Zyd
is so happy he almost jumps over counter to embrace charming LOT lady but
refrains from doing so.  Brudny Zyd does not want to be noticed by the
Pollacks who are waiting in line behind him.  And so to expedite the story
a bit Brudny Zyd travels to Poland in business class.  Charming LOT lady
explained that first class was impossible because she could get in trouble
with LOT Airline authorities but business class is okay.  In business
class Brudny Zyd gets lovely little kit full of lovely little Polish
things.  In the business class Polish kit Brudny Zyd finds a mini Polish
toothbrush a mini Polish tube of toothpaste a Polish razor a Polish
toothpick a pair of Polish slippers and many other Polish things.  But
Brudny Zyd does not use any of the Polish things in the kit.  Brudny Zyd
does not trust Polish things.  Brudny Zyd does not trust Pollacks either.
Brudny Zyd would love to fuck cute charming sexy friendly beautiful Polish
lady LOT stewardess who gives him great service in business class. The one
with the big Polish boobs.  But Brudny Zyd is afraid that his cock would
reveal that he is Brudny Zyd.  On his way to Poland Brudny Zyd is suddenly
sorry that he is on his way to Poland.  Brudny Zyd knows that it is too
late now to turn around.  So Brudny Zyd says to himself Fuck it I'll go to
Poland.  Brudny Zyd hopes everything will be Okay for him in Poland.
While all the Pollacks in economy class are getting drunk on Polish vodka
and making a lot of noise Brudny Zyd wonders as he tries to get some sleep
in the big wide business class seat after he ate the good filet mignon and
drank lots of fine French wine if he will ever come out of Poland alive.
Brudny Zyd knows that many Brudny Zyds never came out of Poland.  Now he
doesn't gives a shit any more if he becomes famous in Poland.  He can
become famous somewhere else.  All he wants is to come out of Poland
alive.  Brudny Zyd is worried that he may end up in a Polish bar of soap.
If Brudny Zyd is given a choice in Poland between becoming a bar of soap
or a lampshade he will tell the Pollacks that he prefers to become a
lampshade.  Brudny Zyd knows from experience that lampshades have more of
a future than bars of soap.	<p>
