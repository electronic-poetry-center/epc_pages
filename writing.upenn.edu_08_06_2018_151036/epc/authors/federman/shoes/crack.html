<b>WHO WILL CRACK FIRST</b> <p><br>

[a conceptual play in the form of a poem] <p> <br>

  the beginning  <p>

<i>a distant hollow voice explains</i><p> 

the situation<p>

two old friends have decided never<br>
to speak to each other again <p>

they feel that the affection<br>
and respect they have for each other<br>
is gradually dwindling away with each word <br>
that passes between them <p>

<i>the voice emphasizes </i><p>

the situation is dramatic<br>
but not melodramatic <p>

<i>another voice explains calmly this is</i> <p>

a play for two actors and two loudspeakers <p>

<i>and that </i><p>

the voices on the loudspeakers are <br>
 the voices of the two actors <p>

<i>a third voice specifies</i><p>

stage dark at first <br>
gradual light reveals <br>
the two friends seated <br>
their backs to each other <br>
one left one right of stage <p>


<i>another voice interrupts and specifies </i><p>

loudspeaker over the head <br>
of each friend <p>

<i>loudspeakers speak alternatively</i> <p>

loudspeaker left tells why <br>
friend left will not crack first <p>

loudspeaker right tells why <br>
he thinks <br>
friend right will not crack first <p>

<i>all three voices together chant</i> <p>

and so on and so on <br>
and so on <p>

<i>first voice explains</i> <p>

while loudspeakers speak <br>
seated friends react restlessly <br>
with bodily and facial gestures <br>
to what is being said <br>
above their heads <p>

<i>second voice emphasizes </i><p>

loudspeakers get louder <br>
more argumentative <br>
more aggressive <br>
angry and enraged <br>
as play progresses <p>

<i>third voice explains</i> <p>

argument  turns to a debate <br>
a competition <br>
a trial <p>

<i>loudspeakers together improvise </i><p>

words of encouragement <br>
for friends to remain firm <br>
in their silence <p>

<i>loudspeaker left</i> <p>

tells that the reason <br>
friend left will not crack <br>
is because he is a poet <br>
and poets know <br>
silence and solitude <br>
poets know that one suffers <br>
 from not suffering enough <p>

<i>loudspeaker right retorts</i> <p>

that friend right is an actor <br>
and actors know how not <br>
to crack during a play <br>
actors have control over <br>
their emotions <p>

<i>loudspeaker L laughs and says</i> <p>

that friend L <br>
will not crack first <br>
because <br>
once upon a time <br>
during the great war <br>
he was tortured <br>
because he knew <br>
something secret <br>
something unspeakable <br>
the enemy tortured him <br>
but he refused to talk <br>
he did not crack <br>
for weeks and weeks <br>
he remained silent in torture <br>
and silence became for him <br>
the reverse of torture <br>
that is why friend L <br>
will not crack first <p>

<i>loudspeaker R counters by saying </i><p>

that anyone <br>
in friend L's situation <br>
would have done the same <br>
would have found the courage <br>
not to crack <br>
it's normal it's natural <br>
it's the rule when one is being tortured <p>

<i>loudspeaker R continues</i> <p>

friend R found much more <br>
courage for something <br>
much more traumatic <br>
though less melodramatic <br>
and he was only seven then <br>
the day his father beat him <br>
with his belt for no reason <br>
slashing at his body <br>
with the leather of the belt <br>
and even the belt buckle <br>
and that day friend R swore <br>
to himself in his pain <br>
that he would not talk <br>
to his father for a whole month <br>
and for a whole month friend R <br>
did not speak a word to his father <br>
and he was only seven then <p>

<i>loudspeaker R concludes forcefully</i> <p>

only a few human beings <br>
can find that  kind of courage <br>
the happy few yes the happy few <br>
and friend R was only seven then <p>

<i>after a long silence loudspeaker L declares </i><p>

that friend L wants to become <br>
a serious religious poet <br>
that is why he can no longer <br>
communicate with friend R <br>
because he is an actor<br>
actors are blasphemous <br>
especially when they make <br>
people laugh <p>

<i>loudspeaker R replies</i> <p>

that friend R can no longer <br>
look and speak at the sad <br>
face of Friend L <br>
because he has just accepted <br>
a role in the human comedy <br>
to make people laugh <br>
night and day <p>

<i>loudspeaker L sings softly</i> <p>

I am Jesus I am Moses <br>
I am Mohammed <br>
I am the Holy Ghost <br>
I am immortal <p>

<i>loudspeaker R declaims eloquently</i> <p>

I am Hamlet <br>
I am Winnie<br>
I am King Lear <br>
I am Phedrea <br>
I am Superman <br>
I am Gogo I am Didi <p>

<i>all three voices together chant </i><p>

and so on and so on <br>
and so <p>

<i>first voice explains</i> <p>

that loudspeakers <br>
can improvise <br>
any time <p>

<i>second voice explains </i><p>

as the play progresses <br>
it becomes gradually evident <br>
that the two silent friends <br>
are growing more and more <br>
restless tense nervous <br>
tortured in their bodies and minds <p>

<i>loudspeaker L murmurs </i><p>

and I saw a mighty angel come down from heaven <br>
clothed with a cloud <br>
and a rainbow was upon his head <br>
and his face was as it were the sun <br>
and his feet as pillars of fire <p>

<i>loudspeaker R recites sadly</i> <p>

All the old ways led to this <br>
all the old windings <br>
the stairs with never a landing <br>
that you screw yourself up <br>
clutching the rail <br>
counting the steps <br>
the fever of shortest ways <br>
under the long lids of sky <br>
the wild country roads <br>
where your dead walk beside you <br>
on the dark shingle the turning <br>
for the last time again <br>
to the lights of the little town <br>
the appointments kept <br>
and the appointments broken <br>
all the delights of urban <br>
and rural change of place <br>
all the exitus and redditus <br>
closed and ended <br>
all led to this <br>
to this gloaming <br>
where a middle-aged man <br>
sits masturbating his snout <br>
waiting for the first dawn to break <p>
                      
<i>loudspeaker L sighs                      loudspeaker R laughs    <p>
third voice declares</i> <p>
suddenly <br>
while loudspeakers <br>
continue to argue angrily <br>
in a cacophony of words <br>
the two friends let out a scream <br>
at the same time <br>
which they keep repeating <br>
with anguish and despair <p>


<i>friend R & friend L keep on screaming <br>
while loudspeakers screech <br>
louder & louder <p>


first voice states</i> <p>

stage goes dark <p>

no applause
no curtain call <p>

     <b>the end</b>       <p>
