<b>NOTES SCRIBBLED IN THE DARK<p>

	WHILE WATCHING SCHINDLER'S LIST <p>

	OR <p>

	WHAT PRICE SCHINDLER'S POTS & PANS?</b><p><br>



Everybody tells me I should see this movie.  Even President Clinton said
so.  So here I am.<p>

I wonder what the German soldiers did with all the Pots & Pans
Schindler's Jews fabricated in his factory?  Did they use them to cook
food or to piss in them?<p>

As the old Yiddish proverb says:  You have to survive, even if it kills
you.<p>

But one must admit that Schindler's Big Deal about Pots & Pans makes the
Holocaust acceptable as a mainstream pop-art movie.<p>

This one is going to be big.  I can tell.  We're talking millions &
millions of dollars here.  Spielberg does it again.	<p>

Oskar is so perfect.  A director's dream.  He brings such class, such
elegance, such savoir-faire, such easy redemption to the ghastly business
of extermination.<p>

Oskar manages to buy 1100 Jews by selling his car, his elegant suits, his
silk ties, his gold watch.  Not a bad trade.  Imagine how many more Jews
could have been traded and saved if the Pope had sold his fancy
limousines, his embroidered robes, his cute skull caps, his precious
bijoux. <i>Deus Profundus.</i><p>



What was the going rate then for a Jew in those days?   A Jew for a pot? A
pot for a Jew?<p>

I like Oskar's suits.  But where the hell does he buy these suits in
Poland?  Maybe a little Jewish tailor makes them for him before being
unmade himself to be remade into a lampshade.  And look at Oskar's
beautiful cuff-links!<p>

This is a great movie, I mean technically.  Since I know in advance what
‘s going to happen, I can concentrate on the technique, the fine cuts, the
close-ups, the long shots, the zooming in.  I can also concentrate on the
costumes and the make-up.<p>

Presentation is the trick here.  Oskar Schindler and Steven Spielberg are
masters of presentation. And both of them are fantastic salesmen.<p>

Interesting, there does not seem to be as much Pop Corn munching for this
movie as with other movies.  This movie requires silence and
concentration.<p>

Has anyone ever studied the semiotic implications of Pop Corn eating while
watching a Holocaust movie?  Maybe they should sell kosher popcorn for
such movies.<p>

It never occurred to me that Jews could be qualified to fabricate Pots &
Pans.  I always think of Jews as being good merchants, good tailors,
intellectuals.<p>

Interesting how this black & white movie seems so colorful.<p>

I wonder how many people noticed, a few frames back, that the coat of the
little girl who is being herded away was colorized red.  A touch of red in
a black and white movie.  What a touch!  But maybe it was a flaw in the
film?<p>

Spielberg should have used more skinny extras for this movie.  His victims
seem too well fed, too chubby, especially the women.  Also, their pyjamas
are too clean.<p>

I found it funny that when I stood in the long line with all the concerned
people waiting to go into the theater, we were being ordered about by a
young freckled theater employee with a punk haircut who kept saying to us:
<i>Schinlder's list the line forms over there, line up against the wall in
a double line.</i>  It was a brazen command that could hardly have been
shouted out by someone who had seen the movie.  I suppose the management,
that day, had to use the pop corn vendor to organize the mass of people
who wanted to see <i>Schindler's List.</i>  It shows that people do listen
to their president.<p>

I wonder if the Lady-Secretary-Whore who was with Schindler up on the hill
watching the children being herded away also noticed the colorized red
coat, or if this little epiphany was only for Schindler's eyes?<p>

It occurs to me as I watch this movie that perhaps I should not be
watching it.  That I am out of place here.  Out of time too.  Why do I
feel so shitty.  Don't tell me it's guilt?  The guilt of knowing that no
one died for me in the camps.  <p>
Yet this sordid affair must be told and told again, and shown and shown
again, and read and read again, and seen and seen again.  I know that.
And I know that I must keep on replaying that sordid story over and over
again in my head, at the risk of being anachronistic, as Primo Levi put
it.<p>

Quand notre sang sera-t-il nettoy&eacute; de la salet&eacute; 
d'Auschwitz?<p>

When will our blood be cleansed of the Auschwitz's filth?  Sounds better
in French.<p>

How come neither my mother nor my sisters made Schindler's list?  They
were there.  I know they were there.  There are records of that.  I am
sure my mother and my sisters would have done a good job in Schindler's
factory making Pots & Pans.  But not my father.  No.  My father was too
much of an artist, a dreamer, to be able to do good work with his hands in
a factory.<p>

What's that sniveling, I hear?  Don't tell me people are crying.  Wow!
Spielberg managed to sentimentalize the Holocaust.  Meli-Melo-drama!   Are
the people really crying or tear-jerking?  It's not the same thing.<p>

Oskar Schindler as a character in this movie seems more mature, more
grown-up than most of the characters I have seen in Steven Spielberg's
other movies.  Usually Spielberg's characters, especially the adults,
cannot suppress their yearning to get back to childhood.  That's a plus
for Spielberg in this movie, maybe he is growing out of his
infantilism.<p>

Still, one must admire Spielberg for making this movie.  I suppose he had
to.  As Maimonides once put it: <i>Every Jew is like an actor playing a
Jew, each gives his own interpretation of the past.</i>  Spielberg too has
a right to his interpretation -- not as an actor, as a director.  But then
every Jew thinks of himself as a director of something.  I was once the
Director of a Creative Writing Program.<p>

Wow!  What a movie!  I mean the style.  It is so calculated.  So precise.
So in place.  So hygienic.  Spielberg is really something.  A master.  But
it's interesting to see how he has not yet found a way of making a movie
without congratulating himself at the same time.  I am not criticizing
him.  I do the same in my own work.<p>

Neeson is good, I mean as an actor.  He has hollow panache, a flat sexy
look, a connoisseur's calm, untidy emotionalism with no core, and that
spacious face waiting for us to guess what he is thinking.  He is tall
too.  He is all seduction.  But I think the guy who plays the commandant
of the camp, Goeth, is a much better actor.  He is more credible, more
scary.  Even the fat around his waist is more real than Oskar's glamorous
looks.<p>

Still, I must admit that the glibness and the beauty of this movie are for
a good cause.  This movie is educational.  And besides, Americans are so
easily moved to tears.  Americans tear-jerk at the least bit of emotional
disturbance.<p>

Schindler's list makes people weep tears of gratitude.  But how can anyone
be grateful for the Holocaust?  Yes, this movie makes people feel good
about the Holocaust.  Hard to believe that one can feel good about such an
unforgivable enormity.   But then this is just a story with a happy
ending.  The Holocaust is used here only as a backdrop to a great piece of
fiction.<p>

Me, usually, when watching a movie, I wonder how they do it?  How they
fool me, how they make me believe that the little boy who just got shot by
Goeth is really dead and not faking it.  After all I heard the sound of
the bullet leave the gun and heard it enter the little boy's skull. I saw
the crushed skull, and the blood, even though shown in black & white.  I
heard that, I saw that.  Or was it an illusion?<p>

It was said that Jews were in third place on the list of the people
Americans feared most.  Germans were first and Japanese second.  This, of
course, was said during the Holocaust, while the final solution was going
on.  Why am I thinking of this in the middle of this movie?<p>

Maybe such events as the Holocaust should never be re-created, so that we
can only judge them, look at them in the way spies look at secret
documents.<p>

Still there is news here for the young and the ignorant, and there is also
the pleasure of great film making craft, alas.<p>

Why am I constantly confusing this movie with <i>Jurassic Park?</i>  Is it
because both movies are about extinction?  Or rather because both are an
effort, alright a vain effort,  to bring back into the light what has been
extinguished?<p>

Stern.  What a name for an accountant.  Perfect.  I like Stern.  But how
much truer the relationship between Schindler and his accountant would
have been if at the end Oskar would have walked away from Stern without
shaking his hands, without recognizing the bond of ... of what?  Yes, how
much more in character it would have been for Schindler to casually laugh
off the whole thing -- the bond with Stern, and the Pots & Pans.<p>

Why do I keep thinking in the middle of all these Pots & Pans what a tough
little great survivor Primo Levi was, before he cracked.  <p>

Can humanity continue to exist without redemption?  No, I mean, can
movies, Hollywood movies really work without redemption?<p>

Spielberg & Schindler -- SS & OS -- in this movie are willing to go inside
the gas chambers and look around because they know they can come out.
Could I do that?<p>

I suppose it's inevitable now that Holocaust T-shirts are going to pop up
all over the place, and also Holocaust victim dolls, Holocaust toys,
Holocaust bumper-stickers, Holocaust Pots & Pans.   Well, all that will
help the economy.  Hey maybe that's why the President urged people to go
see this movie.<p>

Interesting how today the people are staying to read the credits at the
end.  I always wonder why so often these days they give us the credits at
the end?  Maybe it's because at the beginning they want to plunge us into
the action as quickly as possible.  But then a lot of people walk out on
the credits.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  But today
everybody is still here, still sitting or standing, reading the credits.
Maybe they feel they missed something.  That there is more to this
story.<p>

I am out of here.<p>

Oh wait ... wait ... what's that?  An Amblin Entertainment -- copyright
1994.  Now that's interesting.  You mean to tell me that <i>Schindler's
List</i> was produced by an entertainment company?   That's a good one.<p>

Wow was it hot in there.<p><br>

<b>AFTERTHOUGHT</b><p>


Is it possible that during the many visits I made to Germany since the
War, I accidentally passed in the streets of Berlin or Munich or some
other Burg the person who pushed my mother into the gas chamber?  Or that
I sat in a restaurant or at a concert (a Wagner opera -- I am a fanatic of
Wagner's operas) next to the man who beat my father to death with the butt
of his rifle?  Or that in a comfortable first class compartment of the
ultra-rapid ICE train I sat across the former SS who raped my sisters
before strangling them?  Oh what a horrible thought. <p>
