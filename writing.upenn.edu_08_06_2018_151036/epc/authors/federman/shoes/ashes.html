<b>IN THE PLACE OF ASHES</b><p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                 <i>for George Chambers</i><p><br>

Someday I'll go <br>
to the place of ashes <br>
and sit beside the ashes <br>
of my mother and father<p>

I'll sit in the dark <br>
and watch the glow <br>
of the coal fire <br>
through the tiny <br>
mica windows <br>
of the salamander-stove<p>

I'll hold my breath <br>
and carry their <br>
chamber pot <br>
downstairs <br>
to empty it <br>
in the courtyard<p>

back upstairs <br>
I'll sit again <br>
beside the ashes <br>
and try to scoop them <br>
in the palm of my hands <br>
so they can tell me <br>
what happened ...<p>
