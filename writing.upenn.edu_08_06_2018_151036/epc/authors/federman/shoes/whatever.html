<b>WHATEVER HAPPENED TO M & N</b> <p><br>

Hey federman ... wake up ... wake up ... we want to ask you something ...
you see ... for years we've been wondering whatever happened to M & N
after they vanished ... or rather ... as you put it yourself then ...
after they faded back into your subconscious  right there in your old
dusty study ... after M & N described what happened at the space-port and
how the Old Man ... well you know the story ...<p>

Yes we've often wondered what happened to these two old farts ... after
they vanished ... and you fell asleep on the sofa ...<p>

We would like to know what's cooking with that pseudo-couple ... as old
Sam would have said of them ... or perhaps he did ... <p>

When was it we last saw them ... 81 ... 82 ... the year of their glorious
appearance ... or perhaps we should say ... their pathetic disappearance
from the scene of the crime ... hey ... these guys didn't last long ... 82
wasn't it ... what a year it was ... well a good year  for them two bums
... but for us a stinking year ... one of the worst ... do you remember
...<p>

Tell us ... federman ... have you seen them ... heard from them ... have
they given sign of life ... are they still alive or have they already
changed tense ...  no ... those two jokers could outwit death itself ...
we wouldn't put it past them to make it to the apocalypse ... just to be
able to take a picture of it ... <p>

Hey federman ... do you know anything of the whereabouts of these two
chaos-drunk raconteurs ... do you have any idea what they are doing ...
and if they are doing ... whatever they are doing ... do you know where
they are doing it ... and how ... and for what purpose ... are they well
... successful ... satisfied ... are they employed ... and do we dare ask
at the risk of being ridiculous ... are they happy ... if you know
anything ... federman ... anything at all ... about Moinous & Namredef ...
please let us know ... let the rest of the world know... there are so many
of us who were so fond ... and are still ... of these two clowns ... we
urge you to let us know ... we want so much to know ... to hear ... the
rest of their story ...<p>
