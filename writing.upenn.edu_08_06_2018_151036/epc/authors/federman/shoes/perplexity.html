<b>PERPLEXITY</b><p><br>

Born with the legacy<br> 
of incomprehensibility,<br> 
I am aware that I can never
forget,  but also that I will never understand.  And so I am opposed, I
think, to transparent language because language is always in process and
in trial.  I am, of course, anti-closure, anti-completion.  And don't talk
to me about the fixed past.  I do not privilege the essential and
invariant to escape the perils of uncertainty.  Certainly not.
Personally, I prefer chaos, digression, non-directionality.  Those who
claim that the office of knowledge is to uncover antecedental reality in
order to distance the real itself are full of shit.  They are mere
spectators of reality.  If you like the game, play.<p>
