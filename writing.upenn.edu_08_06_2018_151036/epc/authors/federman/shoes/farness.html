<b>THE REVERSE OF FARNESS</b> <p> <br>

No, I cannot resign myself <br>
to being the inventory <br>
of Federman's miscalculations,<br>
I am not ready for my summary <br>
nor rendered to my final solution.<p>

No, I do not wish to participate <br>
any longer -- willy nilly --<br>
in the fiasco of his fabrication,<br>
that failed account of my survival,<br>
abandoned in an empty space <br>
with an excremental package of fear <br>
in my hands, symbol of my origin <br>
wrapped in the wordshit <br>
of his fabulation, that futile act <br>
of creating images of birth <br>
backward into the great cunt of death,<br>
as I regress towards my expulsion.<p>

There must be a better way <br>
to manifest myself,<br>
to assert my presence <br>
in his exercise-book,<br>
speak my own words,<br>
from the reverse of farness,<br>
and reach the margins <br>
of verbal authenticity.<p>

Yes, I will step out into the light,<br>
emerge, run to some other refuge,<br>
survive, speak out, tell the truth,<br>
I give you my word, resist.<p>

I will abolish his sustaining paradox,<br>
expose the implausibility of his lure,<br>
with stratagems, cunning expedients <br>
that will cure him of his madness,<br>
even if the act of telling myself <br>
sends him to oblivion.<p>

His journey to chaos derailed,<br>
his temporary landscapes frozen,<br>
his visit among the beasts forgotten,<br>
his real fictitious discourse denounced,<br>
I will be relentless, his exaggerated <br>
second-hand tale retold anew,<br>
with the correct tone and accent,<br>
his whining plural voice muzzled,<br>
all his words obliterated, erased,<br>
from Cambrian brainless algae <br>
to his imagination playgiarized,<br>
head crushed against the wall.<p>

I will step out of my reversed role,<br>
speak in my own voice at last,<br>
even if I must outstretch myself <br>
to the unattainable.<p>
 
But suppose, suppose fatigued <br>
and disgusted he abandons me,<br>
will I be able to become the essential,<br>
and not remain a special event,<br>
stalled words in distress <br>
without a destination,<br>
an historic fiasco within <br>
his hysterical screaming,<br>
obscured by faulty memory.<p>

Yes, suppose he gives up,<br>
dies one morning, just like that,<br>
among millions of unfinished moments,<br>
in the middle of a sentence,<br>
will I remain suspended to his ink-blood,<br>
lifeless voice within a silent voice, <br>
without a story to tell,<br>
my beginning canceled <br>
by Federman's absence.<p>
