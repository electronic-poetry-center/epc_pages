<b>BUT ...<p><br>

	... think of it  think of it </b><i>... he says to me the other in
me ... right there in the middle of the street ... the other in me ... yes
once in a while we harangue each other ... he & me ... or whatever name we
go under ... Sam & Ace ... B one & B two or is it B plus & B minus ... but
whatever the names we do talk to each other when we need to  ... even if
we would prefer not to ... and so he says to me </i><b>... but think of it
think of it ... what over the years we did ... we did simply  for our own
diversion</b><i> ... ah talk to me about having fun ... I never laughed so
much in my life ... </i><b>as a way to play</b><i> ... how you like that
... </i><b>to enjoy one another's company </b><i>... ah come on say it
direct ... to screw each  other ... </i><b>long distance</b><i> ... yes
that's what it was ... and me all the while thinking it was from the
reverse of farness ... as old Sam once put it ... </i><b>to compete with
each other</b><i> ... damn right to compete ... and remember ... always
... always the small one winning the race ... </i><b>to outdo one another
as jazz saxophonists will</b><i> ... or as  old farts in decline do ...
dueling at sea with their fishing poles  ... remember ... </i><b> think of
it think of it ... how me & you ... </b><i>and you &  me ...</i><b>enjoyed
one another's company ...</b><i> in the great vacuum of creation
...</i><b> to drive off the freaking despair of being writers </b><i>...
that's a good one ... writers ... ah  yeah writers ...  scribblers rather
... noodlers ... </i><b>to do something that meant precisely nothing
</b><i>... absolutely nothing ... as you in me & me in you confronted the
necessity to act in the face of  the impossibility to act in spite of the
obligation to act ... you go make sense out of that ... go ahead ... you
to move now ... you to play ... get your fat ass going and stop throwing
all that shit my way about </i><b>diversion ...</b><p>
