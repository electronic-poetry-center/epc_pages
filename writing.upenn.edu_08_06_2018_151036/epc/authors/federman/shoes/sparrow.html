<b>THE STORY OF THE SPARROW</b><p><br>


Ahmed Soula&iuml;man, a Siberian Tartar, told the Story of the Sparrow to
Vasily Michailovitch Tolmatchoff who spent twenty years in a Siberian
Gulag, Tolmatchoff told the story to Tiberi&ugrave; P&eacute;skuy of
Romania who spent
seven years in jail where he met Mircea C&atilde;rt&atilde;rescu who also
spent seven
years in jail for having written subversive poetry, and while in jail
Tiberi&ugrave; told Mircea the Story of the Sparrow, in turn Mircea after
he got
out of jail told that story to Gezim Hadaj of Albania who after having
been tortured and condemned to death for refusing to kiss the feet of the
President of Albania managed to escape to Romania and there met Mircea who
told him the Story of the Sparrow in a Bucharest caf&eacute; where they
met and
exchanged stories, eventually after wandering for eight years Gezim ended
up in Czecoslovakia where one of his cousins had also escaped, and there
in Prague Gezim told his cousin P&eacute;ter the Story of the Sparrow who
then
told it to his best friend Ivo Hlavizna, a young dissident who had almost
been killed by a Russian tank when the Russian tanks rolled into Prague,
Ivo met Maciej Swierkocki from L&oacute;d  on a train traveling from
Prague to
Warsaw where both of them were going to attend a conference on <i>Ways to
Improve Your Life in the Socialist World</i>, and Ivo told Maciej the
Story of the Sparrow, and during the conference Maciej then told the story
to Jerzy Patkowski, a friend he had not seen in years because Jerzy had
been in jail for twelve years for reasons unknown to him, and when Jerzy,
whom everybody called Jurek, got back home to Krakov he told the story to
Andreij Slominski who during World War Two helped Jews escape from the
death camps, and Andreij told the story to Namredef X, a survivor of
Auschwitz, who many years later told me the Story of the Sparrow, and now
<b>Dear Reader</b>, I will tell you that story, and perhaps after you've
heard it you too may want to tell it to a friend, or even to an enemy.<p>

<b>THE STORY OF THE SPARROW</b><p>
<br>
On a beautiful winter day in Siberia, encouraged by the warm rays of the
sun in a clear blue sky, a little sparrow left the security of his nest to
fly and frolic in the air, but the 40o below zero temperature quickly
overcame the imprudent bird who fell to the ground, frozen, and found
himself buried in the snow where he would certainly have died in an
instant.  But by chance a cow trotted by at that moment, and at the very
spot where the sparrow was struggling for his last breath, she dropped a
large soft cow-dung on top of the bird.  The warmth of this dung-bath
resuscitated the moribund sparrow.  He was so happy, he raised his head
out of the cow-shit and started to twitter joyfully, which drew the
attention of a wandering homeless cat who delicately pulled the sparrow
out of the shit and devoured him.<p>

The moral of this story:  Your enemy is not necessarily the one who shits
on your head.  Your friend, however, is not necessarily the one who pulls
you out of the shit.  And besides, one should never twitter when one is
buried in shit.<p>
