<b>AMONG THE BEASTS</b> <p> <br>

I stood face to face with a bull <br>
and threw stones at his eyes <br>
and struck his back with a stick<p>

I crawled under the rose-bush <br>
which ate my flesh like a beast <br>
until I touched the red of my blood<p>

Barefoot I walked on the cold earth <br>
and fell into a hole full of bees <br>
and all the trees laughed at me<p>

Ashamed I jumped into the river <br>
and let my swollen hands seek <br>
the mud where the dumb fish hide<p>

When the sun crashed beyond the hills <br>
where the shy moon waited legs apart <br>
I covered my face with vine-leaves<p>

Naked I huddled under the house <br>
where rats creep inside the walls <br>
and a fat one came to nibble my ear<p>

On my knees in the barn I watched <br>
the dung drop on the red straw <br>
and flies drown of pleasure in milk<p>

While an old man stood on a stool <br>
loving the cow with a dirty smile <br>
his trembling hand clutching his heart<p>

And again I stood face to face with a bull<p>
