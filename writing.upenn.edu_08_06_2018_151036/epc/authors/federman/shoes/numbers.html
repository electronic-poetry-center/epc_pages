<b>NUMBERS</b><p><br>

it is very important to remember <b>[1]</b> as Jasper Johns so well
demonstrated with his numbers <b>[2]</b> that numbers can only refer to
themselves <b>[3] </b> numbers alone have no story <b>[4]</b> no story to
tell <b>[5] </b> only when they are added subtracted multiplied divided do
numbers tell a story <b>[6]</b> then they have a plot <b>[7]</b>  they
mean something <b>[8]</b> they mean having more or less of whatever one
has <b>[9] </b> more or less of whatever the numbers now refer to
<b>[8]</b>  but numbers standing alone refer only to themselves <b>[7]
</b> that is why the number 9 is so perfect <b>[6]</b> it cancels all the
other numbers when they are added subtracted multiplied  divided one with
the other and  the result is 9 <b>[5] </b> 0 is okay too <b> [4]</b> but
its particular visual quality makes certain people confuse it with the
letter O or with the symbol of a hole <b>[3]</b> this is not so with  the
other numbers <b>[2] </b> their visual quality brings nothing to the mind
<b>[1] </b> concretely or abstractly <b> [2]</b> numbers standing alone
cannot become symbols <b>[3]</b> they cannot mean <b> [4]</b> they are
nothing <b> [5]</b> they mean nothing <b>[6]</b>  they are nothing but
scratches on the paper <b>[7]</b> but numbers when added subtracted
multiplied divided become dangerous because they mark the difference
between those who have much & those who have little <b>[8] </b> between
wealth and poverty <b>[9]</b> between all or nothing <b>[0] </b>
