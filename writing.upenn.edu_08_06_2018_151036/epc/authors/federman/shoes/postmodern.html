<b>THE POSTMODERN ARTIST</b> <p><br>

One day he decided to paint on the walls of his studio everything that was
inside the room.  It was a large square room with a high ceiling and one
window looking onto the street.  First he reproduced the window on the
wall opposite the window, so that now there was a perfect replica of the
window, so realistically done that one could not tell which was the real
window.  Then he painted the paintings hanging on one wall, all of them
self-portraits artfully framed, so that all the paintings of himself also
appeared on the opposite wall but flattened into that wall, and yet just
as well done and as convincingly as the originals.  In one corner of the
room a desk was standing against the wall.  He painted the desk, and the
chair in front of the desk, in the corner of the room directly opposite
the real desk and chair.  The composition and the perspective were so
perfectly executed that if someone had entered the room and decided to sit
at one of the desks, that person could not possibly have distinguished the
real desk from its reproduction.  On the ceiling he painted everything
that stood on the floor, the working table, the chair, the paper basket,
the easel, and himself too, but upside down of course, and yet so exactly
replicated that someone standing on his head looking up at the ceiling
could not possibly detect any difference between what stood on the floor
and what was painted on the ceiling.  Eventually all the objects in the
studio were mirrored on the walls and on the ceiling, including the easel
in the center of the room with the large canvas propped on it representing
the room and the artist standing before the easel in the process of
painting a portrait of himself.  He then painted himself with a smile of
satisfaction on his face standing before the easel in the painting of the
easel he had reproduced on the wall.  Finally he painted himself sitting
at the imaginary desk, his head between his hands, elbows resting on top
of the desk.  For a while he stared at himself sitting at the imaginary
desk, then he walked to the real desk,  sat down, placed a large sheet of
paper on the desk and began to sketch a picture of himself sitting at the
desk sketching himself. <p>
