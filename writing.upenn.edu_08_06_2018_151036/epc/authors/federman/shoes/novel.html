<b>CONCERNING THE NOVEL 
EVERYONE WANTS TO WRITE</b><p><br>

Everybody is writing a novel these days nobody knows why but still
everybody is writing a novel anyway there are those who write for money
and those who write for glory and those who write for peanuts and those
who write for fun and those who write for business and those who write for
nothing and those who write for themselves and those who don't give a shit
if anybody ever reads the novel they are writing and those who don't write
at all and those who are thinking of writing a novel but never write it
and those who once upon a time thought of writing a novel but now don't
give a damn if they ever write it and those who think that someday they
will write a novel and those who have given up writing the novel they were
writing and those who are starting all over again the novel they gave up
writing long ago and there are those who write poetry instead of writing a
novel or who write essays cookbooks telephone books grammars tickets
checks dirty jokes graffiti in shit-houses and naturally there are those
who never think of writing a novel and those who gave up disgusted even
before starting and those who stopped in the middle of writing a novel and
those who will never try to write a novel and yet continue to pretend that
they will and those who have already written one or two or three or four
or five or six or even seven unpublished novels and now write poems or
essays or telephone books or cookbooks or reviews of novels and those who
decided to quit everything job wife kids cars security to write a novel
and naturally those who have never thought they were capable of writing a
novel and yet attempted nonetheless to write one and 
those who knew they could not write a novel but wrote the piece of shit
anyway and those who did not try to write a novel because they knew they
could not write a novel and those who gave up trying to write a novel out
of despair and those who never gave up and continued to write a fucking
novel which they could not finish and those who went at it again after
they stopped and those who failed miserably and those who failed at first
but succeeded later then failed again and those who burned the novel they
had written and others who went on writing another novel after they burned
the first novel they had written and others who wrote novels and kept them
in a garbage can and even though they were no good kept taking them out of
the garbage can to send them to publishers who threw them into other
garbage cans and others who threw themselves into the garbage can with the
novel they had written and others who after years of sweating and bitching
and waiting and writing decided to give up everything and committed
suicide and others who discovered that the novel they had written was not
bad after all and sent it to a publisher who made a best-seller out of it
and then it was adapted into a bad movie and the poor writers were
criticized for allowing  their work to be exploited and others who keep
taking out the novel they threw into the garbage can in order to throw it
back into the garbage can and others who convinced themselves that they
had written a masterpiece and went around trying to convince others of
this fact and others who never thought anything and others who thought
they thought they had written a good novel but nobody else thought so and
others who were not really sure if they had written a good novel and
therefore could not bring themselves to show it to others for an opinion
and others who could not admit to themselves that they had written a piece
of shit and others who gave up thinking that the novel they had written
was good and so on until finally one day [I believe it was July 16, 1999]
the novel was declared dead and so everybody gave up writing novels ...<p>

CONCERNING THE POEM EVERYONE HAS WRITTEN</b>
