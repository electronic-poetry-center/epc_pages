<b>THE RIGHT OF LIFE</b> <p><br>

I am standing at the corner of Main Street & Broadway.  It's America.  I
am alone.  I am watching a group of demonstrators holding signs.  I think
it is a demonstration for The Right of Life.  Or is it The Right to life?
I can hear the grumbling of the crowd.<p>

I am here.  I am alive.  I am well.  And yet I feel sadness in my chest, a
mute poignant ache.  It is not a feeling of culpability.  No!  I have
never understood why one should feel guilty for having survived.  Besides,
I did not really survive.  I am not sure I am a true survivor.  True, I
confronted death, went through it, left it behind me, but it was just an
experience of my life, like all the other experiences I've had.  Jumping
out of airplanes.  Falling in love.  And so on.  There is a word for this
kind of experience in some languages.  In German one says <i>Erlebnis.</i>
In Spanish, <i>Vivencia.</i>  In English, simply <i>Experience.</i>  But
in French there is no single word to seize life itself all at once as an
experience.  One must say, <i>j'ai eu une exp&eacute;rience, j'ai fait une
exp&eacute;rience.</i>  How vague.  My survival, if it was a survival,
took place
in France, in the French language, but I can assure you it was not a vague
experience.  And yet to describe that survival I must rely on a
periphrasis, or else use the word <i>surv&eacute;cu, j'ai
surv&eacute;cu,</i> which is
very approximate, and questionable.  An insipid flabby word. <i>Le
surv&eacute;cu</i> is such a passive expression.  But the experience of
life, the
experience one has of living, that's active, and of course always in the
present.  Life nourishes itself of the past to project itself into the
future.<p>

Whatever the case, it is not culpability I feel, as I watch the restless
crowd before me demonstrating for the right of life. <p>

The right of life?  Who says we have a right to live.  The naked anguish
of being alive precedes the culpability of surviving. <p>

The anguish of being born out of  nothingness results from an irremediable
stroke of luck.  One does not have to have known the death camps to know
the anguish of living.<p>

I am alive.  I am standing at the corner of Main Street & Broadway in
America.  The sadness I feel does not come from a feeling of culpability.
Surely there is no merit in having survived.  I am unscarred, unscathed,
at least in appearance.  The living are no different than the dead when it
comes to merit.  None of us deserves to be alive.  Nor to die either.  I
would feel  guilty if I thought that others deserved more than me to have
survived.  But survival is not a question of merit.  It is a question of
good luck, or bad luck, depending how one looks at it.  To be alive
depends on how the dice fall.  Nothing else.  That's what the word chance
means.  The dice fell in the right combination for me, that's all.<p>

Suddenly, just as the demonstrators start moving down Main Street, the sky
becomes dark.  A snow squall shrouds the crowd, brief but violent.  The
people before me disappear in a white whirlpool.  The buildings, the
crowd, the city, the signs, the sound of the voices, winter, everything is
erased.  I understand now the physical sadness I feel, in spite of the
misleading sensation of being alive, of being here at the corner of Main
Street & Broadway, on this particular day.  It is precisely the fact that
I am not sure of being here, of being alive, that makes me sad.  A kind of
vertigo suddenly carries me into the memory of another snow.  Snow and
smoke.  A serene vertigo, lucid like a laceration.  I feel as if I am
floating in the future of this memory.  There will always be this memory,
this solitude, this snow squall in the midst of sunshine, this smoke in
all the seasons.<p>
