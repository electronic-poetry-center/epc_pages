<b>WINTER WHEAT</b><p><br>


One day, two bums [<font size=2>let's call them old men for this
occasion</font>] went out on a familiar walk.  A good mile through a stand
of old oak, down the steep cut to the sixty year old steel bridge, its
rusting structure suggesting a monument to something [<font size=2>we know
not what</font>], and thence northward along the railroad tracks, in file,
silently [<font size=2>heads bowed, eyes to the ground</font>] into the
fog collecting, rising.<p>



Slowly along the winding deer path downward toward the tracks they went,
each with a walking stick [<font size=2>hand-carved, it should be noted,
for the sake of harmony</font>], in file through the dark woods, over the
wet compact of [<font size=2>dead</font>] leaves, late in the day, late in
November [<font size=2>although it could have been early December</font>],
the old men trudging along.<p>

The smaller, slighter of the two [<font size=2>and older perhaps by a
couple of years</font>] first, leading, the larger one [<font
size=2>larger not only in stature but also in posture</font>] following,
neither one a leader or a follower but rather taking up those positions
naturally, as, for instance, brothers might, although in that case a
competitive tension would be likely present [<font size=2>since brothers
are usually more inclined to be enemies than friends</font>].	<p>
In old [<font size=2>tattered</font>] overcoats, hats [<font size=2>that
of the smaller one greenish, that of the larger one brownish</font>], and
gloves [<font size=2>nondescript</font>], carrying sticks fashioned rudely
[<font size=2>by hand, as already noted, probably with a
pocket-knife</font>] from windfall limbs, the old men proceeded northward
[<font size=2>in truth, more northeastward</font>] along the ties, both
noting a band of green[<font size=2>the fog intensifying its green</font>]
a passing grain car had obviously sown this field of winter wheat, now a
healthy three inch stand, thriving in the rock bed between the rails, and
on the ties as well [<font size=2>if this notion can be
maintained</font>].<p>

The one ahead stooped, pulled a few shoots out of the rocks, rubbed them
between his fingers, then threw them down [<font size=2>correction:
scattered them into the air</font>].<p>

What each man was thinking cannot be revealed [<font size=2>how can it be?
Stream of consciousness went out of business long ago</font>].  It could
be that they were thinking nothing, that the movement, the occasion, was
occupying them completely [<font size=2>nothing is more real than
nothing</font>].  Their walk, then, could have been not unlike prayer
[<font size=2>this is just a wild guess</font>], a form of prayer, a
rhythmic ritual muttering of ancient verses [<font size=2>yes, much
better, ancient verses</font>], verses collapsed into meaninglessness
[<font size=2>yes</font>], meaningless and, therefore, valuable
syllables.<p>
						     But what they are
thinking does not matter much, they are [<font size=2>the shift to the
present tense here is deliberate for the sake of immediacy</font>], after
all, old men, out of the loop of generative illusion [<font size=2>nicely
said</font>], freed to exist plainly in a larger field [<font size=2>of
winter wheat</font>], their lives their own, for a while.<p>

The old men walking along, ahead of them another bridge rising into the
fogbank, and beyond it on a siding, a line of boxcars [<font
size=2>digression:  as he glances at the boxcars the smaller one recalls,
for no specific reason, that in France, boxcars carry this inscription:
40 hommes ou 20 chevaux</font>].  They pass the tail of a squirrel on a
tie between the rails, a complete tail neatly severed at its base [this to
point out that animals too like to indulge in railroad tracks</font>].
Each man inspects the [<font size=2>loose</font>] tail briefly with his
stick, poking at it {<font size=2>it is dry, dead</font>].<p>
The slighter man, wiry, tough, picks up a stone from the 









railroad bed and hurls it at a rotting disconnected telegraph pole.  The
larger man comes alongside and fires his stone at the pole as well [<font
size=2>it should be noted for the sake of accuracy that the smaller man
throws with his left hand while the larger man throws with his
right</font>].  This contest continues until each man has hit the pole
several times [<font size=2>neither man, however, can be declared the
winner, for it was not a competition, just a game</font>].<p>
	
Then they proceed, in file again, but this time the larger man ahead for a
while, then dropping back, taking up the position in which he can keep
himself organized, can keep himself from collapsing [<font size=2>although
the larger one is younger, by a couple of years, as noted earlier, he is
not in as good a physical condition as the smaller one who daily practices
the art of Tai Chi</font>], guiding himself by reference to the figure
[<font size=2>the more athletic figure</font>] ahead, by the cold steel of
the continuous rail, by the tender shoots of winter wheat.<p>

To the man ahead have come a few words, not even a complete line, from a
bitter poem, body words, shooting up, sudden pain from a deep muscle,
<b><i>ineinander verkrallt</b></i> [<font size=2>it could be Celan, but
this cannot be ascertained</font>].  The man pauses a second, half turns
his head as if to check on the other old man.  As he moves forward, the
words form again, in his body [<font size=2>words are not always spoken
aloud by the mouth</font>], <b><i>ineinander verkrallt...<font
size=2>ineinander verkrallt...ineinander verkrallt</font></i></b>...
echoing inside of him.<p>

Near the middle of the second bridge over the stream, the old men take a
piss [<font size=2>they do not remove their gloves to hold on to their
cocks while pissing.  It is a cold day</font>].<p>

Down through the dark stand of oak, following the deer trail, over the wet
compacted dead leaves, the old men went. [<font size=2>Here the return to
the past tense is deemed essential to disrupt the chronology and monotony
of this winter walk in the 
winter wheat</font>].  Down the cut by the bridge they went, and 
then northward [<font size=2>more or less</font>] on a late November
[<font size=2>okay, November it is</font>] afternoon, into the lowering
fog, into the
obscured evening.  Along the railroad track in single file they proceeded
until, beyond the second bridge, they came upon a string of boxcars on a
siding.  [<font size=2>This encounter with the string of boxcars is so
important that no intrusions will disrupt the rest of this paragraph, or
for that matter the next two paragraphs</font>].  These they began to
inspect, peering into the doorway of each open car, examining each one as
if they expected to find something there.  Although, perhaps this gesture
was merely the idle curiosity of old men, old men who gaze without
interest at whatever presents itself, at whatever lies before them.<p>

One of the boxcars was made of wood, like the others dramatically
spray-painted by disenfranchised youth in distant cities, magnificent,
huge dayglo letters of the alphabet so artfully designed as to obscure
their origin.  Into this wooden boxcar the smaller of the two men jumped.
Then he turned and reaching out to his friend he pulled him aboard.<p>
		
Empty, walls and floor of heavily splintered wood.  Both doors drawn open.
Empty, only a few strands of baling wire, flat bands of black steel.
Sitting down, using each other's back for support, the men took up
position.  The one facing the west door, the other the east.<p>

Here they sat in silence for a long time, for an unusually long time
[<font size=2>intrusion:  it is difficult to establish how long an
unusually long time is</font>].  Here they sat relaxed, quietly, not
moving.  Inwardly, as children sit in a kitchen near their mother -- with
mother, as she prepares supper.  Here they sat back to back [<font
size=2>in silence, except for the sound of their breathing</font>], the
fog gathering, lowering, shifting through the boxcar, inhabiting the space
with the old men.<p>


On a rail nearby paused a red-tailed fox, one paw on the rail, the other
hovering, as if feeling something, alert to the presence of the old men,
its nostrils in attentive quiver, its big bushy tail tense, still.<p>

By pure blind association, since from where he sat he could not possibly
see the fox on the railroad track, a few words of a fable [<font size=2>he
once knew by heart</font>] surged in the smaller man's body: <i>Un vieux
Renard, mais des plus fins ... Fut enfin au pi&egrave;ge
attrap&eacute;.</i><p>

The larger man must have felt in his body that something was speaking
inside his friend.  He did not say anything, but with his back he pressed
a bit harder on his friend's back.<p>

Before they jumped down to the railroad bed, the old men tried to decipher
[<font size=2>their one communal act on that day, except for the
deliberate pressure of the back of the one against the other</font>], the
remnants of words cut into the wood at one end of the boxcar.  The closed
curve of a <b>B</b> or perhaps an <b>E</b>, the angle of an <b>L</b> or a
<b>B</b>.<p>

Strange how long they inspected the few bits of words cut into the wood,
bits of letters, bits of exclamation.  [<font size=2>No, there was no
carving of a heart pierced by an arrow, only letters, remnants of
words</font>].  Standing at the wall [<font size=2>squinting</font>] in
the act of study, the old men inspected, much longer than by any compass
seemed necessary.<p>

Then the old men climbed out of the car and retraced their steps, back to
the place where they had begun [up the hill</font>], walking in file, as
before, the fog steady, unchanged, the wind still, things much as they
were [<font size=2>earlier, during the descent</font>].  Along the green
ribbon of winter wheat glowing between the rails, over the first bridge,
then up the steeply cut embankment [<font size=2>the old men puffing a
little now</font>] to the deer path winding through some woods.<p>
			

Then along this path, over the soft wet compacted [<font
size=2>dead</font>] leaves, and then, from the valley came the burgeoning
blunt sound of diesel engines pulling a heavy load, diesel engines hard at
work, that deep powerful throbbing strain of diesel engines [<font
size=2>the old men could smell the burning diesel oil</font>].  That
first, then that, accompanied by the sound of rolling stock, of steel
wheels on the steel tracks.<p>

Impoverished ironies stretch endless as continuously forged steel rails
back and forth, <b>hin und her</b>, back into time and through time to
nothing and beyond that place to nothing more, and to here, to this empty
text [<font size=2>full of intrusions</font>], and then to more, ever
<b>ineinander verkrallt...enfin au piege attrap&eacute; ...<p>
