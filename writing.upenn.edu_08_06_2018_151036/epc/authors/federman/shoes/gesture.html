<b>THE UNDECIPHERABLE GESTURE</b> <p> <br>


There is another place, another room that has haunted him besides the
closet, a room  that contains perhaps the answer to the question that has
driven him  here and now.  
Perhaps all the while he was probing inside the closet, all the while he
was  trying to decipher in the  darkness of that hole the meaning of the
gesture that pushed him there, the answer was elsewhere, in the other
room, the room full of light, for it was not dark in that room, it was
light in that room where they told him to wait after he emerged from the
dark closet-hole, and it is in the light of that room, of that waiting
room that it all started, in that antechamber of departure.<p>

In that room there was a bed and a wooden table, he cannot remember if
there was a chair to sit at the table, perhaps the table was not a table
but a desk, this is not clear, in any case, a bed, a table or desk, and on
the wall, the wall against which the bed was pushed, a picture tagged to
the wall with <i>punaises</i> [how do you say that in English? ... yes of
course, thumb tags], that picture, a representation of a sexy scene
advertising a play, or a movie, a spectacle of sorts,  a glossy picture
depicting a nude pale female body, long and slim, stretched on a couch in
rumpled sheets, a voluptuous young woman with black hair, her left hand
suspended in mid-air reaching for her breasts, her right hand touching the
black hole between her thighs, that's exactly how it was, and there, in
that  room full of light,  with the bed, the table, and the sexy picture
on the wall, there as he replayed the fear in the closet, he saw himself
crouched like a sphinx defecating on an old newspaper, and he burst into
laughter, the laugh laughing at the laugh, he was laughing at himself over
there, crapping in the dark hole, and he knew then that, when the time
comes, all this would have to be told in laughter and scatology, would
have to be told from the light of the bedroom,  rather than from the
darkness of the toilet, yes he understood this as he stood naked between
the bed and the desk looking at the naked girl in the picture, and
reached with one hand for his head, and with the other for his cock.<p>
