<b>THE WORM</b> <p><br>


The problem with the two idiots who started the whole mess in Paradise, I
mean, of course, Adam & Eve, is that they chose the wrong apple.  Those
two naked idiots chose the biggest, the shiniest, the best-looking apple
on the tree. Instead of picking one of the little ones, one of the lesser
apples, one of the less tempting apples, one of those that just hung there
minding its own business, those two dumb asses reached way up the tree for
the biggest apple, the shiniest, the juiciest, not aware that a worm, a
big fat worm was living inside that apple. <p>

The sneaky snake, of course, knew that there was a big fat worn inside the
apple when he pointed with his venomous tongue to the big apple hanging
way up in the tree, and whispered to Adam, <i>that one, yes that big one
up there, that's the one you want.</i>  Or was it Eve who plucked the
apple?  Eve or Adam, doesn't matter now. <i>Yes, this one,</i> said  the
sneaky snake, knowing all along that inside that big apple there was a big
fat worm.  A worm that wiggled like a snake.  A worm imitating the snake
inside the apple.  A self-reflexive snake in the shape of a worm inside
the apple.   A worm symbol of the snake.<p>

That's how it all started, with the snake, the apple, and the worm inside
the apple.  And Adam & Eve, those two jerks, swallowed the worm when they
ate the apple.  Or rather, Adam & Eve swallowed the symbolic snake when
they ate the apple.  And that's why everything is so fucked up for us now.
