<b>LAST NIGHT'S DREAM</b><p><br>

My wife and I are in a foreign country. <br>
Probably Europe.<br>
All the foreigners are being arrested to be exterminated. <br>
This is unavoidable we are told.  <br>
It's the only solution.  <br>
I give my wife a last kiss before being separated.<br>
I tell her she must try to survive.  <br>
We are told that six people from different countries would go at one
time.<br>
I'm asked where I'm from.  <br>
I hesitate.<br>
America I say.<br>
They put me in a group with five other foreigners.<br>
I cannot tell where they are from.  <br>
We are walking in the street in a single file under guard.  <br>
The city is deserted.  <br>
It looks like a de Chirico painting.  <br>
I whisper to the woman in front of me that I will escape. <br>
She laughs.  <br>
At a street corner I run away from the group.<br>
I'm not sure if the soldiers are chasing me.  <br>
I cannot hear the sound of their boots behind me.<br>
I am frightened and out of breath.<br>
I reach an impasse blocked by a parapet. <br>
I look over the parapet and see the city below.  <br>
Yellow fog hovers above the vast sleepy city scape.<br>
I fall to the ground and curl into the fetal position.         <br>
The soldiers arrive shouting and pointing their rifles at me.  <br>
They grab me and tie my arms against my body with ropes.  <br>
I look like a giant sausage.  <br>
Now we are in a white room.<br>
The soldiers push me still tied with the rope inside the fireplace.  <br>
They hit me with the butts of their rifles. <br>
Suddenly I hear a woman shout don't worry we're coming. <br>
I awake inside the dream.  <br>
I'm still lying on the ground in the impasse next to the parapet.  <br>
The soldiers hitting me with their rifles was a dream within the dream.<br>
That becomes clear to me now that I am awake inside my dream. <br>
Still lying on the ground I look up and see four people standing over
me.<br>
Two men. Two women.  <br>
They speak  French to me.<br>
They say they are going to help me.  <br>
I suddenly remember that I know French.<br>
I tell them que je suis content de les voir l&agrave;.  <br>
I get into their car. <br>
A small foreign car which I cannot identify.  <br>
This bothers me.       <br>    
One of the women is driving.  <br>
She's wearing a white dress that looks like a nurse's uniform.  <br>
We arrive at their apartment.  <br>
They explain that they are foreigners and they've been hiding here.<br>
The apartment is very chic and cosy. <br>
The men and women do not seem to be married to one another. <br>
They use the formal vous form when they address each other.  <br>
The woman who is wearing the white dress has two children.  <br>
She sits at a table with them behind a curtain.<br>
They eat. <br>
I am not sure now if I am a man or a boy.<br>
I wonder if I should go sit with the children behind the curtain.  <br>
It seems that the two men are architects.  <br>
They are talking architecture. <br>
After a while I doze off inside my dream. <br>
When I awake the men tell me I can stay with them in the apartment.<br>
I'll sleep on a cot in a corner of the livingroom.<br>
I should not go out or I'll get caught they say.<br>
One of the women asks what I would have done had they not come. <br>
I reply I would have walked towards the border until I reached freedom.
<br>
She laughs.<br>
She tells me I would not have made it.  <br>
The men are now discussing the false papers I must get. 
They say I have to choose a new name for myself. <br>
I suggest Julien Sorel.  <br>
They say it's too obvious. <br>
What about Julien Sore I say just Julien Sore.  <br>
That's okay they say.<br>
Julien sore.  <br>
Good.<br>
One of the men goes out to get my false papers. <br>
I assume my new identity. <br>
After I got my new papers someone says let's go out for a walk.  <br>
The streets are full of soldiers who are looking at us suspiciously.  <br>
We decide to go back to the apartment.<br>
One of the men says we'll wait here until the end of the war.<br>
He seems to be the leader.  <br>
I tell my French saviors that we must leave immediately.<br>
If we stay we'll all be arrested and exterminated I say.  <br>
They argue that on the contrary if we leave the apartment we'll get
caught.<br>
I tell them we won't because I already know that we'll survive.<br>
They look puzzled.<br>
I explain that I already know what is going to happen.<br>
I have dreamt this dream before I tell them.  <br>
I tell them the war will end in May 1945.<br>
The Americans will drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima.<br>
Thousands and thousands of people will die.<br>
Hitler will kill himself.<br>
The enemy will surrender.<br>
All of us will be free.  <br>
They do not seem to believe that I already know all this. <br>
One of the men puts his finger to his temple to indicate that I am crazy.
<br>
When I awake it is the 15th of May 1996.<br>
My wife is asleep next to me.       <p>
