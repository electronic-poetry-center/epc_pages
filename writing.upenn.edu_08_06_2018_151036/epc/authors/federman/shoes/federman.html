<b>FEDERMAN</b><p><br>

Federman loves his name, if only because it's another word that he can
play with.   Federman loves to play.  He plays with anything he can get
his hands on.  If there is nothing there, then he plays with his name. <p>

When someone notes that it is a strange family name for a Frenchman, he
points out that his father's family was Russian.  That's what he says, but
he's not sure himself if it's correct, because Federman often confuses
Poland with Russia in his mind as well as in his writing.  Federman never
studied geography when he was in school, he never got to that subject, he
was forced out of school, for reasons which Federman is always reluctant
to elucidate.<p>

Federman never seems to notice that Federman is a pretty strange name for
a Russian, too. [How ignorant can a guy be?]<p>

The name Federman is a polylingual pun. <i>Feder</i> is German for
<b>feather</b>, and so <i>Federmann</i> would be <i>featherman</i> --
<i>der Mensch von Feder</i>.  In French, since Federman often speaks to
himself in French, <i>feather</i> is <i>plume</i> which, of course, is
also <i>pen</i> or <i>porte-plume</i> -- but that's too obvious.<p>

By a rather roundabout linguistic route [known as the leapfrog technique]
Federman becomes the <i>penman [homme de plume</i> for those who know him
only in French, 
<i>hombre de la pluma</i> for those who know him  in Spanish]. <i>The
Penman</i>, a very joycean name which contains within it Federman's
vocation as a kind of etymological guarantee.  No, rather, a very
beckettian name,  because of  the cringing scatological humor that
surfaces from this transatlantic leap into the reverse of farness, as Old
Sam Beckett once put it. <b>Farterman</b>, as some of his friends call
him.<p>

<b>Federman</b> -- a name, a pun that contains within it not only his
vocation, but Moinous' misfortunes, too.   <b>Moinous</b> --  the secret
name Federman gives himself when he pretends to be a spy, or a musketeer,
or a paratrooper, or a jazz musician, or a French lover, or an
experimental writer.<p>

Yes, that's what Federman sometimes calls himself, <b>Moinous</b>, and if
you ask him, who is Moinous? he tells you: oh just a word, a name I made
up.  It means, me/us.  By the way, it's also the name on the license plate
of his wife's car.<p>

His wife, when  people ask her, who is Moinous? always answers: Moinous!
That's the guy who bought the car. <p>

Moinous is o-m-i-n-o-u-s. <p>

But the <i>feder/feather/plume/moinous/etc.</i> also has about it a sense
of flight, of voltigement and lightness, a birdlike quality, of escape, of
escapade, of disappearance and reappearance within itself, of being both
present and absent at the same time.  Of being here and elsewhere and
everywhere.  Now and always and forever.<p>

From <i>Federman</i> to <i>Namredef</i> [another name Federman is 
fond of using] there is but a stroke of the pen -- <i>la plume</i> -- yes,
a little reverse twist of the wrist, and  voil&agrave;, Federman is here
and
there at the same time, laughing madly because, once again, Federman
succeeded in doing a little linguistic somersault in his own name.  A
great leapfrog over the Atlantic.  That's how much Federman loves his
name.<p>

He would do anything for it, anything to preserve it, even if it means
breaking his neck doing  linguistic somersaults within his own name.
That's how flexible the name Federman is.<p>

After all, Federman will tell you, my father was not only a Russian, he
was a Russian Cossack.  Perhaps the only Jewish Cossack in the entire
Russian Cossack Army ever.  And in Russian they called my father: Dimitri
Fyodor Konstantin Merdov Ivanovitch Federmanov.<p>

And he will even tell you that one of his ancestors was nobility, the
Baron Nicolas von Federman, a 16th century German Conquistador, who died
an unfortunate death by drowning while paddling a rowboat down some
infested river in the jungles of the New World -- a rowboat full of
treasures, gold, precious stones, ancient statues, bibelots, even money,
or whatever rare currency was used for money in those days.  Yes,
Federman's glorious ancestor, Le Baron Nicolas de F&eacute;derman, as he
was
known in France when he resided at the court of Henry IV, before he sailed
to the New World in conquest of fame and fortune, drowned rowing down some
infested river in the jungles of some yet unnamed country.  That's what
Federman will tell you, if you ask him where the name Federman comes from,
and what it means. <p>

His wife [whose name shall not be investigated today, a name loaded with
beautiful possibilities -- <b>Hubscher</b> was her maiden name, which
means more beautiful] always tells him that Federman does not mean Penman,
that it has nothing to do with <i>la plume</i> and his vocation as a
writer, that the name simply came from what his ancestors  were doing back
in the old country.  And what were Federman's ancestors doing in the old
country? his wife explains, plucking chicken feathers in the steppes of
Russian or the Ghettos of Poland.  That's all you are, his lovely wife
always tells him [not sarcastically, not meanly, <b>no</b>, on the
contrary, gently, lovingly, affectionately] --  a featherplucker.<p>

But Federman gets mad when people call him a featherplucker.  I would
prefer to be a chickenfucker than a featherplucker, he shouts angrily at
them.  And he really means it.<p>

That's how much Federman loves his name.   Federman would kill the guy who
would fuck with his name.<p>

He gets so mad when in the German Press [where his name often appears
because of his reputation as a famous <i>Schriftsteller</i> -- yes,
Federman is a famous writer in Germany, that's the cringing irony of his
life] they spell  Federman<b>n</b> with an extra <b>n</b>.  That really
bugs him to be so easily assimilated into German Kultur -- with a
<b>K</b>.<p>

Federman is proud of his name.  Even if you offered him a million dollars,
ten million dollars, he would not sell you his name, he would not change
it.  That's how proud he is of his name, how much he respects his own
name.  But Federman is worried, because he is the last Federman in his
family.  The end of the line.  All the other Federmans have already
changed tense.  And Federman has no son by that name. <p>

Ah, but he has a daughter, and his daughter -- the kid as he calls her, or
puce, or pipsy, or mademoiselle Federman,  or Professor Federman [yes,
Professor Federman, his lovely daughter is also a professor, but that's
another story which has nothing to do, or perhaps has everything to do
with the name Federman] -- even though she is now old enough to tell
Federman what she thinks of him [and she often does], his daughter is so
proud of the name Federman, that she will never, <b>never</b>, she says,
even if she were to be tortured, change that name, or assume another name.
She is all Federman.  That is why Federman loves his name and loves those
who carry that name.
