<b>CORRECTIONS</b> <p><br>


Because of a production error, an article about a concentration camp in
Bosnia omitted a passage in some copies.  The affected paragraph should
have read:<p>

<i>Mr. Popovic estimated that on the basis of individual and mass
executions he personally witnessed close to 3,000 Muslims from Vlasenica
(pronounced -- vlah-seh-NEET-sah) lost their lives at Susica after the
Bosnian war began in April 1992.</i><p>

The existence of the camps -- including Susica (pronounced --
sue-SEE-chah) -- has been known since August 1992, when, four months after
the war began, the Omarska and Kereterm camps near Prijedor and Banja Luka
were uncovered.<p>

  

A report in the Chronicle column on Wednesday about Elie Wiesel's visit to
Sighet, Romania, where he was born, referred incorrectly to the fate of
members of his family in Nazi concentration camps.  Mr. Wiesel's father
died in Buchenwald, not Auschwitz;  one sister, not three sisters, died in
Auschwitz along with Mr. Wiesel's mother.  The report also omitted to
mention one of the camps Mr. Wiesel survived.  He survived Buchenwald, as
well as Auschwitz.<p>

The report also misstated Sighet's population.  It is about 45,000, not
100,000.<p>

  
					      

Because of a transmission error, an article yesterday about foreign
efforts to help Rwandan refugees misspelled the surname of an American
military spokesman.  He is Colonel Robert Mirelson, not Nirelson.<p>
	  

Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Friday about
the bankruptcy case of R.H. Macy & Company misidentified the executive
vice president of Macy's in some editions.  He is Thomas C. Shull, not
Thomas C. Shaw.<p>

	  

An article on Saturday about the intense local newspaper coverage of Long
Island's East End misspelled the given name of an author who lives in Sag
Harbor.  He is Wilfrid Sheed.<p>

	  

Articles in Die Zeit and in Der Spiegel about author Raymond Federman,
whose latest novel, To Whom It May Concern, has just been translated into
German under the title Betrifft, consistently  spells his name
Federmann.<p>

  

When informed of the error concerning the misspelling of his name, Mister
Federman shrugged his shoulders and said:  <i>The Germans always do that
to my name.  It's not serious.  More serious, he added, is the error SS
Heinrichsohn made, on August 19, 1942, in the telex he addressed to
Oberf&uuml;hrer Eichmann and to the Commandant of Auschwitz, upon the
departure
of Convoy 21 from Paris (destination Auschwitz).  In that telex, which
listed the names and dates of birth of all the children (Convoy 21 left
with 373 children under the age of 16 -- 162 boys, 199 girls;  the sex of
12 children could not be determined according to SS Herinrichsohn's
telex), the date of birth of my sisters were incorrectly given.  The date
of birth for my sister Sarah was given as 21/10/25, whereas in fact she
was born 21/10/26;  the date of birth for my sister Jacqueline was given
as 30/9/28, whereas in fact she was born 30/8/29. </i><p>

When asked if he intended to have these administrative errors corrected,
Mister Federman replied: <i>Don't you think it's a bit late for that?
</i><p>
