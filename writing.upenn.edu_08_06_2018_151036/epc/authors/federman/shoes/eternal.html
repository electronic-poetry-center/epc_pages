<b>ETERNAL RETURN</b><p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>For Marianne Hauser</i><p>

As we old bums [you & me & your mom & the other bum in peeoria]
contemplate what appears to others to be <b>l'&acirc;ge</b> [<i>vieillesse
ou
vieilles fesses</i>] as we admire [with a touch of disdain] our own
amazing present mental agility [and virility too] as we delight in the
fact that we are becoming so good [so dexterous]  so much better with
words as we <b>get older</b> [perhaps even <b>wiser</b> in spite of the
clich&eacute;] as we listen [especially at night] to <b>those protracted
echoes
of the void</b> [excuse the terminal lyricism] but without asking [as in
days of youth] whence the <b>original sound</b> [I almost said <b>original
sin</b>) came [sometimes unwanted] as we contemplate the landscape of
words we designed and left behind us [not without pain] yes as we
contemplate  the not too distant moment when we will have to change tense
[inevitably so] we wonder [often aloud] how the hell have we managed to
come this far [to do that much] with words <b>[words words our whole life
was but a pell mell babel of words]</b> and look oh look how they fall in
place now so easily so quietly our words as they say [or fail to say] what
they want to say before crumbling into the <b>great void</b> [excuse the
romantic agony] alright crumbling into the motherfucking abyss of
forgetfulness <b>[le grand ab&icirc;me de l'oubli]</b><p>
