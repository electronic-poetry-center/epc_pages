<B>FOR THE SAKE OF OUR NAME</b><p> <br>

we make little signs <br>
we scratch obscure <br>
symbols <br>
on pieces of paper <br>
we draw little <br>
x-x-x-x's <br>
everywhere <br>
anywhere <br>
to gather back into us <br>
the departed <br>
to bring the absent <br>
the lost ones <br>
back <br>
into the design <br>
of our family name<P>

I am the end <br>
of the line <br>
the last <br>
federman <br>
but I continue <br>
to make believe <br>
that it is only <br>
the beginning <P>

those who listen <br>
in silence <br>
when I shout <br>
our name <br>
seem to certify <br>
by their silence <br>
that our name <br>
is still there<P><BR>

<B>Tell  them</B><P>

those traveling <br>
with you now <br>
far in-<br>
side <br>
the unforgivable <br>
how it was us <br>
[who are with you <br>
always]<br>
pushed you <br>
hard <br>
deeper in-<br>
to <br>
the deep <br>
where you found <br>
our most bitter <br>
dreams <br>
our sweetest <br>
dreams too <br>
and how later <br>
later <br>
back and forth <br>
back and forth <br>
in the hollow of our <br>
inextinguishable names <br>
together we learned <br>
to fly again <br>
to fly away <br>
again <br>
together <br>
in our name <br>
