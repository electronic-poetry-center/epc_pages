<b>THE COMPETITION</b><p><br>

Seven years old.  You are in school.  An all boy school -- <i> une
&eacute;cole
de gar&ccedil;ons. </i> Yes, a French school.  You were born in France.
It's
not your fault. You had no voice in this decision. During
<i>r&eacute;cr&eacute;ation
</i> the older boys -- eleven and twelve years old -- go to the far end of
the yard near the big wall to play.  You go with them even though they
always make fun of you because you are rickety and clumsy.  That too is
not your fault.  The older boys let you play with them because they like
to laugh at you.  In the far corner of the yard near the big wall, where
the <i> Pion </i> in charge of watching the boys during <i>
r&eacute;cr&eacute;ation
</i>  cannot see what's going on, the tallest boy draws a line on the
wall above his head with a piece of white chalk, then he draws another
line on the ground about <i> trois m&egrave;tres </i> from the wall.  Then
the
boys, half a dozen of them, besides you, start the competition to see who
can piss the highest above the line on the wall.  You never win.  Only
once did you succeed in pissing above the white line, but that's because
you stood close to the wall, about one meter away, and also because you
held back all the <i> pipi </i> you had in you since the night before in
anticipation of the competition.  You were excited to have managed for the
first time to piss above the line, to piss into the sky, even though you
did not win the competition that day. The other boys said you cheated
because you crossed the line on the ground.  Only those who piss on the
wall from behind the line on the ground are qualified.  Those who cross
the line are disqualified.  That day you were disqualified as a high
altitude <i> pisseur. </i>
