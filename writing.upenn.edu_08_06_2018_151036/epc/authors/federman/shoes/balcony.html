<b>HERE ON THE BALCONY</b> <p> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <i>[From Berlin]</i><p><br>

He stands on the balcony <br>
in a far away place,<br>
raises his arm before him <br>
in a rigid salute <br>
to an absent crowd.<p>

We are historical, he thinks,<br>
but we don't live in history.<br>
Yes, there are records of this,<br>
but we are not in the records.<br>
Ah such complexity!<p>

He thinks this is the defining act,<br>
the actualization of a central image:<br>
that of a man standing <br>
on the edge of an abyss <br>
pissing into a hard wind.<br>
Not a mistake, not an idle gesture,<br>
but the assertion of presence.<p>

There is unceasing arbitration <br>
at work here, he senses that,<br>
for he is always going out,<br>
always being more <br>
than his circumstance,<br>
more than the sum.<p>

He knows it is <br>
absolutely correct <br>
to be here.<br>
In fact, it is a necessary act.<p>

It seems that when others <br>
return to the scene of the crime <br>
they are there essentially <br>
to lament their losses,<br>
then the criminal is the victor.<p>

But what is the alternative?<br>
To cower in one's righteous place,<br>
in one's corner of self-pity?<br>
A freeing instance here <br>
shouts:  I am alive!<p>

By character and intuition,<br>
by inclination too,<br>
he always goes towards,<br>
not from and not away,<br>
always goes towards it.<p>

Here in this he has no choice.<br>
He knows that as in the old fable,<br>
the hero must confront a series <br>
of fearsome obstacles,<br>
the last and greatest of which <br>
is coming home. <p>
