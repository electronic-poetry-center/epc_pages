<b>THE VOICE</b> <p><br>


The creation of the universe is a mystery naturally fitted to excite the
liveliest interest of man -- the inhabitant of the universe.  Two homeless
bums, sleeping on the ground under a bridge, but nonetheless members of
the human race (as far as can be determined), are also intrigued by this
mystery, and even more so by the problem of how man (and, of course, woman
too, but that's a problem they deal with separately) was created.<p>

They are, of course, familiar (who is not?), in spite of their state of
destitution, with all the theories (scientific and pseudoscientific) which
theorize about the chaos that preceded the creation of the universe, about
the Big Bang thing, about the divine intervention gimmick, and so
forth.<p>

However, as the two bums sit on a bench in a park (yes, they have moved
out from under the bridge where they spent the night, and are now trying
to warm themselves under the bright afternoon sun) next to an old oak tree
which rises majestically into the sky, an oak tree inhabited by birds,
bees, and other lovely creatures of the universe, they are discussing
today how the human race somehow managed to perpetuate itself.<p>

Bum One explains it this way to Bum Two, for it is Bum One's turn that day
to speculate:  Supposedly the first man on earth, and the first woman too,
I mean the very first man and woman (I'll not go today into the question
of how the man got there and how he acquired a female companion) managed
to progenitate themselves with stones.<p>

To progenitate?  With stones?  Bum Two, seems puzzled.<p>

Let me explain.  The man went with his woman -- I have forgotten their
names, but let's call them for the sake of the story A & B ...<p>

Why not A & E?  Interrupted Bum Two.<p>

Okay, A & E, if you prefer.  I don't care.  Or X & Y.  Doesn't matter.
Their names are of little consequence in this story.  What counts is how
they ensured the continuity of the species.<p>

Alright, go on. <p>

Well, this is how the story goes.  They climbed to the top of a mountain
... Oh, I forgot to mention that on that day there was an incredible flood
on earth and everything was under water, except for the high peaks of the
mountain ... and that's why they climbed to the top of the mountain.<p>

Was it the Deluge?  Inquired Bum Two.<p>

I don't know if it was <b>THE</b> Deluge, but let me tell you it was
pouring cats & dogs, yes a real deluge.  Unbelievable the amount of rain
that came down from the sky that day.<p>

Must have been something to watch.<p>

Yes, I suppose.  But let me go on.  When the man and the woman reached the
top of the mountain they heard a voice.
<p>

Whose voice?  A human voice?  A divine voice?  The voice of Jupiter, of
God?
And which God?  Or just a plain voice out of nowhere?<p>
		
How do I know, and what does it matter?  Let's call it <b>A</b> voice, a
disembodied voice, and leave it at that.
<p>
				
Fine.  A voice.<p>

And that voice realizing that the man and the woman were the only two
survivors of the flood told them that when the deluge would stop they
would have to renew the human race.<p>

Hey, wait a minute.  You said before that the man and the woman were the
first ones on earth, and now you say that they were the only survivors of
the flood because all the others had drowned, then they were not the first
ones, they were the last ones.<p>

Sometimes you really get on my nerves you know with your screwed up logic.
First ones, last ones, what's the difference, they were the <b>only
ones.</b><p>

Okay.  I'll go for that.  So, according to you, the voice told them that
they would have to renew the human race, but did it explain how?  Didn't
the voice tell the man to fuck the woman and that would solve the
problem?<p>

You know, you really have a filthy mind.  Not everything in the universe
is resolved with sex.<p>

Maybe not for you, my dear old fart, but for me it remains the most viable
and most potent means of solving most problems, especially the problem of
ensuring the continuity of the human race.<p>

Well, that's another story.  Mine is different.  So listen, and please
stop interrupting.<p>

Alright, alright, go ahead, finish your dumb story.<p>

The voice said to A & B ...<p>

A & E!<p>

Okay, A & E, that soon the flood water will recede and they will be able
to come down from the mountain.  Everything down there will be barren,
full of corpses.  Each of you must find the corpse of your mother, and
then you must take her bones, cover your faces with a cloth, and walk
slowly on the earth toward the sea casting behind you the bones of your
mothers.<p>

You're kidding.  That's what the voice said?  The bones of their mothers.
How strange.  But let me ask you something.  Why the veil over their
faces?<p>

I don't know.  That's what the voice said.  I do not question voices.  Oh,
also, I almost forgot, the voice said to A & E that they will have to
undress completely before throwing the bones away.  Yes, the voice
explained that the act of casting the bones of one's mother should always
be performed naked.<p>

That makes sense to me.  But what doesn't make sense is how the casting of
the bones would renew the race.<p>
		Be quiet.  That is the great mystery of the voice.  So I
cannot tell you how the casting of the bones would renew the race.  What I
can tell you is that, at first, the man and the woman were disturbed by
this, and they objected.  They said they could not obey such a command
because they felt that it would desecrate their mother's bones to throw
them away.<p>

What did the voice say?<p>

It said that it was the only way.  Otherwise it would be the end of the
human race.<p>

Wow, that would have been terrible, and you and I would not be here, and
you could not be telling me this story.	<p>			
Stop kidding around.  This is serious.  Anyway, after a long moment of
reflection the man asked (only the man spoke, the 
woman remained silent at his side) if instead of bones they could throw
stones.<p>

Stones?<p>

Yes, stones.  This is how the man put it to the voice, for as I said he
was the spokesman for the two of them, and quite eloquent, yes, quite a
beau parleur:<p>

<b>Dear Voice, either my sagacity deceives me, or the command is one we
may obey without impiety.  But the earth is the great parent of us all.
Our mother.  And stones are her bones.  Why can't we cast the earth's
stones behind us instead of our mother's bones?</b><p>
		Hey, that guy was smart for a caveman.<p>

Who said he was a caveman.  There you go again, always distorting
everything I say.  Anyway, the voice was silent for a long time, and then
it said in a thunderous, angry tone:<p>

<b>
You humans are hopeless.  I give you the possibility of renewing
yourselves with a most simple little trick, and you have to complicate the
problem.  I am fed up with you.  You can go fuck yourselves and leave me
alone.  I shall speak to you no more.</b><p>

This was the end of Bum One's story.  That's all he knew.  That's all he
told.<p>

Bum Two reflected upon what the voice said to the man and the woman.
Could it be that the voice did not realize the implication of what it had
said, and inadvertently had given to the man and woman the solution to
their existential dilemma?<p>
