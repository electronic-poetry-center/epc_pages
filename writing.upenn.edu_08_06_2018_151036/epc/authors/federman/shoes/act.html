<b>ACT WITHOUT WORDS FOR THE HAND</b> <p><br>

<b>[A Play For Television]</b> <p>

 

He did the mouth.  I will do the hand. <br>
Only the hand.<p>

A play.  A mime.  A mime for television.<p>

Act Without Words For The Hand. <p>

Opening shot:  close-up of Hand on the screen <br>
[male or female,  left or right hand, irrelevant].  <p>

Hand in bright light appears cut at the wrist.   Rest of  screen black.<p>

Hand performs a series of  gestures indicating  various human activities.
[The sequence of gestures may shape a story, if producer of play so
desires.  A plot can be written for the hand].<p>

Light dims or brightens depending on the public or private nature of the
action being performed by Hand.<p>

Opening shot:  As light brightens Hand appears gradually, clenched in a
tight fist seen from above.  [Thumb, tucked under the fingers, cannot be
seen]. <br>
Hand opens slowly and spreads fingers.  Palm of hand towards viewers.<p>

Hand begins to perform the gestures.  [Other gestures can be improvised by
Hand as play progresses, if producer so desires].<p><br><br>
 

<b>The Gestures</b><p>


<b>1.</b>	Thumb and index finger snap sharply 	together
as if to summon someone.<p>

<b>

together.<p>

<b>

                              <b>
	4.</b>	Hand caresses [or slaps] invisible body [<i>light dims or
brightens depending on which gesture is performed -- the caress or the
slap</i>].<p>
<b>

thumb.<p>

<b>
	8.</b>	Palm of Hand fully open faces invisible object to stop its
progress.<p>

<b>

reuniting several times in quick happy motions.<p>
<b>
	10.</b>	Erect index finger suggests to someone to 	go ...
himself or herself.<p><br><br>
 







<b>Audience Participation During Performance 
The Hand</b><p>

Audience suggests other possible gestures [pious or obscene] for the hand
to perform.<p>

Audience debates if a second hand [or several other hands] should come
into play.  For instance, as in classical tragedies, for the sake of
symmetry:<p>

<center>
<b>
Act 2 -- 2 hands<br>
Act 3 -- 3 hands<br>
Act 4 -- 4 hands<br>
Act 5 -- 5 hands<p>
</b>
</center>

Audience could also vote to decide if, in the final act, all the hands
should strangle one another, as in a Greek tragedy, or if the hands should
gather together shake hands and dance together, as in a modern play of the
theater of the absurd.<p><br><br>
 


<b>Examples of Gestures Television 
Audience Could Suggest</b><p>
	
<b>1.</b>	Fingers perform act of walking or running.<p>

<b>
	2.</b>	Hand takes shape of  a spider or an elephant.<p>

<b>
3. </b>	Hand pretends to play the piano or the guitar.<p>

<b>4.</b> 	Fingers rub palm of Hand self-reflexively.<p>

<b>
	5.</b>	Hand makes a circle with two fingers suggesting a hole or
zero.<p>
<b>
	6.</b>	Index finger overlaps forefinger to indicate a close
relationship.<p>
<b>
	7.</b>	First two fingers form a V for Victory -- or for the Roman
numeral five or Peace.<p>

<b>
8.</b>	Three fingers indicate number three.<p>
<b>
9.</b>	Hand counts its fingers.<p>
<b>
10.</b>	Hand makes a fist and punches invisible face.<p>

	
[Other plots are possible]<p><br><br>
 


<b>The Performance</b><p>

Duration of the performance: 30  minutes.  [Time of duration for each
gesture may vary, depending on the plot].<p>

When performed on commercial television <b>THE HAND</b> should be listed
as a 30 minute play -- 20 minutes for the performance itself, the extra 10
minutes for the commercials.<p>

Note:  Whatever product or service is being advertised -- in all
commercials <b>a hand</b> must appear to give unity to the 30 minute
program.<p>

The play could also become a <b>CD ROM</b>.  The computer viewers could
control the gestures of The Hand or even invent new gestures for The Hand
to perform.  The Hand could even write its own script.<p>

  <b>The End </b>  <p>
