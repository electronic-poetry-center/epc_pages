<b>NOTES ON 
MON TOUR-MENTEUR 
[MY TOR-MENTOR]</b><p><br>


The title of this fragment of writing offers four possible readings.
There may be others.<p>

<b>Mon Tour</b> -- my turn.  My turn to begin.  My turn to tell the truth,
or the lie [same thing].  My turn to tell how it is.  How it was with the
two of us -- moi et mon tourmenteur [me and my tormentor], in two
languages.<p>

<b>Menteur</b> -- liar.  My turn then to lie.  Or to tell the truth about
<b>Mon Tourmenteur.</b><p>

<b>Tourmenteur</b> -- the one who inflicts suffering on the other.  [Celui
qui fait du mal &agrave; l'autre].<p>

<b>My Tor</b> -- seemingly a meaningless syllable.  But this is a
bilingual fragment of writing.  Perhaps other languages are hidden here.
<b>Tor?</b>  Yes, of course, the door -- <b>Das Tor.</b>  To tell the
truth or to lie through the door.  From behind the door.  To shout the
truth or the lie from the hole behind <b>Das Tor</b> [the German hole, the
German door].<p>

<b>Mentor</b> -- the master, the teacher, the guide, the one who is above,
the one who inspires.  The other in this fragment of writing. <b>Lui
[him].</b><p>
