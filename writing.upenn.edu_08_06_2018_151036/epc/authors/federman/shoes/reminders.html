<b>REMINDERS -- TO A WRITER FRIEND</b><p><br>

Have I ever told you how the scribbled lines you sent my way almost daily
make me want to go on living? <p>

Have I ever told you of your generosity when you answer for me the dumb
questions I keep asking myself?<p>

Have I ever told you how I appreciate the effort you make in assuring  me
that I am breathing?<p>

Have I ever told you how appeasing the light of your language is to me?<p>

Have I ever told you how the smile of your language makes me smile?<p>

Have I ever told you how liberating  your writing is as it wipes out all
possible refutations?<p>

Have I ever told you how your disembodied voice is for me an instrument of
interior music?<p>

Have I ever told how your modest attention to the details of my futile
activities is important to me?<p>

Have I ever told you how your quiet and resigned courage encourages me?<p>

Have I ever told you how your weaknesses strengthen me?<p>

Have I ever told you how your tender attention to my follies delights
me?<p>

Have I ever told you how the delicacy of your need for me makes me want
more?

Have I ever told you how your comments on what I do make me want to do
more?<p>

Have I ever told you how your reading of what I plan to write forces me to
write what would otherwise remain unwritten?<p>

Have I ever told you how foolish I feel that you are always willing to
listen to the unimportant things I have to say?<p>

Have I ever told you how necessary it is for me that you are there?<p>

Have I ever told you that even when you don't speak I hear you?<p>
