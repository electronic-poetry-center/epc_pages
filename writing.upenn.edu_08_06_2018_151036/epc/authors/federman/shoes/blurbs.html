<b>BLURBS for LOOSE SHOES</b><p><br>

<b>Larry McCaffery</b><p>

Raymond Federman has already produced a major  body of mind-and-genre
expanding books.  His latest
work, LOOSE SHOES--his first story collection--is a poignant,
fun-filled collection of
unclassifiable "micro-fictions" that pack a macro-wallop of readerly
enjoyment.  Here Federman continues
his obsessive exploration of life, death, sex, and memory from the
perspective of someone reflecting back
in the twilight of his existence fully aware that he's already been there,
done that but who insists that it's
the recounting of life's adventures and misadventures that matters.
Certainly as far as THIS recounting is
concerned, he's right.<p>

Ray Federman's loose shoes are uncomfortable. They irritate the skins of
genre and discourse. Federman's shoes create blisters on the souls (sic)
of
readers who want to remain comfortably numb and read in the same as it
ever
was patterns. These texts are short, confusing, bastards. Where they came
from, I'll never know. (Although it has been suggested in police briefs
that
Federman photocopies the tongues of others while claiming [through
indeterminate speech] to be an author.) All of Federman's writing stares
down
into the abyss and mutters: are you my daddy? Curses. Dictations. Oh, and
Federman, does so with exuberance. The kind of exuberance (dare I say,
jouissance? Yes, I dare. Actually I am not saying, I am echoing, but I
digress) ... Let me begin again, The kind of exuberance that only a
Frenchman
wandering the streets of Detroit experiences.<p>
