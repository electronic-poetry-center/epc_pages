<b>REFLECTIONS CONCERNING
ETHNIC AUTHENTICITY</b><p><br>


Like Aaron Finkelkraut who, for personal reasons, changed his name to
Alain Fine during a difficult critical period for his family, himself, and
his landsmen, I too have been wondering what my true ethnic authenticity
is, even though I have preserved my much too revealing name. <p>

It does not matter whether or not you know who Aaron Finkelkraut is, his
name tells you what he is, even more so than my own.  A passionate
left-wing radical in his youth, Finkelkraut one day, in his later years
[let's say middle-age so we can have a point of reference in his life]
looked at himself and laughed as he recognized how falsely idealistic, how
naive, how sentimental, how romantic he had been during his revolutionary
days, as he used to call that period of his life when he practiced with
fervor and devotion what was then known as Self-Lobotomism.<p>

It is that day, that day of derisive self-recognition, after he stopped
laughing, and then burst into tears, that Finkelkraut wondered if he was
an authentic or an inauthentic Jew, suddenly remembering the distinction
Jean-Paul Sartre once made, a his little [not so kosher] book entitled
<i><b>La Question Juive,</b></i> between authenticity and inauthenticity,
a book which Finkelkraut, when he was younger and easily seduced by
intellectual flamboyance, read with great interest and admiration, as he
then considered himself a faithful Existentialist, before he converted to
Self-Lobotomism.<p>

Like Finkelkraut, I was saying, I too have been wondering lately if I am
an authentic or inauthentic Jew.  And like Finkelkraut, whom I have never
met, but with whom I feel a strong brotherly osmosis, if I may permit
myself the misuse of this term, I too reached the conclusion that I am
merely an imaginary Jew.<p>

Like Finkelkraut, I often feel the lack of authentic Jewishness in me, I
feel it like an absence, and I regret that my parents, who I assume were
authentic Jews [authentic Jews know Yiddish, and my parents often spoke
that language that seemed so mysterious to me.  Yes, my parents had that
linguistic knowledge, among all the other knowledge Jews carry with them
in their wandering], I often regret that my parents did not pass on to me
[biologically and intellectually] this authenticity.
<p>
However, I do not feel inauthentic either since I have no fear of
proclaiming my Jewishness, no fear of making my presence felt as a Jew
wherever I go.  It is in this sense that I share with Finkelkraut the
notion that the two of us are neither authentic nor inauthentic Jews, but
imaginary Jews.<p>

Still, the question remains, a question wrapped in anguish, bitterness,
frustration, humiliation:  Can a Jew really be an imaginary Jew?  Can one
spend one's entire existence in an imaginary condition, in the no man's
land of un-knowledge, without ever knowing true authenticity or true
inauthenticity?<p>

Of course, I am not ready to plunge into Talmudic Studies [as many
disillusioned left-wing radical Jews have done when they confronted their
Jewish inauthenticity in the mirror of their guilt], to provide an answer
to that question.  Nor am I ready to lie on the couch of some over-payed
shrink in disgrace in order to let him hear, let him see the lack, the
emptiness, the hole inside of me.<p>

Perhaps the only solution to that question is to formulate not an answer,
but another question that will cancel the original question.  The new
question is:  Can an imaginary Jew ever become an authentic Jew?<p>

I don't know how Aaron Finkelkraut would answer that question, but in my
case it can only be answered with yet another question: How can one make a
distinction between what one is, and what one imagines one is?<p>
