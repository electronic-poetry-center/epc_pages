<b>A HOPELESS STORY</b> <p><br>


I shall begin by summarizing what happened before this story started.
Nothing happened before.  It was a wild and stormy night on the West
Coast.  This, however, is immaterial to the present story since the
opening scene is not set on the West Coast.  The weather was just as bad
on the East Coast.  But the opening scene of this story is set in the
middle of the country far from both coasts, and no weather report has been
furnished by the weather man for this part of the country.  The scene
takes place near  a town called Knox Towers (pronounced as if written
Noshtaws) the capital of Knox County (pronounced as if written Noshcunty).
But when reading this story it is not necessary to pronounce these names.
Nor the names of the characters.  Especially since the characters will
remain unnamed.  On s'en fout des caract&egrave;res. Part of the story is
written in French  but readers not familiar with French can skip those
passages.
The first person narrator will be known only as <b>I</b>, and the other
protagonist, the one who will be killed eventually, as <b>he</b>.  There
are no female characters in this story.  If a female character were to
appear in the story she would be referred to as <b>she</b>.  By the time
<b>I</b> confronts <b>he</b> and kills him, the weather on the west coast
will have changed radically.  But this in no way will affect the plot
since by the end of the story it becomes obvious that the plot has fallen
apart.  The story ends with a question mark.
