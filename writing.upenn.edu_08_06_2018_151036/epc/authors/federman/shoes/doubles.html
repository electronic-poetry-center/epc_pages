<b>THE INVISIBLE DOUBLES</b><p><br>


Every human being -- or for that matter -- every living creature on this
planet has an invisible double -- that double can either be benevolent or
malevolent -- but the visible creature does not know  if his or her or its
invisible double is benevolent or malevolent -- the visible creatures of
this planet -- as history has shown -- are either benevolent or malevolent
-- though it has been recorded in history books that on rare occasions  --
a malevolent creature can suddenly become benevolent -- a case in point
herr schindler -- and a benevolent creature can without any visible reason
become malevolent -- for instance the case of a pet dog that suddenly
bites the hand of his kind mistress while she is feeding him -- visible
creatures have no way of knowing whether or not their ID is benevolent or
malevolent -- but one day in the future a scientist invents a gizmo that
reveals if an ID is benevolent or malevolent -- now the real story begins
-- an organization known only as O is formed -- under the leadership of
the scientist -- known only as S -- who is a malevolent creature -- this O
that controls the gizmo sets out to exterminate all the benevolent IDs so
that it can used all the malevolent IDs to enslave all the visible
creatures -- benevolent as well as malevolent -- but of course two visible
human creatures -- known only as P6 & R9 -- have discovered what the O is
doing and are trying to save the visible creatures of the planet from
being enslaved -- P6 & R9 set out to destroy one by one the members of the
O who have the gizmos that destroy the benevolent IDs -- the problem -- or
rather one should say the crisis -- is that the O has discovered what P6 &
R9 are doing and is pursuing them  to destroy them before they destroy all
the destroyers of IDs -- the great moment of suspense of this story -- the
climax one should say -- in the 
fullest sense of the word -- comes when only one member of the O is left
with the last gizmo -- of course it's the malevolent S -- and P6 & R9 --
who have fallen in love with one another in the course of their adventure
-- that's the sub-plot -- are closing in on him -- but S is aware that
they are coming for him -- and now comes the denouement -- however the
outcome of the confrontation between S and P6 & R9 will not be  revealed
at this point so that the reader of this story can invent it -- <p>

should this fabulous story be made into a movie the author will insist on
writing the script himself -- and on choosing the director and actors.<p>
