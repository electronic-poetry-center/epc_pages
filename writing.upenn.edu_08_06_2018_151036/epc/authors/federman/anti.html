<B>NUMBERS</b>


it is very important to remember [1]
as Jasper Johns so well demonstrated with his numbers [2]
that numbers can only refer to themselves [3]
numbers alone have no story [4]
no story to  tell [5]
only when they are added subtracted
multiplied divided do numbers tell a story [6]
then they have a plot [7]
they mean something [8]
they mean having more or less of whatever one has [9]
more or less of whatever the numbers now refer to [8] 
but numbers standing alone refer only to themselves [7]
that is why the number 9 is so perfect [6]
it cancels all the other numbers when they are added
subtracted multiplied  divided one with the other and  the result is 9 [5]

0 is okay too [4]
but his particular visual quality makes certain people confuse it
with the letter 0 or with the symbol of a hole [3]
this is not so with  the other numbers [2]
their visual quality brings nothing to the mind [1] 
concretely or abstractly [2]
numbers standing alone cannot become symbols [3]
they cannot mean [4]
they are nothing [5]
they mean nothing [6] 
they are nothing but scratches on the paper [7]
but numbers when added subtracted multiplied
divided become dangerous because they mark
the difference between those who have much
& those who have little [8]
between wealth and poverty [9]
between all or nothing [0]

<b>RADIO TALK   [a true poem]</b>

An interviewer
on a radio talk show
asks an artist
to tell him if
the numbers of hours
he spends painting
in a year corresponds
to the amount of money
he makes in that year

The artist mumbles
something about how
art and money
are not compatible
and leaves it at that

I wanted to butt in
and tell that asshole
interviewer that
he was confusing
A job with Work

A job is where one
goes to make money
Work (especially
Work well done) is
what gives pleasure
and nothing else

A job is boring
A job is tedious
A job is embarrasing
A job is exploitative
A job is humiliating
A job is idiotic
A job is a waste of time

But Work well done
always gives pleasure
and satisfaction

A job is what you do
five days a week
for a determined
amount of time
usually prescribed
by your boss
and your needs
A job is limiting

Work takes place
all the time
even when you sleep
Work is indefinite

<b>ANATOMY OF THE POET'S SKULL</b>

Unenhanced and enhanced CT scans of the skull obtained:
ventricles and sucli age appropriate
no midline shift no focal gray or white matter abnormality
nor bleed noted 2x1 cm. slightly enhancing soft
tissue plaque abutting the internal auditory canal
on the right laterally and slightly indenting
upon the right cerebellar peduncle.

Enhanced axial and coral CT scans of the orbits obtained:
Globes optic nerves optic chiasm and extra ocular muscles
symmetrically normal no abnormal intrachonal
or extrachonal inflammatory or neoplastic changes
bony orbits intact but pronounced leftward nasoseptal deviation
concha bullosa of the right middle turbinate
and low grade inflammatory mucoperiosteal
thickening of the right maxillary antrum.

Minimally enhancing and en plaque soft tissue mass
in right cerebellar pontine angle with differential
diagnosis of meningioma acoustic neuroma and epidermoid.
 
Detailed evaluation of posterior fossa with gadolinium is suggested.

Otherwise all is well with the poet's skull.
