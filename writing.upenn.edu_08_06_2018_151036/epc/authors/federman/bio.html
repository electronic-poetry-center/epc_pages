<b>	RESUME</b>
<p>
Born in France (1928), I am a bilingual writer.  I emigrated to the U.S. in
1947.  After serving in the U.S. Army in Korea and Japan (1951-54), I 
 studied
at Columbia University under the G.I. Bill (B.A., Summa Cum Laude, Phi Beta
Kappa, 1957);  graduate studies at U.C.L.A. (M.A., 1958, Ph.D. in French
Literature, 1963 -- Doctoral Dissertation on Samuel Beckett).  1959 to 
 1964,
I taught at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and since 1964 
 at
The State University of New York at Buffalo, in the French Department until
1973, and as of 1973 as a fiction writer, critic, and scholar in the 
 English
Department and Comparative Literature Program.  I was a Visiting Professor 
 at
the University of Montreal (1970-71), at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem
(1982-83), and at University of California at San Diego (Spring 1986).  In
1990, I was promoted to the rank of Suny Distinguished Professor, and in
1994, I was appointed to the Melodia E. Jones Chair of Literature.

Though I have published four volumes of poems:  Among the Beasts (1967),  
 Me
Too (1975),  Duel/Duel (1991),  Now Then (1992), several books of 
 criticism,
and numerous essays and articles, I consider myself primarily a fiction
writer.

1971, winner of the Frances Steloff Fiction Prize and The Panache

American Book Award),  To Whom It May Concern (The Fiction Collective Two,
1990);  La Fourrure de ma Tante Rachel (written in French, Editions Circ E9 
,
Paris, 1996).  My novels have been translated into German, Italian, French,
Hungarian, Polish, Serbian, Rumanian, Hebrew, Dutch, Greek, Japanese, and
Chinese.

Hebrew University in Jerusalem;  I was awarded a National Endowment for the
Arts Fellowship in fiction in 1985, and a New York State Foundation for the
Arts  Fellowship for fiction in 1986;  in 1989-1990, I was invited by DAAD
(The Berlin Artist Program) to spend a year in Berlin as 
 Writer-in-Residence.
 During that year, DAAD published in a bilingual edition a collection of
experimental poetry and prose entitled Playtexts/Spieltexte, and The 
 Stopover
Press in Berlin published Duel/Duel, a trilingual volume of recent poems.  
 In
