WISLAWA SZYMBORSKA
<br>
<p>
So the boys are now in Krakow trying desperately to find the reclusive
poetess Wislawa Szymborska to ring her up and announce to her that two of her
greatest fans have shuffled all the way from Bumsville, as it were, and wish
to chat with her, to take her to lunch and a ride on the ferry (if there is
one in Krakow).
<p>
The rattlesnake approves of himself without reservations, is the bums'
favorite line, a line we find them chanting aloud over and over again at the
Cafe Milo  z Szcze liwa while eating boiled potatoes and drinking vodka, and
where the other patrons look at them as their own future, as what they will
become when they too are rich American fuddy-duds, as their beloved homeland
becomes yet another anonymous market economy.
<p>
What, inquires Boy 1 of Boy 2, does the rattle-snake approve?  Then they both
chant the answer to the question, which we now invite you also, dear reader,
to sing along with them:   The rattlesnake approves of himself without any
reservations.
<p>
Where is this literary effort going, where is Wislawa Szymborska?  Why
doesn't she answer her telephone?  Where are you Wislawa, dear?  Why won't
you reveal yourself and come dine with the old rattlers, whose tails knock so
hollowly in such unreserved approval.
<p>
What to do, where to go, how to proceed, what surface other than the poem to
inhabit.  The boys order more boiled potatoes and another round of vodka
(yes, beloved reader, yes indeed) and start chanting another Wislawa line:
We see here an instance of bad proportions, we see here an instance of bad
proportions.
<p>
