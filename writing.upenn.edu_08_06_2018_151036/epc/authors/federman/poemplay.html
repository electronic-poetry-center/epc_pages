<b>WHO WILL CRACK FIRST</b><br>
<br>
[a conceptual play in the form of a poem]<br>
<br>
<br>
the situation<br>
<br>
two friends have decided never<br>
to speak to each other again<br>
<br>
they feel that the affection<br>
and respect they have for each other<br>
is gradually dwindling away with each word <br>
that passes between them<br>
<br>
the situation is dramatic<br>
a play for two actors<br>
and two loudspeakers<br>
<br>
the voices on loudspeakers<br>
are the voices of the two actors<br>
<br>
stage dark at first<br>
gradual light reveals<br>
the two friends seated<br>
facing each other<br>
one left one right of stage<br>
<br>
loudspeaker over the head<br>
of each friend<br>
<br>
loudspeaker left tells why<br>
friend left will not crack first<br>
<br>
loudspeaker right tells why<br>
he thinks<br>
friend right will not crack<br>
first<br>
<br>
and so on<br>
<br>
while loudspeakers speak<br>
seated friends react<br>
with bodily and facial gestures<br>
to what loudspeaker <br>
above each head says<br>
<br>
voices on loudspeakers<br>
get louder more argumentative<br>
more aggressive angry enraged<br>
as the play progresses<br>
<br>
argument  turns to a debate<br>
a trial a competition<br>
voices encourage friends<br>
to remain firm in their silence<br>
<br>
loudspeaker left<br>
tells that the reason<br>
friend left will not crack<br>
is because he is a poet<br>
and poets know <br>
silence and solitude <br>
<br>
loudspeaker right retorts<br>
that friend right is an actor<br>
and actors know how not<br>
to crack during a play<br>
<br>
loudspeaker L<br>
tells that friend L<br>
will not crack first<br>
because once upon a time<br>
during the great war<br>
he was tortured<br>
he was tortured because<br>
he knew something<br>
something very secret<br>
something unspeakable<br>
the enemy tortured him<br>
but he did not talk<br>
he refused to talk<br>
<br>
for weeks and for weeks <br>
he remained silent in torture<br>
and silence became for him<br>
the reverse of torture<br>
that is why friend R will not crack first<br>
<br>
loudspeaker R<br>
counters by saying<br>
that anyone <br>
in friend L's situation<br>
would have found<br>
the courage not <br>
to crack it's natural<br>
it's easy its normal<br>
when one is being<br>
tortured it's the rule<br>
<br>
friend R found much more<br>
courage for something <br>
much more traumatic<br>
and he was only seven then<br>
the day his father beat him<br>
with his belt<br>
slashing at his body<br>
with the leather of the belt<br>
and even the belt buckle<br>
and that day friend R swore<br>
to himself in his pain<br>
that he would not talk<br>
to his father for a whole month<br>
and for a whole month friend R<br>
never spoke a word to his father<br>
only a few can find<br>
that  kind of courage <br>
the happy few <br>
and he was only seven then<br>
<br>
and so on and so on<br>
<br>
as the play progresses it becomes<br>
gradually evident that the two silent<br>
friends are growing more and more tense <br>
nervous tortured in their bodies and minds<br>
<br>
suddenly <br>
as the loudspeakers <br>
continue to argue<br>
the two friends <br>
let out a scream <br>
at the same time <br>
together<br>
<br>
say something please <br>
say something <br>
I can't take it anymore<br>
<br>
say something please <br>
say something <br>
I can' take it any more <br>
<br>
the screams get louder <br>
as stage goes dark<br>
<br>
no applause<br>
no curtain call<br>
<br>
<br>
