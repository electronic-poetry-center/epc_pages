      <p><b><i>The Poethical Wager</i>. By Joan Retallack<br>
        </b>Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. xii + 279 pp.</p>
      <p><br>
        The purpose of Joan Retallack's <i>The Poethical Wager</i> is to develop 
        an aesthetics of complexity, where complexity (as in chaos theory) has 
        to do with the singularity and irreducibility of things and events in 
        contrast to their subsumption into categories, hierarchies, systems, or 
        any of the forms of conceptual determination that we use to make sense 
        of our experience. And so her first recourse is to a pun: <i>poethics</i>, 
        which means something like leaving things to chance but nevertheless taking 
        responsibility for what happens. Poethics is a multifunctional term that 
        has application in art, science, and politics, as well as in everyday 
        life, where the economic necessity of reducing our actions and experiences 
        to schedules, rules, offices, and programs forecloses possibilities that, 
        opened up to experiment, just might satisfy our basic desire for the good 
        life. So poethics entails a poor ethics of responsibility to and for the 
        other as opposed to the traditionally forceful ethics of universal rules 
        and the <i>sittlichkeit</i> of integrated communities.<br>
        <br>
        <i>The Poethical Wager</i> is a book of twelve essays plus a substantial introduction 
        (&quot;Essay as Wager&quot;) on the essay as a form of conceptual art, 
        which is what each of these twelve essays turns into as it constructs 
        itself. In her second piece, &quot;Wager as Essay,&quot; Retallack says: 
        &quot;Essays, like poems and philosophical meditations, should elude our 
        grasp just because their business is to approach the liminal spectrum 
        of near-unintelligibility-immediate experience complicating what we thought 
        we knew. In this case, 'to write' means to engage in a probative, speculative 
        projection of the often surprising vectors of words as they graze the 
        circumstances of ongoing life&quot; (p. 48). &quot;Unintelligibility&quot; 
        is the keyword here and throughout <i>The Poethical Wager</i>. It is not a negative 
        concept but a concept of freedom. Intelligibility by contrast presupposes 
        confinement to reproductive systems whose progeny either mirror one another 
        or are cast aside if they don't. Retallack wants a theory of what does 
        not fit. &quot;Wager as Essay,&quot; for example, sketches very quickly 
        a brief history of the essay as an anarchic form of writing-Montaigne's 
        essays, for example, which, as Retallack says, are more like puzzles than 
        discourses. The later Wittgenstein's &quot;remarks,&quot; thoughts that 
        cannot be integrated into &quot;a natural order&#133;without breaks,&quot; 
        are likewise among her models, as are Adorno's Versuche-not just Prisms, 
        but even the forbidding Aesthetic Theory, which is not a systematic treatise 
        but a book of large fragments that articulates in uncompromising terms 
        the basic thesis of modernist aesthetics: &quot;The task of aesthetics 
        is not to comprehend artworks as hermeneutical objects; in the contemporary 
        situation, it is their incomprehensibility [Unbegreiflichkeit: literally, 
        ungraspability] that needs to be comprehended.&quot; Arguably all of Retallack's 
        work-her critical writings, her conversations with John Cage, and above 
        all her several volumes of innovative poetry-is an exploration and extension 
        of this thesis. <br>
        <br>
        Like Wittgenstein's <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> and Adorno's <i>Aesthetic 
        Theory,</i> Retallack's experimental essays are a calculated affront to 
        the academic paper and the institutions that mass-produce it, gripping 
        literary study in what Charles Bernstein calls &quot;frame lock.&quot; 
        To break the frame Retallack turns to the essays of Gertrude Stein, John 
        Cage, and her contemporaries Leslie Scalapino and Rosemary Waldrop-as 
        well as herself. Retallack's first chapter, &quot;<i>The Poethical Wager</i>,&quot; 
        is a self-interview on thickening poetics with an h. &quot;Poetics without 
        an h has primarily to do with questions of style. Style is the manner 
        in which your experience has understood, assimilated, imprinted you&quot; 
        (p. 38). By contrast, &quot;your poethical work begins when you no longer 
        wish to shape materials (words, visual elements, sounds) into legitimate 
        progeny of your own poetics. When you are released from filling in the 
        delimiting forms&#133;. If you persist, patterns in your work may become 
        more flexible, permeable, conversational, exploratory&quot; (p. 38). To 
        which Retallack might have added: more complex. Poethics is a theory and 
        practice of turbulence, of nomadic forms or forms that never settle into 
        place but rather consist of breaking patterns (like breaking news). Retallack 
        herself prefers the concept of swerving, &quot;the sudden zig or zag of 
        rogue atoms&quot; to which Epicurus gave the term &quot;clinamen&quot; 
        (p. 2). So we are to think of the poethical essay as having the fragmenting 
        structure of the weather rather than the unitary repose of objects. <br>
        <br>
        As an example Retallack gives us &quot;Blue Notes on the Know Ledge,&quot; 
        which begins:<br>
        <br><blockquote>
        What is the metaphysics of the ontology of the physics of the neurophysiology 
        of the epistemology of blue? How many was could I you s/he they we reshuffle 
        the order of these fun-house nouns. Blue-tipped, blue light distance signifiling 
        past slide rule's blue shift. A Western poetics of blue (Is pink the navy 
        blue of India?) is blind sighted at an intersection of the optics of blue 
        (peripheral vision and distance) the paradoxical psychology of blue (religious 
        hope and historical sadness) the epistemology of blue (peripheral vision 
        and cognitive distance). Linea, punctus, circulus, sanctus, sanctus&#133;. 
        blue (p. 63)</blockquote><br>
      &quot;Blue Notes&quot; is a series of wordplaying notes &amp; queries on 
      nineteen citations mostly concerning the various contingencies of blue (which 
      appear to be stand-ins for the many contingencies of &quot;I&quot;): the 
      blue in a certain Giotto painting, the steel-blue of a detective-novel pistol, 
      a remark from Wittgenstein's<i> Blue Book</i>--
 
      <blockquote>If, for instance, you were ordered to paint a particular shade of 
        blue called &quot;Prussian Blue,&quot; you might have to use a table to 
        lead you from the word &quot;Prussian Blue&quot; to a sample of the colour, 
        which would serve you as your copy (p. 65).</blockquote>
        
      <p>Blue skies, blue water, blue laws, singing the blues, the poet Carla 
        Harryman's &quot;Dimblue,&quot; blue noses, &quot;wild blue blunders&quot; 
        (p. 68), cool blue, true blue (as opposed to false blue, or betrayal. 
        But now imagine a blue truth, or blue knowledge, on the model of the blue 
        movie). One recalls William Gass's <i>On Being Blue: A Philosophical Inquiry</i>, 
        which Michael Wood excoriated in the <i>New York Review of Books</i> (August 
        5, 1976): too many word games. As Gass noted, there's something philosophically 
        off-color about blue. It is the color of incertitude (which is, philosophical 
        opinion aside, not a condition of skepticism but a condition of hope). 
        Certitude forecloses hope. Just so, Retallack's main concern in this wonderfully 
        unruly essay is the danger of &quot;knowing for sure,&quot; an assertion 
        of the ego that exposes everything to Plato's sun:<br>
        <br>
      
      <blockquote>The light of the Enlightenment was not to be blue-not 
        full of misplaced and otherwise abused objects, displaced spectators, 
        short-wave blurred edges of historical lament. It was to be the white 
        light that as we know, but cannot see except refractively, contains the 
        entire spectrum-the light of programmatic optimism: Utopian light. The 
        light of hope, with its dependence on undependable pleasant surprises, 
        is, on another hand-to-mouth, blue. It arises out of a strangely luminous 
        pessimism, late in the day. Blue light to be perceived as light at all 
        requires an oblique angle of vision, an averting of the eyes from the 
        glare of our cultural foreground toward the silent periphery that is our 
        future. Blue-last and first color visible at twilight (p. 77).</blockquote>
        Blue is just possibly the most plurisemantic and therefore shady of colors. 
      This helps to explain why in Retallack's spectrum blue (not pink) is the 
      color of the feminine, from baby to indigo. I do not think blue can be pictured 
      in words, but one should still try to distinguish a blue funk from a brown 
      study. 
      <p>The feminine is the chief recurrent topic of the essays in <i>The Poethical 
        Wager</i>. For Retallack the feminine is a mode of complexity-not so much 
        a gender category as a form of life that a man might inhabit if willing 
        to chance it, as when John Cage says: &quot;'I am willing to give myself 
        over to the weather. I like to think of my music as weather, as part of 
        the weather'&quot; (p. 198). The feminine in this respect is different 
        from the expression of suppressed experiences that constitutes more traditional 
        feminist writing (p. 116). In &quot;:RE:THINKING:LITERARY:FEMINISM,&quot; 
        Retallack examines the work of Nicole Brossard, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, 
        and Carla Harryman, three contemporary writers committed to the invention 
        of new forms of language as an alternative to the picturing of states 
        of affairs organized around an &quot;I&quot; or a &quot;We.&quot; These 
        writers are closer to<i> Finnegans Wake</i> than to feminist thinkers 
        like Judith Butler, Alicia Ostriker or to poets like Adrienne Rich and 
        Anne Sexton. In addition, Retallack frequently invokes someone you will 
        not have read before, Genre Tallique, author of <i>Glances: An Unwritten 
        Book</i>, a Borgesian masterpiece of feminomasculine anarchism<br>
        <br>
        
      <blockquote>
        <p>Gender/genre is pure experiment. Every boundary construction is a gamble, 
          a dare, a hypothetical with consequences. That most have chosen to repeat 
          old experiments does not logically negate the possibility of new forms&#133;. 
          There are energetic experimental traditions in our culture. It's in 
          their direction our lucky glance falls. Glance, yes. I refuse the word 
          &quot;gaze.&quot; The gaze turns self and other into stone. The glance 
          is light in the gossamer breeze of chance, un coup de d&eacute;s, inviting 
          the unexpected (cited by Retallack, p. 132). </blockquote>
        
      <p>From Genre Tallique Joan Retallack borrows and elucidates her concept 
        of the &quot;experimental feminine,&quot; an aesthetic that cannot be 
        contained within the agonistic M/F lines of so much of recent theory because 
        these terms, masculine/feminine, are merely limit-concepts &quot;for a 
        very complex range of mixes and possibilities that wiggle, slip, slide, 
        elide, combine, recombine, morph, mongrelize&quot; (p. 99). One recalls 
        the philosopher Cora Diamond's great essay, &quot;Losing Your Concepts,&quot; 
        with its argument that losing concepts like masculine/feminine opens the 
        way for the formation of new possible worlds. Economically loss is not 
        a deficit but a gain in freedom.<br>
        <br>
        Just so, Retallack's &quot;The Scarlet Aitch: Twenty-Six Notes on the 
        Experimental Feminine,&quot; is a series of Wittgenstein-like &quot;remarks&quot; 
        against conceptual purity and in favor of &quot;lettristic play, which 
        &quot;operates illegally, strictly on the diagonal, the glancing, tangential, 
        transgressing left-right regulations, right angles of history, institutional 
        rights to dictate meaningful grammars. It streaks through official texts, 
        illuminating subtexts and subliminal noises as letters swerve, collide, 
        coagulate in the wound-the scar in scarlet-the scars of historical/etymological 
        silences&quot; (p. 106). Lettristic play links Hester Prynne's Scarlet 
        A (adulteress swerving through time into angel) to the dropped <i>aitch</i> 
        that situates poethics (or, as one might begin to prefer, poethicks) on 
        the odd side of the street. (Recall the quintessentially lettristic moment 
        in <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> when the narrator, the misbegotten customs 
        inspector, having discovered the faded letter A, presses it to his breast: 
        a gender swerve if there ever was one.) As Retallack happily observes, 
        aitch is &quot;A with an itch&quot; (p. 106), the itch being that there 
        is no is no pure h-sound but only an endless play from catch to cough 
        to ugh! to fish to Henry-no time to list the whole phonemic inventory. 
        The adulteration of sounds and letters, genres and genders, art and poetry, 
        texts and concepts trumps purity in all of its versions of transparency 
        and single-mindedness. Hence Genre Tallique: not so much an alter ego 
        as a mind/body double.<br>
        <br>
        Not surprisingly, Retallack devotes concerted attention to Gertrude Stein 
        and especially to John Cage. &quot;The Difficulties of Gertrude Stein, 
        I &amp; II&quot; is a defense of Stein's &quot;failed&quot; detective 
        story, &quot;Blood on the Dining Room Floor,&quot; which contains a corpse 
        but no detection because it has no story to tell. But Retallack's point 
        is that Gertrude Stein's &quot;fractal&quot; sentences are more at home 
        in opera than in rationative fiction, because opera is a genre open to 
        simultaneities, interferences, and the production of variations that defeat 
        forms structured by their targets. Stein perfected &quot;open form,&quot; 
        the insubordination of elements to any hierarchy, before any of her male 
        contemporaries (Pound, the Objectivists, Charles Olson). Stein's &quot;open 
        form&quot; can be traced back to William James, with his preference for 
        a loose and anarchic way of thinking and speaking that does without universals. 
        As Retallack observes, &quot;open form&quot; has become a well-worn term, 
        but one can rejuvenate it by returning to Stein and renewing the anarchic 
        through new paratactic experiments.<br>
        <br>
        The idea is to appropriate Stein's gift of attention to the singular, 
        trivial, oblivious, seemingly random and meaningless detail. Attention 
        is the central ethical concept of Retallack's feminine aesthetic-an aesthetic 
        she tries to capture with the phrase &quot;complex realism,&quot; which 
        like all realisms is made possible by a concentration on the differences 
        embedded in indifferent, disposable materials. Attention is the main theme 
        of the four essays on John Cage that conclude this volume. In Cage's and 
        Retallack's aesthetics attention is not passive; it is constructive, a 
        mode of assembling of what is happening into new kinds experience-something 
        human beings are very good at doing, if only they would let themselves 
        go, break their routines and leave their comfort zones. Attention cannot 
        happen without change-to be attentive is to alter oneself (no one has 
        to think during routines). This is the motive of John Cage's work, namely 
        to produce experiences of complexity that cause people to change. The 
        assumption here is of course utopian: it is that change is always a surplus, 
        because loss is a modality of freedom. The complex point is that freedom 
        is also a dimension of responsibility-in the end, it is as much an ethical 
        as political concept. You don't walk away from your experiments; or your 
        experiences; you try to understand and justify them practically by how 
        you go on to think and live.<br>
        <br>
        In Cage's work the main idea is not to build structures but rather to 
        set processes in motion, such that what happens in the environment of 
        these processes is to be experienced as internal and essential to the 
        work or event as a whole. So ambient noise is, famously, to be tuned in 
        rather than out. Cage's intention was explore various modes of non-intentional 
        composition that could produce multilayered, unpredictable events in which 
        many different things can happen at once, whether the material is visual, 
        aural, corporeal, or linguistic (or, as was frequently the case, all four 
        together). Retallack shows that the basic principle at work in Cage's 
        compositions is essentially that of the &quot;butterfly effect,&quot; 
        in which large-scale formations develop from simple initial conditions. 
        Chaos-theorists try to map these formations via mathematical equations. 
        Cage was interested in the anarchy of what he set in motion. However, 
        Retallack's chapter on &quot;The Poethics of a Complex Realism&quot; studies 
        the internal kinship between Cage and one of the inventors of chaos theory, 
        Edward Lorenz. What comes out in this chapter is Cage's incredible capacity 
        to appropriate the intellectual world around him to his own aesthetic 
        explorations-for example, in the use of the computer to score events of 
        indeterminate complexity. Lorenz's work on modeling weather systems, Retallack 
        says,<br>
        <br>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>could also describe Cage's approach to composition in which initial 
          conditions (e.g., sound sources, pitch, timbre, amplitude, duration) 
          are fed into the variable slots of a random-number generator program 
          that replicates the operations of chance in the I Ching (a program called 
          ic, with a time values specific version called tic) and then asks the 
          computer to determine how the score (which will initiate the performative 
          music system) is to be notated. Because Cage's scores always incorporate 
          significant elements of indeterminacy, each performance of his music, 
          like each performance of the weather, has a built-in difference of initial 
          conditions whose variations can produce major changes in the system 
          that unfolds (p. 204).</p>
      </blockquote><br>
        In other words, John Cage solved the long-standing problem of the avant-garde, 
        which is how to escape the inevitability of self-imitation. The early 
        avant-garde-dada, for example-solved the problem by taking their act on 
        the road from Zurich to Paris to Berlin to New York, but keeping all the 
        while to their aleatory nonsense. Duchamp solved it by substituting replicas 
        for duplicates-a virtually theological distinction that nevertheless does 
        exact justice to Duchamp's capacity for ironic self-reinevention. Cage 
        solved it by subjecting composition to the constraints of systematic chance 
        operations, which insured that his works would be unconstrained by a habit-forming 
        ego.<br>
      <br>
      Retallack's final essay, &quot;Uncaged Words: John Cage's Dialogue with 
      Chance,&quot; is a much-needed study of Cage as a poet. Two things stand 
      out, namely that his poetry is almost always made of found texts, and that 
      his poems, particularly his mesostics, were frequently performed as lectures. 
      Retallack's favorite text, however, appears to be &quot;Empty Words,&quot; 
      a four-part poem whose words were derived by chance operations from Thoreau's 
      Journal, and which was inspired in part by Norman O. Brown's observation 
      that &quot;syntax&quot; was originally a military term (&quot;arrangement 
      of the army&quot;). So &quot;Empty Words&quot; consists of &quot;Language 
      free of syntax: demilitarization of language.&quot; 
      <p><br>
        <img src="cage.JPG" width="288" height="350"> </p>
      <p>Cage: &quot;What can be done with the English language? Use it as material. 
        Material of five kinds: letters, syllables, words, phrases, sentences. 
        A text for a song can be a vocalise: just letters. Can be just syllables; 
        just a string of phrases; sentences. Or combinations of letters and syllables 
        (for example), letters and words, et cetera. There are 25 possible combinations&quot; 
        (<i>Empty Words</i>, p. 11). In other words: <i>lettristic play</i>, in 
        which the text becomes both phonetically and visually a work or event 
        of complexity, a turbulence of alphabetic noise that we can read by playing 
        along with it, collaborators in an illicit freedom from the usual conditions 
        of semantic compliance. The surprise is that the words one then experience 
        are not empty at all but extremely rich in virtue of the <i>complexity</i> 
        of their arrangement, especially if one is also a careful reader of Thoreau. 
        <br>
        Just so, there is a moral to Joan Retallack's story about complex realism, 
        it is that nothing is meaningless so long as we do not foreclose our capacities 
        for attention.</p>
