            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief imagination of  Christendom, <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante Alighiere, so utterly found himself <br />

              for Church and Empire,  but more likely the colours<br />

              obstinately construe it according to a secular  misunderstanding, in<br />
              a purely biographical  context. For the Troubadours, it is not a ques-<br />
              tion of psychological or biographical events that are successively ex-<br />

              good, 'and all his followers'&mdash;the last great  Emperor <br />
              of the Holy Roman Empire (the title lasted until<br />
              1806), Frederick II (d. 1250) &mdash;of whom it is said <br />
              that he had a man  imprisoned in a sealed wine vat <br />
              and left him to perish under watch to prove  that<br />
              the soul died with the body, if  it could not escape&mdash;<br />
              and among them Guido Cavalcanti's father and <br />
              father-in-law,  so condemned while Guido was<br />
              still  alive, neither of whom had so experimented <br />
              with human destiny&mdash;only Florentines  in the midst <br />

            in modern terms a fortuneteller paradises&mdash;</p>
            <p>              I think  of the friendship and estrangement of Dante <br />
              and Guido, whom Dante names 'the  first among my <br />

        the arms of  Beatrice&mdash;for hers is the first name of the<br />
love that moves his language among  the stars&mdash;this <br />

  in no way altered by the  upsurge in the political, sociological, or <br />

the religious: there are the contortions and turgescence  of its exhaus-<br />

        for the  gods, for their wandering or their infinite disappearance, <br />
  or else for no god,  that is another matter: it is another question <br />
  altogether, and it is not  something that can be grasped between <br />
  the pincers of the religious, nor indeed  between those of atheism.</span></p>

<p> poets who took the initial  steps into our  uncovered <br />
Hell ran wildly into a dark forest&mdash;<span class="body_italic">una selva oscura</span>, say,</p>
<p> Shelley, living at Lerici on the Gulf of Spezzia in<br />
              1822, starting to write <span class="body_italic">The Triumph of Life</span>&mdash;beautiful <br />
        <span class="body_italic">terza rima</span> in honour of  Dante&mdash;bring him into a<br />
vision&mdash;he thinks he sits beside a public way where<br />
he  sees 'a great stream / Of people there . . . hurrying<br />
to and fro, / Numerous as  gnats upon the evening <br />
gleam'&mdash; 'one mighty torrent'&mdash;a chariot comes 'on <br />
the  silent storm of its own rushing splendour'&mdash;and<br />
in it sits 'a Shape, as one whom  years deform'&mdash;and <br />
the charioteer, 'A Janus-visaged Shadow,' drives the  <br />
'wonderwing&egrave;d team'&mdash;whose shapes are lost 'in <br />
thick lightenings'&mdash;'a triumphal pageant  of a captive<br />
multitude' that becomes a 'sad pageant'&mdash;half to <br />
himself, he asks,  'And what is this? Whose shape is <br />
that within the car? And why&mdash; ' &mdash;when suddenly  <br />
a voice answers, 'Life!'&mdash;so,</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="body_italic">That what I thought was an old root which grew <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strange distortion out  of the hillside,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was indeed one of those deluded crew,</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the grass, which  methought hung so wide <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And white, was but his thin discoloured hair, <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that  the holes he vainly sought to hide,</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were or had been eyes</span>&mdash;<br />
</p>
<p>this is Jean  Jacques Rousseau&mdash;displacing the fierce <br />
  dignity of Virgil in Dante's  <span class="body_italic">Comedy</span>&mdash;Rousseau, whom <br />
  Shelley had revered as emblematic of 'political and  <br />
  metaphysical transition'&mdash;of originary language&mdash;of <br />
  revolutionary possibility&mdash;of  human liberty through <br />
  oppositional writing&mdash;of the stake in desire of any <br />
  one of  us&mdash;</p>
<p>              In Shelley's  vision, we see the Chariot herd, tether, <br />
        and roll over the wise, the famous,  age and youth&mdash;<br />
        now, Rousseau insists upon this endless passing on <br />
      of life&mdash;but  Shelley interrupts:</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="body_italic">'Mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of people, and my heart is sick  of one sad thought&mdash;Speak!'</span></p>
<p> Rousseau replies with the story of his own love&mdash;<br />
  when 'the bright  omnipresence/ Of morning . . . / <br />
  And the sun's image radiantly intense'</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="body_italic">'Burned on the  waters of the well that glowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like gold, and threaded all the forest's maze <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With winding paths of emerald fire . . .</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A shape of light'</span></p>
<p> Rousseau tells  us that he asked that she 'Pass not away<br />
upon the passing stream'&mdash;she offers  him a cup to<br />
'quench his thirst':</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="body_italic">&nbsp;'I rose; and,  bending at the sweet command, <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched with faint lips the cup she raised, <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  suddenly my brain became as sand<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where the first wave had more than half erased <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The track of deer on  desert Labrador;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the wolf, from which they fled amazed,</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Leaves  his stamp visibly upon the shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the second bursts;&mdash;so on my sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst  a new vision, never seen before.'</span></p>
<p> shadows,  phantoms, ghosts&mdash;'like small gnats and<br />
flies'&mdash;'like discoloured flakes of  snow'&mdash;which the <br />
youthful glow melts and the snow extinguishes&mdash;<br />
even Dante, whom  the poem honours with its<br />
rhyme, is seen on the 'opposing steep' and will<br />
        be swept away as the chariot  climbs&mdash;Rousseau<br />
continues:</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="body_italic">'Desire, like a lioness bereft</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Of her last cub, glared as it died; each one <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that  great crowd sent forth incessantly <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those shadows, numerous as the dead leaves  blown</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In autumn evening from a poplar  tree.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each like himself and like each other were <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first; but some distorted  seemed to be</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Obscure clouds, moulded by the casual air; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of this  stuff the car's creative ray <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought all the busy phantoms that were there,</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As the sun shapes the clouds; thus on the way <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask after mask fell from  the countenance <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And form of all; and long before the day<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Was old the joy which waked like heaven's glance <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleepers in the  oblivious valley, died;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some grew weary of the ghastly dance,</span></p>
<p> <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And fell, as I have fallen, by the wayside. . . .</span></p>
<p> again  Shelley cuts into this continuous flow of <br />
  despair, leaves us and the poem with only his <br />
  own question in six words&mdash;</p>
<p>  <span class="body_italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then, what is life?' I cried</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>        before he drowned&mdash;</p>
<p>        Shelley  and Rousseau&mdash;like many of us&mdash;were en-<br />

tempted to say that the correct  expression for the <br />

and I ponder Giorgio Agamben's reply: '. . . if the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="body_italic">&nbsp;</span><span class="body_14_italic">Infancy &amp; History</span><br />

at the existence of the world is the existence of  <br />

the existence of language?<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the only  possible answer to this question is human<br />
life, as ethos, as ethical way. The  search for a <span class="body_italic">polis</span> and <br />

<p><br />
        in this  task of Hell&mdash;indebted to Dante&mdash;I hear <br />
        Ezra Pound's magnificent, poetic  interrogation<br />
        of the  great crystal&mdash;stained by anti-Semitism and <br />
        twentieth-century political  shame&mdash;among us now, <br />
        as if they owned a percentage of the human mind <br />
        of&mdash;this  viscid Western paradigm&mdash;transmuted into<br />
silence&mdash;</p>
<p><br />
        'To what  is the poet faithful?' Agamben asks, uncov-<br />
        ering a vocation&mdash;faithful to the  immemorial, for <br />
        which we have used the word gods&mdash;faithful to the <br />
        emptiness of  language&mdash;faithful to what is <span class="body_italic">first in <br />
      mind</span>, word by word and daily yet unformed&mdash;</p>
<p>in 1963, an  Italian reporter named Luigi Pasquini met<br />
  Pound in the Tempio Malatestiano in  Rimini:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When I  reach him he is standing in the sacristy <br />
  of the church, a tiny room that  formerly housed its <br />
  relics. Above the door is Piero della Francesca's fresco  <br />
  depicting Sigismondo Malatesta as he kneels before<br />
  his patron saint. Pound is  standing beneath it, sur-<br />
  rounded by people.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I  approach him slowly, nervously, until I am <br />
  directly before him, face to face. I  look him in the <br />
  eye, and inquire: &quot;Ezra Pound?&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He does  not respond. He stares at me, silent, and <br />
  his mouth hints at a smile.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I  insist, and repeat his name. He gazes at me, arch-<br />
  ing his eyebrows for a  moment, but says nothing.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I fear I  must be mistaken and address my glance to<br />
  the woman beside him. She peers up at  him, then<br />
  nods, reassuring me that it is him.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I offer  him my hand, and he takes it in his own, I <br />
  do not tell him my name, but I make  clear that I know<br />
  his books. . . . He understands, it seems. He gives a <br />
  sign of  assent, but continues to remain silent.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our hands are still clasping each other. &quot;This is  <br />
  the hand of the great American poet,&quot; I offer. (&quot;La <br />
  mano del grande  poeta americano!&quot;)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And at  last his voice emerges, his first words,<br />
  uttered in a tranquil Italian accent  without a trace <br />
  of an Anglo-American inflection: &quot;I am not great.&quot;  <br />
  (&quot;Non grande.&quot;)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Swiftly  I reply: &quot;&mdash;you are among the greatest.&quot;<br /> 
  (&quot;Grandissimo.&quot;)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But the  conversation falters, and I grow uncertain. <br />
  Through friends I had heard that he  was living in <br />
  Rapallo, but a stray remark from Miss Rudge indicates <br />
  they have  just come from Venice. I try to take up the <br />
  topic: &quot;Where are you living  now: in Rapallo? Or in <br />
  Merano with your daughter, or in Venice?&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He will  not reply. He looks at me again, with a<br />
  mocking gaze.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I  persist: &quot;Rapallo, Merano? Venice, Rome?&quot;<br /> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nothing. He is still  silent, his gaze fixed on me,<br />
  like someone playing a guessing game.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I press  on: &quot;So where are you living now?&quot; I con-<br />
  tinue, &quot;Where?&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At last he lowers his head, slowly, and put his<br />
  mouth to  my ear so that no one can hear us. His<br />
  voice is a whisper, rasping: &quot;I  live in hell.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This leaves me bewildered.  Here we are in church,<br />
in a sacristy in fact (even if it is the sacristy of a  pa-<br />
ganizing temple)&mdash;in a place, in short, as far as pos-<br />
sible from Erebus or  the underworld of Lucifer. And <br />
yet he says we're in hell. I fail to understand  and <br />
want to pursue it: &quot;Which hell do you mean? The <br />
hellish tourism? The  inferno of the war, here in<br />
Rimini? the hell of Rome? Of Italy? Of the  world?&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He is silent again. At last  he moves his hands: he <br />
places them before his stomach, and slowly lifting<br />
them  to the level of his heart, as the traces of light in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="body_14">cited  in L.
