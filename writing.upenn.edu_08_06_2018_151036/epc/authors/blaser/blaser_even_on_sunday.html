        I  don't know anything about God but what the human record tells <br />
        me&#8212;in whatever  languages I can muster&mdash;or by turning to <br />
        translators&mdash;or the centuries&mdash;of that  blasphemy which defines god's <br />
        nature by our own hatred and prayers for  vengeance and dominance&#8212;<br />
        that <span class="body_italic">he</span> (lower case and questionable pronoun) would  destroy by a <br />
        hideous disease one lover of another&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or by war, a nation for what <br />
        uprightness and economic  hide-and-seek&mdash;and he (lower case and <br />
        questionable pronoun) is on the side of  the always-ignorance of politics<br />
in which we trust&mdash;the <span class="body_italic">polis</span> is at the  'bottom of the sea,' as Hannah<br />
Arendt noticed&mdash;and <span class="body_italic">he</span> (lower case and  interrogated pronoun) walks <br />
among the manipulated incompetences of public  thought</p>
      <p align="left"> where  I had hoped to find myself ordinary among others in the <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;streets&#8212;<br />
      a 'murmuring voice of  societies'</p>
      <p align="left"> and so one  thinks them over&mdash;blasphemies all, against multiplicity, <br />
        which is all anyone  knows about god&mdash;and one can only hate them <br />
        so much without becoming <span class="body_italic">halt and  lame in their kingdom of single&shy;<br />
        mindedness</span>&mdash;their having taken a book to have  been once and forever, <br />
        the language behind language that no one has ever spoken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;god's <br />
      what-knot and <span class="body_italic">mystical rags</span> we call flags</p>
      <p align="left"> as  a friend said, 'I'm going to become fundamentalist and call <br />
      everybody asshole'</p>
      <p align="left">and what would the gods be if I asked  them&mdash;our nakedness didn't <br />
        quite fit&mdash;out, as it is, of nature&mdash;yet, there is a  sentiment at <span class="body_italic">the <br />
        intersection between life and thought</span>&mdash;streaks of beyondness in  that <br />
      careless relation</p>
      <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October  came in August and petunias straggled, <br />
      sprawling white faces one at a time,  lobelia browned and continued <br />
      blue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  neighbours cut down the sexual cottonwood which kept the <br />
      whole block from  repainting door-steps for over a month&mdash;by the <br />
      fluffs of its happiness&#8212;</p>
      <p align="left"> so  we are in the midst of a metaphysical washout&mdash;take for example, <br />
        Verlaine and  Rimbaud&mdash;as Hans Mayer says: <span class="body_italic">Being shut out of the <br />
        social order, they sought to  heighten their condition by, say, publicly embracing <br />
        in Brussels and thus  providing the formula for a new 'condition humaine'<br />
        that  called out to be created</span>&mdash;both failed&mdash;both remained in <span class="body_italic">outsiderdom</span><br />
        &mdash;one  continued to rhyme, the other gave up the whole damned <br />
        creation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind this, an Enlightenment, which I'll  return to <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sylvie asked,<br />
        <span class="body_italic">'But what became of the Man?'<br />
        Well,  the Lion springed at him. But it came so slow, it were<br />
three weeks in the air&mdash;'<br />
        'Did the Man wait for it all that time?'</span> I  asked.<br />
        <span class="body_italic">'Course he didn't!' Bruno replied,  gliding head-first down the <br />
        stem of a fox-glove, for the story was evidently  close to its end. <br />
        'He sold his house, and he packed up his things, while the  Lion were coming<br />
And he went and lived in another town. So the Lion ate the  wrong man.' <br />
This was evidently the Moral</span></span> . . . said Lewis Carroll</p>
      <p align="left"> the moral is that something does devour  the <span class="body_italic">existential given</span>&#8212;<br />
        Rimbaud, Mayer writes, <span class="body_italic">does not intertwine with visions  of Sodom in order <br />
      to provoke heaven's fire; it is simply the sole possibility  of his own self-acceptance</span></p>
      <p align="left"> <span class="body_italic">being  shut out of the social order</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rimbaud  writes <span class="body_italic">de poss&eacute;der la verit&eacute; <br />
        dans une &acirc;me et un corps</span>, which Mayer interprets to  say <span class="body_italic">being alive<br />
        in  the full sense of body and soul</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  truth is being alive, until you break <br />
        on it<br />
        <br />
        ah,  Laius, when you ran off with the youth Chryssipus, the Sphinx <br />
        flew to a  whistling stop in Thebes&mdash;and fire fell on Sodomites, on <br />
        each one of them, and,  I'll be damned, almost everybody&mdash;tell me a <br />
        tale to explain sublime  biology&mdash;then, tell me another to explain<br />
sublime human nature&mdash;and murder;  unmythologized, fell on 20th&shy;<br />
century outsiders&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pollution  of what in the momentary hangup of<br />
        the  vast biology of things, desiring?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a  covenant with whom?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;androsphinx, recumbent lion with the head of a man, answer  me&#8212;<br />
that is to say, each one of us</p>
      <p align="left"> the sublime, dear everybody and everyday, is not so simply human&#8212;<br />
        overwhelms&mdash;<span class="body_italic">uncanny</span> is Hannah Arendt's word for the face of it&#8212;<br />
        <span class="body_italic">dangerous&mdash;severe, as a  blow&mdash;mysterious</span>&mdash;on which the <span class="body_italic">existential<br />
      given</span> floats&mdash;the passions of</p>
      <p align="left"> and Hans Mayer notes the tying and untying that confines things: <br />
        <span class="body_italic">At the  height of the Victorian era, the Bible is once again, as in Cromwell's<br />
time. . . .  the spiritual and social foundation of everyday life</span>&mdash;O, the once&shy;<br />
again in which  we trust&mdash;<span class="body_italic">Declaration is made in the Bible of what is<br />
proper for  woman and what is not. The Bible depicts that which God punished<br />
        in Sodom. St. Paul only confirmed the curse</span> one's mind may have a <br />
        certain  affinity with Christopher Marlowe's, if it is true, as his <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roommate<br />
        Thomas  Kyd tells us, that he thought the apostle Paul a swindler&#8212;<br />
        who taught a curdled  godhead and a curdling view of the existential <br />
      given&mdash;and the black milk of it  is blasphemy, so to revile existence</p>
      <p align="left"> in the midst of  this, an Enlightenment which first and foremost posited <br />
        an <span class="body_italic">equality of men and  women, including homosexuals</span>&mdash;religion and<br />
      sexuality go hand in hand in the  apple-light</p>
      <p align="left"> it was not to be merely law, like free speech, but a mental practice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what  developed, in the guise of a Darwinian terror advancing in<br />
evolutionary form,  was the lion body with a man's head, walking in <br />
the garden, so that <span class="body_italic">the  underlying principles of liberty and equality, not<br />
        even taking fraternity into account, inordinately encouraged combatting  all<br />
forms of outsiderdom in favour of what Ihab Hassan calls 'quantities of  normed <br />
phenomena'</span>&mdash;normed existence excludes the <span class="body_italic">existential given</span>, not being<br />
alive in the full sense of body and soul&mdash;and <span class="body_italic">extends, not merely perverts</span><br />
that  which calls itself normality into political form but Mayer asks, <span class="body_italic">what <br />
is it  then if the precipitating step outside, into the margins, is a condition of<br />
        birth, a result of one's sex, parentage, physical or spiritual makeup?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then<br />
      one's existence itself becomes a breaking of boundaries</span></p>
      <p align="left"><br />
        we can thereby  return to ourselves a measure of freedom, and take form<br />
the work of a  lifetime&mdash;in this breaking of boundaries&#8212;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against,<br />
        as Mayer says, <span class="body_italic">a global disposition of thought toward annihilation, which <br />
        thinks to admit only majorities in the future and is determined to equate  <br />
        minorities with 'worthless life' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worthless  are the Jews, there the blacks [and <br />
        aboriginals], somewhere else (and  everywhere) the homosexuals, women<br />
      of the  type of Judith and Delilah, not least the intellectuals keen on individuation .  .</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="body_italic"> 'They should all be gassed': the expression has crept into everyday  language <br />
        Woman is not equal to man. Man is manly man, whatever is to be  understood<br />
by that: the feminine man stands out from the race and thereby  becomes worthless <br />
life. Shylock must be exterminated: the only final solutions  are fire and gas</p>
      <p align="left"> extreme remedies&mdash;pharmakons&mdash;Mayer reminds us, have been <br />
        proposed: for  example, Klaus Mann writing in 1949&mdash;remember <br />
        when that was!&mdash;calls for. . . <span class="body_italic">the  concerted mass suicide of intellectuals: to <br />
        bring public opinion in the world,  in the integrity and autonomy of which he<br />
      quite clearly still believed, to  its right senses</span></p>
      <p align="left"> well, we know now that this  would disappear with a headline in the<br />
Entertainment pages, or it might make the  Arts and Books section <br />
along with obituaries and sportsmanship, in <span class="body_italic">The Globe  &amp; Mail</span>&mdash;and <br />
intellectuals?&mdash;Mann had not noticed that point in the space of  <br />
intelligence where they join the system, higgledy-piggledy&mdash;I think <br />
of that recent  hustle in the United States, offering the end of history<br />
like a dinky-toy,  democracy, pinking, blueing, and off-whiting in plastic<br />
&mdash;'My goodness!' everyone  said, 'They've discovered Hegel!' and  <span class="body_italic">Time</span><br />
<span class="body_italic">Magazine</span> thought he was little known&mdash;and  I said, 'My goodness! <br />
Francis Fukuyama, so we finally got here, there,  anywhere'</p>
      <p align="left"> so to be reminded once again of Puddin'head Wilson:<span class="body_italic"> It was wonderful<br />
to  find America, but it would have been more wonderful to miss it</span></p>
      <p align="left"> <span class="body_italic">this  unified mankind</span>&mdash;for that's who's there, quantity or lump, at the<br />
end of a  materialist's or an idealist's history&mdash;<span class="body_italic">conceived</span>, Mayer writes<br />
<span class="body_italic">as a homogenized  humanity. Woe to outsiders</span></p>
      <p align="left"><br />
        so  that was it, was it? an <span class="body_italic">Enlightenment that promised equality to men and <br />
        women,  including homosexuals!</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an age in  the hole, running three <br />
        centuries, surely allows one to say, 'Listen, you  assholes, a <span class="body_italic">metaphysical <br />
        washout</span> means you've lost your top soil'<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        and  this system aims exactly&mdash;<span class="body_italic">at the heart of our social existence</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to <br />
        be an outsider <span class="body_italic">by virtue of our  existence</span>&mdash;like statues come to life by<br />
moonlight in the child's desiring  mind&mdash;has the advantage of voices,<br />
and their attentions, each to each, among  quantified multitudes who <br />
wander <span class="body_italic">the computations and rationalities that belong  to no one</span>&mdash;also going, <br />
going, gone into the <span class="body_italic">corpus Christianum</span> with its sadly  separated body <br />
and soul</p>
      <p align="left"> among these voices, I  think of Montaigne: <span class="body_italic">Embraces remembered (or still vaguely hoped far) are 'our  final accolades'</span></p>
