      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; realities without  earth and sky which are cultural habitudes</p>
      <p align="left"> <span class="body_bold">and the  cultural</span>, which&#8212;not limited by high, low or middling&#8212;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is conflict around the  creation of reality, and may be<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invisible as thought is, and is neither  formulaic&#8212;bonded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like chemicals&#8212;nor nostalgic, which is a dangerous and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transcendent condition, having forgotten that  transcendence <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like ourselves is historical, even in dreams</p>
      <p align="left"> <span class="body_bold">and the  social</span>, which is a struggle against dominations and powers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the society of which  is recently made up of those who were not <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; previously there</p>
      <p align="left"> <span class="body_bold">and mass  culture</span>, which is new, misunderstood and ungenerous <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about historical  consciousness, mirrors privacies that dis&shy;<br />
