      swimming in the black river a tale emerges<p>
      twists and turns about her sometimes urgent<p>
      sometimes mirror blank         she doesn't play<p>
      lazy riverine thought the water lip laps<p>
      surfaces and resumes such talk along her flanks<p>
      that strength rules out as need walks in<p>
      riparian parties onto the wintery tombolo<p>
      <i>river I put my trust in </i>plum blossom words<p>
      dragged under leaving no language safe<p>
      from itself  a girl going to meet her mother<p>
      is abducted marries death fixes destruction<p>
      in her own image    the script has lashed her<p>
      to sufficiency and reticence those broken limbs<p>
   in the current she steps from wholly diffident

               and with rescues to effect  peachleaved <i>nymph<p>
               sorrowing</i> (are you sorrowing?) on the waters<p>
               bearing you to heaven's  presumptuous grin<p>
               mock pusuits and marriage beds collapse tile letter<p>
               space where a diction hides her people   bride fly out<p>
               of his hand who wades the Money Pool at sunset<p>
               and stumbles across the aporia at dawn singing<p>
               <i>heaven is here in a kiss</i>   gifts of prophecy and hearing<p>
               pucker the valley of that leaf you copied<p>
               to the body in perpetuity   your mouth is leaves<p>
               on his face nymphae peachleaf bride<p>
               of loops and costume change swirling cerulean<p>
               in the stream a blue lotus a white lotus vanishing<p>

       his face a court of angels upriver<p>
       twelve dynasties east and drumming the morning star<p>
       into the arms of the sun   your <i>ha</i> is an almond in flower<p>
       above the heart that hears his <i>hu</i>  and is unbound<p>
       uproarious with aeons going past in a shout<p>
       a shimmy on the grape ropes a ripple up the pool<p>
       beholder to beggar to pleader please<p>
       <i>walk with me here in the spring</i>         there is no foot<p>
       can be imagined without its wing no convention<p>
       without the literal honey the literal where<p>
       and when and how the literal sleeps as on a body<p>
       of water solely its coeval estimate of drift<p>
       <i>Angelike  where</i> twelve twelves with wings<p>
       upraise another hungry drummer of spring

             <i>ah persienne</i>     the wind takes my breath away<p>
             I see it over the blue islands laughing like six children<p>
             looking out to sea    their voices rise higher and higher<p>
             their mountain is the bellied sail taking them now<p>
             to meet everything that was wished      in tile printed folds<p>
             rivers of air gardens of wind and the sea-going craft<p>
             drawn up near the place they have called Paradise<p>
             <i>ah persienne</i>   breathless they reassign what is given<p>
             I was asleep dreaming in a dark place      it pressed<p>
             on me and I was afraid      the weeping dove was lost<p>
             to die sea roads (lie air gardens had forgotten her<p>
             deft play about the topsails    it is recalled<p>
             by the high voices in their eagerness to be<p>

             spray of blossom whiter than oceans<p>
             jumping together over the reef run wild<p>
             into the sea   <i>I go to libraries<p>
             because they are the ocean </i>the spray of blossom<p>
             the is bending passion <i>a wavecrest</i> mountaineer<p>
             of the word and the body which reads <i>Everest</i><p>
             floating like that like a summer's night resolved<p>
             <i>a glitter in the long hazy dawn</i>    and dove<p>
             among the waves at last herself morning<p>
             and evening star but one body I<i> not my eyes</i><p>
             reading day in day out the little distance<p>
             carried forward by the jacaranda in bloom<p>
             over the gate and the foot jubilant in kicking<p>
             its elemental doubts into the sky <i>per se</i>
