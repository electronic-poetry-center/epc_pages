      <i> dolce</i>

       oranges seem to grow wild in the bay that is cloud<p>
       carried by the wind there my boys swim out<p>
       of the easterly blow <i>Haukapua</i> they shout<p>
       the huff and the hook the kick and the splash<p>
       the green bay is full of their golden bodies persistent<p>
       ungentle the wind rides overhead as they trail back<p>
       for showers by the open window a towel on the pillow<p>
       <i>sweet rhythms of the bach</i> where they wake and sleep<p>
       to arithmetical Variations on shelter and a doorway<p>
       the performance of the sun at noon a memory printing<p>
       windmills under the canopy of leaves   <i>highly aromatic</i><p>
       days of no event but virtuoso growth how tall<p>
       they are how straight of limb what storms of noise<p>
       the keyboards take to be sure the game proceeds
<p>

<p>
        <i> gelling away
<P>
<br>
         angel wings beating harder than ever</i> light drumming<p>
         on skinny shoulders pertinent to select displays of<p>
         temper and charm       it was always important to knock<p>
         with your elbow a dozen beer smoked kahawai something<p>
         to put on the table     then to waer as little as possible<p>
         as long as possible to cat late sleep lots and sit around<p>
         talking in the dark remembering <i>the buzzing of the bees<p>
         in the lemonade trees</i> looking over at Paku so built up<p>
         big rock candy mountain on its estuary of song<p>
         hurricane surf that had to be swum hand in hand<p>
         under skies brilliant enough to discreate a cyclone<p>
         there is white sand mile after mile in loneliness<p>
         and crushed shells giving it a border of violet<p>
         we stop later for the golden oysters of Miranda

            <i> a nautilus</i>
<p>
<br>
             I put the children to bed and go out<p>
             hunting the ancestors     the one who is afraid<p>
             of the night adrift tip there in his deep blue covers<p>
             the one who will curl between us so quietly<p>
             nobody wakes and he is safe      I have left them again<p>
             unable to sleep and knowing their sleeping<p>
             is my return <i>to the wide nets washing out in moonlight</i><p>
             they stir as the house gears down they call out<p>
             as I pass I call back I am there when they stagger about<p>
             to gulp water and pee     they lock the doors I left open<p>
             and skim up ladders in their sleep    I need them<p>
             they prevent my disappearance from the world<p>
             they bring me back howling overacting for my blurred<p>
             attention the cradle boat drawn out on the falling tide

      <i> slaying put</i>
<p>
<br>
       the girl on the fridge found her walled-up skin<p>
       but won't be without her magnetic babes    they frolic<p>
       around her a sea of alphabetic cries AzGVw sLK3<p>
       yY hSPr fl0Op low on the feminine with a modicum<p>
       of consonantal drift <i>you get the picture</i> we get<p>
       the picture thrown around and stuck back <i>baby baby</i><p>
       my sINGER Flips her fishy tail     <i>Mistakes I know<p>
       I've made a few</i> the impossible back-arch her attempts<p>
       at keeping it all up in the air <i>Citrus limetia</i> rare and interesting<p>
       though worthless a horticultural curiosity which version<p>
       do you want three commas and a dash or four ellipses<p>
       following a special form of berry yes a <i>hesperidium</i><p>
       what could be kept separate was never worth the bother<p>
       only human now she flippers every little morph<p>

      the Nuyoricans went to Piano Beach and found tai tane<p>
      unbelievably gentle   the messages were adjuncts<p>
      to their honeymoon performed in blacksand with a bag<p>
      of hot plums and a modesty of towels    we clapped<p>
      the lipsticks untwirling on the front veranda at home<p>
      we waited for the remembered fragrance and we listened<p>
      for the old motors overhead in the long light evening<p>
      <i>candy I call my sugar candy</i> and the letters he wrote her<p>
      persist with orangeblossom snipped from the ivory lace<p>
      of her panniers   <i>don't forget to change your flying boots</i><p>
      she wrote him on the invitation thinking maybe<p>
      of this frangipani coming into flower on the porch<p>
      <i>most admired veranda</i> and of the hesper ride<p>
      his DC 3 still charters for our collaborating hearts
