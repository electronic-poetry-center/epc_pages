 experience and language as reciprocal ... recognizing<br>
to a matter of degree /of unfast night/

</center></font><br><br>

experience awakened: invent and receive ... performance /recovered/ that recognizes
multiple matters of degrees, an inclusive inventing, embracing also its emptiness-a
matter and a transparency, roiling gently ... not /only/ language in the service of
experience, experience and discourse timidly asleep together-an alchemy of experience
into language, act of descriptive translation ... capturing the present concludes it
into an idea of the past, a convention of history ... language supplying imagination
limits the invented experience of language-or rather experience awakened to language
... it sweeps itself unawares into a discourse of the clearly immortal even if
unfamiliar ... rather an unfast, a slow detached feast pausing for stretches into the
quick of perception and collapsing the hierarchy of tenses ... rather what Robin
Blaser, writing of Jack Spicer, says "involves a reversal of language into
experience, which is not a dialexis between ourselves or a discourse true only to
itself, but a broken and reforming language which composes a 'real'" ... language as
experience, which starts the recovery of lost perception ... its illegibility expands
the instant, shatters it into a plural feasible, breaks the poverty of camps
(imagination, personality) troubled by experience and language loosened to blur into
one another or self/self/other easily slipping into one another (yet these also being
discrete and being both and none, does not have to be one ... not only which metaphor
one values more) to publicly intimate a truce acknowledging their violent and painful
origin, proclaiming the emptiness of origins, the legible futility of the original
... Leslie Scalapino's recovery of a public realm in which convention is not
transparent but which consists of bodies in motion shaping speech, speech as bodies
in motion; a public world recognized as phenomenological, and just as void of
inherent meaning and existence as any other category (Nagarjuna) ... not to infuse
nominal or conventional categories or actions or linguistic phenomena with negative
value, or reflexion with nihilism ... already the gesture of bringing the recognition
of the emptiness of the nominal or conventional into being is subject to this
acknowledgment, soon misremembers/dismembers itself ... breaks /in order to/ re-form
then to break again in a different place ... the murder of one shape suggests a
plagiarized and embryonic occasion, unknowing and unraveling redemption ... night
suspended, a puzzle prevails ... a shadow of its message when public desire resembles
errant center leveling the several times ... intended encounters with ragged
witnesses in the town square /merely/ dormant ... so to implant a gifted twilight
with otherwise in a placed/displaced intervention has a result? ... this would
imitate the orderly passion of the crowd, in which memory regularly survives in the
abstract as linked motive ... perspective breathes, and is always around the corner
from the calm structure of night, to which entrance is suspended ... /real/ events
glide and morph /and/ here one finds the spell of the lingering particular, a
deceptively calm place, /vividly/ remembered into subtle variations, memory's
animation in action ... dissolving each particular lucidity into a palpable mist into
which the syllable bird flies, sometimes (timidly) approaching commerce between
branches of a contingent genealogy ... outside ourselves isn't what we feel it to be
... the /moment/ isn't fragile, the moment isn't ... neither is there a world
exterior to life clear of consciousness, though we might invent it ... the
conventional doesn't not exist ... it awakens to us ... we as other to a public
discourse that holds meaning and historicizes it to partake of its solidified
identity? ... rather historicize endlessly and with pregnant understanding of /each/
history ... we as other to ourselves, to a language creating rebel, an encountering
something, a something encountering something else /outside/ in the public or outside
a group, however amorphously spoken of ... there is no end to other, yet
internalized, it's finite? ... travel a way to conceive words mattering and moving,
pushing through language to experience- ... the infancy of syntax ransomed and
scrapped, saved and frayed ... along tracks no truer than the words that would fix
them, lovelorn for a defiant sculpting of rails ... odd thinking of the vehicle of
awakened experience getting there ... arriving, it enters its polar realm and is
immobilized, becoming compost, matters of degree, for roots in a more temperate zone
... believing that one thinks deeply, the depth composed of the layering of what is
taken for granted as the "real" in private as well as in public ... muscles/synapses
of private/public bodies shape activity (community) and discourse ... the
"composition of the real" takes place on the surface of what is nominally interior or
exterior ... acknowledgment /of depth's conventionality/ laced with despair is
hierarchical, nostalgic for ideal states and measured self ... virginity was never
like this ... but anyway, one doesn't mind saying that one "loves the night" while
sensing the impertinence of the history of darkness<p>
