Your ruin begins here, on the invitation, its <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        nickel-plated manacles; <br>
remember? you went to gloomy London on a wet Sunday; <br>
taxi pumped full of gas I'm talking through the tube <br>
        <br> 

I searched your rooms, your diary, when you were gone, <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        but found nothing <br>
at dawn a flash of grief in the kitchen <br>
like a snapshot, the burn damage years later - <br>
        <br> 

the camera fakes a portrait locked in that domain<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        I listen for your words <br>
in the space between lightning and thunder: <br>
that gangling vitality I loved now seems robotic <br>
        <br>  

art operates alongside white racks of illness <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        cash deposits <br>
notice the gallery owner adjust her taxable assets <br>
this twinkling is brought on by their medication <br>
        <br>  

it's due to a scattering of black tablets<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        rattling in a tin <br>
yes I only spent time and money on the telephone call <br>
so you could feel better, so you would get happier <br>
        <br> 

a week later I understood her spleen philosophy<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        her greenish look <br>
they can judge that to mean intimacy, or torment <br>
I'm capable of anything when I'm distressed <br>
        <br> 

behind the snow-shouldered hills, mountains of <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        cloud heaped up, <br>
in the gloomy suburb at the foot of Echo Point <br>
everyone can hear their neighbors lying <br>
        <br> 

bad liquor bottled and locked in the truck <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        and Dakota Bitter, <br>
he tilts the seat forward, and finds the weapon <br>
among the rubbish and shadow on the floor <br>
        <br> 

these were the plutocrats of the beach afternoon <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        the lamplight recalled <br>
childhood evenings playing Animal Snap with his <br>
aunt and uncle, lemon squash, a bottle of gin <br>
        <br> 

dressed-up and happy as a prize pig and <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        out-staring everything <br>
I was tainted with the taste of rain<br>
furious people, burnt like meat on a grill <br>
        <br> 

oh, what's the use of being the top dog in this <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        obscure province <br>
run off to the big city, get sick in a hailstorm <br>
waiting for your acolytes in a red fur coat <br>
        <br> 

under the holiday moon she looked like a pudgy pup, <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        slush on the windscreen <br>
clanky wipers, the blue cloud, and the furniture <br>
she was sobbing but she conducted the orchestra <br>
        <br> 

her Mickey Mouse socks like a shout, an affidavit <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        attacking the drab <br>
and now the radio speaks from our Sister Cities <br>
with stories of angels seen haloed though a prism <br>
        <br> 

lawn-drenching dawn unfolds her sprinklers<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        under a tree - <br>
you have to take a deep breath and drive him there <br>
to the greenhouse, among the squeaky parakeets <br>
        <br> 

his confused and malevolent misdirections got <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        everyone lost <br>
you are your own discipline, a motor in a shell, <br>
this is a smeared vision of how you see things <br>
        <br> 

wiping the sheet of acetate and looking through <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        the blurry plastic <br>
at some old fool wearing stretch briefs instead of <br>
a nylon swimsuit as the regulations require <br>
        <br> 

his floppy dick hanging out the slot - where's <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        your dignity? <br>
you'd turn up to meet him crying, and you should not; <br>
everything's bronzed like the scales on a baby piranha <br>
        <br>  

my room writes a terrible blank onto the mirrors <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        dead ring telephone <br>
four hundred volts in the shower - is that my fate? <br>
to find myself lost, just as I turn to go home. <br>
