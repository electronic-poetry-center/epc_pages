        <br> 
I can hear the stop-work whistle<br>
down at the Club, can I go home now?<br>
Then I see Grace Kelly, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the young Grace Kelly!<br>
'Starlet Fever', that's what it is. <br>
I keep hearing the word 'workaholic'. <br>
Echoing, echoing. The Doc says <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; take a tablet. <br>
How do you feel down there? Okay?<br>
Take a dive. Bite the bullet. It's <br>
the jim-jams, I've got the jim-jams. <br>
I think he said 'phenomenology'. <br>
I keep hearing jackhammers, it's<br>
the jackhammers, that's what it is. <br>
                <p>

Do you know Jacky Rackett?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do I know Jacky 
Rackett?<br>
Lovely type of a feller. Dropped his packet. <br>
I keep hearing syllables, polysyllables. <br>
Do I know Sherelle? Young Sherelle?<br>
        <p>Then I hear an Appaloosa, getting closer, <br>
the clip-clop racket in the bracken, then <br>
a clattering gallop on the gravel, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hear the hullabaloo. <br>
How d'you do, sir. Jacky Rackett?<br>
Top o'the Paddock, sir, the witch's cat. <br>
Then I can see Grace Kelly again, <br>
up close, it's getting warmer. <br>
        <p>Down here in Third Class it's getting warmer. <br>
Pull the toggle. No, blow the whistle. <br>
I keep hearing the word 'histrionic'. <br>
Is that better? Snug in a rug? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clacketty-clack.                            
<br>
        <p>Do you know Gary Langer? Barry Langer? <br>
They were both practising solicitors. <br>
I keep hearing polysyllables, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then jackhammers. <br>
Now that's a clavier sonata! <br>
That's the cat's pyjamas! No, <br>
it's the Appaloosa! Barry! Gary! <br>
How are you going, you old bastard! <br>
I keep hearing these unpredictable<br>
polysyllables, it's like the Name of God. <br>
Isn't God indelible? Indivisible?<br>
        <p>I can see a Californian kitchen, I'm <br>
visiting Gidget, isn't she cute? <br>
I can almost reach out and touch her, <br>
gently. I pour us a Coke and it bubbles. <br>
Is this Paradise? Is it really Paradise? <br>
        <p>Hey, there's Jack Napier. Jack Napier!<br>
Absolute type of a gentleman. Wouldn't <br>
hurt you with a barge pole. Jack's <br>
a jumper. Jack invented the calculus. <br>
Then I hear a rustling noise, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; highly magnified. <br>
I think I snapped the tape <br>
                <p> 
at the pain threshold, then fell. <br>
Oh Sherelle, will it ever diminish? <br>
Will it ever diminish, and fade away? <br>
Gidget, I'm carrying Gidget, on the beach, <br>
and I stumble! <i>Bugger it! </i> <br>
Down at the Club, the Workers' Club, <br>
the stop-work whistle, should I go home now? <br>
I keep hearing 'intelligent, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; very intelligent'. <br>
Push the toggle-button, the green one, <br>
the illuminated one, no, not that, <br>
the other one! You'll feel <br>
worse at first, considerably worse <br>
at first, until the medicine. Oh boy, <br>
some party! Were you there? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was I there? <br>
I keep hearing 'medical, paramedical'. <br>
Don't you think it's time to pull the plug? <br>
Push the button? I can see Paul de Man, <br>
Paul de Man, is he in Heaven? <br>
I keep hearing 'shoot, parachute'. <br>
        <p>Okay, what odds would you give me? <br>
Push the toggle-button, bird-brain. <br>
This one, or that one? <br>
Go home, time to go home. <br>
Quick, put on the Nazi uniform. <br>
He says 'Quick, Sherelle, do as I say!' <br>
Why should I? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I? <br>
Who do you think I am? He says - <br>
famous Chinese proverbs - he says <br>
'Quick philosopher, dead solicitor!' <br>
Who do you think I am? <i>Paul de Man? </i><br>
        <p>I can hear a whistle, an emergency whistle. <br>
Now I can see the tropical effluent. <br>
I think it's moving in our direction. <br>
Dark stain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dog paddle! Back-pedal! 
<br>
        <p>That's funny, I can't hear a thing. <br>
<i> Ding-dong! </i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone home?
