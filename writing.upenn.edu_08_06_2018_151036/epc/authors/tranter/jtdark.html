        <br> <font face="Georgia" > 
Thunder unrolling over the vulnerable city, <br>
purple and ink-blue, above the huddle of workers <br>
scrambling to commute, some to a bar where <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neon and darkness <br>
        <br> 
conspire to enfold them, the avenues alive with shoppers. <br>
And rustling in the wind high above the age of doubt, <br>
their transparent psyches rain-wet, rent by lightning, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirits and angels <br>
        <br>
adrift in the jet-stream know that we have to die, <br>
each of us heavy with hope but a faint shadow trails <br>
between what we need and what's accessible, at noon <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest and distraction, <br>
        <br>
nightmares at midnight. These ministers query <br>
then relinquish us, but not before this one listens <br>
for alarms or burns, the sigh of passing time, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that one retreating, <br>
        <br>
skin all aglitter, for whom the avenue of blooms <br>
shall never spell 'love'. The drinkers murmur their <br>
ancestors' games, getting it right without <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowing the meaning, <br>
        <br>
code deviation: Drink, and drink. For that teacher <br>
boys were everything, once, holding their breath <br>
and proving their passion from a few paces away. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be cocksure, <br>
        <br>
crowded illusions, old pals, school buddies, dodging <br>
into the past you should resurrect, or guess at, <br>
a dim throng resemblance, who thought of your <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul as a plaything - <br>
        <br>
where to grow frankly through its enigmas means <br>
foreign fucks, sad furious travel, this dilemma: <br>
mud and air, part of the human breath it demands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to those guys <br>
        <br>
rattle and blather, he said, and you didn't remember<br>
that melancholy, the twilight autumn air, then  <br>
the rumpled nameless force pushing us out <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towards the horizon? <br>
        <br>
Garrulous history tells us that greed and ambition <br>
stir the struggle to make great art, but then <br>
the riders gallop up with their strange truth, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troublesome, painful. <br>
        <br>
Secretive rumours hang about, floating over the turf <br>
like a low mist, the way you pitched your gay smiles, <br>
not meaning anything, but who spilt our secrets? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blabbing and telling! <br>
        <br>
Told them the story, but we spoke outline English, <br>
nothing solid, our filthy lies melting into the air. <br>
Buy a memory or two at the pool, who cares if it's <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little dishonest?<br>
        <br>
Too bad you only smile to rake back a smile <br>
to crush a truth, or in an instant forgive, <br>
each time shadows falling across the yard <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid out in plots that <br>
        <br>
seem to be speaking, making a pattern, and <br>
like the wind sneaking past, it's what we're <br>
losing that tugs the brain, leaking out; we <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kiss and a heartache <br>
        <br>
ruins our childhood. Yet - no, though <br>
their cruel trade troubles us, the hot boys <br>
grow, grunt and turn in that awful flux, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;girls become women, <br>
        <br>
summers diminish, the snapshots fade, also the <br>
pesky details and the hot bothers that seem to be <br>
all we can recollect of that holiday, that was <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more like a combat. <br>
        <br>
And I remember the neon glow on her lipstick - <br>
<i>click!</i> - her perfume, its melancholy ambience - <br>
these fragments constrain memory into grief, our <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mortal lot sliding, <br>
        <br>
crushing together those dirty complex diversions. <br>
We each knew awkward love, that frail-leafed orchid, <br>
and on her lap a heap of those diurnal notes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baffled and restless,  <br>
        <br>
breezes at sunset bring us groans and whispers; <br>
now the tide is full that will carry us off, <br>
afloat on that glassy flood, the sky stooping to  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touch us with incense. <br>
        <br>
This is a painting, of a catastrophe cranked up to <br>
the higher range: look at it, sweetheart, you dazzle, <br>
spell benumb my mouth, pink heart-beats<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always retreating, <br>
        <br>
asking for lightness, an enigmatic spice of hope, <br>
but always at my back I hear a brutal rumbling,  <br>
the bursting roar of my own donut-fleshed heart. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trace of my accent <br>
        <br>
colours your laughter, a linguistic infection. Upstream <br>
the marriage blueprint's spoiled, and here on the porch <br>
I'm holding you lightly in a dance embrace, watched by <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;celestial tourists <br>
        <br>
drifting above our foreigner-inflected summer. <br>
My life is just an escapade, not a tragedy, so <br>
thank the energy of the fiery hour, thank that <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loose-lipped emotion, <br>
        <br>
a crisis that lets a new sentiment shape develop. <br>
And our doting neighbours give us what you see, <br>
unwelcome presents, and it's not even an occasion. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endless revision, <br>
        <br>
erasing the discord: there they are, portrayed naked: <br>
two lovers aware of the hourglass - figured space <br>
between us - and the futures they build there, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading a novel <br>
        <br>
one to the other, pulse to pulse signalling <br>
sex, fear and betrayal, culture rearranged <br>
and magically loosened and tightened again, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deep disappointment, <br>
        <br>
appalling encounters, garlands strewn far inland, <br>
haystacks aflame in brilliant streaks in the valleys, <br>
and on that sombre green beside the pond <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirits descending, <br>
        <br>
calmly alighting in the gloom under the trees.  <br>
Here the painter has depicted the world's end, two <br>
plausible powers, the red and the black, demons and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard-hearted men sunk <br>
        <br>
deep in their silent employment - <i>is it for you? And <br>
for you this dismal project, this politics? </i> And yet <br>
the boys still dive and plunge among the foam,  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talking with kisses, <br>
        <br>
lips intermingled, and rest on your jealous breast.<br>
See, the ancestors lie down before that portrait <br>
and the movie palaces of your youthful solitude <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now lie deserted. <br>
        <br>
Rising to meet us, the ebony hand of night. <br>
Here, a stain of moonlight. There, rippling noises, <br>
love swept gasping through it. Disguises, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;painting on linen, <br>
        <br> 
it's a delusion and a false fabric, a sweet elocution <br>
with as little meaning as a blackbird's batty chatter, <br>
the theatre of the mundane drafted onto a backdrop, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfect disorder <br>
        <br>
forming a pattern where the totally random must be given <br>
a motive and a meaning, sketched across the foreground <br>
near his head. So the artist figures things to come, a <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;singular discourse. <br>
        <br>
Longing for meaning can be fixed. First it's a problem, <br>
then it's the cure; but we are dispersed into a rigmarole, <br>
into the telling fishhook of a style, and so he <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fluctuates fiercely, <br>
        <br>
releasing his insights like ink dropped into water.  <br>
The audience shivers, watching everything they knew <br>
fracture, their future a lifeless illusion, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colours dispersing <br>
        <br>
slowly at first, then faster: their career path diagrams <br>
riddled by lightning. I'm nursing a drink at twilight, <br>
looking up at the thunderheads lit from below: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything's blowing <br>
        <br>
into the future that waits for us but doesn't want us,  <br>
nor the children, who await their change of faith, <br>
or so I guess, staring down on the late avenues <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crowded with feelings. <br>
