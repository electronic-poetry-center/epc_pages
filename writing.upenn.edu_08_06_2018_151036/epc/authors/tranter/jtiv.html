      Could you talk about your early years. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font color="#000000" black ><i>John Tranter: </i> I was born in 1943 in 
      Cooma, a little town in the south-eastern mountains of Australia. My father 
      taught in a one-teacher school in the nearby village of Bredbo. It's high 
      country around there, long rolling grassy hills, and pretty much unpopulated. 
      I remember my mother saying that a hot wind blew all summer long, full of 
      dust; in the winter a bitter cold wind, and sometimes snow. We moved to 
      the coastal town of Moruya when I was about four; the climate there was 
      more Californian. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I fell out of the car on the drive to Moruya, late at night. It's almost 
      my earliest memory. On a bend in the dirt road the passenger-side door came 
      open by accident - the car was an old Chevrolet sedan. I'd been asleep in 
      my mother's arms. I fell onto the road and bounced through the blackberries 
      into a ditch. I can still remember staggering to my feet, covered with blood 
      from the gash in my head, and seeing the tail-light disappearing around 
      a bend. It took them a moment or two to realise what had happened, and stop 
      the car. For those few endless seconds it felt very lonely there in the 
      dark. <br>

      a farm, and I grew up there, learning to drive tractors, to plough and sow 
      crops. Later he started a carbonated drink factory making soda pop, and 
      I drove one of the delivery trucks. He'd been affected by the poverty he 
      saw in the Depression, and he virtually worked himself to death; he died 
      when I was nineteen. He was a decent man, and people liked him. <br>

      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: </i> 
      By the time he died in 1962 I'd moved to Sydney and started an intermittent 
      career as a university dropout. I managed nearly a year of Architecture 
      at Sydney University in 1961, and the next year passed some Arts subjects, 
      though I failed first-year English. Then in 1966 I saved some money and 
      went to England on a passenger ship, the <i> Fairstar</i>, and worked at 
      menial jobs in London for a year. Then I hitch-hiked back to Australia across 
      Europe and Asia - Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India - with my girl-friend 
      Lyn, exploring the hippy trail and having various adventures. I was only 
      twenty-four, and Lyn twenty-one. We're still together. I finally took a 
      B.A. degree majoring in Psychology and Literature in 1970 and became a publisher's 
      editor in Singapore. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font> <font face="Georgia" size="3" color="#000099" ><i> John Kinsella: 
      </i> Why poetry? When did you develop an interest in poetry? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: </i> 
      When I was about seventeen. I guess most people start writing poetry in 
      adolescence; it has as much to do with hormones then as anything. In my 
      last year of high school a teacher gave me some poetry to read - D.H.Lawrence, 
      Gerard Manley Hopkins, some Chinese poetry - and suggested I submit something 
      to the school yearbook magazine. I won the prize for the best poem. Mind 
      you, the competition wasn't that tough; this was an agricultural high school, 
      a state-government-run boarding school, and most of the kids there were 
      expecting to go on to a career in farming, God help them. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      It took me about five years to work out what poetry was really about, and 
      to catch up on enough reading to know the areas where I should be putting 
      my energy. Rimbaud was my first real discovery. I latched onto him through 
      a pulp novel based on his life by James Ramsey Ullman titled <i>The Day 
      on Fire</i>, the shorter paperback version. Ullman has him heterosexual, 
      for goodness' sake, writing love-lorn poems to a beautiful but remote girl, 
      when he wasn't busy exploring the coffee-shops of Paris with his poet pals. 
      I guess that's one way of explaining the poems. Then I found the Enid Starkie 
      biography of Rimbaud, and then the Penguin <i>Rimbaud </i>with its sparkling 
      prose translations by Oliver Bernard, and I was away. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="georgia" color="#000099" jtblue size="3"> <i> John Kinsella: 
      </i> You're not thought of as following a particularly French line. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: </i> 
      Well, no, my interest shifted to the Americans, to the poetry coming out 
      of the USA in the fifties and sixties; all the flavours and varieties from 
      Nemerov to Kerouac and back again. That quarter-century in the States - 
      say the early forties through to the late sixties - seems to me a time of 
      extraordinary energy in English writing, like the Elizabethan age, or the 
      Romantic period. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But I was also reading twentieth-century French poetry in translation - 
      Supervielle, Desnos, Reverdy, Michaux - and the German poet Hans Magnus 
      Enzensberger. I've discovered with some dismay that few American poets have 
      heard of Enzensberger. He has a profoundly ironic and richly political view 
      of things; that's a dimension sometimes lacking in the US, I suspect. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i> John Kinsella: </i> Critics 
      sometimes mention Ashbery's name in connection with the supposed difficulties 
      of your work. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i> John Tranter: </i> 
      Well, yes, of course I've read Ashbery; I found his writing refreshing and 
      liberating. I think I came across it first in Donald Hall's anthology <i>Contemporary 
      American Poetry </i>published by Penguin in 1962. That combination of lyrical 
      beauty with violent formal and thematic disruption was exhilarating. His 
      sheer intelligence is daunting too. He's almost Elizabethan, isn't he? It's 
      no accident he borrowed a title from Marvell. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But Ashbery also spent a decade in Paris, and that interest does tie in 
      with my early liking for French poetry. I think you can make out a line 
      of influence that weaves back and forth: from Poe in the US to Baudelaire 
      in Paris, then through Rimbaud, Mallarm&eacute;‚ and Laforgue back into 
      English through Eliot (an American) in London. Then another later strand, 
      from Desnos, Reverdy and Raymond Roussel back to Ashbery and O'Hara in New 
      York. That rather leaves the English out of things modern, doesn't it? There's 
      Auden, of course - another American citizen. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      It begins with the Gothic, and ends up with Ashbery. But Ashbery has a Gothic 
      mode too: I sometimes detect an Edward Gorey tone around the edges of his 
      writing. (Ashbery's friend Frank O'Hara shared a room with Gorey at Harvard 
      in 1949.)</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> <font face="Georgia" color="#000099" size ="3" ><font face="Georgia" color="#000099" size ="3" ><font face="Georgia" size="3" color="#000099" ><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><font face="georgia" color="#000099" jtblue size="3"><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3">Ashbery's 
      interests are bizarrely wide. He's always liked the poems of Ern Malley, 
      the hoax poet invented in Melbourne in 1943. And he's fond of the nineteenth 
      century Scottish doggerel poet William McGonagall. (I have a Scottish Fold 
      cat named after him.) John Ashbery once recited to me - at the end of a 
      rather long evening - the epic McGonagall poem about the River Tay disaster 
      in 1879. In full, and with rolling eyes and a resolute attempt at the Scots 
      accent: a marvellous performance. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> What 
      about O'Hara? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: </i> 
      Frank O'Hara's a wonderful poet, though perhaps because he's less obviously 
      'poetic' and more apparently colloquial, he's less discussed by the critics. 
      He's hard to draw energy from directly, because his style was so intimately 
      attached to his speaking voice, his wit, his accent, his milieu, the brand 
      of cigarettes he smoked. Getting his writing separated from who he was as 
      an actual person is like trying to separate Siamese twins. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Actually there's a lot to learn from quieter poets like Elizabeth Bishop 
      and James Schuyler, I feel. Or younger writers like August Kleinzahler or 
      Elaine Equi. And then there are the alarming and valuable renovations from 
      Leslie Scalapino and Lyn Hejinian and many others. There's so much range, 
      so much variety in American poetry, you hardly know where to begin reading. 
      Perhaps with Paul Hoover's anthology, <i>Postmodern American Poetry </i>(Norton, 
      New York, 1994). You can start from there, with over a hundred poets, each 
      unique and different, and go off in almost any direction! <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> You 
      have said that you want to write new and interesting types of poetry, and 
      you work in a very diverse number of forms. Is there a specific reason behind 
      this? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: </i> 
      Naturally I want my writing to be lively; I think it's an offence against 
      good taste to be uninteresting. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I should say that the culture I grew up in was a provincial one. It's better 
      now, but in the fifties it was awful. You know, the dead hand of the past. 
      I responded to that aggressively; it was the only way to break away and 
      be myself. Part of my interest in finding new forms had to do with that. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Also, on a smaller and more personal scale, I want to keep developing as 
      a writer, from book to book, from year to year. I don't like to see my style 
      settle into a rhetorical stiffness like an old bowl of jelly. I enjoy challenges.

      <br>
      </font> <font face="Georgia" size="3" color="#000099" ><i> John Kinsella: 
      </i> Do you see a necessity to create the New? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: </i> 
      Well, now, what exactly is 'the New'? When I was young, loose forms were 
      new. But for an older me, a few years ago, the Sapphic stanza was new, and 
      that's a stubborn metrical form that's been around for thousands of years. 
      I've used the haibun, from seventeenth century Japan, adapting that to my 
      own purposes. Now I'm fooling around with pantoums, an old Malay form. Where 
      will it end? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Something new is usually interesting because it's new; and then when it's 
      no longer new - so soon, so soon! - it's no longer interesting. It's unfair, 
      isn't it? I think it's more important to do something that's interesting 
      because it engages with something vital in human life and society. Its relation 
      to the passing wave of fashion is not so important. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But there's nothing intrinsically evil about fashion, and it's refreshing 
      to see new things being done. It's salutary to notice how many really excellent 
      poets - from Callimachus to Catullus to Wordsworth to Rimbaud to Eliot to 
      Stevens - were regarded as excessively 'new' and faddish when they began. 
      Catullus and his friends were contemptuously labelled the 'Neoterics', that 
      is, the 'Modernists', people obsessed with being modern, in their own time.

      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      Do you see yourself as an 'Australian' poet? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> When I was younger I made a big thing out of my liking for international 
      writing, poetry from other cultures. But I feel easier with the idea of 
      being Australian as I've grown older and seen more of the world. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      In that case, as an Australian, how do you see Australian poetry relating 
      to world poetry? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> It's part of English-language poetry; a younger branch of the family 
      perhaps. I see it as part of a diaspora of linguistic energy from the center 
      of empire to the periphery. The British Empire, that is. The US belonged 
      to that empire once, of course. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      You see the same thing in Ancient Greece: like Sydney, Alexandria was a 
      polyglot city-port founded as a colony and situated far from the center 
      of empire. The figures are interesting: in the 4th and 5th centuries B.C., 
      twenty-five authors were born in mainland Greece and twelve in other Greek 
      colonies. After 300 B.C. (Alexandria was founded in 331) only five authors 
      were born in Greece proper, while twenty-four were born in the colonies. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      What are some influences on your work drawn from other Australian writers? 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Uh ... I haven't ever felt part of a tradition of Australian writing, 
      though of course whether I like it or not I am, even in saying that. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I like Kenneth Mackenzie's poetry, Kenneth Slessor, many of my own generation. 
      But a lot of what you see in the magazines these days is pretty tedious. 
      Well, it always was, of course. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I suppose Francis Webb is our most brilliant poet, and Sir Herbert Read 
      is right to say that Webb is (from a British viewpoint) unjustly neglected. 
      I mean, he's as good a poet as Patrick White is a novelist, and White, partly 
      through having won the Nobel Prize, is a well known name world-wide. Webb's 
      poetry, for all the respect it has in Australia, is unknown elsewhere. But 
      that's part of the problem of being a poet: you're never going to be that 
      well-known anywhere. And being an Australian makes it worse. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      We don't seem to have produced an original talent with the power or genius 
      of say Auden, Pound, Williams, Stevens, Ashbery or O'Hara. Perhaps you need 
      an older, a larger and a more confident society to do that. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      How central is Sydney to your work? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Until recently I hadn't thought it was that important to my writing, 
      but in my book of long narrative poems (<i>The Floor of Heaven</i>) it seemed 
      to take over, almost as a character, or a kind of weather. People define 
      themselves against the background of their towns or cities, almost as much 
      as their nationalities, though of course city loyalty is provisional. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Sydney affects you because of the space, the bright daylight, the sudden 
      torrential storms, the weather - it's usually sunny and windy, with the 
      scent of the sea in the air. Melbourne has its charms too, of a quieter 
      kind, though it's a horribly cliquey place by comparison. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      Do you have a program of poetics? Is there a particular kind of poetry or 
      an approach to poetry that you would like to see generally adopted? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Oh, God no! I like plenty of variety, the way it is. I used to think 
      I had the answers when I was younger, but that was just the vanity of youth. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I try to stay open to new ideas. And I try to fill out my knowledge of old 
      ideas, which is perhaps more important, seeing there are more of them. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I discovered Callimachus only ten years ago. I have yet to read Shakespeare 
      thoroughly, or the Arab writers. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Then with my writing from day to day I just do the best I can, like any 
      writer. I like to keep pushing the envelope. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      How do you work? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Some people have regular hours. I wish I could do that. I have to push 
      myself to write, plodding through sketched lines and ideas and bad drafts 
      until I get sick of it and stop, or until I allow myself to get distracted 
      by the mail, or the phone, or lunch with a friend, or maybe there's some 
      shopping I just have to do ... Sometimes a draft will come alive and I get 
      a burst of energy, and things go right for a while. Then maybe once or twice 
      a year I'll get caught up in a long run of work, writing maybe ten or twenty 
      poems in a few weeks, some of which survive their further draft transformations. 
      I rewrite a lot, and go through many, many drafts. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I seem to be creative, in a free-associational kind of way, early in the 
      morning. Often trains of words will wander through my mind in the shower, 
      but nothing seems to come of that. They have to be written down for them 
      to develop into a poem. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i>

      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Sometimes. I like fountain pens, but it's hard to find a good one, 
      and it seems impossible to find a good permanent waterproof ink that doesn't 
      attack the plastic part of the pen. Better plastics, that's what we need.

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I've always felt easy with computers, and I've used one as a word-processor 
      since the mid-eighties. It's a wonderful luxury, like having a secretary

      employment, especially creative or demanding work, kills my poetry. I need 
      plenty of daydreaming time to fill up the reservoir, and I've been extremely 
      lucky to have been given so much writing time through the fellowships offered 
      by the Literature Board of the Australia Council, and by the Australian 
      Artists Creative Fellowship scheme. I've had about fifteen years of subsidised 
      writing time, and it's meant a lot to me. <br>

      The Australian government is remarkable in that way; there have been few 
      societies that have treated their creative artists so well in terms of fair, 
      democratic, generous, hands-off, long-term support. Australians are sometimes 
      embarrassed to be reminded how much they like poetry and poets. We put Henry 
      Lawson, a working-class poet and fiction writer who died of drink, on our 
      ten-dollar note, and later the radical poet Mary Gilmore and the conservative 
      poet A.B. ("Banjo") Paterson. <br>

      That confidence about high culture, and support for the arts, that's a comparatively

      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Yes, for many years we internalised a British view of ourselves: we 
      believed what they told us, that we were a simple-minded bunch of colonial 
      hedonists with awful accents, good at golf and tennis and not much else. 
      We're now beginning to see how self-serving that caricature is for the British; 
      how it allows them to feel superior to what is after all a more energetic 
      society, a society with a future, rather than a past. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      As far as literature is concerned, it's a fact that we buy and read many 
      more books and literary magazines per capita than the English or the Americans. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I have many friends in England and in the United States who are writers. 
      Some of them have support from universities or from arts grants and foundations, 
      but it's not an easy life for them. They have to work hard to survive in 
      what seems to me to be an uncaring society, and they don't have that much 
      energy left over for their art. I admire their spirit. Sometimes I don't 
      know how they keep it up. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      America at least has a tradition of patronage. It works through philanthropic 
      foundations: the Lannan, the MacArthur, the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest, 
      these organisations have helped writers greatly, but not as a matter of 
      government policy. In Australia it's done with the support of all the Australian 
      working people, taken from their tax and given to those who need and deserve 
      it. Writer's grants work out to about a dollar per taxpayer per year. That's 
      not much, is it? You'd think every society could afford that. In the US 
      it's more chancey; as a writer you depend on someone's generosity. <br>

      I'd like to turn to a concern that many writers and critics seem exercised 
      by at present: postmodernism. Do you think a knowledge of postmodern theory 
      is necessary for a contemporary writer? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> No, not really. Of course it's a good thing to be aware of the philosophical 
      currents of the time, particularly when they deal with how art and theory 
      are created and consumed, but it isn't necessary for the art. I mean, it 
      doesn't tell you how to make better art. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i>

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Perhaps architects have to be more aware of it, because architecture 
      is a fashion-driven trade, like interior decorating - could we be rude and 
      call architecture 'exterior decorating'? - and postmodernism is the current 
      fashion. Well, that's not quite true; the geographer Jane M. Jacobs talked 
      to me in Melbourne about the new fashions in building design in Europe, 
      the work of architects like James Stirling, who strongly denies he's a postmodernist, 
      and Norman Foster and Nicholas Grimshaw, who appear to be driving away from 
      postmodern trends towards something else. Their work sounds to me a little 
      like a return to the Bauhaus; back to the future with machine modernism 
      and functional design. But then, that would be a postmodern strategy too. 
      Is postmodernism inescapable? It seems so. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      There's a lot of talk about the borrowing and mixing of styles in postmodernist 
      works. Pastiche, that sort of thing. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Well, architects use <i>pastiche </i>- it sounds like a brand of glue, 
      doesn't it? - then movie-makers use <i>montage, </i>writers and artists 
      and primitive shamans use <i>bricolage </i>- gluing things together. The 
      word 'collage' is from the French word for 'glue'. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"> <br>
      You see it for example in James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, where Joyce borrows 
      forms - the stage play, the music hall, the romantic novelette. In a sense 
      he's parodying them, but he's also using them. And you see it in Eliot's 
      'The Waste Land', and in Pound's <i>Cantos</i>. It's a tactic of classical 
      modernism. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      And postmodernism - what are its tactics? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Well, I think postmodernism is perhaps more a way of viewing and talking 
      about the production and reception of art, and the way art-making strategies 
      developed over the last century, particularly since classical modernism 
      lost steam around the time of the Second World War. I can't see it relating 
      much to a way of making art. Few of those who do make art or literature 
      care much for the theories that prop up postmodernism, and artists and writers 
      are often hostile towards intellectual theories anyway. People who make 
      things usually work with concrete nouns. People who make theories usually 
      work with abstract nouns, and there's no way the two dialect groups can 
      understand each other. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Let's look at Pound, Eliot and Joyce - now they may have known exactly what 
      they were doing in, say 1922, the year in which both Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> 
      and Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i> were published (and Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus</i>, 
      for that matter); after all, they were presenting the signal works of the 
      modernist project in literature to a bewildered audience. They knew what 
      modernism felt like down in the engine-room: they were stoking the boilers. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But did they know where the ship was headed? I doubt they would have been 
      able to understand the terms we use today to talk about modernism. I mean, 
      in some ways Eliot's great critical contribution to the twentieth century 
      was his rehabilitation of John Donne and Virgil, for goodness' sake! Could 
      Picasso have seen Pollock on the horizon in 1922? Or Stravinsky, John Cage? 
      No way. Those people were each more concerned with the making of individual 
      works, and the politics of publishing in the magazines of the time, and 
      how to respond in a 'modern' way to late Victorian and Edwardian art forms, 
      and the need to get a job and pay the rent, and so on. And they didn't know 
      that they were creating the signal works of the modernist project in the 
      way we understand that project now; Eliot was trying to get a poem published, 
      and over in Paris James Joyce was thinking about his next book, and a pair 
      of boots he'd asked someone to send him from England. [ <i> In fact, they 
      were an old pair of brown shoes belonging to Joyce which Ezra Pound had 
      parcelled up with some other clothes and given to T.S.Eliot to pass on to 
      Joyce in Paris in the summer of 1920, according to P. Wyndham Lewis, </i>

      Is there a quality in a work of art that we can call 'postmodern'? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I'm not sure that it's <i>in</i> the work of art - hovering behind 
      it, perhaps, or glowing like an electrical spark in the air, jumping the 
      gap between the work of art and the consumer. I suppose that 'postmodernism' 
      might simply be the quality - almost magical, mostly invisible - that tells 
      the theorists among us that certain artworks or cultural constructions - 
      television game shows, for example - are responding to the postmodern condition 
      of the world; or of the art world, or the world of intellectual discourse. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I guess it's an issue, just how 'responsive' a well-behaved art work should 
      be to the condition of postmodernity; or how 'willingly' a good art work 
      should present itself for scrutiny of this sort, which is often derived 
      from a Marxist analysis of society and culture. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      Does that relate to so-called 'language' poetry? Some of the thinking behind 
      that seems allied to Marxist analysis. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> So-called 'language' poetry seems to me to be a mixture of linguistics, 
      Californian Marxism, Gertrude Stein and French literary theory. Lyn Hejinian 
      said (in a talk in Sydney) that it came out of her generation's responses 
      to the official lies and propaganda the Nixon government used to justify 
      the Vietnam war. It seems that in one sense those young people wanted to 
      purify the language that had been contaminated by their parents' generation. 
      And it developed from that, over a couple of decades, and woke up one day 
      to find itself corralled by academia. It's perhaps the first time a literary 
      movement has been developed by young university-trained critics who have 
      written the creative texts required by the theory they developed. Perhaps 
      that's why some readers find the texts somewhat lacking in the pleasure 
      department. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Some of this theory can be useful when it explores and exposes how value 
      in poetry is constructed by the people who consume it, and then shows how 
      this ideological process is denied and concealed by the consumers. That's 
      interesting. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But a culture's desire for poetry is difficult to analyse in a Marxist sense 
      as a 'commodity'; it functions outside the relations of capital in many 
      important ways, unlike say architecture, which is linked to capital by an 
      intravenous tube with a pump at the other end. And a critique of poetry 
      as 'commodity fetishism' can't say much that's useful about how poetry actually 
      works - how it has functioned since the bronze age. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Critics don't seem to deal well with 'role' in that sense. I'd like to see 
      a theory of poetry that talked not about 'value', or 'voice' or 'stance', 
      but 'role' instead: drawing on Erving Goffman's work in <i>The Presentation 
      of Self in Everyday Life</i>, perhaps. That kind of theory could usefully 
      look at Shakespeare, at Browning's dramatic monologues, at Auden's various 
      roles, at Stevens, at some of Frank O'Hara's games with 'I' and 'you' and 
      role-shifts and reversals. I think it's time we let Gertrude Stein have 
      a rest. <br>

      </i> Back in 1964 the poet Lee Cataldi said I should read Ferdinand de Saussure, 
      the linguist whose lectures in the early years of the century more or less 
      started the fashion for structuralism among French academics. I tried, but 
      I found it too dry and technical, and as far as linguistics went I was more 
      interested in Chomsky, and then in Benjamin Lee Whorf and Sapir, who were 
      on a linguistics course I was doing. They had clear and intriguing things 
      to say about how a culture forces one to see reality in certain ways, ways 
      of viewing things which are relative to different cultures and which are 
      essentially linguistic. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      In my own writing - and in the reading I did to discover how to write - 
      I was interested in exploring European modernism, which believe it or not 
      felt like a daring new thing in Australia back then, and in Freud and Jung, 
      in relativity theory, in movies, in various other new types of poetry. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I would also say, as a minor point, that postmodern writing appeared in 
      Australia in the late sixties and through the seventies as a result of our 
      trying to come to terms with some of the strategies of late classical modernism. 
      In other words, by the time modernism arrived here to any real effect, it 
      had transmuted into postmodernism. In a <i>TLS</i> piece a few years ago, 
      the critic Lawrence Norfolk says that 'Modernism met its match in Australia 
      ...'. He says it was 'A succession of short-lived attempts, never quite 
      a movement.' <img src="floorofheaven.jpg" width=197 height=306 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0 align="right" alt="The Floor of Heaven (cover) ">

      I dislike the expression post-post-modernism, but don't you think in the 
      long narrative poems collected in <i>The Floor of Heaven</i> you're setting 
      up a straightforward construct in terms of dialogue and monologue, and then 
      you're stretching it, making it taut? Is the term 'post-post-modernism' 
      relevant here? And do you think you can be humane, or humanist, and post-post-modernist? 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Well, I suppose <i>The Floor of Heaven</i> could be seen as a post-post-modernist 
      project, but I didn't set out to do that. I just do what I do, and when 
      I turn around and look at it afterwards, that seems to be a category that 
      might fit. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      As for incorporating humane, or humanist values, in contemporary writing 
      - that seems a worthwhile challenge. I think it's always true that writers 
      need to do work that's interesting in itself as craft and art, in terms 
      of where the art has developed to, as well as having something of human 
      worth to give people. You should be able to do both; why settle for less? 
      You only have one chance at it. You need to keep a light touch, though. 
      Humanism has been contaminated by a thousand bad poets who demand that poetry 
      be Deep and Meaningful, the D&amp;M Squad of the Salvation Army, who take 
      moral earnestness as a mark of quality, but humanism can't be blamed for 
      that. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      It's not compulsory, but I think the best artworks give you both a fresh 
      handling of materials, the techniques and themes of the contemporary world, 
      and at the same time they give you a little more - a glimpse of human fate 
      and destiny that the reader can project back into the work. We each have 
      to die, and that's important; and no amount of theory will mediate that.

      Let's talk about <i>The Floor of Heaven</i> for a moment. It's almost like 
      a collection of four novellas, isn't it, adding up to around a hundred and 
      forty pages of blank verse. They're mainly about strong women characters, 
      although there are some interesting men as well. Now despite the language 
      of those poems - those narratives - being somewhat removed from everyday 
      life, it still operates on a humane and familiar level, wouldn't you agree?

      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I wanted the language to be reasonably naturalistic, though perhaps 
      a little feverish. And because it constructs 'believable characters', then 
      I guess it is operating on a level where you can talk about humane values 
      and so forth. Actually those narrative poems owe their style more to Christina 
      Stead's short stories than to anything else, particularly her use of monologue 
      as a narrating device. I was very impressed by her novella <i>Girl From 
      the Beach</i> when I read an extract from it - this was in the mid 1980s 
      - in the Winter-Spring 1967 issue of the <i>Paris Review</i>. It's mainly 
      monologue, that rushes along and carries you with it. Stead was interested 
      in people just as much as she was in literature, whatever that is. More 
      so, I think. <br>

      What about the violence, the extreme emotional states, the tides of passion

      we dealing with melodrama here? <br>

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> (Laughs.) It's funny, some critics have read the poems as critiques 
      or parodies of classical melodrama, if you'd allow the oxymoron. I'm not 
      so sure it's as cynical as that, or as simple as that. I confess the action 
      is sometimes lurid, and the emotional currents rather high-voltage, but 
      I wasn't consciously setting out to parody that style of narrative, really. 
      Perhaps I'm not as subtle a writer as some people think. I wanted to jump 
      into the action and get moving, <i>'in medias res'</i> as the poet Horace 
      says. And the characters, their extreme emotional states - well, I've never 
      been interested in pale, self-questioning nerds like the Bloomsbury set, 
      sitting on the terrace in the twilight sipping cups of tea and talking about 
      spiritual experiences. I like characters with a bit of bite, who have a 
      'rage to live', to quote a Suzanne Pleshette movie title. <br>

      You see, the story is built on spoken monologues, so the people speaking 
      have to have something compelling to say, or the reader is going to lose 
      interest. I used to work in radio - radio plays - and one rule in writing 
      radio goes like this: you have to grab your audience right at the start, 
      and keep them interested. If you lose the listeners in the first five minutes, 
      you've lost them, period. <br>

      thinking of a colour short titled <i>NY, NY</i> back in the sixties, a piece 
      about half an hour long that featured distorted reflections of New York, 
      reflections in hub-caps and rippling pools of water, with a jazz sound-track; 
      and of course there's the fashion photographer Bert Stern's <i>Jazz on a 
      Summer's Day</i>, a bright and 'poetic' documentary of a Newport jazz convention 
      in the late fifties. But film depends, in terms of economics, on audiences 
      of a certain size, and they have an appetite for narrative, and essentially 
      narrative that embeds characters in a plot; a plot that constructs the responses 
      of the characters. So most movies are rather like novels; long and narrative. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I think most contemporary 'lyric' poetry is more like that short film I 
      mentioned, <i>NY, NY</i> - selective, colored, distorted, without a linear 
      time-frame, and with a few small but intense points to make. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Those long narrative poems in <i>The Floor of Heaven</i> are different - 
      They're perhaps more like conventional movies, in terms of scale, duration, 
      narrative approach. You can read most contemporary lyric poems in about 
      five minutes - you get one quick thrill, and that's it - but 'Rain' (one 
      of the narratives in <i>The Floor of Heaven</i>) is forty pages long, and 
      it has characters and a storyline, and scenery - and even a sound-track, 
      if you listen closely. <img src="trainbar.jpg" width=450 height=294 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=1 align="bottom" alt="...meanwhile, in a bar on the Narration Express ... "> 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Film - I love the way the language of film can be so vivid, yet seem so 
      natural. And with the advantages of a sound-track, good-looking actors, 
      makeup, lighting - any poet would be envious of that grip on the audience. 
      Sometimes I think that my poems are my attempts at film. <br>

      &nbsp; <br>
      But then video is soaked with the values of advertising. To make an arresting 
      video clip you have to make it look and sound like a good television commercial. 
      Commercials have the qualities of a successful prostitute. Look at Madonna's

      Looking at the reception of your work generally, how do you feel about the 
      notion that your work is going to be interpreted in a theoretical context, 
      as opposed to the lyrical mode, in which most poets have been examined? 
      Do you see academic-based theoretical analysis as an appropriate way of 
      looking at poetry? <br>

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter:

      about it doesn't matter. It will happen anyway, and that's fine. On the 
      other hand, I think that what I write will test the critic as much as the 
      other way around. So I find that interesting too. And as for lyricism, while 
      I'm emotionally drawn to it, there's so much opportunity for fakery and 
      bullshit in that mode, that it's a good thing to see it tested by theory.

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      With some poets like Yeats, say, there is an over-riding concern with the 
      notion of vision. You on the other hand seem more concerned with the possibilities 
      of language as a thing in itself. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Not really. In my early work I was very interested in the idea of vision. 
      My first book was titled <i>Parallax</i>, a word that relates to camera 
      viewfinders and binocular vision. On a more complex level, language itself 
      constructs the way a person perceives and constructs the patterns in the 
      world around them. Gestalt theory still has important things to say. Language 
      is obviously the crucial factor in a piece of writing, and I've been interested 
      in it from a linguistic point of view, and from a philosophical point of 
      view, and peripherally from an anthropological point of view, because that's 
      what determines your vision, what you can and can't see of the world. I'm 
      interested in language because it's what poems are made out of. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      What about 'vision' as a metaphysical concept? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Well ... I've always had a religious tendency, though I don't usually 
      talk about that much. In my twenties I read widely among a number of religions, 
      and put some years of study and practice into Zen Buddhism. I respect Zen 
      as a philosophical and psychological system, and the general Buddhist theme 
      of compassion seems a good thing, when you look around you. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Wittgenstein said that 'of that which we cannot speak, we must remain silent'. 
      What he didn't realise - apparently he didn't come across any Zen teachers 
      - was that such things do have meaning, are vitally important, and can be 
      communicated. At a certain level, you have to go beyond language. In fact 
      it's the dualistic nature of language that's the problem with the way we 
      perceive the world, which in itself is not dualistic. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      There's an old saying that those who know do not speak, and those who speak 
      do not know. Somehow writing poems about these delicate and paradoxical 
      matters seems not only stupid - logically stupid - but tainted with vanity 
      and bad taste as well. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      Do you think the poem can exist as an object it itself? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Well, yes, of course it does. Look at little children who repeat nursery 
      rhymes. They have no idea what the meaning of 'Humpty Dumpty fell off the 
      wall' is - I think it was originally an English political satire - but they 
      know it sounds good. It's a delight for them. We should keep in mind, I 
      think, that the aim of poetry is delight. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      On the other hand, a poem only has meaning because of the history of the 
      language it's written or spoken in, and the broad culture and the literary 
      traditions of the society it operates in; so on a level of linguistic function, 
      all its meaning is conditional and relative, and changes over time, and 
      with different readers. <br>

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      [The Australian poet] Les Murray is a slightly older colleague of yours. 
      How do you view his work in terms of the way it uses its language? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Oh, Les has a linguistic talent, a real way with words. In his writing 
      I think he tends to take the solidity and denotative abilities of language 
      for granted as a tool he can put to good use. Not for him the modernist 
      doubt and angst of Beckett, say, or <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. He just gets 
      on with the job, describing a landscape, or two farmers talking, or an animal's 
      interior thoughts. In some ways I think of him as having the combined talents 
      of an Edgar Lee Masters and a James Dickie. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Then there's another decorative and riddling way he uses words, rather like 
      Craig Raine's 'Martianism', where you get things displaced into metaphors 
      and made strange, and you have to guess what it is he's describing, like 
      the mystery sound effect in old radio shows. It's an example of what Viktor 
      Shklovsky called <i>ostranenie</i>, a process of deliberate 'enstrangement', 
      of making the ordinary seem strange. It's also related to 'kenning', an 
      ancient Scandinavian poetic device, and quite attractive in small doses. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Readers who like Les's work tend to invest in the general belief that if 
      a writer says a particular thing memorably enough, invoking 'literature' 
      to authenticate the poet's 'voice' and vice versa, then the words take on 
      an almost magical weight, a gravity, that guarantees the broadly moral or 
      religious values underneath the statement. It's that Deep and Meaningful 
      thing. I tend to think with Saussure that words are a little more fragmented 
      and arbitrary than that. And then there's the dangerously circular nature 
      of that 'vice versa'. You can end up authenticating yourself, endlessly, 
      and sounding like a radical clergyman. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But then Les and I are more alike than different. we're both contemporary 
      Australian poets, with Scottish ancestry, from coastal country farms, who 
      both attended Sydney University during the sixties, married during the sixties 
      and had children, studied Arts, failed some subjects and dropped out, and 
      came back a few years later to complete our degrees. Perhaps we were twins, 
      separated at birth. (Laughs.) <br>

      A few years ago I heard a program on <i>Helicon</i> [a weekly arts program 
      on ABC Radio National] on the poet Harry Hooton, a poet who was born in 
      London in 1908, migrated to Australia in 1926 and died in 1961. What did 
      you have to do with that? <br>

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter:

      admire his non-conformist spirit and his bohemian stand. I just wish he'd 
      been a better writer. His ideas were interesting, like many of the ideas 
      of the Sydney 'Push', the intellectual mob he hung around with. In their 
      time in Australia, in the nineteen-forties and fifties, his theories - which 
      were related to Futurism, in a way - were startling. I don't think there 
      was anyone quite like him. But I think he lacked either the gift to write 
      well enough, or the willingness to train himself to do it. <br>

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      You were quite sympathetic though, during the <i>Helicon</i> program. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Well, I felt it was important that what he did be remembered, and I

      Some reviewers have called your early work remote, or cold. Cavafy removed 
      himself from the immediacy of his own life through his use of myth and history. 
      Do you think you've done this in an intellectual way, through language? 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Perhaps I have. Cavafy had to withdraw a little from his material for 
      all sorts of reasons. He was writing at the turn of the century in the city 
      of Alexandria, in Egypt. He was often unable to be frank about what he was 
      discussing - male homosexuality, much of the time - but also I think there 
      was a natural reticence that heightened the intensity of the experiences 
      underneath or behind the poem, and that's what I like about his work. I 
      grew up an only child, on an isolated farm, and I'm rather shy as a result; 
      I can relate to that, that kind of double effect where you say: 'I'm not 
      really affected by these things', and yet the way you say that implies that 
      actually you are. I think you get a stronger response from the reader. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I've always disliked gush. Perhaps in my early work I went too far the other 
      way, so that some of my work ended up sounding cold or cynical; I don't 
      know. I did the best I could. Something I've realised only lately is that 
      every writer does the best she or he can. There's no use saying 'Oh, I wish 
      Graham Greene would stop going on about his Catholic angst', or 'I wish 
      Henry Miller would stop writing about his dick.' They were doing their best. 
      They couldn't do any better. <br>

      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter:

      Whereas a poet like Robert Adamson is totally and utterly involved in the 
      evolution of his poetry and the evolution of his life. They are synonymous.

      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Ah ... well, that's what he says; you can take that or leave it. Have 
      you met Robert Adamson? He's a very complex man. And under-rated as a poet, 
      I feel. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I'd say his life and his poetry are separate things; but I could be wrong. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      For me it depends on the poem. Occasionally I write drafts of poems that 
      are based on linguistic play, and that might turn out to have some interesting 
      material. I develop them a little more, and if I like them I publish them. 
      With some other poems, I find I'm writing about experiences like the ones 
      I've had in my own life that are important to me. And so, some of my poems 
      are deeply personal; while others are quite impersonal. And some - the best, 
      perhaps - are a little of both. It just depends on the individual poem. 
      I write so many different kinds of poems. It must exasperate the critics. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      When I was young I was influenced by T.S.Eliot's theoretical writings as 
      well as his verse. He talked about the removal of the personality from the 
      poem. Frank O'Hara talked about the same thing. O'Hara's poetry is personal, 
      and it has a lovely touch - like the touch of a good pianist - because it 
      is apparently impersonal, and he manages to do that trick of having his 
      cake and eating it too. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      Another tangent. Do you have any admiration for the compression of image? 
      How do you respond to the idea of 'deep imagism', the sort of thing you 
      see for example in the work of the American poets Robert Bly and Galway 
      Kinnell? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I learned a lot from Bly. Poems like 'Awakening', 'Driving toward the 
      Lac Qui Parle River', and 'Sleet Storm on the Merritt Parkway', these are 
      classic works, and immensely seductive: passionate, yet cool; thrilling, 
      yet beautifully articulated. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But I don't know ... they seem to take the concept of the lyrical moment 
      for granted, like Cartier-Bresson's idea of 'the decisive moment' in photography. 
      If a master does it, it seems to be true; and Bly and Cartier-Bresson are 
      masters. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Yet when you analyse that remark of Cartier-Bresson's, there's no theory 
      there at all, just a simple classroom skill. If you're using a camera, of 
      course you wait for the decisive moment - or for the next decisive moment, 
      if you miss the first one; what else would you do? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Whenever I think of Galway Kinnell's audience I think of constructions that 
      are strangely insincere. Not that he is, or that his poetry is: he's a very 
      earnest man. I'm talking about the collective representations created in 
      the space between author and reader, a kind of cultural hologram, created 
      by the desires of the consumers. It seems that a lot of middle-class middle-aged 
      Americans have a belief that if a poem appears to come from an intense and 
      profoundly stirring experience, like fighting to the death with a grizzly 
      bear, then it's a deeply meaningful poem - that D&amp;M stuff again! - which 
      will recreate in themselves a corresponding emotional state. They consume 
      <i>National Geographic</i> magazine or movies like <i>Dances With Wolves</i> 
      for a similar reason: to enjoy a kind of anthropological tourism. But perhaps 
      I'm letting my congenital Australian cynicism corrupt my responses. I like 
      Galway's poetry. He has a great verbal talent, but his work sometimes seems 
      to be acting out a role that fulfils a set of audience expectations that 
      I would find somewhat confining. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      I'd like to focus on poetry by Australian women poets for a while now. Who 
      do you think the major women poets are? What do you feel about the 'development' 
      in women's verse in the last twenty or so years, and within the context 
      of the 'Generation of '68', that large and energetic generation of young 
      Australian poets who began publishing in the late 1960s? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I think perhaps a woman would be best able to do that, but for what 
      it's worth I'll talk about it. To start with, there are heaps of good women 
      poets in Australia, and you can find most of them in the <i>Penguin Book 
      of Australian Women Poets</i>, not to mention the <i>Penguin Book of Modern 
      Australian Poetry</i>, where a third of the contributors are women. A decade 
      ago my wife Lyn and I published with our own hands and with a very helpful 
      printing subsidy from the Literature Board, Gig Elizabeth Ryan's first book, 
      and Susan Hampton's first book. I still like their work; it's vigorous and 
      it's varied. <br>
      <img src="penguin.jpg" width=191 height=295 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0 align="right" alt="Cover of Penguin anthology"> 
      <br>
      Among the other women poets whose work I really enjoy are Judith Wright, 
      Dorothy Hewett, Antigone Kefala, Jennifer Rankin, Lee Cataldi, Joanne Burns, 
      Vicki Viidikas, Pamela Brown, Anna Couani, Jennifer Maiden, Ania Walwicz, 
      Dorothy Porter, Judith Beveridge, Kate Lilley, Meredith Wattison, Lisa Jacobson 
      ... it's a long list, really, and there are many others I could mention. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      As to why there were fewer women poets than men poets among the people whose 
      work developed strongly in the so-called 'Generation of '68', it's hard 
      to say. Those things happened nearly a quarter of a century ago, now. I'm 
      no sociologist, but I have a half-serious theory that the heavy social, 
      cultural and educational pressures through the first half of the century, 
      and especially in the 1950s, produced a generation of young Australian women 
      who saw their role in life as domestic, co-operative, non-competitive, and 
      supportive of men. Australian boys on the other hand were taught to be competitive, 
      individualistic loners, able to forge ahead and put up with years of struggle 
      and obscurity, working on projects which others thought peculiar but which 
      they obstinately gave value to; like [the aeronautical pioneers] Lawrence 
      Hargrave and Kingsford Smith. We put them on the twenty-dollar note. Think 
      of the early explorers who were held up as models in Australian schools: 
      Matthew Flinders, Burke and Wills, Leichhardt; and the movie heroes: Scott 
      of the Antartic (the doomed hero of the first movie I ever saw), Chips Rafferty, 
      John Wayne - stubborn individualists, all of them. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Competitive individualism and stubbornness are the opposite of the qualities 
      people imagine poets are born with - sensitivity and empathy, you know, 
      that blend of Keats and Bambi. But perhaps competitive individualism and 
      stubbornness are the very qualities you need to survive and endure over 
      time in Australia, slogging away at the unrewarded profession of poetry 
      for long enough to get good at it. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Perhaps most young women had too much sense to slog away at poetry. Only 
      a tiny proportion of any generation of writers is going to succeed, and 
      lack of success in that field left a lot of young men miserable, unemployable, 
      and generally strung-out. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Of course the women's movement through the seventies and eighties gave support 
      and direction to a lot of women poets, and you can see the results in the 
      writing; some good, some not, like most writing in any age, but by comparison 
      stronger, more individualistic and better-developed than before. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Though we must remember history. In Australia, as in England and the US, 
      women have always been successful in the field of fiction, in short-story 
      writing and novel writing, and they've done well at that for over a hundred 
      years. In the early 1990s, more than three quarters of Penguin's top thirty 
      best-selling Australian fiction titles were by women. <br>

      Octopus' in the early 1970s. David Malouf, Rodney Hall, and Thomas Shapcott 
      were friends, and all came from Brisbane (or from nearby Ipswich in Tom's 
      case) to Sydney in the 1960s (Tom stayed behind for a few years), and became 
      involved in poetry magazine, newspaper and anthology publishing, reviewing 
      and editing in various powerful and complex ways. Tom even became Director 
      of the Literature Board, though that job gives you more ulcers than power. 
      Some young poets said they had a stranglehold on the new poetry, but in 
      fact they helped many poets find publication, notably Dransfield and Adamson 
      at the start of their careers. They encouraged lots of young people, and 
      what I remember about each of them was their enthusiasm for the work of 
      young writers, and their generosity. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Then there's a contemporary grouping that includes Les Murray, literary 
      editor of <i>Quadrant</i> magazine, set up in 1956 by James McAuley as a 
      means of countering the influence of international communism on intellectual 
      life. It was supported financially by the CIA for many years. The previous 
      literary editor was Vivian Smith, and for many years Vivian and Les Murray 
      were the two poetry readers at Angus & Robertson Publishers, our leading 
      poetry publisher then - they more or less decided who could be published 
      there. Dame Professor Leonie Kramer is on the <i>Quadrant</i> board, and 
      she was Vivian Smith's superior at Sydney University's English Department 
      for many years. She was the chief editor for the Oxford <i>Australian Literary 
      History</i>, for which Vivian Smith wrote the poetry section. And of course 
      Les Murray edited Oxford's major anthology of Australian poetry, and he 
      was also the chief advisor on the modern poetry entries in the first edition 
      of Oxford's <i>Companion to Australian Literature</i>. When Les was editing 
      <i>Poetry Australia</i> magazine in the 1970s, his friend Jamie Grant wrote 
      a few rather ungenerous reviews for the magazine of poets whose work he 
      and Les didn't like. Jamie Grant's poetry has appeared in <i>Quadrant</i> 
      for some twenty years now. With his wife he's the publisher of Isabella 
      Press, which publishes Les Murray's poetry and the poetry of a group of 
      poets who left Angus & Robertson with Les a few years ago, after Les had 
      a disagreement with the new management. Jamie Grant's Isabella Press books 
      are actually published and distributed by Reed/Heinemann, where Jamie Grant's 
      brother Sandy Grant was chief executive for many years. Jamie Grant's wife 
      is Margaret Connolly, and she's Les Murray's literary agent. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      And so it goes, around and around - probably the most complicated set of 
      interrelationships in Australian literary publishing ever, and I suppose 
      some people might call it a clique. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      But as far as I know they're just people who've become friends because they 
      have common likes and dislikes. I'm sure there are other groups of friends 
      like that all over Australia, supporting each other's work - some left wing, 
      some right wing, some radical, some supporting a conservative tradition, 
      some in the middle. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      I think it often goes like this: if a group of people want to publish your 
      next book, They're your friends. If they don't want to publish your next 
      book, They're a clique. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      You mentioned tradition. When people talk about poetry they often focus 
      on shifts in tradition, or style, or form. The formalist debate is strong 
      in the US now. Where does content come into this? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I think that 'content' is an important problem of modern poetics, one 
      that's not talked about much. Is the desire for content essentially middle 
      class? Can you get rid of it and still have literature? I think Gertrude 
      Stein tackled it, I think Ashbery was addressing it in a different way in 
      his early book <i>The Tennis Court Oath</i>. That's the book so many people, 
      including me, find hard to read, but that's the point in some ways. You 
      could say that the Iowa Writing School poets take it for granted that there's 
      no such problem: as a poet, it's your job to write about the Deep and Meaningful 
      stuff - anguished relationships, deeply moving climatic conditions, momentous 
      landscapes, small but perfectly formed epiphanies of the bourgeois life. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      The so-called 'language' poets take the problem as their main focus - what 
      actual quality of language makes this group of words a 'poem', this a clever 
      concoction, and this a valueless piece of trash? What happens if we turn 
      them inside out, or mash them up together? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Form and content are traditionally supposed to work together to create meaning; 
      but we're now beginning to see that meaning is constructed by the reader 
      as much as by the writer, and that it's constructed by the society, and 
      by the complicated and powerful traditions of writing, editing, publishing 
      and marketing, as much as by the individual reader. And then there are the 
      writing schools! <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      For a year or so I was interested in a text-generation computer program 
      which reconstructs a piece of text from any sample you might care to feed 
      into it, using a statistical analysis of letter-group frequency arrays. 
      It's too technical to explain here, but the program can imitate the texture 
      of a particular writer's work, without imitating the meaning in any way, 
      by reconstructing a text with the typical sequence of letters the writer 
      tends to employ. The content is - well, there isn't any, it's a blank, because 
      nobody meant any of it; nobody wrote it. The computer merely assembled it. 
      So you can have style - style so pure you could say it's been sterilised 
      - uncontaminated by any considerations of content. And yet as a reader you're 
      constantly scanning for meaning, for content. That's what makes writing 
      readable. Fascinating. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      What about the long narrative poems that make up <i>The Floor of Heaven</i>? 
      Did they begin as computer experiments? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Oh, no, quite the opposite. I wrote them as straightforward narratives. 
      In fact my adventures with narrative verse began as prose, as drafts for 
      a chapter of a novel which I never went on with. I seem to do that every 
      five or ten years. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      You completed <i>Under Berlin</i> in 1988. What did you work on after that? 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I worked on the long narrative poems for about five years, I guess. 
      At the same time I was writing quote normal unquote poems from time to time. 
      I compiled them into the collection <i>At The Florida</i>, which appeared 
      in late 1993. <br>
      <img src="atf.jpg" width=200 height=285 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0 align="right" alt="cover of At The Florida"> 
      <br>
      It contains a mixture of things, including a sequence of thirty "haibun", 
      which are poems each about a page long. I was looking for a new form, trying 
      to wade out of the tar-pit of habit, at the same time as I was looking for 
      a way of avoiding the patterns of meaning that the forms of verse themselves 
      impose on a piece of writing. The "haibun" was developed in seventeenth-century 
      Japan, and consists of prose and verse mixed; traditionally a short prose 
      passage is followed by a haiku. I have inverted and re-engineered the form 
      for my own purposes, settling on a twenty-line stanza of free verse, followed 
      by a paragraph of prose up to half a page long. One of the haibun - 'The 
      Duck Abandons Hollywood' - actually started out as Wordsworth's 'Daffodils', 
      would you believe. I put it through the wringer and Wordsworth's line 'a 
      poet could not but be gay' came out as 'a troubadour could not but be / 
      bisexual' which says something about how times have changed, if nothing 
      else. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Then there are fifty or so pages of various pieces. Oh, and two rather long 
      poems in Sapphics, one in loose and one in regular Sapphics. One has appeared 
      in the <i>Paris Review</i> and one in <i>Parnassus: Poetry in Review</i>. 
      Sapphics are interesting to work on; it's a particularly obstinate form 
      in English though no doubt it works fine in classical Greek. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      Semantically, how do you view language structure in your poetry? I'm particularly 
      interested in the new, shorter forms you are using and how this implicates 
      content in a theoretical context. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> With modern poetry there's always a tension between the older formal 
      structures - it's amazing how much energy the sonnet and the iambic pentameter 
      still have in English, and alliteration is perennially energetic - and newer 
      looser structures, particularly demotic and colloquial forms. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      With my 'haibun' poems, I guess a reader would find a simple tension between 
      the twenty lines of free verse which make up the first stanza, and the prose 
      that makes up the second. They have different rhythms, different densities, 
      and in a sequence of them, you might find a tightening and loosening effect 
      as the verse and the prose alternated, like waves on the ocean. Then in 
      those poems there's a different tension, between varying kinds of content: 
      old-fashioned content on the one hand, where meaning lies in description 
      or argument or tone, and an apparent denial of content on the other, where 
      meaning seems to be contradicted, disrupted, fragmented and eventually denied. 
      But I guess that's not answering your question very well. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      As well as writing your own poetry, you've also done a lot of other work 
      in the field of anthologising, compiling books and radio programs ... <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> I worked as a radio producer with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 
      at various times over the years, producing programs on history, archaeology, 
      a documentary on carnival sideshow workers, interviews with poets and critics, 
      and radio anthologies of poetry from Sir Thomas Malory to Frank O'Hara and 
      John Ashbery. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      The latest print project I'm excited about is the <i>Penguin Book of Modern 
      Australian Poetry</i>, which adds up to nearly five hundred pages. I worked 
      on that with Philip Mead as my co-editor for two or three years, and it's 
      been published now, to mixed reviews. I think its most interesting feature 
      for the reader is the inclusion of all the poems of 'Ern Malley', a hoax 
      figure concocted by two young conservative poets in the 1940s as an attack 
      on the pretensions of the experimentalist and Apocalyptic schools in Australian 
      verse. That book has been published in the UK as the <i>Bloodaxe Book of 
      Modern Australian Poetry</i>. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i> 
      You've been involved in two other anthologies as well, <i>The New Australian 
      Poetry</i> in 1979, and <i>The Tin Wash Dish</i> for ABC Books in 1989. 
      What are your views on the poet as anthologiser? <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter: 
      </i> Well, for a start, anthologies are always acts of criticism, and that's 
      interesting, because criticism at its best is a dialogue, a way of talking 
      about the art form that invites responses. The word 'anthology' comes from 
      the Greek, and means a collection of flowers; the corollary is that you 
      leave the weeds to wither. Sometimes readers need a little help in picking 
      the flowers and leaving the weeds aside. (I'm joking.) <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Anthologies also preserve poems. So many poems simply disappear into the 
      maw of the past, and anthologies are perhaps the best way of preserving 
      them for future generations. We'd have no Callimachus and no Sappho if other 
      people hadn't anthologised, quoted and argued about their work. Their own 
      collections didn't survive. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Of course when you have a poet anthologising other poets, there are dangers. 
      For example in Robert Gray and Geoffrey Lehmann's anthology <i>The Younger 
      Australian Poets</i>, the three poets with many more pages than anyone else 
      were Les Murray and the two editors. But I don't think anyone was particularly 
      worried about that. I suppose there's a danger that the poet will be partial 
      to her or his friends, or will exclude someone she or he personally dislikes; 
      but any honest person will try hard not to do those things. A critic or 
      an academic scholar is just as apt to be biased in any case; look at <i>The 
      Oxford Anthology of Australian Literature</i>. That was supposedly a work 
      of academic scholarship, balanced and comprehensive, and it turned out to 
      be a rather inadequate collection in some areas, to put it politely, and 
      sank without trace. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000099"size="3"> <i>John Kinsella: </i>You've 
      started up an Internet magazine, in mid-1997. How did <b>Jacket magazine</b>

      </font><font face="Georgia" color="#000000" black size="3"><i>John Tranter:</i> 
      I saw that the Internet at one stroke does away with the two main problems 
      of literary magazines - the cost of manufacture, and how to reach your audience. 
      Jacket is a quarterly, and I guess in print form each issue would be over 
      a hundred pages long. It has dozens of full colour photos and pieces of 
      art work. To print a thousand copies of a single issue would cost around 
      ten thousand dollars, and involve half a dozen highly skilled people - typsetter, 
      proof-reader, designer, platemaker, printer, binder, and so on. To ship 
      it around the world and warehouse it in New York, San Francisco and London 
      would cost even more. Yet the Internet does all that virtually for free. 
      Well, for say a few thousand dollars. Well, once you have a computer and 
      scanner and so forth, and the skills. It's not that difficult. <br>

      but because there's no sense in restricting good writing to one set of national

      early 1992, visiting the United States for some ten weeks. I had a residency 
      at Rollins College, a quiet little college in Florida, and I did some readings 
      in Chicago and San Francisco, and attended a conference of the American 
      Association for Australian Literary Studies in Eugene, Oregon, where I gave 
      a talk and a reading from the Penguin anthology. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      In 1993 I was asked to talk at a conference on Australian radio features 
      in Paris organised by the Australian radio features maker Kaye Mortley, 
      a very gifted artist. While I was there I did a reading in the Village Voice 
      bookshop in Paris - a tiny place, crowded like a can full of sardines, a 
      lot of fun. And I travelled to England and the US in 1994, and again in 
      1996 and 1997. <br>

      You can learn so much from another culture, mainly about your attitude to 
      your life, to your work, and to other people. And to your own culture, of 
      course. You don't notice those things if you stay at home. You learn that 
      these things are relative and conditional. It can give you a shock to see 
      Australia through French eyes, say. To the French, style is the most important 
      thing. The average French official would rather die than be seen in public 
      in grubby gym shoes, denim jeans, and a tweed jacket. And then, the average 
      French intellectual would rather die than be seen in a business suit. For 
      them, denim is fine, but runners are not. They're so tense! And their books 
      of poetry have to look just so - no illustrations on the cover, just print, 
      centred, and only in red and black ink, on cream board. I was amused to 
      see that the menu at the Caf&eacute; du Commerce in Paris is typeset and 
      designed to look exactly like a book of French poetry. But then the French 
      are locked into the concept of proper manners, it's like a straightjacket. 
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      And the States ... I like the energy of the US, and the emphasis on individual 
      freedom, but that American worship of work and success has a dark side, 
      like capitalism itself, which makes a poor and malleable working class an 
      essential part of the system. But so many of the American working poor want 
      it that way - they want the system just like that, because it gives them 
      a chance to be a success. Or so they think. I like the States, but I don't 
      think I could live there for long. <br>

      I miss my family, with all that travelling. And the distances are hard to 
      believe. It can take more than 24 hours to fly from Sydney to New York,

      and they usually have a very nice red <a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"> wine. </a>
