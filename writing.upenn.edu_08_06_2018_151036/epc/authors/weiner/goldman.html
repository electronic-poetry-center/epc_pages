      <P align=justify>In August of 1972, Hannah Weiner, an accomplished and 
      highly politicized performance artist and poet, began to receive a 
      remarkable form of "dictation."<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT1" 
      name=REF1>1</A></SUP> Printed words of all sizes bombarded Weiner; she saw 
      these words in the air, on every available surface, on people, on the page 
      before she wrote them, and on her forehead from within. Weiner called her 
      "psychic" ability to see words "clairvoyance." She developed a mode of 
      poetic writing, "clair-style," that incorporated words and phrases 
      clairvoyantly seen, eventually composing through these seen elements 
      exclusively. In such groundbreaking works as <I>Clairvoyant Journal</I> 
      (1978<I>), LITTLE BOOKS/INDIANS</I> (1980), <I>Sixteen</I> (1983), 
      <I>Spoke</I> (1984), and <I>silent teachers remembered sequel</I> (1994), 
      Weiner did not so much experiment with existing literary models to 
      document the experience of clairvoyance as she created a number of 
      startlingly raw and enormously complex poetic forms, becoming a heroic 
      figure at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery in 
      Manhattan and in the bicoastal school of Language writing. 
      <P align=justify>Weiner let no representation of herself circulate that 
      did not take her status as a clairvoyant into account, as, for instance, 
      her introduction <B>[End Page 121]</B> to <I>Nijole's House</I> (1981) 
      demonstrates: "ALL WORDS BELIEVE IT SEEN / I ams a clairvoyant" 
      (3).<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT2" 
      name=REF2>2</A></SUP> To read Weiner's poetry is thus to confront her 
      claim to clairvoyance, which makes the critical reception of her work an 
      incredibly complicated matter: her emphatic experiential claims and the 
      terms on which she makes them at once legitimate her poetry a priori as 
      testimony and overtly perform as a persuasive strategy within what are 
      extremely self-consciously literary works. Either set of terms requires 
      that we read clairvoyance other than as a symptom of schizophrenia, an 
      illness with which Weiner had been diagnosed.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT3" 
      name=REF3>3</A></SUP> 
      <P align=justify>I want to suggest, however, that in naming the phenomena 
      by which words were given to her to be seen "clairvoyance," Weiner alerts 
      us to the peculiar status of her texts without allowing us to medicalize 
      and dismiss them. For her poetry, arriving from elsewhere in ordinary 
      language, can only become deviant if we decide to make it so from the 
      outset. Indeed, Weiner creates not only an enabling, but a strikingly 
      innovative and important position from which to write: she engages the 
      occultations entailed by linguistic abstraction and signals that she is 
      enabled to do so through a banalized version of the occult. However 
      nonvolitional, clairvoyance is a technique for estranging the normalcy 
      that mystifies us. And Weiner's tactic of reverse discourse, one that 
      appears to trade the blindness of a delegitimized epistemological position 
      for the insight of an idealized and rarefied psychic state, also opens 
      onto paradoxes of reading and writing that her radical, language-centered 
      poetics confronts. 
      <P align=justify>As testimony, clairvoyance does not avow the transparency 
      of its medium, but rather makes the coercion of mediation evident. Openly 
      declaring her solicitation of belief through a trope only 
      <I>figuratively</I> removed beyond belief, Weiner exposes belief itself as 
      the strange but mundane <I>sine qua non</I> of reading. Her strategy 
      illuminates writing's demands on us as it gainsays a credibility it has 
      already hooked in the very act of soliciting credibility. Straining 
      against the transcendental quality of language even as she points to it as 
      a foregone conclusion, Weiner not only disrupts the normative transparency 
      of what is to be read but also erodes the normative rationality of the 
      figure who reads. 
      <P align=justify>For Weiner emphasized that she was not the frictionless 
      vehicle for messages from another scene, but rather the recipient of 
      language that formally and thematically implicated its resistance to 
      meaning. This seen language also revealed that the very recognition of 
      language as such subjects us to a meaning that can neither be averred nor 
      denied. An exteriorized, nonintentional form of writing, the seen words 
      not only <B>[End Page 122]</B> provided a unique means of encountering 
      language as an indeterminate, opaque materiality that we ourselves enliven 
      with belief, but also as a form of mediation that announced itself as 
      being curiously existentially indefinite, both there and not there. Thus, 
      even as she anchored these phenomena in her cognitive experience, 
      clairvoyance was for Weiner not a traffic with the spirit, but a near miss 
      with the letter. Reflexively signifying on clairvoyance as "quaint phrase" 
      or sedimented term, Weiner turned this familiar figure of heightened 
      vision against itself. 
      <P align=justify>In fact, the reversals of Weiner's discursive practice 
      take place on a number of levels, constantly spoiling assumptions <I>about 
      and built into</I> language, yet conscious that our escape from these 
      assumptions is comprised and compromised by language itself. In taking the 
      unusual dictation of clairvoyance, Weiner inverts the apostrophe of lyric 
      poetry and externalizes poetic agency, locating it in mediation. Seeing 
      words clairvoyantly illustrates the mediating tension in language that 
      plays out in syntactical structures, disciplinary mechanisms that echo 
      institutional relationships. Further, rather than performing as a 
      privileged, gendered proximity to authentic knowledge or as a vitiation of 
      a gendered position of knowledge, as it has done traditionally, 
      clairvoyance instead functions as a reflexive figure about figures of 
      knowledge. Weiner dissects a grammar of epistemology that presupposes and 
      incorporates differences as differentials in power. 
      <P align=justify>Vigilant in denaturalizing her technology of 
      representation, Weiner turns clairvoyance to political use, rendering 
      structural and thus necessarily social inequities historically specific. 
      As the singular witness to clairvoyant phenomena, she is poignantly aware 
      that her testimony can only appear in a recognizable and overdetermined 
      form.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT4" 
      name=REF4>4</A></SUP> For Weiner, this hyper-attentiveness to 
      overdetermination resonates most strongly with the political predicament 
      of Native Americans, whose difficulties in achieving adequate political 
      representation demonstrate the limitations of politics and the need for an 
      ethical relation to difference.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT5" 
      name=REF5>5</A></SUP> Weiner was an ardent proponent of the American 
      Indian Movement, but she found, in a sense parallel to her own situation, 
      that to be a witness <I>for</I> is also to be a witness <I>against</I>: 
      simply to use an officially recognized language is already to be 
      implicated in the structures of power, to exploit alterity as it is 
      rendered recognizable. Weiner puts the paralogical or oblique insight she 
      gains from clairvoyance to work in her nonclairvoyant writings as well, 
      commenting on the deep and seemingly unavoidable violence in any 
      representational framework. <B>[End Page 123]</B> 
      <P align=justify>In refusing clairvoyance a logic of presence or direct 
      reference, Weiner forces this trope to diverge from its long history of 
      essentializing feminization and racial exoticism.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT6" 
      name=REF6>6</A></SUP> Moreover, in her later works, she reflexively 
      metaphorizes clairvoyance as a mode of accessing a subjunctive history, a 
      foreclosed potentiality, of the exploited.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT7" 
      name=REF7>7</A></SUP> Weiner was eventually to call clairvoyance "silent 
      teaching," a name that signals a figurative reversal of the textual field, 
      impossibly divesting her writing of any appropriation of force. Her work 
      thus looks over its shoulder towards a historical materiality of the 
      signifier, an ethical relation to alterity that would be this alternately 
      meaningful silence. 
      <P align=justify>
      <H3 align=left><!--_a-head-->Poem As Code <!--_/a-head--></H3>
      <P align=justify>From the moment she took up writing, as Weiner related to 
      Bernstein in a 1995 interview, it was never a matter of self-expression, 
      but a means of displacing the self. She began to write poetry in 1963, and 
      upon receiving a scholarship to the New School for Social Research, she 
      took writing classes with Kenneth Koch and Bill Berkson, although, as 
      Weiner notes, she "could not write New York School poetry" 
      (<I>LINEbreak</I>).<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT8" 
      name=REF8>8</A></SUP> Weiner recalls, in fact, that she felt compelled to 
      work with found texts (a discovery she made through her association with 
      "talk-poet" David Antin).<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT9" 
      name=REF9>9</A></SUP> Weiner's <I>Code Poems</I>, a compilation of poems 
      and performance pieces written in the mid-1960s, is one such result of 
      having encountered a sufficiently alienated form of language with which to 
      compose. The texts in <I>Code Poems</I> are based on a synthetic, 
      nineteenth-century set of given messages comprising the <I>International 
      Code of Signals for the Use of All Nations</I>, "a visual signal system 
      for ships at sea" (3). <I>Code Poems</I> should be considered a landmark 
      collection in the American avant-garde for a number of reasons. As Jackson 
      Mac Low writes, "Weiner's <I>Code Poems</I> are notably original. Outside 
      of a small group of aleatoric poems I made <I>c.</I> 1963 . . . I know of 
      no other code-book poems written in the 1960s. I also know that Weiner, 
      when composing hers, knew nothing of mine: I have transcribed none of them 
      from my notebooks" (97).<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT10" 
      name=REF10>10</A></SUP> The significance of her poetic experiment lies not 
      only in the novelty of employing this medium, but in the way she tests the 
      limits of the material to comment on language. John Perreault observes 
      that Weiner was "asking certain questions before it was fashionable to ask 
      them. Is language a code? Is poetry a code? Can you use one code to 
      describe another code? Can personal expression be avoided?" (8). <I>Code 
      Poems</I> makes the compelling case that <B>[End Page 124]</B> the 
      official messages encrypted in the code harbor secrets hidden only from 
      themselves as self-identical: within them lie communiqués of an alternate 
      totality, heterogeneous and coherent. 
      <P align=justify>Devised to facilitate communication between parties 
      possibly unknown to each other aboard separate ships in the middle of the 
      ocean, the code delivers the given messages in the <I>International Code 
      of Signals</I> volume by reducing the message content to letter-strings. 
      These strings of one, two, three, and four letters represent 
      sentence-length messages ("qna All precautions have been taken"), which 
      are often punctuated by blanks ("zmd Your zeal has been particularly noted 
      by __________"), interrogative tags ("qhr Why?"), common nouns ("iog 
      cheese"), modifying phrases ("kov too dear"), and even prepositions ("qgt 
      on"). Individual units of code maintain a one-to-one correspondence with a 
      message content. When the code was first in use in the mid-nineteenth 
      century, the letter-strings were conveyed through a set of hoisted 
      alphabet flags, with each flag standing in for a letter of the alphabet. 
      Later, an answering pennant, as well as hoisting protocols for use with 
      the original letter-flags, were added to signal the kind of information 
      contained in a phrase (i.e., to signal a general state of distress, to 
      designate giving a geographical location, etc.). 
      <P align=justify>Eventually, the messages represented by letter-strings, 
      as well as content protocols, were conveyed by a number of visual and 
      sound media, as Weiner notes in her introduction to the book: "Visual 
      signaling is any method of above water communication, the transmission of 
      which is capable of being seen (alphabet flags, semaphore flags, Morse 
      [code through] flashing light). Sound signaling is any method of sending 
      Morse signals by means of siren, whistle, foghorn, bell or any other sound 
      apparatus" (3). Although each medium was contrived to convey independently 
      the sum total of encoded messages, Weiner made use of both visual and 
      sonic media in performance. At the Central Park Poetry Events of 1968, 
      code poems were "performed with the aid of the U.S. Coast guard, using 
      alphabet flag hoists, semaphore signalmen, flashing light signals, 
      megaphones, [and] flares" (3).<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT11" 
      name=REF11>11</A></SUP> Every single element of the poems, including their 
      titles, is composed of messages taken verbatim from the code volume. In 
      book format, the code units appear alongside the messages; some pieces are 
      also accompanied by their semaphore and letter flag visual equivalents. 
      <P align=justify>Weiner elsewhere intimates that her code poems challenge 
      lyric conventions because they borrow the two-voice statement and <B>[End 
      Page 125]</B> response form "natural" to the code ("Mostly" 59). (She at 
      times stretches this by introducing more than two voices.) Her poetic 
      experiment also illustrates and contests the structuralist premises on 
      which the code is based. Weiner plays with the code as a purely synthetic 
      system in which all signs are equally unmotivated and whose transcendental 
      meaning is naturalized by convention and reinforced by social contract, 
      condensed and literalized as the set of possible messages in the code 
      book. Weiner emphasizes the dialectical engagement between the abstract 
      "taxonomic" or lexical function of the code and the arena of its 
      articulation. Untethering the naturalized relations between signifiers and 
      signifieds, she alters the message content by <I>performing</I> the code 
      outside of the seafaring context, using antiquated editions of it, and 
      employing media in excess of what is necessary for conveying the given 
      content. Weiner uses the code's systemic purity to alienate the media of 
      communication rather than to reinforce their transparency or clarity; this 
      spectacular distancing, a privileging of the signifier, produces an 
      alternative social value and crystallizes an oppositional community. 
      <P align=justify>As the code poems demonstrate, connotative effects, 
      whereby, to use Barthes's terms, the code refers to another code, may 
      establish the main meaning of any utterance. In "rj Romeo and Juliet," 
      Weiner builds a conversation not only more elaborate than those likely 
      imagined by the 1855 "committee set up by the British board of trade," but 
      also given to flirtation: "jg Romeo: I wish to have personal communication 
      with you / ij Juliet: Unless your communication is very important, I must 
      be excused / jm Mike: Stranger is suspicious / myx Romeo: Fine day / ebl 
      Juliet: I beg to be excused / pcf Romeo: The ice is so solid I cannot 
      break through; send help" (8). In addition to a surprising capacity to 
      instigate romance, the code contains, as Weiner reveals, latent 
      Shakespearean possibilities. Bending the code's rules to comic effect, she 
      uses the metalinguistic names of the letter-flags--the "r" and "j" flags 
      are actually called "Romeo" and "Juliet" in the manual--as character 
      names; at moments, these flag names also become message content ("tmv 
      Shall I have the pleasure to or of / f Foxtrot" [9]). While the code 
      scripts would seem to limit the kinds of information that would be 
      communicable, connotation stretches these limits in ways that the fanciful 
      names of the flags themselves suggest. 
      <P align=justify>The poems also elaborate features of reiterative 
      absurdity in the code, as is the case with "tqa possible-ity": 
      <P align=justify>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract--><I>tqb I doubt if it is possible</I> 
        <BR><I>frw&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barely possible</I> <B>[End Page

        possible</I> <BR><I>fbo As soon as possible (26)</I> 
      <!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify>The text not only exposes certain redundancies within the 
      signal book (after all, what are the salient differences among "fbg," 
      "fai," and "fbo," even if one is not establishing communications under 
      difficult conditions?), but also the proclivity of the code to mimic 
      natural language. The similarities between the letter-strings show that 
      while these arbitrary signifiers do not contain roots exactly, "an analogy 
      in their composition" still obtains (Barthes, "Elements" 51). In thus 
      forcing the code to ridicule itself, Weiner plainly demonstrates another 
      stratum of "possible-ity" it does not officially recognize. 
      <P align=justify>A certain arbitrariness in terms of the extreme variation 
      in degrees of completeness of the code's units is also foregrounded by the 
      poems. Weiner uses code units employing pronouns and other deictics, which 
      require additional contextual completion, as full responses and sabotages 
      particularly vulnerable metalinguistic code phrases, as occurs in "bvz 
      it": "bnv It will do / bix Will it be? / bou Will it do? / cqg What or 
      which is it? / cdy Its-self (see also he, she, it or person-s or thing-s 
      indicated)" (25). Weiner purposely leaves messages containing blanks 
      blank, emphasizing structure over content, as well as soliciting the 
      reader's (or listener's) active engagement in the construction of the 
      piece. Referentless as many of the messages are, they may also produce an 
      effect of extreme constraint, as with "edq Any Chance of War":

      what several of the code poems achieve, given that they go beyond leveling 
      or neutralizing gender (if such leveling can really be possible) to 
      undermine the norms of meaning the code would prescribe, precisely through 
      the strategic deployment of gendered terms.<SUP><A

      gendering of "pirate," ridicules the vestigial and haphazard quality of 
      gender attribution to objects in English (as with the feminization of 
      ship), and performs a confounding slippage in reference--from invader to 
      craft--that grammatical divisions like gender supposedly function to 
      prevent: "cjd I was plundered by a pirate / cjf Describe the pirate / cjn 
      She is armed / cjp How is she armed? / cjs She has long guns / cjw I have 
      no long guns / bld I am a complete wreck" (17). Obviously thrown into the 
      bargain are Weiner's plays on warfare's phallic connotations, which the 
      code cannot factor out of its units. Gender becomes a code for code and 
      additionally a code for the intrinsic failure of code to carry a stable 
      meaning: gender is an error message. Weiner's code poem experiments 
      subvert the uniformity of generalized positions of specular understanding. 
      They expose the incomplete maintenance of delineations between names, 
      ordinary language, and metalinguistic functions in language, illustrating 
      this slippage in levels of discourse most convincingly when using gender 
      as an axis through which a syntactic principle inadvertently becomes 
      thematic. Recuperating this slippage, Weiner revolutionizes the otherwise 
      context-bound and antiquated code by creating a new context <B>[End Page 
      128]</B> of value in which the messages express content not originally 
      "intended" by the system, a failure ultimately productive for an 
      oppositional polity. Clairvoyance was to extend and alter Weiner's 
      experimental inquiries significantly, leading away from this totalizing 
      promise.

      obliquely, Weiner's extremely lively social-cultural life: she was active 
      in New York's experimental performance, writing, art, and music scenes; 
      she also participated in several streams of Eastern religion whose 
      teachers had relocated to Manhattan in the early 1970s.<SUP><A

      in these communities functions as a backdrop to the unusual day-to-day 
      experience occasioning and informing the work: seeing words. But what, 
      after all, is unusual in this? As Charles Bernstein begins a review of the 
      journal: "We all see words" (284). 
      <P align=justify>I In experiencing clairvoyance, Weiner saw fragments of 
        printed text projected onto the world, even onto other literal texts, 
        by "the other part of the mind" ("Mostly" 55), words simultaneously <I>there</I> 
        and <I>not there</I>: "<I>Sometimes a master</I> can help me change that 
        energy back to another center, or I / just have to be told it's not realistilc, 
        <I>men</I> SHUT UP" (<I>Clairvoyant</I> 7). The form and content of these 
        phrases were such as to give Weiner not a glimmer, but a sustained sense 
        that <I>words see us</I>--that we are spoken by language. Despite or perhaps 
        because of the apparent fragmentariness of its phrases and the uneven 
        visuality of their arrangement (see <A

      name=REF15>15</A></SUP> Weiner achieves this continuity through the formal 
        rigor with which she records having her slightest gesture and thought 
        registered and pronounced upon from without by seen words as she responds, 
        records her responses, and records recording her responses to this peculiarly 
        interactive form of surveillance: "FIGURE IT OUT WONDER why they CONNECTICUT 
        use an / <I>dont go out</I> / ' ' when its UPPER CASE YOU have to shift 
        and dont when it's lower case and <I>I / hate you sensitive</I>" (7).

      name=REF16>16</A></SUP> Weiner documents what is essentially a phenomenon 
      of mediation that announces it mediates nothing but mediation itself. The 
      "mediated mediation" of clairvoyance works in two ways: "seen" words not 
      only call attention to, and thus displace, their own opacity, but they 
      also remark on their own ambiguous status as "presences" (since "seen" 
      words are clairvoyantly <I>seen</I>, their appearance is existentially 
      indefinite). Further, Weiner inscribes herself within the work as a 
      principle of misrecognition, whereby language is irreducibly experienced 
      as meaning. She thus prevents the journal from affecting the self-edifying 
      commutability that Paul de Man identifies as an autobiographical 
      function.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT17" 
      name=REF17>17</A></SUP> Ostentatiously adrift from their normal 
      existential parameters, words no longer promise that they will do what we 
      want them to do, whether we mean to limit them to instrumental, 
      informational, or representational functions. They propose instead that we 
      may do only what they, as a vehemently exteriorized guarantee of meaning, 
      desire: "Is OK COME a / reverse? GET ANXIOUS JOIN is that WHY 
      <I>anxious</I> The words tell you to do / things you don't feel certain 
      about doing" (57). Aided by clairvoyance, Weiner writes between these two 
      limits, transcribing a dictation that (re)marks a position where <B>[End 
      Page 130]</B> the authority-effect of meaning fails (words existing where 
      they do not exist), even as she also takes--and records herself 
      taking--that dictation at its word, allowing it to assume a literal and 
      objective form. As Weiner's documentation of her own behavior suggests, 
      the authority-effect is ineradicable; it continues to operate whether we 
      perceive ourselves as possessors of that authority or not. What Weiner 
      records, in fact, is the unendurable yet enduring contradiction that we 
      believe in this authority even as we may be caught between our failure to 
      appropriate it and language's ultimate imperviousness to it. 
      <P align=justify>In this sense, if difference or meaning is always already 
      in effect, there is an illusion of a rule or principle giving rise to and 
      governing it. As Weiner's experience reveals, what is presupposed by any 
      meaning is the extra-logical criterion of its possibility, belief--or what 
      Weiner calls "pre thought thinking" (4). It is notable that the 
      relationship between opacity and discipline often falls out of the 
      equation entirely in discussions of this quasi judgment, largely because 
      belief is assumed to take place within an equational, mutualizing 
      structure. Of persuasion, singularly but ineludibly coercive, and our 
      susceptibility to and dependency upon it, Mikkel Borsch-Jacobsen writes, 
      "[Suggestion] does not communicate a message . . . it communicates a state 
      of faith . . . that is to say, both a receptivity to the message and an 
      identification with the emitter. . . . The listener completely 
      appropriates for himself this discourse of the other; hence also its 
      contaminating, contagious power" (66-67). The first entry of 
      <I>Clairvoyant Journal</I>, in fact, replays this scenario ironically: 
      "Bernadette's MAYER EXPERIMENTS this book is mind con- / trolled the WALK 
      <I>Bernadette</I> language <I>ex communicate her words so through it</I> / 
      goes through" (4). As Weiner remarks, her own work ("this book"), as 
      writing, is susceptible to "mind control," and upon receiving and thus 
      always already using language, it appropriates this domain; Mayer's 
      "Experiments," in turn, are excommunicated in communication.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT18" 
      name=REF18>18</A></SUP> According to Borsch-Jacobsen's logic, because we 
      give authority through belief, we simultaneously gain it, in effect 
      transferring to our own account a credibility, an epistemological figure, 
      not proper to us, because belief offers this promissory note. We come into 
      being "contagiously," cognizable because recognizable, always already 
      persuaded to be persuadable and in turn becoming persuasive. This scenario 
      of mimicry, in which possession/appropriation is conditioned by 
      possession/suggestibility, thus rather suspiciously mimics the more 
      traditional cognate of clairvoyance. Weiner's comment on the normative 
      scene of writing presses this point: if <B>[End Page 131]</B> we assume 
      language's transparency, "<I>so through it</I> / goes through," we are 
      enspirited and obedient, "WALK," but because the hypnosis of normalcy is 
      double-edged, it allows us both to borrow and to obscure our lease on 
      authority. Self-powered, and not mind-controlled, we walk. 
      <P align=justify>Perhaps it is because belief is persistently narrativized 
      within a structure of entitling equivalence that the metalepsis, the 
      prehistory of reversal, through which we perceive ourselves as the 
      originary causes of our actions and the sources of our words, is so 
      intensely tenacious. As Weiner explains: "Why didn't <I>call Nijole</I> 
      learn that almost / everything that comes from PEOPLE is a <I>spank</I> 
      reverse CANCEL appears over reverse" (5). Instead of our seeing this 
      reversal, "CANCEL appears over" it (and thus no spanking). The way to this 
      cancellation is paved by the pronoun "I," as Benveniste postulates: 
      "Language is so organized that it permits each speaker to appropriate to 
      himself an entire language by designating himself as <I>I</I>" (226). 
      Weiner explains that the successful subsumption of this distinctly 
      otherwise-clairvoyant "I"--one that sees clearly, its language 
      transparent--involves being seen and seeing oneself: "You wonder if Rhys 
      saw a big Hannah when you saw a little Rhys? / Once he saw you get larger 
      then he got larger <I>20 feet</I> YOU GET IT" (19). The initial 
      distortion, as Weiner points out, involves a continual juggling act, a 
      comparative relation to others as well as a <I>méconaissance</I> of the 
      self. The pronoun serves a stabilizing, invisibly mensurative and 
      commensurating function in this circuit, acting as "erased money": "Why 
      did pronoun see RHYS CHATHAM across the / entrance to <I>a store</I> sort 
      of an erased money" (6). The self, its first guise this disguise, may 
      circulate in the coin of the pronoun as within "defensive armor" (Lacan, 
      "Aggressivity" 17): "<I>Charlestein</I> / <I>degraded him</I> also 
      <I>Charlatan who</I> <I>see the little</I> BIG WHO IN your money" 
      (19).<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT19" 
      name=REF19>19</A></SUP> Weiner also observes that the catachrestical, 
      objective value of the pronoun prevents inflation: "Every- / thing seems 
      to be <I>negative</I> five dollars more than <I>pronoun</I> CUT IT SHORT / 
      WHYS says OUT asked about a table see 40 price 45 NO HANNAH DUNGA- / REES 
      pronoun's are used cost $3 <I>much quieter</I> energy than the DUMB grey / 
      corduroys HOW ARE YOU <I>free pants</I>" (11). Yet pronouns are also an 
      exaction, the condition of an exchange that might seem fair, but is not 
      free. 
      <P align=justify>Indeed, even as the mechanisms of "rational" transaction 
      are anatomized and demystified by the journal, there is nevertheless a 
      pervasive sense that the constant externalization of language, spoiling 
      even momentary fictions of mastery, cannot but take its subjective toll. 
      If clairvoyance's <B>[End Page 132]</B> exteriority allows for an 
      understanding of metalepsis, it does not produce an exit through which 
      Weiner may leave behind what will stubbornly persist in following her, the 
      fact of meaning itself. Short-circuiting the reversal accomplished by the 
      legerdemain of interiority leaves belief intact, as the existential 
      indeterminacy of the words is always already gainsaid by their 
      recognizability.<SUP><A

      name=REF20>20</A></SUP> Just recognizing words <I>given</I> to be 
      seen--much less the process of reading, transcribing, and reacting to 
      them--testifies to their persuasiveness and grants them, without any 
      conscious agency on Weiner's part, meaning: "I've h/<I>e</I>/ad another 
      HOLY DAY AT THE TYPEWRITER" (8). That their appearance is not controlled 
      by Weiner, but is nevertheless contingent upon her presence creates a 
      glaringly asymmetrical relation, an uncomfortable loss of equanimity. 
      Hoarding meaning even as they impossibly deny it, clairvoyant phenomena 
      force a <I>visible</I> instantiation of self-difference that inevitably 
      recapitulates a mensurative scenario, but in a relation of disequivalence, 
      one that Weiner herself experiences as a punishing reflexivity. 
      <P align=justify>This double bind is in full force in the history Weiner 
      gives of clairvoyance's "primal scene." Weiner's relation of this 
      history--even as we must take her word that it faithfully conforms to 
      events that she alone was party to--is rigorously structured, consisting 
      in three carefully chosen examples that demonstrate the logical 
      development of the linguistic paradoxes inherent in the experience of 
      clairvoyance: 
      <P align=justify>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract--><I>When the words first began to appear in 
        August 1972, they appeared singly. The first word, WRONG, appeared about 
        an inch long, neatly printed at a 45 degree angle to my pant leg. Later 
        words appeared in two word phrases some of which, as NO-ALONE, I did not 
        understand (</I>Early Journals<I>, 1972, unpublished). In my naive (or 
        natural form) desire for completion I would cry "where is my T--is it 
        the phrase 'not alone' that is meant" and why cannot I or it or the 
        spirits that I then sometimes thought it was, speak English. The phrases

        Journal <I>(1974, Angel Hair 1978). In April sometime I think I got down 
        on my knees and begged or prayed, please let me see one complete 
        sentence. On April 15th I did see one, printed in small letters on the 
        edge of my kitchen table that had come to me from Lenny Neufeld via 
        Jerry Rothenberg. It said, "YOU WON'T BE ANY HAPPIER." ("Mostly" 55)</I> 
        <B>[End Page 133]</B> <!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify>The first word Weiner sees clairvoyantly is "WRONG." Like 
      a notice stating, "Don't read this," the word's content paradoxically 
      negates its phenomenalization: as the word's very legibility marks out for 
      it a certain persistence, it must be "right," yet it gives its meaning as 
      "wrong." In its unsettling play of self-subverting self-referentiality, 
      the word either challenges its own right to exist or it labels itself as 
      the sole but improper vehicle for another point of view. It both affirms 
      and denies itself, and in this case, since Weiner reads it, its denial is 
      its means of affirmation. The next instance, "NO-ALONE," is at once 
      obviously a phrase and something that falls just shy of being a phrase. 
      Its disfiguring truncation renders it opaque, withholding the "closure" or 
      clarity Weiner "naively" or "naturally" desires. The word's "T" is not 
      merely not <I>there</I>, but <I>not-there</I>, missing--the word has a 
      whole form of which she will receive only a part. Its loss migrates to 
      become her loss, as Weiner turns the lack within the phrase on herself: 
      she is the one who cannot read it. This phrase is also eerily 
      self-referential, as form purposively cripples its content. Weiner is 
      prevented from understanding a message (potentially) about the structural 
      given of understanding, "not alone." Although it is "NO-ALONE" that cannot 
      "speak English," the mutilated phrase induces in Weiner a sense that it 
      may be read correctly. This contradiction within the words--that as they 
      announce their illegibility, illegibility itself becomes what is read, and 
      that this illegibility is in turn reversed to become a standard of 
      completion by the reading, believing subject who thus cannot measure 
      up--is also evinced by the long-awaited, complete clairvoyant phrase, "YOU 
      WON'T BE ANY HAPPIER." Longing for a plenitude of meaning, for the 
      sentience of the sentence, Weiner sees what appears to be not merely a 
      piece of floating text, but a response. This correct sentence again pits 
      content against form, delivering a message about the impossibility of 
      plenitude as if heedless of its own completion. On the one hand, the 
      sentence's point is that the unit of any meaningful utterance is the 
      sentence.<SUP><A

      name=REF21>21</A></SUP> On the other, it <I>tells</I> Weiner that, 
      complete or not, it retains its opacity, its alterity, even as it gives an 
      answer. 
      <P align=justify>Weiner embeds these paradoxes in the journal's form. 
      Working within the material constraints imposed by her electric 
      typewriter, she lets each of the three typescripts utilized in the journal 
      correspond to a given word's place of appearance: the words written in all 
      capitals were seen at large (or, as Weiner notes in the introduction to 
      the journal, projected on her forehead from within); the words given in 
      italics were sighted on the apparatus or on the page; and the words in 
      lower-case <B>[End Page 134]</B> issued "normally" from Weiner herself 
      ("Mostly" 60). She found, however, that these objective, material 
      distinctions were always already <I>congruent</I> to voice: "It turned out 
      that the regular upper and lower case words described what I was doing, 
      the CAPITALS gave me orders, and the underlines or italics made comments. 
      This is not 100% true, but mostly so" ("Mostly" 60). Not only does Weiner 
      posit the restriction of material finitude against a frictionless mode of 
      recording that would allow a direct encounter with "mental detritus" 
      (Damon), the concrete limits of representation are always already 
      metaphorized, the tonal attributes of each typescript defining an 
      attitudinal posture within the clairvoyant scenario. 
      <P align=justify>Given that it is through these voices that Weiner herself 
      comes into being as the abased apostrophe of the text and in turn cannot 
      but apostrophize the fragments she sees--"I SEE A BIG APOSTROPHE" 
      (<I>Clairvoyant</I> 10)--she effectively uses the imperative mood and the 
      quasi mood of commentary to color the otherwise commutative vocative case 
      or figure. Weiner also defies the lyric's rhetorical pretensions to 
      objectivity, "the defensive motion of understanding" (de Man, 
      "Anthropomorphism" 261). As Paul de Man cautions, figures of consciousness 
      that deny their own mediation and propose the totalized commensurability 
      of readers are built into language; for de Man, this "complicity of 
      epistemology and rhetoric, of truth and trope" marks the violent 
      assimilation of metaphor to concept, to normativity (243). Against this, 
      the journal demonstrates that language's authority-effect as it inheres 
      most basically in the figure of apostrophe cannot be other than 
      <I>multiple and relational</I>. Indeed, Weiner manages to do this because 
      she has established precisely how, at what cost, and to whom the written 
      voice and reading subject have always already returned trope to concept 
      and thus denied figurativity. The obvious suggestion of triangulation 
      within the structure of the journal shows not only that it is 
      <I>possible</I> that the authority we credit may not be credited back to 
      us, but that social and syntactical protocols <I>require</I> the 
      overdetermination of difference to prop abstract equivalence. 
      <P align=justify>Thus ingeniously inverting the lyric through the text's 
      apostrophe of her in the least possible equalizing mood, the imperative, 
      Weiner demonstrates that the self in roman typescript is perpetually 
      indebted for her own representation to the words in capitals that 
      interpellate her: "YOU'RE A PRONOUN" (6), "QUOTE" (5), "DONT FINISH THIS 
      SENTENCE STRUCTURE" (6), "USE THE FIRST PERSON I, THE PERSON" (20). From 
      capitals issue orders and proclamations that make the slightest action on 
      the part of the self already reactive: "CUPCAKE There's / so <B>[End Page 
      135]</B> much interference while I was doing the dishes USE SOAP" (8). 
      Here the self appears vulnerable to suggestion even in daily habits. This 
      not only denaturalizes mundane activities, but expropriates the self's 
      agency as her daily activities appear as demands coming from without. 
      Given the ostentatious whimsy of its commands, the method of this 
      exteriorized authority is its madness. The voice of the "ought" is often 
      rudely interruptive ("SORRY ABOUT THIS PAGE STUPID" [8]), charging a 
      phrase being written by the self or an object in the world to correspond 
      with an imperative hitherto invisible or unrelated--indeed, one obviously 
      produced by its very appearance: "Last night sleeping with him / <I>thank 
      you single</I> Rhys interfer- / ence when we were about to fuck TWO WOMEN 
      TWO CHILDREN HONEY- / MOON and TOOTS so we SHUT UP didn't OBEY REINDEER" 
      (34). With its decided emphasis on ends over means, the imperative voice 
      in Weiner's text is obviously not categorical in the Kantian sense. Its 
      contours are those of the selfish demands of a voice hierarchically 
      removed, yet all too familiar. Meaning as the performative effect of its 
      ludicrously imperious, rather than contractual, expression is 
      exaggeratedly unreasonable, equally infantile and tyrannical, even as the 
      formal mandate through which that authority is expressed may posture as 
      justly authorized. 
      <P align=justify>If clairvoyance spoils the precarious promise of symmetry 
      between the sending and receiving sides of language by presenting the 
      position assumed to authorize meaning as ridiculous, contingent, and 
      absolute, the third voice of Weiner's structure draws out the dynamism of 
      exchange as ratiocinative procedure. Although the mandate of capitals 
      would appear to orient the transactions of the page, giving them their 
      form and their value, italics shows subordination to be not entirely 
      inescapable. If meaning must be surrendered to words appearing 
      clairvoyantly to the self, the matter of establishing what that meaning 
      consists in becomes distinctly contestatory, as the words in italics 
      engage Weiner in an itinerary of corroboration and dissent, layering the 
      modalities of knowledge available within the journal's textual field. 
      Recuperated as an apostrophe (thus not pure trope) and displaced from the 
      frantically responding self, italicized words become a viable position in 
      excess to capitals' authority. They are inscribed as an incompletely 
      colonized difference that contributes to the erosion of the text's 
      supposed specularity: "Kathy said she felt like she was prostituting 
      herself and she dreamt about <I>our / dream / very bad vibes / follow the 
      leader</I> / she didn't want to follow the leader she was supposed to" 
      (16). Yet if the italicized text, with its often sarcastic, rather <B>[End 
      Page 136]</B> than sympathetic, "commentary" does not automatically 
      recapitulate the more obvious hegemony of capitals, it nonetheless 
      maintains an ambivalence towards the self, becoming a vehicle of power 
      more subtly masked: "<I>go to grief</I> TRYING to OUT <I>ask forgiven</I> 
      to read the underlines SAVE" (16). For both self and italics take up a 
      commentative or narrative mode, though the self is anxiously reactive in 
      relating knowledge, while the italics are somewhat sadistically detached 
      in doing so. 
      <P align=justify>As Charles Bernstein observes of the journal, "An 
      electric energy that completely fills the page [. . .] manages to fuse the 
      eruptive fragments ('voices') into a continuity" ("Making" 284); "the text 
      makes one piece of (with) all this activity" (285). Bernstein's 
      appreciation of Weiner's accomplishment in unifying the discrepant 
      elements of her text is not entirely misplaced, but it does mask Weiner's 
      larger point, which is that <I>the text cannot fall apart</I>. The 
      epistemological positions composing the field never become altogether 
      discrete, for the differences in value they would produce share in the 
      determinate meaning figured by apostrophe. Yet the journal also <I>strains 
      against</I> the double life of value in its three-voice economy, as modal 
      inflections traduce their material forms when the typescripts not only 
      seem utterly arbitrary, but even flamboyantly unable to contain their 
      points of reference. 
      <P align=justify><I>Clairvoyant Journal</I>, in fact, establishes layers 
      of sense and levels of discourse adhering to the materiality of language 
      in spite of the "multiple autonomies" (Kimball) dominating it, often 
      undermining, rather than deferring to Weiner's admittedly abstract schema. 
      The journal maintains an edgy present tense on the cusp of its own 
      emergence--not merely referentially, in the sense that Weiner keeps up 
      with what she sees and how she reacts, but by attending to the language 
      once she has written it: "#?% % JINGLE BELLS" (7); "DO NUT oh <I>I'm a 
      nut</I> I eat donuts <I>you believe</I>" (15). Weiner is now really seeing 
      things, <I>clairvoyant</I>, because she composes through the material 
      aspect of "seen" words; to be clairvoyant is thus paradoxically to turn 
      the ritual mundanity of believing in words <I>inside out</I>. Letting 
      meaning coast on such tomfoolery takes courage: "April Fool BRAVE GIRL" 
      (15). Even as the journal records clairvoyance as an experience of the 
      vertiginous excess in language recuperated in materially literalized, 
      externalized figures of authority, in counterpoint to this serious matter 
      are associative distractions that refuse materiality's subordination to 
      meaning: "Try praying: Our father who art <I>be right over</I> / A song: 
      Here we go round the mulberry bush the / <I>grapefruit John</I> the mulber 
      y <I>mush</I> GIVE UP" (9). Yet in this particular hilarious <B>[End Page 
      137]</B> interchange between devotion and non sequitur, between memory and 
      iteration, among sense, sound, and sight rhyme, it is Weiner trying to 
      establish belief, and the words outside her that are playing around. As 
      power is revealed to be the meaning of even this most literal sense, the 
      otherwise materializing tactics of insubordination may be turned over to 
      the authorities. Weiner submits voice, including her own, to 
      superimposition and discrepancy, alluding to an unreachable alterity; in 
      doing so, she creates not an undecideable text, but a clairvoyant one, in 
      which the reader experiences the supplement of materiality as a 
      contradictory analogue to her reading presence. 
      <P align=justify>
      <H3 align=left><!--_a-head-->Without Margins <!--_/a-head--></H3>
      <P align=justify>The remarkable figurativity with which Weiner invests 
      typography is also at work in her use of space and spacing. In a 
      discussion with Charles Bernstein on poetic lineation, Weiner observes 
      that her lines do not conform to justified margins ("Excerpts"). Rather, 
      she extends her writing as far out to the right-hand side of the page as 
      possible. Turning the tables on the normative distinction between the 
      "material" (or "literal") and the "figurative," Weiner describes that her 
      poetic line only figuratively ends even at the edge of the page, for her 
      text is actually indefinitely continuous. Weiner further states that her 
      marginless poems also incorporate intermittent "breathing" spaces as 
      compositional elements. She opposes these breaks within the text to the 
      compositionally immaterial breaks that the material page dictates; the 
      spaces, like the text indefinitely postponing the edge of the page, 
      further indicate that the borders of her poems are indeterminate. Thus, 
      the blanks within Weiner's page are also <I>writing</I>. 
      <P align=justify>For Weiner, then, a standardized margin is another 
      instance of "pre-thought thinking" like the coercive precondition of 
      belief: its blankness signals a putatively evacuated area where the 
      normative text takes place.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT22" 
      name=REF22>22</A></SUP> To presume upon this blankness is to demonstrate 
      an inadequate awareness that legibility requires an <I>active</I> clearing 
      of the ground against which figures are set. Weiner's spacing draws a 
      blank, making us aware of space as a figure. This breathing space, Weiner 
      suggests, is a particularly suitable trope for the indefinite continuity 
      she aims to represent. However, there is a strange ambiguity to Weiner's 
      spacing that is also productive: her spaces signal indeterminacy, because 
      they are used as text would be in a continuing poetic line, but they also 
      act as doubles for the definite margin <B>[End Page 138]</B> surrounding 
      the normative text, because they are made up of the same material 
      blankness. Conversely, the margin would thus seem to contain and to mark, 
      however blankly, the formal exile of the indeterminate from the normative 
      text. Weiner's works suggest that the silence of the margin always marks a 
      silencing, a place of violence and loss. But what is entailed in regarding 
      "the negative presentation of the indeterminate" (Lyotard 56), the 
      disavowed fact of indefiniteness exiled to and expressed by the margin, as 
      such a silencing? Weiner explicitly theorizes the violence wrought by a 
      self-validating presumption of blankness and the counterproduction of an 
      antinegative space in two short companion texts written nonclairvoyantly 
      and published in the same volume, <I>WRITTEN IN</I> and <I>The Zero 
      One</I> (1985). 
      <P align=justify>Like the title of <I>Spoke</I>, a major work by Weiner 
      that thematizes the anonymity of the agent in the simple past tense in 
      English, the title <I>WRITTEN IN</I> maximizes a certain ambiguity of 
      reference. It refers to the book as a finished object, the passive 
      construction suggesting a production the origins of which are already 
      mystified. Recorded on the title page below the title is the phrase: 
      "Written in a blank book called Homo Futurus by Barbara Rosenthal."<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT23" 
      name=REF23>23</A></SUP> This doubling of the phrase--"Written in" 
      following "<I>WRITTEN IN</I>"--corresponds to a subtle doubling of the 
      referent: "<I>WRITTEN IN</I>" is the name of the work, not the state of 
      the book, for what has been "written in a blank book" cannot be the book 
      itself, but a text having a separate existence. (Indeed, this distinction 
      is the bedrock ideological presumption behind the monumental literary 
      work.) Although they have now been putatively distinguished, nearly the 
      whole of <I>WRITTEN IN</I> will work to undermine what can only be a 
      <I>metaphorical</I> distinction separating materiality and figurativity, a 
      metaphor facilitated precisely by the presumption of blank space. 
      Beginning with the title page, Weiner has already redirected what 
      blankness consists in: it is a site at once indefinitely prospective and 
      yet formally anticipatory, one that can only bear the title "Homo 
      Futurus." Blankness is in fact no different from the text itself.<SUP><A

      <P align=justify>Chiasmically weaving between views of the text as already 
      completed and as in the process of being written, the writer is torn 
      between feeling that the completely blank book is an undisciplined space 
      "without cut-offs" and that it is oppressively limited: "publishsed . . . 
      it has a / finished form. It is a closed / book." It allows for 
      "self-indulgent" yet "finished" sentences; in the abstract, it creates a 
      purely present temporality, "cross out the past tense," but in "a closed 
      form" that makes what would be in the present curiously already complete. 
      More than anything else, Weiner seems to be remarking on not writing 
      clairvoyantly: she is not used to working with a blank page. Yet she also 
      constructs a distinctly uncomfortable tension between the closure of the 
      book as an ideal published object and the figurative, material 
      expansiveness of its white pages. 
      <P align=justify>Throughout the first half of the book, Weiner explores 
      the fundamental contradiction of a whiteness functioning as an originary 
      unity from which blankness and text may then emerge as determinate 
      difference. As she points out, such a premise is bound up in the practices 
      of sequential reading and writing that presuppose the totalization of the 
      text, disciplined procedures from which she attempts to free herself by 
      writing a page of the book from the bottom up, producing a portion of the 
      text that must be read backwards (6). Directly following this, Weiner 
      muses on the contrary scene of Biblical Creation: "all the words and / 
      lines follow one another / in sequence Like the world / was created and 
      Adam <B>[End Page 140]</B> was / made" (6). She has earlier indirectly 
      remarked that a centered, temporal vantage point conjoined to an 
      authorized act is a fiction at the basis of privilege. Discussing the 
      disavowed dependence of a supposed positive racial whiteness on a 
      material, determinate difference that is always already in effect, she 
      writes: "The white race is late. // The white race is late coming / to 
      consciousness said Coyote [. . .] The white / race is on this page / 
      written in ink of color / The white race uses a lot / of periods" (5). 
      Produced by the opposition between ink and blank, the "white race" uses 
      closure effects, "a lot / of periods," to discipline the production of a 
      differential relation of which it claims no knowledge, allowing meaning to 
      appear to guarantee itself in self-identity with the signifier. As Weiner 
      writes, this distances the reader from the materiality of the text: 
      "Meanings make you think / of about instead of what's / on the page" (5). 
      She goes on to note that the presumption of abstract equivalence among 
      readers is propped on the production of a material social difference 
      similarly disavowed: "There are / politics everywhere including / the 
      language which commands / obedience to its meaning [. . .] All the / 
      treaties were broken so / written is not the truth" (5). Referring to the 
      many land and sovereignty treaties the U.S. has broken with Native 
      Americans, the lines reveal that contract is based not on self-evident 
      principles, nor necessarily on the equivalence of two parties, but on a 
      coercion that relies on a power differential between those who make the 
      agreement, thus traducing the fiction that enables contract in the first 
      place. Desiring "to disobey the government of the margin" (9) that 
      establishes this differential, Weiner writes in the book lengthwise to 
      effect a certain redistribution: "This is principle to sacrifice comfort / 
      for a long line equidistant between / margins" (8). 
      <P align=justify>Later in the work, Weiner effectively isolates blankness 
      and text as elements producing an irreducible threshold of recognizability 
      demarcating the "place" of reading. That self-referentiality inheres in 
      margin <I>and</I> text renders the difference between the two radically 
      indeterminate; however, once the schema of signification conscripts margin 
      and text indiscriminantly, the text is prone to becoming absolute 
      generalization, pure language, against which Weiner posits temporal 
      heterogeneity and voice: "THIS IS LANGUAGE // This is language this is 
      written in but / the ordinary form of the simple spoken word // THIS IS 
      OMITTED" (12); "This is objective although this is also / my personal 
      experience as a writer / and the personal experience of writing / goes 
      down with each word" (12). Even as Weiner toys with a figure of absolute 
      commensurability, "THIS IS <B>[End Page 141]</B> LANGUAGE," and rhymes it 
      typographically with the graphicization of a blank that can no longer be 
      thought of as such, "THIS IS OMITTED," she reinscribes blankness, an 
      invisible "personal experience" going down with each word, as an alterity 
      inhabiting the mark, whether space or text. 
      <P align=justify>Ultimately, Weiner proposes that the margin may be not 
      only the best figurative analogue for the particularity of each 
      reader/writer, but that irregular spacing within the text may be the best 
      way to give rise to substantially variegated readings and to force the 
      essential heterodoxy of reading onto the reader's notice through 
      interruption: "the owner of the line is the / margin which refuses to give 
      / any sense of rhythm in this / varied length the expectation is / 
      confused in the mind and the hand / and each beginning of a line must be / 
      begun anew with a different rhythm"(13). Such spacing "gives no 
      consolation" to either reader or writer, as the experience of 
      particularity is one of being vanquished; yet this use of the margin to 
      allow for such a textual experience also puts us exactly on the level with 
      language.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT25" 
      name=REF25>25</A></SUP> The text too is split between "about" and 
      "writing": "Itself / writes about / itself writing" (13). Although 
      commensurability would thus seem to turn on the absolute loss of the 
      particular, we must also imagine writing as the radically incomplete 
      finitude of phenomena unfolding: "form and space make it difficult / to 
      say everything but so does history and political aesthetics" (13-14). If, 
      with the aid of an indefinite margin, we take part in this unfolding 
      without violence, we embrace reading as non-self-identical possibility, as 
      never congruent to the formal recognizability entailed by "History" and 
      "Political Aesthetics": "the margins have not given in / but have varied 
      themselves / and so has the space this / is because <I>a book was / not 
      written this book / is written</I>" (14 my emphasis). 
      <P align=justify> <I>The Zero One</I> is, by contrast, an extremely dark 
        work. Space--in the form of columns that progressively discipline individual 
        lines into highly abstract units of five characters (the average number 
        of characters per word in English)--is used to mutilate and obliterate 
        (see <A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman_fig02.html">fig. 
        2</A>). Composed of five separate pieces formed of lists of sentences, 
        the project employs a base-five system of numeration, with the "1" numeral 
        replaced by "I," signifying both the pronoun and the designator of a universal 
        set in Boolean algebra. Weiner uses the numbers {0, I, 2, 3, 4} as attachments 
        to and disruptions of individual words; the numerals also seal off and, 
        more often, prevent the continuation of whole lines. Words and lines are 
        additionally radically truncated both by the regular imposition of the 
        five-character unit and seemingly at random. This distribution of blanks 
        <B>[End Page 142]</B> and numbers violently fractures the text and comments 
        directly on the subject matter of the book, which falls into several related 
        categories of statements. 
      <P align=justify>Most prevalent are descriptions pertaining to the state 
      terrorism and genocide carried out against the indigenous Mayan population 
      of the Guatemalan highlands, operations that were at their bloodiest in 
      the early 1980s and that eventually claimed in excess of 200,000 
      lives.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT26" 
      name=REF26>26</A></SUP> Though these statements, like all of the sentences 
      composing the work, are either broken or unfinished and thus develop no 
      decisive relationships among the elements they contain, they discernibly 
      refer to CIA involvement in the atrocities and to the enormous number of 
      refugees generated by the violence: "Failing to win any assur from0 / the 
      Guatemalan regime that0 it0I2" (19); "60?000 refugees in Chiapas outsi 
      the0I" (19); "Aided by CIA pilots and 0I fight" (19). Clearly pertinent to 
      the work is the fact that as a matter of policy in representing these 
      events, the Reagan administration adopted disinformation strategies so 
      grievous--"There is0I2 no Mexican military detachment" (23)--that the 
      president declared reports of the eradication of Mayan villages and the 
      scorched-earth tactics of the army unfounded, even as U.S. intelligence 
      corroborated these accounts and, <B>[End Page 143]</B> indeed, as Reagan 
      himself lifted bans on military aid to Guatemala specifically to enable 
      the dictatorship's activities.<SUP><A

      <P align=justify>Official disinformation strategies are also implicated in 
      two other categories of statements: one comprised of descriptions of the 
      1975 incident at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation that led to the killing 
      of, in addition to a Native American man, two fbi agents, for whose deaths 
      Leonard Peltier, a leader of the American Indian Movement, was sentenced 
      to two consecutive life terms in the absence of conclusive evidence tying 
      him to the crime: "No0I2 one0I knows who shot the agents" (23); "Aim0I 
      direc in Prison 89637-I32" (22); and another comprised of descriptions of 
      intolerable conditions leading to prisoner hunger strikes at several 
      prisons, including the federal penitentiary in Marion, Illinois where 
      Peltier was then currently jailed: "prisoners are beaten at random mistr 
      and0I" (19). 
      <P align=justify>Along with documenting extremely violent repression and 
      containment and establishing the interrelation between these situations, 
      Weiner includes religious and political statements from a Native American 
      point of view: "when we have no0I2 recou to justice in greeds iron house 
      0I234" (20); slogans and details related to various freedom and protest 
      movements, "International workers' solidarity day0I was 0I" (19), "Socia 
      worke for Peace and Nuclear Disarm" (22); commercial and canned, 
      movie-inspired phrases: "so you want to0I2 be0I2 a triathlete? Here's how" 
      (20), "What d'ya say ya0I2 wanna roll out of here. yeah" (20); sentences 
      in her own voice: "I learned how to0I2 dance since I was small" (20); and, 
      lastly, a large number of ironically self-referential, or otherwise 
      malformed, phrases: "This is the first time0 this sentence is being used 
      and0I someI" (20), "There is no reason for this sente to0I2 / understand 
      with the same feeli and0I" (18), "distinguished from minor sente which" 
      (19), "Ive0I notic repetition" (23), "It0I2 is0I2 patently clear that many 
      of" (23). 
      <P align=justify>Weiner's integration of paradoxical sentences points 
      directly to her equally paradoxical title, <I>The Zero One</I>. Most 
      evidently, <I>The Zero One</I> refers to the logical and mathematical 
      properties of the "zero" and "one" in a modern statistical totality. As 
      Jacques-Alain Miller has discussed, the relationship between these digits 
      is key to Gottlob Frege's reconceptualization of the binary operation of 
      addition, which, by eradicating the empirical subject from the scene of 
      counting, enables the social ascension of a transcendental subject, the 
      formal involution of a sutured, objective field of knowledge, and the 
      production of self-identical logical objects, <B>[End Page 144]</B> 
      primordially constituted as idealized, generalized units--that is, as 
      repetitions of the one. Miller goes on to demonstrate that the logical 
      field retains a trace of the empirical counting subject in the signifier 
      of the null set, zero, for the zero is a paradoxical logical object, the 
      marker or place where the "non-conceptualizable is conceptualized" (30). 
      <P align=justify>Zero is not nothing; if the one, in its self-identity, 
      appears as a pure positive presence, this is accomplished through its 
      determinate relation of difference to the marker of its fictional pure 
      absence, the zero. Logical and linguistic truth as well as the 
      faithfulness of statistical representation depend upon the determinate 
      absence of objects from the null set defined by "the concept 
      not-identical-with-itself." Trading on a sense of absence conveyed 
      graphically by its cipher, "0," this putative blank is the designator of 
      indeterminacy negatively determined (Lyotard 56), alluded to only by the 
      signifier of its formal exile, the concept's subsumption of nothing. 
      Miller points out that in Frege's mode of numeration, zero, as a number 
      assigned to a concept, is also the first number within the system: "The 
      system is thus so constituted <I>with the 0 counting as 1</I>" (30 
      emphasis original). This strange number, named by Weiner's title <I>The 
      Zero One</I>, formally encloses the signifiable totality by denoting the 
      purely ideal relation or circulation among object, concept, and number 
      (effectively, generality's subsumption of the particular). Ironically, the 
      ideality of the "one," a unit, is actually modeled on the ideal relations 
      of the zero, a formal non-unit, of which the "central paradox to be 
      grasped . . . is that the trait of the identical represents the 
      non-identical" (32).1 Although the actual operation of counting (or 
      speaking) gives rise to the illusion of numerical positivity (the 
      intentional structure of meaning), the addition of every unit always 
      occurs in relation to its opposite, the zero (the speaking subject), the 
      suturing function abolishing the indeterminate traced within it (the 
      paradoxical [non]guarantee of meaning). 
      <P align=justify><I>The Zero One</I> allegorizes the trace structure 
      involved in the production of a statistical totality by 
      <I>re-performing</I> these inclusionary, determining operations on its 
      materials. In doing so, it erodes and at times destroys the statements' 
      messages and, both literally and figuratively, ruins the illusion of their 
      wholeness and transparency. Weiner's progressive digitalizing of the text, 
      which serializes words by forcing them to conform to the five-character 
      unit, reenacts the abstracting operation of counting that undergirds the 
      statements' many horrific statistics: "Six0I hundr of the 3,I00 refugees 
      at Las Delicias" (23); "Thous of0I2 refug along the0I Mexic Guate" (24). 
      (The zero digit is specifically used in its form <B>[End Page 145]</B> as 
      the paradoxical "zero one," as it makes up one of the five characters.) In 
      reversing the suture's erasure of its violence, Weiner uncovers an 
      alterity that corresponds not to a recoverable "outside," but to 
      difference mutilated by the contact of violent determination. We get 
      another story, but not the whole one; disappearing the disappeared, the 
      damaged form of the statements possesses an eerie accuracy in materially 
      reflecting the massacres that are their content.<SUP><A

      name=REF28>28</A></SUP> The very presence of the statements is itself 
      blackly ironic, for they represent an enduring discursive colonization of 
      precisely those insurrectionary political elements, aim and the Guatemalan 
      <I>campesino</I> collectives, that distinctly totalitarian states seek to 
      obliterate. The reports of indigenous, so-called aboriginal groups facing 
      genocide structurally resemble the ab-originary suppression of 
      non-identity in the zero in its negative, circumscribed presentation: "in 
      the Western Hemis they0 started to kill Indians 0I234 0I234" (20). 
      Heterogeneity is only re-marked by smuggled information about its 
      suppression and extermination. And though counting from zero would exclude 
      "the possibility of predecessors" (Rotman 14), the trace of this 
      indeterminate, unrecognized possibility haunts what would expel it, as "a 
      hallucination within the hallucination that is already speech" (Derrida, 
      "Violence" 89). In this violent expropriation and eradication of space, 
      disavowed in disinformation that circulates in its place an emptiness, the 
      self-interested blindness of the ordinal conflicts with and overwrites the 
      empiricism of the cardinal: "This Sentence May Be Divid And0I" (19). 
      Weiner switches this: "The first sentence was very diffi to0I2 / This 
      prison is one of the most0 moder" (19). 
      <P align=justify>While Weiner suggests that some reliance on imposing the 
      "zero-one" may be necessary, given the importance of documenting these 
      events and publicizing the statistics, she also shows a distinct 
      preference for less definite groupings: "there are pow wows0 and0I more 
      pow wows; it is the0I pow0I / wow season in Oklahoma! 0I234 0I234" (20), 
      as well as for objects not predetermined by the logical field of 
      possibility: "I have all these books that I read and I read legen and0I I 
      read / stories" (20). As she explains, "The0I formi of a question, for 
      exit takes / place aroun and about this sway" (22). Weiner also points, 
      with a contradictory self-referential phrase, to definite articles as 
      markers of a formal closure that erases itself, the positivity of the 
      object the article denotes seeming to entail the production of the "the" 
      and not vice versa: "One or more THES0 have0 been used in one or sente 
      0I234" (21). On the other hand, "the" may at times have its uses: "Ask 
      them to order the0I abolishment of the Control <B>[End Page 146]</B> Unit 
      0I234 0I234" (20). In general, however, "Theories dont make0 a0I23 good 
      picture" (20): "The0I survi of the priarie dog is proof / posit that0 both 
      Hegel and Kant were wrong / in0I2 their understanding of the 'New World' / 
      My0I2 peopl thank you for your help / All0I of012 the nouns write" (23). 
      The Native American voice becomes an empirical "noun" contradicting Hegel 
      and Kant's "proof posit."<SUP><A

      <P align=justify><I>The Zero One</I> does not exhibit a longing for a 
      reality prior to the subsumption of the empirical world by numbers, but 
      rather an argument against what universalizing judgment, or the 
      transcendentalized subject, takes to be a determinate opposition between 
      presence and absence, a fiction that facilitates the illusion of 
      counting's objectivity and a violent amnesia regarding the construction of 
      its objects. As Weiner writes, "What it says is0I2 separ and the way it 
      says it disco 0I234" (20): what is said is putatively separate from the 
      way it is said; the world is "disco"-vered, not produced. An oppositional 
      principle overdetermining empirical difference (and differential 
      valuation), zero also actively produces absence, seeking to annihilate 
      what would seem incommensurable within the sutured set it establishes, 
      i.e., whatever cannot be idealized and thus counted. Indeed, despite 
      Weiner's diligent documentation of the horrifically proliferating numbers 
      of victims of officially denied atrocities, administrations cannot be held 
      accountable. Within self-validating regimes willing to enforce the unity 
      of their authority, guaranteed by zero, at any cost, words are entirely 
      too productive--"Stres the0I reali of0I2 the0I word0 01234" (25)--yet 
      erase the traces that they are so. For Weiner, "There are other ways to 
      write 0I234" (18) that require us to "Go012 beyon form0 to0I2 achie poetr 
      0I234" (24). Poetry's task is to demonstrate that "The0I only0 real in 
      writing is writing itself" (22). This reality is indeterminate, involving 
      the paradox inhering not only in an obviously malformed phrase, but in any 
      linguistic instance: shadowed by the zero one, each utterance displays a 
      contradictory failure to totalize itself, an anti-self-referentiality. 
      Unless we acknowledge at the level of language a heterogeneity other to 
      information, we face, and in our ignorance become parties to, eradications 
      presented as the margins of history.

      writing: Weiner does not report sightings or reactions that do not come 
      from within the experiential activity of writing clairvoyantly. The 
      relationship between clairvoyance and writing thus frames their 
      referentiality, the seen words no longer taken by Weiner for intentional 
      vehicles circulating within a reality prior to the text. Thus closed off 
      from any extratextual referent, this utterly self-referential writing 
      gives rise to a peculiar species of performativity. If, in general, the 
      performative utterance takes itself as its own referent, generating power 
      and sense of its own initiative (or appears to cite or represent a 
      displaced authoritative guarantee), the act necessarily subscribing to its 
      own content-effect, the reflexivity of Weiner's writing creates "a scene 
      that, illustrating nothing . . . beyond itself, illustrates nothing" 
      (Derrida, "Double" 208). The text produces not a content-effect, but "the 
      effect of a medium" (212).

      subject of the first poem in <I>Spoke</I>. Taking the form of a journal 
      entry (see <A

      3</A>), the poem appears at first glance to record the author's 
      recollection of a prior event, a Saturday bicycle ride. However, as Weiner 
      soon enough makes clear, the bicycle she rides is the present moment of 
      writing: "myname it's a very funny long bicycle poem about nothing written 
      indoors" (7). Unlike its conventional two-wheeled counterpart, Weiner's 
      bicycle has a "THIRD TIRE," with the "w" above the "RD" in "THIRD" making 
      this tire a "w-rd." As Weiner demonstrates, <I>writing is usually a 
      bicycle</I>: a vehicle for getting to/representing something in the world. 
      By contrast, Weiner's writing practice uses the word as a <I>third</I> 
      tire involving no such "decidable exteriority" ("Double" 210). Weiner's 
      words become referentially indeterminate; the poem is more an "exercy 
      machine" that merely mimics movement than <B>[End Page 148]</B> a bicycle: 
      "when I give up right bicycling on this floorexplain upstairs / exercy 
      machine and I write me" (7). The strange mistakability of an actual ride 
      on an actual bicycle for a stint on the exercycle parallels the 
      mistakability between writing as reference (riding) and writing as act. As 
      so often in Weiner's oeuvre, the self, reading as it writes and thus 
      ceding to the function of apostrophe, finds itself drawn into a specular 
      exchange: "sis Iaposm riding a bicycle all the / time Im seeing this words 
      SEEING" (7). But this "speculum reflects no reality; it produces mere 
      'reality-effects'" ("Double" 206); the text demonstrates that the most 
      basic specular relation, "I'm seeing this," is simply a side-effect 
      generated by structure. The poem has become a hall of mirrors where "the 
      signifying allusion does not go through the looking glass" (210), 
      operating, through a linguistic illusion/allusion, only <I>as if</I> it 
      refers to an order outside it; the poem remarks on its indifference to the 
      division between the two. Another analogue for the opposition between word 
      and referent that Weiner dissolves may be found at the top of the page: 
      "on the train sat b/i/c/y/c/l/e" (7). Words appear to harbor irreducibly 
      opposing intentions; they are doubled vehicles.<SUP><A

      Poems</I>, unlike the difference that italics make or the differential 
      relation between capitals <B>[End Page 149]</B> and self in <I>Clairvoyant 
      Journal</I>, this clairvoyant writing produces a third position that 
      declares a certain indifference between opposites. 
      <P align=justify>Having established the indifference of difference, Weiner 
      links it to clairvoyance, the indeterminate phenomenon of seeing words 
      both there and not there. In fact, Weiner's understanding of the words on 
      the page as indeterminate seems itself the effect of their having been 
      routed through clairvoyance, which announces writing as a strange species 
      of catachrestical translation or metaphor: "words SEEING myname" (7). 
      Having crossed through the threshold of clairvoyance, the poem carries the 
      clairvoyant imprimatur. This writing is not "about," but a repetitive act 
      of writing "myname," of inscribing an indeterminate self.<SUP><A

      name=REF34>34</A></SUP> For Weiner, the fact that "I still did see it with 
      my right Hannah name" (7) invisibly separates and testifies to the 
      properness, the radical particularity of this clairvoyant form of naming 
      from "thename schoolwork," the name as a generalized function. Yet Weiner 
      also expresses as she begins the piece that to write "my bicycle" "this 
      hurts." Her name, her writing, is inevitably mistakable for "IMBECILLIC 
      WRITING" (7), writing that in being written becomes recognizable, 
      painfully conscripted within the pale of the general. There can be no 
      indeterminate mark. Although the clairvoyant self, as yet impossibly 
      unreflexive, may be indeterminate, there is only access to it through a 
      writing that posits a determinate center, a "zero one." 
      <P align=justify>Given her political commitments, however, it was of the 
      utmost importance to Weiner that she continue, unflaggingly, to generate 
      tactics for conveying indeterminacy without damaging it. <I>All</I> of 
      Weiner's later work involves the delicate and complicated task of aligning 
      this precariously poised indefinite quality with the representation of 
      Native Americans in the political sphere. From a thematic standpoint, 
      Weiner's poetry shows that she remained an outspoken supporter of the aim 
      movement: the work reminds its readers of the imprisonment of aim leaders 
      Peltier and Russell Means (who was arrested, tried, and jailed a number of 
      times, as well as shot by a Bureau of Indian Affairs policeman [Sayer 
      213]), and of the ongoing Indian struggles for religious freedom and 
      economic and territorial parity. Weiner's poetry maintains its vigilance 
      long after the media circus surrounding the 1970s trials for movement 
      standoffs with various federal agencies had died out. Weiner was also a 
      friend of the Oglala Sioux Crow Dog family of which Leonard Crow Dog, a 
      holy man active at the landmark 1973 protest at Wounded Knee and 
      subsequent events, had been jailed, and Mary Crow Dog, also involved 
      <B>[End Page 150]</B> in key aim protests including the 1972 Trail of 
      Broken Treaties, was to write a groundbreaking feminist autobiography, 
      <I>Lakota Woman</I>.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT35" 
      name=REF35>35</A></SUP> Just as important, however, is the fact that 
      Weiner never loses sight of the formal conditions of representation that 
      allow such gross injustice towards and expropriation of indigenous groups 
      to take place seemingly without the possibility of just recourse. The 
      textual logic drawn out through her poetry allegorizes the political logic 
      that produces Native Americans as a subaltern constituency. 
      <P align=justify>Although Weiner's work has been read as "comprised of 
      very little other than broken bits of language," in which "syntax is 
      unsystematically eroded, as is orthography, proper word order, etc" 
      (Damon, Sect. 1), her entire project is one of "correcting for 
      correction," a practice that involves every mark in a double accounting. A 
      meticulous commentary on hegemony's syntactical discipline is accompanied 
      by the constant invention of disarticulations that permit her text to 
      glimpse an impossible presentation of alterity: "this wor section these 
      words are inflicted upon by us who / writes in the uneven indent which / 
      signifies us / I was prepared to fight" (<I>Spoke</I> 72).<SUP><A

      name=REF36>36</A></SUP> Weiner grapples with establishing a turnabout for 
      that which definitionally exceeds representation "as though this goal were 
      not utopian but pragmatic" (Felman 211). The stakes of clairvoyant writing 
      are twofold: what would remain indeterminate reaches the representational 
      field always already conscripted by determining forces; this preinscribed 
      history belongs to the victors, who establish a differential between 
      indifferent abstract differences. Weiner finds that the very act of 
      witnessing, even as it occurs in clairvoyant writing, "appears to work in 
      another's interest" (Spivak, "Can" 276), for it not only employs the 
      dominant idiom, but in its very appearance as writing disqualifies itself 
      from giving testimony.<SUP><A

      name=REF37>37</A></SUP> Developing a number of ingenious means of 
      protecting the necessarily foreclosed indefiniteness of her text from both 
      indeterminacy and overdetermination in its appearance in a restricted 
      economy, Weiner exhibits an extreme sensitivity to the burden of 
      representation that is irreducibly <I>both</I> metonymic in the sphere of 
      politics <I>and</I> ambiguously metaphoric in the sphere of exchange 
      ("Can" 276-79). Chasing after, rather than denying the contradictions--and 
      the risks--involved, Weiner's overarching strategy is to write what she 
      theorizes can be only a <I>metaphorically silent</I> text. 
      <P align=justify>Weiner analyzes the double bind of representation in 
      which native leaders find their being silenced impossible to remark in 
      "UBLIMINAL" <B>[End Page 151]</B> (1997), abducting and reinscribing these 
      confrontations with hegemony within the economy of a metaphorical silence 
      that "a i m leadership" has "under control":

      <P align=justify>On the one hand, to claim "correct identity" is not only 
      to fall within the totalizing scheme of a disciplinary measure ("sir"), it 
      is also to become "territory inclined," marking a "laughable" or 
      indifferent opposition within which the proper antiproperty stance of 
      Indian tenement squatters is radically absent. As Weiner points out, the 
      objective is not to act as lessor or lessee, but to "unlease." On the 
      other hand, even though it is already inscribed within an opposition that 
      twists it to make it a form of consent, silent speaking or writing may 
      nevertheless become "perfect perfection," knowable as a "secret division," 
      a "scrambled" message that points back to the "original opposition" 
      between the indefinite and indifferent difference. 
      <P align=justify>Yet, even as she comments on the fragile mechanism of a 
      metaphorically silent speech (marking this silence with a physical space 
      in the passage above), Weiner maintains a painstaking awareness that 
      speaking requires a rhetorical position from which to speak, the 
      production of which must inevitably recapitulate hegemony's own tactics. 
      She aligns this preordained conflation with the acknowledgement of a 
      similarly structured ambiguity: that in her extreme identification with 
      the Native American cause she risks "the slippage from rendering visible 
      the mechanism to rendering vocal the individual" (Spivak, "Can" 285)--the 
      danger of ventriloquizing the subaltern.<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT38" 
      name=REF38>38</A></SUP> Although clairvoyance would provide the mechanism 
      by which the anti-author is befallen by her text, thus demolishing "all 
      questions of agency or the agent's connection with [her] interest" ("Can" 
      278), Weiner signals that interest does inevitably figure in any 
      recognizable text--indeed, she forces to the reader's attention the 
      ethical injunction to flip this interest metaphorically in favor of what 
      lies beyond evidence. As she writes, for instance, in <I>Nijole's 
      House</I>: <B>[End Page 152]</B> "ALLS IN SILENCE SPOKEN and / obeyed 
      because we change the / society" (9). This explicit solicitation of the 
      reader's credulity credits the presupposition of belief to the 
      (non)account of absolute difference. And it must do so without positing 
      the reader's anticipatory knowledge of what interest this reversal serves. 
      This is difficult to manage because it requires both bridging and 
      maintaining the discrepancy between a meaning unconditioned by mensuration 
      and the ineradicable, indeed necessary, figuration of exchange. In staging 
      the author's compelling and the reader's compulsion through a trope that 
      solicits credibility yet remains beyond belief, i.e., <I>clairvoyance</I>, 
      Weiner aims not at representational accuracy, but at ethical adequacy; not 
      the authority of experience, but the experience of alterity as an 
      alternate and indefinite authority. No slippage between a necessary 
      "speaking for" and an impossible "speaking as" is permitted, for Weiner 
      stages ventriloquism as a "speaking for" that painfully and pragmatically 
      replaces an unrepresentable "speaking as" only once that throwing of voice 
      is metaphorically guided by an alternate ought. As Weiner says in 
      <I>LITTLE BOOKS/INDIANS</I>, her text is to be the figure of this tenuous 
      conjoining: "I ams ampersand / THIS BOOK TESTS / YOU / I'SM SCARED" (35). 
      <P align=justify>Weiner's concern both to refuse and enact this 
      representational slippage by writing in an economy of silence is reflected 
      in her creation of an anti-apostrophe in <I>LITTLE BOOKS/INDIANS</I>, 
      where she implodes the disciplinarity of voice by inflecting apostrophe as 
      a mark of punctuation: "'s apostrophe voice - I SKIP" (28). If in 
      <I>Clairvoyant Journal</I>, voice established differential and difference, 
      the rigorous removal of nearly every punctuating apostrophe, a practice 
      that would continue in all of her other books, disarticulates this coding 
      literally: "Hannah you're / making a mistake / again / dumbMISTA / 
      apostrophe / nos / sign" (53). A mark appearing in exactly the same form 
      in its three highly different uses, the clitic form of auxiliary word 
      groups (primarily modal verbs and the present tense of the verb "to be"), 
      the possessive case, and the contracted negative (most often found in 
      Weiner's work in the imperative), the apostrophe, as that which adds, 
      subtracts, and endows with a modality of being, becomes an emblem of a 
      seemingly uniform or equitable structure that covertly determines and 
      apportions value, the text itself refusing to become value's scene. 
      <P align=justify> Weiner connects this absented apostrophe to an errant 
        "s" that announces the textual field as silent (see <A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman_fig04.html">fig. 
        4</A>). An "s" is added to what <B>[End Page 153]</B> should be first-person 
        verb forms, effectively leveling them with the third-person verbs: "i 
        ams a dis / CIPLINE" (14), "I writes / SLOWLY" (10); she puts a stray 
        "s" at the beginning of nouns, creating a sign that equivocates between 
        a kind of inverse pluralization and possession, "SHEALERS" (34); she replaces 
        the apostrophe of the contracted negative with an "s": "I donst object 
        / S E N T E N C E / SENTENCE / sSLOWLY / I writes" (10); "I CANST / EXPLAIN 
        / JIMMIE / TO MY / MIND AGAIN" (56), as well as the apostrophe marking 
        the clitic "to be": "IsM." As Weiner remarks, "shannah I worries / MYSELF 
        / t/o/s death" (9)--"Hannah I am just / an injustice / leveller" (31). 
      <P align=justify>Managing the reversal of a textual field in which "there 
      is a great / master among us / that we are / against" (48) and making it 
      yield to an alternate "ought" is extremely difficult. The remarkable 
      opening pages of <I>LITTLE BOOKS/INDIANS</I> make the argument that every 
      written <I>letter</I> carries with it the burden of hegemonic recognition 
      or "STRUCTURE."<SUP><A

      name=REF39>39</A></SUP> It matters little whether the writer seems 
      present: "SEE an n appears / <B>[End Page 154]</B> sWHERE / where I write 
      / N/WRITTEN / completes my sentence" (11), or vacates the scene: "I just / 
      DISAPPEAR / sSometime" (11), as the machinery of closure absorbs these 
      infinitesimal units of sense. The smallest mark--"cross my ts"--registers 
      "structure ONS SCREEN stupid," whether the writer objects or not: "I donst 
      object" (10). The writer need not even remember this fact of totalization: 
      "I FORGOTS MY / SCREEN / I completes my SEN/ENCE" (11 final virgule in 
      original) or forgets to finish a mark completely, for just upon entering 
      the scene of representation: "I ENCLOSE MY / SOBVI / OUS // S" (10). The 
      closure of the page as screen cheats: "COLOR TV / As LIE" (12). The letter 
      may be an accidental death, but one on which structural recuperation puts 
      a premium and registers as a "double indemnity" (17). At the same time, 
      however, Weiner is establishing the pure contingency of the mark beyond 
      such determining structure: "sThis / I am ACROSS / still swaiting" (9). 
      She is caught between a compulsion to complete and repeat, "self a sheep" 
      (13), and a counterdemand that would acknowledge the structure as open to 
      a radically heterogeneous motive that is purely a means unwitting of its 
      end: "WHO KNO / W S YELLOW / WHA / TT / evils / sheep followers / LURKS / 
      Just TYPE" (13). 
      <P align=justify>Although the recursive force of determination remains a 
      constant threat, Weiner's poems are unrelentingly pragmatic in attempting 
      to establish this reversal. Indeed, Wiener's pragmatism--"correctly / ohs 
      hannah SPEL / b/e/s/m/o/r/e/p/r/a/c / tical" (44)--leads her to the 
      eventuality of meaning, to the necessity of fighting force with force, 
      "hannah forgot / STRUCTURE / ins my SILENCE / S E N T E N C E / I may just 
      become / Jimmie scribbles" (45). She states:

      <P align=justify>Playing on the name of Russell Means, Weiner attempts to 
      deploy a meaning that would still claim a connection with silence, that 
      would be "honest" despite its ambiguous vehicularity and potential to 
      harm. Even as she creates carefully demarcated zones in which the 
      subaltern contingent may establish its own mechanisms of closure, "it 
      Russell leads period," and models of a just correcting for correction, 
      "spells awkwardly," Weiner notes the pain of determination: "and it hurts 
      a little published." Only with extreme care does she venture to write the 
      proper name, signaling its connection to alterity by writing it in 
      reverse: "LLESSUR SNAME." Weiner restricts this recourse to determinacy 
      due solely to the extreme repression of an external silencing, "he sits / 
      SILENT / &amp; we know it," so that it functions purely as an indicator of 
      that double bind: "hannah thats all silence means." 
      <P align=justify>Producing a metaphorically silent textual field also 
      requires a theory of metaphor that allows for the detour into alterity. 
      Description produces abstraction as it metaphorizes its objects in order 
      to make them knowable; it is thus also precisely what makes any object 
      improper to itself in becoming meaningful. Given that conceptual 
      predication is metaphorical in its structure, writing becomes silent only 
      when its metaphoricity remains at "the stage when meaning has appeared but 
      when truth still might be missed" (Derrida, "White" 241)--that is, only 
      when the negation metaphor entails does not return vehicle to tenor and 
      thus sublate the negation. 
      <P align=justify>Weiner traces the movements of this impossible refusal of 
      return in "Research Important Conflict Two Obedient" (1990), her staccato, 
      elliptical style isolating the moments she analyzes: "forget sentence 
      structure repetition your forget remorse begins on the wherever 
      subconstruction intelligent read uncomplish permit granted substitution 
      unoffended have substance without understanding" (70). The mark that would 
      escape the violence of metaphor, foregoing predicative structure in order 
      to designate what repels it, repeats the structure's inherent forgetting 
      of particularity, its basic metaphoricity: "forget sentence structure 
      <B>[End Page 156]</B> repetition your forget." Yet it is possible to read 
      the metaphor trying to forget itself, to "uncomplish" itself (a negative 
      asymmetrical to "accomplish"), "wherever subconstruction intelligence 
      read." The "permit" is "granted" to enter the outside and in becoming part 
      of the very outside, the substitution is "unoffended" by itself. It 
      becomes possible for it to "have substance without understanding," that 
      is, without falling into a predicative, metaphorical structure of 
      differential commonality. It obeys, as Derrida writes, "the law of what 
      does not return or come back, of what comes back to us only there where it 
      can no longer come back to us" ("By Force" 192). 
      <P align=justify>Weiner states that the mode of writing that would 
      "uncomplish" as perpetual "remorse" is always at risk of being formally 
      "forgiven" and thus falling into an economy inscribing its determinacy; it 
      becomes an abstract vehicle invoking and thus harboring its opposite: 
      <P align=justify>

      <P align=justify>Even a blank does not avoid the problem of language 
      "cheating," since the "omitted sentence" actually "repeats meaning" 
      through its formal opposition to text. It is recuperated as "work," while 
      "the outside [is] the absence of work" (Blanchot 33). A truly responsible 
      "silence" is "recommended," but it is not writable: either one writes 
      reliably and creates the hollow of the negation of this negation, an 
      "unfilled publishing," or one is "unable" to write at all and allows the 
      name to become "destructible." Even one's "own you" is a "reference" taken 
      up in a "continuum" with "some" form of descriptive "rationalism," already 
      involved in closure as "obstruction," unable to designate alterity. 
      Already completed and repeated as though upon a rational model it 
      implicitly follows, the "sentence" is "like obedience like someone 
      obediently construction obedience." It would seem impossible to make any 
      progress in recovery; one can only trace or reiterate an alterity that 
      resists and yet is also further harmed by this resistance. 
      <P align=justify>Weiner then inverts the problem: <B>[End Page 157]</B> 
      <P align=justify>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract--><I>say its history write substructure

        another quit handling sis Im quitting like omit translate your name quit 
        reading climax forbidden (72)</I> <!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify>It is possible for silence to "say its history" if 
      remorse, ("I'm sorry)" is expressed and unrecuperated ("your incomplete 
      structure"). Yet what would fall out of dialectical recovery is 
      "forbidden"; it becomes an obvious aberration if it is not possessed 
      through this repossession ("someone say name controls otherwise quarrel"). 
      Thus, a translated name must be given, but not read over, not speculated 
      upon. The silence this negative name establishes is fragile. 
      <P align=justify>Weiner thus outlines in "Research Important" that silent 
      writing requires two interdependent elements: that it keep its "incomplete 
      structure" and that it express not description, but "obedience like only 
      prescription" (70 see above). She repeatedly emphasizes the importance of 
      interruption in her composition process: "Many of these words and 
      sentences were completed if my memory could hold onto the long seen phrase 
      which was interrupted by newer seen phrases" ("Mostly" 56); "The words 
      appeared too fast and interrupted themselves. The (my) natural desire for 
      closure was defeated by the more important mind--or poetic--form" 
      ("Mostly" 55). The similarly structured indeterminate relation 
      characterizes the reading process: 
      <P align=justify>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract--><I>The incomplete and interrupted sentence 
        does away again with the authority of the author, engaging the reader 
        whose own mind will either naturally or by art respond to the delay of 
        the interruptions and the incompleteness. Perhaps the reader, even, is 
        not allowed a consistent or ego-building response. ("Mostly" 66)</I> <!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify>Any exchange requires interruption, as Blanchot argues, 
      for purposes of establishing common ground (76). But before the movement 
      of chiasmus seals exchange, "what is in play now is the foreignness 
      between us" (77). Like Weiner's characterization of reading as a 
      collaborative process, Blanchot proposes that interruption may enable 
      dialogue, but also that it is possible for speakers to "allow 
      intermittence itself to speak" (78). Rather than dialectically affirming 
      commonality, "they speak in order to <B>[End Page 158]</B> make speech 
      speak as difference" (441 n2), as when Weiner proposes that neither author 
      nor reader establishes determinate closure. The difference that 
      interruption acknowledges connects to an alterity within speech itself. 
      "There is a fundamental anomaly that falls to speech not to reduce but to 
      convey . . . it is to this hiatus--to the strangeness, to the infinity 
      between us--that the interruption in language itself responds" (Blanchot 
      77). Such a silent anomaly becomes discernible in Weiner's texts, for if 
      as medium/mediation, writing is the radical forgetting of this 
      particularity, Weiner's silent writing, in its literal and figurative 
      palimpsestic form, holds the possibility of remembering what did not 
      determinately occur. To be dominated involves the loss of the capacity to 
      determine events, giving rise to an indeterminacy that circulates around 
      the actual indifference between determinate difference effects. For 
      Weiner, this alterity exerts an invisible pressure in writing, a pressure 
      that interruption can make apparent. Interruption makes evident that 
      radical difference the trace structure entails and its inhabitation by an 
      indefinite alternate history. Remarking that "interruption . . . is not 
      necessarily or simply marked by silence, by a blank or a gap . . . but by 
      a change in the form or the structure of language" (77), Blanchot also 
      anticipates Weiner's other concern: that silence somehow avoid existential 
      predication. Silence does so precisely by changing form, eliminating 
      description in becoming "like only prescriptive." The radical exteriority 
      to which writing may point is what exceeds the metaphorical enfolding of 
      description; it is another mode of relation entirely. 
      <P align=justify>Interruption signals or silently writes the anomaly 
      Lyotard, drawing on Kant, terms "obligation": "this imminent phrase, 
      unable to be formulated in a description, is marked or announced as a 
      partial silence, as a feeling, a respect" (121).<SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/differences/v012/12.2goldman.html#FOOT40" 
      name=REF40>40</A></SUP> Obligation, too, is a species of performative; as 
      Lyotard explains, it is a spontaneous cause "allomorphic" to diachronic 
      determinate experience that acts as a premise authorizing "a phrase that 
      asserts freedom" (120). Obligation, however, is to be distinguished from a 
      regular performative or imperative because it declares an absolute 
      heterogeneity between issuing and receiving parties. Unlike the Kantian 
      categorical imperative, it is not formulated with respect to any actual 
      ability on the part of the addressee and does not synthesize nature and 
      freedom: "To the <I>You ought to</I> then there corresponds . . . an <I>I 
      am able to</I> and not a <I>You are able to</I>. This <I>I am able to</I> 
      is not a phrase that links onto the <I>You ought to</I> by way of an 
      entity which would be selfsame" (122). Occurring in the space of 
      interruption, this ethical relation bridging <B>[End Page 159]</B> radical 
      difference announces the copresence of obligation and a response 
      characterized by its freedom, its pure potentiality of effect. Though this 
      act, Lyotard notes, would seem immediately circumscribed by a judgment 
      assessing its possibility through a determinate experiential measure, 
      Weiner suggests otherwise, holding onto potentiality by destroying this 
      determining, norming assessment: "Sis destroy meaning unsubstantially so 
      direct by intuition youre honest scribbling" ("Research Important" 70). 
      "Research Important Conflict Two Obedient" is Weiner's analytical research 
      into the "conflict" between two structures of obedience, an ethical 
      obligation that establishes a relation to alterity and a "'universal law 
      of nature'" (Kant's phrase) that explicitly disregards this "dissymmetry" 
      "for the benefit of some universal, 'humanity,' the we of exchangeable I's 
      and you's" (Lyotard 125). 
      <P align=justify>Weiner stages the "insensible" (a quasi fact of 
      intuition, rather than sensibility) obligation giving rise to the poem, 
      which in turn instantiates an impossible potentiality, in an address in 
      <I>Spoke</I> to "the Indian reader": 
      <P align=justify>
      <P align=justify>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>[End Page 160]</B> 
      <P align=justify>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify>As Weiner writes, normative obedience precludes the 
      intimations of obligation as a heterogeneous first cause: "don't drive in 
      the front car ever as the subway l/e/s/i/o/n." "The front car" leads to a 
      "lesion," the wounding separation of absolute difference and the painful 
      coercion of ethical obligation. The demand is effectively "incontestable," 
      since obligation cannot be tested and thus contested. By means of the 
      figurative interchange of clairvoyance, Weiner conjoins the "Speaker on 
      the whole on the front / front / page," "who is impossible as a leader," 
      the source from whom the alternate authority of absolute difference 
      issues, with the pure potentiality of the indefinite that answers that 
      call: "who cares if the impossible / can be done." Weiner further imagines 
      that the poem confounds "the liver the poor abstract / reader who has 
      lesson about the thinking / class who is the ruler," the reader who would 
      norm the ethical relation of difference and become the measure, the 
      "ruler," of the universal law, rather than acceding to the silent 
      "leader." Unlike a "subordinate / clause / leader / clause," Weiner acts 
      with freedom, herself becoming "inclausible." Indeed, the poem as 
      potentiality becomes the surrogate for the "Speaker": "I was a leader." 
      The poem itself battles for this alternate law in its subjunctive history: 
      "battle sis it has to be recognized as a great big leader in its own 
      time," but it does so without mastery, without the eventuality of an end, 
      and without claiming totalizing knowledge of the one who obligates, "who 
      has hints to the march is in with it." Integrating the ephemeral 
      experience of smoking a cigarette into this intuited temporality, Weiner 
      closes the clairvoyant rendezvous with alterity by noting an event 
      determinate in its absence: "and Charles whoname didnt call / with a 
      period." The writing only ends because of this determined closure. 
      <P align=justify>At its most fundamental, Weiner's writing remarks and 
      metaphorically effaces the self in order to write its secret ethical name, 
      a name that would mark the pure potential of each moment: "I'S SSHOULDNT / 
      101. secret name / writes as it is as it is" (<I>LITTLE BOOKS</I> 48). It 
      is a name <B>[End Page 161]</B> stumbled upon through an interruptive 
      relation, a "squinting" second sight: "hannah stops / writing it in / 
      BEFORE / hannah is you a / psychic squinting / as it is / QUESTION" (57). 
      For Weiner, the importance of this "QUESTION" lies ultimately in whether 
      being "psychic" enables the creation of an indefinite sentence whose 
      interest inheres in a radical form of democracy. Her poetry itself leads 
      us to one answer: perhaps only a clairvoyant can make writing silently 
      tell a truth that cannot be written.

      cheap apartment" (<I>silent teachers</I> 69) on the lower east side of 
      Manhattan, Weiner also had her "day jobs": shortly after graduating from 
      Radcliffe College in 1950, she moved to New York and, in succession, 
      worked for three publishing houses, took a position as an assistant 
      clothing buyer at Bloomingdale's, and became a lingerie designer 
      (Bernstein, "Hannah"; Weiner, <I>silent teachers</I> 69).

      name=FOOT9>9</A> Weiner's numerous performance works throughout the 1960s 
      generally involved disarticulating the conventions of cultural forms and 
      social experiences. One example is the legendary "Fashion Show Poetry 
      Event" of 1970 that she organized with poets Eduardo Costa and John 
      Perreault, for which they enlisted a number of artists--Andy Warhol and 
      Claes Oldenburg, among others--to design costumes, while the three poets 
      wrote a poetry program to accompany the ventures down the catwalk. 
      (Apparently, Weiner herself, using her experience as a designer, also 
      created a costume--"an all-purpose, many pocketed cape . . . : no need for 
      luggage when you fly" [Perreault 8]).

      name=FOOT11>11</A> As Perreault remembers of the 60s period, "Hannah 
      Weiner was best known for her code poem performances. One night she had 
      two people waving flags at each other from one end of West 26th Street to 
      the other. I remember her Central Park band-shell spectacle that included 
      flares, flags, and Coast Guards" (8). The pieces were not only performed 
      live in various arts festivals and art-activism events protesting the 
      Vietnam War; a production of "Any Chance of War," was made into a film, 
      and other texts appeared in a number of gallery venues and journals.

      woman writer is more likely to suggest in her work that [the gender bias

      maintain their linguistic influence and claims to objectivity by 
      reinforcing gender categories and definitions" (9).

      this time who are mentioned in the journal include Jerome Rothenberg, 
      Bernadette Mayer, Jackson Mac Low, Kathy Acker, LaMonte Young, and Phillip 
      Glass, to name only a few. Weiner attended the meditation retreats of 
      Swami Satchidananda, a Hindu master of hatha yoga who founded Integral 
      Yoga International in Manhattan, and lectures given by Chogyam Trungpa 
      Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist lama who founded Naropa University in 
      Boulder, Colorado. Approximately the last quarter of <I>Clairvoyant

      name=FOOT15>15</A> To cite Weiner's clairvoyant and even her 
      nonclairvoyant writings in prose format is inevitably to alter them. I 
      have tried to indicate wherever possible when the text presents a word on 
      the diagonal by using the line break symbol between letters without 
      spacing; because these chop up words, they are fairly differentiable from 
      Weiner's own line breaks. As will be discussed, Weiner often employs 
      unconventional orthograhy. Her spelling has been preserved in quoted 
      passages in this essay.

      as De-Facement," "Autobiography . . . [is] a figure of reading or of 
      understanding that occurs to some degree in all texts. The 
      autobiographical moment happens as an alignment between the two subjects 
      involved in the process of reading in which they determine each other by 
      mutual reflexive substitution" (70).

      name=FOOT18>18</A> Mayer's "Experiments," actually a collaboration done 
      with students from one of her writing workshops at the Poetry Project, is

      name=FOOT19>19</A> Clairvoyance even ironizes as it estranges this 
      substituting function, as it becomes, like belief, contagious, spreading 
      to situations where our uniqueness would seem necessary: "SECRET says 
      Donnie's forehead / Michael's face appears on mine making love to Donnie

      irresolvable ambiguity arises when one attempts to distinguish between the 
      power that (transitively) enacts the subject, and the power enacted by the 
      subject. . . . At some point, a reversal and concealment occurs, and power 
      is what belongs exclusively to the subject" (15).

      sometimes extremely disjointed significations. The sentence, though, has 
      one unique meaning, what I mean is that it can't be lexicalised--one makes 
      dictionaries of words, of word usages or locutions, but one doesn't make a 
      dictionary of sentences. Hence, some of the ambiguities tied to the 
      semantic element are reabsorbed in the context, through usage and the 
      utterance of the sentence" (<I>Seminar</I> 279).

      name=FOOT24>24</A> The future-oriented redirection that Weiner 
      orchestrates emphasizes the indefinite quality shared by blank and text. 
      In this, it employs the same structure of the promise of form Werner 
      Hamacher isolates in Marx's critique of the commodity fetish: "This 
      promise says that language other than commodity language is possible . . . 
      it says that . . . something other than a categorical language will be 
      invented. This promise is itself already no longer a category; it 
      indicates something structurally different" (Hamacher 180).
