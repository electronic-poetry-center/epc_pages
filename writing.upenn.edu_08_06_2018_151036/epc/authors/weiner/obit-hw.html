<p>

I have very sad news to report. Hannah Weiner has died. Word of her
unexpected death reached me late last night. Apparently she died of natural
causes in her apartment on East 12th street in Manhattan.  
<A name="hannahmeant"></A> Hannah meant so
very much to me and I know to many other poets who were lucky enough to
have known her and her inspiring and courageous work, her enthusiastic
engagement with writing, her brilliant and acute (and often wickedly funny)
perspectives on poets and poetry, her incredible performances. While her
last few years weren't easy, she continued to produce amazing writing,
pushing her own poetry and the possibilities for poetry into new zones of
perception. <P>

Hannah would have turned 69 on November 4. <P>

I include here a bibliography of her work that I compiled a few years
ago.  It may not include some of her 
most recent pieces. There is also a LINEbreak interview with
Hannah available via the Electronic Poetry Center (EPC) as well as a
one hour radio show (with readings and an interview), produced by
Ernesto Grosman, that is also up at the EPC. <P>

thanks charles for this sad news. tho i never met her her work came to
mean
a lot to me the moment i opened Spoke (thanks to your suggestion that
i
look into her work). out of shyness, i had been stalling sending her a
copy
of my essay on her, which she'd heard about and asked for last
february.
i've still got the pink stationery letter from her in my "to do" pile
right
by the computer.  now she's become the silent teacher she had been in
training for all these years, and i bet we'll continue to be surprised
at
how she enters our lives. <P>

This is truly a shock to the whole poetry community.
I will be posting a wonderful story written by Hannah
tomorrow morning or late this afternoon in tribute to
this wonderful exploratory poet. Hannah's was certainly
one of the most original contributions to American poetry
ever. Her work was like no one else's, and its ability
to combine the personal and linguistic experimentation
should serve as a beacon to all those who mistakenly
feel there is a split between self-expression and intellectual
pursuits. <P>

The posts from Charles Bernstein, Ron Silliman, Maria Damon, [Charles
Alexander] and Douglas Messerli together speak volumes--from the
starkness of Ron's announcement to the informative currency of
Charles', to the keen insight of Douglas's observation that in her one
found the personal and the linguistically challenging all of a
piece...and to the poignancy of Maria's unanswered letter. It is sad
to look for the last time, even sadder not to have done so. I extend
my sympathies to Charles, who was I know close to Hannah for many
years. And I can certainly overlap with Maria's feelings, for Hannah
was a person I took to immediately & was looking forward to seeing
when in New York next month--but with whom I did not get around to
corresponding. <P>

At least, we have her work (and more I hope will now be made available),
and Douglas (one of her publishers--courageous publishers, one has to add,
for her poetry remained a rigorous & unpredictable series of challenges) 
put his finger on the pulse of it in his tribute. An absolute original. 
What a loss to us. <P>

I hate death/now she's out of it.  Dear Hannah Weiner. <P>

Hannah Weiner<BR>
(1928-1997)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

_________________________<BR>
<BR>

 
This year has been one of losing writers -- 
<a href="../../documents/obits/ginsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</a>,
William Burroughs, Alan Harrington, and more.  I think it's important to
note that some great losses don't involve the most famous names. In any
generation, many writers who do not become well known may be remembered
decades or centuries later as the most interesting of their time. I tend
to believe that for every Emily Dickinson recovered into our collective
memory, there are probably several very fine writers who are not found. 

<P> One of the most important writers of our time, in my opinion, although
not one of the most famous, has just died -- word reached me this morning
that Hannah Weiner was found in her apartment, on East 12th Street in
Manhattan, dead of natural causes. she would have been 69 years old on
November 4. As a fellow poet, Charles Bernstein, 
<A HREF="obit-hw.html#hannahmeant">wrote in a note,</A> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Hannah meant so very much to me and I know to many other poets who were lucky
enough to have known her and her inspiring and courageous work, her

wickedly funny)  perspectives on poets and poetry, her incredible

produce amazing writing, pushing her own poetry and the possibilities for
poetry into new zones of perception."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Hannah wrote to me a few months ago, on a postcard with a photograph
of a very young Bob Dylan, that New York was getting more difficult,
wondering what it was like to live in Arizona, whether she should move
here. I hadn't answered all of those questions yet, thinking there was a
world of time. 

<P>
Hannah saw words everywhere. She and her particular vision are missed
-- immediately . . . and always.

Anyone who is interested might want to check out Mark DuCharme's brillaint
discussion of Hannah Weiner in the latest issue of *6ix* magazine.  Among
other things, he reads her psychic ability as a kind of "trope" for the
way in which "all writing is in some sense *perceived*, stolen,
appropriated." 

<P>
He ends the essay by arguing that her "neutralization of the distinction
between public and private experience -- between ordinary
language/ordinary consciousness, and the poetic, is coterminous with her
desire to neutralize the distinction between poetry and . . . exterior
life."  Such a utopian possibility is enormously appealing -- at least for
me. 

<P>
Also, Weiner's poem "Silent History" in 
*<A HREF="../../mags/chain.html">Chain</A>* 4 is yet another
persuasive reason to check out that magazine.  <P>

I first met Hannah on my first literary trip east of the Mississippi,
circa 1980, at an opening as I recall of a show of Lee Sherry's. I was in
the midst of telling Lee how much I liked the work when Hannah walked up,
paused for a moment, declared in something akin to a stage whisper "It
says 'go away'" and stalked off, offended. My eyes dilated, I tracked her
down and got that straightened out. It was the first -- and last --
argument we ever had. And from it grew a friendship that, like her
writing, was simply impossible to duplicate.

<!-- P --> 
Hannah would call maybe once a month (more often during the bad times),
sometimes insisting that I had "told" her to call (especially if she was
calling at an inconvenient time of night). We would discuss her latest
problems, which often had to do with the American Indian Movement or
various publishers, my kids, readings, friends, her interest in music (she
was a 60s folk rock fan), whatever. Depending on how she was doing at the
time, the calls could range anywhere from absolutely straightforward to
utterly impossible.

<P>
Hannah was as insecure as any writer on this list, but for her this never
came out as worrying about this or that revision -- she had absolute
confidence in her writing practice-- but instead in her publications. I
always felt that her paranoia about whether this or that publisher was
going to slight her work, especially through delays was more pronounced
since, not working and with no immediate family, publishing literally was
her life -- even moreso as she became more and more reclusive. While I had
a completely easy time with her and her work in In the American Tree (in
sharp contrast with a couple of folks), it seemed apparent, from her
accounts as well as theirs, that Hannah was an absolute terror to her book
publishers. All of them are to be praised for the infinite patience it
must have required to complete each book. 

<P>
In the mid-80s, Hannah came to California and stayed with Krishna and I in
San Francisco as we gave readings at the Arts Commission Gallery and in
Mill Valley. It was her first trip west and we were prepared to show her
all the sights, but she had no interest whatever in going outside once she
was at our house. Getting her to and from the readings was work enough.
(This was before either Krishna or I had learned how to drive, so it was
all public transit.) Afterwards, I realized that I'd learned in an
unspoken way just how disorienting and even frightening the external world
had become for her.  She was profoundly interested in it, but was very
protective of her psyche and quite conscious of her limits. She was a
remarkably quiet guest during those few days. In fact, I probably received
phone calls in which she said more than she did while at our house. 

<P>
Hannah was very interested in kids, especially in the idea of having boys. 
At various points, Asa Watten, Ben Sherry, Felix Bernstein and my son
Jesse were all identified by her as "silent teachers." While she and Jesse
spoke on the phone a few times and he's heard the works that refer to him,
they never got to meet in person. 

<P>
I was raised by a grandmother who was psychotic and don't take the
circumstance lightly. When Hannah was on her meds, she could be remarkably
matter of fact about her own situation, but often she was not on her meds
and they tend to be the sorts of things that can get mixed and muddled too
easily. When, in the 60s, psychiatry in this country moved literally
millions of people out of institutions back into communities, there was an
assumption (even stated boldly in places such as California) that local
governments would set up the resources to support them. I know from my
experience in the Tenderloin that, with help, it's not that difficult. (My
wife did this for a living for years with many clients in far worse shape
than Hannah.) I often felt that Hannah would have benefited greatly from a
program such as the one Krishna had worked in. Now I wonder if she might
not still be alive if it had existed for her. It's not a fun thought. 

<P>
I've written about Hannah's work before, so won't duplicate that here, but
I do want to note that when I used the word "realism" in the subtitle of
Tree and as the title of a selection of langpo in Ironwood, it was
Hannah's work specifically that brought me to this realization. She was an
awesome documentarian of a minority reality and if you read her use of
pauses, punctuation (including half-erased lettering), and multiple
voices, you discover both how complex and completely realized her texts
are. 

<P>
I miss her terribly,

<P>

Saddened by news of old, old friend Hannah.  We met in '64 in Kenneth
Koch's New School poetry workshop.  She was even then thinking of
alternative poetries, and when she visited me the following year in Spain
during my expatriate number she'd already begun to draft out Code of Flag
Behavior in which I performed as a signal man at G Stern's loft in the
late sixties.  Many memories now, not only of her highly original poetry
but of her sweetness, her generosity and the exercise wherever possible of
her canny and genuine zaniness.  <P>

When with Hannah Wiener you knew you would be recognized for what you

My condolences to Charles Bernstein & others who were close to Hannah
Weiner.  Over the past ten or twelve years, I taught Hannah's writing in
my contemporary poetry classes, and I corresponded a bit with her about
her writing and about teaching her work.  Initially, her writing would
evoke great skepticism (particularly among the graduate students in
creative writing).  Of course, we found various analogous writings in our
immediate surroundings--mystic script writing of a number of folk artists,
for example (JB Murry, the Reverend Perkins, Howard Finster, Fred Webster,
and so on).  Others have commented on the fusion of the personal and the
experimental in Hannah's writing;  I was also struck by the politics of
it, especially with regard to Native American activism.  Once in my life,
I was invited to read in NCY, and did so at The Ear Inn.  I was absolutely
thrilled when Hannah introduced herself to me.  When I was teaching her
work, at some point the intensity and vulnerability of her word-vision
experience hit me, and continues to hit me....  In many ways, she has
helped me to see words in ways I had not known before.

Roof Books published Hannah's last book: _We Speak Silent_ in 1996. Hannah
had been ill off and on for a few years, but no one expected her death. 
She came to a reading of mine as recently as May 1997 and was vigorous if
distracted. She was a wonder and a trial to me for 20 years. I will miss
her very much.
