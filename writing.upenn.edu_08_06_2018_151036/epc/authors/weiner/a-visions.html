              gave instructions and said &quot;sir not hip hop to sir cot without 
              sir extra blanket&quot; and &quot;sir not get sir solomon r guggenheimer, 
              if sir eat sir but&quot; and &quot;sir not get sir solomon r guggenheimer 
              if sir not wear sir slip&quot; and &quot;sir not etc, etc&quot; 
              until finally i said &quot;charles i am going to take you out of 
              lead position&quot; and he turned into godzilla a huge image of 
              godzilla before me with the face of charles and he only did that 
              once we have to attribute this to emma his daughter i suppose, whose 
              favorite movie was godzilla i do believe at a certain point and 
              i have a movie of godzilla and i can hear charles's voice saying 
              still &quot;here, here comes the hero&quot; and there was one point 
              if you read the first line of silent teachers where it says &quot;blah&quot; 
              and that was charles's way of blanking out on my forehead any words 
              that were not accurate he would just go &quot;blah, blah, blah, 
              blah&quot; stamped across my forehead and the other thing he did 
              once was i woke up one morning and there he was in his godzilla 
              form, or just the head rather with his white teeth going &quot;grrrrr&quot;

              families go his son felix appeared at 3 mos. as a lizard quite often 
              and taught me yoga i had a slight irregular heartbeat at the time 
              and felix would make me lie down in a cool place in the living room 
              or in the bedroom, wherever, in a relaxation yoga pose and do some 
              very slow breathing, and he would make sure i took my medicine at 
              night and sometimes he would appear as himself as a baby in a sort 
              of basket, it looked like a basket but wasn't of course, but a sort 
              of crib felix first appeared in a swing whose ropes were covered 
              with flowers</font></p>

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">so 
              those are two other animals that i have, godzilla and felix the 
              green monsters, like father like son and i wanted to say in closing 
              because i think i will after this before i get into a whole different 
              category of stories but i could say which has nothing to do with 
              anything on the astral plane or the visual plane that i was vastly 
              amused to find that felix's favorite program was barney who turns 
              out to be a dinosaur now how all this runs in the family i don't 
              know, but i think the important thing is to remember both charles 
              bernstein and felix are silent teachers <br>
