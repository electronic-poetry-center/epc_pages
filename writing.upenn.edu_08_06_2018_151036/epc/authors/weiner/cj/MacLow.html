      <p>Hannah Weiner is the only clairvoyant I know, or that I've ever known, 
        as far as I know. She is also the only person on record--or so she believes 
        as a result of her extensive investigations into both medical &amp; parapsychic 
        literature--to have experienced the particular phenomenon this journal 
        represents, that of being &#147;spoken to&#148; by several persons, most 
        of them seemingly external to herself, by means of printed words in various 
        colors &amp; sizes that appear both on other persons &amp; objects &amp; 
        on her own forehead (in such a way that she can perceive them from within). 
        Hers, however, might have been but a &#147;remarkable case,&#148; were 
        it not for the fact that she is an artist. Her achievement--&amp; it is 
        a considerable one--lies in her having developed a specific literary form 
        through which to convey her remarkable experience.&nbsp;</p>
