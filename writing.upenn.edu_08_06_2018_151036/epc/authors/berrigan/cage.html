<font size=4>

The following interview is pieced together from a series of tape-recorded
interviews with John Cage during his recent visit to New York. They were
made at parties, in flats, and in taxis.<p>

INTERVIEWER: What about Marshall McLuhan?<p>

CAGE: Just this: the media is not a message. I would like to sound a word
of warning to Mr. McLuhan: to speak is to lie. To lie is to
collaborate.<p>

INTERVIEWER: How does that relate?<p>

CAGE: Do you know the Zen story of the mother who had just lost her only
son? She is sitting by the side of the road weeping and the monk comes
along and asks her why she's weeping and she says she has lost her only
son and so he hits her on the head and says, "There, that'll give you
something to cry about."<p>

INTERVIEWER: Yes, somebody should have kicked that monk in the ass!<p>

CAGE: I agree. Somebody said that Brecht wanted everybody to think alike.
I want everybody to think alike. But Brecht wanted to do it through
Communism, in a way. Russia is doing it under government. It's happening
here all by itself without being under a strict government; so if it's
working without trying, why can't it work without being Communist?
Everybody looks and acts alike, and we're getting more and more that way.
I think everybody should be a machine. I think everybody should be
alike.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Isn't that like Pop Art?<p>

CAGE: Yes, that's what Pop Art is, liking things, which incidentally is a
pretty boring idea.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Does the fact that it comes from a machine diminish its value
to you?<p>

CAGE: Certainly not! I think that any artistic product must stand or fall
on what's there. A chimpanzee can do an abstract painting, if it's good,
that's great!<p>

INTERVIEWER: Mary McCarthy has characterized you as a sour Utopian. Is
that accurate?<p>

CAGE: I do definitely mean to be taken literally, yes. All of my work is
directed against those who are bent, through stupidity or design, on
blowing up the planet.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Well, that is very interesting, Mr. Cage, but I wanted to
know what you think in the larger context, i.e., the Utopian.<p>

CAGE: I don't know exactly what you mean there . . . I think the prestige
of poetry is very high in the public esteem right now, perhaps height is
not the right yardstick, but it is perhaps higher than ever. If you can
sell poetry, you can sell anything. No, I think it's a <i>wonderful</i>
time for poetry and I really fell that something is about to boil. And in
answer to your question about whether poetry could resume something like
the Elizabethan spread, I think it's perfectly possible that this could
happen in the next four or five years. All it needs is the right genius to
come along and let fly. And old Masefield, I was pleased to see the other
day celebrating his ninetieth birthday, I think, said that there are still
lots of good tales to tell. I thought that was very nice, and it's true,
too.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Do you think, that is, are you satisfied with the way we are
presently conducting the war in Viet Nam?<p>

CAGE: I am highly dissatisfied with the way we are waging this nasty
war.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Incidentally, your rooms are very beautiful.<p>

CAGE: Nothing incidental about it at all. These are lovely houses; there
are two for sale next door, a bargain, too, but they're just shells.
They've got to be all fixed up inside as this one was, too. They were
just tearing them down when I got the Poetry Society over here to invite
Hy Sobiloff, the only millionaire poet, to come down and read, and he was
taken in hand and shown this house next door, the one that I grew up in,
and what a pitiful state it was in. Pick-axes had already gone through the
roof. And so he bought four of them and fixed this one up for our use as
long as we live, rent free.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Not bad. Tell me, have you ever though of doing sound tracks
for Hollywood movies?<p>

CAGE: Why not? Any composer of genuine ability should work in Hollywood
today. Get the Money! However, few screen composers possess homes in
Bel-Air, illuminated swimming pools, wives in full-length mink coats, three
servants, and that air of tired genius turned sour Utopian. Without that,
today, you are nothing. Alas, money buys pathetically little in Hollywood
beyond the pleasures of living in an unreal world, associating with a
group of narrow people who think, talk, and drink, most of them bad
people; and the doubtful pleasure of watching famous actors and actresses
guzzle up the juice and stuff the old gut in some of the rudest
restaurants in the world. Me, I have never given it a thought.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Tell me about <i>Silence.</i><p>

CAGE: Sure. You never know what publishers are up to. I had the damnedest
time with <i>Silence.</i> My publishers, H***, R***, and W***, at first
were very excited about doing it, and then they handed it over to a young
editor who wanted to rewrite it entirely, and proceeded to do so; he made
a complete hash of it. And I protested about this and the whole thing--the
contract was about to be signed--and they withdrew it, because of this
impasse. The Publisher, who is my friend, said, "Well, John, we never
really took this seriously, did we? So why don't we just forget it?" And I
replied, "Damn it all, I did take it seriously; I want to get published."
Well, then they fired this young man who was rewriting me, and everything
was peaceful. But there was still some static about irregularities of tone
in <i>Silence.</i> So I said, "Well, I'll just tone them down a little,
tune the whole thing up, so to speak." But I did nothing of the sort, of
course! I simply changed the order. I sent it back re-arranged, and then
they wanted me to do something else; finally I just took the whole thing
somewhere else.<p>

INTERVIEWER: What was your father like?<p>

CAGE: I don't want to speak of him. My mother detested him.<p>

INTERVIEWER: What sort of person was your mother?<p>

CAGE: Very religious. Very. But now she is crazy. She lay on top of me
when I was tied to the bed. She writes me all the time begging me to
return. Why do we have to speak of my mother?<p>

INTERVIEWER: Do you move in patterns?<p>

CAGE: Yes. It isn't so much repeating patterns, it's repetition of
similar attitudes that lead to further growth. Everything we do keeps
growing, the skills are there, and are used in different ways each time.
The main thing is to do faithfully those tasks assigned by oneself in
order to further awareness of the body.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Do you believe that all good art is unengaging?<p>

CAGE: Yes I do.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Then what about beauty?<p>

CAGE: Many dirty hands have fondled beauty, made it their banner; I'd like
to chop off those hands, because I do believe in that banner . . . the
difference is that art <i>is</i> beauty, which the Beatniks naturally
lack!<p>

INTERVIEWER: The Beatniks, notably Ed Sanders, are being harassed by the
police lately. Do you approve?<p>

CAGE: On the contrary. The problem is that the police are unloved. The
police in New York are all paranoid . . . they were so hateful for so long
that everybody got to hate them, and that just accumulated and built up.
The only answer to viciousness is kindness. The trouble is that the
younger kids just haven't realized that you've got to make love to the
police in order to solve the police problem.<p> 

INTERVIEWER: But how do you force love on the police?<p>

CAGE: Make love to the police. We need highly trained squads of lovemakers
to go everywhere and make love.<p>

INTERVIEWER: But there are so many police, it is a practical problem.<p>

CAGE: Yes, I know, it will certainly take time, but what a lovely
project.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Do you think it is better to be brutal than to be
indifferent?<p>

CAGE: Yes. It is better to be brutal than indifferent. Some artists prefer
the stream of consciousness. Not me. I'd rather beat people up.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Say something about Happenings. You are credited with being
the spiritual daddy of the Happening.<p>

CAGE: Happenings are boring. When I hear the word "Happening" I spew
wildly into my lunch!<p>

INTERVIEWER: But Allan Kaprow calls you "the only living Happening."<p>

CAGE: Allan Kaprow can go eat a Hershey-bar!<p>

INTERVIEWER: Hmmm. Well put. Now, to take a different tack, let me ask
you: what about sex?<p>

CAGE: Sex is a biologic weapon, insofar as I can see it. I feel that sex,
like every other human manifestation, has been degraded for anti-human
purposes. I had a dream recently in which I returned to the family home
and found a different father and mother in the bed, though they were still
somehow <i>my</i> father and mother. What I would like, in the way of
theatre, is that somehow a method would be devised, a new form, that would
allow each member of the audience at a play to watch his own parents,
young again, make love. Fuck, that is, not court.<p>

INTERVIEWER: That certainly would be different, wouldn't it? What other
theatrical vent interests you?<p>

CAGE: Death. The Time Birth Death gimmick. I went recently to see "Dr. No"
at Forty-Second Street. It's a fantastic movie, so cool. I walked outside
and somebody threw a cherry bomb right in front of me, in this big crowd.
And there was blood, I saw blood on people and all over. I felt like I was
bleeding all over. I saw in the paper that week that more and more people
are throwing them. Artists, too. It's just part of the scene--hurting
people.<p>

INTERVIEWER: How does Love come into all this?<p>

CAGE: It doesn't. It comes later. Love is memory. In the immediate present
we don't love; life is too much with us. We lust, wilt, snort, swallow,
gobble, hustle, nuzzle, etc. Later, memory flashes images swathed in
nostalgia and yearning. We call that Love. Ha! Better to call it
Madness.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Is everything erotic to you?<p>

CAGE: Not lately. No, I'm just kidding. Of course everything is erotic to
me; if it isn't erotic, it isn't interesting.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Is life serious?<p>

CAGE: Perhaps. How should I know? In any case, one must not be serious.
Not only is it absurd, but a serious person cannot have sex.<p>

INTERVIEWER: Very interesting! But, why not?<p>

CAGE: If you have to ask, you'll never know.<p>
