Here comes the man! He's talking a lot<br>
I'm sitting, by myself. I've got<br>
A ticket to ride. Outside is, "Out to lunch."<br>
It's no great pleasure, being on the make.<br>
Well, who is? Or, well everyone is, tho.<br>
"I'm laying there, & some guy comes up<br>
& hits me with a billyclub!" A fat guy<br>
Says. Shut up. & like that we cross a river<br>
Into the Afterlife. Everything goes on as before<br>
But never does any single experience make total use<br>
Of you. You are always slightly ahead,<br>
Slightly behind. It merely baffles, it doesn't hurt.<br>
It's total pain & it breaks your heart<br> 
In a less than interesting way. Every day<br>
Is payday. Never enough pay. A deja-vu<br>
That lasts. It's no big thing, anyway.<br>
A lukewarm greasy hamburger, ice-cold pepsi<br>
        that hurts your teeth.<p>
