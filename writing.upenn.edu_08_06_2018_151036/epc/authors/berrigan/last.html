Before I began life this time <br>
I took a crash course in Counter-Intelligence <br>
Once here I signed in, see name below, and added<br> 
Some words remembered from an earlier time, <br>
"The intention of the organism is to survive." <br>
My earliest, & happiest, memories pre-date WWII,<br> 
They involve a glass slipper & a helpless blue rose <br>
In a slender blue single-rose vase: Mine <br>
Was a story without a plot. The days of my years<br> 
Folded into one another, an easy fit, in which <br>
I made money & spent it, learned to dance & forgot, gave<br> 
Blood, regained my poise, & verbalized myself a place <br>
In Society. 101 St. Mark's Place, apt. 12A, NYC 10009 <br>
New York. Friends appeared & disappeared, or wigged out, <br>
Or stayed; inspiring strangers sadly died; everyone <br>
I ever knew aged tremendously, except me. I remained <br>
Somewhere between 2 and 9 years old. But frequent <br>
Reification of my own experiences delivered to me <br>
Several new vocabularies, I loved that almost most of all.<br> 
I once had the honor of meeting Beckett & I dug him. <br>
The pills kept me going, until now. Love, & work, <br>
Were my great happinesses, that other people die the source <br> 
Of my great, terrible, & inarticulate one grief. In my time <br>
I grew tall & huge of frame, obviously possessed <br>
Of a disconnected head, I had a perfect heart. The end <br>
Came quickly & completely without pain, one quiet night as I <br>
Was sitting, writing, next to you in bed, words chosen randomly <br>
From a tired brain, it, like them, suitable, & fitting. <br>
Let none regret my end who called me friend.<p>
