Here I am at 8:08 p.m. indefinable ample rhythmic frame<br>
The air is biting, February, fierce arabesques <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the way to
tree in winter streetscape<br>
I drink some American poison liquid air which bubbles<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and smoke to have
character and to lean<br>
In. The streets look for Allen, Frank, or me, Allen<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a movie, Frank
disappearing in the air, it's<br>
Heavy with that lightness, heavy on me, I heave <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through it, them, as<br>
The Calvados is being sipped on Long island now<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty years almost ago,
and the man smoking<br>
Is looking at the smilingly attentive woman, & telling.<br>
Who would have thought that I'd be here, nothing <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrapped up, nothing
buried, everything<br>
Love, children, hundreds of them, money, marriage-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ethics, a politics of
grace,<br>
Up in the air, swirling, burning even or still, now<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than ever before?<br>
Not that practically a boy, serious in corduroy car coat<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes penetrating the
winter twilight at 6th<br>
& Bowery in 1961. Not that pretty girl, nineteen, who was<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going to have to go,
careening into middle-age so,<br>
To burn, & to burn more fiercely than even she could imagine<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so to go. Not that painter
who from very first meeting<br>
I would never & never will leave alone until we both vanish<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the thin air we
signed up for & so demanded<br>
To breathe & who will never leave me, not for sex, nor politics<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor even for stupid
permanent estrangement which is<br>
Only our human lot & means nothing. No, not him.<br>
There's a song, "California Dreaming", but no, I won't do that<br>
I am 43. When will I die? I will never die, I will live<br>
To be 110, & I will never go away, & you will never escape from me<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who am always & only a
ghost, despite this frame, Spirit<br>
Who lives only to nag.<br>
I'm only pronouns, & I am all of them, & I didn't ask for this<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You did<br>
I came into your life to change it & it did so & now nothing <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will ever change<br>
That, and that's that.<br>
Alone & crowded, unhappy fate, nevertheless <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slip softly into the
air<br>
The world's furious song flows through my costume.<p>
