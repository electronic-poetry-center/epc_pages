      <p>       
      <font size=4> This class, you understand I don't know anything about this class. I do
know one or two of you from the past, or from dubious reputation, or
things like that, but generally I don't know anything about you. I've
taught a lot in my life; I've taught the last eight years at various
universities, Michigan and Iowa and Yale and Essex in England and so on
and I do know a lot about being in classroom situations, but generally
what is given to a teacher when he's in a class, is he knows all the
class. He knows why they're there. That is, they're getting a university
degree, or on occasion they're all would-be poets, and you're teaching a
workshop class or something like that. But this kind of class is very
interesting to me, actually because I don't really understand it at all, I
don't understand fully what unity there is to the class, actually. I don't
exactly understand what single concept binds you all together and has you
here as a class. It doesn't matter too much, but it matters in the sense
that, the question between the teacher and the class is . . . you're there
sitting out there and I'm sitting here, and I'm supposed to do something
and you're supposed to do something. And I'm supposed to do what I'm
supposed to do and what you're supposed to do. Understand? And I'm
supposed to give you some clues as to what you're supposed to do, and
chastise you generally if you don't do it, and also do whatever I'm
supposed to do. Or else be like most teachers and just sort of fake the
whole thing. I'm the visiting poet. It's a great title; I love it
actually. It's what I usually am when I teach at universities. I asked
Anne [Waldman] today, I said why, when I looked at the schedule it said
for the class that I had to do, it said 1-3:30 visiting poets. Great. Here
I am. I mean, you have from 1 to 3:30, 1 mean you know, go ahead. I mean I
asked her why she didn't assign me a subject matter. I realize she didn't
assign me a subject matter because I wouldn't have paid any attention to
it in any case. Or I would have paid some attention to it but I don't even
really know what you've been doing so far, how many of you go to Anne's
classes consistently, or whatever. So I guess I'm just going to make
certain assumptions. That is, I'm going to assume that you all do
everything. And it doesn't really matter whether you do it or not. But you
see I'm interested in this particular situation. I mean this is a . .
. This is the poetry part of the Naropa Institute. And I am a poet.
There's no
question about that, because I have these books, you see, with my name on
them. And so I am a poet. You'll find, that's not so funny, actually;
you'll find that it'd be very difficult for a long time after you start
writing poetry and get interested in it, to have any way to verify the
fact that you're a poet. When you go to get a passport and you write down
your occupation, you'd be surprised how few people ever write "poet." When
you're sitting on the airplane next to a man with a briefcase, and you're
going to give a reading, and he's going to a business conference, and he
says to you, hello my name is Herman Bluewinkle, and you say, my name is
Ted Berrigan, and he says, I'm in electronics, what do you do? And you
say, I'm a poet, and he says, holy shit, man. And his eyes get completely
glazed over, and he's sure that you're going to whip out all of your poems
immediately and read them all to him. Which is the last thing that you
want to do. You don't really want to read your poems to anyone, unless a,
they want to pay you for doing it, or b, they ask you to do it, or c,
you're stoned out of your brain, and you just feel like doing something
like that. But at this age - I'll be forty-two this year - there's no
question in my mind that I'm a poet, and that's really all that I am. I've
been a schoolteacher, a university professor; I've done a number of other
things, too, but essentially I'm a poet; that's my profession. In that
sense, I'm a professional poet; it's my career. Lots of people don't like
that idea, that one could be a career poet. I mean, lots of people don't
like lots of ideas, you know; that's not really so important. Lots of
people don't like the idea of using professionalism with, in conjunction
with the idea of being a poet. But . . . it's like the story about John
Wayne showing up on the set of one of John Ford's movies one morning when
they were about to shoot, about seven o'clock in the morning, and John
Ford said to John Wayne, as they were about to shoot, he said, Are you
ready, Duke; do you know your lines, and John Wayne said, I'm always
ready; I'm a professional. And I thought that was terrific, actually. I
mean, he didn't mean it like if he said, I'm going to shoot you in the
head right now, that John Ford couldn't say move your left arm while
you're doing that. He only meant, I know my lines. This is my business.
Poetry is my business. I don't know how many of you are interested in
making poetry be your business, in the course of your life. It's my
conception that it would be a good thing if everybody wrote poetry, in the
world, because it seems to me that it's a natural human activity. Just
like singing is for the birds. Birds don't sing because they think they're
Neil Young, you know; I mean, they sing because that's what birds do.
Writing poetry is one of the things that human beings do, and can do.
Writing poetry is how you tell your parents, your lover, all the people
who don't know you and yourself, who you are, how you feel. The
connections are not always made directly. This is, you can write a poem
called "To My Mother," and the chances are ninety-nine out of a hundred
that your mother will find the poem out to lunch, and I mean . . . You
know,
that wasn't the point. But it's very important to write it anyway. If you
don't do that, if you don't write poetry, if you don't express yourself,
that is who you are, in one or more of the many art forms that exist in
the human sphere: you're a partly crippled individual. You find yourself
slightly gathered up at the shoulder or at the knee, or something like
that; you're slightly tight somewhere. Nevertheless, none of that means
that you have to be a . . . or make poetry your business.
<p> In the long ago past, poetry was a court activity, and everybody at the
  court is . . . The ladies-in-waiting and the hand-maidens and the
  courtiers
  and the friends of the duke and the king and so on, they all wrote poetry.
  In China and in Japan and in the European countries, it was expected of
  you that you do that. It was somewhat of a surprise when someone like
  Shakespeare, say, wrote poetry. But it wasn't too much of a surprise,
  because being an attractive youth and being attracted to members of the
  court, he aspired to that kind of social circle. From whatever fringes
  that he could be in it. And so one of the things, one of the ways that he
  could, besides his natural physical beauty and so on, one of the ways that
  he could be part of that kind of circle, was to take part in their social
  activities, and it so happened that poetry was something that he could do
  very well. Shakespeare was not a . . . Poetry was not his business. The
  theater was his business. But you see a . . . There were people at the
  court, there were people that knew about the court, had reasonable access
  to it; that is, they were close enough proximitywise, so that they were
  aware of such things, and then there were the peasants who had hoed the
  field all day. Now they didn't write any poetry. You don't write any
  poetry if you hoe the field all day. 'Cause at night you're tired. And
  besides the people in the court come and take away two-thirds of what you
  hoe, so that they can write poetry some of the time.
  That's one of the reasons that poetry is a business; it's a full-time
  business; it doesn't take up all your time the way working in the a&p may
  take up all your time, because you don't have to be on the job in that
  respect all the time; you don't have to go there and be there for so many
  hours a day and come out. But being a poet is a twenty-four-hour-a-day
  thing. You're always on. I could be talking about being a painter or being
  a musician or being whatever, but you're always on. What Allen refers to
  as mindfulness is simply that. It's a matter of being awake, alive, alert,
  aware of possibilities. If you're a poet, all of that is partly channeled
  into the fact that maybe you're going to write some of them down, too.
<p> Jack Kerouac tells a really marvelous story of his novel he wrote called <i>Tristessa,</i> in which he was in Mexico, and he was involved with this
  Mexican girl who was a prostitute named, in the book, Tristessa, and this
  junkie. And Tristessa was a junkie herself, and Jack was a wandering
  novelist who had taken a notion to go to Mexico. And the book is quite
  terrific, actually, because Jack has a marvelous voice, and if you can
  hear that voice, he's a natural-born storyteller. And it's a delight to
  hear a story, especially told by a terrific storyteller. In the book there
  is not a particular resolution between the character that is Jack Kerouac
  and the girl that is Tristessa. Obviously he's drawn to her; there is a
  romantic sort of number there, and she has some sort of feeling toward
  him, but she's totally caught up in her life of making a subsistence and
  involved in the hazards and difficulties and harassments and hassles of
  being a part-time junkie. The junkie in the book is sort of a terrific old
  man, the person that Jack is most interested in; he is totally involved in
  his life, which is just sort of getting enough junk everyday so that he
  can look at his big toe half the day and think about the Mayan codices for
  a while, and things like that, and Jack doesn't really have anything to
  do, except write this book, which he does, actually. But the story that
  I'm referring to is the story that Jack told me, which was recounted in a
  Paris Review interview with him. Eventually he did get to go to bed with
  Tristessa, and what happened was that she got a little sick, actually. She
  had the Mexican flu, and a couple of other things like that, and was a
  little junk weak, and so on, and she was in bed one night, and Jack
  suddenly realized that he could stop, that he had written his book and
  that now he was leaving soon, now he could crawl into bed with her. And so
  he went and he crawled into bed with her, and she said, Oh Jack, I seek
  [sick], I very seek, weak, frail, and he said, I know all that; I'm
  writing this book about you being all that. And so you're caught up in
  that consciousness if you're a writer that you are; you might write it
  down, you know, but that's not an unpleasant consciousness, actually; so
  what if you might write it down; I mean you might not write it down either
  - you might get hit by a car, too. The thing that I'm stressing is that
  poetry and being a full-time poet is a full-time thing. And you can hardly
  do anything else and be an artist, a poet. Probably some of you in the
  audience . . . and maybe some of you could cite examples of people who
  have
  done other . . . William Carlos Williams was a doctor, and Wallace
  Stevens was an insurance man; there have been others. They were the
  exceptions, not the rule. The rule is generally, if you have to spend . .
  .
<p> Q: Mao.
<p> TB: Chairman Mao, yeah, he's an interesting possibility; Ho Chi Minh would
  be more interesting, because Ho Chi Minh is a pretty good poet. But most
  of his poems were written while he was in jail. Now if you go to jail, you
  can probably be a full-time poet and be a prisoner at the same time. These
  are probably two things you can do. Chairman Mao is not a very good poet.
  He's a lousy poet. Of the poems I've read of his, naturally not knowing
  any Chinese, and therefore being a great authority, one was very good. It
  seems to me that anybody that writes a few hundred poems ought to be able
  to write a very good one. Probably should be able to write twenty very
  good ones. Because the first, if you start writing, the first couple of
  years you write quite a number of pretty good poems; it's just after that
  it gets a little hard. And then one wants to see what you do in the next
  three or four years, and if you're still around after that six or seven
  years, you're probably going to be around. You're probably going to be a
  poet. And everybody is rooting for you to do that, but if you don't, it's
  all right. What the hell. We get ours, you get yours. I mean, it's not
  quite that brutal, but in a way, it has to be. It's a full-time thing, and
  particularly the business of becoming a poet.
<p> Now what is a poet? A poet is someone who writes poems. They don't have to
  be good poems. There are many ways to write poems, but it would probably
  be more preferable to say a poet is someone who makes poems. What is a
  poem? A poem is anything that anybody wants to call a poem. Basically
  because we don't want to bother with that kind of question. It's a stupid,
  ridiculous question, and one does not want to get into those kinds of
  definitions. If you think you'll be a poet, you'll know what a poem is.
  Because you'll recognize it when you see them. And some poems, you see
  them, and they're good, and that's great. And some poems, you see them,
  and they're not so good, but both those are poems. Some things are called
  poems, and you see them, and they're not poems, but they're good to read.
  If a person wants to call them a poem, that's fine. Some things that you
  see are writings; you look at them, and they're called poems, and they're
  not good to read, and they're not poems, and so you just forget, you just
  ignore them, because everything that's no good will disappear of its own
  accord in time. You don't have to really worry about that. It's like bad
  poets, you don't have to worry about who's a bad poet; you know you don't
  have to go around thinking, god there are fifty bad poets in the world - I
  hate Robert Lowell, Bill Merwin, Allen Ginsberg, and Ted Berrigan and all
  those poets; why doesn't everybody just love Gary Snyder. Given the
  passage of a few years and a few more years and a few years, everything
  finds - in the cultural world in the arts - generally everything finds its
  own level. And we're left with it. It might take a hundred . . . For a
  hundred years everybody might think that Shakespeare was reasonably good
  and Ben Jonson was totally great, but actually in that hundred years, most
  people probably didn't really think that, but some scholars wrote down
  that that was true. But in any case, by now everybody knows that Ben
  Jonson was pretty damn good; he was even more than that, and Shakespeare
  was wonderful. Everybody knows that so much that everybody thinks that
  they've read Shakespeare. Which is very funny, actually, because most
  people haven't read Shakespeare hardly at all. You do have to read
  Shakespeare. It's imperative that you do read Shakespeare, and everybody
  else that you're supposed to have read. However, you don't have to do it
  by tomorrow. I mean, take your time; it's all right. But don't mouth off
  about something you think you know, that Shakespeare's included in, around
  somebody that's read Shakespeare. Because they'll just give you, if they
  have any wit . . . They'll just give you a look that says, huh, what's
  this
  guy saying - I mean he's saying something about poems and sonnets and this
  and that, and he hasn't even read Shakespeare, obviously. All right. I'm
  still emphasizing the business about it being a full-time thing, and it's
  particularly a full-time thing when you're young. Now, it's impossible to
  be both a student and a poet. What you generally are is a student-poet.
  Now, there's nothing wrong with that at all, but on the one hand you
  shouldn't let it crush you in any way that you are that. That's fine. On
  the other hand, you shouldn't be too overambitious; that is, when you get
  your fifteenth poem done, you shouldn't necessarily run up and shove them
  under Allen Ginsberg's or Bill Merwin's or my nose and say, here's my
  poems, man - take me to Bobbs-Merrill, Random House, immediately, you
  know. Don't worry; if you're good, and you write good poems, you'll get
  published, and everybody, and you'll get famous like people do in the
  poetry world, and everybody will know about you, and you'll be a poet, and
  that will be fine. And you'll still be fat, old, toothless, boring, and
  not have any money, and all that, but you'll get to come to Boulder,
  Colorado, and sit up here and act like you're doing something. And that's
  not so funny, because you are doing something, actually. One of the things
  that you are doing is that you are a carrier of the culture, sort of like
  Typhoid Mary, but in a good way. There are wonderful, glorious,
  gorgeous, beautiful, and marvelous things about America, for example, and
  the English-speaking world that are only carried on through our existence
  by us and in the future will only exist in us the way China and Japan in
  the fifteenth and sixteenth century now only exist in artifacts, works of
  art and works of poetry. Generally even music dies away. One doesn't
  really know much about how the music of ancient Greece, for example, say,
  might have sounded. But the words are still . . . The words stay. Which is
  very nice; I mean words do stay. That's one of the reasons why Ed Marshall
  was saying that the word is dangerous. Leave the word alone; it is
  dangerous. That is, don't tell your own story if it's going to give you a
  nervous breakdown to hear it. And believe me it's going to come close, if
  you tell the truth. Because human beings are a rotten lot, I mean,
  generally speaking. However, they're very amusing, and like that's the
  redeeming quality. The point that I'm trying to pull out of that is that
  as a beginning, at the time when you're a student, you're a student, and
  that is what you are, and that's good. It's very good to be a student;
  it's good to be a student as long as possible, as long as you can stand
  it. One of the reasons why it's good is that it's better than most
  things. At some point you stop being a student. I'm using the word
  "student" very specifically, that is as an enrolled member of some
  institution. Not some insane asylum necessarily, but some university of
  something like that. When you stop being a student, you're generally faced
  with the problem of how you support yourself in the world. Many people
  face that problem while they're students, too, but they're not really
  faced with it; if they were really faced with it, they wouldn't be able to
  be students. When you're a student you can always pull some hustle and
  keep on being a student. But when you stop being a student, then you are
  faced with how you are going to support yourself in the world. And if
  you're a poet, as well. When I say "if you are," I mean if you aspire to
  that with every fiber in you, if that's what you want in such a way that
  you know that's what you want, that that's what you're going after, and
  that's what you're going to try to do, and that's what you're going to be.
  You have these two situations. One is that you have to exist in terms of
  physical needs, a place to live, things to eat, and all the vast
  possibility of necessary luxuries, like radios, records, TVs, cars, things
  like that, shoes, things like that. That's one. The other one is the fact
  that in order to be a poet you have to spend your full time on it. Now,
  what you do with that full time is another story, which we can possibly
  discuss a little bit later, but the fact that you have to make a living
  and the fact that you're going to be a poet are contradictory; they're . .
  .
  The tensions of the two work against each other, and it's very difficult
  to do both, in an orthodox way. You can't get a job and work five days a
  week and be a poet on weekends. Because if you do that you'll be an
  amateur. There's nothing wrong with being an amateur, but I'm assuming
  that you aspire to be something more than an amateur. You'll be an
  amateur. It's also bad karma to work at a job fulltime and not go at it
  as seriously as you were going to go at being a poet. Wallace Stevens,
  incidentally, was not just an insurance man; he was vice-president of the
  Hartford Casualty Company. I mean there's no sense fooling around; if
  you're going to do something, you might as well be good at it. You can
  also be bad at it which is a pleasure, too, but if you're going to be good
  at it . . . I mean, I mean if you're going to be able to do it, you have
  to
  be able to do it well. What you do about the problem of staying alive,
  making a living, while you're going about being a poet, frankly I can't
  really tell you. Everybody has to find their own solution. It's easier for
  men, or has been in the past, than for women. Basically because men
  usually get women to support them. Also to have their babies and do other
  things and somehow pay the rent. Maybe these days it's less difficult for
  women; I don't really know; I don't care either - I mean, it's my own
  problem that interests me in that area more than anybody else's. But I do
  know that it's very difficult to get married to someone and have a couple
  of children - I'm speaking now, if you're a woman - and that's almost the
  same thing as getting a job in the A&P and be a full-time poet. If you do
  such a thing, and it's a very natural and good human thing to do, you
  still have to insist with all that natural rage that every human being is
  born with, and has all their life, that you are, and are going to be, a
  poet. And that you are going to make the time to do what you - have to do,
  and that you're going to do it all the time, and that if anybody doesn't
  like it, I mean you know, too bad; I mean you're just going to do that.
  Now some of you - you being you and everybody else - some of you probably
  have talents, and you can go out and do journalism and do various other
  little jobs for ten or fifteen years like say John Ashbery did, and
  meanwhile become some sort of major poet. Or you can do what Allen
  Ginsberg did; you can be a sort of shocking figure in the universe; by
  virtue of that plus a few nervous breakdowns, and Time magazine, you can
  become famous and modestly rich; say you could have $6,000 a year, or
  something like that. Everybody thinks that Allen has millions of dollars,
  you know. In fact Allen makes it a point not to have millions of dollars
  because if he had it we would all go around and ask for some of it. And he
  would like to give it to us, because that's how he feels about things kind
  of. Again, that's no joke. In times of need of my own, I've often turned
  to Allen, actually, and when he's had it, he's never denied me, and yet
  for both of us the situation was a pain in the ass. I mean I didn't want
  to have to ask, and he didn't really want to have to be bothered, because
  we didn't really want our association to be on that level, you know.
<p> All right. Will somebody please tell me what I said so far? What do you do
  as full-time poets, twenty-four hours a day? O.K. I don't know what you do
  each day; I couldn't make you out a daily schedule, but what you do is you
  read every poet that you can possibly find to read and write as many poems
  as you can possibly bring yourself to write for as many years as you can
  possibly do that. And if you stick that out for a sufficient number of
  years, you will be moderately well-educated about poetry. That will infect
  your own writing; your own writing will show your mindfulness of the
  potentialities, the possibilities in poetry and the writing of poetry, and
  you will become a better and better poet. It may be given to some of you
  to become a great important major poet, and it may only be given to others
  of you to be just a good poet. It never occurred to me to think of
  getting, I mean . . . It's not that I was modest, it was that I hadn't
  gotten to the stage yet when I realized that there were such things as
  major and minor, or good and better. I just thought that it was amazing
  that one might get to be a poet. I didn't even know till I was about
  twenty years old that there were such things alive; I thought there were
  only these dead people that had been poets. But the poet is anybody that
  can get to be a poet, because it is within a natural human sphere and
  scope. And it does require that effort; that is you have to write many
  many poems, and you have to read many many poems, and you have to
  cultivate those two habits, so that you will write many times when you
  don't particularly feel like it and so that you will read, consistently.
  So that like when you would think that you haven't been writing for six
  months and then suddenly you feel like writing again, you look in a drawer
  and you notice that you've got about four hundred fragments of little
  things that you dashed off here and there and threw in the drawer, because
  you didn't want to took at things; you didn't think you liked poetry
  anymore. I mean you have to be very serious about it. Being very serious
  means, again, mindfulness; it means being alert to the humor of
  everything. It's ridiculous to be a poet. It's one of the silliest
  imaginable things you can be; it's also one of the most important things
  in the universe, that somebody be. But somebody will be that, because it
  is that, so you don't have to. I mean if you decide next week that you
  don't like poetry anymore, and you'd rather be a conceptual artist and
  make anthills in Colorado, that's all right too. Because somebody else
  will be, you know it's all right. But once I read . . . I remember reading
  once in a copy of <i>Kulchur Magazine</i> a critical article by a fellow
  named
  Gil
  Sorrentino, who is in this <i>New American Poetry</i> anthology. I don't
  like
  Gil's poetry very much, but I've always liked Gil because he's so
  incredible deadly serious. He's a Thomist - how many know what a Thomist
  is? Well, he's a neo-Thomist actually, but he's a Thomist; that is, he - I
  don't know how I could explain this - but he believes in the power of the
  mind to exert itself in some sort of mathematical fashion so that
  everything in the world generally can be explained in terms of thesis,
  antithesis, and synthesis. The synthesis becomes a new thesis which you
  can have an antithesis to, and so on. And everything is completely
  explanatory. Except that he doesn't really believe that that means that a
  god exists. He has never made himself completely clear on that point. But
  he does think that it means that if you're a poet, you have to sometime in
  your life read Robert Browning. Now, somebody should laugh at that - thank
  you, Larry - because I remember when I read this essay . . . I mean Gil
  didn't say all those things I said; he just said something like, if a poet
  hasn't read his Browning, sooner or later it'll show up in his work. Now I
  thought that was very humorous, because in the first place I hadn't read
  too much Browning because I didn't feel like reading him because he was
  too muscular and I didn't . . . I always wanted him to take it a little
  easier when I was reading him, because I like to read; I find reading very
  intense, and I don't like to be disturbed by guys that are always shouting
  when they're writing, like Browning is. But eventually actually I read
  quite a bit of Browning, because I had to teach him. One way to get out of
  your head sometimes is to become a teacher. Last year I read <i>The
    Scarlet
    Letter,</i> actually, which is one of my great achievements in life, and
  it
  was a great book, just like they had been saying all this time. I thought
  that was really terrific, you know. I don't know what good it did me, but
  it was a great book. I remember I read <i>Ulysses</i> three times, and I
  never
  had a fucking clue, as to . . . I mean, there were parts of it I liked a
  lot; other parts I really just went through it and, puzzlement, you know,
  and the thing that baffled me was how come that I didn't get to the end of
  the book and read the last page, that the lightning didn't flash in the
  sky and I didn't turn into Batman or something like that. Because that was
  the implication, that was given by Ezra Pound and everybody else; you
  know, that if you just read <i>Ulysses,</i> you would become Batman
  tomorrow, you
  know. Alas, that will not happen. A few years ago, the illusion was, in
  the world, was that if you read the works of John Ashbery you would become
  Captain Marvel instantly. Alas that was true. If you read the works of
  John Ashbery, you would become Captain Marvel immediately. Unfortunately
  you would become a junior Captain Marvel of which the giant Captain Marvel
  was John Ashbery, and furthermore when any other poet read your works, the
  first thing that they would think is that you've been reading John
  Ashbery. And they're right, because when you imitate John Ashbery, it's
  very visible. John has a way of using words like "in order to," sort of
  throw-away phrases, in this remarkably distinct way, which make all these
  sort of very, fairly ordinary human things that he's saying sound
  brilliant, wonderful, and like they're technical masterpieces. The fact is
  they are technical masterpieces. But if you do that, your poems will look
  like just lists, these lists of "in order to," and "only here and there,"
  and "a kind of," and also they will be very unamusing. He's a poor
  specimen, actually, but he's very amusing. I say that in all honesty; I
  mean Allen Ginsberg is a noble human being, despite the fact that he's a
  mean old mother type, I don't know, but John Ashbery is a poor specimen,
  actually. He's one of the nicest persons you could ever meet, given
  certain conditions, but generally speaking, actually he's a poor specimen.
  I mean that somebody is a great poet doesn't mean that they're the
  greatest person that ever lived, and that when you come up and show them
  your feeble horrifying writings that they're going to tell you that you're
  great, you know. Actually, they're just going to look at them and be
  appalled. Even if . . . And the fact is that even if your works are good,
  they're not going to like them. Because they're twenty years older than
  you are, and they just don't understand what works that are good are like
  by people twenty years younger than they are. I remember Kenneth Koch once
  telling me, he said imagine what it would be like if you were the only
  Surrealist at the University of Minnesota. I think that was a profound
  remark, actually, and it has very much to do with being a poet. Being a
  poet is very much like the . . . has a lot to do with the way that little
  children make things. Children can make a game out of anything. And if you
  leave any special things lying around on the floor the children will get
  them, and they'll put them, the milk bottle into the shoe, and paper bag,
  crammed into the milk bottle, and they'll bring it over and say, look what
  I made, And you say, that's really terrific, that's really great; what is
  it? And then they say, I don't know; what is it? Unfortunately, most of
  you are not little children, And if you . . . actually if you put the
  milk
  bottle in the shoe, and the paper bag in the milk bottle, you'd be
  geniuses, but that isn't what you'll do, what you'll do is say, write down
  about thirty boring lines about your relationship with your mother, or
  something, and then you'll bring it over and you'll say, look what I've
  made. And generally most people will say, Yah, uh yuk, I can't believe it,
  goddamn are you out of your mind? Why don't you go out and read Dante or
  something? Consequently, what you need to do - because it is 
  very important when you make something to be able to show it to someone
  and
  have them say it is terrific . . . So that you will, I mean it's necessary
  to get affection, love, a certain kind of understanding; it's also
  necessary to get encouragement, and it's further . . . It's necessary to
  be
  able to make a show. Like for example a peacock does what it goes like
  this; I mean they just go up and say, look what I made. That's actually
  part of the important part, too. The peacock doesn't care, you know, the
  peacock comes up and goes like this, and you say, boring, man, send me a
  guinea hen. The peacock doesn't understand that, that you said that,
  so it doesn't really care, but I mean people do understand, you know, so
  what you ought to do is, if you're a serious poet, is to have three or
  four friends that are equally serious, either poets or other kinds of
  artists, that you can not necessarily compare notes from - with - and
  especially not necessarily show your works to and have them say this is
  really good, but if you just changed this word in the third line, it would
  be better. Even that's not what you want. What you want is that you're
  doing something and you're doing it all together and they exist in the
  world and they serve as character models for you and you for them. And
  you're all proud of each other and pleased with each other, and
  unfortunately you also all fuck each other's wives, boyfriends, and
  girlfriends, and everything gets awful, and you have nervous breakdowns
  and go to the sanatorium, but that's just life. I mean, that'll happen
  anyway, even if you move to the suburbs and become an insurance man, so
  don't worry about that. In the end it will all settle itself out; you'll
  all be married to each other's wives, and you'll all have super
  understandings with each other because you'll all have been intermarried
  and everything like that; it'll be great. You can't really do it in
  isolation, is what I'm saying. A next tenet to go with that is I think the
  greatest thing I was ever told by another artist; I was told this when I
  was in my twenties, after a specific sort of bad experience, was I was
  told that it's very important to pick your audience to whom you show your
  works. If you show your works to jerks, you will get a jerk's response.
  This may hurt you. It's all right to be hurt, but not if it interferes
  with the serious business of your being a poet. This jerk 
  that you show your work to may be your best friend, on many levels. But do
  not show this jerk your works, because they're a jerk about showing works
  to, you see. You show people your works so that they will be impressed.
  Show them to people that will be impressed. If you want to show them to
  other people like John Ashbery or me or Anne or to Larry [Fagin] or
  somebody like that, start a magazine, or publish little books, and send a
  copy to everyone in the world that you want to read them. You'll be
  surprised how many will read them. They won't necessarily write back, and
  respond, but they will read them. And if you're good, they'll remember.
  And at some point in time, they will respond. And you'll meet them, and
  you'll be introduced to them, and someone will say, John Ashbery, this is
  Steve so-and-so, and he'll say, oh yes. I've seen your poems in magazines.
  I enjoyed them quite a lot, and then you'll be knocked out for the next
  five years, and, you know, you can write incredible masterpieces, you
  know.
