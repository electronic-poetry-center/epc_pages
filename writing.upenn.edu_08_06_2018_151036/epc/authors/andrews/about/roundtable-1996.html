<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>. . . Taylor mentioned that he noticed
from the interview that there's a shift in Andrews's poetics from what he's said
on previous occasions, and since Bruce is famous for aesthetic consistency over
the length of his career, perhaps it would be interesting to address that.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>What is the shift?</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I wouldn't see it so much as a shift in
program or project as a backing-off from some of the more grandiose claims that
are made in the talk he gave in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Politics
of Poetic Form </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>anthology. I've got
two things highlighted here, one in the body of the talk he gave proper:</p>

<p class=excerpt style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=excerpt style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To 'horizon' -- as a verb, an
infinitive -- that is, to grasp what the animating pressures (or constructions
&amp; arrangements) of intention &amp; desire are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>given,</i> are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>up against,</i>
are faced with. (This is the hidden 'face' of desire.) The scope of this
embraces the overall social body, the contested hegemonies on the map, the
whole that needs altering, a total which is close to the 'false': not 'everything,'
not statistics, not the 'thousand points of light,' but a system.</p>

<p class=excerpt style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'><span
style='mso-tab-count:2'>                        </span>In its own workings,
writing can offer a more intimate grasp of this totality: expanding to the limit
the contextual horizon within which you can imagine meaning &amp; sense being
produced and realized. (29)</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He seems to be making a claim here
for the ability of writing, and particularly the kind of poetic writing in
which he's engaged, to engage in a mapping of a social totality. In a sense
that rehearses the claim of a theorist like Althusser explaining why Marxism is
not just another ideology; there are these particularistic ideologies that all
contain some significant blindspots or are based on their position in the
sphere of [general] ideology, but Marxism manages to escape that by virtue of
being a science. It's a pretty bold claim for Althusser to make, and it seems
like a really outrageous claim for Andrews to make when you shift the ground
from critical theory to the practice of a certain kind of poetic writing. He
seems to be making the same sort of totalizing claim for a mid-'80s &quot;language
writing&quot; that Althusser would have made for his own structural Marxism. In
the interview, he seems to back off from that. Charles asks, &quot;Do you think
poetry is a place that can change political values? is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>medium</i> that can change political values?&quot; And Bruce says, &quot;There's
a lot of posturing that goes on around that issue. People making theoreticist
claims about writing that nobody reads, as having tremendous revolutionary
implications, and then other people scoffing at the very possibility or even
the desire to have poetry or writing have any kind of social and political
implications. I think it works on the writer, and it works on the reader,
probably more as a kind of reinforcement of more fragile beliefs or attitudes
that were getting formed, that need more support.&quot; So . . .</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But I don't see those two pieces as
addressing the same point.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>I think they are. That's what struck me
about this interview, that he seems to have changed from a rather severe
Marxism in this thinking to something more like an anarchist position, where
the direct change-through-writing ambitions he hints at in his early essays is
gone. That's what he means when he says he can't motivate people to change that
way.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But he doesn't talk about motivation in
the interview, he doesn't even really talk about mapping.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>In that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>PPF</i> essay, he uses something like Jameson's cognitive mapping as a
metaphor for what he's attempting to do in poetry.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>The quote in the interview is about
changing political values. And that other piece has much more to do with what
formally constitutes the writing, its possibilities. I don't mean his work hasn't
changed, I just don't see it in those two quotes side by side.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>What I'm responding to in the earlier
quote is the implicit attachment of writing to a notion of Marxist critique,
whereby constructing that kind of knowledge of the social totality, that kind
of social theory, would itself be constitutive of social action, would itself
be a politics. And the question of the effectiveness or agency of the writing
is answered -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Does he say that in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>PPF</i> essay, that cognitive mapping is
itself constitutive of a politics?</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Not political action in the social sense,
but as a more elemental form of politics. What was interesting about that talk
series was the primary opposition or tension that developed between his
position and the one in Erica Hunt's talk. Erica was arguing for a more
grassroots, empowerment sense of the politics of writing, basing it on an
essentially sixties understanding of the new social movements, and in favor of
a then-nascent multicultural project for literature. Bruce says at one point
something to the effect of, I'm just on the point of denying that that is in
any way politically progressive, because that kind of identity politics carried
to an extreme is just a reinforcing mechanism -- what he calls in the interview
a compensatory structure.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I don't know about the Jameson reference,
but it seems to me that Bruce's poetics have always had this Lukácsian element,
the idea that consciousness is the element of political change, so that that
mapping would be part of the consciousness of the poet in the act of writing,
incorporating all this social reference; and here, maybe it's downsized for the
'90s with that &quot;kind of reinforcement of more fragile beliefs or
attitudes,&quot; but the emphasis is still on knowledge of the writer in
relation to the audience as opposed to actual political work.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But there's something else interesting
about that term &quot;reinforcement.&quot; Earlier in Andrews's poetics you get
the sense that writing's not about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reinforcing</i>
anything preexisting in the status quo, it's about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>constituting</i> -- primal, constitutive value-making. It's interesting
that you see Bruce transposing the Althusserian analysis from critical theory
to poetry as the &quot;outside,&quot; the Archimedean point, because it's
there, in his view, that language is at its most generative, that's the
crucible of political possibility, in a completely self-aware poetry. So by
using that term -- I don't know if he'd back off from the claims he makes
earlier, but it does seem to be at least tonally a shift, and significant as a
shift in the language he uses to describe his project.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>You can also see the shift in the way he
goes about constituting the work. Early on, especially in the 1970s, he uses
fragmented words, word groups, whereas later he tends to use whole phrase
structures; the latter seems more a reinforcement of idiomatic language use.
The phonetic stuff, especially <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Love
Songs,</i> is all about building new language units, and after that he starts
using more phrase- and speech-based colloquialisms, language that's already
constituted as social meaning, and piling it on top of each other to address
the politics of meaning, as opposed to creating it.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I think you're right to identify this
Althusserian aspect of Bruce; and it's almost like that's the grad-student
poli-sci hipster in him, where all the scientific jargon comes in, especially
in stuff like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Love Songs,</i> where it's
really only interesting as a kind of attempt to enact a Barthesian pleasure of
the text, and then there's the other work, like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Shut Up,</i> which is incredibly fun to read but has much more to do
with his moral brand of Marxist consciousness of historical processes -- I don't
think he's ever reconciled those two aspects into a single poetics. Since he's
the poet of hyperbole, he's bound to make statements like those at Charles's
New School series that test by their provocativeness, and it's there that their
interest lies, rather than in any truth-content as it might apply to his own
work. . . . </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Actually, in the interview, Andrews
sounds very guarded with Charles, as if he's well aware of the potential for
cooptation in this nice radio series on poets, LineBreak. -- But we should talk
about what it is in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shut Up</i> that is
supposedly addressing consciousness, even at that level -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>It's not addressing, it's acting it out.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Or acting it out: what goes on in that
process.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>That's why I resist the word &quot;mapping,&quot;
because -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>It implies a separate language. So he's
acting out or theatrically inhabiting the consciousness of diverse segments of
society, but curiously you can just about always tell when it's Bruce speaking.
That's the interesting thing about his work; he abjures the &quot;I,&quot; he
abjures subjectivity, and yet it's possible to locate the identifiably
Andrewsian &quot;take&quot; in the mix -- thrown in with all the other jargon,
with the ad language, the soundbites, the weekly news.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>He's a DJ, he's got a thousand records,
and he's getting off on the fact that he's got this massive record collection
with all these things in it. So there's the pretense that it's not his voice,
but . . . </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But you can hear the voice. It's almost
as if that's part of the strategy: he puts in &quot;his&quot; words along with
all the other stuff as a kind of experiment to see how you read it. Someone
once used the metaphor of the &quot;town meeting&quot; for his work, and that
seems to me completely wrong; it's not about a deliberative polyvocality at all
in that sense -- nothing like Rousseau's convocation of the people's voices.
That's not the politics of the work . . .</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>It's not about a consensual agreement, it's
a unidirectional effort on his part.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>It's very much a mode of orchestration,
there's the orchestrating of these energetic clashes between these different
idiolects, clashing snippets of different kinds of language -- in that, I would
compare his technique, strictly at the level of composition, to somebody like
John Zorn, whom he collaborates with. It becomes clear when you make that
analogy that however much he eschews that kind of subjectivity and eschews the
lyric I, it's still very much his composition; in the same sense as in a Zorn
piece like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cobra</i>, where despite the
fact that there's no notative music in it, and it's supposedly structured by
the guided improvisation of the players, it's still very much a John Zorn
composition. That comes through clearly.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>There is this slide back and forth:
between a hatred of ego, of subjectivity -- sort of the major theoretical
aversion of Language writing in the '80s -- and then a return to it, through
the back door so to speak, simply in confronting the principle of selection as
method. In address, in tone, all that stuff, it all comes back to the problem
of individual structuring and its motivation, its vantage point in society.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>That has to do with the how of writing,
what he needed to say in order to write the way he does. It's like when you're
walking on the ledge of a building, if you look down you'll get dizzy and fall,
so you have to avoid looking down in order to do this crazy thing. But
pretending it's not ego or that it's not his own rhetoric or tone allows him to
have this incredible outpouring. If you'd postulated this project in its
details beforehand you'd never have come up with it.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>This seems to be his argument: that there
may be an ego here, but it's not mine. That what's coming out is some other
kind of language than the self's. That the ego you're reading and the ego I
have are two different things. So that in this welter of language trash, the
only ego I'm using is the sorting process, not the culling process.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>That brings up psychology. I mean, if there's
ever a project that's ripe for a psychoanalytic approach, it's Bruce Andrews's.
And it would be interesting to know more about his childhood and all that
stuff. But apart from that, and sort of in the grad student lit-crit manner I
don't mean to be dismissive of here, the ego of the work itself is all psychic
and emotional energy -- sexual violence and so on; it's actually a very narrow
range of emotion. There's a certain kind of violent emotion that seizes
everything else, so once you include a little bit of that, everything turns
into it, like a few colors mixed turn black . . .</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>It's like watching TV, only you don't have
any control over the TV, it turns on its own -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Or someone else is sitting on the couch
with your clicker.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>And you're totally powerless, it's really
frustrating, but it's also funny. What sense it makes is outside the context of
the language.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Well, to address <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Shut Up,</i> and it's true that the tonal range is relatively narrow --
which might explain his later shift to a more lyrical sense of language in the
Dante project, which hasn't come out yet in its entirety -- but what I've
always liked in this work is precisely the sardonic attack, the no-holds-barred
satirical thrust of good parts of the book. I don't know about the melodramatic
back-cover copy where &quot;the poet angrily proclaims,&quot; etc. -- that
makes it sound straighter than it is. It's less interesting where he reverts to
his old micro-focus on word clusters. There's the snide commentary: &quot;He
has arrogance of ignorance, not so great . . .&quot; But then: &quot;metal
servile,&quot; etc., which seems to slow it up. It's at the social level, when
it's phrase-based, or even sentence-based -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>I wouldn't call it sentence-based. It's
that there are two different phrases that are put together to form a sentence
of sorts; that's where most of the really funny syntheses are in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shut Up,</i> where two sentences are cut up
and their parts spliced elsewhere.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But it's not in the suture itself, it's
in the recognizable voice of &quot;He has arrogance . . .&quot; If it's too discrete,
too much cut-and-splice, the homogeneity of the language gets revealed very
quickly, it becomes a blur in the less interesting sense; it lessens the
purchase you get on his material.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>See, those are the judgments that Bruce's
work depends on. Against the argument that it's all the same, it's boring, it's
all a blur, he needs people to say I like this one and not this one, because
then that's what transforms it into his own lifework: &quot;Yeah I like <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cobra </i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>but not this,&quot; etc. So that's exactly the response that he
wants, in order for it to be what Charles talks about when he mentions &quot;recuperation
as literature.&quot; He needs to be recuperated as literature; or else what is
it.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span

are the claims for the work. That's the contradiction you keep coming up
against. The claim is not that it's poetry . . .</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>Well what are the claims of this later
work, then?</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>To put it in Bruce Andrews's terms, the
claim is that it's $13.95. You know, the capitalist market thing; in other
words, it has to be worth your time to buy it and read it and think about it.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>So is that what's being recuperated, the
$13.95? I think whether or not this would get recuperated as part of the
literary tradition is if it would be worth reading . . .</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>It depends on whether you want to cede
the notion of this writing as transcending the generic limitations of &quot;poetry,&quot;
which he acknowledges as being a restrictive institutional construct. I
maintain that you can do that with anybody, Bruce Andrews not excepted.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Do what?</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Treat it as ultimately literary writing,
unpack the claim that it's categoryless, that it's about overthrowing
literature altogether.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>But he doesn't say that. He doesn't write
generic writing or non-generic writing, he's just writing <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>writing</i>. Something that's looking primarily at language and not at
other aspects of writing. And that gets reconstituted or appropriated or
co-opted by the literary structure. He isn't writing outside of literature.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>That's what I'm saying. I'm saying it's
not necessarily cooptation. Think about the Dada stance. They would be utterly
contemptuous -- &quot;$13.95 from Sun and Moon, no thanks, I'd rather throw
paper airplanes at the Cabaret Voltaire.&quot; Andrews is not about that, he
has a much more nuanced or mediated understanding of what his work is doing.
And ultimately that lends itself to a literary recuperation. You'd think, from
reading the poetics, he'd want to deny that.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I meant something slightly different from
that. Partly because I don't give a shit about revolutionary politics, or if
anything I'm against them, I feel completely free to ignore that whole aspect
of Bruce's work. So instead I see the two poles as being either, it's a
critical intervention in a certain arena in which poetry is one aspect of
critical theory or political science; or on the other hand, it's literature,
meaning therefore the pleasures of the reader. I don't really believe that
these two things are so distinct, but Bruce seems to operate between these two
poles. From the point of view of critical intervention, the problem his work
comes up against is that it all sounds the same, there's no development of
ideas; we started out by trying to figure out if there's a shift in the work,
and maybe there's one big shift, but it's not like with the different Derrida
books where in one he analyzes Heidegger and the question of spirit and in the
other he analyzes Kierkegaard and the logic of sacrifice. You can't say with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shut Up</i> Bruce is dealing with the Reagan
years but in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Love Songs</i> it's really
the second-term Nixon. . . . So as critical intervention, the only interest is
the idea of the project, and the actual books are irrevelant. But he doesn't
want the books to be irrevelant, so he has to have them recuperated as
literature in order for it to be worth his while to have done 50 or 100, 000
pages of it. And so that's what I see as his double bind.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I think that may go along with the
somewhat more modest claims being made in the interview as opposed to the
address in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>PPF</i>. That sort of
recognition, that there's always that sort of institutional embeddedness to
characterize the work, it's always recuperable to some genre or institution of
poetic writing, or anti-poetic writing, or whatever. It's very characteristic
of a lot of writers from that particular group loosely constituted [laughter]
as Language writing. In recent years they've had to come to the realization of
their own writing as institutionally embedded, as co-opted by considerations of
genre, academic or other institutional protocols, etc., and sort of having to
back off from some of those claims for a pre-generic kind of writing, or a
writing beyond genre, and recognize the strictures that are placed on the act
of writing regardless of whether the intent is to undermine genre or speak to a
more total notion of the social. People are having to deal with these questions
of the specificity of institutional power, and that comes up in the interview,
which is another thing I wouldn't have expected to hear Bruce Andrews say in
the mid-'80s, talking about the necessity of dealing with the strictures posed
by certain institutional contexts, having to deal with specific institutional
powers as opposed to the social as the broadest possible horizon.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>That's a problematic way of recasting the
&quot;oppositional&quot; in oppositional poetics, because for one thing, it's
not as if there were no institutions around this work when it began to come
out. Bruce's work, for example, came out of a context that included Michael
Lally's writing workshop in DC in the late '60s, and later Bernadette Mayer's
workshop at the Poetry Project in New York; those are the scenes within which
he defined his own project, as well as the backdrop of the whole visual arts
scene -- mediated certainly by powerful institutions -- which he's described as
being much more radical and adventurous than virtually any writing being done
at the same time. It's freer and easier to be moving away from institutions you're
not affiliated with than it is to work within those you are.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I like this idea, though, that there's
been a backing off from the earlier claims; can you say more about that?</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>The quote that really got me thinking
along those lines was this: &quot;The scope of this embraces the overall social
body, the contested hegemonies on the map, the whole that needs altering, a
total which is close to the 'false'. . . . In its own workings, writing can
offer a more intimate grasp of this totality.&quot; And that idea of horizon
and of totality is repeated consistently throughout the piece.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>What is he claiming that poetry is doing
with regard to that totality?</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>That it can provide in some sense a total
map of the social.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I mean, is it like a urine sample of the
social, or something, that you could then study and figure out . . .</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>He does talk about it simultaneously as &quot;explanation&quot;
and as &quot;praxis&quot; -- &quot;Poetry as Explanation, Poetry as Praxis&quot;
-- the bifurcation neatly sums it up. There's understanding as goal,
understanding how you have all the numerous conflicts in society at large
operating nonetheless under a single systemic limit or sign-boundary; and then
there's a practical intervention into it -- and that's the utopian side of the
project.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>The intervention I understand, it's the
explanation part I don't quite get. Does it say more explicitly how that's the
case, in that piece? The work is not discursive; that seems like a hard limit.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I'm not pointing to a congruence between
what's actually achieved by the work and the claims that are made for it in the
poetics, just the claims themselves.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I like the idea of like, we're the
revolutionary tribunal, we're in the era of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marat/Sade</i>;
you know, &quot;Comrade Andrews has claimed that his work can explain the
totality of the social. Is there anyone in his defense? Off with his head!&quot;</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>&quot;In its own workings, writing can
offer a more intimate grasp of this totality: expanding to the limit the
contextual horizon within which you can imagine meaning &amp; sense being
produced and realized.&quot;</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>He's giving us the ground with which we
could make an explanation. But, you know, easier said than done.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But that grasp immediately becomes an
intervention. In the next sentence: &quot;Even if the horizon celebrates itself
as openness, I doubt we can locate its limits without challenging them, without
attempting to set up something outside.&quot; So immediately this project of
mapping the social is in turn a project of contesting the limits of the social,
by virtue of its ability to embrace a totality; to see that as what he calls
later &quot;an agitated totality.&quot; A unity constituted by a contradiction,
or something like that.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Well I'm with him totally if we talk
about gathering samples, creating a ground with which we could do some work
with that, that would make it easier to do a certain kind of work with what he's
gathered from the social totality. But the explanation part seems to fall
through the cracks.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I think the former possibility is much
more in line with what he says in the interview with Charles, that it's
particularized in the sense that he recognizes, if nothing else, an empirical
limitation of the writing, that the single act of writing is not going to image
the social, that it will be a collection of samples and necessarily limited by
the range of that collection: how far afield do I go to collect samples, how
open can my ears be, how much can I process.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>When I first read the work in the '80s,
and I had no idea about the poetics advanced alongside it, I thought of
hip-hop. The energy is all focused on a particularly public kind of utterance,
or private-made-public, usually street argot or the kind of language from
conversations in bars, etc. -- relatively little so-called reflective or
intimate speech. It's triangulated in its approach to the reader by the sense
of its projection into, or derivation from, public space, with a potential
audience in the background, like playground or locker-room talk -- an implicit
theatricality. And yet the dynamic remains primarily intersubjective; that
public triangulation is what creates its particular orbit on the page. He's not
as interested in institutional language as Charles is, for instance; with Bruce
it's much more about raiding the vernacular.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>But we always end up talking about the
later work; in the early work he does sound more personal, does use situations
of small groups talking. He's working with a smaller linguistic base, working
with words and sounds in an intimate way. . . . It's more about acoustic
relationships, about the politics of typography, than about society as a whole.
. . .</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I would want to insert a parenthesis; I
think there is a difference between the earlier work and the later, but I don't
think we can talk about the differences as, one is personal and the other is
social; maybe the relationship between the personal and the social is
different, but if we're going to take seriously the consequences of our
argument contesting the claim that there's no ego in the work, that it's been
eradicated -- if you follow that out to its logical conclusion, then the social
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> personal and the social material
in this work is as much a way of expressing what's personal as the personal is
a way of getting access to the social. The subtitle &quot;Social Romanticism&quot;
-- you can treat it as a joke, but I think of it as a serious claim that to
some extent also undermines -- if a claim is being made in that [<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>PPF</i>] lecture about the work in terms of
its sociality, in terms of a social intervention, then it's undercut by this
subtitle; the lecture isn't dealing with the other side of the equation. By
repressing &quot;personal,&quot; it seems to be repressing half of what the
work is about.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>There is this residue in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shut Up</i> of the sort of peripatetic
movement of pastoral, which is undercut by its alphabetic organization, and by
the constant undercutting of the possibility of any sort of continuous lyric
voice, but there is still this sort of cinematic image I always get of the poet
strolling through the city. And in that sense, questions of subjectivity aren't
always bracketed out in a total way; that's the social romanticism, that it's a
romantic version of the social.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>NL<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>The title itself questions the link
between those two worlds at the same time it draws them together. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up; Or,
Social Romanticism.</i> &quot;Or&quot;? Or &quot;equals&quot;? In both the
interview and the lecture Bruce seems to be shying away from the more
interesting, disturbing implications of the personal-political commutative
principle in favor of a resettling of notions of project or oeuvre. If that's
the case, the question becomes how much do we buy this modernist narrative of
development -- from the quantum-level micro-technics of word and phoneme
explored in the '70s, to the more fully social horizoning of language-use
undertaken in the '80s and '90s. I don't see that as a narrative of
Greenbergian necessity the way he presents it -- you know, first you start with
the atom, and once you've learned all about that you can move on to the water
molecule.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>It's not a necessity except in the sense
of a necessary fiction for undertaking the work. Yes, the personal is there, it's
always there, but the importance of the early work is that it enabled him to
get a hold on language, what it looks like, how it sounds, to fiddle with its
elements without worrying about &quot;making sense&quot; conventionally; and
this carries over to the later work where the phrases or sentences make surface
sense but include that other sense of play, that childish grapple with language
as matter . . . </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But what I think Nick is suggesting is
that the narrative he gives doesn't -- it's true as far as it goes, but it
doesn't account for how he got to this. It's as if I were to ask you, How did
you get to graduate school, how did you decide to get a Ph.D., and you said,
Well, I was living in California and I bought a plane ticket to Buffalo. It's
true, and it says something maybe about the way Bruce thinks that he would
account for it this way, but it doesn't really account for the work. What's
always struck me about Bruce -- and that's why I see a continuity between the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>PPF</i> lecture and this -- is that the work
has always seemed more interesting than the claims. The claims have never
seemed to me grandiose; they've always seemed incredibly banal, like as if
somehow I could hold up a mirror to the totality, that would be interesting; as
if I'd rather read that than read a Superman comicbook. The work has always
been compelling in its own very weird way, and Bruce has always seemed to me to
be at a loss to account for what makes it compelling.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I think that it's that bumping up of a
vastly expanded range of social reference, and whether he gets that to a social
totality or not, we do have to agree that he does incorporate a vastly wider
range of social reference than what we're accustomed to think of as involved in
writing poetry -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>But less than some poets, whom we don't
think of talking about in that way. I guarantee you that there's less social
reference in Bruce than in Robert Kelly's work. We don't think of Robert Kelly
as being this grand poet of the social totality -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>WH<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>But Robert Kelly doesn't juxtapose wildly
disparate -- </p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I'm just saying, it's true there are a
lot of strange things in Bruce's poems that we're not used to seeing in poetry,
but that's not what makes them unique. I could list ten poets who also have an
incredible range; Pablo Neruda, for whom it was very important to have a poetry
that would include, in his formulation, you know, butterflies and rivers -- in
any case, there's a lot of reference there and it's global in a way that Bruce's
isn't. Bruce's is America. I don't want to define it as being stuck, it's just
that that doesn't seem to me ipso facto what makes the work compelling.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>TB<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>What is interesting about the work is
that bumping up against each other of, on the one hand, that urge toward
expansion, range, a broad field of reference, and on the other, the limits
imposed by compositional strategy, or context in whatever sense, whether it's
the context of the book that the piece is published in, or relating it to prior
works by Bruce or contemporaneous works by people associated with him -- that
for me is what's most interesting about the work, the sort of strains and
blockages that are created by the particularizing stops in the work. And I
think you're right, it's something that, in his claims for the work, he
addresses very little.</p>

<p class=text style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-pagination:none'>BF<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>I get off on the ugliness myself. I don't
think I've ever seen a poetry that's as unrelievedly ugly as Bruce's. I mean, a
Philip Levine book is infinitely uglier and tawdrier, but it seems completely
blind to its own ugliness; Bruce has a loving attitude about the vulgarity and
the coarseness and the profanity. That -- that's actually enough.</p>
