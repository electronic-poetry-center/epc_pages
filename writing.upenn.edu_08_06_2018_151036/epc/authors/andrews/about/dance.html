Spoken poetry and the mute language of the body merged in provocative ways
in "Crease," an improvisation by the poet Bruce Andrews and the dancer and
choreographer Sally Silvers, on Thursday night at the Whitney Museum of
American Art at Philip Morris. The evening, part of the museum's
imaginative "Impulsive Behavior" series, also featured performances by the
poets Charles Bernstein and Edwin Torres, whose act included percussion by
Sean Blacklung.<P>


Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Andrews are founding members of the experimentalist
Language Poetry movement, which focuses not on subject matter or form but
on the material of language and the ways language produces meaning. One
might expect this approach to be antithetical to the metaphorical heart of
dance. But Ms. Silvers and Mr. Andrews are longtime collaborators, and
together they produced a more expansive kind of metaphor.<P>
One of the pleasures of "Crease" was its amusing juxtaposition of two
distinctively different presences. Mr. Andrews had a kind of Midwestern
solidity and amiability as he calmly juggled fragmentary spoken phrases
and recorded words and sounds. Ms. Silvers was pure New York: a little
worried looking but concentrating on her wayward progress with dogged
acuity.<P>
Dressed first in a scruffy pink party dress and black army boots and later
in black cutoff tights and a black shirt with an inspired sheen of red,
Ms. Silver looked like an urban wraith as she perched, reclined, hung
from, inched and darted across and slid along every flat surface and
railing in the performance space.<P>
Disappearing at times, then popping up in another spot, bathed in pinkish
light that followed her, she served as an anchor in a sea of non-sequiturs
that ranged from "Stretch marks on what's left of your ethics" to
"Exacerbate me, babe." When it was time to stop, she wrapped herself
around Mr. Andrews and his impromptu marble podium and then tugged at his
arm like a small, impatient child. Too often ill-advised, improvisation
here opened a window on two yeasty, authoritative artists.<P>
