The titles of the poems are       taken from their first lines, and are arranged alphabetically,       thus detracting from the emphasis usually placed on the titles       of poems. Many of the titles are, nonetheless, provocative;       "All My Friends are Dead", "America Shops", "Am I Alive?",       "Animal Dicks in Bed", and "Anti-Enlightenment" are the first       five. This confrontational attitude is generally       characteristic of the text of <I>Shut Up</I>, and yet the titles do       not begin to hint at the nature of the delirious, vicious,       irresolute, aggravating and aggavated poems that follow them.</P>       <P><I>Shut Up</I> may be the apotheosis of the last possible mode of       socio-critical poetry available to those of the "avant-garde,"       or at least to those who do not think that simplified       reiterations of the major themes of "progressive" social       discourse are legitimate avenues of expression. In many ways       <I>Shut Up</I> can also be seen as the elaboration of a persona,       though the definition of "persona" would have to be modified       to include "anything that speaks," meaning that one needn't       attribute the voice to a historical or fictional being       (Bertrans de Born in Pound's "Sestina Altaforte", for       instance) but can attribute it, instead, to a mode of       discourse. An initial characterization of Andrews' persona in       <I>Shut Up</I> could begin with Charles Bernstein's definition (cited       in Marjorie Perloff's <I>Radical Artifice</I>) of "imagabsorption" as       "'the im-position of the image on the mind' from without."       Baudrillard's idea of the "ecstasy of communication," in which       "the scene and mirror no longer exist; instead, there is a       screen and network," our time being a "narcissistic and       protean era of connections, contact, contiguity, feedback and       generalized interface that goes with the universe of       communication," is also valuable here. In any case, in <I>Shut Up</I>       there is a voice being elaborated, one that seems as much       governed by the barrage of images, words and rhythms (often       originating from the impersonal, merciless realm of mass       media) that compose its speech as it is by the momentary       caprices of the poet's personality. Thus, <I>Shut Up</I> is a drama       of sorts, though with no protagonist.</P>       <P>The following is from <Q><Q>If Pods Could Talk</Q></Q>:</P><BR><BLOCKQUOTE><P>            If pods could talk &#8212; so, how<BR>            about a sperm-a-thon?

(120)<BR><BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>       <P>If there is comedy here, it is not so much in the individual       phrases (many of which seem tasteless in-jokes, like those       uttered by the over-drunk at parties) but in the fact that it       just doesn't stop. Many of the phrases can be read as fairly       self-conscious comments on the text itself: "so how/ about a       sperm-a-thon?" (highlighting the "masturbatory" element), and       "Quality is depressing," (meaning that the gracious is       something hypocritical) are most apparent. "Chill my crack"       sounds like something kids would yell to an elder they are       trying to offend; "Hardy Boys save the Third World in the       comfort of their own home" sounds like a headline, but is also       an acrid commentary on certain bourgeois liberal practises of       the day. "Invest in the retarded" also sounds like something       from a newspaper, but the clause following places it somewhere       within the realm of some academic discourse. Even the linking       of the word "invest," which has connotations of money, with       such a phrase as "the retarded" resonates to encompass notions       of present-day practises of, for instance, obtaining cheap       labor under the guise of philanthropy. <I>Shut Up</I> is relentless       and often brutal, and may even be thought of as a study of       end-of-the century misanthropy. It's virtue, however, besides       the richness of the language and imagery, is that it is not       hermetic, and in fact exhibits a terrific appetite for the       "real," abstract as its expression may be. It is an unusual       and rich book, and will no doubt be talked about for years to       come.</P>              [<Q>St. Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter</Q>, December 1993/January       1994)]</BODY></HTML>
