It wascomposed in the mid-80s.  A decade before, in the mid-70s, Andrews andCharles Bernstein had co-founded <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</I> Magazine.  Thischallenged the influential breath-based poetics of Charles Olson's greatclarion call of 1950, "Projective Verse":<P> <BLOCKQUOTE> the HEAD, by way of the EAR, to the SYLLABLE the HEART,by way of the BREATH, to the LINE<SUP>1 </SUP></P> </BLOCKQUOTE><P> Here, alertness to the body's pulsings as it interacts with theoutside, secures performance's authenticity.  But the "Language poets"had just come through the Civil Rights and Vietnam War years, and hadread their Marcuse.  They focused rather on the ideological andtechnical dimensions already built into physical responses, as well asshaping what speech act theory calls 'performative utterances,' that is,utterances that have effects in the world.<SUP>2</SUP> </P><P> This is from the first poem of <I>I Don't Have Any Paper,</I> "Allof My Friends Are Dead."  It surely responds, among other things, to theopening line of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" (1955-6) - "I saw the best mindsof my generation destroyed by madness, starving hystericalnaked..."<SUP>3</SUP> </P><P> <BLOCKQUOTE> All of my friends are dead &#8212; too bad for them; whichwas in <BR>practice little more than banging one inadequate category <BR>againstanother.  Step on the advice of his children. <BR>Communication <BR>justifiesthe derelict headquarters at 2 Dzerzhinsky Square, <BR>Moscow, infinitesimalhot line to God, though formally asso- <BR>ciated in the medieval trivium,Israeli cabinet tastes like Mom. <BR>White gardenia what unspeakably sweetpoke loyalty decline. <BR>Set yourself on fire to avoid homework.

Pimples are supernumer- <BR>ary; conquistadoreswould have planted Burpee seeds.<SUP>4</SUP> </P> </BLOCKQUOTE><P> In the course of this paper I'll repeat this passage twice.Hopefully, on each re-hearing, more dimensions of it will becomeapparent.  The "medieval <I>trivium</I>," for instance, was the groupedstudies of grammar, rhetoric, and logic, and later meant a crossing ofthree roads. "Israeli cabinet tastes like Mom" sounds like aninterjection from Woody Allen. </P> <BR> <P> <H4>Bridgings</H4> </P><BR><P> Call "space" that which prevents 2 or more Archimedean objects fromoccupying the same place at the same time.  From the beginnings of humanspeech, therefore, space was inhabited by ghosts whose 'dimensions,' hadit been a geometer, it couldn't even have construed as such.  For itcould be summer, but they're talking about winter.  Poetry began as atechnical means of remembering, among other things, winter.  "Kora inHell" was William Carlos Williams' term for winter in 1920, drawing on aGreek myth of the seasons. </P><P> The Greeks had an origin-myth for geometry, too.  Thales calculatedthe pyramids' height by their shadows, just when his own shadow was aslong as he was tall.  Two abstract diagonals, from head, to head ofshadow. Identical triangles different in scale.  Volume is needed forthe sun to cast the shadows.  But geometrical representations rendervolume transparent.  Not until the 1820s, with the development ofnon-Euclidean geometries, do the mysteries of volume return.  In thewords of Michel Serres, </P><P> <BLOCKQUOTE> The right angle, the plane, the volume, their intervalsand their areas, will be recognized as chaotic, dense, compact - againteeming with folds and dark hiding places<SUP>.5</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE></P><P> The pure representation can no longer exhaust the object byremaining separate from it.  Between them isn't space, but zones ofmutual contamination, interactive lines of uncertain breadth, asuncertain as space itself now is.  And faster-moving. </P><P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <Q>There is only one thing</Q>, Olson says, "[poetry] can doabout kinetic, reenact it."<SUP>6</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE> </P><P> And we find there's a particular kind of understanding linked to theevanescences of speed.  Move too slow, and you start to lose suchconnections. </P><BR> <P> <H4>Gaps</H4> </P> <BR><P> Clearly, Andrews' is a writing of extreme discontinuities, not onlyfrom phrase to phrase, but even within seeming phrasal units.  And itmoves with a speed no voice could sustain in real time.  But could,aided by text, in the real time of performance. </P><P> In a radio interview of 1996, Andrews recounted his method ofcomposition to Charles Bernstein: </P> <P> <BLOCKQUOTE> ... to generatelarge amounts of material on very small pieces of paper &#8212; one, two,three, four, five words at a time, in clusters, short fragments ofphrases, or pre-phrases, and then compose the work, sometimes muchlater... than when I had written the raw materials, into works based ona whole series of other decisions that I'll make later, so it's morelike editing film footage.  So that the editing process becomes thecomposing process.  Or that's what gets focused on, more than some kindof point-of-inspiration moment that I actually wrote the wordson.<SUP>7</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE> </P><P> Discontinuous phrases, interactive lines of uncertain breadth.  Whatgaps do they cross, and how?  It's a difficult question, because gapsseem produced in the first place through violations of continuity-rulesof writing.  But there's also a pressure exerted by what exceeds boththe immediate writing, and the later composing/editing: a pressure, anda getting-in-there. </P><P> Archimedean space keeps hard objects unmixed.  But since theelectric telegraph, technologies have been usurping word and thought inbringing what's <I>not</I> there together with what is.  What's newabout this is the immediate transmission over distance, and look at thematerial <I>lag</I> of the line in even saying that.  "Sentences areshort," Andrews writes, "words are long." (74)<SUP>8</SUP> </P><P> Today, electronic communications systems <I>do not map onto</I> theone-time physical centers called cities (in Andrews' case, New York).And the scales of measurement, as Paul Virilio insists, "share no commonground."<SUP>9</SUP>  Yet he adds that sensory reality and video realityare received as an instantaneous continuum, although in the one, isdepth of field, in the other, the baffling depth of imploded time.(30-1) Screened images are thus, precisely, <I>blindingly</I> obvious.<I>Between the line</I> of exposure/invisibility, lies a strangedensity, which the standard task of jump-cuts is to erase.  Here is thesecurity: anything can be joined.  There <I>are</I> no gaps. Neither ofthe grand models of time, linear or cyclical, will hack thisincontinence of techno-space-times. Obviously, this poses peculiarproblems for any concept of repetition. </P> <BR> <P> <H2>Voicing(2)</H2> </P> <BR><P> I<I> Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up</I> consists of 100 x 3-pagepoems. Excess is its very principle.  I'll now 'peculiarly repeat' thepassage I read earlier: </P> <BLOCKQUOTE><P> Just let it burn itself on the bulb &#8212; cross-hatched pudenda <BR>chloralsto cause pneumonia; chirpy cha-cha, helicopters are <BR>fat &#8212; buff's over.War = a money tune-up <BR>why so communicate scratch to shit: patsy pubes,wizards of <BR>ooze &#8212; I was injured in the act of eliminating civilians.

(168-9) </BLOCKQUOTE> </P> <BR><P> <H4>Mechanical Dances Typology</H4> </P> <BR><P> Exposure to this writing can be like trying to follow a MerceCunningham dance without a vocabulary for the movements.  Here, then, isa gesture towards a notation of some of the kinds of phrases andkinetics, often overlapping, that Andrews uses: </P><BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Delayed precision</I>.  "Just let it burn itself onthe bulb."  Presumably a reference, sadistic or indifferent, to a moth.Recognition is delayed because another phrase &#8212; a metaphor, "burn itselfout" &#8212; is ghosted or provoked here. </P> </BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Immediate supports.</I>  Such ghostings &#8212; "Suck my loan," or lessdefinitely, "Set yourself on fire to avoid homework," like the puns("wizards of ooze"), supply an instant, oblique support to the wordsconcerned. </BLOCKQUOTE> </P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Remoteparticulars.</I>  "Step on the advice of his children."  "Step on" isthe niggling oddness here.  It's as if the words offer to secure the<I>particularity</I> of a tenuously obscure scenario by the anomalies theystrike.  Is the phrase recalled, and its mystery deepened, by "maletriplets as floor samples"?  Andrews works to keep the words fromcollapsing into the disappointment of complete decoding, as happens sooften, for instance, with the early experimentalist, Arthur Rimbaud.  Sooften, to make an Andrews phrase (or "pre-phrase") mean something, wehave to make uneasy allowances &#8212; to fit what it <I>might</I> mean to the words'stubbornly odd conjunction.  Alternately, even to mentally change a word- a verb, say, from singular to plural, which promptly snaps back.  Bywhich time we're so far out on a limb that it, like a cartoon limb, hasvanished.  It's a kind of counter-entropy. </P> </BLOCKQUOTE><P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <I>Sloganese. </I> Sudden phrases where we recognisethe words &#8212; "parachute plagiarism" - and may have accepted theircombination before realising we don't understand it.  And see thus, howeasily slogans are coined. (Headline: "PARACHUTE PLAGIARISM NOWNATIONWIDE.") </BLOCKQUOTE> </P><P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <I>Syntactical propulsions</I>.  Use of punctuation &#8212;especially the dash and colon &#8212; to suggest an equivalence or aconsequence that the actual phrases seem to belie: "helicopters are fat&#8212; buff's over."  Elsewhere, the <I>recognizability</I> of the succeeding phraseoffers to render forgettable the obscurity of the ones preceding.  Suchpropulsive techniques were first developed by Williams in <I>Kora in Hell: Improvisations</I>.<SUP>10</SUP>  To call it simply specious is to evade theissue. Andrews is unpacking ways <I>generally</I> used to make languageeffective, and the cooperative choices, on the auditor's part, that thatactually requires &#8212; unpacking them to the very brink, but never beyondit, of rhetoric itself.  It's a veritable compendium of means oflinguistic manipulation currently operative. </BLOCKQUOTE> </P><P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <I>Confrontations.</I>  "[Y]ou want <I>everyone</I> to applaudyour self-absorption." No one is entirely immune &#8212; either from thecharge, or from the desire to <I>deliver</I> the charge.  It puts guilt incontext, while forever losing innocence.  And the voice hectors for anengaged response. </P> </BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Aphorisms</I>.  "Lose weight through cyanide" (169);"<I>regret</I> is like the processed cheese of the emotions." (23)  Smartnessesthat the fury pulsing throughout the book always bids to deform.  Thehumor that likewise permeates the book, is politically necessitated,quite visibly, while the particular voice that it issues from is everuncertain.  (The word "I" in these poems is a linguistic device ratherthan a sign of self-expression.)  "All of my friends are dead &#8212; too badfor them." </P> </BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Dictionarymultipliers.</I>  "[C]ross-hatched pudenda chlorals."  Looking up"chloral" brings in DDT as well as a sedative or knockout drug.  Themeanings of "bunt" &#8212; "each handles its bunts" - range from part of asail through a fishing-net to a baseball term to part of a wheatattacked by fungus.  This multiplies not only the given phrase'spossible meanings, but also (mightn't the dictionary multiply any word?&#8212; and the vocabulary range is immense) the passage's potential trippingsinto endlessness. </P> </BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Thematicstabilizers/Adequacies of the inadequate</I>.  Through repeatedallusions and suggestions, tenuous stabilizings of meaning start to runboth forward and back.  "[B]lessing to be a former virgin.  Wet mebrown; clods eeling prep nationalists."  Here a sexual initiation,perhaps of young Reaganites ("prep"/"preppie"), carries overtones offecal mud, rung up later in "Jab bog" and at multiple points throughoutthe book.  The burning moth will get drawn into the associative field ofa militaristic mind-set: "I was injured in the act of eliminatingcivilians," and so on.  Each instance seems flattish.  This in itselfmight lead us to invest them with a surplus energy, trying to <I>pull</I> themup.  But cumulatively, we might also realize that there is no 'rising inlanguage to the occasion' without betraying the occasion to the purplethrill of the language itself.  So, the adequacy of the repeatedlyinadequate.  Celine was the first master of this, as Julia Kristevaunderstood, probing his "oral" techniques of writing in <I>Powers of Horror</I>(1982).<SUP>11</SUP> </P> </BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Phrasal mergers/gaps</I>.  "[W]hy so communicatescratch to shit."  The developing associative potentials force anecessary undecidability: either there is a flow of meaning here &#8212;perhaps along the lines of the <I>look</I> of a dried scratch - or this is oneof those random conjunctions of partial phrases, "pre-phrases" again, inAndrews' term, from diverse sources.  Yes, informational incontinence isforever producing these along the non-Archimedean sensory-videocontinuum.  But it's hairier to see this mimicked in a book of poetry.Andrews makes wildly heteroclite references available for poetry, atonce <I>aping</I> and <I>contesting</I> the shit-machine of data. </P> </BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Thick words</I>.  These again interrupt the line'sintegration to a continuity of meaning: "smile which coons patroltripe."  It's a kind of material engorgement of techno-space-times, thearchitectural city embraced by electronic infinities, and secreting inits volumes, moment to moment, its own infinities.  Speed and stall,traffic and blockage, become the performing voice's own excessivecontent, and the conditions of its dynamic.  And in this insistence of'short sentences and long words,' we grasp again how <I>tenuous</I> are theproductions of meaning, in relation to the words used.  Line, and theline's points, its words. The dimension of the blindingly obvious thatelectronic images have inserted <I>between the line of</I> writing, becomes atonce <I>visibly</I> blinding, and charged with an immense surplus of <I>potential</I>meanings. </P> </BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE> <P> <I>Overloadings.</I>  "Jabbog/ tilt sir fame debt as mercury speak winter through acetylenekindness..."  Suddenly: a cluster of substantives, without theconjunctions, prepositions, subject-verb structures that give yourregular sentence its element of the unimploded.  Too much is too strangehere in too short a time.  Regularly, indeed - but not in synch - we nodin and out of attention, only to realize that every combination had itstreasures, now perhaps lost forever, but others keep rushing in.  Thelistener inserts a certain physiologically demanded resistance, even asthe voice/text plays its own game of stranding, hustling, changingvoices, rebuffing, varying phrase-times, interspersing challengingexhortations to which we have to respond in real conditions of <I>motion</I>.</P> </BLOCKQUOTE><P> So, delayed precisions, immediate supports, remote particulars,losses of limbs, syntactical propulsions, aphorisms, thick words, andmany other types of phrasing, made kinetic by rhythms of combining andrecombining.  Repetitions of the typology lend a structural stabilityalmost drowned in the gnarled, insistent oddness of phrase after phrase.Again and again: figures not coincident with objects; <I>potentiality</I> as alive dimension, and the very condition, of meaning.<SUP>12</SUP>  Thisis the real-abstract: meanings in the situational architectures intechno-space-times. </P> <BR> <P> <H4>Passages</H4> </P> <BR><P> I've offered, as a performance, an unpacking of Andrews' phrasings,reliant on time spent elsewhere poring over the text itself, underivablefrom listening to it read aloud.  It's one more incommensurability,brought into the non-Archimedean field of here and now: across how manygaps, to this point? </P><P> Line, point, voice.  Where <I>are</I> we, here <I>or</I> there?  As WalterBenjamin knew, a city is where people and things get lost.<SUP>13</SUP>But say there inheres in Andrews' lines, with their diminished powers ofcontinuous integration, and in his points, his words, a new uncertaintyabout what location even <I>is</I>.  For in the present symmetry-breakingfields, as Paul Virilio again notes, </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> [t]he dimensional dissection of classical geometry - where the pointcut the line, and the line cut the plane, which then cut through thesolids - has lost a critical part of its practical utility. ... Whatbecomes noteworthy, then, is the recuperated importance of the point...as if the 0 dimension suddenly retrieved its numerical significance...(32-3) </P> </BLOCKQUOTE><P> These were Kandinsky's terms in <I>Point and Line to Plane </I>(1926),groping for a vocabulary for the notation of abstract art.  But alreadyin the ambit &#8212; or prescient &#8212; of a cultural groping (wartime aerialphotographs, for instance) toward bits, pixels, and their endless,momentary, fractal integrations.  But now, without absolute source oroverview, repetition ghosts less a time-line, than an insistence, orpersistence, dispersed across fields of incommensurables.  Ideologyitself, in its rhetorical instances, is less content than persistence,or its content is, overwhelmingly, its saturating persistence.  This isthe quasi-baffled recognition Ginsberg came to, in his attack on theVietnam War in "Wichita Vortex Sutra"(1966).<SUP>14</SUP>  Two decades later,Andrews, then, must attack his targets without possible culmination -misogyny, militaristic competitiveness, the Christian and moralcowardice that craves <I>innocence</I> at all costs, complaceny with theabsence of all gaps, and many, many more. </P><P> This poetics is a micro-politics of experience, because it alsoattaches itself to the human bodies that remain interruptivetransmission- and emission-points (points of transformation).  Bodiescrossing distances that still take mortal time to negotiate.  And whoknow that a writing which opens up to an excess of endlessnesses, offerspassage to talk with another kind of death.  We glimpse the lining ofinformational entropy, the great threatened succumbing of the late 20thcentury.  And we glimpse one condition on which this glimpse, bothexhilarating and terrifying, is taken: that the poet can <I>sustain</I> hisrapid-turnover micro-inventiveness. </P> <BR> <H4><P> Voicing (3) </P></H4> <BR> <P> There is no perverse self-indulgence here, rather aninterventionary range of precise difficulties, of general pertinence.Now the poem can be the experience of itself, both initial and repeated,in real time. </P><BLOCKQUOTE> <P> Only the ego can pick up a pencil covers a tight fist,yes, <BR>ouvriesme; garter belt checks blood flow.
