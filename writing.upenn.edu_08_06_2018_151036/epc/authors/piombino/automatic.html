<font size=6>Automatic Manifesto

<!-- ---------------------------- -->

	Start with the thought that to start with a  thought and allow
the pressure to think of the thought to dissolve. To say what the
thought was to dissolve. To let the pressure dissolve. This dissolving
is a solution, one solution. That it trails off into the screech of
tires at a distance.<br>
<br>
	A practical solution to the problem of the subject is
something I just forgot. It just dissolved.<br>
<br>
	The truth of a life. This life of truth is studded with traps-
stutters and fumbles. And I mumble...<br>
<br>
	But to go forward, despite the anxieties and doubts, step by
step, unflinchingly. Yet I flinch. Unconsciously I avoid the absurd:
which frequently contains the treasure. It would be absurd. Still, I
try to understand, and do understand something, anything. At a
distance, a mournful horn. And I remember...<br>
<br>
	The irony of the situation of contemporary poetry  consists of
its self-conscious, yet unconscious, imitations of the aesthetics of
permanence. But things are changing too fast to allow for notions of
permanence. Planned obsolescence has ushered in the age of automatic
obsolescence- which finally means simply- we imitate in all our works
our supposition that death is final. "But the universe is alive!"
Things are hidden away, sandwiched between slices of
insignificance. Faster, faster, close, closer until All combines with
Each- and then go out for a smoke and a breath of fresh air..."But
what about Blake?" "What is freedom?" and the like.<br>
<br>
	There aren't enough things to write about (i.e. the world is
bare=T.S. Eliot's landscapes, moonscapes). More and more poems in more
and more space. Must cover more space-poems as big as California. Must
confess secrets, get attention. Must conceal embarrassments, create
embarrassments. Must mystify, satisfy, entertain, beguile, charm,
remember, enlighten, soothe, relax, inspire, challenge, attract,
impress, confuse, enrapture, mobilize. I must rebel, I must gather, I
must disseminate, I must canonize, be canonized. I must never be
literal, romanticize, hate too much or love too much, or reveal my
undesirable or questionable values. I must not be ingenuous or naive,
too intellectual or theoretical, too simplistic or bombastic, too
sententious or litigious. I must not be blank or silent, outrageously
moralistic. I must be more sexual, I must not dwell on my personal
identity, and never get too involved with feelings. I must not think
too much about my audience. I must be spontaneous. I must record
faithfully the dialogues and events of my time, like a combination
tape recorder and camera. I must be funny and use language in a witty,
inspired, telegraphic and rhythmic way. I must be aware of the group
process and not overly dwell on simplistic psychological issues in
enormous, repetitive, boring detail as frequently as possible. I must
use images, images of life and death, of youthful sexuality, of
corporate power and greed- and most of all, naked violence. I must
mention the police. I must plunder my diary writings- but disguise
them and efface them. I must divide my text into ever more digestible
sub-headings. I must copy and plagiarize. I must appropriate. I must
create ironies, within ironies, within ironies. I must reflect form. I
must create more snappy dialogue. I must be published more, write more
letters, be discussed, more, be anthologized more. I must be seen at
more fashionable parties. I must befriend the famous, woo them,
flatter them, flirt with them. I must dress befitting my artistic
accomplishments. I must be calm. I must be cool, I must conceal my
emotional nature. I must not dwell on my mistakes. I must be witty. I
must be charming. I must learn to ignore cheerfully accusations of
literary imitation or influence. I must not commit social or literary
suicide.<br>
<br>
	I must create new forms, I must create new words, I must
allude to many levels, many literatures. I must go mad. I must make
sane. I must create. I must destroy. I must make to live. I must let die.<br>
<br>
