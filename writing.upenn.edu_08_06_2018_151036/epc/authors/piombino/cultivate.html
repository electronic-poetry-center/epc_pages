It would be difficult to deny that the twentieth century has been a
period of exceptionally forceful competition among social paradigms. A
plethora of conceptions of social reality have ripened and ultimately
fallen from the contemporary tree of knowledge into a veritable
cornucopia of desperate experiments and wildly hopeful fantasies,
charismatic leaders, tragic swindles, some silly and some ghastly
utopias, and some impressive advances. Some of these advances are
already showing signs of wear and tear but have attained a degree of
historical importance. Others, such as the civil rights movement, the
women's movement, the mental health movement (to name a few) have left
in invaluable inheritance and an example of growth and change towards
healthier ways of living. Other attempts left many people with a lot
of physical and emotional baggage they don't need.<br>
<br>
Like all forms of human endeavor, poetry lives and thrives, matures
and finally fades away in importance and relevance, in part, according
to social conditions. As a result, as with other forms of essentially
individual action, there is a dynamic relationship between the social
responses to poetry and the impact of this effect on the actual
practitioner's purposes and aims. The social fact, for example, that
poetry has learned how to survive and even flourish almost in a
vacuum, as it does in the United States, amply demonstrates the
paradoxical relationship between the actual power of poetry and its
apparent social reception. As illustrated by the biographies of many
great poets, poetry can germinate and grow quite excellently in the
arid desert of practically no response whatever. Emily Dickinson and
Charles Baudelaire may serve as bright examples.<br>
<br>
There are poets who can make the rain fall in the desert. I think of
Allen Ginsberg. When he sings to hex the government, I don't hear the
music of the spheres. But when he envisions, like his soulmate Walt
Whitman, the individual's relationship to government, world, mind,
cosmos, I wonder if everyone hasn't been transformed.<br>
<br>
If we are to speak of the "social" as poets, I think it would be most
valuable to visualize it as a largely internal entity, part reality
and part fantasy, no matter what happens on television. If a poet
feels the need to address the whole society, I think it would be more
effective for her to do so as if she were talking directly to someone
else (which partly includes, of course, talking into the
void). Perhaps we ought to imagine the social as if it were a person,
and in the United States, a not very well or, at times, very coherent
person, and then, even as a kind of other person within that person,
partly unknown to the person. To me this would approximate the
"social" as it may be seen from a poet's view-point. In psychoanalysis
this is called the superego, which I have called the "supraego" to
underline those aspects of the conscience over which the individual
has little power or influence. Having, in fact, very little real power
to reshape society by force, at least for very long, the poet learns,
like any other individual, to adapt to external reality. But the
internal adaptation that takes place simultaneously is not like the
external one, and is different in some essential way from that of the
average person. The poet must learn to rebel in a certain sense
internally whether or not he or she rebels externally. Without this
small rebellion, staged within the self again and again, there would
in fact be no poem. With groups the story is different. The fact that
a very large group of people came together to protest the war in
Vietnam (and I would always think of Allen Ginsberg in this context)
did not alter much the overall and pervasive feeling of powerlessness
among individuals in our society. So what is the power of the poet
under such conditions to effect the social policy? To me the answer
lies in the fact that poetry carves out a place for the social to
exist in some freer way inside the individual human being. Denise
Levertov once said that the "language poets" take a private space on
the public beach. My response to this is that it takes a private place
within for the individual to find any comfort or freedom at all on the
public beach-which, in fact, is the only beach for most of us. Poetry
attempts to redefine the whole of experience by confronting it with
its own language, creating a self-transformative loop between language
and experience, helping to externalize what is too often internally
regarded by the individual as a public province.<br>
<br>
We live in a time when much individual experience is reduced to an
extreme version of social homogeneity. It is abundantly clear by now
to most people in the United States that if you conform in your
thoughts, you will fit in. A ready sense of humor will protect us from
any sincere reaction to a departure from the usual expressions. The
unconscious wish to suppress all idiosyncrasy is an obsessive trait
that belongs to a primitive form of tribal self-protection. In this
sense we might say that the individual has "come a long way" but the
individual as group or the group as individual is still largely
infantile-particularly when it doesn't get its own way with what it
regards as "the stubborn individual." Under such circumstances poetry
only survives in hidden forms. This means literally secret, not just
esoteric or obscure, but inscrutable. In this way it protects its
ageless loyalty to real experience, and real human needs. As long as
the extreme social hypocrisy remains, poetry will turn to extreme
means to protect itself like this, and will rediscover its power in
guarding the ancient truths. Nothing will publicize it to the
detriment of this function, no matter how energetic the
broadcasting-to whatever extent the gulf between the poet and the
public continues to be an externalization of the gulf between the
truly valued and the unquestionably phony. Such things cannot be
changed quickly or easily, because the situation has little to do with
the "social" in the reportorial sense, but more to do with the group
conception of the internal human being and the group's beliefs about
the conditions under which its importance is actually realized (which
is in a certain sense known, but unconsciously denied, for the same
reasons that so many other ideals are lost somewhere between their
social acknowledgment and their actual application). Here and now the
poet struggles to transgress not so much the external laws and norms
which are unjust but which the group continues to declare just-as
obnoxious and limiting and vicious as these can be-but the far more
insidious, cancerous, and pervasive subliminally imposed internal
ones. In this arena the powers and means of the poet often differ from
that of other people, though they partake of the universal spirit in
the individual experience, or strive to. The poet is best equipped to
intelligently transgress certain extremely important, actually crucial
internal entities, from a cultural viewpoint-crucial particularly to
the inner needs of the productive individual within the culture. The
poet's sensitivity is able to creatively transgress certain internal
boundaries in order to help define their continued existence from the
point of view of overall consciousness, and sometimes to even help
redefine them. Sometimes poetry does the latter by helping rid the
conception of the internal person of boundaries which are probably
already in a rotted condition and are ready to go. It is because of
this that poets can become "expert revolutionaries", though they
should take care not to obsessively apply their expertise in this
area, resulting from purposes that are not precisely the same as those
of full-time political revolutionaries. Suffice it to say that the
ordinary "peacetime" activities that each are generally attracted to
are not consistently the same. The poet has special skills in
creatively transgressing internal boundaries because of the wish to
make a contribution to what is out there in here.<br>
<br>
In closing I'd like to turn around that famous dictum of Gertrude
Stein: we are all a found generation.<p>
