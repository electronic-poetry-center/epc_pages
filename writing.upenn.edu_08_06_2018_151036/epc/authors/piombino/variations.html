<!-- ---------------------------- -->

The poem and the occasion of the poem are one.<br>
If this is merely an algebra of experience<br>
Than let it encompass no more than this very moment.<br>
If this is simply an equivocation of definitions <br>
Then let it embrace, in its particulars of language and gesture,<br>
Ambiguities of texture, ambivalences, repetitions, <br>
Imbalances, the inner forms of gravitational force <br>
Which are the core of what has actually occurred <br>
Within its withering, dark and palpable shapes <br>
Now appearing to turn into twisted branches <br>
As we brush past the anticipated moment of exultation<br>
In a constant effort to smile that quick greeting, <br>
Though it already seems to have been acknowledged <br>
And taken for granted, melded into another distraction, <br>
The sum totality of what can be.<br>
<br>
Thought, which has heretofore been more like a guide, <br>
Emerges as a physical milestone, solid as ice, <br>
As slippery and changing and prone to sudden cave-ins, <br>
Voluptuous as desire itself and just as dangerous.<br>
Broken rules, broken promises, broken hearts, <br>
Broken syntax, broken expectations, broken speech, <br>
And broken dreams, that stabbing icicle of a clich&eacute;<br>
So cold that no one completely knows how to be sad anymore, <br>
Only a sprinkling of notes from operatic arias, <br>
Teardrops and muffled clearing of throats, <br>
Deep breaths and sighs from the sheer momentum, <br>
Prepositions and propositions joining momentarily <br>
The chatter and questions <br>
Crisscrossing a world of mental airwaves.<p>
