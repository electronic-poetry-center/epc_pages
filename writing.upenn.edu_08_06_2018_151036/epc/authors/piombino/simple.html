The simple poetry of sleep<br>
Enclosed in the hand held absence<br>
Of narrative time<br>
Who would dare<br>
To call it a mistake<br>
If the words were not forthcoming<br>
All the evidence of life was there anyway<br>
Slightly askew diagrammatic evocation of a galaxy<br>
Something felt like it wanted to come into existence<br>
And then chose to wait and let it happen<br>
Compelled to listen for the presence of mystery<br>
What was satisfied caused to descend polyphonically<br>
Abetted by the implication of vocable sound<br>
Heard between random intervals of meaning<br>
Voices rising in chromatic insignificant phrases<br>
Against the lapping of specific waves<br>
Minute portions brush granite aural forms<br>
Density glitters between vibrant afterimages<br>
In a world of green vegetation and brown arid hills<br>
Very close to the sea<br>
The obscure aberrations of flora and fauna<br>
Astonished the oceanographers<br>
The infinite variety of evolving forms<br>
The immensely long natural tracks between wooded hills<br>
The mere suggestion of lunar ridges and shadows<br>
Added a strangely silent atmosphere to the now faded photographs<br>
Of this non-event in space and time<br>
Which existed only in its virtual state<br>
These were actual pockets of reality<br>
Embedded in a completely hypothetical situation<br>
Of which all the emblems, significations, symbols and signs<br>
Were utterly verbal in form<br>
The horizon-its mask, its secret periphery<br>
At the closest zone of its solitude<br>
Pressing its ultimate, final realization<br>
In a position contrary to its margin<br>
The poem is intrinsic to the machine<br>
The notes have a duration which corresponds<br>
To the illuminated objects bright as they are<br>
Over aeons become their signs	<br>
And when the distances contract at their maximum velocity<br>
Time is almost completely under the influence<br>
Of all those forces which are precursors to events<br>
The oldest trees and the youngest stars<br>
Have been talking a long time<br>
The unwinking hills, the apostrophes of small paths<br>
Slowly take their places on the constellations of language<br>
The commentaries spoken in computerized tongues<br>
The soft technology improvised within the logarithmic system<br>
Of substitutions and exchanges<br>
Of concepts and energy<p>
