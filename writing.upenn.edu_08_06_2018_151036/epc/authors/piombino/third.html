     To be someone you have to speak in one language. Having lived a
number of lives at once I speak only many languages. As soon as you
stop to think you think to stop. But this is not exactly how it
is. One day you catch yourself just listening. Not listening for
something, but listening. Then years go by and you've heard many
things. You've said many things, you've thought a lot, you've visited
people and places, you've wondered. You imagine that someone stops by
and you try to explain. But what comes out are words that have nothing
to do with what you had planned to say. You planned to say that the
tropic sky is definitely blue against all that yellow. And the
parakeets twitter so beguilingly that the jungle bends itself to
surround them in an orange-green veil. And that the veil is then
lifted and, after a shatter of lightning and rain, you fall asleep on
a cot on the dark, damp porch. Your dreams contain mostly ancient
images, great gods made out of stone, a woman dressed in white, an
empty plate. But what actually comes out is a long sigh, a few
complaints about who had said or done what about something or other,
and a couple of slightly more than minor disappointments. That's
all. Then you hear someone laughing - and you start to think about
dinner.</font>
