              would be an understatement to say that blogs have caught on with 
              contemporary poets. Blogs, short for "web logs," are a form of 
              online writing resembling online diaries -- entries are 
              datestamped, and often consist of the thoughts and impressions of 
              the "blogger" -- the one who writes the blog. </B></FONT></P>
              <P><FONT size=2><B><FONT 
              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This said, one can 
              see why the form has become so popular among the poets who 
              migrated into cyberspace. For the poet, blogs offer an opportunity 
              to post first drafts of poems (like Eileen Tabios does on her blog 
              <I>Gasps</I> -- <A href="http://loveslastgasps.blogspot.com/" 
              target=_blank>http://loveslastgasps.blogspot.com/</A>), comment on 
              and commend colleagues (Ron Silliman's blog -- <A 
              href="http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/" 
              target=_blank>http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/</A> -- does this, 
              as well as contextualizes much of what is going on in contemporary 
              poetics) or simply have fun with the form (Jim Behrle's <I>Famous 
              Monkey</I> at <A href="http://monkey.onepotmeal.com/" 
              target=_blank>http://monkey.onepotmeal.com/</A> pokes fun at the 
              absurdities that sometimes accompany the poet's life these days). 
              Poets have taken the blog and harnessed the web's inherent power 
              of "remediating" (Bill Marsh's term) past communication 
              technologies, writing being chief among them for language artists, 
              transforming the traditional poem into hybrid forms and contexts. 
              A blog is to a poet what Sonic Foundry's Acid Pro is to the sax 
              player.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
              <P><FONT size=2><B><FONT 
              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For New York poet 
              Nick Piombino, the blog is an extension of earlier revelations and 
              praxis. Piombino had already discovered, early on, that his 
              journal entries stood on their own as a strange sort of poetry -- 
              "theoretical objects," poet/publisher Douglas Messerli dubbed 
              them, as much of what pre-occupies Piombino is the relationship 
              among language, community, and time -- and in 1999 Green Integer 
              published Piombino's explorations of this form in a volume named 
              for Messerli's coinage. The book is lit with wry and astute 
              observations on life and art, all filtered through Piombino's 
              exquisite diction (he was, after all, a frequent contributor to 
              the original <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</I> journal of the late 70s and 
              early 80s, and his essays in <I>The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book</I> 
              should be required reading for anyone willing to examine poetry 
              and psychoanalysis side by side and intermingling: Piombino is a 
              certified psychotherapist). Consider, for example, this nugget 
              from <I>Theoretical Objects</I>:</FONT></B></FONT></P></DIV>

                face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=1>The irony of 
                the situation of contemporary poetry consists of its 
                self-concious, yet unconcious, imitations of the aesthetics of 
                permanence. But things are changing too fast to allow for 
                notions of permanence. Planned obsolescence has ushered in the 
                age of automatic obsolescence -- which finally means simply -- 
                we imitate in all our works our supposition that death is final. 
                'But the universe is alive!' Things are hidden away, sandwhiched 
                between slices of insignificance. Faster, faster, closer, closer 
                until All combines with Each -- and then go out for a smoke and

              href="http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/" 
              target=_blank>http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/</A>) on February 
              11, 2003. The September 11 tragedies of 2001 may have pushed 
              Piombino finally toward blogging, at least toward the communities 
              that have sprung up around blogging.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
              <P><FONT size=2><B><FONT 
              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Poet and web artist 
              Bill Marsh has said of <I>fait accompli</I> that "...at heart, in 
              the middle, underneath (the space of remediation is difficult to 
              manage), the steady return to moments of <I>writing through</I> 
              now <I>written into</I> the domain of Fait Accompli. Offered up as 
              a done deal, the site is nonetheless always recreating itself, 
              dealing again, perhaps just in time to figure things out...." 
              Bill's referring here to Piombino's habit of offering up older 
              poems -- work dating back through the 60s -- on the blog. Nick is 
              adverse to working in a chronological vein -- the objects in 
              <I>Theoretical Objects</I> span the 70s and 90s, and appear in an 
              order best suited for their style and content, as opposed to a 
              strict chronology. This, for me, is one of the most fascinating 
              aspects of the blog as well -- the older poems somehow highlight 
              current strands of thought, as if progress itself were an 
              illusion. As such, its an anti-hierachical approach: or, more 
              precisely, a "poly-hierarchical" approach, in that Nick is 
              obviously viewing the work not as the "master narrative" that 
              peers from every object modernism has left us, but as 
              transparencies, past ideas lying over present thoughts, tracing 
              kinship patterns, sure, but also allowing new shapes to emerge. 
              It's a very zenist approach to composition, and also an approach 
              that lies at the heart of the best of contemporary 
              work.</FONT></B></FONT></P>

              can make art by simply casting a glance. A set of glances could be 
              as solid as any thing or place, but the society continues to cheat 
              the artist out of his 'art of looking' by only valuing 'art 
              objects.' The existence of the artist in time is worth as much as 
              the finished product. Any critic who devalues the <I>time</I> of 
              the artist is the enemy of art and the artist. The stronger and 
              clearer the artist's <I>view</I> of time the more he will resent 
              any slander on this domain. By desecrating this domain, certain 
              critics defraud the work and mind of the artist. Artists with a 
              weak view of time are easily deceived by this victimizing kind of 
              criticism, and are seduced into some trivial history. An artist is 
              enslaved by time only if the time is controlled by someone or 
              something other than himself. The deeper the artist sinks into the 
              time stream the more it becomes <I>oblivion</I>; because of this, 
              he must remain close to the temporal surfaces. Many would like to 
              forget time altogether, because it conceals the "death principle" 
              (every authentic artist knows this). Floating in this temporal 
              river are the remnants of art history, yet the "present" cannot 
              support the cultures of Europe, or even the archaic or primitive 
              civilizations; it must instead explore the pre-and post-historic 
              mind; it must go into the places where remote futures meet remote 
              pasts."</FONT></FONT></B></FONT></P>

              color=#000099>I’ve found Robert Smithson far more inspiring to 
              read than Jacques Lacan, who has always struck me as the ultimate 
              pretentious intellectual. Lacan’s writing is composed mainly of 
              terminology, which possibly was outdated by the time his writing 
              appeared in English, maybe by the time it appeared in French, I 
              don’t know, and terminology is a trap, at best, though I indulge 
              in it like any other writer, and any other psychoanalyst. Ever 
              since Freud published his work, many other psychoanalytic 
              theorists have tried to create new architectures while sustaining 
              the old foundation. The best of these were D.W. Winnicott’s and 
              Heinz Kohut’s. As a poet and as a psychoanalyst I’ve found very 
              little of value in Lacan. But maybe you just had to be there to 
              "get the joke." I have a hunch that Lacan, who obviously loved 
              classical psychoanalysis, and seeing that it was already pretty 
              much outdated by the time he arrived on the scene, made a heroic 
              attempt to bring Freud into the present. All these efforts are 
              doomed to fail and also unnecessary. Freud’s ideas, as far as they 
              were successful, and they were very successful, are already 
              completely absorbed into the culture. Lacan may have done more 
              harm than good to psychoanalysis by making it appear more arcane 
              than it actually is in practice, if not in its theoretical 
              manifestations. Much better to read Freud and forget Lacan, in my 
              opinion. Maybe best to start with <I>The Psychopathology of 
              Everyday Life</I>, though, not <I>The Interpretation of 
              Dreams</I>.</FONT></FONT></B></FONT></P>

              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If "object of 
              desire"means what am I after in my writing, what do I want from 
              it, this has changed and evolved over the 40 years I have been 
              writing. Early on I was strongly influenced by two cultural 
              movements: psychoanalysis and abstract expressionism. Not long 
              after, in the middle to late 60’s, when I read the work of Ted 
              Berrigan, Vito Acconci, Bernadette Mayer and Jackson Mac Low I 
              found a literary home in the ideas of conceptual art, and this 
              very much included Smithson. I met Smithson only once, we had 
              lunch at Max’s Kansas City, where I was introduced to him by Wayne 
              Timm, an artist I knew who was tending bar there at the time. 
              Smithson expressed his interest in poetry, chided his friend who 
              had joined us who had not been writing any poetry lately. I never 
              saw Smithson again because soon after he was killed in a plane 
              crash in the process of photographing one of his Earthworks. I 
              took a workshop with Ted Berrigan in 1967 who became a friend and 
              helped me to get some early work published. I took a workshop in 
              1972 with Bernadette Mayer, many of whose ideas about writing more 
              or less took permanent root in me from that time on, and whose 
              work and teaching was a great inspiration. I met Jackson Mac Low 
              in 1967 at an anti-war demonstration and was introduced to him by 
              Allen Ginsberg who I had met in the early 60’s. I took a class 
              with William Burroughs at the City College of New York in 1965, 
              whose work and ideas were also an early influence and 
              inspiration.</FONT></B></FONT></P>

              this and found his methods very inspiring, I did not adapt them 
              for my own. Mayer’s ideas about journal writing allowed me to be 
              both personal and conceptual in my writing, both introspective and 
              theoretical. Many, if not most, contemporary innovative poetic 
              forms, mostly inspired by Ted Berrigan and John Ashbery, call for 
              conversationally-oriented charm, wit and humor, which I enjoy 
              immensely, but are not central concerns in my own 
              work.</FONT></B></FONT></P>

              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the advantages 
              of journal writing over conventional poetic practice is the 
              opportunity to think through experiences concerning other people, 
              an interest obviously deepened by the practice of psychoanalysis. 
              After working with people every day for so many years my work 
              began to be consciously based on an assumption that the reader 
              ought to be a co-participant in the creation of the poem. I see my 
              writing practice as mainly concerned with interaction, that is 
              producing interaction as opposed to discussing interaction or 
              assuming interaction or even manifesting interaction: but not 
              necessarily only conscious interaction or even rational 
              interaction. Some of the most productive moments between people 
              are not necessarily clear or even articulated, brought to the 
              surface or revealed; nevertheless, such experiences may be 
              important, crucial or even decisive. This can lead, sometimes, to 
              people not getting proper credit when they deserve it. When I 
              wrote "Explications," I felt exhilarated and it was one of the 
              most freeing experiences of my writing life because it theorized 
              the existence of the poem in the mind of the reader, and not 
              anywhere else.</FONT></B></FONT></P>

              9/11, like so many others, I felt a desperate need to connect with 
              a literary community. Charles Bernstein’s SUNY/Buffalo poetics 
              listserv was at hand and I began to exchange ideas with other 
              poets almost every day. This was very productive and helped me to 
              move beyond the resulting fear and chaos. It led to a dialogue 
              with Barrett Watten which was later published by Barrett on a

              literary form that has ever existed. It doesn’t have to be so in a 
              plodding, literal way, like composing "collaborations," which can 
              be interesting and worthwhile, but blogging can also be 
              collaborative in a more spontaneous and subliminal way, for 
              example through html linking. What I want from literary practice 
              is for poets to have a more productive exchange, to give and get 
              more credit and enjoy doing the work and sharing the process much,

              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just realized that 
              what you are getting at about objects also has to do with the idea 
              of the materiality of the "book" and how that connects with 
              materialism. I have always been troubled by the materialistic 
              aspect of culture and the whole book culture, and the culture of 
              competition and the frequently artificial creation of reputations 
              is part of all of this. This is particularly a problem with males. 
              Males are fiercely competitive and poets are not exempt from the 
              desire to be "top dog." Many, if not all, male poets, and more 
              than a few female poets, indulge in putting down other poets, and 
              comparing poets. Much energy is wasted in trying to reveal the 
              best and the best of the best. This can be seen in the desire to 
              be the one who has the most books in print, be the one most 
              frequently mentioned, be asked most frequently to give readings, 
              be most frequently anthologized, etc. This is equated with success 
              in our culture and is sadly the basis of self-esteem. It is very 
              hard to resist this because there are so few rewards of any kind 
              for doing innovative writing. This might also partly explain the 
              occasional suicidal tendency in older poets when their fame gives 
              way to the successes of younger poets. To get beyond this means to 
              get beyond hierarchical thinking. I think this is at the heart of 
              what motivates many of my poetic theories. Maybe part of the idea 
              of discovering who is best is to try to undermine the way 
              reputations are falsely created. But this will never work. What 
              has to happen for all this to change is for writers to be 
              positioned to acknowledge the importance of other people in their 
              lives, all the other people, not just the kingpin people, and not 
              just other artists and poets, alive or dead, known or little 
              known; I am interested in this sort of acknowledgement being an 
              important aspect of the process of my writing. Every aspect of 
              living is collaborative; therefore, every aspect of thinking and 
              saying is collaborative and it not enough just to say this and 
              acknowledge it. We must go further.</FONT></B></FONT></P>

              are invariably a few who take it on themselves to dismiss certain 
              other poets as not worthy of recognition or admiration. And there 
              are others, who struggle to bring recognition to as many poets 
              that they like as possible. There is one poet who I know who is 
              nearly always intentionally nasty to any new poet acquaintance of 
              mine who he would see me talking to at a reading or event. It took 
              me literally years to figure out that this was his way of keeping 
              control of the social grouping. If all the poets in the circle 
              were friends or fans of his, he could try to keep absolute control 
              of the opinions of the group. He has been doing this for over 25 
              years. Another technique of his was to come to every reading of 
              mine and praise my work highly to my face. However, he has never 
              once in a quarter of a century mentioned my name in print or in 
              any interview, or quoted my work, or complimented my work at all 
              in any way that could be documented, although he has had countless 
              opportunities. Famously, Andre Breton would dismiss certain poets 
              from the surrealist circle if he felt they were no longer 
              deserving of participation, according to his whims. The other day 
              I had a warm conversation with a poet who professed much love for 
              me, and my work, but he immediately dismissed any attempt on my 
              part to mention blogging or bloggers. After awhile, when people 
              have no questions at all to ask me about what I am doing, or my 
              work, they can tell me how much they love me or my work all they 
              want, I know they are not being honest. They just want to get 
              along and count on my "vote" and I guess that is fine, sort of. 
              When a person is really interested in someone, they never lose 
              their curiosity about what they are doing. They want to know more

              a reputation is a complex thing, but in many ways it has a great 
              kinship with advertising and politics. Advertisers compete for 
              claims of quality, so do groups of poets, so do magazines, 
              critics, academic departments, and others who set themselves up or 
              are set up as experts. Blogging, as it has evolved in the circle 
              of bloggers I am a part of, does not work this way. It is more 
              like the "wild west." Bloggers stake their "claims" in the mostly 
              free zone of weblogging, just as miners went out west and filed 
              for a claim. Response comes or it doesn't. Who is to say what is

              writers were acclaimed during their lives but were forgotten 
              immediately after their deaths. The reason? Often their fame 
              depended more on their editing and anthologizing and politicking 
              and less on any actual interest in their writing. There is no

              somebody likes, for whatever reason. It is a kind of advertising 
              and that's what people have to do in our culture to draw attention 
              to something or someone, and has no intrinsic legitimacy over any 
              other publicizing that anyone else is doing. But when this is 
              done, of course, others feel excluded and ask "Why not me? My work 
              is far more interesting. Or, why not so and so. She deserves more 
              attention than she is getting." There is something essentially 
              unfair about the way opportunities emerge that will never be 
              totally eradicated. But at least with blogging it has little or 
              nothing to do with money, fame, or social advantage. Each blogger 
              stands on their own. I like the dailiness of blogging, and this 
              tends to downplay the portentous "arrival" of a book or an issue 
              of a magazine. 99.999% of what is published is forgotten in the 
              long run no matter what anybody does, consensus or no consensus, 
              critics or no critics. That's just the way it is. Only time 
              determines intrinsic quality in writing and art and nothing 
              else.</FONT></B></FONT><FONT size=2><B></B></FONT></P>

              color=#000099>When I refer to blogging's dailiness I am not 
              thinking only of its diaristic qualities. Ordinary diaries are 
              private. If a psychoanalyst were to recommend journaling (by the 
              way, this is far from a standard recommendation) it would probably 
              be for the patient to have the opportunity to practice free 
              association. Everyday conversation is anything but free 
              associative, though without any aspect of free association 
              conversations are awfully unimaginative and tedious. When people 
              completely free associate in everyday life it is received in one 
              of two ways: as humor or as craziness. I have this hunch that the 
              success of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy arose with the 
              complete success of competition as a way of life, along with the 
              demise of religion among intellectuals. Today it is most uncool, 
              particularly for a male, to talk freely under any circumstances. 
              Expressiveness would involve openness about feelings and this is 
              all but impossible under severely competitive conditions. This is 
              why talking privately with nearly any male (for another male) is 
              usually so boring. "Everything is fine, just fine." Then there is 
              talking about the sports you both know, the news you both know, 
              with all the opinions you both know, the gossip you both know, the 
              books you both know, the movies and tv shows with all opinions 
              about them you both already knnow, the shop talk you both know, 
              "Yeah I feel great, terrific, things are going great, I just got a 
              raise (a new book, article, award, won a tournament, got a part in 
              a play, etc., etc.)." Thus the complete success of psychotherapy. 
              Anonymous sharing of feelings with a trusted professional so you 
              can get back in there are say "Great, fine, terrific" with all 
              your "close" friends.</FONT></FONT></B></FONT></P>

              when people say to me so proudly: "Oh, I would NEVER put my diary

              myself of regrets and this effort, so far, knock on wood, has been 
              quite successful. I have always been fascinated by time and doing 
              <I>fait accompli</I> has taught me that the past is a fiction in 
              the sense that once events are past, we have to try to understand 
              that when we replay them in our minds the word "happen" no longer 
              applies. While things in the past have occurred, when we replay 
              them in our minds we have a sense of ongoingness. This is an 
              illusion. Even though the results live on, and sometimes the 
              feelings, since we cannot change these events the only action we 
              can take is understanding. This is the whole point behind Freud's

              writers. On blogs poetic work is seen for what it truly is: 
              provisional. I had always loved the finality of books. I am quite 
              sure I loved books so much because my father was such a closed and 
              secretive man. Authors were all the wise fathers and mothers who 
              would share their inner feelings, thoughts and memories with me, 
              something my father was unable to do. But I had to imagine all the 
              interactions with them in my own mind based on the dialogues, in 
              the case of the novel, and the reactions of other writers to their 
              ideas in the case of non-fiction. I was after the wise words my 
              father did not offer me. I went to psychoanalysis for a long time 
              for the same reason. Eventually I learned that, as the poet James 
              Schuyler put it: "The past is past/ I salute that various field." 
              But I don't only salute it. The trick I learned was to convert 
              feelings about the past into knowledge I can apply to the present

              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have pretty much 
              lost interest in a certain idea of writing -- whether poetry or 
              fiction -- that presents itself as a permanent object to be reread 
              -- like a piece of sculpture or a painting in a museum. I like the 
              idea of writing that presents itself as an image of thought and 
              interaction in the here and now -- but not in a literal way -- in 
              a way that includes the unconscious and precognitive dimensions. 
              Douglas Messerli gave me the phrase "theoretical objects" to 
              describe the writing I had been doing in my journals. I loved it 
              because I was trying to theorize about what I could do with 
              writing that would more closely meet my needs. The poet Elizabeth 
              Fodaski started a magazine called <I>Torque</I> and was the first 
              editor to specifically ask me for pieces like this for her 
              magazine. I edited "Theoretical Objects" (Green Integer, 1999) 
              with the help of Toni Simon. She loved my "automatic manifestoes" 
              which where free associative theoretical objects. I had complained 
              to her countless times about many aspects of being a poet. Once 
              she said: "So why don't you write about that?" In putting together 
              "Theoretical Objects" I went to my journal entries and published 
              writings, and chose mostly works which explored such issues having 
              to do with the process of writing and the life of the writer. Many 
              of these pieces were diary-like. I began to realize that most 
              contemporary poetry, probably all modern writing, was an excuse to 
              express one's feelings, under cover of serious literary intent. 
              Thus an opportunity for expressing and communicating one's 
              feelings and experiences could now be subsumed under the 
              universally acceptable and obsessive competitive drive for 
              achievement and personal power and 
              recognition.</FONT></B></FONT></P>

              kind of writing. Interaction is considered ephemeral while 
              speeches and monologues are considered permanent. This is because 
              interaction involves another person and how can you copyright 
              this? Under cover of art "movements" the collaborative nature of 
              all art can be manifested. But the typical artist uses a 
              "movement" mostly to launch their own work and then goes on their 
              own way to seek "fame and fortune,"make a name for themselves. It 
              is a sad fact of contemporary life that self-esteem must be based 
              on the achievement of personal recognition and making a "name" for 
              oneself. There is little choice about this. This is the way the 
              human mind functions. But that doesn't mean this is desirable or 
              even healthy. To opt out of this means mostly to be left out and

              paradigm of a new discovery outdating all other discoveries when 
              applied to the arts leads to a cul-de-sac. The arts need a 
              different concept of time which is cyclical. Contemporary art and 
              writing seek the timeless by means of "originality." "Originality" 
              is a way of restoring a false, useless and manipulative concept of 
              personal power and dominance. This is how so-called "critics" make 
              a name for themselves and a living, by choosing themselves as 
              experts who will determine what are the original minds. Poetry is 
              not "news that stays news." Poetry is an anachronism because it is 
              based on a false concept of original ideas. Creativity is 
              collaborative in its essence. All art and poetry is an ensemble. 
              Blogging is a form of writing that may have some possibility of 
              temporarily transcending some of these false paradigms. By 
              publishing one's work on a daily or nearly daily basis, poetry can 
              reveal more of its process oriented and interactive components. 
              Just as the internet brought more speed and simultaneity into the 
              scientific community, blogging is capable of bringing many more 
              communicative and social aspects into the writing community. 
              However, as in all attempts to bring community into artistic life, 
              it will be countered by the drive for commercial applications and

              thinking of the hopes and expectations that go into the 
              publication of a book. I think poets think of books like Whitman’s 
              <I>Leaves of Grass</I> or collections of Emily Dickenson, Rilke’s 
              <I>Duino Elegies</I>, Baudelaire’s <I>Les Fleurs du Mal</I> etc., 
              even Olson’s "Maximus" poems and so on, that emerged in a 
              different era of poetry publication. These books in turn echoed 
              countless earlier milestones, Shakespeare’s <I>Sonnets</I>, etc. 
              Nada Gordon’s recent echoes of Whitman, for me, bring home the 
              necessarily ambivalent feelings of a writer in the post-modern era 
              in regard to the classics. There is Adorno’s oft-repeated comment 
              about the impossibility of poetry after Auschwitz. He was 
              thinking, of course, of the classics. But he was also thinking of 
              what might happen to people emotionally, people like Celan, who 
              directly experienced the results of these events and who dwelt too 
              much inside their emotions the way poets used to and thought too 
              much about these things. There is an important relationship 
              between emotional survival and forgetting. We don’t desire 
              cultural "forgetting"and this brings us into the role of the poet 
              in contemporary life. This role has everything to do with history 
              and how it is to be interpreted in contemporary life.

              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Book culture has a 
              very different relationship to time than blog culture. I am 
              fascinated by the fact that I feel impelled to blog every day, 
              much the way a diarist might feel impelled to write something in 
              their diary every day. I have a group of readers and this group 
              changes over time, of course. I was saying to you earlier on the 
              telephone today that when I was a child I wanted to be a pianist. 
              Since my parents traveled they insisted on my taking up the 
              accordion, but this may have had to do also with my father’s 
              Italian background. I never liked the instrument because I was 
              interested in playing Chopin. Now when I blog from my notebooks I 
              like to imagine that I am playing a musical instrument from my 
              notes. As I write in response to you now, I am writing from notes 
              but also ignoring them, in a kind of improvisational way, but then 
              I am going back to them and consulting them. I like the way 
              diaries and blogs dwell on the details and specifics of everyday 
              life. This creates a flow that is more akin to everyday life than 
              fiction, for me. On blogs, for instance, poems are particular 
              events, not part of a collection. I like to see the way poems jump 
              out at you in a surprising way on a blog, when you least expect 
              it. Collections of poetry, by definition, lack this sense of 
              surprise. Even worse, poets feel compelled to make all the works 
              look the same, as if this were a virtue. I find that boring, so I 
              like to try out all kinds of different forms and vary them in my 
              collections of writings. </FONT></B></FONT></P>

              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bloggers, when they 
              post daily, or frequently, are not necessarily constructing a 
              collection of works to publish, though I do hope to publish my 
              journal writings on <I>fait accompli</I>. This book would not be 
              unlike my book <I>Theoretical Objects</I>. But with <I>Theoretical 
              Objects</I> I felt uncomfortable with being too obvious about the 
              fact that I was somewhat jumping around chronologically in putting 
              together the collection. I was "time traveling" but I didn’t know 
              it yet. In the collections I am now putting together I will 
              include the dates, but I probably will also have an introduction 
              to explain what I have been trying to do in <I>fait accompli</I>. 
              I didn’t do this on the blog because I have been proceeding 
              intuitively. </FONT></B></FONT></P>

              face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I became interested 
              in literary diaries when I realized that that they had many of the 
              features of fiction that I liked, but I also liked the sense of 
              experiencing the daily life of the writer in raw form, less 
              edited. Real life doesn’t flow like a conventional narrative, 
              which has to supply a point and some suspense. I like to focus on 
              the writer’s philosophical musings, but the literary journal also 
              allows for much more insight into the writer’s everyday conflicts, 
              ambivalences, doubts, anxieties. In fiction, whether you are 
              looking at a hero, or anti-hero, the writer feels she or he has to 
              satisfy the critics and be amusing and interesting and find a way 
              to deliberately hold your attention. I prefer it if the writer 
              actually takes a risk to be boring in the conventional meaning of 
              the term -- that is, telling you their actual feelings, their 
              confusions, their superstitions, their secret hopes and 
              expectations. I am interested when writers violate the everyday 
              boundary between private and public, but not in the usual way, 
              that is, to be "shocking." In novels, the writer has to be 
              "interesting." I often get very bored when people feel they have 
              to be "interesting." People always wonder if I get bored listening 
              to patients. The fact is, when you care about someone you never 
              get bored. People get bored when they forget how to care, and then 
              they need all kinds of stimulants just to get through everyday 
              life. Then they get bored with the stimulants because they are no 
              longer surprised by their reactions. Caring is the great 
              stimulant. You do become vulnerable when you care -- but maybe it 
              is more interesting to feel hurt than to feel 
              isolated.</FONT></B></FONT> </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
