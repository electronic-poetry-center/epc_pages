          Reading Andrew Levy, one proceeds improvisationally. I want to suggest 
          that the unit of improvisation is the fragment (linguistic and conceptual), 
          and that this fragment, however comfortable it may be in a twenty-first-century 
          avant-garde, is also the fruit of long tradition. Moreover, I take Levy's 
          work to be engaged in a discourse <i>of</i> the fragment, in a life-story 
          of variation, the fragment-variant being what Levy himself might call 
          (after John Dewey) &quot;an indispensable coefficient of esthetic order.&quot;<font color="#003366"><b><font size="-2">1</font></b></font><br>
          <br>
          These notes, in their own admitted partiality, are about what that discourse 
          is, is not, or might be.</font></p>

          Some say that until the end of democracy, liberalism, and industrialization, 
          &quot;newness&quot; in art is unlikely to be very surprising. Following 
          Levy himself, then, it seems fair to return to Romanticism to begin 
          thinking about fragments.<font color="#003366"><b><font size="-2">2</font></b></font> 
          I have a particular interest in the philosophical fragments of Novalis 
          and Friedrich and A. W. Schlegel published in the <i>Athenaeum</i> from 
          1798-1800, but ideas about fragments were ubiquitous in Romantic thought 
          in both poetry and prose from that time on, in at least three languages. 
          In their fragments, the German Romantics were themselves preceded logically 
          by Pascal, Montaigne, and the English and French moralists. What the 
          German writers took for their own from these earlier writers was &quot;the 
          relative incompletion (the 'essay') or absence of discursive development 
          (the 'thought') of each of its pieces; the variety and mixture of objects 
          that a single ensemble of pieces can treat; [and] the unity of the ensemble, 
          &#133; , constituted in a certain way outside the work, in the subject 
          that is seen in it, or in the judgment that proffers its maxims in it.&quot;<font color="#003366"><b><font size="-2">3</font></b></font> 
          In other words, the philosophical fragments were marked by conditions 
          shared by the body of poetry I'm about to discuss-condensation, internal 
          eclecticism, and a conception of the whole derived from outside the 
          work. <br>
          <br>
          Although my starting point, the <i>Athenaeum</i> fragment, is not a 
          work of poetry (and, arguably, not even a unified &quot;work&quot;), 
          one might say that its method proved foundational for much investigative 
          and philosophically oriented art-including poetry-that followed.<font color="#003366"><b><font size="-2">4</font></b></font> 
          And, to the extent that Romantic ideas are still being worked out in 
          the arts of the present, these thoughts may apply broadly to contemporary 
          practices. Since Levy deals thematically, methodologically, and critically 
          with the part and meaningfulness of partiality and continuity, it seems 
          to me useful to show how the legacy of Romanticism's fragment plays 
          out in specific instances of his work.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In these lines 
          from &quot;Evocation&quot; Levy points to a &quot;making&quot; or mechanism 
          of life by referring from inside experience (&quot;live this <i>thing</i>&quot;-a 
          life being a phenomenologically discrete and therefore in some sense 
          discontinuous concept) to a gravitational or spatial &quot;outside&quot; 
          of language (&quot;centrifugal a circuit of / grammar&quot;). He's concerned 
          with the break both made and overcome by language and sight. This sense 
          of fracture as more than wreckage, as something <i>made</i>, is meaningful 
          in and at its own limit.<font color="#003366"><b><font size="-2">6</font></b></font> 
          The &quot;push&quot; at the limit (the eyeball, body, language, life 
          &#133; ) is toward &quot;becoming,&quot; but it's also invested in its 
          (&quot;untried&quot;) incompletion or breaking off, where the break 
          becomes a potentiality. In Romantic terms, the movement from fracture 
          to meaning can be characterized as &quot;individuation&quot;: <br>

        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &quot;One is 
            tempted to say that the essence of the fragment is individuation. 
            As an indicator of a process rather than of a fixed state, this term 
            is in agreement with the important <i>Athenaeum</i> fragment 116, 
            where the 'particular essence' of romantic poetry is 'that it should 
            forever be becoming and never be perfected.'&quot;<font color="#003366"><b><font size="-2">7</font></b></font></font></p>

          defining itself as making, moves through and inhabits its syntactic 
          gaps both compositionally and semantically. That is, the grammatical 
          gap is empty (&quot;an abyss&quot;) in some sense, but also &quot;swarming&quot; 
          with meaning. The gap negotiated by the writer-reader in getting from 
          A to B isn't a rarefied self-circular void, though, but a neutral, even 
          quotidian, potentiality-a domain of possible action for a political 
          and studiously <i>written</i> subject:</font></p>

          to absorption; it thematizes the partial (or partially absent) discourse, 
          the relationship of part to whole, as a frontier. Beyond the frontier 
          is where &quot;you are not&quot;--until language, with its &quot;shards 
          of assembled residence&quot; comes around again to the next line.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;And you were born in what lies outside yourself,&quot; Levy says, 
          placing &quot;you&quot; in the middle of its own run-on &quot;social 
          life,&quot; where the negotiation of part to whole &quot;piss[es] off

          to the unity of the whole in this poem points to a kind of transcendentalism 
          derived from just such an abstract ideal. In an essay published in <i>Writing 
          from the New Coast: Technique</i>, Levy's &quot;unequated remnant&quot; 
          of the original poem becomes &quot;unrequited&quot;; the reference turns 
          into a desire. He continues the essay with a confession of belief in 
          a kind of sacred authenticity and mystery: the whole to which the part 
          refers:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am a religious 
            thinker who believes in an originary world outside mankind's linguistic 
            representations. It is unknowable, and I do not find that terrifying. 
            Trusting prose so quickly leads one into a questioning of beliefs. 
            Trusting it enough to complete a sentence. There are no separations 
            in our bodies. There are separations in everything else and our use 
            and understanding of language has helped us place them there.<font color="#003366"><b><font size="-2">21</font></b></font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here Levy seems 
          to aver his belief, then to distance himself from it, taking up an ever 
          more contingent position in relation to his own assertion, even in relation 
          to sentences themselves. Unable to finish his sentence, he's left with 
          &quot;bodies and separations&quot;-which is what the real (as opposed 
          to &quot;originary&quot;) world is full of. Contingent and negatively 
          capable bodies (people) enact the nervous interplay between whole and 
          part, continuity and discontinuity, collectivity and individuality, 
          toward which Levy continually nods. &quot; &#133; Like the / end-there's 
          another sentence to be written. Another thought to / form, surrounded

          here is apt. Levinson, in <i>The Romantic Fragment Poem</i>, 210-211, 
          expands on Keats's &quot;being in uncertainties&quot; as it relates 
          to fragment: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In 
            foregrounding its want of finish, the [Romantic Fragment Poem] not 
            only proclaims its failure to achieve both its formal end and the 
            author's practical objectives, it presents these failures as a triumph. 
            The reversal hinges on the poet's ability to persuade his readers 
            that the fragment's irresolution signifies the rejection of a mean, 
            mechanical success-the sort produced, for example, by &quot;consequitive 
            reasoning&quot; or a vulgar means-end rationality. Applied to literary 
            production, Keats's phrase describes a poetry that originates in the 
            author's determination to realize an objective and that terminates 
            with that realization. Although Keats proposes the &quot;rat trap&quot; 
            as a metaphor for epistolary design, his poetry and his remarks about 
            poetry define an opposite virtue: doctrinal, rhetorical, and affective 
            contingency.</font></p>
