      writing, I thought I'd ask you how you negotiate the intersection without
      resorting to testimonials.&nbsp; Is it even a matter of &quot;how&quot; or
      is it simply a matter of &quot;negotiate&quot; (as if there were space /
      time to strategize in all cases)?&nbsp; Since the logic of intersection is
      so counter-intuitive anyhow, I thought your immanently counter-intuitive
      opener from &quot;An Indispensable Coefficient of Esthetic Order&quot;

      Levy:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think that all of
      life and writing is living -- I don't know that it's a matter of one or
      the other, that&nbsp;writing and life necessarily are or need to be
      thought of as &quot;in&quot; the other. I don't experience writing and
      reading and living as proposing an intersection so much as a layering. And
      the layering can contain/obtain testimonials if one would like, as well as
      questions of &quot;how&quot; or matters of &quot;negotiation&quot;. But
      even if it, i.e., living and writing are experiential objects and subjects
      to always be negotiated I don't think it's&nbsp; &quot;simply a matter
      of&quot; as to negotiate&nbsp;suggests to me&nbsp;an extremely complex set
      of emotions.&nbsp;There is never time and oftentimes little need to
      &quot;strategize.&quot; Little to be gained. To do so would strike me as
      counter-intuitive in deed.&nbsp;Within my experience of writing to find
      out what the writing, what poetry can and might be it has been something,
      one can call it&nbsp;intuition if one likes, that opens time up so that I
      can&nbsp;see and make choices as to what has felt in the act of writing to
      hold the most promise, to be the most fruitful, generative, gifted. I've
      never felt that I could take credit for the &quot;intuitions&quot; that&nbsp;in
      reading outside the immediate act of writing (if that sense of time and
      place ever actually exists for a writer) I've later felt successful. Even
      if later I've found the results&nbsp;a failure.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;color:black"><o:p>

      the opener to the essay &quot;An Indispensable Coefficient of Esthetic
      Order&quot; appears counter-intuitive, I hadn't thought at the time of
      writing that sentence that it was meant to represent a particular tact, or
      tendency on my part. The sentence was an opener, to get me thinking about
      what that same sentence could possibly mean. I don't believe the
      &quot;logic&quot;&nbsp;to my poetry is one of intersection. A poem may
      contain moments of thought that are counter-intuitive,&nbsp;analytical,&nbsp;narrative.&nbsp;These
      things&nbsp;complement the lyric, for example,&nbsp;in a variety of
      interesting ways. I've wanted to make poetry that changes while one reads
      it,&nbsp;something that might contain, reflect, let go a multitude of
      subjectivities,&nbsp;experiences of various&nbsp;kinds (a varietal
      identity) finding relations between themselves in a constellation or
      assemblage I'm simply as writer&nbsp;a witness to, a conscience. I think
      there is great continuity of a new kind in and between the one-liners, as
      Fanny Howe suggested in her cover blurb, of <i>Paper Head Last Lyrics</i>.

      do we <i>use</i> reading and when / where writing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I think of the epigraph from Martin Buber (“All real living is
      meeting.”) to the “Songs &amp; Improvisations” series in <i>Continuous
      Discontinuous</i> as another (at least strange, if not “counter”)
      paradox of – shifting attention between “real” (ideation) and
      “meeting” (materialization) – as another possibly “new”

font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black">AL:
      An &quot;economy of attention&quot; reminds me of a few lines from <i>Democracy
      Assemblages</i>: &quot;wisdom / to measure / in the smallest of / shelters
      / the familiarity of our attention&quot; I remember many years ago Allen
      Ginsberg telling me that he liked those lines. At that time in my life I
      didn't have much discipline when it came to anything. When I think about
      my own writing and look around at the world outside my desk I wonder
      exactly what kind of discipline can help me or anyone else to survive. I'd
      say that witnessing, being a conscience and so being conscious about one's
      ability to attend, to maintain the endurance of the one who apprehends, is
      the only discipline worth striving for. <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">What
      I meant by poetry &quot;free of disciplinary thinking&quot; was not poetry
      free of discipline per se, but of hierarchical categorization and
      over-specialization, i.e., the economics and divisions of academic
      disciplines.</span> I prefer that work and those people who think and work
      outside traditional disciplinary models. Regarding the bugbear, I'm not
      sure that I know what you're thinking by the word &quot;use,&quot; when do
      we use reading and when/where writing? And I don't know who &quot;we&quot;
      is or would include or exclude in this instance either. I 'use' reading
      for help in creating meaning, and I think I use writing for something
      similar. A friend, Christine Meilicke wrote me recently following a <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">lunchtime</span>
      conversation we'd had and sent the following in response to a question I'd
      raised about what is needed to create meaning. She wrote -- &quot;Creation
      of meaning: patience / concentration / intensity / belief.&quot; I think
      that through reading and writing one &quot;positions&quot; oneself, even
      if it is only momentarily. It's an art of listening. Buber's &quot;All
      real living is meeting&quot; is what reading and writing can be, an
      intuition / apprehension that brings with it the most joy. <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">I
      don't know that shifting attention from one thing to another has ever been
      that enjoyable</span>, at least for me. I feel that ideation and
      materialization are getting married. <o:p>

      problem we have is &quot;finding a vocabulary stable enough to set us
      going...&quot; The negotiations we've been speaking of are the language
      that&nbsp;is to be found in poetry -- the language of our
      &quot;interview&quot; may be something else. Perhaps it can never be&nbsp;as
      dynamic. Or,&nbsp;let's just leave it that it's different from what poetry
      can do--layering and intersecting, keeping the vocabulary unstable enough
      to keep it alive, difficult to handle,&nbsp;and very interesting.&nbsp;You
      say a poetry that's written as it's read. That's the dynamic one would
      wish to experience and affect. At the same time, I would never wish a
      reader&nbsp;to feel like they were being given a homework assignment, or
      that the reader had to make the meaning for him/herself.&nbsp;Though I've
      set out upon a rather &quot;unstable&quot; imaginary quest,&nbsp;I have
      written the poetry&nbsp;published under my name.&nbsp;As friend Robert
      Kocik put it some years back: &quot;Participatory reading as writing
      practice standing in for nonpassive living assumes there are cases wherein
      readers don't think for themselves, and kids who? ... When people come
      home from work, they should be invited to complete your work for
      themselves as well.&quot; If I feel that way about a book I put it down.
      And I agree with you, it's not an additive process.</span><span style="font-size:

      from similarly modest middle-class / working class&nbsp;families we appear
      to be similarly attracted to the idea of a poetry&nbsp;beyond the liberal
      marketplace. We're both the first children in our respective families to
      make it to and through the university. Make it through to what exactly is
      the question I've asked myself these last half-dozen years or so. That
      question has reformulated itself from one that was originally fueled in
      part by disappointment with what I'd earlier and naively perceived to be a
      radical place of ideas and performances/actions, to a question about what
      I truly believe in and the viable alternative spaces in which to create
      and examine the promise of my beliefs. I don't expect to ever finish
      making multiple attempts to answer that question. That's what I mean in
      part by a poetry that changes as one reads it. My editorial work has
      always been&nbsp;a way to connect and correspond with writers that excite
      my poetic imagination. To borrow your concept, I'm attracted to those
      writers who have succeeded in clarifying&nbsp;a particular and personal
      &quot;ideaplace&quot; in their poetry and prose writing. The way others
      write effects the way I edit, and I've enjoyed how&nbsp;writer's
      contributions to an&nbsp;issue--beginning with <i>bloo</i> in Chicago to <i>Crayon</i>
      in New York City--shapes the editing &amp; thematic development of a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;journal.&nbsp;I
      don't know if there's something specific you'd like me to comment on
      regarding my editorial work, so I'll leave this for now.<o:p>

      paragraphs were composed earlier, I'd say about 1985.&nbsp;At the time I
      didn't know what to do with them. I&nbsp;read these early sections at the

      began to see the form as being somehow parallel to remembering and&nbsp;once

      reading &quot;from Indiana&quot; is akin to &quot;participatory reading as
      writing practice&quot; as a &quot;viable alternative space in which to
      create and examine the promise of one's beliefs.&quot; As far as origins
      go, I don't think I was&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in representing Indiana&nbsp;(specifically
      the most southern corner of the state). The origins are those of matter
      and memory -- the matter is language and something before it, as well as,
      for example, a singular referent like pumpkin pie<span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">,
      or falling out of a bunk bed through a bedroom window.</span> Around the
      time I was writing &quot;from Indiana&quot; I was neck deep in Heidegger's
      <i><span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">Being
      and Time</span></i> via a&nbsp;philosophy seminar taught by Professor Ed
      Casey at SUNY Stony Brook, but countering Martin H. was Walter Benjamin --&nbsp;in
      a space of two years I read everything then available in English. I found
      Benjamin's reflections on memory in&nbsp;the Baudelaire essay very
      instructive, as well as his idea of constellation as compositional method.
      I was also&nbsp;reading everything (some of it for a second time) by
      Gilbert Sorrentino, essays and novels, up through <i><span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">Aberration
      of Starlight</span></i>. Sorrentino was incredibly helpful for
      understanding how to share and shape one's material across more than one
      writing project.&nbsp;His novels&nbsp;are wonderful lessons on how to
      write. Origin, again,&nbsp;had to do with how &quot;Indiana&quot; as
      memory came into being&nbsp;and evolved. </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;

      of&nbsp;finding something one doesn't&nbsp;a priori possess&nbsp;consciousness
      of. This links I think to your earlier consideration of an &quot;ideaspace.&quot;
      Given what I've just said, I wouldn't at the same time want to denigrate
      the importance of the autobiographical material recontextualized, or
      de-formed. I do feel &quot;from Indiana&quot; succeeds in providing an
      experience of a particular place and time, <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">its</span>

      my memory of&nbsp;<i>My Life</i> (it must be close to 6-7 years since I've
      read it through), I'm caught up as a reader in the intricate details of

      something completely different.&nbsp;&quot;from Indiana&quot; falls more
      in the Jewish tradition of leaving the details of place and time
      ambiguous, less detailed -- I think of&nbsp;Auerbach's classic essay in <i><span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">Mimesis</span></i>

      in my dialogue with Jackson Mac Low at the Kelly Writers House a few years
      back. My idea in writing this sequence of 9 poems was to&nbsp;respond in
      critical, poetical and humorous fashion to the humorless aesthetic and
      political debate and discourse I was experiencing&nbsp;for the first time
      in depth on the www, having&nbsp;gained access via my adjunct teaching
      position at NYU. About 1994-95,&nbsp;Bob Harrison was sending me hardcopy
      &amp; email of&nbsp;an amazing array of wild, weird, and ideologically
      conservative materials he was gleaning while surfing the web. For
      instance, a document from the RAND <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">Corporation</span>
      on World War III,&nbsp;referred to again and again in the document as
      &quot;cyberwar.&quot; This document purported to inform the U.S.
      governmental intelligence community on the dangers lurking just over the
      horizon due to the increase in&nbsp;public access to <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">Internet</span>
      technology. I found the logic and argument of this document hilariously
      paranoid. <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">Dr.
      Strangelove could have penned it.</span> At the same time I was reading

      how</span>&nbsp;much of what passed for interested discussion of
      &quot;serious&quot; topics had become limited and banal. It appeared to be

      ideas and concerns for which an entire literature of thoughtful analysis&nbsp;had
      been discussed in pre-email fora. It was strange --&nbsp;a technological
      space of memory (the internet) that&nbsp;relied, I thought, on memory
      apart from a reliance on the &quot;recording&quot; of memory and thought&nbsp;one
      might associate with the paper world.&nbsp;Yet, the electronic world, with
      exceptions of course, seemed disinterested in that difference, or perhaps
      unaware of it. It presented&nbsp;a joyous embrace or excuse for (depending
      on one's viewpoint)&nbsp;<span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">narcissism</span>.&nbsp;So

      everything felt different and new. At a quick glance it looked like

      social cliques has been transforming itself on the <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">Internet</span>,

color:black">I think those things and people I'd count as influences on my
      writing keep changing. When I was first introduced to poetry, really, that
      it was an artform of some significance, when I was about twenty, I was
      lucky enough to be introduced to Stein, and Williams, and soon thereafter
      Jackson Mac Low, Jack Spicer, Bernadette Mayer and other younger
      contemporary writers. I've read (and taught) each of these poets many
      times since, and particularly love <i>Spring and All, </i>and The <i>Collected
      Books of Jack Spicer. </i>With <i>Paper Head Last Lyrics </i>I was
      directly influenced by the experimental novelist David Markson, and
      innumerable other writers and artists. Somewhere three-quarters of the way
      into the writing of the manuscript I took great enjoyment and inspiration
      reading William James' lectures at Oxford in 1908 and 1909 republished in
      1996 in a collection from University of Nebraska titled <i>A Pluralistic
      Universe. </i>I'd also count Jalal al-Din Rumi and Rilke as writers that
      I've held very close, Hannah Weiner, and the others I've mentioned earlier
      in our conversation. But the artists who I feel have marked and informed
      my poetry most deeply, especially in regard to the &quot;timed-arts&quot;
      are Elvin Jones, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Paul Motian, Paul Bley,
      Anthony Braxton with Dave Holland and Barry Altschul, and my friendship
      and collaborations with Gerry Hemingway. <o:p>

      musicians I've mentioned <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">feels</span>
      time in distinctly different ways. I remember a recording of Paul Bley
      with Ornette and I think it was Ed Blackwell on drums from the fifties in
      which Bley, during a solo, abstracted the time signature(s) &amp; melodic
      structure to such an extent that one of the greatest drummers in the world
      dropped out until Bley several minutes later reintroduced the melody
      straight up. That's something rare, something one hears in Sonny Rollins
      and that Braxton in his solo concerts from the late seventies and in the
      early eighties -- well, listening to Braxton then was unbelievable. The
      exactness of his conception and execution was so profound one could
      visualize the composition's structure in the concert hall as he'd
      mathematically dissemble it, the architecture of the space included,
      permutate the various components, reassemble them into new shapes and
      without once losing his place, as there was no place to lose, reintegrate
      the new fragments in a return to the original &quot;tune&quot; from a
      corner of the room one hadn't previously imagined existed all the while
      having mesmerized a couple hundred people or more. <o:p>

      under everything is Elvin Jones. I had a poster of Elvin on the wall
      behind my trapset throughout undergraduate school. When I was about
      nineteen I was fortunate enough to see him play at the Village Vanguard. I
      felt that at any minute Coltrane would walk around the corner of the bar
      and join in. The thing I loved about Elvin's playing, in addition to his
      sound and strength, was that I couldn't figure it out -- I could chart it
      intellectually, but I couldn't replicate the virtuosity with which he
      could play and imply multiple rhythms and meters simultaneously. My hands
      and feet had not yet evolved to that level of independence. Listen to
      Elvin's drums on <i>A Love Supreme, </i>or any of the other LPs of
      Coltrane's great quartet in which he's paired with Jimmy Garrison on bass.
      I've always wanted to know something about how the human body can do what
      his does in this music. When I wrote in <i>Curve, </i>&quot;ought to swing
      my arms / more my whole body,&quot; Jones was in my thoughts. <o:p>

      drummers Jones and Hemingway have taught me as writer, what I've attempted
      to translate from music to poetry, is how to listen to and balance or
      imbalance four, five, six or more things in the air at the same time. This
      know how, for instance, allowed me to weave the several narrative threads,
      often mere suggestions, various thematic circulation, echoes or memories
      that hold together a poem the length of &quot;Paper Head Last
      Lyrics,&quot; and that one can see and hear within and between the works
      collected in <i>Curve </i>and <i>Curve </i>2. I don't remember reading
      Yuri Tynianov's book, but the notion of &quot;remote rhyme&quot; sounds
      very suggestive if it's &quot;rhyme&quot; understood as a structural
      element that evolves across the length of something perhaps incorporating
      yet distinct from traditional rhyme schemes; an element that allows that
      something to extend itself, as in my description of Braxton's solo
      concerts, in the making of time. Gerhard Richter performs something
      complementary to that in the plastic arts. <o:p>

      the recordings of Thelonious Monk you can hear the players listening to
      one another. Monk and Paul Bley, for example, are exceptionally clear
      about this in the degree of silence that completes their compositions.
      There's an active listening, waiting, a gathering in time. There is a
      whole world yet to be discovered, not of unsolved issues but of
      relationships among things we know, of ways in which they might fit
      together. 'Intellectuals’, by contrast, appear to be comfortably intent
      on a logic that has little interest in diverse logical paths. And this
      attitude seems to tally with a partial sense of <i>logos </i>understood
      precisely as a capacity for ordering and explaining, detached from any
      propensity to receive and listen. The countless voices in our culture
      always propounding wise and rational arguments, arouse in us a desire to
      appear equally rational, and therefore to give assent by competing in the
      same style. 'Rigor' and, conversely, misunderstanding are deeply rooted in
      the exclusion of listening, in a trend which brooks no argument, where
      everyone obeys without too much fuss. What the various artists whose work
      I find influential show is a notion of integration linked to a general
      idea of coexistence (not fueled by the compulsion to analyze, explore,
      exhaust, probe) which is more ecological than logical in that it requires
      'belonging' to our <i>logos; </i>it is concerned with domestic issues
      because there are no more foreign affairs. The problem of 'distance' is
      that it defeats 'togetherness.' Listening aims at a possible conjugation
      of standpoints, a coexistential language that safeguards both proximity
      and distance. Perhaps it's the difference between aiming for success and
      aspiring towards progress. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;color:black">There's
      also the 'influence' of the context of that which one listens to -- be it
      a phrase that catches one's ear on television, to comments passed between
      elderly women on a stoop in Brooklyn, to one's own dreams and inner
      voices. The voices of one's parents, the voices of one's children. Of the
      person you love. It's not necessary to listen to the &quot;stars.&quot;
      Today, there may be some urgency in the value of listening more carefully
      to &quot;lesser&quot; voices. The mediating factor between composition and
      improvisation is one's attitude of attending to those who speak.
      Revelations depend upon the exercise of listening to oneself and to others
      and imply a basic trust - almost a hope. It's in that hopeful exercise of
      listening that beauty can be experienced. Beauty is emphatic, is an
      experience of empathy. That's something I became aware of this last year
      in working on my forthcoming book: <i>Still Mind is One Pepper. </i>I
      haven't been sure what the title of the work is, and it might change.
      However, &quot;Still Mind is One Pepper&quot; is a line that woke me up
      one morning after I'd completed the first draft of the manuscript and it's
      pushing aside other ideas. The working title was originally
      &quot;Triviality of Beauty,&quot; but early on I began to doubt the
      complication it set up. The problem was that I had come to the table with
      an &quot;idea&quot; in my head about beauty and that prevented things from
      happening, therefore I wasted a lot of paper. The revelation was that
      &quot;beauty&quot; in all its potential guises and definitions is the
      least trivial thing in the world. Everyone wants what's beautiful and
      that's why--in a narcissistic culture like our own--it's so hard to share.
      My sense of beauty is the capacity for heeding and corresponding with
      something - be it a thing, or a person. When one experiences that, the
      experience is not of one's own making. It takes its time. When one stops
      listening or discovers that one doesn't know how to listen the experience
      ceases, it no longer 'exists'. I had that high and low many times in my
      life as a practicing musician. If you're a &quot;professional&quot; you
      can fake it, but no one wants to do that for very long. <o:p>

      First, another kind of &quot;silence,&quot; which is willed, so that no

      For instance, silence as a form of activism.&nbsp; Whether the
      &quot;silent victims&quot; of our &quot;narcissistic culture&quot; will
      their own silence or it is the symptom of an imposed, elite will, or
      whether we do not hear the significance within / of that
      &quot;silence&quot; -- This was Cage's revelation:&nbsp; there is no
      silence, really.&nbsp; Secondly, how is such listening cultivated?&nbsp;
      It seems to me that many people simply lose their ears &amp; their voices
      in rumination, believing there's nothing necessarily vital to hear or say.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;

      your last reply on September 5<sup>th</sup> and today, October 11<sup>th</sup>,
      everything in our lives has changed. We're back in our apartment
      accompanied by a big HEPA air cleaner. The ruins are still burning and
      flaring up, and the air is really bad. I've been very concerned about it,
      especially for Gita. You can see the mound of what was building #7 at the
      end of our street (Greenwich), and police and National Guard are still in
      our neighborhood. In fact, there's a police barricade at our corner of
      North Moore and Greenwich where all vehicles, trucks especially, are
      checked before being allowed to pass to the west side highway where clean
      up crews and equipment are stationed. The major barricade is at Chambers
      Street. Everyone downtown is traumatized--some do a better job of
      disguising it than others, but one can tell—people are quieter than
      before. Watching the 2nd tower collapse from our kitchen window and seeing
      the rolling cloud of dust and debris heading in our direction was
      frightening, and surreal. Following the attacks on the WTC, when I finally
      got down in the street later that day, everyone was silent. People had
      spilled out of their apartments so that the sidewalk was more crowded than
      it ever is normally, even on a beautiful weekend. The quiet was nearly
      complete, eerie. Those talking were whispering. My home phone service was
      just restored this Monday. Sally, due both to her pregnancy and the
      empathy she’s felt for the victims of the terrorist attacks has suffered
      extreme anxiety, fright and utter exhaustion. I've cut everything out of
      my life except work and being home with her and Gita. <o:p>

font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;color:black">Getting back to your point on
      the ecological, the listening and response-ability resonating with
      Cage’s “getting out of the way,” I’d want to practice that and
      getting in the way when the moment calls for it. I’d like poetry to
      possess the strength to topple mountains within a world that would never
      require it. Sometimes it’s good to be quiet, sometimes to speak.
      Sometimes a pacifist must use his or her fist to survive and to protect
      those rights and liberties and people one holds dear. I agree that there
      can be “strategic silence,” sometimes the most scathing form of
      criticism is delivered in this way. Silence as a tool of dissent and
      activism is addressed in Agamben’s <i>The Coming Community</i>. In
      brief, what does power do with a community or group that forgoes or
      resists giving itself a name, an identifying label, with articulating
      easily reducible rhetoric that would play into the hands of those who
      would wish to domesticate and suppress it. That kind of silence, Agamben
      argues, is more of a threat to power than the throwing of stones. I’d
      agree with Cage’s perception that there really is no silence (especially
      true in NYC). Whether one’s silence is self-willed or imposed from
      without, or whether there’s an available audience to hear it… I would
      imagine in many instances that it’s all of these conditions operating in
      concert, so to speak. That’s why the work of listening is not easy.
      It’s the death of apathy. Even in our dialogue about poetry, my poetry,
      or your poetry, we skip things; we don’t hear exactly what the other
      person had in mind. I’ve felt myself reiterating, I hope not too
      redundantly some of the things you’ve said to better feel what you’re
      thinking, knowing that I can’t in actuality fathom it in its entirety.
      And this is what I find so rewarding and creative about the endeavor –
      the changeability of thought in its translation from one mind to
      another’s. I think that is the truest diversity one can celebrate.<o:p>

      listening? I’d think don’t discriminate in a punitive way against
      works in different styles than your own. I like living in a noisy and
      contentious democracy. It’s probably as valuable or even more so to
      listen carefully to those authors whose work differs stylistically as to
      that which bears more explicit resemblances to one’s immediate community
      of peers. To be intolerant and incapable of appreciating ways and means
      dissimilar to one’s own is a definite limitation. Politicians
      demonstrate an intellectual and moral hypocrisy again and again in their
      investments in fixed ideological formula. Remember to reject a formulaic
      poetics. For myself, listening to my 21 month old daughter speak is an
      extraordinary experience. Being quiet is an important exercise. Being able
      to write from the place of not being a writer is vital to my life, and to
      my growth as an artist.<o:p>

      there any correlation there? I don’t see “conditions” and
      “effects” as more than categorizations used for purposes of analysis.
      In one’s experiencing of conditions and the effects that may follow
      I’ve found there to be an extremely thin and permeable boundary. Which
      direction does one move in? To make an absolute distinction would be to
      essentialize time as uni-directional, linear. Progressive. You and I live
      in a country with a government that can fund its dissenters. From what

      </span>The material conditions of its publication, the “free” pdf
      chapbook format, suggested the already implicit thematic basis of
      “sorting” and multiple sorters (the things becoming sorted) – and
      connects to the ways in which so many of us have used the internet to get

      </span>I don’t remember saying that I thought time was “reversible,”
      but that time and one’s experiencing of its becoming may be a turn of
      such complexity as to be incomprehensible. And the something that
      manufactures the turn is again, I’d think, a plurality of elements. It
      may be experienced and understood in “isolate flecks,” to borrow a
      phrase from WCW, yet the multiplicity of elements may be impossible to
      ever completely isolate and identify (although certain bio-physicists and
      other theorists could argue that point). If there is some difference
      between the incomprehensible and that that “cannot be articulated,” it
      may be that space wherein one momentarily escapes socialization to
      discover just how mutable reality and one’s grasp of it is. To ask, what

font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;color:black">The use of dream material,
      imagery, language, is something that runs throughout everything I’ve
      written and published. As I mentioned earlier, the title of the
      forthcoming book from Zasterle came to me in a dream (although I want to
      mention that I’ve abandoned it and returned to the title I’d written
      down some months earlier, <i>Ashoka</i>. In Sanskrit Ashoka means “the
      active absence of sorrow”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thinking
      of dreams puts me in mind of that part of our conversation regarding
      participation, that is, writing/reading as a participatory art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I think I like the idea of reciprocity better. The subject while
      dreaming is sometimes while in the dream aware of herself in a reciprocal
      relationship with her waking life, i.e., is both subject and object.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It’s at these moments that I’ve been able to hear and hold on
      to something, a message that can make the passage back to wakefulness.
      That transversal or translation isn’t always successfully navigated. The
      reciprocation that occurs for the subject between the domains of waking
      and sleeping is sometimes one of separation and division, or doubling, as
      the subject is “somewhere” within that flux. Or to put it another way,
      I can’t always hold on to or easily identify my sense of self. To be a
      participant, on the other hand, would make things somewhat easier. The
      distinction I want to make is that to participate generally means that one
      is invited or given permission to participate without being able to assume
      thereby that one’s contribution is going to be equal to or as welcome as
      another’s. In most circumstances, one is invited due to the perception
      by others of a certain position or set of values that one
      “represents.” Reciprocity, in the sense in which I’m using it here,
      resonates differently; it’s both a psychological and sociological
      process.<o:p>

font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;color:black">I think that one of the
      dominant themes in the poetry I’ve written is the question of identity.
      What are its constituent parts, how is it assembled into a whole? Having
      an active dream life I’ve felt to be very useful in both experiencing
      and analyzing the various affiliations through which a sense of identity
      is composed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I’d like
      to imagine that whether in my writing or elsewhere I’m invested in the
      work of enabling all the different affiliations of which my self is made
      to be in dialogue with one another and on equal footing (most likely not
      possible at any one time, but that’s the ambition). Or, to give a
      simpler and more concrete example of how dream language enters the process
      of writing I’d connect it to our discussion about listening. Sometimes
      letting oneself go, drifting, listening to the words circulating around
      your thoughts without being eager to grasp them – that can be similar to
      entering a dream state. I have a definite memory of working on the
      sequence “Reading Places, Reading Times,” in <i>Values Chauffeur You</i>,
      where I was lying alongside a pool attempting to put into words what I saw
      happening on the water’s surface. I must have written a dozen or more
      attempts to grasp the way the wind played across the surface of the pool,
      but none of the lines were palpable enough. A little later that afternoon
      I lay down on the living room floor of my friend’s house and fell
      asleep. Perhaps a half an hour later I awoke with a start as the perfect
      lines had come to me in dreaming. Funny huh? Dreaming as a problem-solving
      tool.<o:p>

      </span>I wouldn’t think dreamlife to be a model or example. It’s a
      story in your head while you’re dreaming and your attention to it.
      Unless, that is, one can live and not experience dreaming. The more
      diverse the stimuli or affiliations (those constituent parts of one’s
      identity; ethnicity, religion, nationality, class, language, education,
      being a parent and many more things) the more complexity I’d think one
      experiences in one’s life. I don’t want to be misunderstood – an
      interest in and use of dream is one way I’ve found helpful in being
      active socially and politically, as in the way Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
      spoke of it in his famous “I have a dream” speech. King argues for the
      freedoms of individuals as against the “tribal” concept of identity;
      something everyone needs to guard against according to Amin Maalouf in his
      inspirational book <i>In the Name of Identity—Violence and the Need to
      Belong</i>. Life is a dream, and I believe that a dream is something a
      person can shape for good or bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maalouf
      also reminds us that texts don’t change; “what changes is the way we
      look at it. But the text affects reality only through the medium of our
      view of it, and in every era the eye dwells on certain phrases and skims
      over others without taking them in.” This idea fits with the way I’d
      think of dreams, the difference being that the dream does change as soon
      as one awakes and attempts to speak of it.<o:p>

      nuances. The small change. The social and existential, side by side.
      Something big gets constructed out of many small things. Bricks.”
      Another thing going for dreams is that they are your own text; they are
      not in someone else’s voice. Alexievitch writes that the tendency to
      deny one’s own text, to make it less immediate seems more often the not
      the province of “People of culture, intellectuals… You sit and listen
      to secondary texts-with their echo of newspapers, contemporary books,
      Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky. Usually only ordinary people tell their own
