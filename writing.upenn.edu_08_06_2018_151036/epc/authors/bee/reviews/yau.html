dated January 7, 1953,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Robert Creeley
stated: &quot;I wanted the <i>fastest</i> juxtaposition possible, and the <i>least</i>
explanatory manner.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>Clearly,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>subject
matter--something seen from the outside--is not what is at stake. Rather, one
hears Creeley's determined desire to extend the technical advances made by Ezra
Pound and Sergei Eisenstein, both of whom had been influenced by their study of
ideogrammatic languages. The statement was made some time after Creeley saw the
paintings of Jackson Pollock and other American abstract artists in Paris.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As he has acknowledged on a number of
occasions,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it was in the innovative work
of Pollock and other abstract artists,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>that Creeley recognized that there were others who wanted to subvert
their own and others's habits of thinking and seeing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Juxtaposition, the speed and economy of it, was understood as one
way such subversion could take place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">    </span>It is in Susan Bee's use of juxtaposition that she shares
something with figures as diverse as Pound, Eisenstein, and Creeley, not to
mention with artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and James Rosenquist.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>it is not what she and they have in common that is important, but what
she has done to make her juxtapositions particular to,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>as well as distinctive within, her
work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the most telling distinctions
between Bee's work and that of both Rauschenberg and Rosenquist lies in their
use of materials. Whereas Rauschenberg utilizes the silkscreen process and
Rosenquist the medium of oil paint to give their found images the same material
and visual presence, thus achieving an all-over consistency, Bee eschews this
approach, perhaps because she recognizes that it harnesses the differences into
a singleness that she can't accept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Instead, she keeps the paint as paint and cut-out images as printed
paper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">    </span>In Bee's assemblage paintings, disruption occurs on both a
material and visual level; it is both vertical and horizontal, reminding us
that however one can imagine the world fitting together, the things in it (and
we too are things) remain distinct and separate. Reconciliation is tentative
and fleeting, the result of the viewer's engagement with the work. Paint and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>painted images co-exist with
cut-out images. In this regard, Bee's paintings have more in common with
Rauschenberg's early assemblages than with his later work, before, that is, he
began refining his own approach. For it is one thing to want the &quot;fastest
juxtaposition&quot; possible, and quite another thing to want the smoothest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

any one scheme. There is no vantage point, material, spiritual, or otherwise,
from which we can see, much less understand, the entire world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

seemingly incommensurable readings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Chance,
it seems evident, plays a part. Ultimately, the openness of Bee's work prevents
the viewer from reaching any final conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

diverse possibilities, as well as incorporate nuggets of disparate information
into a viscous web of paint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In terms
of style and image, she knowingly and artfully collapses together passages of
high modernist abstraction with kitsch and sentimental images derived from
cut-out dolls and the covers of pulp novels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In terms of color and image, Bee's vocabulary is charged rather than
bland, heated rather than cool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In her
combinations of paint and cut-out images, the viewer encounters a world that is
simultaneously innocent and sinister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Knowing that she has a soft spot for the lurid,<span

playfulness is the artist's only goal, it isn't.<span style="mso-spacerun:

sectioned grounds, each of which is visually distinct,<span

Set into and against the paint,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the
cut-out figures, parts of pages, and bright stickers are both contiguous and
disruptive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In <i>Love is a Gentle Whip</i>
(1999), Bee divides the composition into three horizontal rows made up of
discrete areas (mostly different sized rectangles), each of which is painted
differently. The pink area in middle of the bottom row is both an homage to,
and parody of, the poured paintings of Jackson Pollock. It's Pollock perfectly
rendered in miniature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, and
this is where I think it is more than either an homage or a parody,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the pink ground reminds us that Pollock, for
all our sense of him being macho, had a predilection for such frou-frou colors
as pink and lavender. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

linguistically (it is &quot;organic&quot;) and visually (it is a rhythmic line)
echoes, as well as formally extends the swirling Pollock-like arabesques of
drips and splatters into another reality or discrete area. At the same time, in
the top row, a woman in a bright red dress lies sprawled on a receding,
patterned, triangular, abstract ground,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>blood and/or red paint flowing out of her and dripping down the front of
the painting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The resulting
echoes--blood and poured paint--reminds us the extent to which the world, in

shows, to supermarket tabloids, or we can obtain an understanding of them from
spiritual advisers via the telephone. There is always a stage, a place where we
can act out. And yet, rather than being dismissive of this aspect of reality,
Bee recognizes the difficulty of getting outside of the nexus of information,
weird signals, and powerful images each of us inhabits, as well as takes root
is us. In <i>Love is a Gentle Whip,</i> the distraught blonde on the left side
of the middle row,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>her hands pressing
against her head, is both kitsch and real, both fake and actual. The cut-out
sunflower rising to greet the painted, child-like sun, reminds us that we were
once innocent, and in that state of innocence we took a certain delight in
being manipulated by the mass media; it gave us pleasure.<span
