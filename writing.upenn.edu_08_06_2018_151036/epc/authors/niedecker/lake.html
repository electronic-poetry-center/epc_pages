      <blockquote> 
        <p>Doty: Mackinaw country ? Island: Many of the rocks are crusted over 
          with calcareous spar, particularly at Robinson's Folly.<br>
          <br>
          St. Mary's R. Here are whitefish of superior quality <br>
          <br>
          white, red and grey sandstone in river at Soo <br>
          <br>
          Grand Marais, 21 miles from the Two Hearted River (Michigan) <br>
          <br>
          &quot;as the season shifts&quot; <br>
          <br>
          S: &quot;no ardent spirits shall be hereafter introduced under any pretence, 
          into the Indian country&quot; <br>
          <br>
          Schoolcraft River <br>
          <br>
          a lake, Plantagenette (The Rest in the Path) water fowl shot ? the mallard, 
          wood-duck, sawbill <br>
          <br>
          Towards Rainy R. from North Shore ? ospreys dive for fish and eagles 
          swoop down to rid them of their catch. Timber wolves, bear, beaver. 
          Frenchmen came there early 18th century to look for the Sea of the West. 
          Scene 20 years ago now much the same as then <br>
          <br>
          The peace pipe the war chief smoked with his heart <br>
          <br>
          Indians ? S: &quot;a life of want and vicissitude&quot; <br>
          <br>
          &quot;lakes of a pondy character, redolent with nymphae odorata, thru 
          which we successfully passed.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          &quot;the naked solitudes of Red River&quot; <br>
          <br>
          32 ft. long canoe <br>
          <br>
          &quot;a portage of four pauses&quot; <br>
          <br>
          lake ? its outlet of a spreading, sandy shelly character ? no Indian 
          nor French name so as Mr. Johnston shot a deer here we named the lake 
          after him. Sibly Lake (other notes) <br>
          <br>
          un chanson du voyageur <br>
          <br>
          He presented a pipe <br>
          Miss. R. Valley ? the great carboniferous limestone formation which 
          fills it. <br>
          <br>
          At home we're in the drowned lands ? trees standing permanently in the 
          water. <br>
          <br>
          &quot;We slept on a kind of bog which the men call Tetes des femmes. 
          <br>
          <br>
          treaty of limits between the tribes <br>
          <br>
          Pike (of Pike's Peak) when he went up the Miss. R. ? north of the St. 
          Croix R. he said the river (Miss. I take it) became &quot;black in the 
          depths and clear in sandy shallows.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          calcite ? a native calcium carbonate also called calc spar, occurring 
          in many crystalline forms, such as chalk, marble, etc . . . <br>
          <br>
          The face of the earth is a graveyard and so it has always been. <br>
          <br>
          My inner midwest <br>
          <br>
          I was in a St. Ignace fog <br>
          <br>
          Why this fascination with rock terms, name, probably because we like 
          to think the first geologists took their finds and created them ? name 
          to thing ? out of the nature of things ? plus sometimes their sound 
          or reflection of colour that delighted their senses. </p>
