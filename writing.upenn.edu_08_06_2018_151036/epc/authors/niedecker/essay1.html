          -- For My Son When He Can Read</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Twenty-five 
          years before he wrote these statements in behalf of poetry, Zukofsky 
          began his long poem &quot;<i>A</i>.&quot; It was strange at that moment 
          of time and at that point in space. Many writers and readers, unless 
          travelling at the same speed, have lost contact with &quot;<i>A</i>&quot; 
          and some who wore dark glasses then are now beginning to see.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
          It is understandable that Lawrence Durrell, living in countries other 
          than the United States and so probably unaware of &quot;<i>A</i>,&quot; 
          should be thinking now along the same lines: &quot;Time has become . 
          . . welded in space -- no longer the quickly flowing river of the Christian 
          hymns moving from here to there along a marked series of stages. But 
          an always present yet always recurring thing.&quot; &quot;<i>A</i>&quot; 
          presents an order of succession but also of interweaving themes uniting 
          with new and related matter, tightening often into such forms as canzones 
          or ballades the tonality of our speech. The poet asked himself early 
          in the poem: &quot;<i>Can</i>/ The design/ Of the fugue/ Be transferred/ 
          To poetry?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
          Technically, a recurring thing, for all but the apathetic student, is 
          never the same -- though the<i> idea</i> of <i>recurrence</i> is useful 
          to establish relationships, to reveal kinship. There were journeys through 
          past hells, heavens -- flowing rivers still navigable by degrees. Zukofsky's 
          hell is today's and the good he finds is today's. From the incident 
          of a performance of Bach's <i>St. Matthew Passion</i> at Carnegie Hall 
          the poem moves to make the singing, living machine of our time. Now 
          with some 200 pages of &quot;<i>A</i>&quot; -- twelve movements -- we 
          see that here is one who has always been coming to where he is and who 
          wants to know what he has to live through to get further. Whether he 
          writes of live or inanimate objects or cities or minds, our usual notion 
          of poem is bound to be upset a little by the constant electronic interaction. 
          &quot;Three or four things occur at the same time making the difference 
          between Aristotelian expansive unities and the concentrated locus which 
          is the mind acting creatively upon the facts.&quot; --Z. in his preface

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> And of 
          horses: &quot;In another world/ We will not motor.&quot; (&quot;<i>A</i>&quot;-3) 
          We may not, say the wooden sawhorses of &quot;<i>A</i>&quot;-7, the 
          kicking horse rhythm and the flying manes of words -- horseplay if it 
          were not so serious. The poet resolves his criticism of poetry into 
          the movement of the poem. &quot;Street closed.&quot; The seven diggers 
          work on a street with eyes closed, ears closed. &quot;From me to them 
          no singing gut&quot; since everything says, including the poet &quot;We 
          want a meal, different techniques.&quot; Names and ideas from previous 
          movements of &quot;<i>A</i>&quot; are brought in again: Ricky, liveforever, 
          Shimaunu-San, clavicembalo. The theme of &quot;<i>A</i>&quot;-7 is one 
          that not everyone writing knows, even yet, this far past the depression: 
          that an intellectual, an artist, must sit on a stoop by himself when 
          everybody else has &quot;strayed,&quot; if they were there, &quot;on 
          a manhole.&quot;<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And now 
          we come to the eight themes of &quot;<i>A</i>&quot;-8, at least eight: 
          1, Labor as creator, as creature; 2, burial of Jesus in connection with 
          the <i>Passion</i> and what is to be said now; 3, Bach's life in relation 
          to all this and the previous parts of &quot;<i>A</i>&quot; and what 
          it means to the poet, how others might look at it, friends, different 
          mentalities, continuation of &quot;different techniques&quot; theme, 
          Kay etc. in earlier movements; theme 4, a history of history, composition 
          as action; theme 5, a chapter of American and international history; 
          6, of the nature of things; 7, matter thinking, bodily substance; reflections 
          of themes 5, 6, 7 in contemporary science: physics, mathematics (&quot;Infinite 
          is a meaningless word: except -- it states/ That our mind is capable 
          of performing/ an endless process of addition.&quot;) Each theme pumped 
          with the sound of an organ modulates into or is heard against the other, 
          until all go together. In music you would have eight voices, here the 
          words suggest all eight at once as the poem grows. A lecturer on modern 
          art recently said it can't just say this is a bad century, if it does, 
          -- it must show how it holds together. Zukofsky, in presenting economics 
          and politics, is, for all that, interested in recording a poem, in holding 
          together the parts: &quot;And of labor:/ Light lights in air,/ on streets, 
          on earth, in earth --/ Obvious as that horses eat oats --/ Labor as 
          creator,/ Labor as creature,/ To right praise.&quot; And without predatory 
          intent:</font></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
          First Half of &quot;A&quot;</i>-9, published in 1940, works economic 
          value and some concepts of modern physics into the canzone form. Here 
          again, Zukofsky is concerned with making a poem. &quot;<i>A</i>&quot;'s 
          ethics and politics are as old as Aristotle from whom Marx took, or 
          as old as Xenophanes (who took from the Old Testament?) or The Book 
          of the Dead: a distinction between use and unnatural use. The prose 
          statement on the form tells us of the mathematical analogue used in 
          translating the music of Cavalcanti's <i>Donna Mi Prega</i> into English. 
          &quot;The ratio of the accelerations of two sounds (r,n) has been made 
          equal to the ratio of the accelerations of the coordinates (x,y) of 
          a particle moving in a circular path with uniform angular velocity.&quot; 
          As a poet's labor of today the difficulties of transliterating internal 
          and end rhyme, odd assonance and consonance, eleven syllables and four 
          main stresses to a line, all of another century, were not enough. &quot;Applied 
          mathematics employs a quantity called 'Action' defined as the product 
          of energy and time. Perhaps things are such quanta of 'Action' when 
          they are defined as time congealed labor.&quot; Zukofsky turned labor 
          as abstraction &quot;into the labor present in the words of the song 
          itself&quot; (<i>Restatement</i>, &quot;<i>A</i>&quot;-9). The second 
          half of &quot;A&quot;-9 is another canzone, the rhyme almost identical 
          with that of the first -- the 13th century prosody and love -- recapitulated 
          in its 20th century definition as calculus of thought, but thought that 
          still has a shape: and so it balances the economics and physics of the 
          first half. Readers will not notice the calculus, only the sound, the 
          energy, and that is the art of it. A great deal of modern art and literature 
          is tissue wrapping paper, not stuff that is tough. Zukofsky's stuff 
          is tough. The first two strophes and coda of the first half are:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> An 
            impulse to action sings of a semblance<br>

            The measure all use is time congealed labor<br>
            In which abstraction things keep no resemblance<br>
            To goods created; integrated all hues<br>
            Hide their natural use to one or one's neighbor.<br>
            So that were the things they could say: Light is<br>
            Like night is like us when we meet our mentors<br>
            Use hardly enters into their exchanges,<br>
            Bought to be sold things, our value arranges;<br>
            We flee people who made us as a right is<br>
            Whose sight is quick to choose us as frequenters,<br>
            But see our centers do not show the changes<br>
            Of human labor our value estranges.</font></p>

          continuum. According to his essay <i>Bottom</i> (New Directions 14) 
          which is the beginning of a book on Shakespeare, both the Bard and Spinoza 
          looked up to Ovid, and thirty-five years after the publication of the 
          First Folio Spinoza had abstracted Shakespeare's drama. &quot;<i>A</i>&quot;-12 
          says this too, and much else -- notably Lucretius as the creator of 
          Hotspur might have read him, a chart of learning to be taken lightly 
          (sic), Paracelsus (without Browning's fuss), a graph of Plato and an 
          integration of actual present-day letters. Editors have spoken of its

          Multiple interest, poetry following an order of speech, new ideas generating

          at times there is still &quot;too much air in the air.&quot; There is 
          also the dictum to mean exactly what you mean. Poets who reach out ahead 
          of readers necessarily find themselves called obscure. A current of 
          reality always exists in Zukofsky even if involved. It is one of his 
          own tenets that &quot;The emotional quality of good poetry is founded 
          on exact observation&quot; (<i>A Test of Poetry</i>, Routledge &amp; 
          Kegan Paul, Ltd., London, 1952). <i>Anew</i> (1946) contains the lovely, 
          minutely in-wreathed flowering of Zukofsky's poetic genius. The poems 
          are at once objective and intimate, written, many of them, for members 
          of the family and for friends -- sent to friends on postcards or valentines 
          -- the years' greetings whose forms are completed by Celia Zukofsky's

          <i>Anew</i> we are given a sense of the perpetually active, as love 
          is. William Carlos Williams has said, &quot;This book is brilliant through 
          an over-all consciousness of its own warmth, its own despairs, its own 
          excellence in the writing. It is happy, happy of a welcoming warmth. 
          That is one of its subtlest and most obvious successes -- its serenity 
          in love. For by knowing how to write Zukofsky has found it possible 
          again to express love. You cannot express anything unless you invent 
          how to express it. A poem is not a freudian 'escape' (what childlishness) 
          but an adult release to knowledge, in the most practical, engineering 
          manner.&quot;<br>
