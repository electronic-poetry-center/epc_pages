      <p align="left">On 5 January 1971, six days after her death, the <i>Wisconsin 
        State Journal</i> published the following letter written by Basil Bunting 
        from his home in Wylam, UK:<br>
        <br>
        Lorine Niedecker . . . will be remembered long and warmly in England, 
        a country she never visited. She was, in the estimation of many, the most 
        interesting woman poet America has yet produced. Her work was austere, 
        free of all ornament, relying on the fundamental rhythms of concise statement, 
        so that to many readers it must have seemed strange and bare. She was 
        only beginning to be appreciated when she died, but I have no doubt at 
        all that in 10 years time Wisconsin will know that she was its most considerable 
        literary figure.</p>

      <p align="left"><b>On <i>Lorine Niedecker: Woman and Poet:</i></b> Lorine 
        Niedecker was the only woman among the Objectivist poets. Marginalized 
        by her cultural isolation in rural Wisconsin, by poverty, and by her position 
        as a woman writer, Niedecker dedicated her life to working out the implications 
        of a rigorous poetics that she developed in the 1930s, in an ongoing dialogue 
        with Zukofsky. Since her death in 1970, her work has won increasing critical 
        recognition. A new edition of her collected poems, now under preparation, 
        will certainly confirm her position as one of the great poets of our century.<br>
        <br>
        This volume, the 14th in NPF's Man/Woman and Poet Series, offers the first 
        comprehensive biographical, critical, and bibliographic overview of Niedecker's 
        career. The biographical materials include an important memoir by Jerry 
        Reisman, who knew Niedecker and Louis Zukofsky during the 1930s, along 
        with other memoirs by friends of Niedecker; three substantial groups of 
        previously unpublished letters; and essays by Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Jane 
        Augustine, and Marjorie Perloff on the way Niedecker's experiences as 
        a woman writer affected her work.<br>
        <br>
        Critical essays in the volume include contributions, most written specifically 
        for this volume, by Peter Nicholls, Peter Quartermain, Michael Heller, 
        Jeffrey Peterson, Richard Caddel, Gilbert Sorrentino, Kenneth Cox, Douglas 
        Crase, Joseph M. Conte, Donald Davie, and Lisa Pater Faranda. The volume 
        concludes with an annotated bibliography of critical and scholarly works 
        on Niedecker from 1947 to 1995, prepared by Tandy Sturgeon. The book is 
        illustrated with many previously unpublished photographs.</p>
