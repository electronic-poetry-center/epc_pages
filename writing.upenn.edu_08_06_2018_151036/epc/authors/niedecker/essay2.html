      <blockquote> 
        <p>In Basho's day, poems were left on posts. Today -- and not surprisingly 
          Japan-associated -- we come upon several solitary posts -- nine books 
          in six years, poems rare and at the same time numerous, by the one author 
          Cid Corman. He is also editor of the poetry journal <i>Origin</i>, his 
          present home Kyoto.</p>
        <p> Corman is the poet of quiet. &quot;Each man an empire when he enters/a 
          silence.&quot; And again: &quot;There are things to be said. But to 
          whom tell/the silences?&quot; They're told but he's careful -- o he's 
          suspicious as the devil of too many words. Of thought, even --</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> <b>The fabric</b></p>
          <p> downstairs as<br>
            I look in<br>
            from the street</p>
          <p> I can catch<br>
            the loom and<br>
            can sense the</p>
          <p> heartbeat<br>
            strengthen the<br>
            night coming</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Not to have thought through/anything and yet/only through this 
          day/to have thought at all.&quot;<br>
          Poems precise, plain and sweet --</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> At day's end<br>
            child asleep<br>
            in his arms</p>
          <p> he steps light --<br>
            her bonnet<br>
            on his head.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> And</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><br>
            <b>The Offerings </b></p>
          <p> Too many things on the altar.<br>
            A petal would do.<br>
            Or the ant that stops for a moment at it.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Reminds one of Williams' &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot;? To add to 
          &quot;The Offerings&quot; would be to hold up an extra finger as Basho 
          said when he found the perfect poem. <i>All in All</i>, which contains 
          this Corman poem, is in format and contents -- a large book with drawings 
          (illuminations) by Hidetaka Ohno -- one of the most beautiful books 
          of our time.</p>
        <p> Short poems on large subjects: Wonder, Contentment. But solid. &quot;Either 
          you are here/or you're not. And/if you are, this is the place to stand&quot; 
          -- </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> I picked a<br>
            leaf up</p>
          <p> it weighed<br>
            my vision</p>
          <p> I knelt and<br>
            placed it</p>
          <p> almost<br>
            where it was</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&quot;to contemplate/contentment&quot; --</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> Tea in the green fields<br>
            served by a monk, green<br>
            tea, all that he has.</p>
          <p> Through the light thatched roof<br>
            the sky gets in and<br>
            at the edges more.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In fact, &quot;One gets/to care less for all/save downright good feeling&quot; 
          --</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> The rain steadies<br>
            wisdom. After<br>
            the silences</p>
          <p> are drummed out, from<br>
            the wild depths of<br>
            the heart the one</p>
          <p> native hears truth.<br>
            He emerges<br>
            in the sun light.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And &quot;hands clap/invoking warmth/beating time to/a slow snow.&quot;</p>
        <p> Little still states. World news: sun on the sill; a bug: &quot;A black 
          and gold beetle/weighs a grass/to whose end it walks&quot;; the rain 
          gathering at the end of the pine needle &quot;in sudden water-buds that/as 
          suddenly descend&quot;; a friend who is quiet:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> The hand that I hold to the light<br>
            fills. What more do I offer you,<br>
            my love, than what the light gives?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Use what there is, the poet tells himself, &quot;the mystery of the 
          simple seeing.&quot; Express suspense. Express <i>listen</i>! --</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> rain stops<br>
            night knows when<br>
            to listen</p>
          <p> what falls<br>
            glistens now<br>
            in the ear</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Corman country there is no violence or hate.</p>
        <p> Basho's concern was to publish very little, Cid Corman's to publish 
          and let the leaf stay where it falls. Let those read with joy who are 
          worthy. And another year more leaves come into being.<br>
