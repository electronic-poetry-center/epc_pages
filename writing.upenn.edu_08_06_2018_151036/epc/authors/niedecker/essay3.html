      <blockquote> 
        <p> Zukofsky's arrangement is as clean in form as its criticism and the 
          good examples of poetry it offers. It is appraised correctly on the 
          jacket of the book by Clifton Fadiman, Mark Van Doren and William Carlos 
          Williams. Distilled excellence, rich portions from the poets from Homer 
          thru the present, some of these difficult -- poetry is not soft -- supported 
          by Zukofsky's precise interpretive remarks. &quot;The lines of poetry 
          of great emotional significance in any age are rare. To obtain, therefore, 
          an accurate criticism of them and of the lesser work which surrounds 
          them, reading should not shun analysis.&quot; To read for pleasure, 
          that is the aim here. Poetry out of the &quot;living processes&quot; 
          of everyday and from there &quot;to always another phase of existence&quot; 
          -- the world needs it.</p>
        <p><br>
          What makes certain lines of poetry good and others not so good? Part 
          II, the pivot for the entire book, begins so far as Zukofsky's remarks 
          are concerned: &quot;A simple order of speech is an asset in poetry.&quot; 
          Next, in that section, regarding William Morris' roundabout translation 
          of Homer: &quot;He is piling it on thin.&quot; And we're off. Parts 
          I and III offer more examples of good poetry, but without comment or 
          authors' signatures -- to add to the zest of a lovely game. A turn to 
          the chronological chart shows the full use of an index with titles, 
          authors, dates when supplemented by standards such as &quot;content,&quot; 
          &quot;emotion,&quot; &quot;inevitability,&quot; &quot;measure.&quot; 
          A book for the general sensitive reader -- in classroom and out.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Zukofsky is moved, of course, by certain perceptions: the exact word; 
          any word a poetic word &quot;if used in the right order, with the right 
          cadence, with a definite aim in view&quot;; &quot;song, one of the mainsprings 
          of poetry&quot;; a poem: &quot;an emotional object&quot; close to the 
          people and their experiences, i.e., the source, something to put your 
          hands on as against metaphysical rockers; &quot;in any age&quot; . . 
          . &quot;The lasting attraction in the words of a poem and its construction 
          make it classic and contemporary at the same time.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>In this day of adding machines in bookshop windows, or comic greeting 
          cards, the surface tilt, the armed avoidance of quiet, of deep satisfaction, 
          this book is printed. The book could be bigger -- the reader can make 
          it so. Omissions -- at first glance -- until one realizes that it is 
          more than an anthology. <br>
