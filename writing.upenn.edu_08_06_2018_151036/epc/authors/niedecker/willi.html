        <p align="left"> Some of you may be wondering what Lorine Niedecker has 
          to do with the major concerns of the 1960s<font color="#996600"><b><font size="2">.1</font></b></font> 
          What could such a minimalist, domestic writer with such circumscribed 
          concerns as keeping the wind and water out of her small marshy house 
          and making her own clothes have to do with the monumental political 
          and intellectual concerns of the Vietnam war era, the civil rights movement, 
          free love, and the increasing stylization and popularization of an American 
          counterculture? Objectivism was, after all, a movement of the 1930s, 
          associated with populist concerns and communist politics. But with World 
          War II, the red scare, and pervasive blacklisting in the arts, it wasn't 
          until the 1960s that objectivist poetry had its long-awaited afterlife.<br>
          <br>
          The reasons for the resurfacing of objectivist poetics are, of course, 
          historically and philosophically complex. But if we look even at the 
          surface of 60s popular culture, the style of the 1930s-particularly 
          the presence of folk and labor concerns and their representation within 
          popular media-is everywhere manifest. In politics an increased belief 
          in the efficacy of political protest fueled a grassroots politics of 
          resistance; in women's fashion, there was the &quot;peasant&quot; blouse; 
          in music it was Arlo rather than Woody Guthrie, and folk-based musicians 
          from Bob Dylan to The Band to Pete Seeger and the Kingston Trio were 
          appearing on TV. The 60s was the era of Niedecker's renaissance, too; 
          it was the period of nearly all her book publications, the repeated 
          re-editing and re-arrangement of her poems, and the development of her 
          longer serial works. While it would be valuable to consider the ways 
          in which Niedecker's poetry embodies the major concerns of the 1960s-and 
          it does touch upon those I've mentioned-I want to focus primarily on 
          Niedecker's notion of &quot;folk&quot; and its relation to the commodity 
          status of the poem, her conception of poetic composition and possession, 
          and her relation to her cultural sources. <br>
          <br>
          To look at Niedecker as a kind of folk poet is, of course, not to suggest 
          she was a naive, unschooled in the world beyond her Black Hawk Island. 
          As Rachel Blau DuPlessis points out in her essay on &quot;Niedecker, 
          Gender, &amp; Class,&quot; and Jenny Penberthy notes in her introduction 
          to the Niedecker/Zukofsky correspondence, Niedecker distinguishes herself 
          very early on from the culture around her.<font size="2"><b><font color="#996600">2</font></b></font> 
          Her first published poem, &quot;Wasted Energy&quot; is a recasting of 
          folk material, focusing on differences in class- and culture-based language 
          usage.<font size="2"><b><font color="#996600">3</font></b></font> In 
          schoolish sing-song, Niedecker reports on her environment like an anthropologist; 
          the poet-reporter is clearly set apart from the subjects whose speech-acts 
          she records.<br>
          Her World War II poem &quot;In the great snowfall before the bomb&quot; 
          also explicitly displays and elaborates on the poet's cultural position. 
          In it, the speaker is separated from the &quot;folk&quot; as writer 
          and as woman, though they provide her with &quot;material&quot;:</p>

        </div>
        <blockquote>

            and dreadfully much else....&quot; (GP 21) <br>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left">Here, the print shop setting foregrounds our awareness 
          of the object status of letters, words, and syntax, as the physical 
          stuff of poems. The fact that she worked &quot;right down among em&quot; 
          and in fact needed this work for her survival keeps her from seeming 
          like management to their labor. The &quot;folk&quot; merely provide 
          her with the raw material which it becomes her equally labor-laden job 
          to condense into poetry. The poem's ending points to the difference 
          in her labor as a difference in time frame. Compared to the frenetic 
          pace of the print shop, the poem appears to develop almost geologically; 
          or to reiterate the place of the poem as an embodiment of gender difference, 
          like an egg that it takes a lot of sedentary labor to hatch:</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p align="left"><br>
          The poem is a way of compressing world into word: as Marianne Moore 
          wrote poems out of the material of travel brochures and electric bills, 
          Niedecker found poetry in the gossip that flowed through the offices 
          of Hoard's Dairyman in the 1940s as much as in her research on Wisconsin 
          history and geography for the Federal Writers' Project.<br>
          <br>
          By virtue of her love for and detachment from the culture within which 
          she lived, she was able to collect and compress folk material, hearsay, 
          gossip, and regionalisms as material for poetry in much the way that 
          Charles Reznikoff shaped documentary reportage within <i>Testimony</i>. 
          The mature work of both writers behaves according to the key poetic 
          principles extolled by Zukofsky: objectivity and sincerity. The combination 
          of these two terms meant giving up the romanticism inherent in high 
          modernism-particularly its positioning of the subjective self within 
          the poem-without becoming too detached from the subject per se as a 
          vehicle for human content. The poem instead could be viewed as a product 
          of collectivity, a fossil-like record of the pressures of the culture 
          that shape the individual rather than an investment in the mythology 
          of the poet's ability to legislate the culture. From this perspective 
          it is easier to see modernism, with its mythologies of genius, as an 
          extension of romanticism-and objectivism as a greater break from modernism 
          than it might initially appear.<br>
          <br>
          In balancing the objective and the sincere, Reznikoff documents the 
          violence within American culture without reducing it to political message-making. 
          Its &quot;objective&quot; presentation is the very cause of its perceived 
          sincerity, opening the way for a motive as well as emotive-empathic 
          and political-response. Similarly, Niedecker celebrates the richness 
          of folk language while acknowledging the brutality of the culture it 
          supports. Collecting found usage as material for her poetic condensery, 
          Niedecker asserts the aesthetic value of working class, non-literary 
          readings of the culture from which she emerges-without suggesting that 
          it is in any way superior to, say, a more conventionally literary culture. 
          Like <i>Testimony</i>, her poems vibrate with both celebration and deep-seated 
          criticism. While the folk quality of her poems makes them appear accessible, 
          they often narrate a meaningful resistance to cultural assimilation. 
          A good example is the shifting power dynamic embodied within the &quot;great 
          snowfall&quot; poem in which the guys down in the print shop &quot;called 
          me Blondie.&quot; This nicknaming can be read as an endearment, a sexual 
          slur, and/or as wryly ironic and self-mocking; if we read Niedecker 
          herself as the antecedent of the poem's I, one can see the richness 
          in assigning a bespectacled proofreader with a college degree the status 
          of a dumb-blonde pin-up or balloon-breasted comic-strip character. The 
          act of writing the poem is, among other things, a way of literally capturing 
          her verbal opponents on her home turf. By recording the interchange 
          with terse and critical humor, Niedecker responds in a folkway that 
          is entirely in keeping with her &quot;place&quot; in more than a geographical 
          sense. <br>
          <br>
          Clearly, Niedecker herself is not excluded from this critical voice. 
          In fact, her simultaneously proud and self-denegrating commentary drives 
          her poetic style, keeping her poems unsettled and unsettling. This critical 
          stance also appears in a letter she writes to Zukofsky, in which she 
          quotes directly a letter she received from Ian Hamilton Finlay who tried 
          to get her to record her poems on cassette for a &quot;folk&quot; recording: 
          &quot;I know this man who plays a guitar: he actually leads a folk group 
          which is having its first disc made at present in USA, and I showed 
          your poems to his wife, she was enthusiastic about my idea, which is 
          that you somehow get the loan of a tape machine, and TALK these poems 
          onto some tape, then post it over, and I'll get this man to add guitar.....&quot; 
          (NCZ 329) Later Niedecker writes: &quot;Mebbe I shdn't ever have gone 
          to NY to meet the real writer but shd. have stayed in my little country 
          patch and written country ballads to be sung with a geetar. (FTC 326) 
          The passage is typical of Niedecker's tone; she manages at once to chide 
          Zukofsky for staying in New York (thus he's a &quot;real writer,&quot; 
          but one without great courage) while she mocks her own public image 
          and relative obscurity. Beyond its perceived authenticity, Niedecker 
          would have seen &quot;folk&quot; as ideal material for the objectivist 
          ethos for several reasons: its populist stance and approachability; 
          its focus on a collective rather than an individual process of making; 
          its interest in non-specialized access to meaning; and in Niedecker's 
          case especially, its blurring of ownership boundaries by engaging in 
          anonymous and temporally-layered multiple-author composition.<br>
          In fact, ownership-literary and otherwise-was one of the central concerns 
          of Niedecker's poetry. Her biographical relation to property was conflicted. 
          Her grandmother was the first woman on record as owning property in 
          the state of Wisconsin. But most of the family property was eventually 
          lost, and the burden of owning and maintaining property-and of possibly 
          having to evict someone who couldn't make his mortgage payments-is voiced 
          as an oppressive concern in both her letters and poems of the 1960s. 
          (NCZ 328) She writes to Zukofsky in December 1962: &quot;the nation's 
          wealth might be in the hands of women but they're having a hell of a 
          time&quot; (NCZ 326) <br>
          <br>
          In her correspondence with Zukofsky, it is clear that a certain sense 
          of intellectual and poetic property abides between them as well-and 
          is occasionally violated. At one point Niedecker reports an anecdote 
          to Zukofsky while warning him not to use it, as she's &quot;got a lien 
          on it.&quot; (NCZ 15) In her later poems, her preoccupation with ownership 
          becomes more intense. It complicates her relation to the Zukofskys, 
          as she clearly considered Paul part of her communal life and not merely 
          the property of Louis's nuclear family. In her quest for literary collectivity 
          her poems become increasingly enthralled with the physical, geological, 
          historical world, the objective unownable world-a sensibility akin to 
          that of Black Hawk specifically and of the native American presence 
          generally, which informs her later poems about place.</p>
        <p align="center"> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="4" color="#996600">***</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"> Her early poem &quot;When Ecstasy Is Inconvenient&quot;-generally 
          seen as a more rhetorical, message-driven poem than most of her later 
          work-points to the liminal experience of lyric possession, of brushing 
          up against the unknown force within language, which it is the work of 
          the poem to transmit. And yet it too comes into focus around the issue 
          of containment-that is, the invention of a story to explain away the 
          very &quot;ecstasy&quot; of composition which it presents.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p align="left">Implied in this decisive closure is the notion of the 
          poem as a container for the uncontainable, a way of possessing possession. 
          Published in the pages of the magazine in which she first encountered 
          Zukofsky, we might also consider the ways in which it presages her relation 
          to him, including the sense that a moment of &quot;gay transport&quot; 
          could end by &quot;containing&quot; its progeny through abortion or 
          that it could be transformed into an intense written correspondence-both 
          acts that involve taking things into in one's own hands.<font size="2"><b><font color="#996600">4</font></b></font> 
          <br>
          <br>
          While this poem is generally seen as an early aberration in Niedecker's 
          opus, representing her surrealist phase, her later work often resonates 
          with a similar combination of mysticism and high gothic drama, though 
          it tends toward a more comic tone and focuses more on worldly effects 
          rather than supernatural sources. On a practical level, overheard fragments 
          of conversation, gossip, anecdote, and epistle, all bear the traces 
          of previous owners and lend themselves to a displacement of subjectivity. 
          Such folk forms are perfect media for hauntings and enactments of possession. 
          At the same time, their ownership, their status as possessions, is complex. 
          <br>
          <br>
          While acquisition was and is the most obvious preoccupation of American 
          life, Niedecker seems to suggest alternatively that one could be possessed 
          by (absorbed with) an objective observation of the movement of things, 
          an awareness that as subjects we are all just passing through. Think 
          of &quot;Traces of Living Things,&quot; &quot;Paean to Place,&quot; 
          etc., which, for all the unified voicing of Niedecker's poems-especially 
          the &quot;folk&quot; poems-demystify and de-emphasize the position of 
          the speaker as the maker of reality. The condensery that kicks out poems 
          is a site for material transformation, not concoction.<br>
          <br>
          So it is useful to look at Niedecker's poems for what they say, often 
          in deflected as well as condensed ways, about the process of making. 
          &quot;I rose from marsh mud&quot; has been discussed as an enactment 
          of biological and social Darwinism: the human descends taxonomically 
          from the muck, through the steady transformation of the geological earth 
          itself.</p>

        <p align="left">But here the origin and descent of the species is reversed; 
          it becomes a rising up, with its resonance of class struggle intact 
          and with its contradictory working-class dream of social ascendency 
          through one's profession as a writer. The I in the poem can be read 
          as both the poet and the poem-a statement of poetic and biographical 
          process. The poem arises-a living object that evolves into being, rather 
          than being &quot;made&quot;-from base raw materials (like the iron in 
          the blood in &quot;Lake Superior&quot;). Rather than being a triumphal 
          ascent, the social ascendency witnessed in the &quot;rich rich silence 
          of the church&quot; is a mockery of the evolutionary/creative process 
          itself.<font size="2"><b><font color="#996600">5</font></b></font> In 
          contrast, the poem's contrapuntal I comes out of dead organic matter, 
          like the creature from the Black Lagoon-or to be more literary about 
          it, <i>Frankenstein</i>'s monster-patched together cast-off material 
          that brings with it the &quot;traces of living things.&quot; In this 
          poem that asserts an evolutionary reality rather than a creationist 
          mythology, the poet's &quot;hideous progeny,&quot; like Mary Shelley's, 
          comes to stand in the place of both the created and its creator, author 
          and poem. Like <i>Frankenstein</i>'s monster, the objective poem comes 
          back to haunt and even argue with its maker-not to mention, embarrassing 
          her with the mud still clinging to its shoes.<font size="2"><b><font color="#996600">6</font></b></font> 
          <br>
          <br>
          In this way, Niedecker's opus seems less about place in a geographical 
          sense (she certainly disliked the notion of being a &quot;regional&quot; 
          poet) than it is about knowing one's place: that is, about where the 
          poet fits into the culture and how one travels through and within the 
          interstices of class and regional identity-owning up to one's debased 
          roots, whether they lead back to colonial explorers or the &quot;natives&quot; 
          who pull out their fingernails, or both. (&quot;Lake Superior,&quot; 
          GP 64-65)</p>

        <p align="left"> The interlocking concerns of creation, artistic &quot;possession,&quot; 
          class consciousness, marital strife, monstrous birth, and the prospect 
          of abject poverty linked Niedecker with Mary Shelley as well. While 
          Penberthy rightly points out the danger in reading poems with too steady 
          an eye on Niedecker's biography, Niedecker herself performs a combination 
          of biographical, autobiographical and literary-historical readings of 
          Mary Shelley in her poem &quot;Who Was Mary Shelley?&quot; Placing the 
          poem in a section of &quot;ballads,&quot; Niedecker seems to point to 
          both an unauthorized folk source and a sense that even great women's 
          lives tend to be remarked in oral narrative and hearsay; that they appear 
          in history as ciphers, as monsters, or as the bearers of monsters, their 
          identity formed by the biological confluence of life and death. <br>
          <br>
          Poetically speaking Niedecker arose, by her own account, with her discovery 
          of the objectivist issue of <i>Poetry</i> in 1931, the hundredth anniversary 
          of the publication of Mary Shelley's revised <i>Frankenstein</i> and 
          the year in which it was released as a major motion picture in the US.<font size="2"><b><font color="#996600">7</font></b></font> 
          Thirty-one years later, in September 1962, Niedecker writes to Zukofsky 
          of reading Eileen Bigland's biography of Mary Shelley (she had also 
          read Trelawny's <i>Last Days of Byron and Shelley</i>) and uses it to 
          calibrate and reassess the scale of her own woes, which shrink in comparison. 
          A week later she writes him a postscript about Jonathan Williams's review 
          of her own collection <i>My Friend Tree</i>: &quot;I wdn't know how 
          to write poetry without Zukofsky and J. wdn't know how to review me 
          without Zukofsky.&quot; (NCZ 321-2) A study of the jacket copy and reviews 
          of Niedecker's books and of the Niedecker/Zukofsky correspondence shows 
          this is far from an isolated occasion. She repeatedly receives praise 
          that is qualified by considerations of gender and location; her poems 
          are often eclipsed by the biographical, and by the identification of 
          Zukofsky as her male mentor. To complicate things further, she writes 
          an entire collection of poems for Zukofsky's son Paul, partly &quot;condensed&quot; 
          of anecdotes shared within their correspondence. Their problematically 
          fluid negotiation of literary ownership and identity resonates easily 
          with Mary and Percy Shelley's conflated and conflicted personae: the 
          first edition of <i>Frankenstein</i> appeared anonymously with Percy's 
          ghostwritten introduction in 1818; subtitled &quot;a modern Prometheus&quot; 
          the novel appeared two years before Percy's <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>, 
          though he had announced his desire to rewrite the Prometheus myth as 
          early as 1816. <br>
          <br>
          Niedecker's American gothic treatment of gender and marriage also resurfaces 
          in the poem &quot;I married&quot; in which the coffin-like claustrophobia 
          of the semantic box where the couple lies together is reiterated at 
          the end of the poem by the suggestion that the speaker has become-or 
          sees herself as-a zombie, undead:</p>

        <p align="left">So, at the other end of her career, Niedecker returns 
          thematically to the concerns of &quot;When Ecstasy Is Inconvenient&quot; 
          with its anticipation of-and voiced resistance to-other-worldly possession. 
          In the later poem it seems Niedecker has taken to heart the imperatives 
          of the early poem; what could be a more convincing manifestation of 
          &quot;feigning a great calm&quot; than playing dead in one's coffin-like 
          house, surrendering up one's subjectivity entirely? The shift belies 
          a further extension of objectivist thinking: not only is the poem an 
          object but so is the poet. In classic Niedecker style, though, the underpinnings 
          of this &quot;rich&quot; meaning are tongue-in-cheek and evoke the low 
          source material of pulp horror.<br>
          <br>
          Disturbing the gothic content of the poem with comic, Mother Goose-like 
          phrasing (&quot;head in the closet,&quot; etc.), the whole is turned 
          around one last time with the final line &quot;I thought,&quot; introducing 
          the possibility that the entire poem may be read as a fiction, or merely 
          attributable to subjective emotional processing, or even as the product 
          of paranoia. The accuracy of the poem's content is called into question 
          by pointing to the slippery nature of reality and consciousness itself, 
          and so the claustrophobic physical space of the poem can be explained 
          as a phantasm, a problem of perspective or of mind, of being too self-absorbed-a 
          quality that would grate against her midwestern pragmatism as well as 
          her objectivist poetics.<br>
          <br>
          Finally I want to suggest that in her &quot;folk&quot; method of reprocessing 
          pre-owned material, particularly her reworking of 19th-century literature 
          (Charles Darwin, William Morris, John Ruskin, Mary Shelley), Niedecker 
          is a great poet of lateness. That is, she finds her poetic ground in 
          looking back rather than forward, down rather than up, by embracing 
          the imperative to condense and eschewing the notion of the new with 
          its attendant commodification of the avant-garde. Recontextualized as 
          &quot;late,&quot; Niedecker embraces the anticonsumerist collectivity 
          of folk retellings, even if it means appearing with algae and equisitum 
          on her boots, jello in her fridge, and lowdown culture in her poems.</p>

          Also released as a movie that year was the Joan Crawford/Clark Gable 
          vehicle <i>Possessed</i>, which may reflect on Niedecker's poem &quot;I 
          rose from marsh mud.&quot; Both films deal with identity, class consciousness 
          and mobility, creativity, matrimony, and procreation, issues which resurface 
          throughout Niedecker's work and which come together in an interesting 
          way in the 1964 poem &quot;Who was Mary Shelley?&quot; In <i>Possessed</i>, 
          Crawford plays a worker in a paper box factory in a Great Lakes industrial 
          town who rejects the local lug who loves her in order to rise socially 
          and economically from her own marsh mud to the glamour and wealth of 
          being a rich man's mistress in cosmopolitan New York. There are many 
          puns on rising in the film, often framed by elevator scenes with the 
          predictable &quot;Going up?&quot; Part of Crawford's morally monstrous 
          &quot;rise,&quot; however, involves seeing others married, while she 
          remains &quot;outside&quot; the social order of the church. Crawford 
          rises culturally too, from speaking an awkward midwest slang to singing 
          in several languages and ordering the proper wine at the proper temperature. 
          Her rise is marked cinematically by repeated frames of her pulling years 
          off a wall calendar, each time with an additional diamond bracelet-looking 
          increasingly like a manacle-on her wrist. <br>
          <br>
          While Zukofsky was hardly Gable either in looks or financial assets, 
          he did possess enormous cultural cache for Niedecker and one can't help 
          but see a similarity in their power dynamic, particularly in the way 
          she &quot;plays&quot; folk with him while distinguishing herself from 
          it. Both her visits to New York in the 1930s and her decisive return 
          to Black Hawk Island were acts of self-determination. Recognizing the 
          problematic of &quot;rising&quot; from marsh mud to culture, from folk 
          to avant-garde, and the subtle betrayals they imply, she embraces her 
          origin and identity as a poet who, among the &quot;dreadful&quot; folk 
          can possess her own possession.</font></p>
