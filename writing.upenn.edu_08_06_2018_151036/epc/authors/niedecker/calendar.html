        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lorine 
          Niedecker's &quot;Next Year or I fly my rounds, Tempestuous&quot; surfaced 
          during my recent probing of the Louis Zukofsky Collection at the Harry 
          Ransom Humanities Research Center, Austin, Texas. The poem was filed 
          with miscellaneous items of unidentified authorship. It is handwritten 
          on small pieces of paper pasted into a 27-page pocket calendar, 4&frac12; 
          x 3&frac34;&quot;, two weeks per page, the hole-punched pages held together 
          by a red velvet ribbon tied in a bow. Niedecker's pastings obscure &quot;The 
          Favorite Sunlit Road Calendar's&quot; own text, platitudes such as these-January 
          13-26: &quot;True bravery is/shown by performing/without witness what/one 
          might be capable/of doing before all the/world&quot;; Sept. 22-Oct. 
          5: &quot;To reach the port/of heaven, we must/sometimes sail with/the 
          wind and some-/times against it-but/we must sail and not/drift, nor 
          lie at anchor.&quot; The original text is <i>just</i> legible when held 
          to the light. Her spirited title inverts rather than pastes over the 
          calendar's title page. The poem makes no explicit reference to the pasted-over 
          homilies but the aleatoric nature of the palimpsest exudes parody.<br>
          <br>
          Given that the poem was held by Zukofsky and given his dating on the 
          back of the calendar-&quot;Xmas 1934&quot;-the poem was likely Niedecker's 
          gift to the poet whom she had now known in person for a full calendar 
          year. The gift looks forward confidently to another year of friendship 
          just as it recalls the past year. A pocket calendar, an intimate mnemonics. 
          But the poem is also a surrealist composition and an experiment in form. 
          The calendar itself is under siege. She teases the mnemonic device by 
          linking her non-sequitur and baffling lines to the predictable chronology 
          of a calendar. Earlier in 1934 she had written to Harriet Monroe about 
          her desire to &quot;discredit all journal method everywhere....&quot; 
          The same letter also talks of adding a section to &quot;Year Before 
          Last&quot; and of composing a piece called &quot;Year After Next.&quot; 
          (Neither of these works has survived.) Her challenge to the calendar-earlier 
          poems had challenged the dictionary-apparently extended to include &quot;Next 
          Year or I fly my rounds, Tempestuous.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Zukofsky showed the poem to his friends: in January 1936, he wrote to 
          Niedecker about William Carlos Williams' enthusiasm for the form of 
          &quot;last year's Xmas calendar&quot; and his interest in seeing it 
          published. Like some of her other surrealism, this poem posed obvious 
          difficulties for publication. She was, however, always keen to see her 
          work in print, and any misgivings one might have about publishing an 
          apparently private gift must contend with the ambition of her enterprise. 
          While much of the poem is written in the first person, in lines that 
          appear to be addressed to Zukofsky-&quot;Don't worry/about the comma,/darling&quot;-the 
          sleuthing reader is seldom rewarded. Privacy remains secure.<br>
          <br>
          The poem is a free and delighted collaboration of cogency and chance. 
          It is assured, worldly, funny, at ease with its liberties. There are 
          echoes of Dickinson, Zukofsky, and Niedecker's subsequent writings. 
          And it is closest in style to the two surrealist plays-&quot;President 
          of the Holding Company&quot; and &quot;Fancy Another Day Gone&quot;-that 
          were still to follow.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Next Year or I fly my rounds, Tempestuous&quot; is the second 
          recent discovery of a 'lost' Niedecker poem. In 1995, Burton Hatlen 
          found the five-page, eight-part poem, &quot;Progression,&quot; in the 
          Ezra Pound papers at the Beinecke Library. &quot;Progression&quot; is 
          dated January 6, 1934 although, according to a letter to Harriet Monroe, 
          a version of the poem was already complete by mid-1932. &quot;Next Year 
          or I fly my rounds, Tempestuous&quot; adds to the growing record of 
          Niedecker's early career.</font></p>
