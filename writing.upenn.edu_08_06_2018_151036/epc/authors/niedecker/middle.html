        <p>What is the effect of placing speech in a poem? What is the effect 
          of placing a poem in a collection of poems by other poets? These ordinary 
          cultural acts of displacement are taken for granted by most writers 
          and readers, but for the Objectivist poet Lorine Niedecker they represented 
          highly conscious acts alien to her everyday world. Although her fellow 
          Objectivists were marginalised by the literary world for much of their 
          careers, they mostly lived and worked within the metropolitan cultures 
          where their avant-garde poetry was read. She spent almost all her life 
          in rural Wisconsin in relative poverty, keeping her writing life quite 
          separate from her various working-class jobs and the local community. 
          This essay will read her poetry in terms of its relations with the poetic 
          avant-garde and the acts of displacement required by these connections. 
          Doing so helps make tangible the complexity of a poetic style that can 
          appear to dissolve meaning into a limpid clarity leaving nothing to 
          interpret, especially from the standpoint of the poetic avant-garde 
          that promulgated her work, and had during her lifetime a tendency to 
          make largely unquestioned assumptions about the universal transmissibility 
          of its forms of poetry. <br>
          <br>
          Lorine Niedecker was born in 1903 in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, and lived 
          in this rural area dominated by lakes and rivers until her death in 
          1970, with only a few spells away, mainly in Madison. She began writing 
          poetry in the thirties, visited New York where she met the young Objectivist 
          poet, Louis Zukofsky, and began a life-long correspondence with him, 
          which formed the basis of her relationship with the avant-garde network 
          of poets who became the publishers and readers of her poetry. After 
          a brief relationship with Zukofsky she returned to Wisconsin, and lived 
          a relatively solitary life devoted to an intensive poetic practice. 
          Unlike the jobs she took to support herself, there was &quot;no layoff/ 
          from this/ condensery&quot; (<i>Condensery </i>141). After early experiments 
          with surrealism and other modernist strategies, her poetry took as its 
          theme the rural culture and landscape, until toward the end of her career 
          she began to write about historical figures like Jefferson and Darwin. 
          Throughout her career she showed an extraordinary precision in her use 
          of sound in poetry. Only a few books of poetry were published in her 
          lifetime, and those by small presses, so her reputation depended on 
          the continuing support of a few people, notably the editor and poet, 
          Cid Corman, who published her in <i>Origin</i> and maintained a correspondence 
          with her in the latter part of her life. Even after her death her poetry 
          remained hard to obtain, and there is still no reliable complete edition 
          of her poetry available. Almost any brief account of the isolation and 
          poverty of Niedecker's life is likely to give a false impression however, 
          because as Rachel Blau Du Plessis and Jenny Penberthy have both persuasively 
          argued, Niedecker's life should not be read in terms of failure or exclusion<b><font size="2" color="#006666">1</font></b>. 
          Her isolation was a deliberate and creative choice that fostered her 
          poetry, whatever its other costs and deprivations.<br>
          <br>
          As a lifelong resident writer of Black Hawk Island, Niedecker lived 
          a long way from any metropolitan or avant-garde culture, yet she was 
          very aware of how her world might look from outside. During the thirties 
          she was employed by the WPA as a research editor on the guide to Wisconsin, 
          for which she would have had to learn some of the skills of the folklorist 
          to record local idioms and anecdotes that could typify a regional culture, 
          and so became that uneasy figure the participant observer. Her relation 
          to advanced literary culture was oddly similar, although in this case 
          she was more observer than participant. The art world was familiar, 
          and yet apart, because contact with it depended largely on one man, 
          Zukofsky, of whose metropolitan art world she had little first-hand 
          experience. Publishing a poem meant alienating it even further from 
          the place and the people where she lived, few of whom even knew she 
          wrote, and placing it within the network of avant-garde publishing. 
          Her poetry's continuance depended upon a small discerning network of 
          editors who recognised the value of her poetry, and would publish it, 
          mostly in magazines, and only rarely in books or anthologies. Her work 
          is still closely identified with certain small presses. The social and 
          subjective distance that her poems travelled would have made her aware 
          of the way this network could take control not only of the general significance 
          of her poetry, but of the very meanings of poems themselves. Her emphasis 
          on &quot;local reality, a fusion of past and personal&quot; (Caddel 
          282) is in part a poetic strategy for revealing the implications of 
          such necessary appropriation. <br>
          <br>
          What happens when these seemingly fundamental practices, making speech 
          into poems, and placing poems amongst the work of other poets, become 
          self-conscious, awkward and distancing rather than taken for granted? 
          The clarities, themes, address, and intertextualities of Niedecker's 
          poetry insinuate suprising local critiques of such apparently unquestionable 
          practices, and so what might have been merely a phenomenologically astute 
          poetry of place becomes something much more unusual. The tensions between 
          localism and internationalism in much twentieth century American poetry 
          are put to work in Niedecker's poetry to create a new poetics of cultural 
          transmission.<br>
          <br>
          She could have seen a pointed, instructive example of these tensions 
          when soon after the publication of her first book, <i>New Goose</i>, 
          in 1946, Louis Zukofsky chose one of her very short poems, &quot;There's 
          a Better Shine&quot;, for his didactic anthology <i>A Test of Poetry</i> 
          (1948), which places a wide range of old and new English poetry into 
          short sets for the purposes of contrast and comparison. In its entirety 
          her poem reads: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p> There's a better shine<br>
              on the pendulum<br>
              than is on my hair<br>
              and many times<br>
              * * * *<br>
              I've seen it there. (<i>Test of Poetry</i> 41)</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
          The diacritical stars are an integral part of the poem at several levels, 
          indicating a pause for breath and a break in thought, representing a 
          measure of elapsed time, and forming an iconic image of the beats of 
          a pendulum. This poem's elegant concision, musical control, innovative 
          use of punctuation, and apparent simplicity of theme, typify much of 
          Niedecker's later work. A discussion of the wider significance of its 
          unobtrusive meditation (one wants to say &quot;reflection&quot; until 
          one realises that this is a pun which the poem itself implies) on the 
          relationship between self-image, time and perceptual acts of mediation 
          between subject and object, could review the history of aesthetic argument 
          since Romanticism. Zukofsky pointed the poem in a different direction. 
          He placed this poem in his anthology in such a context that its meaning 
          could be bent into quite another shape too, and in doing so, was acting 
          in accordance with his own acute sense of the need to recognise the 
          genealogical, ideological, and formalist challenges to the value of 
          one's own poetry. In an essay for <i>Poetry</i> written in 1946, he 
          explains that to be a poet means that every poem or potential poem of 
          one's own is placed alongside all the other poems of the past: &quot;The 
          poet may visibly stop writing, but secretly measures himself against 
          each word of poetry ever written. Furthermore....he thinks of others 
          who have lived, live, and will live to say the things he cannot say 
          for the time being&quot; (<i>Prepositions</i> 11). This anxious belief 
          that the poet is engaged in some transhistoric poetry competition depends 
          on the unexplored assumption that poetry is a transferable utterance. 
          A poem begins as a wordless urgency to which the poet is trying to give 
          voice, possibly helped by the utterances of earlier poems, and sometimes 
          hindered by incapacity, while anxious that other poets will develop 
          this capacity first, and so be able to say what the poet had hoped to 
          claim originality for. The material of the poem can move freely from 
          one location or moment to another, and does not inhere in one intersubjective 
          network from where it could only be wrenched away at the risk of an 
          attenuation of significance. His anthology offered a tangible demonstration 
          of this belief in the transferability of poetry across a transhistoric 
          and international network of poetic value.<br>
          <br>
          Recontextualisation is the strategic device chosen to make readers see 
          the poems and extracts afresh, but its effect on Niedecker's poem is 
          much more than an act of editorial defamiliarisation. It transforms 
          a poem that reflects upon self-consciousness and time into a poem which 
          seems to confirm, from the mouth of a woman poet, that women are rightly 
          depicted as dangerously seductive creatures of passion by the male poetic 
          tradition. This is a reading with special resonance given Zukofsky's 
          own history of relations with Niedecker.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;There's a better shine&quot; is displayed at the end of a column 
          of three other poems by Keats, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and Shakespeare, 
          an exalted company of men. This balance of past and present is typical 
          of <i>A Test of Poetry</i>, which is predominantly made up of seventeenth 
          century verse, with some nineteenth century and a few contemporary poets 
          such as Charles Reznikoff, Williams Carlos Williams and Louis Zukofsky 
          himself. Contemporary poems are therefore placed in a particular literary 
          history that derives particularly from modernist preoccupations. The 
          poems in Niedecker's group appear anonymously with a series of labels, 
          23a-23d, that refer to a key at the back, from which we also learn that 
          this group appears under the rubric &quot;recurrence&quot;. Recurrence 
          is unlikely to be a reader's first association, given the obviousness 
          of two other themes, women and clarity, whose salience is encouraged 
          by the interpretative licence of anonymity and the lack of immediately 
          discernible categorisation. The delayed effect of the knowledge of authorship, 
          especially awareness that the last poem is by a woman, then actually 
          plays into the expectations the group generates poem by poem. <br>
          <br>
          The set begins with a tantalisingly brief phrase. Keats's &quot;Ode 
          to Autumn&quot; is represented in minimalist fashion by just three words, 
          &quot;hedge-crickets sing&quot;, an allusion to the final celebrations 
          of nature before the death of the year. In the poem, autumn is a &quot;close 
          bosom-friend of the maturing sun&quot;, a personified figure whose gender 
          is not identified, but closely associated with many feminine qualities, 
          such as plumpness and ripeness, and is also a pastoral figure, the personification 
          of a landscape about to be transformed into the wintry absence of feminising 
          presence. The hedge-crickets could be minor poets singing the imminent 
          demise of mature sensuality. In the next extract, Lord Herbert of Cherbury 
          asks Love to divide the properties of glass between himself and the 
          woman he loves so that there will be &quot;clearness for me, frailty 
          for her&quot; (the poem is called &quot;In a Glass-Window for Inconstancy&quot;). 
          The request is full of delightful ironies, since the apparent impossibility 
          of separating these qualities of glass could lead to the inference that 
          the man's clarity of thought may itself fracture, or alternatively suggest 
          that love will always be a mix of rationality and passion, for men as 
          well as women. Whatever its ironies however, the poem's ground is a 
          strongly gendered division of the faculties into reason and emotion. 
          This stereotypical rift is picked up even more strongly in the next 
          extract from Shakespeare's <i>Pericles</i>: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><br>
              Fair glass of light, I love you, and could still,<br>
              Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:<br>
              But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt;<br>
              For he's no man on whom perfections wait<br>
              That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate. <br>
              You are a fair viol and your sense the strings,<br>
              Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,<br>
              Would draw heaven down and all the gods, to hearken,<br>
              But being play'd upon before your time,<br>
              Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.(<i>Test of Poetry</i> 41)</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
          Pericles makes this aside when he realises that Antiochus and Antiochus's 
          daughter are lovers and the king has no intention of letting Pericles 
          or anyone else marry her. By juxtaposing these allusions to perverse 
          love with Niedecker's poem, Zukofsky makes the passage say things he 
          perhaps cannot, both of the more general kind his essay endorsed, and 
          the most intimate. He himself had had an affair with Niedecker that 
          was premature and not &quot;lawful&quot;, at least in the religous sense. 
          Whether consciously, or more likely, unconsciously, he has chosen a 
          passage that would say what he feels about what had happened, and in 
          doing so also takes over its gender assumptions as if to justify his 
          attitude. Women are instruments upon which men make music, not makers 
          of music themselves. With the reinforcement of the two previous extracts 
          this becomes a powerful coded statement in sharp tension with the evidence 
          of a woman making music in the final extract.<br>
          <br>
          The <i>Pericles</i> passage ends on the word &quot;chime&quot;, which 
          is then echoed both by the sound of the word &quot;shine&quot; and the 
          image of the pendulum in Niedecker's lyric. The clever use in the last 
          line of a pronoun whose antecedent is ambiguous, and the visual pun 
          on the movement of the pendulum that represents time passing, reframe 
          the appealing self-deprecating admission of the poet's lack of beauty. 
          Instead of simply an amusing, idiomatic exaggeration of drabness, the 
          poem becomes a meditation on the reflexivity of identity over time. 
          By placing Niedecker's poem at the end of this set of poems, Zukofsky 
          overshadows such interpretations, first by creating a private historical 
          relevance projected as the motivation for his selection, which makes 
          her poem into an admission of complicity with perverse desire, and then, 
          through its placement as a late example of a topos with a long history, 
          into an avowal of female narcissism that endorses the poetic tradition. 
          For the few readers who knew of Zukofsky's relations with Niedecker, 
          this sequence, far from universalising their poetic relevance, would 
          have actually demonstrated that the metropolitant art world could be 
          a highly local place. <br>
          <br>
          The sequence also produces another, potentially misogynistic, semantic 
          drama about poetic vocation. The derogatory idea of woman as a mere 
          instrument for the generation of music by a skilled male creator, is 
          reinforced by this thematisation of male clarity, since clarity was 
          a guiding preoccupation of the Objectivist nexus, and a concern of Niedecker 
          herself, although less explicitly so. To understand how this drama is 
          constructed, it is necessary to consider the importance of the concept 
          of clarity for Objectivist poetics.<br>

          The vehemence of this assertion is a tacit recognition of the difficulties 
          of attaining clarity, both according to his theories of the relation 
          between language and the world, and in his poetry, which often presents 
          manifest difficulties, conceptual and syntactic, to the reader. Zukofsky 
          too, aspired to clarity as an ideal that his poetry might only gesture 
          at. The belief that rationality depends as much upon visualisation and 
          sound, as it does upon words, which he attributes to Wittgenstein, C.S. 
          Pierce and of course Spinoza, leads him to an even stronger celebration 
          of clarity: &quot;the eye cannot look so that it cannot look. The wholeness 
          it sees in looking is its inexpressible ethics&quot; (<i>Bottom</i> 
          89). To lack the &quot;clearness&quot; of glass, or to be a &quot;fair 
          glass of light&quot; that is corrupted within, is to lack an ethics 
          entirely. Perhaps even to admit that the &quot;wholeness&quot; one sees 
          when looking at oneself in a simultaneous act of visual and cognitive 
          self-reflection is also dependent on a concern with the success of one's 
          feminine appearance, is an act of ethical weakness. By placing Niedecker's 
          poem in such company, the anthology makes possible a reading of her 
          poem that questions whether a woman can ever be a poet, particularly 
          a poet striving for the highest ideals of claritas, like the Objectivists.<br>
          <br>
          Tempting as it is to imagine Niedecker decoding these meanings and taking 
          them to heart, this is not the conclusion we can draw from the existing 
          evidence. We don't know that Niedecker ever consciously made any of 
          these connexions, nor whether she registered the fact that she and Marianne 
          Moore were the only women poets in the collection. She went on liking 
          &quot;There's a better shine&quot;, and referred to it as one of her 
          five best poems (along with &quot;Old man who seined&quot;, &quot;Paul&quot;, 
          &quot;I rose from marsh mud&quot;, and &quot;The clothesline post is 
          set&quot;) in a letter to Cid Corman in 1960 (Faranda 24), so Zukofsky's 
          use of it doesn't appear to have dimmed her attachment to it, and there 
          is no evidence that the anthology itself affected her in any way. We 
          cannot treat it as a trauma that generated a subsequent reaction formation 
          in her poetics. What we can say is that throughout her career she was 
          presented with plenty of evidence of the way in which the Objectivist 
          version of avant-garde ideals could make poems speak in new ways, even 
          running counter to one's aims, by treating poems as part of an international, 
          transtemporal language of poets, irregardless of their initial &quot;webbing 
          of relations&quot; (DuPlessis in Penberthy, <i>Lorine Niedecker</i>109) 
          to a locality of readers and history. <i>A Test of Poetry</i> is simply 
          an example that particularly rewards a critical archeology looking for 
          enduring traces of such transformations. The question then is whether 
          her poetry offers any challenge to, and investigation of, such appropriation. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Niedecker was certainly chary of the distortions produced by the contextualisation 
          of poetry by school or group. Near the end of her career there are distinct 
          signs in the letters that she wanted to distance herself from Objectivism, 
          notably concerning the Objectivist issue of <i>Contemporary Literature</i> 
          because it seemed to encourage a superficial set of relationships between 
          poets: &quot;there is the talking about each other's poetry that bothers 
          me a little....it's literary criticism but all the same a little also 
          like gossip!&quot; )Faranda 193). In a letter to Gail Roub, one of the 
          few people outside the avant-garde network she could discuss poetry 
          with, she says she is &quot;much taken up with how to define a way of 
          writing poetry which is not Imagist nor Objectivist fundamentally nor 
          Surrealism alone&quot; (Faranda 9). This negative poetics leads her 
          to a redefinition that has a phenomenological ring to it as it tries 
          to separate itself from simple clarity. &quot;The basis is direct and 
          clear---what has been seen or heard etc...--but something gets in, overlays 
          all that to make a state of consciousness [...] I used to feel that 
          I was goofing off unless I held only to the hard, clear image, the thing 
          you could put your hand on but now I dare do this reflection&quot;. 
          Instead of a choice between clarity and frailty, the choice is between 
          mere perceptual clarity and the complexities of reflective consciousness. 
          Looking in the pendulum is an act of daring.<br>
          <br>
          Although she lacked the range of opportunity available to even a poet 
          as marginalised as Zukofsky, Niedecker was quite capable of intervening 
          in the politics of recontextualisation herself, within the limited fields 
          offered to her, as a discussion of George Oppen in one of her letters 
          reveals. In this letter she seems suprisingly rude about Oppen, describing 
          him as a latter-day grasshopper, as if obliquely recalling those &quot;hedge-cricket&quot; 
          poets from Keats, and thereby acknowledging Zukofsky's other acts of 
          poetic displacement. It is also an example of just how the nexus could 
          represent itself through the transfer of images and phrases. &quot;George 
          Oppen---yes, there's something intriguing there. However, there are 
          times I've felt he's down in the grass as an insect (singing from his 
          knees), all angular, a kind of constipated grasshopper&quot; (Letter 
          to Corman Jan 30, 1968 [Faranda 149]). Almost certainly she would have 
          had in mind his most recent book<i> This In Which</i>, and perhaps was 
          conflating images from the poems &quot;Seated Man&quot; and &quot;The 
          Occurrences&quot;. In the first he imagines a man alienated from the 
          everyday world by his experience of war---</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p> <br>
              The man is old and---<br>
              Out of scale</p>
            <p> Sitting in the rank grass. (<i>Collected Poems</i> 108)</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
          ---an experience which the poem goes on to equate in Whitmanic fashion 
          with the world. Grass in &quot;The Occurrences&quot; is a trope which 
          makes a Romantic appeal to the vitality of living things in the shadow 
          of the sun &quot;In which the bugs crawl/ At the roots of the grass&quot; 
          (126). It is a place which might teach even God and certainly any father 
          conscious of his minimal role in the creation of human beings, about 
          the more fundamental male act of creation, &quot;the creating/ Now that 
          tremendous/ plunge&quot;, which makes temporality about as phallic as 
          possible, and then projects it as an implicit poetic ideal. This is 
          a polar opposite to the restrained, openly gendered awareness of temporality 
          in Niedecker's pendulum poem.<br>
          <br>
          Both Oppen and Niedecker write with an awareness of one of the best 
          known Objectivist poems, Zukofsky's &quot;&quot;Mantis&quot;&quot; (<i>All</i> 
          73), in which the praying mantis lost in the hostile urban landscape 
          of the subway stone evokes the plight of the poor. The highly formal 
          version of the sestina Zukofsky used provoked in turn a second companion 
          poem &quot;&quot;Mantis,&quot; An Interpretation&quot; (74), a defense 
          of the poetical language of the first. The quotation marks in which 
          the insect's name is set are explained in this second poem as a reminder 
          that to turn a human being into a symbolic insect may violate their 
          humanity (78). Niedecker's remark about Oppen could be taken to mean 
          that alongside Zukofsky's mantis, Oppen is merely a grasshopper, and 
          more significantly, to imply that what she does to Oppen, turn a human 
          being into an symbolic insect, he does to his urban denizens. But even 
          Zukofsky comes close to admitting that he is doing this, saying at the 
          end of the poem that the poor are a more constant memory than the poetic 
          tradition, represented by the phrase &quot;com' huom pietra sott' erba&quot;. 
          (80). &quot;&quot;Mantis&quot;&quot; imagines the flourishing mantis 
          hiding on a stone in the grass in its proper habitat, and still finding 
          a base in the inhospitable stone architecture of the subway, where it 
          preys symbolically on human life. (74). Pity, disgust, and economic 
          cannibalism are so hopelessly entwined in the world depicted in the 
          formal sestina that the following &quot;interpretation&quot; becomes 
          a near-admission of failure in the conviction that it is nothing but 
          a chaos within attempted order (79). <br>
          <br>
          The poem succeeding &quot;Seated Man&quot; in Oppen's <i>Collected Poems</i>, 
          &quot;Street&quot;, also considers poverty, but in a manner which contrasts 
          with both Zukofsky and especially Niedecker. Indeed it makes one aware 
          that even the idea that there is an underclass of people who could be 
          designated the &quot;poor&quot; rarely surfaces in her poetry despite 
          the evident poverty of her community. Oppen steps away from the people 
          whose impoverished lives are easily visible on the street with an apodictic 
          gesture, &quot;Ah these are the poor&quot;, whose exclamatory particle 
          expresses the moment of inarticulate sympathetic recognition when attention 
          registers their existence and his own distance from them. Furthermore, 
          the emphatic interjection somewhat showily demonstrates a deep feeling 
          that resists language, for which reason modern poets have been wary 
          of its possibly presumptuous Romantic claim to such inner depths (Prynne). 
          The poem stumbles, with an engaging honesty, through a series of responses 
          that might well have irritated someone like Niedecker. By saying &quot;I 
          want// An end of poverty/ As much as anyone&quot;, he risks dismissing 
          the culture of the dispossessed along with their economic condition, 
          and when he arrives at a climactic image of the human cost of poverty, 
          the effect is compromised by his readiness to sentimentalise ethical 
          violation as a fallen woman:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><br>
              It is terrible to see the children,</p>
            <p> The righteous little girls;<br>
              So good, they expect to be so good... [ellipses in original] (<i>Collected 
              Poems</i> 109). <br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The avant-garde poet is out of place, reduced for a moment to the semantic 
          void of a phatic interjection, when he finds himself with the people 
          Niedecker called the &quot;folk&quot;. She herself was poor, and frequently 
          referred to the folk as both spring and swamp for her ambitions, but 
          she would never have been so willing to speculate whether these anonymous 
          girls could grow up into some kind of goodness, nor would she have allowed 
          herself such a distancing emphatical sigh, understanding from the inside 
          as she did that ethics might vary according to one's class perspective. 
          Sympathy like Oppen's might be more conservative than its apparent concern 
          for the children's future would suggest.<br>
          <br>
          Could Oppen's poetry also be acting as a screen memory for Zukofsky's 
          poem from the thirties? At the beginning of the letter which morphs 
          Oppen into an insect, Niedecker refers to a poem about a dragonfly she 
          had recently sent to Corman:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <pre>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">           Smile
                to see the lake
                     lay
                the still sky
           And
                out for an easy
                     make
                the dragonfly. (<i>Granite Pail</i> 61)</font></pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
          This subtle poem offers the sexualised metaphor of the landscape in 
          an ironic frame that invites the reader to both enjoy the slight absurdity 
          of this naughty trope, and to see its explanatory power, before teasing 
          the reader with a change of scale from lake to dragonfly. It too is 
          out for conquest, although whether as mate or hunter is deliberately 
          ambiguous, as if to confirm the universality of sex. Mantis, grasshopper 
          and dragonfly---the subtle permutations on these almost heraldic insects 
          signify another distinction. The dragonfly is described in terms that 
          derive from &quot;folk speech&quot;, a local humour about the landscape 
          and its fauna that reveals the preoccupations of the indigenous people 
          as much as the character of the place. <br>
          <br>
          Placing everyday folk speech in poetry was something else that divided 
          Niedecker from Oppen. Her momentary impatience with Oppen may also have 
          had roots in her awareness of his criticism of poets who attempted to 
          &quot;reproduce common speech&quot; in poetry. Such practices smacked 
          of a suspect &quot;populism&quot; to Oppen. Asked by an interviewer 
          what he meant by populism he refers to the poem &quot;The red wheelbarrow&quot;, 
          saying that Williams appears to believe in &quot;the greater reality 
          of certain kinds of objects than of others&quot; (Contemporary Literature 
          167), citing the wheelbarrow and chickens as an example. In the wider 
          context of such differences between the Objectivists, it is as if Niedecker 
          is saying that Oppen approaches American numerousness, the grass, with 
          a predatory outsider's objectivity that results in a droning poetry's 
          automatism of sound (the singing grasshopper that recalls Keats' hedge-crickets 
          perhaps). His willingness to see the American masses as grass resembles 
          the transformation of the dragonfly into a philandering male by the 
          initial playful trope in its attempt to grasp the beauty and interpenetration 
          of sky and water. Local playfulness redeems the imposition, whereas 
          the greening of the people in Oppen's tropes appears to confirm a metropolitan 
          aesthetic superiority. It turns out therefore that Niedecker herself 
          is adept at this business of intertextuality and recontextualisation, 
          making arguments with layers of allusions to the work of the poets she 
          knew and read. She can triangulate precisely her shared preoccupations 
          about the poet's relation to society, the use of people and the natural 
          world as symbols, and the pragmatics of their discourse, and in doing 
          so measure her differences from her Objectivist associates Zukofsky 
          and Oppen. <br>
          <br>
          In no area did they differ as much as on the question of folk speech 
          and its place in poetry. Niedecker's commitment to what she called the 
          &quot;folk&quot; led to a different sense of career, a curious resistance 
          to publicly reading her poetry, and an active interest in folklore that 
          creates a radically innovative form of poetry. Despite her unofficial 
          membership of the Objectivist nexus, Niedecker's own position in relation 
          to the avant-garde is unusual. Although she was published by some of 
          the most prestigious avant-garde poetry presses, she lived more outside 
          the urban centres of radical literary practice than almost any other 
          poet one can think of. She never became a professional writer or teacher 
          as almost all of her contemporaries did, and this refusal to professionalise 
          her poetry was both an economic and an aesthetic decision, for since 
          the late nineteenth century aestheticism has helped provide an ideology 
          for the emergence of professionalism in America, with its claims to 
          special expertise. By rejecting professionalism she was also rejecting 
          the longstanding claim that the work of literary practitioners could 
          evince a special kind of expertise or &quot;cultural knowledge&quot; 
          and its accompanying role of teacher to initiates (Freedman 55), which 
          is so evident in a text like <i>A Test of Poetry.</i> Her own employments 
          were not career jobs, and her everyday life put her entirely outside 
          even the romantic models of the outsider who is able to use the position 
          as a cultural position ahead of the more conformist artists who lag 
          behind the scouts of the avant-garde. She simply wasn't outside in the 
          sense that other poets and novelists who lived on the margins have been. 
          She was inside the life-world where she was born despite her own differences 
          and distances from it which made her relations to the locality sometimes 
          uncomfortable. <br>
          <br>
          Her refusal to tour and give public readings of her poetry even extended 
          to her resistance to the idea of recording herself on tape. Cid Corman 
          tried to record her, but the result was a failure because she would 
          not project her verse in the impersonal manner required (&quot;I fell 
          over one of the stanzas and nearly squashed it&quot;) as she explained 
          in this letter to Kenneth Cox written November 23, 1970: <br>

        <p><br>
          She wants an aural reception but doesn't want an oral means of creating 
          it. As she explained to her friends the Roubs afterwards, in what was 
          probably her last letter, &quot;a person conscious of a listening audience 
          would write just a tiny bit differently&quot; (Faranda 241). Her reference 
          to Beethoven betrays her awareness of the apparent contradiction of 
          what she is saying. A composer denied the opportunity to hear his own 
          music except in the auditory imagination is in a sorry state, and seems 
          a poor parallel for what she wants. Her examples are perhaps at first 
          sight unconvincing, because the written text is also ambiguous, but 
          in both examples what she highlights is the problem of what philosophers 
          call &quot;implicature&quot; (Grice), the necessity for the auditor 
          to decide what is the probable shape and meaning of the word. In the 
          second case she imagines being able to interject an aside, in other 
          words to create a momentary intersubjective relation in which its relevance 
          will be made apparent. In the first she is imagining the lack of such 
          an intersubjective world for the utterance, so that its significance 
          goes begging. She describes it as a problem created by the translation 
          of poem from text to speech, but it is really a problem created by her 
          loss of control over the intersubjectivities within which her poetry 
          is located. Niedecker's idea of the silence of the reader waiting to 
          be filled is evocative because it underlines the importance of sound 
          to her poetry, and her lack of the recognition onto which poets can 
          project relations between poem and reader from within the poem itself. 
          In a letter she wrote to Cid Corman three years earlier on May 3, 1967, 
          she described the audience at a reading as an audience &quot;mixed and 
          nerve-crossed...somewhat inattentive&quot;, and said she would only 
          be able to manage if she could find a way that &quot;the silence could 
          be governed among the people&quot; (Faranda 121). The silence is an 
          absence of dialogue, of conversation, due to the distance between poet 
          and reader. Her poem begins there, with this silence, this absence of 
          intersubjectivity, rather than immediately appealing to the universalising 
          languages and frameworks of modern art and the avant-garde. This is 
          why in the letter to Corman she is explicit about the intimate scale 
          of the intersubjectivity with which her poetry aims to work: &quot;Poems 
          are for one person to another, spoken thus, or read silently&quot;. 
          This is poetry conceived within a network of local relationships with 
          a known history, a poetry that refuses the blandishments that promise 
          it can be placed anywhere in public culture without loss, and does not 
          believe that it can always put other people's thoughts into words without 
          attenuation. <br>
          <br>
          Niedecker's willingness to describe the foundation of her poetry as 
          a &quot;folk base&quot; stems from this resistance to the idea that 
          poetry should be an infinitely transmissible utterance, and helps explain 
          why she might think of herself as located within another quite different 
          literary tradition to that of Objectivism, and even come to believe 
          that this was what made her work distinctive. &quot;I probably show 
          a folk base and even LZ knew it many years ago, and that so far as I 
          see it might actually be my only claim to any difference between most 
          poets and meself&quot;, she wrote to Jonathan Williams in August 1970 
          (Penberthy 4). &quot;Most poets&quot; are presumably the poets she read 
          in magazines like Origin. The self-conscious emphasis on her folksiness 
          created by the idiomatic spelling of the last word of this sentence 
          gives some ground for Jenny Penberthy's interpretation of this and other 
          similar statements as typical of a deceptive self-deprecation that has 
          helped maintain the image of Lorine Niedecker as someone to be remembered 
          largely for &quot;her folk poetry and her poems of place&quot; (Penberthy, 
          <i>Niedecker Correspondence</i> 4). Occasional references to the folk 
          in her letters and poems suggest that she was conscious of this element 
          long before she wrote to Jonathan Williams. She calls Group III of the 
          poems in &quot;For Paul&quot;, &quot;the folk group, the American group&quot;, 
          acknowleding the way she uses a deliberate mix of folk humour and avant-garde 
          technique. The result is a mixture of poetic styles which includes &quot;What 
          horror to wake at night&quot; with its painful refrain &quot;I've spent 
          my life on nothing&quot;, the mock ballad &quot;Jesse James and his 
          brother Frank&quot;, and the short poem about the other James brothers, 
          &quot;May you have lumps in your mashed potatoes&quot;. This latter 
          poem juxtaposes an anecdote from the childhood of Henry and William 
          James, with Henry's consoling letter to Grace Norton (of July 28, 1883), 
          in which he extols the &quot;illimitable&quot; power of consciousness 
          and counsels her not to &quot;melt too much into the universe but be 
          solid and dense and fixed&quot; as she is able, in other words, to be 
          a lump in the mashed potato of the universe. The humour of the absurd 
          parallel between the two sets of James brothers created by juxtaposing 
          these two poems, brings the great writers back from the thin air of 
          transcendental concerns to an everyday domestic world of cooked vegetables. 
          The opening line is actually a mock curse uttered by the brothers &quot;to 
          those who stood up to them in argu/ ment&quot; (<i>Condensery</i> 61). 
          Neidecker's poem could be asking what happens when a reader stands up 
          to the argument made by Henry James in the letter to Norton, or to the 
          similar themes to be found elsewhere in his writing.<br>
          <br>
          Penberthy also cites another more complex reference to the folk element 
          in Niedecker's poems in the sequence &quot;For Paul&quot;, which Niedecker 
          made when a selection was published in <i>The New Mexico Quarterly Review</i>. 
          Good poetry, she says, is the &quot;outcome of experimentation with 
          subconscious and with folk---all good poetry must contain elements of 
          both or stems from them---plus the rational, organizational force&quot;, 
          and Penberthy comments: &quot;Her use of 'folk' refers, I suspect, to 
          folk speech, the common currency of routine interactions&quot; (<i>Niedecker 
          Correspondence</i> 60). This could make Niedecker sound very like William 
          Carlos Williams, who also valued ordinary speech highly as a source 
          for his work. In the preface to <i>The Wedge</i> (1944) he said that 
          a poem is made individual by the specificity of &quot;the character 
          of the speech from which it arises&quot; (<i>Collected Poems</i> 2: 
          54). This meant letting the syntax and vocabulary alone during the process 
          of arranging them into a composition: &quot;When a man makes a poem, 
          makes it, mind you, he takes words as he finds them interrelated about 
          him and composes them---without distortion which would mar their exact 
          significances---into an intense expression of his perceptions and ardors 
          that they may constitute a revelation in the speech that he uses&quot;. 
          Although Williams stresses that found speech or folk idioms must not 
          be tampered with as they are carefully placed within the structure of 
          the poem, he is perfectly willing to impose a new framing syntax around 
          them, so that now they become a revelation of the poet's own perceptions 
          and desires, just as Zukofsky did in <i>A Test of Poetry</i>. Williams, 
          one might say, developing Penberthy's metaphor further, takes the currency 
          of speech out of circulation and celebrates its value independently 
          of the exchange represented by its &quot;interrelations&quot;. Its revelation 
          is a result of putting it on display in the poem. Niedecker's practice 
          is oriented in a reverse direction. Instead of producing a revelation 
          from this withdrawal from circulation she actually intensifies the poem's 
          immersion in those same &quot;routine interactions&quot;. <br>
          <br>
          Many of Williams's poems certainly acknowledge their source in such 
          ordinary relations. His poem &quot;This is just to say&quot; holds up 
          for scrutiny an extremely familar act of communication, the written 
          note to an absent intimate (<i>Collected Poems</i> 1: 372). The poem 
          uses the metalinguistic opening line knowingly, for this apparent kitchen 
          note is not just an occasion to say something about plums, this is now 
          also a poem, which will have what Niedecker described in Zukofsky's 
          poetry in a letter from 1951, &quot;a supersense, not meaning in the 
          ordinary sense&quot; (Penberthy, <i>Niedecker Correspondence</i> 175). 
          It works very similarly to some of Niedecker's, except that the disingenuous 
          opening disavowal signals to the knowing reader in a way that withdraws 
          the poem from its immediate intersubjective drama, and diverts attention 
          away from its traces, through a mutual recognition of an aesthetic value 
          that overrides any unsubsumable particularities. Niedecker's appeal 
          to the &quot;folk base&quot; as the element which makes her poetry most 
          innovative takes her poems in a different direction. Her poetry challenges 
          the way avant-garde poetry is ordinarily read, by demanding an alteration 
          in the stance taken in the process of reception.<br>
          <br>
          Is it sufficient to locate this folk element of her poetry in her interest 
          in reproducing everyday idioms? The contrast with Williams suggests 
          that more is involved. One way of clarifying its significance for her 
          work would be to trace the vicissitudes of this now largely defunct 
          term, which earlier in the twentieth century enjoyed widespread credibility, 
          both in academic studies and in politics. I can only sketch this history 
          here. For the many immigrants from Germany to the northern states, the 
          idea of the &quot;volk&quot; was a powerful, evocative image of immemorial 
          tradition in proximity with the land which had been at best disrupted, 
          and for many simply lost, by immigration. Back in Germany it came to 
          have a more sinister appeal as part of the new code of Aryan nationalism 
          under National Socialism. Because of this taint, the term was dropped 
          by socialists in the thirties in favour of other terms like &quot;the 
          masses&quot;, itself a concept which socialists after the war also came 
          to mistrust. Niedecker's adoption of the term folk needs to be understood 
          within this political history. When she refers to working class people 
          like those at the print shop where she worked as &quot;the folk from 
          whom all poetry flows/ and dreadfully much else&quot; (<i>Granite Pail</i> 
          21), she does not utter a sigh like Oppen, nor does she give way to 
          romantic populism. As the ambivalence of these lines indicates, she 
          oscillated between immersion and alienation from the local community, 
          and the term &quot;folk&quot; itself is a measure of this instability. 
          <br>
          <br>
          From her reading, politics, possibly her college studies, and certainly 
          from her WPA work, she must have been aware of other more anthropological 
          uses of the term &quot;folk&quot; which register the doubleness of participant 
          observation amongst a people that are also &quot;one's own&quot;. Academic 
          study of folk culture, especially dance, song and poetry which had apparently 
          survived over long periods of time by oral transmission amongst ordinary 
          people, was a long established field by the time she became a poet herself, 
          and it was usually considered then to be the field most appropriate 
          for those interested in features of rural or pre-modern Western culture. 
          Another better known writer of the twenties and thirties turned to folklore 
          studies for similar reasons to Niedecker. Zora Neale Hurston studied 
          anthropology with Franz Boas in order to be able to research her own 
          African-American culture, and in doing so encountered many similar contradictions 
          to Lorine Niedecker. Hurston collected folk tales and other examples 
          of black American speech in the Florida where she was born, and used 
          the material for both documentary and fiction. She said that &quot;folklore 
          is the arts of the people before they find out that there is such a 
          thing as art...folklore does not belong to any special area, time, nor 
          people...It is the boiled down juice of human living&quot; (quoted in 
          Johnson 161). Hence culture is a form of knowledge: &quot;culture is 
          a forced march on the near and the obvious....The intelligent mind uses 
          up a great part of its lifespan trying to awaken its consciousness sufficiently 
          to comprehend that which is plainly there before it&quot;. Barbara Johnson, 
          who cites these comments on folklore, concludes that Hurston's aim in 
          her novel <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> was to use her knowledge 
          of folklore to challenge the &quot;seduction of a universal language 
          through a progressive de-universalization that ends in the exclusion 
          of the very protagonist herself&quot; (172).<br>
          <br>
          Niedecker also used such ideas about folklore to challenge the universalization 
          implicit in the internationalised languages of modernity, by positioning 
          herself as much as a folklorist as one of the folk, even though she 
          had only a limited academic training compared to Hurston. Her main experience 
          of folklore studies would have been as part of the WPA project to write 
          the guide for Wisconsin. <i>Wisconsin: A Guide to the Badger State</i>, 
          is typical in the way it plays the folklorist with a sometimes sentimental 
          or humorous twist. It tries to epitomise the culture of the town of 
          Peppin with this example of folk speech: &quot;Their speech draws many 
          images from the great river. Seeing a drunken man staggering up the 
          street in early spring, an idler remarks, 'He's sure goin' up the river' 
          and his crony replies, 'Yep, he's gonna burn all the ice out of Lake 
          Pepin'&quot; (436). These WPA guides had ethnographic pretensions beyond 
          mere description of architecture, topography and history, although in 
          the eyes of professionals the result was a &quot;relative failure&quot; 
          because the amateurs had &quot;little idea as to what they were seeking&quot; 
          (Thompson 256). Although the results of such a survey of the states 
          might disappoint professionals, for a poet like Niedecker this undertheorised 
          research into the way people might draw images from their locality as 
          a means of creating local knowledge, was an invaluable training for 
          the writing of poetry, and the WPA project could be called her department 
          of anthropology. <br>
          <br>
          When Niedecker refers to the source of a poem as &quot;folk speech&quot;, 
          she is saying more than that the words are those of a local person. 
          She could have said the speech was working class, or idiomatic, or even 
          old-fashioned and quaint. Instead she invokes a way of considering communities 
          and their history which has considerable implications for what she is 
          trying to achieve in her poems. Consider this poem:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><br>
              <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The museum man!<br>
              I wish he'd take Pa's spitbox!<br>
              I'm going to take that spitbox out<br>
              and bury it in the ground<br>
              and put a stone on top.<br>
              Because without that stone on top<br>
              it would come back. (<i>Granite Pail</i> 8)</font><br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is a record of her mother's voice, and could be read simply as 
          a memorial to her, a poetic stone with her mother's words inscribed 
          on it, set firmly in the ground of modernist poetry. It could be read 
          as the kind of populist appeal to the value and wisdom of ordinary, 
          found speech made in the Wisconsin guide in its treatment of examples 
          of local idiom like that collected in Peppin, which Oppen criticised 
          in poetry. It could also be read as an amusing instance of the spirit 
          shown by women who use their verbal dexterity to maintain their dignity 
          in the midst of an impoverished life, manifested most immediately by 
          the disgusting habits of their working men, who too readily give way 
          to tobacco and drink in the face of the pressures of poverty. Doing 
          so makes the spitbox metonymically represent a whole way of life. Or 
          it could be taken to symbolise the father, and more generally patriarchy, 
          a revenant that will not stay buried whatever the women do, because 
          the dead father remains pivotal to the entire signifying system. At 
          this point in our interpretations the anachronism of a Lacanian reading 
          begins to gleam in the box, yet I do not want to simply dismiss this 
          more psychoanalytic direction as a seduction that the poem never intended, 
          nor to treat the other possible interpretations as too biographical 
          to be persuasive engagements with its textuality. The poem deliberately 
          offers multiple possibilities of interpretation, but they are embedded 
          within a more complex relation to the reader that depends upon what 
          is understood by folk poetry, and the intersubjective relations within 
          which it works. To ignore this is to become a museum man, to put the 
          spitbox too readily alongside the other exhumed memorials of different 
          cultures on display in the museological culture of metropolitan modernity, 
          which exhibits objects, including poems, as if their meaning resided 
          in a discrete objectivity open to interpretative strategies which presuppose 
          a generality of motivation and affect. The poem can sit on the desk 
          all ready to be understood. Yet local cultures don't necessarily think 
          of objects in this way at all. Their artefacts may be entirely embedded 
          in relational networks would never make possible the anonymous hermeneutic 
          perspective on a distinct object, and by being so immanent within the 
          culture would never have those necessary boundaries presupposed by these 
          modernist methods of interpretation. <br>
          <br>
          The spitbox poem could be read as a demonstration of museological skills, 
          because it takes the folk speech and puts it on display. It also offers 
          something more. &quot;The museum man!&quot; is an expostulation whose 
          value is hard to assess, since it could be placed almost anywhere on 
          a spectrum between a curse and a cry of delighted realisation at the 
          answer to a problem. Its speaker imagines the act of conferring value 
          on the spitbox as one in which the box is taken out of its local context 
          and placed in a museum where it would become an object that helped create 
          an image of the material past. The only alternative appears to be burial, 
          as if burial were somehow the cheap equivalent. This could be read as 
          a parable of the problem faced by the poem itself, either burial in 
          the locality of Niedecker's world, or the museum of international poetry 
          publishing. The poem knows that the poet will have to become &quot;the 
          museum man&quot; and put the spitbox on show, but doing so will not 
          solve the problem, because the object will be untouched and still disgusting. 
          Some of this disgust is not directly communicable, so it excludes the 
          stranger reading the poem because the speaker hopes to create common 
          cause against the father with those who have witnessed the intrusive 
          habits and presence, especially the way he uses his mouth, the physiological 
          site of the oral, folk speech in the poem, for spitting. The spitbox 
          is therefore an image of a degraded source of poetry, an image of the 
          repressed that will insist on returning, because the unconscious, Yeats' 
          &quot;foul rag and bone shop of the heart&quot; (392), is the only source 
          of poetry. This folk speech knows something of psychoanalytic truths, 
          and it also knows that its knowledge is going to be put on display. 
          What it can do is anticipate such recontextualisation, and it does so 
          by using folk speech as both medium and theme. Niedecker's language 
          for ways of avoiding the ideology of the museum man was folklore studies. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Seven years after the publication of Niedecker's principal collection 
          of what she called &quot;folk&quot; poems in <i>New Goose</i> (1946), 
          a short essay appeared in the journal <i>Western Folklore</i>, entitled 
          &quot;What is a folk poet?&quot; by T.M.Pearce. This essay is a useful 
          indicator of what was meant by folk poetry at the time that Niedecker 
          was composing her own folk poems. The most striking feature of the discussion 
          is that despite the currency of the name &quot;folk poetry&quot;, there 
          is according to the author no agreement about what the role and definition 
          of a folk poet is, despite the wealth of studies of folk poetry. This 
          indeterminacy probably helped make the term attractive to Niedecker. 
          One reason for the uncertainty was the relative neglect of poetry in 
          favour of other genres like songs, tales and drama, and another was 
          the methodological difficulty of dealing with printed material in a 
          field that took as axiomatic that folk culture was orally transmitted. 
          Writing in 1952, Stith Thompson, author of a multi-volume tabulation 
          of the structures of folktales, is emphatic that &quot;folklore is transmitted 
          by oral tradition&quot; (266), but as Pearce and others recognised, 
          oral poetry is almost always found alongside written counterparts in 
          western cultures. Eric Havelock has more recently argued that we still 
          don't fully understand the relation of written texts to their oral counterparts, 
          whether they are texts gathered in the field, or texts formed from oral 
          materials, like Homer or the New Testament. Folk poetry highlights these 
          problems.<br>
          <br>
          Given these dilemmas, Pearce avoids abstract debate and offers a specific 
          case study of a Spanish American folk poet living in a small town near 
          Albuquerque, who has been writing poems for both sacred and secular 
          occasions for many years, without publishing them in the ordinary sense. 
          Lack of publication doesn't matter because these poems do circulate 
          in the local public sphere. They are regularly sung and read in public 
          in the town where he is very well known, and he keeps a written record 
          of them in a ledger. Some poems celebrate the visit of important people, 
          others murders and fatal accidents, and a few his own personal experiences, 
          but the common element is the degree of specific relation to the community, 
          &quot;the sense of solidarity belonging to a homogeneous group dwelling 
          in one community neighborhood, of one religous faith, united in a common 
          activity, speaking the same language about it, in both literal and figurative 
          senses&quot; (245). The poet entirely lacks the alienation that is often 
          taken as the starting point of modern art, and already implicit in the 
          very term &quot;avant-garde&quot;: &quot;the poet is one of them: his 
          words are their words and their thoughts are his&quot; (246). This description 
          sounds idealised (an idealisation often heard in earlier folk-lore studies), 
          because its measure of such continuity derives from an unexamined contrast 
          with a modernity in which such pure intersubjectivity is no longer possible. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Some twenty five years after Pearce's essay, Roger DeV. Renwick, in 
          his study <i>English Folk Poetry</i>, echoes most of Pearce's definitions. 
          Renwick emphasises that folk poetry is intended to have immediate local 
          effects amongst the people known directly to the poet, so each poem 
          is designed to &quot;inform, to persuade, to manipulate&quot;, and more 
          generally to help sustain community ties (3). Folk poetry nurtures active 
          local intersubjectivities. <br>
          <br>
          Pearce sums up his findings in a manner which unconsciously assumes 
          a modernist role for the true poet, saying that for this Spanish American 
          writer, &quot;identity as an author is not suppressed, but his individuality 
          as a poet is submerged in the stream of group or community feeling which 
          animates all his compositions&quot; (248). Thompson also relies on this 
          distinction between individuality which is the mark of literary authorship, 
          and the anonymity of the folk artist whose work is authored by a &quot;common 
          milieu&quot;(254). This opposition of author and poet assumes that poets 
          are literary figures whose standpoint is not only necessarily distinct 
          from the community, but conforms to an aesthetic that transcends local 
          historical circumstances, rather than emerging from them. Authors live 
          in the stream of feeling that makes the more alienated role of the poet 
          impossible.<br>
          <br>
          This &quot;stream of feeling&quot; demands comparison with another image 
          of collective sentiment, Raymond Williams's concept of the structure 
          of feeling, which he first articulated at about the same time, and went 
          on using throughout his career in a series of changing theories. Individual 
          literary achievement emerges from the social experience of new literary 
          movements which take shape first as &quot;structures of feeling&quot;, 
          or common ways of thought that are still at &quot;the very edge of semantic 
          availability&quot; (<i>Marxism</i> 134) as qualitative changes in a 
          general form of life encourage artists to register &quot;<i>changes 
          of presence</i>&quot; in &quot;meanings and values as they are actively 
          lived and felt&quot; (132). The resulting art is therefore not wholly 
          determined by existing traditions, forms and institutions. It is to 
          some extent entirely new, and so the field of cultural practice only 
          gradually reaches conceptual, cognitive and linguistic realisation. 
          One of the best known forms of such structures of feeling in modernity 
          is the sequence of avant-gardes, which come into being as a metropolitan 
          network of individuals who are commonly immigrants to the metropolis, 
          and therefore &quot;share no common language but that of the metropolis 
          and whose other (including visual) received sign-systems have become 
          distanced or irrelevant&quot; (<i>Culture</i> 84). This makes their 
          work especially relevant to the developing urban culture itself, which 
          in the modern period shows a marked tendency to agglomeration in a few 
          metropolises, to an internationalisation of its horizons, and &quot;a 
          correspondingly high cultural mobility&quot;. Williams' account of the 
          phenomenon of the avant-garde is only partially accurate, as the case 
          of the rural avant-gardist, Lorine Niedecker, shows. Too many poets 
          and artists have lived outside the metropolis for this generalisation 
          to stand, and other groupings that fulfil all of these criteria have 
          not been avant-garde. What makes this formulation useful is the way 
          that it adopts the standpoint of the metropolitan avant-garde and then 
          identifies problems of communication, circulation and locality as central 
          to its self-identity in terms that mirror the distinction between such 
          a network and the situation of the folk poet as described by the folklorists. 
          <br>
          <br>
          These two images of the poet's social relations as either the emergence 
          from a stream of feeling or a structure of feeling (climbing out of 
          the river or leaving a building perhaps) are apparently antithetical. 
          In one case the stream of feeling suppresses the alienating development 
          of artistic self-consciousness and avant-garde ambitions, and in the 
          other it actually fosters such development in the absence of ordinary 
          community. But the supposed difference between them does not bear close 
          examination. Both images are dependent upon similar idealisations of 
          a social life which is more heterogenous, and more conflicted than either 
          image suggests. Pearce's poet actually sounds more detached from his 
          community than Pearce wants to recognise, and artists of the avant-garde 
          often have more powerful local ties and ethnic connections than Williams 
          acknowledges. Pearce and Williams, despite their different fields of 
          enquity, both assume that alienation and immersion in a community are 
          mutually exclusive, and that the former is the necessary predisposition 
          for innovative art. Niedecker's work can be read as an attempt to show 
          that this assumption is wrong. Her interest in folk culture can be interpreted 
          as an attempt to give the stream of feeling a structure, and to make 
          the structure of feeling more fluid, as she becomes both the avant-garde 
          poet who has undergone reverse immigration from the metropolis, and 
          the small town folk poet whose audience is an emergent cultural group 
          in the metropolis. <br>
          <br>
          And yet Niedecker is not a folk poet by the definitions of the folklorists. 
          She kept her poetry secret from the local community, she avoided the 
          cliches and the stereotyped forms that folk poets tend to use, and she 
          was published in the most prestigous avant-garde journals. She is closer 
          to Pearce and Renwick than to the poets on whom they report. It is as 
          if Niedecker is both folk poet and folklorist in one. She believed her 
          poetry was best transmitted &quot;from one person to another, spoken 
          thus, or (perish the thought, I suppose?!) read silently&quot; (Faranda 
          15), a conception of the circulation of poetry which seems close to 
          the folk tradition as the folklorists describe it, but in making this 
          demand what she was doing was to propose a new set of relations between 
          poet, poem and reader to the sophisticates of the avant-garde in order 
          to draw attention to ways in which words and forms of literary address 
          operate within actual modern social structures. She takes the simplest 
          structures and show that they have a whole other dimension of meaning 
          that the avant-garde sometimes misses because of the way its constitutive 
          social structures necessarily form its reading practice as well. <br>
          <br>
          Consider her poem &quot;Remember my little granite pail&quot; (which 
          Corman singled out for the title of his selection <i>The Granite Pail</i> 
          as if this object could be metonymic of an entire body of work) within 
          a contextualisation that Niedecker herself might have approved of, a 
          comparison with William Carlos Williams' poem &quot;The red wheelbarrow&quot;. 
          In a letter to Corman of February 11, 1965 she speculatively discussed 
          a possible anthology of short poems, and named names : Mother Goose 
          rhymes, haiku, Keats, Herrick, Dickinson, Blake, Donne, Dante, Hopkins, 
          Burns, Shakespeare (her joking comment, &quot;We might let Shakespeare 
          in!&quot;, could be read as a resistance to the kind of bardolatry that 
          Zukofsky indulged in), and amongst contemporaries she mentioned Corman 
          himself, poems from <i>Origin</i>, and poems by Reznikoff, Zukofsky 
          and William Carlos Williams notoriously sybilline poem &quot;The red 
          wheelbarrow&quot; (Faranda 51).<br>
          <br>
          Niedecker's poem is a series of short end-stopped sentences which appear 
          very simple:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><br>
              Remember my little granite pail?<br>
              The handle of it was blue.<br>
              Think what's got away in my life---<br>
              Was enough to carry me thru. (<i>Granite Pail</i> 7)<br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Williams' poem is more gnomic:<br>
        </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>so much depends<br>
              upon</p>
            <p> a red wheel<br>
              barrow</p>
            <p> glazed with rain<br>
              water</p>
            <p> beside the white<br>
              chickens (<i>Collected Poems</i> 1: 224)<br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Williams' poem, although brief and articulated in a simple vocabulary, 
          will probably strike most readers as more complex because of the way 
          it moves in a column down the page without punctuation, isolating words 
          and phrases with what appears to be portentous emphasis whose significance 
          is not initially evident. Oppen, as we saw, singled out this poem as 
          the symptom of a populist sentimentality afflicting modern poets. Both 
          poems evoke an ordinary utilitarian object and then by a sudden twist 
          of conceptual perspective invite the reader to speculate on much larger 
          issues. Both poems use colloquial speech (&quot;so much depends upon&quot;; 
          &quot;was enough to carry me thru&quot;). We have confirmation that 
          folk idiom was uppermost in Niedecker's mind from a letter in which 
          she told Zukofsky that she would have written &quot;Was enough to have 
          carried me thru&quot; instead, &quot;but folk don't say that, they slur 
          it over into simply what I did say&quot; (Penberthy, <i>Niedecker Correspondence</i> 
          290). Folk speech is the final court of appeal, so that what she says 
          in the poem can be taken as a reliable guide to the actual phrasing 
          used by &quot;folk&quot;. <br>
          <br>
          Williams' poem knowingly invokes the Romantic tradition that would invest 
          a landscape with emotional and spiritual meaning, and then challenges 
          a reader to repeat the process with this nugatory scene. Her poem initially 
          refuses such intertextual challenges to the literary tradition. Instead 
          it insists upon its specific reference to her situation by its opening 
          and excluding line which invites its reader to do the impossible. Only 
          she (and perhaps a few intimates), can perform this act of recollection. 
          The poem's address effectively delineates a reader too precisely, so 
          that readers who are not from this locale cannot make the initial imaginative 
          act that will enable them to fulfil the demands of the poem. The pail 
          remains out of reach of the reader's effort to give fully realise its 
          significance. Contrast this with Williams' poem which actually affirms 
          a common relation between writer and reader to the literary tradition, 
          and so universalises this relation in the process. The specificity of 
          the red wheelbarrow remains only as a symbol of sensuous particularity 
          that cannot be subsumed into conceptual thought, because the distinctiveness 
          of this singular wheelbarrow disappears in the process of exemplification. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Charles Taylor argues that this kind of procedure is evidence of a persistent 
          Romantic strategy for creating something that cannot be simply subsumed 
          into a large conceptual framework. He traces the avant-garde back to 
          the Romantic ideal of epiphanic art: &quot;the aim is not just to portray 
          but to transfigure through the representation, to render the object 
          'translucent'&quot; (419).. Modernist art has shifted focus from the 
          representation of external objects to the making of the work of art 
          itself but remains expectant of the same form of response. Even for 
          Romantic art, however, &quot;we can't understand what it is qua epiphany 
          by pointing to some independently available object described or referent. 
          What the work reveals has to be read in it&quot;(420). An epiphany is 
          defined by Taylor in a way that reveals the degree to which its registration 
          of an otherwise inarticulable experience is both paradigmatically &quot;local&quot; 
          and yet paradoxically also a moment when the significance of the experience 
          becomes transferable into other terms. An epiphany is &quot;the locus 
          of a manifestation which brings us into the presence of something which 
          is otherwise inaccessible, and which is of the highest moral and spiritual 
          significance&quot;. Williams' poem about the red wheelbarrow registers 
          a moment which the reader is invited to interpret as an epiphany without 
          any supporting discourse. Not just anyone can testify to such moments. 
          To be sensitive enough to recognise these moments the avant-garde artist 
          has to be an exceptional being, experience exceptional suffering, live 
          an isolated life, and one that is somehow ahead of bourgeois society 
          (423). This claim to be exceptional, implicit for example in Zukofsky's 
          desire to measure himself against all other poets, was rejected by Niedecker.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Remember my little granite pail&quot; insists that the sensuous 
          particularity of experience depends upon the specific social relations 
          in which it occurs. Her poem also implies that art should avoid the 
          universal if universality means the complete fungibility of value exemplified 
          by commodities. Her literary art insists on the absolute difference 
          made by the relations in which the work is received, to the meaning 
          of the poem. The reader's inevitable failure to recall the granite pail 
          is a reminder that this poem has or had readers for whom the intimate 
          local reference gave it other significances unavailable to the outside, 
          abstract audience. What the poem does is to insist that what it means 
          depends upon the relations between writer, poem and reader. The meaning 
          of the pail will differ according to one's intersubjective relation 
          to the history from which this poem emerges (as relative, neighbour, 
          someone brought up with similar utensils, or a reader remote in time 
          and space from it who might not even know that a granite pail is a pail 
          or bucket which has a characteristic, granite-grey finish). This tacit 
          insistence that the reader's specific relation affects the poem directly, 
          rather than through some free act of interpretative choice, is the poetic 
          at work here, which therefore does finally make a countervailing move 
          away from the utterly personal and local history of the relation to 
          the pail, to this more general aesthetic point. In making a general 
          move it is recognisable to the reader of the Williams poem, but only 
          by inviting the reader to reflect on the kinds of assumptions that enable 
          &quot;The red wheelbarrow&quot; to be at once red and read. <br>
          <br>
          Niedecker's strategy can be described in another way. The answer to 
          the question of what happens to an utterance when it is placed in a 
          poem will depend upon what theory of the aesthetic we have. Niedecker's 
          poetry questions fundamental assumptions about what constitutes the 
          aesthetic, and can be placed within a quite different set of debates 
          than those of the avant-garde poets. For poets, aesthetics is largely 
          a matter of practice and pragmatic discourses on method, value and insight, 
          but philosophers trace their arguments directly back to a founding synthesis 
          of englightenment thought in Kant's Critique of Judgement. Kant effectively 
          argued that knowledge, morality and art were independent realms of experience, 
          and a work of art therefore could not be judged for its truth in the 
          way a scientific theory about the boiling point of liquids could. Once 
          the folk speech is in a poem its significance changes utterly. This 
          categorial separation of spheres has been the element in which the avant-garde 
          flourished and fought to claim its importance, but is art really independent 
          in the way that modern culture largely assumes (even if some poets struggle 
          against this enfeebling autonomy)? <br>
          <br>
          The philosopher J. M. Bernstein argues that modern post-Enlightenment 
          philosophy separated off the arts from cognitive truth and ethics because 
          it believed that the concepts which organised rational thought were 
          independent of the context in which they were used. They were believed 
          to be what he calls &quot;topic-neutral&quot;, unaffected by the context 
          in which they were placed, just as logical operators are not altered 
          by the elements on which they work. He argues that most concepts are 
          not like this. &quot;Actual inferences, and hence patterns of inference, 
          are dependent upon the practices in which concepts are employed&quot; 
          (168). The statement &quot;all bachelors are married&quot; is supposed 
          to be logically contradictory, yet it is actually falsified not by the 
          law of non-contradiction but by social practices. It might be possible 
          for bachelors to be married if our social habits changed, and it is 
          certainly the case that unmarried men are not necessarily bachelors. 
          In Niedecker's poem, it is not just the pail that is specific to her 
          world, but also phrases like &quot;what's got away&quot; and the concept 
          of something being able to &quot;carry&quot; one through. Put these 
          concepts into another context, another mouth, another poem, another 
          collection of poems, and their meaning may alter. They are not &quot;topic-neutral&quot;. 
          Neither Niedecker nor the dictionary create the meanings of these terms. 
          &quot;Intersubjective practice&quot;, as Bernstein calls it, is what 
          does the work. This intersubjective practice may be a metropolitan network 
          &quot;who share no common language but that of the metropolis&quot; 
          in Raymond Williams words cited earlier, or it may be an epistolary 
          friendship like that between Niedecker and Zukofsky, or it may be the 
          everyday world of Blackhawk Island. If it were only a matter of setting 
          up a network or locating oneself within a strongly established geographically 
          defined one, the problem would be largely a matter of choice, but unfortunately 
          the entire process of modernisation is moving against this. The economic 
          doctrine of the &quot;market place&quot; for example, treats objects 
          as all equivalent according to the one scale of monetary value. Many 
          modern discursive and procedural frameworks turn fields of our lifeworlds 
          into systems, &quot;rendering various objects and practices effectively 
          intersubjectively meaningless&quot; (169). Even something as benign 
          as a didactic poetry anthology actually works by setting up a procedural 
          structure of comparisons that is supposedly independent of the poems 
          it organises. Bernstein has a particularly useful linguistic metaphor 
          for representing this process whereby a syntax seems to overwhelm the 
          individual sensuousness of words. He says that frameworks like power 
          and money &quot;trump&quot; the intersubjective world by placing their 
          objects and concepts within a syntax which dominates them: &quot;with 
          the notion of....syntactical trumping, empirical predicates are subsumed 
          within a structure that detaches their potential for meaning from both 
          intersubjective practices and their referential objects&quot; (169). 
          Another way of saying this is that modernisation, the rationalisation 
          of everyday life, works by replacing the kind of judgement associated 
          with art in Kant's system, the &quot;reflective judgement&quot; which 
          tries to respond to what is unique in an experience, with another form 
          of judgement which instead subsumes the experience under an abstract 
          category that then makes it recognisable to the methods of science or 
          other kinds of formal knowledge which investigate general and invariant 
          conditions. Such rationalisation has brought enormous benefits. The 
          problem lies in its undiscriminating sweep. <br>
          <br>
          Poets have had to negotiate their own relation to these developments, 
          and the avant-garde poets have tended to accept the seeming benefits 
          of such rationalisation as a means of placing their work alongside the 
          other great intellectual developments of modernity, and therefore resisting 
          the modern tendency to sideline it in an aesthetic museum, away from 
          all possibility of active intervention in affairs. Zukofsky assumes 
          that poems speak for all poets, and demonstrate an ability to use the 
          framework of the anthology as a syntax for transforming the local meanings 
          of poems into units that then speak in both a universal and more suprisingly, 
          a personal voice (making <i>Pericles</i> a comment on an old affair). 
          Oppen believes that the use of folk speech depends upon the assumption 
          that the reader will interpret its very use, not the content of the 
          speech itself, as a general claim about the virtues of populism. Both 
          poets imagine that a reader will make these metadiscursive moves as 
          part of the practice of art. By contrast Niedecker's poetry resists 
          such incursions at a level which recognises some of the implicit assumptions 
          made necessary by the move to &quot;supersenses&quot; or aesthetic meta-discourses 
          that affect the avant-garde practices of all these poets. According 
          to Bernstein, the history of modern art is a story of increasingly hectic 
          strategies aimed at keeping art local by using ever-changing methods 
          (like resisting the reader's rush to interpretation by making the surface 
          of the poem opaque in some way) so that the work cannot easily be assimilated 
          by being subsumed into some exemplary narrative or universalising commentary 
          that would trump the art and neutralise its specificity. Niedecker's 
          poetry suggests that the avant-garde has been too ready to accept the 
          conditions of modernity, and that re-examining the relations in which 
          poems circulate may be as radical as other more striking forms of linguistic 
          innovation. Her poetry shows that she was extremely aware of a problem 
          that Bernstein's history does not go on to explore, the countervailing 
          need for art to find networks of readers who probably do not share the 
          local life-worlds which might provide ordinary contexts of intersubjective 
          meaning. It is within this space of conflicting demands that Niedecker's 
          poetry operates, and this is why she seems oddly suspended between the 
          apparently incompatible worlds of the avant-garde and folk poetry. The 
          complexities of Niedecker's work arise from the way it challenges these 
          features of the avant-garde which usually operate below the horizon 
          of awareness to constitute its reception and institutionalisation. <br>
          <br>
          The consequences of Niedecker's resistances to appropriation are especially 
          evident when she is seemingly engaged in just the same practice that 
          Zukofsky promulgated in <i>A Test of Poetry</i>. Her poem &quot;I rose 
          from marsh mud&quot; (<i>Granite Pail </i>24) has a close textual relation 
          with Emily Dickinson's poem &quot;She rose to his requirement&quot;, 
          which was originally published with the title &quot;The wife&quot; (<i>Selected</i> 
          47). Niedecker would only have known this heavily edited version at 
          the time she wrote her poem, because the later version with dashes as 
          punctuation had not yet appeared at the time she wrote<b><font size="2" color="#006666">2</font></b>. 
          In Dickinson's poem the woman's marriage is narrated in a remarkably 
          double voice, which seems to endorse entirely the conventional standpoint 
          on marriage, yet gradually allows an ironic distance from it:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><br>
              She rose to his requirement, dropped<br>
              The playthings of her life<br>
              To take the honorable work<br>
              Of woman and of wife.<br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Only by becoming a wife does she become a woman according to the discourse 
          reproduced here. The first line puns on the &quot;rose&quot; that the 
          woman is often likened to, and also plays with the idea of rising and 
          falling. In the following stanzas the wife's virtues are imagined as 
          pearl and weed at the bottom of a sea of her husband's enveloping patriarchal 
          presence, through a concealed pun on &quot;sea&quot;, which emphasises 
          the degree to which the ocean represents concealment, not being able 
          to see anything except the husband. Not only is he all that can be seen, 
          but his honourable words have largely taken over the poem as well. <br>
          <br>
          The poem's feminist irony seems at odds with a troubling passivity in 
          the wife, and it is this that Niedecker considers in her poem. Dickinson's 
          poem is written from outside the marriage by someone who admits not 
          knowing what the wife misses or possesses in herself anymore because 
          all that this observer can witness is the veiling sea. Niedecker displaces 
          the verb &quot;rose&quot; to a first person narrator who reports first 
          hand observation of the marriage of a &quot;little white slave-girl&quot; 
          in church. This narrator actually emerges out of the mud where pearls 
          and weeds might hide, but her element is marsh not sea, a careful, precise 
          &quot;de-universalization&quot; that relocates the scene to the exact 
          place where she lives: <br>
        </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote>
            <p>I rose from marsh mud,<br>
              algae, equisetum, willows<br>
              sweet green, noisy<br>
              birds and frogs.<br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>By listing the fauna and flora the narrator almost becomes one of them, 
          a willow, or a bird, or perhaps a &quot;marsh rose&quot;. The word mud 
          clogs the rhythm, emphasising dirtiness and fertility at once. But the 
          most striking shift is the move into the first person, as if Dickinson's 
          poem had been written about Niedecker (or more precisely the narrator 
          of the poem). This is a strong act of appropriation. The drowned spirit 
          of the married woman in Dickinson's poem has returned in Niedecker, 
          who rises out of the weeds into the world of poetry.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;I rose from marsh mud&quot; makes itself a daughter, or at least 
          claims kinship with the earlier poet, so that its correction is not 
          an overthrow in a fit of anxiety of influence, nor a homage to an enduring 
          cultural monument, but something else. It wants to &quot;inform, to 
          persuade, to manipulate&quot; Dickinson's poem, as if she were part 
          of the poet's community, because it recognises that the poem is, in 
          Hurston's words, part of the &quot;boiled down juice of human living&quot; 
          that needs to be recirculated to readers. By inhabiting Dickinson's 
          opening phrase &quot;she rose&quot;, Niedecker demonstrates an extension 
          of the folk relations that her poetry inscribes within its practices 
          of meaning. The apparent lucidity of Niedecker's poetry is like the 
          sea in Dickinson's poem. Its significances, its virtues and its limitations, 
          can easily remain unacknowledged, a poetics of weed and pearls within 
          the sea of a largely masculine modernism, unless readers learn to recognise 
          that this poetry is also capable of arising from the marsh mud to provide 
          a disturbing witness at the marriage of false unities, the bride and 
          groom &quot;United for life to serve/ silver&quot; in the high temples 
          of culture. Then the poetry's remarkable exploration of the poetics 
          of cultural transmission, and what happens when a poem is placed alongside 
          the poems of other poets, or when speech is placed inside a poem, will 
          be able to play its part in the shaping of new understanding of the 
          cultural dynamics of literary modernism.</p>
