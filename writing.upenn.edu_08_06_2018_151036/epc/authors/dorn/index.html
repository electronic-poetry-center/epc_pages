          <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the death of Edward Dorn the United States loses not only one of 
          its finest poets but a rare critical intelligence and cultural commentator. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Dorn was born in rural Illinois at the start of the Great Depression, 
          in poverty. He was educated in a one room schoolhouse, then High School 
          (where he helped on the local newspaper) and for two years at the University 
          of Illinois. He worked for a while at the Boeing plant in Seattle, returned 
          to Illinois, and through his art teacher Raymond Obermayr was directed 
          towards Black Mountain College in North Carolina where he arrived in 
          the autumn of 1950. <br>
          <br>
          In 1951 he left and travelled to the Pacific Northwest, where he did 
          manual work and met his first wife, Helene. In late 1954 they returned 
          to Black Mountain, where he studied under Charles Olson (Dorn's first 
          published work was the pamphlet <I>What I See in the Maximus Poems</I>) 
          and graduated in 1955 with Robert Creeley as one of his examiners. After 
          two years of further travel the family settled in Washington state. 
          Their life there, on the edge of poverty, is vividly portrayed in Dorn's 
          first prose book, <I>The Rites of Passage </I>(later republished as 
          <I>By The Sound</I>). By 1959 they were in New Mexico, and at the end 
          of 1961 moved to Pocatello, where Dorn taught at the University of Idaho 
          until the middle of 1965.<br>
          <br>
          Donald Allen's anthology <I>The New American Poetry</I> (1960) included 
          some of Dorn's early poems, but his first book <I>The Newly Fallen</I> 
          was not published until 1961 by Amiri Baraka (then LeRoi Jones)'s Totem 
          Press in New York. Three years later the same press published <I>Hands 
          Up!</I> Poems from this period, so clear, moving, unromantic and filled 
          with the memories of his hard early life -- &quot;On the Debt My Mother 
          Owed to Sears Roebuck,&quot; for example -- echoed not only in the United 
          States, but across the Atlantic.<br>
          <br>
          In the summer of 1965 Dorn and the photographer Leroy Lucas collaborated 
          on <I>The Shoshoneans: The People of the Basin Plateau</I> -- a book 
          too long out-of-print which anticipated the now fashionable interest 
          in all things Native American, and gracefully left the last words not 
          to the authors, but to Clyde Warrior, an activist. <br>
          <br>
          That autumn, at the invitation of Donald Davie, the family arrived in 
          England where, with a year's break, Dorn was to teach at the new University 
          of Essex until 1970. Dorn arrived already aware of the work of young 
          British poets such as Tom Pickard and Lee Harwood, and he had corresponded 
          for some time with J.H.Prynne ( who accompanied the Dorns on their trans-atlantic 
          liner). The American poet Tom Clark was a graduate student at Essex 
          and shared many of Dorn's interests. <br>
          <br>
          Creeley, Olson and other visitors passed through the various flats and 
          houses in Colchester and Wivenhoe. On the faculty was Gordon Brotherston, 
          and Dorn began with him a series of collaborative translations of Latin 
          American poetry that continued for decades. He met Jennifer Dunbar, 
          his second wife. In London there was a lively small press scene and 
          Stuart and Deirdre Montgomerys' Fulcrum Press published two collections 
          of poems: <I>Geography</I> (1965), and <I>The North Atlantic Turbine 
          </I>(1967). And Dorn began to write <I>Gunslinger</I>, one of the major 
          North American long poems, first published as a sequence of books while 
          in progress and finally as one volume in 1975, the year after its completion. 
          Those years saw the Dorns in Chicago, in Mexico, and, with occasional 
          breaks, in San Francisco. Dorn's early newspaper experience and his 
          work in the Print Shop at Black Mountain combined in the tabloid <I>Bean 
          News</I>, with contributions by Prynne and other correspondents. His 
          neighbour Holbrook Teter's old linotype machine, held together with 
          wire, produced the type for this, and for the complete <I>Gunslinger</I>, 
          while Teter's partner Michael Myers drew the elegant cover for <I>Recollections 
          of</I> <I>Gran Apacher&iacute;a</I>, Dorn's next book.<br>
          <br>
          In the autumn of 1977 Dorn began to teach at the University of Colorado 
          in Boulder where, in 1980, he and his wife Jennifer started <I>Rolling 
          Stock </I>(motto: &quot;If it moves, print it!&quot;), a newspaper sized 
          journal that encompassed their many interests (including a delightful 
          golf column by Nick Sedgwick) and ran throughout the decade. Still happy 
          to work with his hands he built his own workroom with scrap timber. 
          The academic world didn't escape his pen... <I>Captain Jack's Chaps</I> 
          (1983), is an hilarious account of the MLA conference in Houston, and 
          he ended the decade with <I>Abhorrences</I> (1990), a collection of 
          short, savage observations.<br>
          <br>
          During his last years he continued to travel... in Montana, in Wyoming.. 
          and to write (even a Country and Western song) with undiminished energy. 
          An exchange year teaching in the south of France, at Montpellier, sparked 
          a new interest in the Cathars and Simon de Montfort. It is thanks to 
          Nicholas Johnston's Etruscan Books that some of his later work is in 
          print in Britain. <br>
          <br>
          Dorn suffered fools not at all, and sloppy thinking not for a moment: 
          a lonely position at the best of times, and one that made him almost 
          persona non grata in the current literary and academic climate of his 
          homeland. <br>
          <br>
          For anyone interested to see how wit, intelligence and a dispassionate 
          eye can survive through pain, I suggest reading &quot;Chemo du Jour&quot; 
          (<I>Denver Quarterly</I>, Spring 99) ... .the Clinton impeachment seen 
          through chemotherapy. A line in a note this morning from the Swansea-born 
          poet Doug Lang comes to mind: &quot;When I first read his work, in 1970, 
          it changed my idea about what poetry could be.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Dorn died at home, in his own bed, with his family beside him, in the 
          West: a pure American who didn't go crazy. Fools can sleep easier.<br>
