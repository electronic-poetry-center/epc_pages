      <div align="justify"><span class="style11"> Edward
        Dorn, creative poet and educator best 
        remembered for his epic 
        five-volume poem &quot;Gunslinger,&quot; which has been likened to a
        
        Western American &quot;Canterbury
        
        Tales,&quot; is dead at 70.
        
        
        
        Dorn,
        leader of the
        University of Colorado's creative 
        writing program for the last
        two decades, died Friday in Boulder. </span>
      </div>
      <P align="justify" class="style11">
        
        
        The poet
        was one of many
        avant-garde artists in various disciplines--including dancer
        Merce Cunningham, composer John Cage, painters Elaine and
        
        Willem de Kooning and
        
        architect/inventor Buckminster
        
        Fuller--who attended the
        
        utopian Black Mountain College
        
        in North Carolina. The
        
        college, which functioned from
        
        1933 to 1956, had only one
        
        rule--&quot;be intelligent.&quot;
        
        Teachers and students built their own
        
        dormitories and classrooms,
        
        grew their own food and jointly
        
        determined their courses of
        
        study and lives.
        <P align="justify" class="style11"><span class="style11">The native
          of Villa 
          Grove, Ill., once described himself as 
          being &quot;educated at the
          University of Illinois and somewhat corrected at Black Mountain
          
          College.&quot;        </span>
        
        <P align="justify" class="style11">&quot;Black
          Mountain as a
          school,&quot; he said, &quot;denotes a certain
          value toward learning and the
          analysis of ideas. . . . The institution's importance to me
          
          would be incalculable.&quot;
        <P align="justify" class="style11">Since 1961,
        Dorn had
        taught English and creative writing 
        regularly, beginning with 
        Idaho State University, where he co-edited the literary
          
        publication &quot;Wild Dog,&quot; and ending at
          
          Colorado. In between were
          
          visiting stints at the University of
          
          Essex in England, the
          
          University of Kansas, UC Riverside and
          
          UC San Diego.
          
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        
        <P align="justify" class="style11"><span class="style11">During his
          career in 
          education, he wrote about three dozen 
          books of poetry, a collection 
          of short fiction titled &quot;Some Business Recently Transacted
          
          in the White World&quot; and in
          
          1965 a novel, &quot;The Rites of
          
          Passage.&quot;        </span>
        <P align="justify" class="style11">None was as
        well-received
        or as memorable as his 
        contemporary Western narrative 
        &quot;Gunslinger&quot; published from 1968 to 1972. Like the early
          
        &quot;Canterbury Tales,&quot; to which
          
          poet Robert Duncan compared
          
          Dorn's masterwork,
          
        &quot;Gunslinger&quot; involved a trek
          
          in search of enlightenment and
          
          the nightly tales told by the
          
          participants. In Dorn's allegorical
          
          epic, the musical instrument
          
          accompanying the entertaining
          
          yarns, appropriately, was
          
          dubbed an &quot;abso-lute.&quot;
        <P align="justify" class="style11">Dorn's band
        of pilgrims,
        all stoned on drugs, were led by 
        the Slinger, a 2,000-year-old 
        &quot;son of the sun,&quot; his dance hall madam companion Cocaine Lil
          
          and his talking horse, Claude
          
          Levi-Strauss. Their
          
          destination was Las Vegas, where they
          
          planned to confront Howard
          
          Hughes, whom they viewed as a
          
          robber baron intent on
          
        &quot;hustling the future.&quot;
        <P align="justify" class="style11">The actual
        purpose of the
        trek, however, the poet revealed 
        ever so slowly, was the 
        journey itself, or in Dorn's words: &quot;To see/ is their desire/ as they
          
          wander.&quot;
        <P align="justify" class="style11">In
        &quot;Gunslinger,&quot; Dorn,
          who once described his writing as
        &quot;clots of phrase,&quot; happily
          mixed jargon from junkies, Westerners and scientists into
          
          a jumble of speech, full of puns
          
          and nonsense words rarely
          
          interrupted by any punctuation.
        <P align="justify" class="style11">The work
        proved
        durable. When the separate small-press 
        volumes were gathered and 
        reprinted in 1989, a San Francisco Chronicle reviewer wrote:
          
&quot;This engaging extended narrative
          
          comes across today just as
          
          speedy, angular, subversive,
          
          eloquent, uplifting and funny
          
          as it was 20 years ago. And its
          
          principal satiric
          
          premise--'Entrapment is this society's/ sole
          
          activity. . . . Only
          
          laughter/can blow it to rags'--may now be
          
          more relevant than ever.&quot;      </p>
        <P align="justify" class="style11">His writings,
        in free
        verse or in prose, were virtually all 
        socially and politically 
        oriented. Asked about his criticism of America as imperialist, unfair
          
        to minorities and other ills, Dorn
          
        once said: &quot;I take democracy
          
          very seriously. . . . Democracy
          
          literally has to be cracked on
          
          the head all the time to keep it in
          
          good condition. But all other
          
          forms are more or less sudden
          
      death.&quot;</p></td>
