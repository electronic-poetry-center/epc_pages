<br><hr><br>

Ed  <P>

It was my finding a poem of Ed's quite by chance that put us in touch. It's
difficult now to explain how bleak and lonely the literary and intellectual
landscape was in the late fifties early sixties.... how few, and how
dispersed, like minds were: certainly over here. In our times together,
fragmented as they were over almost forty years and many places, there was
nothing that could not be talked about, no sacred cows: laughter and light
are my clearest memories. <P>

The last time I saw Ed and Jenny, this summer, he insisted on driving to
Boulder to collect me and bring me to Denver.  I knew that was all his
energy for the day, but didn't protest as I sensed it was important to him
to do it.  We drove down, remarking on the urban sprawl, the jerry-built
town houses, the strange shiny high-tech blocks that twenty years had
thrown along that highway.  Stopping at the University we loaded heavy boxes
of books from his office.  At home we sat on the porch scaring away
squirrels with an air-rifle: he hated them for attacking the fruit of an
apple tree he'd planted whose crop he'd never been able to taste.
Then he went to bed.  A particular gentleman to the end.  Style. <P>

"In my Youth I Was a Tireless Dancer"<br><br>

But now I pass <br>
graveyards in a car. <br>
The dead lie, <br>
unsuperstitiously, <br>
with their feet towards me- <br>
please forgive me for <br>
saying the tombstones would not <br>
fancy their faces turned from the highway.<br><br>

Oh perish the thought <br>
I was thinking in that moment <br>
Newman Illinois <br>
the Saturday night dance- <br>
what a life! Would I like it again? <br>
No. Once I returned late summer <br>
from California thin from journeying <br>
and the girls were not the same. <br>
You'll say that's natural <br>
they had been dancing all the time.
