<font size=6>Edward Dorn (1929-1999)</font>

<br><hr><br>

The poet Edward Dorn died after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer
at his home in Denver early on the evening of December 10,
1999.<br><br>

<ul>
Is this thing made<br>
with the end built-in<br>
the component of death hidden only<br>
in the youthful machine...<br><br>

ah news from the Great Manufacturer.<br><br>
</ul>

These lines come from "Wait by the door awhile Death, there are
others," a poem written by Dorn in 1965.  They foreshadow the
engagement and interrogation of Ed's last poems as well.  Along with
unfinished long poems about two other longtime subjects of his, heresy
and geography -- Languedoc Variorum and Westward Haut -- he left in
"progress" a verse journal of his final chemotherapeutic
nightmare-enlightenments, Chemo Sabe, in which the poet's
confrontation with techno-medicine serves as a kind of warrior's trial
and induction to death.  At the end of a section of that latter work,
titled "Chemo du Jour: The Impeachment on Decadron," he narrates an
infusion of Taxol, a drug produced from yew tree toxins, while
watching Clinton's impeachment trial, among other dark comedies, on
television in a Denver hospital:<br><br>

<ul>
And Lo now the Taxol infusion clears the atmosphere<br>
where I see the Superbowl completely superseded<br>
by the superblow, O yes, praise the Tree Lord,<br>
now it is time to go.<br><br>
</ul>

Ed was born and grew up in Eastern Illinois, on the banks of the river
Embarrass (a tributary of the Wabash).  He never knew his father.  His
mother was of French-Canadian ancestry, his maternal grandfather a
half-Indian Quebecois railroad man ("master pipefitter in the age of
steam").  He attended a one-room school, and while in high school
played billiards with the local undertaker for a dime a point.
"Brought up off and on during / the intensity of depression nomadism,"
he followed the wandering work-searches of his several "exodus
relatives" down "bleak grit avenues" of a childhood whose anxious,
difficult instruction, though he was always shy of speaking of it,
never ceased to underlie and complicate the moral and historical
vision of his work.  Images of vulnerability and displacement in his
poems project this.  In a late poem called "Tribe" Dorn declares an
explicit identification with the plight of refugee Kurds, relating
their exposure before the imperial contingency of "wholesale
helicopter gunships" to his own autobiographical family recollections:
"My tribe was lowdown struggling day labor / Depression South Eastern
/ Illinois just before the southern hills start / to roll toward the
coal country / where the east/west morainal ridges / of Wisconsin
trash pile up / at the bottom of the prairie, socially / a far midwest
recrudescence of Appalachia... I'm as proud of my tribe as if I were a
Kurd."<br><br>

<ul>
All may wake who live<br>
the combination is given<br>
and Some comb the connections<br>
in blind search<br>
there are deaths at birth<br>
there is death at 21<br>
       and burial at 80<br>
each calculation<br>
involves another century.<br><br>

Our company thus moves collectively<br>
along the River Rio Grande.<br>
<br>
    -- <I>Gunslinger, Book II</I><br><br>
</ul>

Maybe it's in part because he had a lonely and precarious beginning in
life that later on Dorn always liked to surround himself with
congenial company.  In life as in literature Ed had this weird little
travelling party or company: the cowboy, the dance hall madam, the
poet-singer, the Stoned Horse, among others.  The great honor of
friendship he conferred on me was to number me as an outrider of that
party of outriders, along with other diverse disparate friends. As to
Ed's itinerant young manhood out West -- of which one can get some
sense in an image from a Hands Up! poem, "a windborn seed" -- I
learned quite a bit from travelling with him across the upper Plains
in 1979 on what was supposed to be a reporting assignment.  We were
"covering" the Wyoming energy boom for a magazine, but Ed's coverage
always went deeper, wider, longer.  We crested the Wind River range in
white light and came down to Moorcroft, Wyoming, where Ed drove me
past the old New Moorcroft Hotel, a landmark in his great early story
"C. B. & Q.".  We found Tiny's restaurant, back of which the half
desert still begins, just as it does in that story.  In Ed's day crews
of gandy dancers hung out there between shifts.  Ed was remembering
his wandering working-life circa 1951, when "You could work endless
hours but it was dangerous."<br><br>

On that same trip we followed the Belle Fourche up toward the Badlands
and Ed had me walk around Devil's Tower with him.  It's a long way
around Devil's Tower.  When we got to the west face, looking out over
two hundred miles of prairie, I saw nothing, out at the horizon rim
the sky trembled and shone, in between the space looked completely
empty.  Ed then filled it for me with the substantial history of
everything that had ever happened out there.  He was always giving me
everything -- the most generous man I've ever known.<br><br>

<ul>
If it should ever come<br><br>

And we are all there together<br>
time will wave as willows do<br>
and adios will be truly, yes,<br>
laughing at what is forgotten<br>
and talking of what's new<br>
<br>
     --from <I>The Newly Fallen</I>, 1961<br>
