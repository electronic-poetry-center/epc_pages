          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's a strange and beautiful document of
              death. I mean, this is an account of living with an alien whose death
              only comes with the passing of its host. Like some ancient Gnostic
              heresies, modern oncology presents a terminology and strategy for
              addressing Evil. Only, cancer is not entirely a spiritual battle. The
              physical process is all too real, too terrible in its consequences. But
              in the Church of Big Science and Industrial Medicine, the tumor is that
              great Space Invader attacked by the fire and brimstone of post-modern
            pharmacology.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;On My 28, 1997, Ed was diagnosed with
              inoperable pancreatic cancer after exploratory surgery,&quot; writes
              Jennifer Dunbar Dorn in a preface to this letterpress chapbook. &quot;From
              now on,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I'm under House Arrest&mdash; / I only get out for the
              job: / Then, Death&mdash;the ultimate / House Arrest, the ultimate dur&eacute;e&mdash; /
            But it was worth it.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mostly, the 23 poems here were written in a
              spirit of tendence and aversion, archaic Greek practices for diverting
              evil and tending what good there is available. Despite submission to
              the medical industry, including four chemotherapies, these poems, some
              written in heightened or altered states, function as archaic
              penetrations into the cultural and personal meaning of his disease. By
              archaic, I mean there are no higher forces for Dorn to call on, no
              absolute vision underlying the rude and mundane core of his experience.
              There were just the words and actions of his professional healers,
              their practices and his reception of them within a greater frame of
              State. This Empire too establishes and maintains an industry devoted to
              pain and suffering, releasing carcinogens and then spending massive
              amounts of money to push toxins from dying hosts. The poet here leaves
              a record of perceptive living in actual conditions, even if those
              conditions are made of the psychopathology of contemporary state
            medicine.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the few poems not directly about his
              cancer relates a social and hereditary genealogy. &quot;My tribe,&quot; he wrote,
  &quot;came from struggling labor / Depression South Eastern Illinois / Just
              before the southern hills start / To roll toward the coal country /
              Where the east / west morainal ridges / Of Wisconsin trash pile up&hellip;.&quot;
            It's a great American poem in that it relates an unsettling geographic
            description of a people through the places they live and the work they
            do. It is also an indictment against the state on behalf of those
            people. &quot;Governments always conspire against / The population,&quot; he
              writes, &quot;and often / This is not even malice; / Just nothing better to
            do.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final stanza identifies his American tribe
              with &quot;every defiant nation this jerk / Ethnic crazy country bombs.&quot;
            Kurds, Serbs and Iraqis are a few of the countries he names. You get
            the idea. The enemy is this State, America, Europe, the Big Money guys
            and the Big Cancer Producers.</font></p>

          </blockquote>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This poem is a kind of testament, a final
              relation of where he stands against State proposals of land division,
            political economy, social engineering and ethnic chicanery. </font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dorn, following his teacher Charles Olson,
              engages in his work the world, rather than more domestic or local
              spaces. Poems in this collection like &quot;Tribe,&quot; continue this same level
            of engagement and revolt. In an interview several years ago in the <i>Chicago Review</i>, he said:</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ...there's a huge politic in Olson and a huge knowledge of it. With
                Oppen, those are small, pretty unpretentious, quite well-crafted
                objectivist poems, but they don't engage the world. They engage a
                personal, local reality. I think actually that's a Romantic inheritance
                insofar as it's personal. And all of the Objectivists actually are
              probably mini-Romantics in that sense. </font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With this commitment to the world over domestic and personal
              localities comes also a fierce and unyielding indictment and attack on
              the state and official state concepts. You might say with Dorn that
              everything mankind has accomplished since the late Paleolithic has been
              a mistake, particularly where agriculture and civilization are
            concerned. In the same interview, he said:</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&hellip;the fact is that the <i>Theogony</i> was a pastoral
                scene, with shepherds and nymphs and all the real life of a
                non-pernicious order. That is, there's no supra-national state; it just
              goes back to the hearth and, well, the real Romantic tie, actually.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">... ... ...</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then you get into the hideous thing that apparently will never
                go away, which is the rise of the state and the shifting of people off
                the land to the city which started then, and nevermore will people ever
                be left alone to do what, presumably, they ought to do. And they will
                be slaves forever, as they are now. Slavery simply shifts its terms. It
                never ends. There's one kind of slave that's black and came across on a
                ship, on a shelf, and there's another kind that was born in Manchester
              in 1710.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These words help frame for us the poem &quot;Tribe,&quot; which is a more
              condensed and sympathetic articulation. But the fuckery of state is
            central to his world engagement.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I think that the state is the most pernicious
              invention, after God, that man ever perfected,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm just
              against everything because I know it's bad. If it's proposed by
            mankind, then it's gotta be fucked. Which is not a politics, actually.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another poem in this collection, &quot;Chemo du Jour:
              The Impeachment on Decadron,&quot; shows how world engagement and state
            hatred can be articulated under chemotherapy.</font></p>

          </blockquote>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This visionary reading of world events is
              heightened by the altered physical state established by Taxol
              treatment. It's interesting to see how televised images are translated
              almost alchemically into spiritual or daemonic energies. It may be that
              any comment on the world is a religious or mythic one. It's certainly
              no longer a social one. The social would be those eroded structures
              that systematize Dorn's Taxol infusions. The famously cock-sucked
              president though is an image of a secular order of power in conflict or
              competition with the &quot;ruined Cradle of Civilization&quot; and the &quot;Celestial
              Light of public approval.&quot; There is a precision of seeing here, a
              visionary disorder that presents meaning along a vertical axis of
              perception and relation. The reception of chemicals and images affect
              the patient, one feeding the tumor while the other poisons it. By using
              the horrific accumulation of images in the oncology lab, Dorn
              transforms his environment to make a penetrating revelation of the
            world, as it is, through the screen or magazine photos.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other poems, like &quot;Linear Acceleration,&quot;
            continue to look at his condition with unflinching sincerity, seeking
            relations of meaning. It's not just a personal disease for Dorn, but an
            esoteric socio-ritual performance where Los Alamos and the volcanoes of
            Meso-America are linked in the topology of his treatment. Other poems
            are from direct, inner experiences with radiation blasting the &quot;seat of
            the soul.&quot; In &quot;Iodine Fire,&quot; he writes:</font></p>

          </blockquote>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's only fitting, I suppose, that this chilling
              documentary of disease should be so based in faith in the world. When
              to me there seems to be so little world left, that he could continue
              through cancer to interrogate those social and political relations is
              remarkable. That our world is reduced to an argument with a television
              on a table in an oncology ward is terrifying as the cells quickly
              spreading unchecked within the corruptible body. It is with profound
              effort that Dorn insisted on the world, on <i>a</i> world. For there
              was a world as long as a man like Dorn engaged it. That difference of
              engagement he mentions in himself and Oppen, of world address vs. local
              realities, is one that will be with us&mdash;with myself certainly&mdash;for a
              while. There is a tension between the fallible and the infallible,
              between the domestic range of the self and the greater communal
              phenomena of the world. If decline is its state, what is its terminus?
              And where did it begin? I'm not talking about a hunk of rock, but an
              ability to act within the confines of geographic or political space.
              The responsibility to and for the world is individual, a puritan
              polytheism. The terms love and hate are essential. Without them,
              certainly, there's nothing, for even hatred keeps the world from
