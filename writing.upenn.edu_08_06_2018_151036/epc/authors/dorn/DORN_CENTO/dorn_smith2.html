            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He grew up in Villa Grove--&quot;The
              Grave&quot; he would call it--a small town on the river Embarras in south
              central Illinois. Brown prairies and a blackbird sky informed his early
              imagination. That bleak geography demanded careful attention, hard work
              and grim determination from those whites whose settlements continued by
              habit and want to take from the land a meager living. Poverty made him
              self-conscious while the brute magnitude of the prairie turned his
              thoughts inward. His name in German meant &quot;thorn&quot;, a piercing spine
              protruding from the softer plant.</font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Largely self-taught, his education, according to
              his friend and biographer Tom Clark, consisted of &quot;the language and
              money theories of Ezra Pound, [Charles] Olson's far-reaching cultural
              projections [and] the subversive biophysics of Wilhelm Reich&quot;. With
              encouragement and a gift of $300 from a state college art teacher,
              Raymond Obermayr, he went east to North Carolina where he enrolled at
              Black Mountain College (1950-51) to study art, writing and
              anthropology. Charles Olson, recently back from the Yucat&aacute;n, lectured
              that semester on culture, man and history. </font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With no money for continued tuition, he returned
              to Illinois briefly, then thumbed his way west finding work at the
              Monroe Logging Co. in the Cascades 25 miles northeast of Seattle. His
              weekends were &quot;devoted to self-assigned studies,&quot; Clark writes.
  &quot;Economics, cultural anthropology and psychobiology now preoccupied
              him&quot;. For light reading he turned to Pound's <i>Guide to Kulchur</i>. </font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LeRoi Jones' Totem Press did not publish Edward Dorn's first book of poems, <i>The Newly Fallen</i>,
              until 1961. In that decade between his first semester at Black Mountain
              and the publication of his book he had married his first wife, Helene
              Helmers Dorn, returned to that unique North Carolina college, traveled
              unsuccessfully in Mexico, turned down graduate studies at Harvard and
              the University of Iowa's writer's workshop, befriended Robert Creeley,
              worked as a Greyhound bus baggage clerk with Allen Ginsberg in San
              Francisco, labored in Washington, New Mexico and Idaho and had written
              a novel of geographic preoccupation and economic ruin. </font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He worked a string of menial jobs until he was
              nearly forty years old, moving his family with persistent restlessness.
              This migrant worker-artist examined his life of difference from a
              position outside the comfortable, post-war spectacle of American social
              economy. Too polished for physical labor, too rough for a desk, Dorn
              and his young family endured the hardships and humiliations of poverty
              in the land of plenty. Only in middle age would he find employment
              performing &quot;casual labor&quot; as an adjunct or visiting faculty at a number
              of state universities.</font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ezra Pound noted that the study of literature is
              akin to hero worship. Edward Dorn's life should be read in such heroic
              terms, for he made from experience a penetrating and dissenting art.
              Heroes like Christ, or, as Dorn preferred, Hector, are models, examples
              of human perfection. The hero's life is a gage of sorts by which others
              can measure their own experiences of the world. The hero submits to
              impossible conditions to transform him or herself by absorbing
              experience, surmounting its intense obstacles to find private vision
              despite public or ideological pressures against doing so. </font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Out of the black dirt&quot; of Depression-era
              Illinois, Dorn &quot;scoured the ground of the earth&quot; to address the
              conditions of his impoverished birthright. By surviving the obstacles
              of poverty, and with the generous but humbling support of his wife's
              ex-husband, he perfected his imagination and study of the American
              West. His poetry became in time the record of resilient and hopeful
              discovery in a &quot;world of iron thorns&quot;. </font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A poet of multi-dimensional signaling,&quot; Clark
              writes, &quot;Dorn in his best poems typically offers apprehensions
              variously geological, geographical, cultural, social, historical,
              continuously interlaced.&quot; Also, &quot;for Dorn a geological or geographical
              idea about a landform variation cannot be separated from a historical
              idea about the cultural differences that landform variation makes&quot;.</font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dorn credited geographer Carl O. Sauer's 1925
              essay &quot;The Morphology of Landscape&quot; for &quot;instilling his own aspirations
              to an attentive, educated 'love of the formation of the land'&quot; and told
              an interviewer that love of landforms was &quot;superior to an aesthetic
              because it was like handling the constituents, the bones of America&quot;.
              Using Sauer's term Areal--&quot;(as of 'the associated or interdependent
              phenomena that make up an area')&quot;--Dorn's early prose novel <i>The Rites of Passage</i> and the poems in <i>The Newly Fallen</i> and <i>Geography</i> look to the areal conditions of landscape to inform the human dramas
              that take place within them. An unattributed quote from Sauer prefacing
              the long poem &quot;Idaho Out,&quot; according to Clark, &quot;announces the poem's
              immediate theme:&quot; &quot;The thing to be known is the natural landscape. It
              becomes known through the totality of its forms.&quot; In that poem &quot;areal
              is hopefully Ariel,&quot; the informing sprite of human condition. The pun
  &quot;now becomes areal = Ariel = aerial--three ways of fathoming space
              cleverly compacted into a triple homophone on which the poem pivots&quot;.</font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;By placing the forms of the earth (areal) at
              the center of one's writing&quot;, Clark continues, &quot;a writer may displace
              the function of the 'I' to the free imaginative play of the mind's eye
              (ariel): from this premise, contained in his critical play on words,
              Dorn develops in his more ambitious works of this period the active
              field of narrative distances and differences through which his writing
              freely ranges at play, tethered neither to the lonely ego that seems to
              hang back behind the singular diffident voice nor to the social forces
              against which that voice insistently poses itself in resistance&quot;.</font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tension and resistance recur in his work, but
              here in his early discoveries and disappointments, an &quot;'old
              hope'...instills Dorn's writing of these years with heart and spirit,
              the utopian signaling of a dream of freedom beyond resistance,
              annealing the old wounds of distance....&quot; </font></b></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clark met Dorn at the University of Essex in
              1965. They formed a close friendship and shared an enormous
              correspondence. So this biography is much more than a record of one
              man's heroic achievement. It's also an elegy written with great love
              for a friend. The epilogue makes that clear. There, Clark the
              chronicler steps aside, allowing the book to close with fragments from
              Dorn's final poems and letters. These address the grim condition of
              disease and coming death. Despite a flood of Decadron, the cancer
              originating in his pancreas (&quot;seat of the soul&quot;) invaded &quot;the 2nd
              Lumbar Region&quot;.</font></b></p>

            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The young, struggling Dorn of Clark's biography stands in stark contrast to the Dorn of the popular, ontological epic <i>Gunslinger</i>. This book--an admittedly incomplete biography--looks only with glances to the fierce, dissident poet of <i>Hello La Jolla</i> and <i>Abhorrences</i>.
              It examines instead the early, isolated years of Dorn's life in the
              West, leaving much of the remaining thirty for others to consider. This
              is the story of a young man in limited conditions learning complex
              arts. In that fragile hopefulness, heroic vision discovers the art
              apparent in the outline of forms. The particular and abstract meet, and
              for an instant condition relents to another, inspired, view.</font></b></p>
