            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spent six days with Dorn in March of 1999
                  and a few hours with him in Denver and Boulder eight months later,
                  three weeks before he died. I hadn't seen him since October of 1976
                  when I set up a reading for him at the University of Utah. I visited
                  him once in San Francisco, spent the night at his house in Chicago in
                  1971, and took four Dorn classes at Idaho State University between 1963
                  and 1965. I always opened his letters with the eagerness John Muir
                  would rush out of a tent during an earthquake in the Sierras with,
            certain that I was going to learn something.</font></p>
            <div class="node"><div class="content">
              <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edward Dorn was never my favorite poet. When I
                  was a student of his my favorite contemporary poets were Robert Creeley
                  and Philip Whalen. As I learned more about the subject, Robert Duncan
                  and Thomas McGrath became my favorites. When I met Dorn I had already
                  been familiar from the age of sixteen with the writer who will guide me
                  right off the face of the earth, Feodor Dostoevski. Among the first and
                  most enduring things I learned from Dorn was that it is possible to put
                  an emotional and dramatic narrative into a vernacular poem, rather than
                  in prose, and consequently leave out several thousand pages of he said,
                  she said. Up to that point I thought I wanted to be a novelist. From
                  that point on, I became a poet.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I still have the notion in our time that a poem
                  ought to make something clear as well as be beautiful,&quot; was the way
                  Dorn ended a review he published of W.S. Merwin's <i>The Moving Target</i> in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1964. I still like that notion. A poem ought to make something clear as well as be beautiful. </font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dorn was a great classroom teacher. He was a
                  chain smoker in the 1960s and brought a vivid intensity into the
                  seminar room. He harangued us vituperatively occasionally, once because
                  not a single poetry student had attended a lecture by a visiting
                  architect. &quot;Architects determine to a great degree what the built
                  environment is going to look like,&quot; he shouted. &quot;If poets don't care
                  what the world looks like, then who the hell will?&quot; </font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dorn made a diligent attempt to help every
                  student, to understand work that may very well have not been
                  understandable. He took seriously his description of himself: &quot;I am a
                  classical poet. My Gods have been men and women. I renew my demand that
                  presidents and chairmen everywhere be removed to a quarantine outside
                  the earth somewhere.&quot; Dorn believed and acted on the classical notion
                  that it was part of a poet's imperative to defend lost causes and
                  champion oppressed people.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've met very few people even remotely as well
                  informed as Edward Dorn. He read a wide variety of subjects with the
                  same depth and intensity with which he wrote and lived. He once said to
                  me, &quot;You never miss anything, do you,&quot; which I took to be a compliment
                  and part of the basis of our shared admiration. We also shared a
                  common, hardscrabble, rural background.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dorn never rested on his laurels, quite possibly
                  because there were very few to rest on. What were his laurels other
                  than a DH Lawrence Fellowship at the Lawrence Ranch in New Mexico,
                  where he did what, water the horses? and an American Book Award in 1980
                  plus an American Book Award for Lifetime Achievement, both from the
                  Before Columbus Foundation, neither containing any prize money. I could
                  give two awards a week if I don't have to fund them. I took flak from
                  Dorn himself for confusing the Lifetime Achievement Award from Before
                  Columbus with an NEA Lifetime Achievement Award, which actually comes
                  with $50,000, in the liner notes to <i>Pacific Northwestern Spiritual Poetry</i>.
                  He said he was used to the abuse. If you can bear to read the hundreds
                  if not thousands of poets substantially his inferior who have received,
                  as he never did, an NEA grant for creative writing, you may also be
                  learning the price of seriousness in an infotainment culture.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Am I entitled to guess that the &quot;genius&quot; grants
                  from the Insurance Foundation, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, will
                  be restricted to those writers who have sufficient genius to keep their
                  opinion of the insurance business to themselves?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The laurels that Dorn is getting away with is our attention. And by <i>our</i> I mean to include here, but not limit to, some of the places and people
                  that got stirred up and altered beyond former recognition by his
                  presence. There were 50-60 writers reading in March, 2000, in
                  Pocatello, Idaho, at the Rocky Mountain Writer's Festival including his
                  old and dear friend, the painter-poet Raymond Obermayr, the man who
                  suggested he bail out of the University of Illinois and check out Black
                  Mountain. Dorn was the chief instigator of the magazine <i>Wild Dog</i> and the prime creator of the enduring Pocatello scene in the first half
                  of the 1960s. Tom Raworth has eloquently testified on how Dorn
                  enlivened England when he went there for the first of his Fulbright
                  Fellowships in 1965 which bailed him out of Idaho State. I can feel
                  some of you thinking a Fulbright Fellowship is one type of laurel and
                  you are right. You'll be even more right when you realize he got those
                  fellowships, not because some American appreciated what Dorn had done
                  at that point, but because the Englishman and scholar Donald Davie
                  insisted that if the State Department send anybody to the University of
                  Essex, it be Edward Dorn, and not some more politically correct and
                  irrelevant substitute they were trying to palm off on them.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back from England, Dorn made deep impressions in
                  Chicago, inspiring among others, Al Simmons, the founder of what has
                  become the Taos Poetry Circus, which in their own humble words, bills
                  itself as the nation's premier literary festival. At Kent State
                  University, he stimulated to a penetrating degree, Ralph La Charity. In
                  Lawrence, Kansas, at the University, magazines like <i>Tansy</i> sprang up around his dynamic presence. </font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dorns toured Eastern Washington last March,
                  giving three readings in 72 hours in Walla Walla, Spokane and Pullman.
                  No one had ever done that before and it is unlikely to be repeated any
                  time soon. Dorn read three times in three days and never used any words
                  twice except &quot;and&quot; and &quot;the.&quot; The final reading at WSU was videotaped.
                  I put this fluky tour together and Dorn got paid at Eastern Washington
                  University in Spokane because his old friend, the novelist John Keeble,
                  happened to be chair of the Creative Writing Department there. He got
                  paid at Washington State in Pullman because Jim Elmborg, author of <i>A Pageant of Its Time: Gunslinger and the 60s</i>,
                  used to teach there. Dorn got paid in Walla Walla because I play tennis
                  with Tom Cronin and Dan Lamberton, the President of Whitman College and
                  the Director of the Humanities Program at Walla Walla College
                  respectively.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dorn taught for twenty years at the University of Colorado at Boulder where he and Jennifer Dunbar Dorn published <i>Rolling Stock</i>,
                  a magazine of eclectic cultural sanity. Another example of the laurels
                  accorded to Edward Dorn is provided by the treatment he received from
                  the University of Colorado during his fatal illness. Dorn was diagnosed
                  with pancreatic cancer after having taught for eighteen and a half
                  years. He was appropriately given a year's sick leave, appropriate
                  because more than a third of the victims of pancreatic cancer don't
                  survive a year after diagnosis. But Dorn was plucky and did survive as
                  another third of the victims of pancreatic cancer do. Comes the end of
                  his year of sick leave and the bean counters at the University discover
                  he has only taught for nineteen and a half years. In order to be
                  eligible for his pension, which he had been paying into all that time,
                  the university insisted that he return to teaching for another six
                  months.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isn't that a wonderful academic touch, to prop
                  up a nearly dead poet scarecrow fashion in front of his classes to make
                  the digital requirements of their pension system pencil out?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd like to suggest at least one reason among
                  many why Dorn has acquired the laurels of our, also unfunded,
                  attention. Dorn's approach to poetry, unlike many of his more famous
                  and more useless, more highly rewarded colleagues in the general
                  concept movement of postmodernism, was dynamic rather than static. The
                  typical postmodern poet arrived at a style that got him or her the
                  requisite attention. They then proceeded to repeat variations of it
                  indefinitely as if style were more significant than substance. Dorn's
                  style changed with the pressures of his environment as a vivid response
                  to altered circumstances. It is possible to hear the changes in his
                  dynamic style from the early lyrics and didactic odes through the
                  dramatic narrative repartee of <i>Gunslinger</i> to the pithy satiric epigrams of <i>Abhorrences</i> and on to the multidimensional approach in <i>Langue d'Oc Variorum</i>.
                  I share Tom Clark's belief that this later work, when finally assembled
                  and published in toto, will generate as much interest and praise as
                  Gunslinger already has.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Changing styles dynamically can be fatal to the
                  marketing of art. But for us it represents the triumph of process over
                  product: one voice, many tones and manners. Style is a necessary
                  component of art, but it is not the reason for its existence. Substance
                  trumps style.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I feel blessed to have known Dorn and his work,
                  even as imperfectly and sporadically as I did. Dorn made a difference
                  in American life. From 1974 when he first suggested it, we had been
                  desultorily planning to do a tour of the Olde West together. Since that
                  won't be happening, it appears I have been and will be making that tour
                  indefinitely with others and by myself. </font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I took a long slow train ride with Dorn on the
                  Portland Rose in 1964, from Pocatello to Portland and back, to attend
                  an academic clambake known as Northwest Manuscript Day at the
                  University of Oregon in Eugene. The beautiful secretary of the ISU
                  English Department, whose name after nearly forty years has escaped me,
                  met us at the Pocatello depot with a six pack of beer and a sack of
                  homemade sandwiches to get our trip off on the right lovely note. We
                  watched elk feed out of the domeliner as it slid across the Blue
                  Mountains and rattled through the Columbia Gorge, its greenery
                  interspersed with waterfalls.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Eugene event itself was a field day for
                  high-toned establishment poets to ridicule the original work of youth,
                  a fitting introduction to official &quot;Northwest&quot; poetry. We met mel
                  buffington and Ron Bayes from La Grande in Eugene and that was the
                  beginning of a fine alliance with the genuine poets of Oregon. Dorn
                  also read in Edward Van Alysteyn's living room, one of the editors of <i>Coyote's Journal</i>. <i>CJ</i> was the magazine created to accommodate the work that had just been
                  driven off the U of O campus as the editors had gotten sacked from
                  their positions at <i>The Northwest Review</i>. The issue that got
                  them in trouble with the Christian legislature for taking the Lord's
                  name in vain, had work by Oregon native, Philip Whalen of The Dalles,
                  some Charles Bukowski, and a translation of the undoubtable Antonin
                  Artaud's &quot;<i>Pour En Finir Avec Le Judgment de Dieu</i>,&quot; or &quot;To Have
                  Done With the Judgment of God.&quot; Is there anything as valuable and
                  rambunctious as Whalen, Bukowski or Artaud currently being published
                  with funding from the legislatures of the Northwest in their pitiful
                  universities? These legislators will be the last people to escape the
                  judgment of God.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last time I saw Dorn his body had desiccated
                  to angelic consistency. He couldn't have weighed more than 80 pounds.
                  His hair was very blonde. He chose his words carefully and spoke with
                  effort. We trouped to the movies in a Brazil-like cinema in downtown
                  Denver and returned to the Dorn's living room with take-out pizza.
                  Reluctant to leave, I said a common thing, &quot;I'll see you later.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When?&quot; he asked immediately.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The next time I come to town.&quot;</font></p>
