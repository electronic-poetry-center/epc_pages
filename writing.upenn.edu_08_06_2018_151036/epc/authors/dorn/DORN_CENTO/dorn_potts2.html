            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no longer any where to resist the reading of <i>Gunslinger</i> from. In <i>&quot;A Pageant of Its Time&quot;: Edward Dorn's Slinger and the Sixties</i>, James K. Elmborg has written a very good book explicating a great poem. Elmborg's claim in his preface that &quot;I think <i>Gunslinger</i> is perhaps the most important poem of the last half of the twentieth
              century...(xii),&quot; is here repeated and restated for the purpose of
              removing the &quot;perhaps.&quot; The only poems on this scale with which <i>Gunslinger</i> can be usefully compared are Thomas McGrath's <i>Letter to an Imaginary Friend</i>, and Sharon Doubiago's <i>Hard Country</i>. Elmborg's <i>Metahodos</i>, as they say in Black Mountain Speak, is to correlate the composition of <i>Gunslinger</i> to Dorn's essential grounding in the social and economic reality of his
              understood surroundings. This very useful practice permits generous and
              mystery popping insights into passages hitherto misunderstood by
              critics and casual readers. &quot;The poem's subject is nothing less than
              the survival of intellect and moral integrity in the postmodern world&quot;
              (105), according to Elmborg. It is a worthy subject for the greatest
              long poem in American literature.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alongside the contexualization of the various time periods and locations where Dorn lived as he wrote the four books of <i>Gunslinger </i>plus
              the section called &quot;The Cycle,&quot; Elmborg surveys a substantial portion
              of the published critiques of the poem. Elmborg builds and extends
              those opinions he finds useful and offers insight into those he finds
              mistaken or lacking. An extensive bibliography of &quot;Works Cited&quot; on <i>Gunslinger</i> is included and it is apparent that interest in the poem is reaching
              critical mass. This scholarly aspect of the work provides a pertinent
              starting point for further inquiries. The poem has been admitted into
              the literature, if reluctantly in some quarters. The work now, as
              always, is to locate the poem's maximal audience.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Elmborg begins his inquiry with a &quot;Preface&quot;
              where he registers his opinion of the poem's importance, and an
  &quot;Introduction&quot; in which he very wisely locates the &quot;...1960s as that
              period from roughly 1965 to 1974--...&quot; (1). Ten year periods, decades
              of unitary social significance, have rarely in this century conformed
              to the literal decade, ie 1960-1969. Even though &quot;Dorn took up a
              position stubbornly outside mainstream culture&quot; (5), <i>Gunslinger</i> was in fact received enthusiastically from the beginning, at least by
              people who have given Dorn's poetry the fine attention truly original
              writing deserves. By the time the complete composition was first
              published by Wingbow, the encomiums included Thomas McGuane's &quot;<i>Gunslinger</i> is a fundamental American Masterpiece,&quot; and Robert Duncan's &quot;Let me be among those who acclaim <i>Gunslinger</i> as one of <i>the </i>poems of the era, of the one we are going into, or the era <i>Gunslinger</i> begins to create for us.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This sense from Duncan that the poem begins to
              create a new era for us will eventually become apparent to everyone and
              the issue of the establishment's or the academy's equally stubborn
              refusal to acknowledge the poem and recognize the new era itself will
              be taken up later. Elmborg's &quot;Pageant,&quot; a six chapter book with notes,
              index and bibliography, considers the work in chronological sequence.
              Chapter one, &quot;Between Here and Formerly,&quot; takes for its title, as do
              the other chapters, succinct lines of poetry from the text of the poem.
              Elmborg applies his intended method of correlating the poem to its
              social and historical era, first to the Dorn poetry that preceded
              Gunslinger, on his way to writing what &quot;...might be described as a
              biography of the poem&quot; (xii). Dorn's career can be viewed in
              approximately three components, pre-<i>Gunslinger</i>, <i>Gunslinger</i>, and post-<i>Gunslinger</i>. Throughout the stylistic development, Dorn has not wobbled on his pivot. &quot;While <i>Gunslinger</i> seems in many ways radically different from Dorn's previous poetry, it grows naturally from his earlier career. <i>Gunslinger</i> is neither intensely personal nor overtly political, but it does employ the Western motifs of <i>Hands Up!,</i> the geographical method of &quot;The Land Below&quot; and <i>Geography</i>, and an awareness of the systems of language and power that Dorn explores in <i>North Atlantic Turbine</i>&quot; (16). Elmborg also points out that the terminal poem in <i>North Atlantic Turbine</i>, &quot;An Idle Visitation,&quot; is in fact a version of the opening sequence of <i>Gunslinger</i>,
              which contains the literal signal of the enhanced attitude: &quot;I have no
              wish to continue/ my debate with men&quot; (5). A &quot;tectonic&quot; shift has
              occurred and <i>Gunslinger</i> is the result.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be tedious in a brief review to discuss
              the tremendous insights in each chapter of Elmborg's text. His methods
              are sound. From a combination of a close and since close, sympathetic
              and enthusiastic reading of the text, with quotes from Dorn's
              interviews and other occasions when Dorn responded to questions about
              the poem, with generous references to the locations and social
              circumstances of the poem's composition, and further with the
              aforementioned survey of the other correct and incorrect critical
              responses to the poem, Elmborg makes a very strong case for the
              immediate admission of this poem into the canon of great literature.
              Elmborg is at his most useful in elucidating &quot;The Cycle,&quot; in
              correlating the circumstances at Lawrence, Kansas, to the poem, and at
              documenting the shifts in attitude from one book to the next of the
              poem itself, for <i>Gunslinger</i>, like all great literature, manifests a dynamic engagement with its circumstances, rather than a static one.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A great treat awaits those who are yet ignorant of <i>Gunslinger</i>. Elmborg has a good time discussing the attempts that have been made to place <i>Gunslinger</i> in a genre. Is the poem comic opera, comedy, an anti-epic, an allegory,
              mock-epic, or a romance. It is all and none of the above. These futile
              attempts to pigeonhole a work that breaks down categories, defies
              authority and reduces if not eliminates distinctions are themselves
              somewhat comical. Literature exists outside the university English
              Departments. While some of it is there being routinely contaminated
              with redundant exegesis, literature's more permanent repose is the
              minds of people willing to have their states elevated and their
              intellects instructed while their emotions are assuaged and purged.
              Obviously a single great poem cannot break the university monopoly on
              irrelevance, but <i>Gunslinger</i> is certainly one of the ones that
              is having that unintentional effect. It is also, for the record, the
              greatest contribution to civilization made on cocaine since Sigmund
              Freud's <i>The [Mis]Interpretation of Dreams</i>.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to travel to the end of the poem with
              its merry band of travelers, it is necessary to come into the poem on
              the right wave length. From up here on the mesa where <i>Gunslinger</i> has lifted us, the verse works like capillary action. Which way was
              that preposition going? Who put the squeeze on you now? The comedic
              effect is achieved and its valence is determined by the sheer
              differential of the perspective. It is not necessary that comedy be
              light or dark. It can be heavy and light handed simultaneously.
            Shakespeare's best &quot;tragic&quot; plays are and so is <i>Gunslinger</i>. Its effects are transformational rather than transcendental. </font></p>

            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order for a poem to be an epic, something heroic has to take place. In the case of <i>Gunslinger</i>,

              poem is &quot;I.&quot; &quot;I&quot; plays a role not unlike that of the straight man who
              keeps asking questions that the answers to are more or less already

              by Robart (the <i>Gunslinger</i> transmorgrification of the historical

              putting &quot;I&quot; into suspended animation for most of the poem resulted in
              the &quot;ego&quot; function being dispersed into many other characters. Pound
              and Olson compose largely in a monotone from a single enlightened
              perspective and the result too often is monotonous political cant,
              however righteous, and not poetry. The salubrious effect of Dorn's
              inspiredly different approach is the delivery of the poetry from many
              competing perspectives, much as in a great Shakespeare play with its
              many talking heads as contrasted with the dreadfully dull Miltonic

              Versions of Place in the Poetry of Charles Olson, Edward Dorn, and
              Theodore Enslin,&quot; is a high quality piece of criticism. He nails
              several of the essential Olson limitations, some of which can be found
              in Olson's preoccupation with Jung, and the pathological degeneration
              of Olson's mythos regarding the relationships between male and female,
              man and woman. &quot;The explanation lies, I think, in Olson's increasing
              tendency simply to collapse the personal, the local, and the
              historical.&quot; It could also be the degenerative effects of a Catholic
              propadeuticism.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hatlen under the influence of much classical backgrounding, persistently insists that <i>Gunslinger</i> is a mock-epic, a term he may not find pejorative, but it is. He claims
  &quot;...the effect is to dissolve all epic certainties in a corrosive bath
              of irony.&quot; I'm willing to acknowledge the poem giving us a bath in
              corrosive irony, but if ever a culture deserved to be linguistically
              eviscerated, this is it. I've read enough epics to know that certainty
              is not one of the things they left me with. <i>Gunslinger</i>,
              referred to above as an example of realism, leaves you on the street
              alone in a vicious system at the mercy of such friends and other
              arrangements as you can make. This truth, being the truth, is the most
              useful kind of certainty. I'll take Hatlen on Enslin at face value.
              Hatlen admits that what he misses in Dorn and Enslin is &quot;a sense of the
              possibility of a <i>politics</i> that might allow us to act within a
              public scene, in our historical moment.&quot; Could anyone possibly be
              getting or ever require such a sense of politics from a close reading
              of Shakespeare? Hatlen seems in fact to be lamenting the absence of
              Olson's most crippling limitation: the notion that there could ever be
              a politics that would resemble a solution.</font></p>

              people completely in the dark. Jenkins' &quot;Ethics of Excess&quot; apparently
              written while he was a student, (it is well known what being a student
              can do to de-arrange a mind) is confused and too heavily laden with
              extraneous references to be of much use. To have his ideas taken
              seriously they will need to be detoxified, as in a book length
              Chomskian treatment where the juice would probably not be worth the
              squeeze. &quot;Dorn breaks a great, unwritten rule of narrative: consistent
              character names.&quot; I thought consistency was the hemoglobin of bleeding
              harts. Inconsistent character names do not diminish the work of
              Dostoevsky. It's only a typo, but reference is made in Jenkins' essay
              to Dr. Flamboyant's &quot;Turning Machine.&quot; It's cited more accurately if
              incompletely in the &quot;Annotations&quot; at page 135, line 20 as a &quot;Turing
              Machine,&quot; so at least the double entendre on &quot;tour&quot; is maintained. A
              turning machine sounds like a railroad roundhouse or a rotisserie
              rather than a model for computer simulation. In his Coda, Jenkins
              writes, &quot;I cannot end this essay without qualifying or unsaying some of
              my statements about the ethic in Gunslinger.&quot; &quot;Unsay?&quot; How about
              re-write? Isn't that why Dorn referred to Universities, among other
              places, as natural centers of double talk.</font></p>
