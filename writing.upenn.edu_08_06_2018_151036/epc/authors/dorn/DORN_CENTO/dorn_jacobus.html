            <p align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Ed Dorn and his wife Jennifer Dunbar
        Dorn entered my life, a major shot of life-long adrenalin penetrated
        myself and the Chicago atmosphere. Although Ed's Chicago years
        (1970,1971) are rarely recorded, these were hard core developmental
        years in national and local American history with an impact that I
        personally considered nuclear or new-clear. Chicago had just suffered
        through the Democratic National Convention havoc in 1968. Martin Luther
        King was killed, Bobby Kennedy was killed and the Chi-town air lingered
        with the stench of the ongoing conflict in Vietnam. On the other side
        of this coin was that the counter-culture was still in latent bloom
        although in Chicago it felt like a semi-arid wasteland with no
        particular direction. When Ed and Jenny first hit town I recorded a
        small two line description about the initial affect of their presence.
        It was simply entitled &quot;Ed Dorn New Year&quot;          </font></b></p>

      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ed was hired by University professor and
        playwright Alan Bates. It was a pure hire that struck an amazing
        target, giving alignment and purpose to some floundering students who
        were fooling around with poetry either as personal therapy or an
        expression of emotions that wouldn't allow &quot;the voices&quot;to die.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jennifer Dunbar Dorn added to the glorious
        energy. Jenny had her own unique intensity. She was high strung,
        attractive and a talented writer herself, plus she was English complete
        with a <i>real</i> English accent. When we discovered her brother John
        Dunbar was married to Marianne Faithfull and operated the Indica
        gallery and book shop where John Lennon first met Yoko Ono (who was
        putting on one of her avant garde shows there) we were in ecstasy.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jenny's connection that close to the Beatles,
        coupled with Ed's poetic fervor was an amazing bit of cosmic karma
        thrown in our Midwest laps. As students, it was like getting the Krell
        Mind boost. A genius alien race found in a classic sci-fi movie
        entitled <i>Forbidden Planet</i>.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rather than wonder what a working poet was,
        other than print in a student's text book, here was a poet who not only
        instructed but gave readings of his work, read incredibly and wrote
        brilliantly. Ed was a more than a teacher, he was a guide. To me he was
        an aristocratic technician with language and thought. And was the
        fastest on the word-thought trigger as anyone I ever knew.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remember forcing my way into Ed and Jenny's
        space when I first stopped at the 911 club, the nicknamed address of
        the brick two flat they lived in on Diversey Avenue, located on
        Chicago's Northside. Many amazing parties happened there accented with
        great dialogues, personalities and chemistry, as Ed brought in poets
        from throughout the country and abroad. Anselm Hollo, Robert Creeley,
        Anne Waldman, Tom Raworth, Philip Whalen, J. H. Prynne and Ted
        Berrigan, just to name a few. We couldn't have received a better
        creative writing education at Harvard or Yale. In fact in my opinion Ed
        and Jenny put us ahead of the game because as students we were reading
        books and living an Urban Carlos Castaneda existence that tapped our
        Unconscious for future reference. So for a brief flash in time an
        English Black Mountain had settled on the plains and if you payed
        attention it was quite a combination.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Ed and Jenny left Northeastern University
        in the early 70's we stayed in touch and I followed them throughout
        their many travels and homes. From Mexico to Kent State, from San
        Francisco to Healdsburg and La Hoya California with many varied stops
        in between, finally settling and raising their family in Boulder at the
        University of Colorado in 1977, where Ed became a tenured professor and
        eventually head of the Graduate MFA program.</font></b></p>

One issue published my report on
        the first poetry &quot;bouts&quot;held in Chicago in 1981. Discovered by another
        of Ed's students and &quot;Stone Wind Poet&quot; Al Simmons, this article started
        a chain reaction of National Poetry &quot;Main Events&quot; (competitions) that
        became the premier attraction at the Taos, New Mexico Poetry Circus and
        was a blueprint for what eventually evolved into the culture of Slam
        performance poetry. Not that Ed or Jenny enjoyed or artistically
        approved the &quot;silliness&quot;of such competitions, it was just that their
        publishing of this small report was at the root of a performance poetry
        movement that sweeps up the youth involved in the poetry world today.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had the good fortune to hear Ed read from many of his books countless times, once reading the whole of <i>Gunslinger</i> in Evanston, Illinois sponsored by Northwestern University. He blew the roof off the place.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Talk about writing and performance, Ed was the
        ultimate example that truly great work can perform itself on the page
        or in the listener's ear. Ed was a master of both. He was impeccable
        with the short poem or the long. He was Academy and Street. Blue Collar
        and White World. R &amp; B and Classics. Funk and Funny. Poetic
        Journalist or Political sharpshooter. A pro that could take the poetic
        ball and do whatever he wanted with it. His readings were always
        intelligent, entertaining, instructive and accessible. He could change
        the atmosphere of a room.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like all of us on Earth, Ed was not a perfect
        angel. He couldn't put up with mediocrity and he could cut or nail you
        to the core with a line or a look. He was a word chemist who at times
        may have seen his students as experiments that he could observe in his
        mental lab. But that just came with the territory. An what a manifest
        destiny it was.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/taos"><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/dorn/DORN_CENTO/jacobus_files/thumb_taos-94.jpeg" align="left" /></a>The
        last time I saw Ed and Jenny was in Taos, in 1997. He was giving a
        reading of his new work at the Taos Poetry Circus. You could see he was
        drained but he still read elegantly. A true poet- warrior till the end.
        I also had the good fortune to include excerpts and poems from his most
        recent work in a Taos poetry anthology entitled <i>Taos Poetry Circus: The Nineties</i>.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Ed died the poetry world truly lost a
        cultural anchor. A truer mentor I could not have experienced in my
        wildest dreams. In my opinion he was and is one of the best poets of
        the past century. A Bernard Malamud's Roy Hobbs of the written word,
        with Jenny's steadfast backing, partnership and support. They will
        always remain immaculate inspirations.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of that inspiration deposited itself into
        my &quot;Memory Banks&quot;--recollections of interactions with Ed over the years
        that continue to consistently pay spiritual dividends. Here are a few

        smashed a bottle of whiskey into a wall in a bar and lit a match to it,

        coming back down to finish the film. But they never did. So after ten

        Poetic times were tense because of certain polorizations that existed
        between what could be considered at the time two factions in poetic

        an early sixties western. With Newman riding shotgun on a stagecoach
        that was ambushed and the passengers robbed, humiliated, raped and left
        there most likely to die. Newman took up the responsibility of
        attempting to get them through the tough hostile countryside. When
        asked by one of the soft East Coast passengers why they should trust
        their lives to him. Newman, as Hombre responded, &quot;Cause I can cut it
        lady.&quot;</font></b></p>

      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There were hundreds of memory bank moments that
        occurred with Ed and Jenny throughout the years; playing guitar at
        their parties, shooting pool with Ed in one of the classic Chicago
        parlors that has since been torn down, (once I ran the table in two
        consecutive eight ball games on him and we immediately switched to
        playing billiards where he totally kicked my ass.) Then there was
        tennis in Boulder, trekking to Newtown in Chicago to buy the Allman
        brothers' &quot;Live at the Fillmore East,&quot; album, listening and dancing
        away our troubles in their living room on a Chicago summer's
        afternoon...</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just a couple of weeks before Ed died, I called
        Jenny when I experienced some spontaneous spiritual ballast. It felt
        like thought tentacles reaching and pulling me across the grey November
        sky. Jenny said Ed was pretty bad and it wouldn't be long. I was
        shocked, trying to prepare myself for the inevitable that happens to us
        all. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I never ascribe to the practice of writing
        post-mortem poems about poets when they, as &quot;the cliche&quot; says, pass on,
        but in Ed's case I just had to let out my personal grief in words on a
        page. My gut thinks Ed despised this practice but I had to do it
        anyway. And my gut also tells me Ed would question or devour me for the
  &quot;grand scheme&quot; of my expression in the piece that he put his guns down.

        dimension wherein they reside.</font></b></p>
