            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Twenty of Edward Dorn&rsquo;s final poems largely
              on the subject matter of his life with pancreatic cancer post the
              diagnosis in 1997 until his death on December 10th, 1999, are hereby
              letter pressed onto Mohawk paper for your delectation and esthetic
              edification. Understandably bitter and vitriolic, Dorn never lost any
              of his sharp edges, announcing once during a reading in March of 1999
            that &quot;My problem is how to make pain funny.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Laughter is elixir for the immune system and
              whether or not Dorn&rsquo;s elaborate sense of humor prolonged his life, it
              certainly informed his writing as in &quot;Chemo du Jour: The Impeachment on
              Decadron,&quot; for which he won one of the few prizes of his life from <i>The Denver Quarterly</i> where it was first published: &quot;&hellip;Forget <i>Acquittal</i> / or quitting of any kind--&lsquo;I entered, / but I never came.&rsquo;&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Dorn goes over his personal selections--or
              those selected personally for him, from or at the terminus of what he
              called &quot;the well-worn path to the Apothecary,&quot; the route of this
              civilization if it is going anywhere, it is clearly out of its mind--he
              has time to drop back to his origins in the marvelous poem &quot;Tribe.&quot;
              Here not only is his contempt for the misuse of power re-established,
  &quot;Governments always conspire against / The population and often / This
              is not even malice; / Just nothing better to do,&quot; it is justly included
              with a fine salute to &quot;My grandfather French Quebecois / Master
              pipefitter in the age of steam.&quot; Only the deaf could miss this crisply
              loving music. In a fine audio compilation by Anselm Hollo of Dorn&rsquo;s
              reading from his satirical verse, &quot;Tribe&quot; is also recited within a few
              months of his death. Dorn&rsquo;s voice breaks with emotion and will make
              believers of more than his acolytes that &quot;&hellip;it would take more paper /
              Than I&rsquo;ll ever have to express how justified I feel.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The justification on the other hand of the
              environmentally induced cancer plague and epidemic, affecting many
              poets and millions of other people, will take more paper and brains
              than commercial and political apologists will ever be able to
              expropriate. Our common chemical fate is all too frequently in other&rsquo;s
              hands. Being right won&rsquo;t make us well directly though and since Dorn
              apparently recognized the pancreas as the seat of the soul, the
              possibility remains that some of his vitriol leaked into his soul.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Blasting his enemies, those whom he can feel
              carrying unconscious intentions to make his cancer grow, &quot;with a beam /
              Of my centrifugal silence / In the flow of the taxodiaceae,&quot; Dorn goes
              out swinging. Anyone reading a lot of the poetry being published for
              the first time in contemporary America could readily get the impression
              that most of it consists of the oblique parries, feints and thrusts of
              thinly disguised career moves on the not so hallowed battleground of
              what Bly has condemned as the 256 extant MFA programs. The fact that
              Dorn was operating under a death sentence against the low signal to
              noise ratio of the background radiation, his career about to be
              foreshortened in a screeching halt, gives the work a riveting attention
              getting quality general plaints on malaise can never achieve.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prayer, as if we had one, qualities of the final poem in <i>Chemo S&aacute;be</i>,
  &quot;The Garden of the White Rose&quot; where &quot;mercy is stretched so thin&quot; are
              plaintive in their evocation. The book has a lovely cover created by
              his old friend Ray Obermayr. What if the makers of Prilosec got ahold
              of this text. Could we be so lucky that they&rsquo;d sue for defamation of
              product? Dorn, a demanding poet for demanding readers, demands in &quot;The
              Dull Relief of General Pain--Oxycontin, Roxicodone and Codeine in
              General:&quot; &quot;What&rsquo;s going on? This is poetry calling! / Poetry is waiting
              for an answer.&quot;</font></p>
