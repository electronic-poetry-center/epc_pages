            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>From 1956 to 1959 the poet Edward Dorn (1929-1999)
        dwelt with his family &ndash; his first wife Helene Helmers, their son Paul,
        and Helene&rsquo;s two children by a previous marriage, Fred and Chansonette
  &ndash; in Burlington, Washington. In these years Dorn worked at a
        bewildering variety of casual-labor jobs, meanwhile struggling to make
        his mark as a writer. From this period date most of the poems in his
        first collection, <i>The Newly Fallen</i> (1961), as well as the groundwork of his novel <i>The Rites of Passage</i> (1965; later reissued as <i>By the Sound</i>).</b></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> New Years Eve Carl took Mary downtown for a glass of beer&hellip;. Mary turned
          once to find herself being stared at by the man on the next stool&hellip;. He
          said, You&rsquo;re Canadian. She replied, No, I&rsquo;m not&hellip;. [He] asked more
          questions and was generally skeptical of the couple&rsquo;s local residence.
          To him they remained Canadian. This word, along the coast from Blaine
          to Seattle, is commonly used to mean odd ball.<br />
          <i>-- The Rites of Passage</i> </font></b></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The marks of the Dorns&rsquo; difference were
        easily noticeable if not always readily identifiable: &quot;Canadian,&quot; as
        Fred Buck notes, meant &quot;weird and poor&quot; to the family&rsquo;s middle-class
        Burlington neighbors. In his writings of this time Dorn not only
        refused to conceal the evidence of their strangeness but took pains to
        flaunt it. In one of his most telling poems of the Skagit Valley stay,
  &quot;The Argument Is,&quot; he adopted this against-the-grain strategy,
        perversely locating value in one set of distinguishing signs of
        material deprivation. In this poem the children&rsquo;s second-hand clothing
        is worn as &quot;a secret burden&quot; in the double sense, both as a social
        emblem of shame weighing them down and as a reverse badge of honor,
        declaring their innocence of &quot;the ways of society&quot; (and thus freeing
        them from responsibility for its complex injustices). The poem shows
        Dorn&rsquo;s &quot;political&quot; thinking at its nontheoretical concrete best,
        revealing an empirical truth about life in the sociological &quot;basement
        stratum&quot; &ndash; where, paradoxically, the only true grace, a careless,
        casually-fitting castoff or &quot;stolen&quot; freedom, is to be found.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Helene confirms the scene of the poem is
        Burlington, and that it is &quot;definitely &lsquo;true to life.&rsquo;&quot; &quot;Not sure who
        the little girl is,&quot; says Fred Buck, &quot;possibly my sister.&quot;</font></b></p>

        dressing weird (Goodwill clothes etc.) and one of the taunts I got from
        neighborhood kids was literally &lsquo;Poor!!&rsquo; Poor was weird then and weird
        usually meant poor, and as Ed wrote somewhere in the novel, weird and
        poor was also tagged &lsquo;Canadian.&rsquo; So we were all of those and in
        isolation in so many ways in those Burlington years, not part of the
        town, hanging with the other weirds like Norma and Gordon in their pea
        shack, John the wino singing to us &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you a rainbow&rsquo; so sweetly
        and drunkenly, &lsquo;202&rsquo; and his toothless wife and their ragbag kids
        roaring up to our house in their banged up car and raising cain and
        roaring away again. True people and friends in the weirdness all melted
        away to whatever future we&rsquo;ll never know, but still in our heads and
        hearts and Ed&rsquo;s writing, bless him.&quot;</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fellow &quot;weirds&quot; Fred Buck refers to were to
        become key figures in the basement-stratum landscape depicted in Dorn&rsquo;s
        narratives of this period. Norma and Gordon appear in <i>The Rites of Passage</i> as James, a &quot;desperately poor&hellip; flunky carpenter&quot; with a drinking habit,
        and his equally hard-drinking wife Ramona, an Eskimo from Nome with a
        radiant smile. In the chapter called &quot;The Difference,&quot; the struggles of
        this couple, shack-dwellers in a local migrant-laborers&rsquo; &quot;pea-camp,&quot;
        provide Dorn salient evidence of the multiple effects of class and race
        exclusion; particularly impressive is his drawing of the ironic
        contradictions of Ramona&rsquo;s character, candidly posing her &quot;low&quot; habits
        and qualities against her natural dignity and aspirations to a decent
        life. &quot;202&quot; &ndash; &quot;no idea what his real name was, we called him &lsquo;202&rsquo;
        because he had a bumpersticker on his car saying Vote no (or yes?) on
        202 [a union-busting &lsquo;right-to-work&rsquo; bill],&quot; says Fred &ndash; became another
        of the novel&rsquo;s main characters, Billy Hendersson, a temperamental,
        independent-minded hard-hat whose irrational explosiveness affords him
        a way to temporarily break out of the System, but also assures him
        trouble wherever he turns. Another case-study in ironic contradictions,
        this character figures in several pivotal scenes (in chapters &quot;The
        Unemployment Office,&quot; &quot;By the River,&quot; &quot;The Deer,&quot; and &quot;The Tunnel&quot;) as
        a latter-day manifestation of the frontier temperament now reduced to a
        self-destructive anachronism. (Billy/&quot;202&quot; also makes a cameo
        appearance as &quot;Fletcher&quot; in &quot;Notes About Working and Waiting Around.&quot;)</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presenting &quot;odd ball&quot; images of scarcity amid
        excess, delineating scenes of actual poverty calculated to expose and
        undermine the easy assumptions of the Age of Affluence, it is little
        wonder Dorn found himself doomed to occupy a tenuous position in
        relation to the mainstream mass-market literary audience of the late
        1950s and early 1960s. The very names of the ephemeral journals in
        which his writings were now beginning to appear &ndash; <i>Between Worlds, Migrant, The Outsider</i> (where both &quot;Like a Message on Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Argument Is&quot; would first see the light), <i>Wild Dog</i> (his own mimeograph magazine, done from Idaho) &ndash; bespeak this marginal
        stance. The characters of Dorn&rsquo;s writings of that era before the birth
        of the &quot;counterculture&quot; live out an edgy outcast/outlaw ethos; the
        lyric-realist graces of those writings seem &quot;stolen,&quot; both in the sense
        that they must be stealthy (such is the outlaw attitude) and in the
        sense that they represent fugitive moments, precious time taken away
        from the central basement-stratum business of putting food on the table.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fred Buck has a vivid recollection of casual
        food-gathering banditry undertaken with other children near &quot;the pea
        factory where the peas Norma [Ramona] picked got trucked to. My friends
        and I would wait at an intersection up the street for the pea trucks to
        come by and slow down for the turn then grab a handful of vines off the
        truckbed. Good Eating! Sweet as candy. I guess they ended up in cans or
        birdseyed when they got to where they were intended.&quot; The sweetest of
        forbidden fruits, furtive pleasures &quot;stolen, / from the wealth / of the
        nation,&quot; poems like &quot;The Argument Is&quot; were to my own generation (I
        started reading Dorn in 1959, as a college student) a secret
        sustenance, plucked fresh from a little-known writer&rsquo;s surprising and
        nourishing candor in an otherwise barren cultural moment.</font></b></p>
