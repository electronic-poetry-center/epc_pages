                <p align="justify" class="centoinfo"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ed Dorn was poet-in-residence at Northeastern
                  Illinois University from 1970-1972, where he was influential in
                  inspiring many of the writers in Chicago who are working at poetry
                  today, myself among them. He returned in October 1991 to give a reading
                  to a packed room (standing room only!) and to much applause.</font></p>

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> My life at the University of
                  Illinois preceding that had been pretty confused and not focused, so
                  going to Black Mountain didn't help the confusion much, but it
                  certainly made me focused. In fact, the confusion only increased. Black
                  Mountain was really good for confusing you. It was the dying embers of
                  a once-great educational experiment. There would be lots of ways of
                  characterizing it, but an intellectual adventure was what it was for
                  me, and I hadn't had one.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> So it came at the right time in the development of your intellect?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I think so, yes. I was in my mid
                  20's. A bit late, in that sense, but it wasn't going to happen earlier
                  than that. I just learned about it because I didn't have those kind of
                  connections to know about a place like Black Mountain. But when I think
                  of Black Mountain, I don't just think of that experience and not just
                  the school, but also lots of other aspects of my life. The summertime
                  was really full of famous artists. Painters from New York. The winter
                  was another kind of population. Those were the grim, hunkered down,
                  gritty regulars. It wasn't a happy place. Actually, it was wretched and
                  miserable most of the time I was there, because it was just poor. That
                  was a great lesson, but I have no idea what it taught.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> It taught you to be who you are. How did Charles Olson influence you there?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Charles Olson gave me my whole
                  impulse to be a writer and the fortitude to hold out. Intellectually,
                  he was the most important person because he was like being around some
                  kind of expansionary force. He just made you get bigger somehow. It was
                  really size, somehow, with him. He was huge himself. In terms of
                  education and learning and the acquisition of information and knowledge
                  of the world, really, there were lots of other people, too. The most
                  important for me was Paul Leser. I took anthropology with him one year,
                  and became a really active amateur anthropologist from that year on.
                  That very much obviously influenced the way I looked at the world. It
                  was in a way that I wouldn't have quite gotten with Olson, who was
                  actually rather impatient with details a lot of the time. He tended to
                  get grand and sweeping, and skip the details.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> I didn't realize that
                  you had studied with an anthropologist, though, with hindsight, it
                  shows both in your writing and in your teaching, especially in the
                  books that you recommended we read. There was always an &quot;eye&quot; there
                  seeing things from a cultural anthropologist's viewpoint.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I'm glad you noticed that,
                  because aside from the literature I got there--and I've had to go back,
                  frankly, and really repair leaks in the plumbing, because at Black
                  Mountain it wasn't a thorough education, it was a fanatical education.
                  It did cover a lot, but there was a lot also they didn't cover. Nobody
                  had heard of Milton there, for instance. You get out in the real world
                  of literature, and you haven't read Milton, it's like a joke.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Though you're probably better off, not having read Milton.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> That was the point encouraged at
                  Black Mountain, but I found that later to be quite untrue. Ignorance is
                  NOT bliss. But the other literature, in fact, that was most important
                  to me there, was anthropology. Things like Morgan's study of the
                  Iroquois, in which he reveals, long before all the current people who
                  are so aghast to learn it, that the Iroquois had instructed the framers
                  of our Constitution a lot. Anyone who read a lot of anthropology in
                  those days knew that. One of the things that I find irritating is that
                  the people who have just woken up five minutes ago say, &quot;See what
                  they've been keeping from us all this time.&quot; It's so stupid. It's their
                  own lazy habits of not reading that leads them into those problems.
                  That's all been there all along.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Did you ever study anthropology with anyone else?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> No, just that one year with him,
                  then that was enough to set the foundation from which I knew how to
                  read anthropology. I knew the basic books. One of the things about
                  anybody's education that has any quality at all is that that's simply
                  the foundation from which you then read the rest of your life. You
                  learn how to put all that together to read the literature. My
                  classmates that year--there were only about three of us--were Joel
                  Oppenheimer and a guy who was a fabric designer later in New York,
                  quite successfully. He was one of those graphic Black Mountain people;
                  they were interesting, too. It's just that the last moment of Black
                  Mountain seemed to be dominated by writing, but just prior to that,
                  say, in 1948, '49, '50, '51--I went there the first time in '50, then I
                  went back again later, in '51, and it was still the whole influence of
                  the painters and the architects who had been there. Buckminster Fuller
                  had been there earlier. His influence was very detested by Olson, who
                  thought he was the most awful, horrible goof who ever lived. Olson
                  would have liked that joke which came later, &quot;Buckminster Fuller's
                  entire mind was formed in a toilet of a 747.&quot; But he has his great
                  fans, too; everyone does. Olson was the last rector. From '45 to '50,
                  that half decade, the influence was German refugees--intellectuals--who
                  found sanctuary at Black Mountain, which literally took them in. Only
                  what you got was only sanctuary, really. The salaries couldn't have
                  amounted to much there; at the best of times, I think, those people got
                  like $100 a month. $100 in the late 40s is not like $100 is now, but
                  still, it wasn't much. You got room and board. You got food, and the
                  food was good, because there was a farm. You got isolation and
                  sanctuary and Shangri-la, but no money. It was a very different kind of
                  barter system and conception there. It's unthinkable now, that you
                  would do anything for anything other than money, because there doesn't
                  seem to be anything other than money now. What would it be? Nobody's
                  friends anymore, and food is dirt cheap. That's nothing anymore. Even
                  the homeless eat, presumably. There's nothing left anymore other than
                  that awful printing press money that we have, which is just like a
                  disease.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> How do world events, and their sometimes absurd surrealism, influence your poetry?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I just write about it, report the
                  events; I don't invent it. In that sense, the early anthropology
                  certainly taught me how to be a witness. I take that as a big part of
                  writing, being a witness.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> So do you see the eye as the most important tool of the poet?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Being a witness is your whole
                  presence. The eye is obviously important. The human race is so
                  exclusively optical that it's programmed to seek what's coming. We
                  don't smell it or hear it much, so we really see it. But obviously the
                  ear's important to me. I like to try not to mimic people at all, but to
                  try to take their language and dress it up with a little richer
                  vocabulary than they might have.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> How did Olson influence your writing?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> The big thing was that I didn't
                  have to go through that struggle about what to write about, because his
                  whole point was that you can write about anything, right off, so that's
                  not going to be a problem. It's how you can cast it or, to use his
                  word, project it (although I get much less out of that than he claimed
                  to). How can you project content and make it your own and use it
                  without restriction? That was the big thing, and how the questions
                  about meaning and content have no meaning, they're unreal. So don't get
                  side tracked by any of that stuff, don't waste your time with
                  struggling with that kind of thing. Because the way the language works
                  and its dynamic IS the important thing, that's the most important
                  thing. Because if you can get force and power and subtlety and all the
                  qualities you want into that, then obviously all these other things
                  aren't going to matter, anyway. There are no proper subjects; that's a
                  foolish idea. So that sounds like it's not technical, but I think it IS
                  very technical.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> It actually sounds very
                  true, like a working writer's technique, not some of those half-assed
                  theories that you hear from a lot of people. It sounds like a formula
                  that a writer can take and work with.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> It is, I think. For one thing,
                  it's general. It's not peculiarized so much that it only applies to one
                  person or a few people, because things that are like that are just less
                  useful. One of the things that a lot of people said at the time and
                  have said since is that my generation (and a little bit before and a
                  little bit after it) was diminished because it had no critics. I've
                  never bought that idea. I think we were absolutely fortunate that we
                  had no critics; critics are really useless. What I think these people
                  mean is that we really didn't have that condition, although they don't
                  say that. And that may or may not be true. But looking around and
                  seeing what the connection in poetry is, it can be really disgusting
                  and banal and not elevating and not enobling and, in the end, except
                  for an isolated clutch of a handful of people, unremunerative. So we're
                  not even talking money with it, because except with the very obvious
                  exceptions, all the attempts to get money out of it, are extremely
                  demeaning. More than other things. A prostitute actually is the oldest
                  profession, and it is legitimate, no matter what society thinks about
                  it. You can name a lot of things like that, the most awful examples
                  that you can come up with, and they have their own legitimacy. And
                  poetry, in that respect, does NOT. It's free to the spirit, and there's
                  no way to corrupt it. It will always be incorruptible. All you can do
                  is corrupt yourself.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Do you think poetry is a dying artform in our society?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Poetry itself is as unchangeable
                  as the orbits. People write it more now, and writing has become one of
                  the great human activities.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> But it's essentially catharsis, because nobody reads it.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Yes, but the whole readership of
                  anything has been so inflated. What we call literacy now actually is
                  just those things--if you get, say, some washing up liquid, it's got a
                  picture of a lemon on it, meaning it's got that fragrance. If you know
                  enough that that's not salad dressing because of the lemon picture on
                  there, then you're literate. That's ALL it means. That's all literacy
                  now means. And if you don't put that on salad, then you're illiterate.
                  There's the same number of readers relative to the population now who
                  can read a poem without a lot of prompting and a lot of problems, as
                  there always were. I don't think it's increased at all. Literacy has
                  nothing to do with that. Literacy is a function now that enables you to
                  get around town: to locate addresses, to drive a car, and read the
                  signs and not put the soap on the salad--all sorts of practical things
                  that if you can't do, if you can't read, you can still get by, as we
                  know people do. It's just more difficult, and they're always sort of
                  living in fear if someone actually asks them what that says--because
                  they know what to do with it, but just don't know what it says. they
                  don't know how to read the word walk, but know when to walk, anyway.
                  You can fake this stuff. Literacy is so low that you can not even
                  possess it and still get by. And apparently a lot of people are doing
                  that.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> But if the population has increased, shouldn't the readership have increased?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I say relative to it: it has.
                  Sure, I think maybe there are 50,000 total readers of poetry in the
                  country now and 10,000 of them might read John Ashbery and say, 3500 of
                  them might read Joe Blow in Montana and maybe 25 might read some guy
                  who's living in the neighborhood. It all gets covered somehow. But
                  that's all there are. In London, say, in John Keats' time, right after
                  the turn of the century, Shelley's time and those people, there were
                  maybe 5,000 readers of poetry. We know that from the sales figures.
                  That can all be reconstructed. Books were quite expensive then, and not
                  just anybody and their dog had a book. So that would be about the same
                  number. That was considered an interest great enough to publish for,
                  and it still is now. I don't think anything has changed in that sense.</font></p>

                  be poetry, or anything else. Like all the famous people who do their
                  biographies. Somebody else does it, because they're ghosted, or they're
                  as told to (and the as told to character might be ghosting it, who

                  doesn't matter. Because they're famous, and that's what's selling.
                  That's a book trade. I'm not willing to say that Jimmy Stewart can't
                  write poetry; anybody can write poetry. To me, they're absolutely
                  disgusting, but they're no more disgusting than that guy who says he

                  you finally do get out to the detergent with the lemon in it, then
                  you've taken in everything. So if that's the definition of literacy,
                  fine. Then all this stuff can be explained on that basis. If you're
                  more exclusive--I don't think, by the way, that any true reader of
                  poetry is an elitist. I know what you mean by that, but I think that
                  the English reader of the first 20 years of the 20th century was a
                  pretty serious character, and might have been quite a democrat,
                  actually. There were, after all, followers of Coleridge in that group.
                  Of course, there was also Lord Byron, who was having everybody on, and
                  he was like a great lord.</font></p>

                  paradoxical kind of elitism, because there was a larger portion of the
                  population at the time that didn't have the opportunity to become what
                  those people were. In our society, if you're illiterate, in a sense,
                  it's your own fault. You do have the opportunity to learn. Not always,
                  because there are always certain environments in which it's harder;
                  it's not the same growing up in the ghetto as growing up in the
                  suburbs, where everything is at your disposal. But at that time, I
                  think, there was much less of a choice than there is now. You're

                  It's called reverse elitism. Would that consist of the competition that
                  arose between Clarence and Anita about how far they had to walk to the
                  toilet when they were growing up? It's worth thinking about; it's
                  certainly interesting. I still maintain anybody who can read a poem
                  well and enjoy it and be informed by it, and actually exchange their
                  own perceptual information with it (which I think is what reading's all
                  about), may be part of the fortunate few, but I refuse to call that
                  elitism, because elitism would be refusing to do that, in some way. It
                  would be knowing how to do it, and not doing it. There's a whole new
                  class, and you'd only know this if you were in the academic racket, but
                  there's a whole new class of people called aliterates, people who can

                  There are lots of great things that are obsolete. Kerosene lamps are

                  Wisconsin. And maybe it's a good thing not to have electricity. Think
                  of the best things in the world, actually, and they're all obsolete.
                  Sure. But that's because a world that grows more and more venal and
                  greedy and opportunistic makes things obsolete at a great rate. And
                  what they replace it with is something pretty awful and fowl and cheap
                  and temporary and terrible. So poetry is REAL obsolete.</font></p>

                  1932 Packard Phaeton is obsolete, one of the great cars ever made. Need
                  I go on about obsolete? The giveaway, actually, was this. I grew up
                  with this; I was 15 years old in 1945. really, post war, the curtain
                  came up, and life began. At that time, there was this word that came on
                  as one of the most smart, zippy ideas ever uttered. it came from
                  Detroit, from automobile engineers, and it was called obsolescence. It
                  was going to be the savior of everybody: it meant that if you had the
                  engineering right, this car door, after 10,000 openings and shuttings,
                  would fall off. And you had to send it to the junkyard. It would keep

                  Mythology and the American West.&quot; It blew everybody's mind, especially
                  at the time, that you could even think of connecting these two things.
                  The fact that you did it successfully totally mystified everyone. How
                  did that relate to your writing, since you were working on <i>Gunslinger</i> at the time?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I think I was thinking about it. I was in the middle of writing <i>Slinger</i> in those years. I think, in fact, I did a lot of Book II here. It was
                  just that the whole preoccupation with Homeric and Virgilian
                  characters--Virgil a lot because <i>The Aenead</i> is really kind of
                  that post-Homer going West. A Western book, of those big classic epics.
                  It's really just soul searching sojourning and meeting phenomena and
                  populations. What's going on. There's usually nothing going on, and
                  everything going on. It's that kind of thing, like raw, human, ordinary
                  life. Dressed up in sort of legendary, fantastic figures. And that's
                  what I was talking about. I don't remember as much of that, because I
                  don't have my notes. The one time I ever lost a notebook was in
                  Chicago. That stuff, plus some other writing, would have been in that
                  notebook. I left it somewhere, and I didn't get it back. Or maybe it
                  just got taken out and thrown into the dump; I have no idea what
                  happened to it. I left it in a class at Northeastern or on an el. I
                  just left it behind somewhere. But you know, the whole Western
                  question, after Black Mountain and Leser and Olson, that was my
                  preoccupation with the subject, and it still is. People who set out to
                  write for the long haul have to--I think one of the problems here is
                  that they don't see the mountains behind the forest. They don't start
                  looking behind each thing that they're doing.</font></p>

                  West. There's a whole book which is based on the premise that Chicago
                  was the colonial exploiter of the Great Plains, in the same way that
                  London controlled Kenya or India, in that same sense. It loaned the
                  money, it bought the crops, it laid down the law. It's fascinating.
                  Chicago as an imperialist place, in that sense. Because you were
                  talking about an area and a gross national product and a transaction
                  far larger than many countries for that relationship, of Chicago and
                  the Great Plains. At one time, I'm sure, it was more true than it is
                  now. So it's part of the West. You know, people call it the Midwest,
                  but really the West is the West. One of the convenient things about
                  Boulder, where I live (although it's an artificial place in many ways)
                  is that it IS the center of the West: it's 1,000 miles in every
                  direction, you're still in the West. I like living at high altitude,
                  where the air's thin and life is cranked down a bit. There's not many
                  bugs. There's less life, and I like that. Because there's just less
                  that can live over 5,000 feet that can live below it; it's pretty
                  simple.</font></p>

                  know why people smoke. It's one of the great tranquilizers ever

                  and fake technology. I think most technology is fake, anyway, so I
                  easn't doing it any favors. Really I just dumped into it what I thought
                  was going onduring the time that I was writing it, which was
                  essentially 1967-68 till about 1976, which was the decade of it. I
                  thought that was the decade that was THE decade. THAT was the '60's.
                  The early '60's were totally different. People who weren't around in
                  those days don't seem to understand, and the historians don't seem to
                  straighten them out on this. The early '60's were nothing like the late
                  '60's. From 1960-65 was like the other side of the moon from 1965-1970.
                  I liked the early '60's. They were really interesting times. The Blacks
                  were burning everything down, the whole population as far as I could
                  tell was on amphetamine. People would say, &quot;Love? What are you talking
                  about? What's that supposed to do for you? Because I KNOW what you mean
                  by that, what are you talking about? Things are more serious than that,
                  surely.&quot; The suddenly that half decade died, and everything was love,
                  and the branches started sprouting green twigs and everybody said,
                  &quot;Isn't it great?&quot; the world was full of walking twinkles and crazy
                  people and abandon, and it was altogether different. And pretty smart
                  and hip. One of the things that was so special about the late 60's was
                  that those were boom times. Everybody was employed; there was a lot for
                  everybody. I don't know how you'd adjust the figures for inflation, but
                  everybody had some money. I didn't know anybody that didn't have some
                  money. The homeless, if they were out there, were homeless because they
                  said, &quot;Fuck you!&quot; to their home. It wasn't because they don't have one.
                  Everything was totally different. Everyone knows about the student
                  rebellions and the beginning of ecology (which was, of course, not
                  true, anyway), but one of the most important things, less talked about,
                  was the economic conditions of that period which made all that
                  possible. You can't just abandon everything unless things are pretty
                  cushy, basically. The reason you don't have anything going on now, of
                  any kind, actually, let alone like that, is because things are not
                  cushy. People have to watch it. You trip now and you've got people on
                  your back, if not elsewhere. This is a fearsome time.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Well, the reason I asked if you think of <i>Slinger</i> as a narrative poem is that even though it's so long, there are whole
                  individual sections. It's very concise, in a sense. Do you think of it
                  as a longpoem or a narrative poem--or both?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> The period of its composition was
                  really stretched out. It was really a portable poem. I could write it
                  in Chicago, San Francisco, Kansas, England--which is, in fact, what I
                  did. It's because it started off with the kind of distance I got on the
                  subject and my feelings for the West, and all the times I had been
                  transported back and forth across it, I had that out there as one big
                  vision. Because I was a long way from it, and I could see it all, in a
                  sense. I was free of its surroundings. That's the only time I got to
                  have that experience with a work of that kind. It was a great
                  experience to have. It affected the poem a lot. It freed me up from
                  feeling the pressure of making the narrative be true or make sense or
                  whatever--I just let it be its own thread and what people are saying to
                  each other, the kind of, sort of vague, abstract sort of irrepressible
                  mindlessness at times, and the vocabulary that generates and all that,
                  were natural to the time. That's what I was hearing around me. When I
                  look at that poem now, I don't see it as anything but an empiricism of
                  the language that I was hearing at the time. I'm not making that up.
                  I'm just giving it a kind of expression. You mentioned before about
                  making connections with the obvious. Well, that's true. The reasons why
                  most people recognize something as obvious but don't necessarily make
                  the connection themselves and therefore dispense with that service that
                  I can provide, is because they just don't want to be involved with that
                  kind of energy that makes them preoccupied with that, and, I think,
                  that's probably good. Because if you couldn't point out the obvious and
                  make it fresh and stunning, for instance, what would life be? Because
                  except for things that are extremely esoteric and only a few scientists
                  know about, everything IS obvious. So if we couldn't constantly claim a
                  new connection for the obvious, we'd be in bad trouble real quick. life
                  would get insufferably dull. And TV wouldn't be able to save us.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> But can TV save us from anything?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Well, it fills in those spaces. I
                  don't think anybody, even the most diehard addict, and the most
                  brainwashed and programmed under-control video freak lives entirely
                  with video because you can't do it. The instrument itself disallows any
                  real attention. It's its own worst enemy, in terms of the ultimacy of
                  its control. In the sense that it doesn't have the power to actually
                  capture you: that's one of the hilarious things about it. People who
                  have the habit the worst pay the least attention to it. Because they're
                  already phased. The flapping of the lines just drives them away.
                  There's something really strange, psychologically, going on.
                  Conversely, people who don't watch very much or who don't have it and
                  want to see something on it, can pay the most rapt attention when they
                  do. I have a TV, but I have friends who don't. There is a kind of
                  affectation in Boulder, a lot of people don't have TVs. Once in a
                  while, they want to see something, and they come around. I mean, I
                  couldn't watch TV like that. I watch it--I'm not an addict, but I watch
                  enough of it--but I see them watching it, and they're really on it. But
                  that's because they don't watch it regularly. Otherwise, if you watch
                  it a little bit, you can either take it or leave it. The narrative is
                  essentially linguistic, because it starts out with a series of--it's a
                  standard setting, in cowboy times, with a coach in Billy the Kid
                  country and it's on the border. It goes through all those kinds of
                  references: this is the excuse for using a kind of Spanglish: not
                  exactly, but a kind of Chinook jargon Spanish which runs all the way
                  through it. Because it is the Southwest, but that's in there for
                  flavor, and to sort of zip it once in a while. But what's happening all
                  the time is that it's just a series that moves along and somebody looks
                  out the window and says something like, &quot;Hey, man, it's a crazy
                  landscape.&quot; Then the talk goes on from there about what's actually in
                  it. Then I'm all the time collecting strange words--like along around
                  that time I discovered the word &quot;hoodoo,&quot; which I thought was some kind
                  of magic or religious thing. It turns out to be, not spelled quite that
                  way, a geological term for certain kind of moundy-like things. So that
                  gets conflated with a certain drift of the conversation which might be
                  about magic or perceptions or stuff like that--so that becomes
                  increasingly the poem's preoccupation. How do the puns and ambiguities
                  of language enter into everyday life? Because this is like everyday
                  life back then: it's a time trip. These people are taking a stagecoach.
                  I've tried to make it more exotic by having six driverless horses. At
                  first, I thought, &quot;Wow, six driverless horses, fantastic! That's
                  amazing. Boy, what am I going to do with that?&quot; Well, I did nothing
                  with that. Because by the time it came around again and it was time to
                  do something with it, I thought, &quot;Well, I'm not going to go back and do
                  it. So they're driverless, to hell with it. That doesn't mean anything.
                  There's just no driver.&quot; In other words, the whole idea is just
                  generating this in the reader also. We're like dogs to a certain
                  extent. We go around and sniff here and there, and we may not go back.
                  The circle may never be completed. That's why I said, &quot;Alright, if
                  that's what's happening, then that's what's happening.&quot; Driverless
                  horses because really I don't want to have to bother with having to
                  deal with a driver. I don't want to describe him. I just want to stay
                  inside the coach. So these horses know where they're going: The horse
                  knows the way to carry the sleigh, through the something and the
                  drifting snow. Maybe it comes from that kind of stuff: over the river
                  and through the woods, to Grandmother's house we go. It's the same
                  thing. He didn't have a driver, either. The horse knows the way. That's
                  what horses do.</font></p>

                  intelligence in mythology, although anybody who's been around horses
                  knows that they're dumb as shit. They don't even have an intelligence,
                  what they've got is an incredibly active and really dangerous and
                  vibrating nervous system. They're all nerves. In so far as maybe their
                  brains are extensions of their nervous systems, then the nervous system
                  IS their intelligence, except draft horses. I grew up with draft
                  horses; they're really placid. They weigh about 1500-2000 pounds, like
                  a ton. The only thing is, you don't want to have your foot underneath
                  when they take a step to the side and shift weight, because you're
                  talking big. We better get off horses, because I'm sure no expert, and

                  more experts on horses than there are experts on poets. Incidentally,
                  why haven't you ever wanted to live in a writer's community like
                  Bolinas, for instance?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I never visited Bolinas for more
                  than one day in my life. I never even stayed overnight. I would never
                  even consider living there. California to me was San Francisco; it has
                  always been two things to me: San Francisco or LA. In recent years,
                  I've enjoyed going to LA. But when I lived in California, I loved
                  living in San Francisco. In the 70's that was a great town to live in.
                  Some of the best years. But I would never have lived out in the
                  country, like Bolinas; it's too far away. I would get real bored out
                  there. San Francisco was a town, and I moved around in it a lot, living
                  in various parts of it. I had a lot of friends there, and we were
                  really active. I saw them a lot. We had a lot to talk about; we did a
                  lot of things together. In those years, in the '70's, there was that
                  run-down from the '60's boom, and it was still possible to work around,
                  pretty much on your own terms. I's do a job here, a job there. I read a
                  lot in those days. So I'd paste it together. It was a kind of scrappy
                  way to make a living, but we were really happy. Then inflation came,
                  and I had to get a place to raise the kids and put them through school.
                  That wasn't going to happen in San Francisco. It was under that stupid,
                  mistaken civic irresponsible moving people around in school busing: it
                  was wasting the kids' time and not giving them an education, just
                  moving meat around. Just in the name of somebody satisfying their own
                  guilt about not having an integrated society here, which they haven't
                  solved, anyway. In the meantime, we screwed up a whole generation of
                  people. So when I saw a chance to get out, I took it, because I knew
                  what was coming. Kidd was in the first grade, and Maya was in
                  kindergarten, so we got out just in time. When we moved to Boulder, I
                  knew we weren't going to have to worry about it. And it would free my
                  time up a lot. We'd been in San Francisco most of the '70's. We didn't
                  live there the whole time, but that's what we called home. We'd been to
                  England a couple of times during that period. We'd had the best of it:
                  the '70's were marvelous in San Francisco. It was the last moment
                  before the plague struck, before everyone got really self-conscious
                  about who they were and taking exception to every little thing that
                  happened, which I take it they're embroiled in now to no effect
                  whatsoever. The '70's were free of that. It was the down time. The
                  '70's get a really bad rap. They say, &quot;What decade was that?&quot; Or, &quot;Oh,
                  there was a '70's? I thought it went from the '60's to the '80's.&quot; But
                  actually, it was a very restful and nice time. It was cool.</font></p>

                  often veer into diatribes or dated nonsense. It was interesting in your
                  comments during your reading at Northeastern that you said about
                  selecting the poems for <i>Abhorrences</i> that you had to throw out a
                  lot of them, because, &quot;It was just trash.&quot; How do you distinguish
                  between writing poetry that's true, but still has a political message,
                  and political vehemence?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I think, in the case of <i>Abhorrences</i>,
                  the standard there was rather overwrought and a little too vicious and
                  a little like really getting a knife in. But then you could look at
                  this and say, &quot;But actually, the knife's into what, when it comes right
                  down to it?&quot; You're not separated enough from it. So I tended to choose
                  the things that got off a little bit, lowered the temperature on
                  things, got a little bit cold, a little high-minded, a little superior,
                  not too involved. That would have been the kind of things. Therefore,
                  less messy. A lot of stuff was just like this was spinning around some
                  kind of pointlessness or it's a rant pure and simple. One of the things
                  about political poetry is that you have to sort of imply to the reader
                  that this is a rather intimate situation in which I'm going to say
                  something that's rather stiff to you, and you're going to like it,
                  because actually you agree when it comes right down to it. You sort of
                  have to have the kind of--you just have to feel how you do that in a
                  poem. It's presumption, but it's with a kind of presumption that you
                  can't offend the reader with or alienate the reader into saying, &quot;Wow,
                  that IS a presumption.&quot; You have to include the reader.</font></p>

                  Illinois University from 1970-1972, where he was influential in

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> My life at the University of
                  Illinois preceding that had been pretty confused and not focused, so
                  going to Black Mountain didn't help the confusion much, but it
                  certainly made me focused. In fact, the confusion only increased. Black
                  Mountain was really good for confusing you. It was the dying embers of
                  a once-great educational experiment. There would be lots of ways of
                  characterizing it, but an intellectual adventure was what it was for
                  me, and I hadn't had one.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> So it came at the right time in the development of your intellect?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I think so, yes. I was in my mid
                  20's. A bit late, in that sense, but it wasn't going to happen earlier
                  than that. I just learned about it because I didn't have those kind of
                  connections to know about a place like Black Mountain. But when I think
                  of Black Mountain, I don't just think of that experience and not just
                  the school, but also lots of other aspects of my life. The summertime
                  was really full of famous artists. Painters from New York. The winter
                  was another kind of population. Those were the grim, hunkered down,
                  gritty regulars. It wasn't a happy place. Actually, it was wretched and
                  miserable most of the time I was there, because it was just poor. That
                  was a great lesson, but I have no idea what it taught.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> It taught you to be who you are. How did Charles Olson influence you there?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Charles Olson gave me my whole
                  impulse to be a writer and the fortitude to hold out. Intellectually,
                  he was the most important person because he was like being around some
                  kind of expansionary force. He just made you get bigger somehow. It was
                  really size, somehow, with him. He was huge himself. In terms of
                  education and learning and the acquisition of information and knowledge
                  of the world, really, there were lots of other people, too. The most
                  important for me was Paul Leser. I took anthropology with him one year,
                  and became a really active amateur anthropologist from that year on.
                  That very much obviously influenced the way I looked at the world. It
                  was in a way that I wouldn't have quite gotten with Olson, who was
                  actually rather impatient with details a lot of the time. He tended to
                  get grand and sweeping, and skip the details.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> I didn't realize that
                  you had studied with an anthropologist, though, with hindsight, it
                  shows both in your writing and in your teaching, especially in the
                  books that you recommended we read. There was always an &quot;eye&quot; there
                  seeing things from a cultural anthropologist's viewpoint.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I'm glad you noticed that,
                  because aside from the literature I got there--and I've had to go back,
                  frankly, and really repair leaks in the plumbing, because at Black
                  Mountain it wasn't a thorough education, it was a fanatical education.
                  It did cover a lot, but there was a lot also they didn't cover. Nobody
                  had heard of Milton there, for instance. You get out in the real world
                  of literature, and you haven't read Milton, it's like a joke.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Though you're probably better off, not having read Milton.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> That was the point encouraged at
                  Black Mountain, but I found that later to be quite untrue. Ignorance is
                  NOT bliss. But the other literature, in fact, that was most important
                  to me there, was anthropology. Things like Morgan's study of the
                  Iroquois, in which he reveals, long before all the current people who
                  are so aghast to learn it, that the Iroquois had instructed the framers
                  of our Constitution a lot. Anyone who read a lot of anthropology in
                  those days knew that. One of the things that I find irritating is that
                  the people who have just woken up five minutes ago say, &quot;See what
                  they've been keeping from us all this time.&quot; It's so stupid. It's their
                  own lazy habits of not reading that leads them into those problems.
                  That's all been there all along.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Did you ever study anthropology with anyone else?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> No, just that one year with him,
                  then that was enough to set the foundation from which I knew how to
                  read anthropology. I knew the basic books. One of the things about
                  anybody's education that has any quality at all is that that's simply
                  the foundation from which you then read the rest of your life. You
                  learn how to put all that together to read the literature. My
                  classmates that year--there were only about three of us--were Joel
                  Oppenheimer and a guy who was a fabric designer later in New York,
                  quite successfully. He was one of those graphic Black Mountain people;
                  they were interesting, too. It's just that the last moment of Black
                  Mountain seemed to be dominated by writing, but just prior to that,
                  say, in 1948, '49, '50, '51--I went there the first time in '50, then I
                  went back again later, in '51, and it was still the whole influence of
                  the painters and the architects who had been there. Buckminster Fuller
                  had been there earlier. His influence was very detested by Olson, who
                  thought he was the most awful, horrible goof who ever lived. Olson
                  would have liked that joke which came later, &quot;Buckminster Fuller's
                  entire mind was formed in a toilet of a 747.&quot; But he has his great
                  fans, too; everyone does. Olson was the last rector. From '45 to '50,
                  that half decade, the influence was German refugees--intellectuals--who
                  found sanctuary at Black Mountain, which literally took them in. Only
                  what you got was only sanctuary, really. The salaries couldn't have
                  amounted to much there; at the best of times, I think, those people got
                  like $100 a month. $100 in the late 40s is not like $100 is now, but
                  still, it wasn't much. You got room and board. You got food, and the
                  food was good, because there was a farm. You got isolation and
                  sanctuary and Shangri-la, but no money. It was a very different kind of
                  barter system and conception there. It's unthinkable now, that you
                  would do anything for anything other than money, because there doesn't
                  seem to be anything other than money now. What would it be? Nobody's
                  friends anymore, and food is dirt cheap. That's nothing anymore. Even
                  the homeless eat, presumably. There's nothing left anymore other than
                  that awful printing press money that we have, which is just like a
                  disease.</font></p>

                  events; I don't invent it. In that sense, the early anthropology
                  certainly taught me how to be a witness. I take that as a big part of
                  writing, being a witness.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> So do you see the eye as the most important tool of the poet?</font></p>

                  presence. The eye is obviously important. The human race is so
                  exclusively optical that it's programmed to seek what's coming. We
                  don't smell it or hear it much, so we really see it. But obviously the
                  ear's important to me. I like to try not to mimic people at all, but to
                  try to take their language and dress it up with a little richer
                  vocabulary than they might have.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> How did Olson influence your writing?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> The big thing was that I didn't
                  have to go through that struggle about what to write about, because his
                  whole point was that you can write about anything, right off, so that's
                  not going to be a problem. It's how you can cast it or, to use his
                  word, project it (although I get much less out of that than he claimed
                  to). How can you project content and make it your own and use it
                  without restriction? That was the big thing, and how the questions
                  about meaning and content have no meaning, they're unreal. So don't get
                  side tracked by any of that stuff, don't waste your time with
                  struggling with that kind of thing. Because the way the language works
                  and its dynamic IS the important thing, that's the most important
                  thing. Because if you can get force and power and subtlety and all the
                  qualities you want into that, then obviously all these other things
                  aren't going to matter, anyway. There are no proper subjects; that's a
                  foolish idea. So that sounds like it's not technical, but I think it IS
                  very technical.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> It actually sounds very
                  true, like a working writer's technique, not some of those half-assed
                  theories that you hear from a lot of people. It sounds like a formula
                  that a writer can take and work with.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> It is, I think. For one thing,
                  it's general. It's not peculiarized so much that it only applies to one
                  person or a few people, because things that are like that are just less
                  useful. One of the things that a lot of people said at the time and
                  have said since is that my generation (and a little bit before and a
                  little bit after it) was diminished because it had no critics. I've
                  never bought that idea. I think we were absolutely fortunate that we
                  had no critics; critics are really useless. What I think these people
                  mean is that we really didn't have that condition, although they don't
                  say that. And that may or may not be true. But looking around and
                  seeing what the connection in poetry is, it can be really disgusting
                  and banal and not elevating and not enobling and, in the end, except
                  for an isolated clutch of a handful of people, unremunerative. So we're
                  not even talking money with it, because except with the very obvious
                  exceptions, all the attempts to get money out of it, are extremely
                  demeaning. More than other things. A prostitute actually is the oldest
                  profession, and it is legitimate, no matter what society thinks about
                  it. You can name a lot of things like that, the most awful examples
                  that you can come up with, and they have their own legitimacy. And
                  poetry, in that respect, does NOT. It's free to the spirit, and there's
                  no way to corrupt it. It will always be incorruptible. All you can do
                  is corrupt yourself.</font></p>

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Poetry itself is as unchangeable

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> But it's essentially catharsis, because nobody reads it.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Yes, but the whole readership of
                  anything has been so inflated. What we call literacy now actually is
                  just those things--if you get, say, some washing up liquid, it's got a
                  picture of a lemon on it, meaning it's got that fragrance. If you know
                  enough that that's not salad dressing because of the lemon picture on
                  there, then you're literate. That's ALL it means. That's all literacy
                  now means. And if you don't put that on salad, then you're illiterate.
                  There's the same number of readers relative to the population now who
                  can read a poem without a lot of prompting and a lot of problems, as
                  there always were. I don't think it's increased at all. Literacy has
                  nothing to do with that. Literacy is a function now that enables you to
                  get around town: to locate addresses, to drive a car, and read the
                  signs and not put the soap on the salad--all sorts of practical things
                  that if you can't do, if you can't read, you can still get by, as we
                  know people do. It's just more difficult, and they're always sort of
                  living in fear if someone actually asks them what that says--because
                  they know what to do with it, but just don't know what it says. they
                  don't know how to read the word walk, but know when to walk, anyway.
                  You can fake this stuff. Literacy is so low that you can not even
                  possess it and still get by. And apparently a lot of people are doing
                  that.</font></p>

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I say relative to it: it has.
                  Sure, I think maybe there are 50,000 total readers of poetry in the
                  country now and 10,000 of them might read John Ashbery and say, 3500 of
                  them might read Joe Blow in Montana and maybe 25 might read some guy
                  who's living in the neighborhood. It all gets covered somehow. But
                  that's all there are. In London, say, in John Keats' time, right after
                  the turn of the century, Shelley's time and those people, there were
                  maybe 5,000 readers of poetry. We know that from the sales figures.
                  That can all be reconstructed. Books were quite expensive then, and not
                  just anybody and their dog had a book. So that would be about the same
                  number. That was considered an interest great enough to publish for,
                  and it still is now. I don't think anything has changed in that sense.</font></p>

                  it poetry, obviously. But this is publishing by famous people. You get
                  famous for something, and you can publish a book on anything. It could
                  be poetry, or anything else. Like all the famous people who do their
                  biographies. Somebody else does it, because they're ghosted, or they're
                  as told to (and the as told to character might be ghosting it, who
                  knows--these are contract jobs). The fact is, it doesn't matter what
                  these books are to sell: poetry, biography, adventure, travel, my idea
                  about this or Shirley MacLaine and how to go to Peru and get shook. It
                  doesn't matter. Because they're famous, and that's what's selling.
                  That's a book trade. I'm not willing to say that Jimmy Stewart can't
                  write poetry; anybody can write poetry. To me, they're absolutely
                  disgusting, but they're no more disgusting than that guy who says he
                  learned everything in life in kindergarten. That, in fact, is worse.
                  Robert Ludlum, or something. He's the successor to <i>Jonathan Seagull</i>.
                  That kind of writing has been around a long time. It's stuff that if it
                  was squished in between your toes, you'd just jump and run to the

                  define literacy. If we want to widen the scope further and further till
                  you finally do get out to the detergent with the lemon in it, then
                  you've taken in everything. So if that's the definition of literacy,
                  fine. Then all this stuff can be explained on that basis. If you're
                  more exclusive--I don't think, by the way, that any true reader of
                  poetry is an elitist. I know what you mean by that, but I think that
                  the English reader of the first 20 years of the 20th century was a
                  pretty serious character, and might have been quite a democrat,
                  actually. There were, after all, followers of Coleridge in that group.
                  Of course, there was also Lord Byron, who was having everybody on, and
                  he was like a great lord.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Well, it is a
                  paradoxical kind of elitism, because there was a larger portion of the
                  population at the time that didn't have the opportunity to become what
                  those people were. In our society, if you're illiterate, in a sense,
                  it's your own fault. You do have the opportunity to learn. Not always,
                  because there are always certain environments in which it's harder;
                  it's not the same growing up in the ghetto as growing up in the
                  suburbs, where everything is at your disposal. But at that time, I
                  think, there was much less of a choice than there is now. You're
                  responsible, in essence, for your own literacy now--and/or, illiteracy.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Let's just invent a term here.
                  It's called reverse elitism. Would that consist of the competition that
                  arose between Clarence and Anita about how far they had to walk to the
                  toilet when they were growing up? It's worth thinking about; it's
                  certainly interesting. I still maintain anybody who can read a poem
                  well and enjoy it and be informed by it, and actually exchange their
                  own perceptual information with it (which I think is what reading's all
                  about), may be part of the fortunate few, but I refuse to call that
                  elitism, because elitism would be refusing to do that, in some way. It
                  would be knowing how to do it, and not doing it. There's a whole new
                  class, and you'd only know this if you were in the academic racket, but
                  there's a whole new class of people called aliterates, people who can
                  read but won't. This is the going body that we're talking about.</font></p>

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> It's obsolete, yeah. But so what?
                  There are lots of great things that are obsolete. Kerosene lamps are
                  obsolete, but there's no light like it in a cabin in Northern
                  Wisconsin. And maybe it's a good thing not to have electricity. Think
                  of the best things in the world, actually, and they're all obsolete.
                  Sure. But that's because a world that grows more and more venal and
                  greedy and opportunistic makes things obsolete at a great rate. And
                  what they replace it with is something pretty awful and fowl and cheap
                  and temporary and terrible. So poetry is REAL obsolete.</font></p>

                  me feel like I'm working with something that's good enough to be
                  obsolete. I'll tell you, horses are obsolete, and horses are great. A
                  1932 Packard Phaeton is obsolete, one of the great cars ever made. Need
                  I go on about obsolete? The giveaway, actually, was this. I grew up
                  with this; I was 15 years old in 1945. really, post war, the curtain
                  came up, and life began. At that time, there was this word that came on
                  as one of the most smart, zippy ideas ever uttered. it came from
                  Detroit, from automobile engineers, and it was called obsolescence. It
                  was going to be the savior of everybody: it meant that if you had the
                  engineering right, this car door, after 10,000 openings and shuttings,
                  would fall off. And you had to send it to the junkyard. It would keep
                  people employed: let's start things over again, let's start turning
                  this over.</font></p>

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Years ago, you taught a
                  class at Northeastern Illinois University called &quot;Classical Greek
                  Mythology and the American West.&quot; It blew everybody's mind, especially
                  at the time, that you could even think of connecting these two things.
                  The fact that you did it successfully totally mystified everyone. How
                  did that relate to your writing, since you were working on <i>Gunslinger</i> at the time?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I think I was thinking about it. I was in the middle of writing <i>Slinger</i> in those years. I think, in fact, I did a lot of Book II here. It was
                  just that the whole preoccupation with Homeric and Virgilian
                  characters--Virgil a lot because <i>The Aenead</i> is really kind of
                  that post-Homer going West. A Western book, of those big classic epics.
                  It's really just soul searching sojourning and meeting phenomena and
                  populations. What's going on. There's usually nothing going on, and
                  everything going on. It's that kind of thing, like raw, human, ordinary
                  life. Dressed up in sort of legendary, fantastic figures. And that's
                  what I was talking about. I don't remember as much of that, because I
                  don't have my notes. The one time I ever lost a notebook was in
                  Chicago. That stuff, plus some other writing, would have been in that
                  notebook. I left it somewhere, and I didn't get it back. Or maybe it
                  just got taken out and thrown into the dump; I have no idea what
                  happened to it. I left it in a class at Northeastern or on an el. I
                  just left it behind somewhere. But you know, the whole Western
                  question, after Black Mountain and Leser and Olson, that was my
                  preoccupation with the subject, and it still is. People who set out to
                  write for the long haul have to--I think one of the problems here is
                  that they don't see the mountains behind the forest. They don't start
                  looking behind each thing that they're doing.</font></p>

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Chicago is the capitol of the
                  West. There's a whole book which is based on the premise that Chicago
                  was the colonial exploiter of the Great Plains, in the same way that
                  London controlled Kenya or India, in that same sense. It loaned the
                  money, it bought the crops, it laid down the law. It's fascinating.
                  Chicago as an imperialist place, in that sense. Because you were
                  talking about an area and a gross national product and a transaction
                  far larger than many countries for that relationship, of Chicago and
                  the Great Plains. At one time, I'm sure, it was more true than it is
                  now. So it's part of the West. You know, people call it the Midwest,
                  but really the West is the West. One of the convenient things about
                  Boulder, where I live (although it's an artificial place in many ways)
                  is that it IS the center of the West: it's 1,000 miles in every
                  direction, you're still in the West. I like living at high altitude,
                  where the air's thin and life is cranked down a bit. There's not many
                  bugs. There's less life, and I like that. Because there's just less
                  that can live over 5,000 feet that can live below it; it's pretty
                  simple.</font></p>

                  example. You have this amazing facility for making connections like
                  that, a preoccupation with language that results in making connections
                  that most people just don't see, but that are really obvious, though,
                  once you've pointed them out. Does that stem from anything in

                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> No, it just stems from the will
                  to do it, and a lot of practice and a certain kind of metabolism. When
                  I stopped smoking, it got worse, actually. Smoking is a narcotic. I
                  know why people smoke. It's one of the great tranquilizers ever
                  discovered by mankind. The reason why it's so horrible is that people
                  invented cigarette machines and packaged them and made them terrible.
                  But tobacco itself is really a great medicine. No doubt about it. The

                  You, with the cigarette that you were always going to light, that would
                  take probably about an hour, and Ted, who would have gone through about
                  10 of them during that same time, but with the cigarette just sitting
                  in his mouth after he lit it, and the ashes just dropping all over his
                  beard and the floor. It would have been a very conceptual portrait of
                  two American poets talking about poetry. But now he's dead and you're

                  a thinnish excuse. The bare bones of the thing. It's the simplest
                  thing, just taking a trip. Just on the road. Like <i>On the Road</i> didn't invent on the road. Everything was on the road. That's what the Greek epics are, on the road. <i>The Iliad</i> is fixed; that's the difference. But <i>The Aenead</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i> are on the road. <i>Slinger</i> is just on the road in more modern times, with horses and stagecoaches
                  and fake technology. I think most technology is fake, anyway, so I
                  easn't doing it any favors. Really I just dumped into it what I thought
                  was going onduring the time that I was writing it, which was
                  essentially 1967-68 till about 1976, which was the decade of it. I
                  thought that was the decade that was THE decade. THAT was the '60's.
                  The early '60's were totally different. People who weren't around in
                  those days don't seem to understand, and the historians don't seem to
                  straighten them out on this. The early '60's were nothing like the late
                  '60's. From 1960-65 was like the other side of the moon from 1965-1970.
                  I liked the early '60's. They were really interesting times. The Blacks
                  were burning everything down, the whole population as far as I could
                  tell was on amphetamine. People would say, &quot;Love? What are you talking
                  about? What's that supposed to do for you? Because I KNOW what you mean
                  by that, what are you talking about? Things are more serious than that,
                  surely.&quot; The suddenly that half decade died, and everything was love,
                  and the branches started sprouting green twigs and everybody said,
                  &quot;Isn't it great?&quot; the world was full of walking twinkles and crazy
                  people and abandon, and it was altogether different. And pretty smart
                  and hip. One of the things that was so special about the late 60's was
                  that those were boom times. Everybody was employed; there was a lot for
                  everybody. I don't know how you'd adjust the figures for inflation, but
                  everybody had some money. I didn't know anybody that didn't have some
                  money. The homeless, if they were out there, were homeless because they
                  said, &quot;Fuck you!&quot; to their home. It wasn't because they don't have one.
                  Everything was totally different. Everyone knows about the student
                  rebellions and the beginning of ecology (which was, of course, not
                  true, anyway), but one of the most important things, less talked about,
                  was the economic conditions of that period which made all that
                  possible. You can't just abandon everything unless things are pretty
                  cushy, basically. The reason you don't have anything going on now, of
                  any kind, actually, let alone like that, is because things are not
                  cushy. People have to watch it. You trip now and you've got people on
                  your back, if not elsewhere. This is a fearsome time.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> Well, the reason I asked if you think of <i>Slinger</i> as a narrative poem is that even though it's so long, there are whole
                  individual sections. It's very concise, in a sense. Do you think of it
                  as a longpoem or a narrative poem--or both?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> The period of its composition was
                  really stretched out. It was really a portable poem. I could write it
                  in Chicago, San Francisco, Kansas, England--which is, in fact, what I
                  did. It's because it started off with the kind of distance I got on the
                  subject and my feelings for the West, and all the times I had been
                  transported back and forth across it, I had that out there as one big
                  vision. Because I was a long way from it, and I could see it all, in a
                  sense. I was free of its surroundings. That's the only time I got to
                  have that experience with a work of that kind. It was a great
                  experience to have. It affected the poem a lot. It freed me up from
                  feeling the pressure of making the narrative be true or make sense or
                  whatever--I just let it be its own thread and what people are saying to
                  each other, the kind of, sort of vague, abstract sort of irrepressible
                  mindlessness at times, and the vocabulary that generates and all that,
                  were natural to the time. That's what I was hearing around me. When I
                  look at that poem now, I don't see it as anything but an empiricism of
                  the language that I was hearing at the time. I'm not making that up.
                  I'm just giving it a kind of expression. You mentioned before about
                  making connections with the obvious. Well, that's true. The reasons why
                  most people recognize something as obvious but don't necessarily make
                  the connection themselves and therefore dispense with that service that
                  I can provide, is because they just don't want to be involved with that
                  kind of energy that makes them preoccupied with that, and, I think,
                  that's probably good. Because if you couldn't point out the obvious and
                  make it fresh and stunning, for instance, what would life be? Because
                  except for things that are extremely esoteric and only a few scientists
                  know about, everything IS obvious. So if we couldn't constantly claim a
                  new connection for the obvious, we'd be in bad trouble real quick. life
                  would get insufferably dull. And TV wouldn't be able to save us.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> But can TV save us from anything?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> Well, it fills in those spaces. I
                  don't think anybody, even the most diehard addict, and the most
                  brainwashed and programmed under-control video freak lives entirely
                  with video because you can't do it. The instrument itself disallows any
                  real attention. It's its own worst enemy, in terms of the ultimacy of
                  its control. In the sense that it doesn't have the power to actually
                  capture you: that's one of the hilarious things about it. People who
                  have the habit the worst pay the least attention to it. Because they're
                  already phased. The flapping of the lines just drives them away.
                  There's something really strange, psychologically, going on.
                  Conversely, people who don't watch very much or who don't have it and
                  want to see something on it, can pay the most rapt attention when they
                  do. I have a TV, but I have friends who don't. There is a kind of
                  affectation in Boulder, a lot of people don't have TVs. Once in a
                  while, they want to see something, and they come around. I mean, I
                  couldn't watch TV like that. I watch it--I'm not an addict, but I watch
                  enough of it--but I see them watching it, and they're really on it. But
                  that's because they don't watch it regularly. Otherwise, if you watch
                  it a little bit, you can either take it or leave it. The narrative is
                  essentially linguistic, because it starts out with a series of--it's a
                  standard setting, in cowboy times, with a coach in Billy the Kid
                  country and it's on the border. It goes through all those kinds of
                  references: this is the excuse for using a kind of Spanglish: not
                  exactly, but a kind of Chinook jargon Spanish which runs all the way
                  through it. Because it is the Southwest, but that's in there for
                  flavor, and to sort of zip it once in a while. But what's happening all
                  the time is that it's just a series that moves along and somebody looks
                  out the window and says something like, &quot;Hey, man, it's a crazy
                  landscape.&quot; Then the talk goes on from there about what's actually in
                  it. Then I'm all the time collecting strange words--like along around
                  that time I discovered the word &quot;hoodoo,&quot; which I thought was some kind
                  of magic or religious thing. It turns out to be, not spelled quite that
                  way, a geological term for certain kind of moundy-like things. So that
                  gets conflated with a certain drift of the conversation which might be
                  about magic or perceptions or stuff like that--so that becomes
                  increasingly the poem's preoccupation. How do the puns and ambiguities
                  of language enter into everyday life? Because this is like everyday
                  life back then: it's a time trip. These people are taking a stagecoach.
                  I've tried to make it more exotic by having six driverless horses. At
                  first, I thought, &quot;Wow, six driverless horses, fantastic! That's
                  amazing. Boy, what am I going to do with that?&quot; Well, I did nothing
                  with that. Because by the time it came around again and it was time to
                  do something with it, I thought, &quot;Well, I'm not going to go back and do
                  it. So they're driverless, to hell with it. That doesn't mean anything.
                  There's just no driver.&quot; In other words, the whole idea is just
                  generating this in the reader also. We're like dogs to a certain
                  extent. We go around and sniff here and there, and we may not go back.
                  The circle may never be completed. That's why I said, &quot;Alright, if
                  that's what's happening, then that's what's happening.&quot; Driverless
                  horses because really I don't want to have to bother with having to
                  deal with a driver. I don't want to describe him. I just want to stay
                  inside the coach. So these horses know where they're going: The horse
                  knows the way to carry the sleigh, through the something and the
                  drifting snow. Maybe it comes from that kind of stuff: over the river
                  and through the woods, to Grandmother's house we go. It's the same
                  thing. He didn't have a driver, either. The horse knows the way. That's
                  what horses do.</font></p>

                  intelligence in mythology, although anybody who's been around horses
                  knows that they're dumb as shit. They don't even have an intelligence,
                  what they've got is an incredibly active and really dangerous and
                  vibrating nervous system. They're all nerves. In so far as maybe their
                  brains are extensions of their nervous systems, then the nervous system
                  IS their intelligence, except draft horses. I grew up with draft
                  horses; they're really placid. They weigh about 1500-2000 pounds, like
                  a ton. The only thing is, you don't want to have your foot underneath
                  when they take a step to the side and shift weight, because you're
                  talking big. We better get off horses, because I'm sure no expert, and
                  there are a lot of experts in horses.</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EFFIE MIHOPOULOS:</b> I bet there are a lot
                  more experts on horses than there are experts on poets. Incidentally,
                  why haven't you ever wanted to live in a writer's community like
                  Bolinas, for instance?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I never visited Bolinas for more
                  than one day in my life. I never even stayed overnight. I would never
                  even consider living there. California to me was San Francisco; it has
                  always been two things to me: San Francisco or LA. In recent years,
                  I've enjoyed going to LA. But when I lived in California, I loved
                  living in San Francisco. In the 70's that was a great town to live in.
                  Some of the best years. But I would never have lived out in the
                  country, like Bolinas; it's too far away. I would get real bored out
                  there. San Francisco was a town, and I moved around in it a lot, living
                  in various parts of it. I had a lot of friends there, and we were
                  really active. I saw them a lot. We had a lot to talk about; we did a
                  lot of things together. In those years, in the '70's, there was that
                  run-down from the '60's boom, and it was still possible to work around,
                  pretty much on your own terms. I's do a job here, a job there. I read a
                  lot in those days. So I'd paste it together. It was a kind of scrappy
                  way to make a living, but we were really happy. Then inflation came,
                  and I had to get a place to raise the kids and put them through school.
                  That wasn't going to happen in San Francisco. It was under that stupid,
                  mistaken civic irresponsible moving people around in school busing: it
                  was wasting the kids' time and not giving them an education, just
                  moving meat around. Just in the name of somebody satisfying their own
                  guilt about not having an integrated society here, which they haven't
                  solved, anyway. In the meantime, we screwed up a whole generation of
                  people. So when I saw a chance to get out, I took it, because I knew
                  what was coming. Kidd was in the first grade, and Maya was in
                  kindergarten, so we got out just in time. When we moved to Boulder, I
                  knew we weren't going to have to worry about it. And it would free my
                  time up a lot. We'd been in San Francisco most of the '70's. We didn't
                  live there the whole time, but that's what we called home. We'd been to
                  England a couple of times during that period. We'd had the best of it:
                  the '70's were marvelous in San Francisco. It was the last moment
                  before the plague struck, before everyone got really self-conscious
                  about who they were and taking exception to every little thing that
                  happened, which I take it they're embroiled in now to no effect
                  whatsoever. The '70's were free of that. It was the down time. The
                  '70's get a really bad rap. They say, &quot;What decade was that?&quot; Or, &quot;Oh,
                  there was a '70's? I thought it went from the '60's to the '80's.&quot; But
                  actually, it was a very restful and nice time. It was cool.</font></p>

                  often veer into diatribes or dated nonsense. It was interesting in your
                  comments during your reading at Northeastern that you said about
                  selecting the poems for <i>Abhorrences</i> that you had to throw out a
                  lot of them, because, &quot;It was just trash.&quot; How do you distinguish
                  between writing poetry that's true, but still has a political message,
                  and political vehemence?</font></p>
                <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ED DORN:</b> I think, in the case of <i>Abhorrences</i>,
                  the standard there was rather overwrought and a little too vicious and
                  a little like really getting a knife in. But then you could look at
                  this and say, &quot;But actually, the knife's into what, when it comes right
                  down to it?&quot; You're not separated enough from it. So I tended to choose
                  the things that got off a little bit, lowered the temperature on
                  things, got a little bit cold, a little high-minded, a little superior,
                  not too involved. That would have been the kind of things. Therefore,
                  less messy. A lot of stuff was just like this was spinning around some
                  kind of pointlessness or it's a rant pure and simple. One of the things
                  about political poetry is that you have to sort of imply to the reader
                  that this is a rather intimate situation in which I'm going to say
                  something that's rather stiff to you, and you're going to like it,
                  because actually you agree when it comes right down to it. You sort of
                  have to have the kind of--you just have to feel how you do that in a
                  poem. It's presumption, but it's with a kind of presumption that you
                  can't offend the reader with or alienate the reader into saying, &quot;Wow,
                  that IS a presumption.&quot; You have to include the reader.</font></p>
