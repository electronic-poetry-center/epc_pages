            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On my first night in the graduate poetry
              workshop with Edward Dorn at the University of Colorado, Ed began his
              weekly rant with the phrase &ldquo;looking back on the eighties&rdquo;&mdash;and followed
              it up with a cynical, but deadly accurate account of the writing that
              was on the Republican wall. The year was 1981. I marveled, in my
              innocence, at the moxie of one who would feign to know the contents of
              a decade that had only just begun, but I also became fatally attracted
              to the vigor of it, the nerve, focused in laser-like concentration on
              the Gipper and his ilk. To me, Ed was like one of the wrathful deities
              of Tibetan Buddhism: outwardly wrapped in robes of incinerating fire,
            but inwardly possessed of a core of compassion and tenderness.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I contemplate the thangka of his character
              now twenty-some years later, I see how much those years in Boulder were
              a constant jump on the griddle of Ed&rsquo;s mood. At one moment he might
              grace you with an almost confessional reverence, and in the next, turn
              and pour poison into your ear&mdash;and then forget he had done it. But we
              students of the nerve, acolytes of the naked dendrite, loved him in any
              case and willingly walked into the blaze to get whatever it was we
              thought he had. He was an entity, starving for attention, loud and
              total in his denunciations, ever-original, most thoroughly informed&mdash;and
              ultimately compassionate. His acumen was both his greatest strength and
              the source of what seemed to me his personal isolation and torment.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, from an outward point of view, he
              seemed unassailable. He was tall, well built, and had an implacable
              face with more crags than Guilin. Eliot Weinberger, perhaps referring
              more to his writing style than his physical appearance, had called him
  &ldquo;the Clint Eastwood of American poetry,&rdquo; an epithet he adored, and it
              surely fit the creased, heavy-jawed face. When he spoke, you listened
              like you would listen to a mountain. His voice prevailed, even when it
              went nasal, swollen sinuses betraying the heavy use of cocaine,
              alcohol, and tobacco. Indeed, he was such a picture of male confidence
              and individualism that I remember getting a tremor in my hands at the
              thought of calling him up on the phone. But call him I did, and knowing
              his predilections for whiskey, made it a habit of always inviting him
              out for drink. It was my way of getting him to look at my work, which
              under any other circumstances probably would never have happened. And
              so off to the Boulderado we would go, smokes and Dickle, poesy and Dos
              Eqis and lime.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;d read almost everything he&rsquo;d written. Like
              many readers, I fell in love with the early lyric poems, especially the
              sensitive &ldquo;Geranium,&rdquo; and became a careful imitator. (And I don&rsquo;t
              apologize for this.) I tried pushing the scale of my poetry, tried to
              envision a multi-page grandness of execution as he had done in long
              lyrics like &ldquo;From Idaho Out.&rdquo; One day, after a few sips of the
              requisite booze, I spread out some big sheets of rice paper on which I
              had typed (we used typewriters, then), a longish poem. He started to
              read it, and at some point I said something but he didn&rsquo;t hear me. I
              realized then how deeply he concentrated. And I learned never to
              interrupt him when he was reading because he simply wouldn&rsquo;t hear you.
              Finally, a moment came when we might be permitted to talk. He suggested
              I delete a line or two and I, foolish, objected, stating that &ldquo;I loved
              those lines.&rdquo;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;Well, the poem doesn&rsquo;t care about <i>you</i>,
              John,&rdquo; he said. The words cut their way into my dim brain, leaving a
              trail that can still be followed today. It was always like that:
              one-on-one we talked, drank, and I, neophyte Dorn-ophile groupie,
              learned. I earned my degree in the Boulderado Hotel.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We generally communicated through the haze and
              confusion of an almost continuous set of parties, nicely chilled by an
              illimitable polar expanse of cocaine. It didn&rsquo;t help matters that one
              student in the creative writing program was Ed&rsquo;s dealer, and this
              dealer liked to dish out freebies at parties. Naturally Ed&rsquo;s behavior
              altered into its Hyde state by the ingestion of so many drugs and so
              many drunken, buzzing devotees. Many of the parties were at Ed and
              Jenny&rsquo;s house, where the kids, (Kidd and Maya Dorn), went to their
              respective lairs and closed the doors to the thumping of the stereo and
              the loud banter of grad students and faculty. There was a certain
              pattern to these evenings that started with simple literary gossip and
              then eventuated into Ed&rsquo;s holding court at the central table of the
              dining room, eyes crunched into twin glints of anti-establishment
              asperity. He waxed long and hard on the evils of our empire, Ronald
              Reagan, and anything else that suited the moment. As the booze took
              root in his mind (and ours) his little pronunicamentos became more and
              more outlandish and puzzling, until someone finally had to call him on
              some especially bombastic claim&mdash;at which point he almost invariably
              became enflamed. Then his eyes squinted even more and his jaw jutted
              out. He would spit epithets and venom at anyone and everyone, except
              Jenny&mdash;usually&mdash;who hopelessly tried to rein him in. It was always at
              this point that the smart ones left the party. The rest of us were
              either too drunk to realize it was time to go home, or too much in love
              with the madness we saw exfoliating before us&mdash;and like moths to flame
              we flew in for the glory of the moment.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On one such night, Ed had been pleasant enough
              until he ran out of coke and none could be had. He started going crazy.
              The rage was quickly mounting. Then he found out from one schizy
              student (let&rsquo;s call him Greg) that I had a little envelope preserved in
              my pocket as tomorrow&rsquo;s birthday gift for a friend. There was a sudden
              flash of light, a shock wave, and then a profoundly uncomfortable
              burning sensation. At that moment the image of my skeleton was singed
              into the wall by a blast of carbonizing invective. (And here I had had
              the audacity to think that Ed liked me.) He wrote out a check then and
              there, gave it to me, with all the complacent aplomb of a paymaster of
              debauchery; I turned over the coke and the god&rsquo;s angry sinuses were
              appeased in an ensuing, sullen silence.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things healed over, but I learned to watch my
              step around Ed when he was drunk. While the rages could be
              entertaining, one certainly didn&rsquo;t want to be targeted for one of his
              sorties. If you knew him well enough, you could prick him with a few
              choice comments, bring up the spleen, then sit back and watch the
              fireworks from a safe distance. But gizzing Ed had occupational hazards
              associated with it, and sometimes innocents could be caught in the
              crossfire. One evening at the Boulderado Hotel, for example, a large
              herd of us had gathered to destroy our brain cells, and someone,
              knowing full well they were lighting dynamite, asked what Ed thought
              about one conspicuously gorgeous woman at the table. Ed replied in a
              voice loud enough to be heard and quiet enough to be denied, &ldquo;Yeah,
              she&rsquo;s great. I want to <i>fuck</i> her.&rdquo;  The table went daft with silence.  Was I supposed to learn how to write serious poetry from this person?</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Ed, life flourished where there was danger
              and he saw danger everywhere and forcibly contributed to it, driving
              under the influence at breakneck speeds around Boulder in his
              Mexican-made VW Thing, sans belts. (He was famous for his condemnations
              of airbags too, supporting of the idea that the fittest would survive.)
              But on another evening in my own efficiency apartment, crowded
              shoulder-to-shoulder with young writers, Ed holed up in the kitchen and
              showed off, juggling oranges. The tossed fruits began to scent the
              room, and suddenly he paused, catching them, holding them to his nose.
              In a moment that stood in stark contrast to the usual raving, he was
              calm, almost in a state of religious gratitude for the sweetness of
              oranges. Inhaling deeply, he said, with a sincerity that I could hardly
              correlate to his burning deity persona, &ldquo;Ah, doesn&rsquo;t it smell
              wonderful?&rdquo;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At one of our later t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes in the
              Boulderado, I tried to get at the essence of his dual nature. It was a
              ticklish sort of business. I wasn&rsquo;t a Tom Clark or a Peter Michelson,
              not a close friend and age-mate; I was just a student probing for a
              character&rsquo;s core. But as the evening wore on there came a revelation of
              sorts, though it must remain for his intimates to explain it. What he
              said to me was that he had felt guilty his whole life. Guilty for
              something he had done (with others, apparently) as a young man. He said
              he should have been &ldquo;put in prison&rdquo; for it, but as soon as I asked what
              he had done, the door flung shut and nothing could part it again. What
              was his &ldquo;crime&rdquo;? I never knew.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there was fear. It may come as a surprise to
              those who may only have experienced one of Ed&rsquo;s rages that this angry
              god was a terrified god too. When I look back at his almost legendary
              power of character and intellect, I see it more as a hedge against the
              onslaught on idiocy that was (and apparently still is) American
              politics. Once, visiting his house in calmer social weather, he told me
              how confounded he was by the simultaneous report of two national polls
              concerning Ronald Reagan: one proclaimed that most Americans believed
              Reagan had lied about the Iran-Contra Affair (no kidding) and the other
              reported that Americans approved of him. Ed, considering this from the
              little contemplative&rsquo;s writing shack he&rsquo;d built behind his house, said,
  &ldquo;The only thing you can conclude from that is that Americans <i>want</i> to be lied to.&rdquo; He was shocked. &ldquo;And I shocked that I&rsquo;m shocked,&rdquo; he
              said, because he knew better than to expect anything else. But his
              moral core, his tenderness, his compassion clawed at him and could
              never let him sink into utter jadedness. A world in which millions
              cheered for the &ldquo;Great Communicator,&rdquo; for &ldquo;Mr. Teflon,&rdquo; for Mr.
              Stroller-of-Nazi-cemeteries, (who, let us remember, ruthlessly funded
              the Contra insurrectionists), was a truly horrifying place for Ed. In a
              rare moment of candor about his own emotional reaction to the early
              80s, including the hysteria about the Sandinistas, he once confessed to
              Sidney Goldfarb (another member of the Boulder faculty) that he was so
              terrified he just wanted to run back to the 18th century. It made
              perfect sense to me. It would have been a natural fit for Ed. He was a
              great admirer of Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s enlightened mind and exalted
              rationality for its own peculiar aesthetic gleamings. He admired the
              relentless beauty of thought that was the Age of Reason.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But outwardly he spewed venom about Reagan and
              American imperialism with vehement disgust. When the &ldquo;Great
              Communicator&rdquo; was elected in 1980, Ed sat watching the returns with a
              few students, commenting on the motley crew of advisors and cabinet
              members: &ldquo;What a bunch of crooks!&rdquo; We were all too young to know the
  &ldquo;cabal of zealots,&rdquo; Edwin Meese, Donald Regan, Robert McFarlane, Elliot
              Abrams, Casper Weinberger, el al., but Ed knew. He had not forgotten
              history, a lesson learned well under the mentorship of Charles Olson.
              Within a few years, Reagan had doubled or tripled our national debt,
              evaded every effort to point out the idiocy of targeting the
              Sandinistas of El Salvador, helped create the Contras, (the opposing
              rightist guerillas in El Salvador), provided covert support for
              Guatemala&rsquo;s genocidal army in its destruction of Indians, and
              consistently rejected negotiated settlements between the opposing
              parties of El Salvador. </font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there were fears at home too. Ed was sure
              that students of the Naropa Institute, which at the time was a Tibetan
              Buddhist arts school essentially managed by Allen Ginsberg (with the
              blessing of Trungpa Rinpoche), were enrolling in Ed&rsquo;s poetry workshops
              with the express purpose of &ldquo;spying&rdquo; on him. The &ldquo;pods,&rdquo; (from &ldquo;Naropa
              Pods,&rdquo; thus &ldquo;Naro-pods&rdquo;) as he called them, were all around him. All of
              us dismissed this as part of a paranoid streak in Ed&rsquo;s personality, or
              perhaps even jealousy of Ginsberg&rsquo;s notoriety. In the poetry workshop
              on the evening of Reagan&rsquo;s swearing in, my mother-in-law-to-be
              (visiting the class) was accused of being a pod. &ldquo;This is my mother,&rdquo;
              explained my fianc&eacute;e, a student in the workshop. Without missing a
              beat, Ed replied, with obvious reference to Reagan&rsquo;s having just taken
              the oath of office, &ldquo;We should <i>all</i> have our mothers with us today.&rdquo;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet Ed could be the master of grace. I had
              asked Robert Creeley to come to the university to give a reading, and I
              offered him my apartment for a couple of days. That night, after the
              reading, the inevitable party at Ed and Jenny&rsquo;s became an
              uncompromising booze-o-rama. In the morning, therefore, when Ed and I
              were taking Creeley to the Denver airport, they both were shaking and
              sick. We sat in an airport tavern, staring dully at each other. I
              suggested a hair-of-the-dog, a grudgingly accepted alternative to what
              would have been a mute, hour-long tableau of day-after agony. Creeley
              dispatched, Ed and I drove back to Boulder, and captive in the car, Ed
              explained things to me as he had not done before. Chiefly, I remember
              asking him why he had changed his style so completely. Readers of
              Dorn&rsquo;s poetry know that there is a clear division between the early,
              lyric works and the later aphoristic material of books like <i>Hello, La Jolla</i>.
              I had always liked the early work much better and thought it was so
              much more a part of his character. Why did his writing style change so
              dramatically? &ldquo;I just got tired of it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Now all I want
              to do is write it quick and cashier it.&rdquo;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in Boulder, he invited me in for lunch. He
              snipped fresh marjoram from the garden and sprinkled it into bowls of
              tomato soup with crackers. I no longer remember what we talked about
              that day. The sun shone beautifully. We took our time. When I left, he
              walked me out the front door and there he saw a rose under the front
              window of his house, picked it, and gave it to me. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Take this. It&rsquo;s the last of the season.&rdquo;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Years later, I returned to Boulder with my wife
              Tandy Sturgeon and our baby son, Ben. Ed held the baby and played with
              him like a grandparent. Ben stared, fascinated, into the rocky face and
              patted it over and over. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mount Rushmore,&rdquo; said the poet, seeing
              himself seen from an infant&rsquo;s perspective. And then he put Ben on the
              floor. Ben was trying to learn how to crawl. Ed bent over him and moved
              the little limbs. Jenny intervened. &ldquo;Ed, you&rsquo;ve got to let him learn
              how to do it on his own.&rdquo;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Rushmore, &ldquo;you <i>gotta</i> help him.&rdquo; And there was an absolute certainty in that stone voice,
              like one who had lived, always in some way, sometimes with fire,
              sometimes with balm, to help others learn to crawl.</font></p>
