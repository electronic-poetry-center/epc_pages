            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1971 Ed Dorn came to San Francisco to
              read at a book fair held by Friends of Books and Comix. Here Dorn met a
              very simpatico pair in Holbrook Teter and Michael Myers who had just
              started their own imprint, Zephyrus Image press. The success of
              Zephyrus Image was due to the contrasting personalities of the
              principals. Teter, the unruffled scholar and rock-solid anchor, was a
              skilled typographer, while Myers was a crazy artist whose drinking
              exacerbated his diabetes. Dorn collected personalities like these and
              Myers was even more outrageous than Dorn needed to fire his
              imagination. Many of Michael's wild ideas were captured in the sayings
              of Dr Flamboyant, a character in <i>Gunslinger</i>. In an interview with Barry Alpert in <i>VORT</i> magazine you can sense Dorn's excitement at meeting the duo who would collaborate with him on <i>Bean News</i>, a real newspaper that rose out of the pages of <i>Gunslinger</i>.
              &quot;I think we have made the best newspaper in the world,&quot; he says. With
              help from Jeremy Prynne, Tom Clark, Tom Raworth, and a widening circle
              of connections, <i>Bean News</i> became one of the biggest in-jokes of
              the decade. The fact that only two issues saw the light of day added to
              the mystique of this legendary enterprise. Copies were printed on
              newsprint and also on bible tissue paper in imitation of the airmail
              edition of the Manchester Guardian. The participants were so enthralled
              with the project they created press credentials, sundry letterheads and
              notecards, and an array of ephemera to go along with their paper.</font>              </p>

      <div class="node"><div class="content">
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But this was not the only joint enterprise of
            the trio. Dorn saw to it that Teter &amp; Myers were invited to Kent
            State in 1974 for a creative arts festival. While there they produced a
            portfolio of poetry by Ed &amp; Jenny Dorn, Joanne Kyger, film-maker
            Samuel Fuller, Joel Oppenheimer, Devo, Ines Brolaski and Barbara
            Einzig. The two Dorn items, &quot;<a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/mesozoic">Mesozoic Landscape</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/green">Green Poems</a>&quot;
            are a complex of metal type, in many different styles arranged at
            angles, and include found art (Hitler shaking hand with a giant) &amp;
            Myers' linoleum cuts that replicate Dorn's writing as well as a brace
            with an arrow pointing to it.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in San Francisco the trio became neighbors,
            and their mutual meeting ground was either the print shop, Dorn's
            dining room, or the Pub, a former speakeasy on the corner of Geary and
            Masonic Boulevards, where editorial meetings were held with copious
            amounts of Irish coffee and other spirits. Among the many artists and
            writers on the scene were Bob &amp; Eileen Callahan whose Turtle Island
            Foundation was putting out a distinguished series of American writers
            including Zora Neal Hurston, Carl O. Sauer and Jaime De Angulo. Dorn
            was a great teacher of Callahan and gave them the manuscript of <i>Recollections of Gran Apacheria</i> which was turned into a comic book by Teter and Myers. Myers' drawing
            of the Opuntia Ellisana cactus, which adorned the cover of the hardback
            copies, was also used for a postcard announcing the book. On close
            inspection the cactus is made of ping-pong paddles.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zephyrus Image loved the Dadaistic look of found images that were liberally employed in their works. For <a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/semihard">a pamphlet containing two poems by Ed Dorn</a> plus two by George Kimball, they used a press photo of a kid stuffing a
            hot dog into his mouth. It had come from the junk pile of the Akron
            Beacon Journal, where the mother of Dorn's babysitter worked. She,
            Ellen Mann, retrieved the old discarded zinc cuts and fed them to the
            press. The title &quot;Semi-Hard&quot; added a salacious note to the image.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though Dorn returned to England to teach at the
            University of Essex, he was now deeply involved with Zephyrus Image.
            They were working on the collected <i>Gunslinger</i>, retitled <i>Slinger</i>,
            to be published by Wingbow Press (the publishing arm of small press
            distributor Bookpeople) in 1975. While Teter did the complex
            typesetting on his Linotype, Myers worked up several drawings (a cowboy
            shooting a jukebox, a horse smoking a bomber, etc) that, in the end,
            were not used (though the book does feature a peyote button drawn by
            Myers as a cul-de-lampe).</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For a Dorn reading at the University of Connecticut, Z I printed up an <a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/goddess">elegant broadside</a> of his &quot;Prolegomenon to Book IIII,&quot; adorned with an incredibly detailed
            linoleum cut by Myers of a Lady Caslon G, that has five tint blocks. It
            was apparently a portrait of Joanne Kyger.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, Teter began looking for property to
            share with the Dorns as they had decided to live together and start a
            writers commune with the press at the heart of it.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In retrospect this seems like a foolhardy idea
            as the personalities involved were too strong to be isolated in the
            pressure cooker atmosphere of a commune, but they did find a remote
            mountain-top property outside of Healdsburg in Sonoma County, a couple
            of hours north of San Francisco. Disaster struck as the press movers
            dropped the heavy Linotype machine on the treacherous road up to the
            ranch in spring 1976. Dorn was now teaching at U.C. San Diego in La
            Jolla and was driving his van up and down the length of the state to
            work, quite an achievement. While he drove he jotted down the poems
            that became <i>Hello, La Jolla</i> (I think he missed a great
            opportunity to title this book, &quot;Ahoy, La Jolla&quot;!), and when the book
            appeared, Z I printed a broadside of his poem &quot;Phaenominon&quot; with a
            linocut border by Myers.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another fine linocut image of Myers' was employed for Dorn's broadside &quot;<a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/octopus">The Octopus Thinks With Its Third Arm.</a>&quot;
            The trio were much more conscious of this as an elegant production and,
            for once, used handmade paper to print it on, adding their three names
            at the foot in Linotype Optima bold. The linocut of the octopus was
            printed in two colours so there are two states of this broadside.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At least two of the books from the press were
            collaborative efforts betwen Dorn, Teter and Myers. These are a spoof
            of fine printing, titled <i>The Menu Appendix Taken from William Caxton's Original Cookbook,</i> which looks like a plastic-covered menu from a cheap diner and contains
            lists of excruciating puns about printers, typefaces, and printing.
            (Remember Dorn had worked in a newspaper in his hometown, and ran the
            press at Black Mountain, so he was certainly able to keep up in this
            venture). The other work was a farewell blast at Dorn's teacher at
            Black Mountain College, Charles Olson. The first sign of unrest was Tom
            Raworth's broadside, &quot;The Auction of Olson's Head,&quot; which the press ran
            off in a very small quantity in 1975. In 1976 they followed this with a
            flip-book titled <i>Folgers,</i> the cover looking like the label on a
            can of Folger's coffee (the rather tenuous conection is that Folger's
            coffee had a spokeswoman named Mrs Olsen and their slogan was &quot;It's
            Mountain Grown). Or mountain groan, in this case. Inside is a flip book
            (one of several made by the press), showing Charles Olson in front of a
            weather map of the United States rubbing his forefinger up and down
            over his lip in the &quot;beeble-deeble&quot; gesture adults sometimes make to
            amuse babies. A lot of work went into this one-liner joke, but it was
            executed with all the care and attention Zephyrus Image lavished on
            their many other works.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a bibliographer my task was complicated by
            the state of some of the items I discovered in the press' archives.
            Zephyrus Image was fond of humble materials, like newsprint, and
            unusual formats. Dorn had been working on a film script, at the behest
            of Stan Brakhage, entitled &quot;Abilene! Abilene!&quot; and the press did
            produce this work in galley-proof format. But there are no copies as
            far as I know outside the archives, indicating it was not formally
            published. However it would not be unusual for it to have come from the
            press in this intermediary state: a trial printing as it were. Or it
            may well be that the work got this far and stopped because of perennial
            lack of funds, while paying jobs were brought to the fore. A third
            issue of <i>Bean News</i> was typeset (37 galleys exist for it) and
            the complex mass of material had been assembled into trial page
            formats. This took place during the move and the fallout of their close
            working relations that put an end to the enterprise.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People who visited the quartet on the mountain
            have differing views of the tensions that waxed between the men. It's a
            safe bet that Jenny Dorn took the brunt of it, as she was very close to
            Michael, but also didn't relish the little woman in the kitchen role,
            in addition to being the one driving the kids up and down the mountain
            to school, fetching water, shopping, and all the other chores that were
            amplified by the remoteness of their situation. After a year the
            mountaintop scene was so brittle that the Dorns fled as Myers emptied a
            shotgun in the direction of their departing vehicle.</font></p>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, through Ed the Zephyrus Imagists had
            connected with some important writers, like Robert Creeley, Fielding
            Dawson, Tom Raworth, and Lucia Berlin, and ZI published booklets by all
            of these writers, in addition to Bly's translations of Rilke, and books
            by Stan Brakhage, William T. Wiley, and others.</font></p>
