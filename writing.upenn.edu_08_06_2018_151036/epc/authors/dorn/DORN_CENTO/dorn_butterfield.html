            <p align="left" class="centotitle"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>This commemorative talk on Dorn was given
              shortly after his death by Herbie Butterfield to staff and students of
              the Department of Literature at the University of Essex in England,
              where Dorn had taught intermittently between 1965 and 1975. It is
              precisely that, a commemorative talk rather than a scholarly paper or
              article, and is published here exactly as it was delivered, with no
              attempt to correct any inaccuracies or misunderstandings, if such there
            be.</i></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a talk about a person who was first
              a good friend of mine, albeit of late I had seen him only on some of
              his occasional trips to England; who was also formerly a departmental
              colleague; who over the years was a teacher or writer in residence at a
              number of universities; who was an unrelentingly watchful social and
              political critic; who with Gordon Brotherston of this Department was a
              translator of Native and Latin American poetry: and who above all of
              course was a poet. I wish to say something about him, less or more, in
              all of those facets, having in mind that several of you will also be
              remembering him personally, that some of you may know the work but not
              the man, whilst others may know nothing of him whatsoever. Hence, a
              memoir for a few; an introduction for some; an attempt at an overview
            for others; perhaps a hodegepodge for all.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centotitle2"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ed Dorn and the Essex Poetry Scene</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before talking about Dorn himself, I shall
              say something of how he first came to the Department of Literature,
              back in 1965, the Department's second year of existence. The story, a
              creation story, will be superfluously familiar to some of you here, but
              not to others; and since it ought not to be lost, it can do with
              retelling every now and again.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Department's founding professor was the
              previously Cambridge-based poet, translator, and literary critic,
              Donald Davie. In the 1950s he had established his reputation as a
              neoclassical critic and poet of what was known as The Movement, the
              anti-romantic, anti-apocalyptic, or simply anti-Dylan Thomas Movement,
              within which Davie was associated with other Movement poets such as
              Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis, and Thom Gunn, later each to go his very
              separate way. By the early 1960s Davie's way had taken him to an
              interest in the American high modernist, Ezra Pound, and to the
              publication in 1964, his first full year at Essex, of his Ezra Pound:
              Poet as Sculptor. Davie's first appointment was the Californian, George
              Dekker, who had also published a book on Pound, Sailing after
              Knowledge. Davie furthermore brought with him from Cambridge several
              doctoral students working on various aspects of American modernism.
              They included Elaine Feinstein, soon to be better known as a novelist,
              but at that time chiefly a poet and also the recipient of Charles
              Olson's widely circulated and seminal statement of poetics, &quot;Letter to
              Elaine Feinstein.&quot; They included Andrew Crozier, later to share a
              Paladin volume of Selected Poems with Davie, and to edit one of the
              best anthologies of contemporary British Poetry, the aesthetically
              ideological A Various Art. Crozier had already in the early 1960s
              discovered a campaigning interest in the then wholly overlooked
              American Objectivists of the 1930s, both modernist and Marxist they had
              been. One of these, Carl Rakosi, had stopped writing in 1939. His
              volume, Amulet, of 1967, is dedicated &quot;To Andrew Crozier who wrote the
              letter which started me writing again.&quot; And Davie's doctoral students
              included also Tom Clark, at that time poetry editor of the Paris
              Review, on his way to becoming prolific poet, novelist, omniscient
              celebrant of baseball, exposer on the literary scene of crackpot fake,
              and biographer (of Olson, Jack Kerouac, Damon Runyon, and
              prospectively, I understand, of Ed Dorn). Jeremy Prynne, although he
              never left Cambridge, may also be mentioned here, in part because it
              was on his learned advice that the bases of the Essex library's
              extensive holdings in American poetry were established, and because
              Prynne had already become Dorn's earliest British contact and
              correspondent.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether it was through Prynne or Clark or
              through his own reading that Davie came upon Dorn I don't know, but by
              1965 he was appreciatively reviewing Dorn's recently published volume,
              Geography, and in the autumn of that year at his invitation Dorn joined
              the Department as a Fulbright lecturer, to be here on and off for five
              of the next ten years. It was through Dorn that his friend, Tom
              Raworth, became attached to the Department between 1967 and 1971 -
              Raworth, who takes his place in the anthology of American poets, 20 +
              1, 20 American poets plus the one Englishman, Raworth, whom the editors
              thought too integral a part of the American scene to omit. Raworth's
              close friend, Ted Berrigan, the leading figure of the New York School
              of the 1960s and 70s, spent what many of his students found to be a
              memorable and personally formative year in the Department in 1973-4.
              And Berrigan had followed the most famous American visitor of all, who
              came to the Department at the invitation not of Davie, but of his
              successor in the Chair, Philip Edwards. This visitor, a member of the
              Department for three years between 1970 and 1973, was Robert Lowell,
              generally regarded at the time as the major living American poet,
              though working out of a rather different poetics from most of those
              that Davie had attracted. During these years, in addition to such
              longer-term presences, many leading American poets came to the
              Department to read and talk about their work, for without doubt the
              Department of Literature here was then the chief outpost for the study
              of American poetry in this country and perhaps outside the North
              American continent. Charles Olson came, Lowell's fellow New Englander,
              the two opposing champions of the American writing scene they appeared
              at that time; and Galway Kinnell; and Louis Simpson; and during the 70s
              and into the 80s, often through the heroic efforts of Joe Allard for
              his festival, there came Robert Creeley (twice), and Carl Rakosi, and
              Wendell Berry, and Gary Snyder, and Denise Levertov; and then in 1990,
              ten years ago to this week, to grace the Department's quartercentenary
              celebrations, there returned Donald Davie and Ed Dorn, both now
              departed.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These communal Departmental reminders have been
              a nostalgic but also, as it seems to me, proper and necessary
              preliminary before I remember Dorn in his singularity, as I now do.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centotitle2"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The road to Black Mountain</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ed Dorn was born in April 1929, in Villa
              Grove, a small railroad town in Illinois, 100 miles or so South of
              Chicago. His grandfather had worked on the railroads, and railroad
              lore, as in folklore, and law, as in rule, came to pervade his writing
              and thinking, whether in a predominantly realist short story like
  &quot;C.B.&amp; Q&quot; (C.B.&amp;Q for the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy line)
              or in a polemical poem like &quot;The Sundering U.P.Tracks&quot; (U.P for the
              Union Pacific railroad). Amongst the books that he gave me on returning
              to the States one time and that I continue to treasure is John Stover's <i>American Railroads</i>, and Donald Wesling, another former colleague
              here, recalls Dorn opening a course in literature thus: &quot;He remained
              silent, thumbing through various volumes, and the students became
              restless, gazing at one another and wondering why he did not speak.
              After a prolonged silence he grasped a roll of paper beside him and
              rose from his chair. Leaning forward, he proceeded to unroll a map of
              the United States across a large expanse of table. It wasn't a
              political map or a topographical map or a road map, but a railroad map.
              'This is our area,' he said with a smile.&quot; His natural father he never
              knew, the paternal presence in his life from early childhood on being
              his stepfather, an agricultural worker and farm machinery mechanic.
              With his mother, as he said in an interview in 1973, &quot;I've always had a
              very good relationship, I respect her very, very much.&quot; Characteristic
              of Dorn, I think, rather than 'love,' that restrained and essentially
              moral 'respect.' Respect, tenderness, pity, understanding inform the
              poem I shall first read, a recollection of the hard-pressed lives of
              those, like his parents, who <i>worked</i> but did not <i>own</i> the
              bountiful land, a poem in which an implicit, wholesale critique of
              mail-order ethics is briefly held in check by a pragmatic recognition
              of the temporary benefits and relief.</font></p>

              what was evidently a return visit home with his own now young children.
              It reminds one that in the first instance Dorn comes out of the same
              broad Middle West as Willa Cather, Sherwood Anderson, Wright Morris,
              Carl Sandburg, and closest to hand Vachel Lindsay, whose &quot;Bryan, Bryan,

              It's with that basic identification that Dorn begins and where
              essentially in sympathy he stays.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaving high school in 1947, he began several
              years of roaming, to Los Angeles, up to Seattle in Washington State to
              work in the Boeing plant there, back home to work in a tractor factory
              in Shelbyville, two years at the University of Illinois where the
              important figure for him, and &quot;for all my life since then,&quot; was his art
              teacher, Ray Obermayr, who was the first to spot in him some special
              gift and who pointed him in the direction of Black Mountain College in
              North Carolina, which he first attended for a year in 1951, and where
  &quot;I felt very country in the face of [the other students with their]
              city expression and sophistication,&quot; especially as &quot;I don't think I'd
              ever met a person from the eastern part of the U.S.&quot; before that. &quot;The
              East - the eastern United States - was Europe as far as I was
              concerned.&quot; After that initial year at Black Mountain it was back West,
              to Kansas, Wyoming, and again to Seattle and the forests around, where
              he employed his talents as a carpenter and like Gary Snyder and Ken
              Kesey at the same time came upon remnants of that early-century
              North-Western radicalism, working amongst &quot;loggers who had been
              Wobblies and people in the woods who had been trained by Marxist
              Unions.&quot; Here too he met his first wife, Hel&Euml;ne, who was to be the
              mother of his three older children, Fred, Shanie (Chansonette), and
              Paul. This life, itinerant, socially marginal, either backwoods rural
              or ramshackle, down-town urban, is the stuff of his early prose
              fiction, of stories like &quot;Ist Avenue,&quot; &quot;C.B.&amp;Q,&quot; and &quot;Driving
              across the Prairie,&quot; and of his novel, <i>The Rites of Passage</i>, which was republished in 1971 as <i>By the Sound</i>, the title that he himself preferred, because &quot;it's not a middle-class novel and I was not a middle-class person, [but <i>Rites of Passage</i>]
              is a middle-class title,&quot; being a cultural term more familiar to the
              educated elite than to &quot;the people that I drew my story from {and
              wished] to pay homage to,&quot; those who simply lived <i>By the Sound</i>,
              which is to say Puget Sound, the long, narrow inlet of Pacific water by
              which Seattle stands. Dorn's prose of these years is characteristically
              plain, vernacular, demotic, at ease, as he recreates a world of
              drifters, railroad wanderers, casual workers, cabin and trailer
              dwellers, loggers, fishermen, hunters, bar and tavern drinkers, men and
              women both, white, Indian, and mixed-race, with himself, evidently Carl
              Wyman in <i>By the Sound</i>, very much amongst them, not watching
              from apart; and never a necktie to be seen. The kind of the writing,
              its rural or wilderness settings and the human subjects and conditions
              it depicts, has as literary antecedents the Hemingway of <i>In Our Time</i>, the Steinbeck of <i>Cannery Row</i>, Faulkner at his less ornate, in &quot;The Old Man&quot; sections of <i>The Wild Palms</i>, for instance. But broadly accessible, loosely realist prose fiction was not the way Dorn was to go.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The way he was to go took him first in 1954 back
              to Black Mountain. Although Black Mountain existed as a college for
              only a little over 20 years between 1933 and 1956, it had an impact
              upon American intellectual and artistic culture out of all proportion
              to its size and duration. Pedagogically experimental, socially
              libertarian, intellectually demanding and elitist, but oppositionist
              and heterodox, its dominating presences were in the earlier years, the
              abstract painter and modernist theorist, Joseph Albers, former teaching
              member of the Bauhaus and refugee from Nazi Germany, and from 1948
              until its closure, Charles Olson, the historical and speculative
              thinker and poet at the cusp of modernism and postmodernism. Dozens and
              dozens were the artists and writers of achievement who came to and from
              Black Mountain as teachers or students, especially during Olson's
              rectorship; I'll mention only a representative score. The composer,
              John Cage; the choreographer, Merce Cunningham; the film director,
              Arthur Penn, probably still best known for <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>;
              the architect, Buckminster Fuller; the painters, Willem de Kooning,
              Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, and Robert Rauschenberg; the literary
              critics and social thinkers Edward Dahlberg, Paul Goodman, and Alfred
              Kazin; the prose fiction-writers, Fielding Dawson and Michael Rumaker;
              and the poets Robert Duncan, Hilda Morley, Joel Oppenheimer, John
              Wieners, Robert Creeley, Charles Olson himself, and of course Ed Dorn.
              Black Mountain was an extraordinary American phenomenon. Short though
              was the time he spent there, paying his way by carpentry and printing
              work, its impact on Dorn was profound and pervasive, which is to say
              the impact of his principal teachers, Olson and Creeley. Olson gave him
              his theoretical base, his reading list, literally, in the shape of
              Olson's later published &quot;A Bibliography on America for Ed Dorn,&quot; his
              range of reference for lifelong use, and his radical self-confidence.
              Creeley's influence was something narrower, purer, more essentially
              poetic. I hear it in &quot;The Rick of Green Wood,&quot; not Creeley's voice, but
              his exquisite ear for the smallest elements of language and his
              miniaturist artistry. Or as Creeley himself put it: Dorn has &quot;an ear
              that hears the weights and rhythms of sound as clearly as either wind
              or water might make them.&quot; It is placed first in both Dorn's <i>Collected</i> and <i>Selected Poems</i> and dated beneath, 1956, as none of his other poems are, as if to say &quot;this is the beginning of my work.&quot;</font></p>

              his contemporaries or immediate seniors, associated with the
              overlapping cultural groups of Beat Generation and San Francisco
              Renaissance - Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure,
              Gary Snyder, Jack Spicer, and William Everson (Brother Antoninus at the
              time) - and metaphorically presiding over these his godchildren, as to
              his irritation they were sometimes called, would have been Kenneth
              Rexroth, with down the coast the brooding figure of Robinson Jeffers.
              I've worked extensively on Jeffers over the years so was pleased to
              hear Ed accord to him one of his highest terms of praise: &quot;Jeffers, oh,
              he's elegant!&quot; - a description surely not so much of Jeffers's literary
              style as of his existential stance. </font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thence to New Mexico, the time now the late
              1950s, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, &quot;working as an assistant to a reference
              librarian, one of the most interesting jobs I ever had,&quot; and Taos,
              where haunted the shades of Haniel Long, Mary Austin, Mabel Dodge Luhan
              and D.H.Lawrence. I don't think he was ever much interested in the
              early English Lawrence but for the American Lawrence and the observer
              of nature, of birds, beasts, and flowers, he had always the highest
              regard. In a piece written for the London Observer in 1990 he described
              Lawrence's nature writings as &quot;a chastisement for the loose thinking
              which passes for 'ecology'&quot; today and as being &quot;the most comprehensive
              reflection on our responsibilities to other creatures.&quot; And surely the
              opening line of &quot;Los Mineros,&quot; a poem about the dead of a New Mexico
              mining disaster, &quot;Now it is winter and the fallen snow,&quot; is a conscious
              echo of the first line of Lawrence's awesome, preparatory &quot;The Ship of
              Death:&quot; &quot;Now it is autumn and the falling fruit/and the long journey
              towards oblivion.&quot; But the most important, the most enduring legacy of
              his years in New Mexico, and originally perhaps again in part a debt to
              Lawrence and certainly to Haniel Long and Mary Austin, was the
              foundation of his scholarly knowledge of and moral, spiritual, and
              political commitment to Native American peoples, their histories,
              mythologies, and cultures. This was to find expression here and there
              throughout his writings but concertedly in the prose-work with
              photographs, <i>The Shoshoneans</i> of 1966, in the volume of poetry, <i>Reflections of Gran Apacheria</i> of 1974, and in the translations with Gordon Brotherston from the
              Nahuatl, the Maya, and the Quechua, collected from the work of three
              decades and published in 1999 under the title, <i>The Sun Unwound: Original Texts from Occupied America</i>.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was not until 1960, when he was already in
              his early thirties, that Dorn published his first separate work, the
              essay, &quot;What I See in <i>The Maximus Poems</i>,&quot; - <i>The Maximus Poems</i> being the vast epic, in the line of Pound's <i>Cantos</i> and Williams's <i>Paterson</i>, upon which Olson had been at work for many years. <i>The Maximus Poems</i> are rooted in Olson's home town, the fishing port of Gloucester,
              Massachusetts, which provided Dorn with the title, &quot;From Gloucester
              Out,&quot; of the grateful and thoughtful and beautiful homage to his tutor
              and mentor that he also composed at this time. A year later in 1961 his
              first 'slim volume' of poems, <i>The Newly Fallen</i>, was published
              by Totem Press. This was a press run by LeRoi Jones, later to be known
              as Amiri Baraka, the black poet, theatre writer, revolutionary
              polemicist, and political activist. Dorn and he had recently become the
              closest of friends, who for many years engaged in a no-holds-barred
              correspondence about writing, art, and politics in these years when the
              Civil Rights Movement was looking to wear the bolder shade of Black
              Power and when the U.S. was embarking on its forty-year quest to
              undermine and overthrow the Cuban Revolution. Jones's Totem Press
              invites me to mention the fact that throughout his life Dorn preferred
              to be published by small, dedicated presses rather than the big,
              commercial houses: thus, Jones's Totem Press, Harvey Brown's Frontier
              Press, Black Sparrow, Grey Fox, and in England Gael Turnbull's Migrant
              Press, Stuart Montgomery's Fulcrum, and Nicholas Johnson's Etruscan
              Books.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1961 the Dorns moved a thousand miles or so
              north from New Mexico to Pocatello, Idaho, where he taught at Idaho
              State University for four years until 1965 and worked on the poems that
              were to appear in <i>Geography</i>. <i>Geography</i> was dedicated &quot;To
              Charles Olson,&quot; and in its title and general conception, though less so
              in individual poems, the volume may seem to be the summation and the
              culmination of Dorn's debt to Olson, the man who foregrounded geography
              in his understanding of the human story and who famously opened <i>Call Me Ishmael</i>, his marvellous short book on Melville's <i>Moby-Dick</i>:
  &quot;I take SPACE to be the central fact to man born in America....I spell
              it large because it comes large here. Large, and without mercy. It is
              geography at bottom, a hell of wide land from the beginning.&quot; Well,
              that sense certainly underlies and coordinates Dorn's volume. But it is
              an altogether diverse volume too, in which no less than sixteen of the
              thirty five poems are simply entitled song or have song in their
              titles; love songs to his wife, Hel&egrave;ne, and for his children; laments;
              cris de coeur; songs of both political endeavour and political anger.
              Though Dorn was to be first and foremost a public and political poet,
              he always held to a conception of poem as song, albeit &quot;language-song
              rather than music-song,&quot; as he idiosyncratically differentiated, and in
              the 1970s for his second wife, Jenny, he was to put out two volumes, <i>24 Love Songs</i>, and <i>Songs, Set Two: A Short Count</i>.
              The poem that I first want to read, though, is not a song but a letter,
              a public letter, of solace and solidarity. It remains for me an
              exemplary poem of its kind, but I also want to read it for the personal
              reason that it was the first of his poems that took my eye and the
              first of his poems that I in any sense 'taught' - a year before I came
              to Essex, when I was working at the University of Wales in Aberystwth
              and conducting a specialist course in American poetry, which would
              meet, in the sometimes manner of those days, in the back bar of the
              Bellevue Hotel.</font></p>

              year Dorn came to Essex, to live successively in Lexden village, within
              sound &quot;of the rookery in Lexden churchyard,&quot; as one of his poems
              remembers, then at 6 Victoria Road, back of the Royal Grammar School,
              in what was veritably a poet's house, as it passed from the Northern
              Irish poet, Bill Rodgers, to the Dorns, and thence to Tom and Val
              Raworth, and then in a large Victorian house at Ardleigh next to the
              railway crossing. Penny and I first met him and Hel&Euml;ne in the summer of
              1966 by arrangement in the Wagon and Horses at the top of North Hill,
              when it was a nice, old-fashioned place with several small bars and
              before it became the preferred watering-hole of the Durham Light
              Infantry. We all got on, hit it off immediately, one of those rare,
              charmed occurrences. I think the University gets only one mention in
              his poetry: &quot;I shifted deftly out of the window/of the new university,
              the english workers/saunter easily building this thing.&quot; I love that
              materiality, the university as, first, cut down to size, another
  &quot;thing.&quot; But he was wholly committed to his courses and his teaching
              and without doubt became for a number of his students the most
              important, formative influence upon their later intellectual lives.
              This January, after Ed's death, there came to me from Germany, where
              one of them, Dave Cook, has been living for many years, a four-page
              letter of grateful reminiscence, all of thirty years on, which
              concludes: &quot;he was a truly, very, very bright star.&quot; The American
              literature teaching at that time was shared between Ed, George Dekker,
              and myself, and was organized on both a generic and a regional basis,
              with the genre courses being focussed on the nineteenth century, on the
              work therefore mainly of New Englanders and New Yorkers. In the
              share-out, George took the South and non-fictional prose, I the Middle
              West and fiction, and Ed the Far West and poetry. Ed's exam questions
              usually had to be reset. They really were very mysterious, along the
              lines of - I vaguely remember one- &quot;what connections are there between
              Whitman's poetics and General Westmoreland's military strategy in
              Vietnam,&quot; which was doubtless amended to &quot;Whitman was quite a good
              poet. Discuss.&quot; Give and take, I suspect that what he in turn most
              gained from working in this Department was the eighteenth century, the
              largely eighteenth-century Enlightenment course being even then the
              foundation course of the School of Comparative Studies, and Donald
              Davie's strongest scholarly suit being always the eighteenth century,
              on which throughout his life he continued to write with such
              extraordinary clarity and perspicacity. In any event, the major writers
              of that century were to become the English writers for whom Dorn felt
              most affinity - Swift, Pope, Johnson above all, and Byron, if we can
              corral Byron into that century as the most Augustan of the romantics.
              Indeed Dorn has been described by one critic as &quot;Swift trapped in a
              democracy.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The volume that came out of Dorn's time at Essex and in England was <i>The North Atlantic Turbine</i>,
              published in 1967. It was a volume with which he later said he came to
              feel &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; perhaps because it is the only volume of his that
              emanates from outside the American West. As he wrote for the blurb on
              the jacket: &quot;In <i>The North Atlantic Turbine</i> . . . I have tried
              to locate another hemisphere. And I want this collection to be the last
              necessity to work out such locations. . . . Off shore I have missed my
              country for the first time,&quot; - then, lest we mistake this for the
              beginnings of any sort of booster patriotism, &quot;thanks to an increase of
              bad news&quot; from there. So these are poems about being an American in
              England, an often humorously bemused journey of probing exploration and
              discovery, broadly in the tradition, I remember Donald Davie once
              remarking, of Hawthorne's <i>English Notebooks</i> and James's <i>English Hours</i>, though I find Dorn's tone to be closer to that of Henry Adams's <i>Education</i>.
              And they are poems too, as the title of the volume means to imply,
              about a world, a globe, driven over the centuries by the engine of the
              North Atlantic nations, European and American, the turbine of trade and
              money and power and domination. Dorn made a recording of a number of
              poems from this volume, and to give you the sound of the man and a
              flavour of his mind and his work at this time I'll play, first, a
              section from the sequence, &quot;Oxford,&quot; taken by Dorn reasonably enough to
              be, along with Cambridge, one of the quintessences of England; and
              secondly, the volume's final poem, whose setting and concerns are
              wholly North American. </font></p>

            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the year of <i>The North Atlantic Turbine's</i> publication, 1967, Dorn also began the writing of what was to be his
              longest work, eventually a book-length single poem in four parts, his
  &quot;American Epic,&quot; in the line of Hart Crane's <i>The Bridge</i>, Williams's <i>Paterson</i>, Olson's <i>Maximus Poems</i>. This was <i>Gunslinger</i>, often referred to in abbreviated form as <i>Slinger</i>,
              whose parts appeared successively between 1968 and 1975, as Dorn lived
              and worked peripatetically in Colchester back and forth, in Kansas,
              Chicago, San Francisco, and Ohio. He and Hel&egrave;ne had parted by now, and
              he had remarried an Essex literature student, Jennie Dunbar, mother of
              his two younger children, Kidd and Maya. And just as continual movement
              and radical change were the tenor of his life during these years, so is <i>Gunslinger</i> all movement and a change of poetic character.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I suppose it is <i>Gunslinger</i> for which Dorn
              is now best known; certainly it's the work of his that has attracted
              most critical attention and analysis; and whether it's his finest
              achievement or not, it's undoubtedly his most substantial. My
              difficulty is that, though I admire its brilliance and enjoy reading it
              at a fast trot, I don't feel in any sort of command talking about it,
              or just trying to say crisply - for those of you who don't know it -
              what it is and what it does. It's an epic, a western, an allegory, a
              satire, a burlesque, a parable, a songbook, a philosophical
              deconstruction, a political fantasy, a running joke, a picaresque
              ramble through New Mexico and Nevada, which are less place or setting
              than stage for endless talk. Like Burroughs's <i>The Naked Lunch</i>,
              with which it may be usefully associated, it is infused with drugs,
              grass in the first book, acid in the second, coke in the third and
              fourth. Said Dorn in an interview, &quot;the drugs are like the facade or
              the molding on the building.&quot; Its characters, a few of whom retain an
              individual integrity, whilst others coalesce, separate, exchange
              identities, and reform, include the Gunslinger; Lil the whorehouse
              madam; Lady Jane the nominal embodiment of marijuana; a talking horse,
              either cigar-smoking or stoned; Claude L&Egrave;vi-Strauss; Heidegger; Kool
              Everything; Dr. Flamboyant; Portland Bill; Tonto Pronto from Toronto;
              Parmenides, the pre-Socratic philosopher; Howard Hughes, acting for the
              power and madness of capitalism, also called RobArt; the Poet, not Ed
              Dorn personally, but the representative, generic poet; and I, who again
              is not I, Ed Dorn, but either the ego or the first-person pronoun, and
              whose death is at one time announced: &quot;What happened to I she asked/his
              eyes dont seem right. I is dead, the Poet said.&quot; But not to worry
              unduly, I is soon brought back, if not to life, to usage. For want of
              something succinct and coherent to say about <i>Gunslinger</i>, I'm
              going to take the wimpish way out and have two others speak for me.
              First, Donald Davie on its manner: &quot;a jokey poem, high-spirited and
              good-tempered, carried forward on a steadily inventive play of puns and
              pleasantries.&quot; Secondly, Tom Clark: &quot;The
              anti-post-industrial-capitalist mock-epic, <i>Gunslinger</i>, is an
              ambitious, multi-voiced allegorical narrative, [which] plays off pop
              song and cowboy ballad in assembling an outrageous outlaw metaphysics,
              extravagantly updating pre-Socratic philosophies and the myths of
              comic-book gunman and Hollywood/TV frontier hero to fit the
              subjectivist ethics of the Vietnam-era drug culture.&quot; So there you have
              it! If you're curious, read it, it rattles along.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simultaneously with the completion of <i>Gunslinger</i> in 1974 appeared <i>Recollections of Gran Apacheria</i>,
              whose grotesque, comic-book cover-drawing by Dorn's friend, Michael
              Myers, wittily belies the often solemn nature of the proceedings
              within. For it is a volume with a single, concentrated purpose: to pay
              homage to the Apaches and their heroic chiefs, Victorio and Geronimo,
              to celebrate their nobility, &quot;not in themselves/so much as in their
              Ideas,&quot; and to mourn their defeat, dispossession, and enforced exile.
              I'll read its final, elegiac poem.</font></p>

            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1977 Dorn took up a teaching-post at the
              University of Colorado at Boulder, which turned out to be a permanent
              place of settlement, a home, first in Boulder, latterly in Denver. Over
              the next decade or so he issued four volumes of poetry, <i>Hello, La Jolla</i>; <i>Yellow Lola</i>; <i>Captain Jack's Chaps</i>; and in 1990 <i>Abhorrences</i>,
              a sort of daybook of the 1980s, the Reagan years. The poems throughout
              these volumes are broadly of a kind, a kind that may indeed call in
              question by some their status as poems. Well, is this a poem? &quot;I'd live
              on the Moon/if the commute were/a little less.&quot; Or this, entitled
  &quot;Permission Refused:&quot; &quot;I used to say Frisco all the time -/but now that
              it's OK, I'll stop.&quot; To which Dorn might reply, and did: &quot;I'm writing
              shorter and shorter pieces, which I'm not interested in calling
              anything, and I don't mean poems, but I mean anything. And yet I'm
              interested in formulating what the function of them might be.&quot; He'd
              never been much interested in defining poetry or distinguishing between
              kinds of writing generally. Back in 1960 he'd written: &quot;The distinction
              as to whether a thing is verse or poetry, or indeed prose bores me;&quot;
              and elsewhere that there was little difference between poetry and prose
              or even poetry and talk. Maybe poetry was just rhetorically aware
              writing, sometimes rhythmic and variously moving, as in motion or
              emotion, sometimes just a fast shot, hitting or missing. What he knew
              was that he was a writer, a poet, and the poet's job, the job of the
              political poet he had now so completely become, was to speak of and to
              and for the polis and to witness, monitor, mock, expose, abjure. Thus
              came these 'things,' some of them much more like 'poems' than others,
              and a few of which I've photocopied for the handout, - things whose
              function, in which Dorn said he was interested, is ....well, very
              traditional, to instruct or to please or to move, to anger or laughter
              or disdain. They're essentially aphoristic and epigrammatic, and one
              reader, Alan Golding, has interestingly compared and contrasted them
              with the formally strict epigrams of the the age's leading
              epigrammatist, J.V.Cunningham. Cunningham and Dorn are of course very
              different kinds of poet, but share, as Golding observes, &quot;abstract
              diction and acerbic wit.&quot; Our colleague, Jack Hill has written well of
              Cunningham as one of nature's Romans, whilst of himself Dorn had early
              written: &quot;My desire is to be/a classical poet.&quot; So perhaps they're not
              so far apart after all.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some respects Dorn's poetic output of these
              years may be seen as but an adjunct to his principal activity which, in
              equal partnership with his wife, Jennie, was the editing, running,
              financing, and supervisory organization of <i>Rolling Stock</i>. <i>Rolling Stock</i> - still that railroad reference - was a 24 to 42 page newspaper that
              appeared twice a year between 1981 and 1991. This was neither a journal
              nor a magazine, but a newspaper - that was the format it had, and that
              was the kind of thing it was. Dorn had always been interested in the
  &quot;idea of a newspaper,&quot; as, say, Cardinal Newman had been interested in
              the &quot;idea of a university,&quot; and a decade before, as an accompanying
              sidenote to <i>Gunslinger</i>, he had issued just one number of <i>Bean News</i>, a sort of esoteric tabloid. <i>Rolling Stock</i> was altogether more substantial, and as a from-first-to-last
              subscriber, I found it, as it reached me here in Colchester, the best
              newspaper around - seriously! Ed and Jennie did a great deal of the
              writing, but there were twenty or so other regular correspondents and
              contributors, of whom I'll mention only those with any sort of Essex
              connection: Tom Clark, who was literary editor, Tom Raworth, Jeremy
              Prynne, Gordon Brotherston, Nick Sedgwick, a former student here who
              wrote a splendid golf column, and Woody Haut, a doctoral student of Jim
              Philip's in the early 1980s, as I recall, who sent articles from London
              on Tony Benn and Ken Livingstone, amongst others. In terms of foreign
              coverage, <i>Rolling Stock</i> was especially good on Latin America
              and the various oppositionist and guerilla struggles there, in
              Argentina, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, Chile. Native American
              conditions and causes in both the U.S. and Canada featured large, and
              all kinds of challenge to the dominant forces of the Reagan/Bush
              Republican era. How to give any sense of its idiosyncrasy and
              variousness? - well, just to say I remember enjoying in particular
              pieces on the Cowboy Poetry festival in Elko, Nevada; on the Havana
              film festival; on the fifteenth-century Scottish poet, William Dunbar;
              on C.L.R.James, nicely entitled, in furthest Colorado, remember,
  &quot;Marxist Cricketer;&quot; a whole special number in 1989 on the crumbling
              Soviet Union; and the several tributes and memorials to friends and
              fellow-artists falling by the wayside, Richard Brautigan most
              poignantly.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rolling Stock</i> itself fell by that wayside
              and folded in 1991, or just didn't come out again. There is a time for
              everything. A couple of years later, for the volume, <i>Way West</i> of 1993, Dorn gathered together stories, essays, and what, rather than
              poems, he now interestingly called &quot;verse accounts.&quot; Herein and
              elsewhere his judgements upon the United States were becoming ever more
              severe and contemptuous, upon the United States as a bastion of myopic,
              self-serving stupidity and upon the United States as simply the turbine
              that drove the material or materialistic world, global capitalism, I
              suppose. &quot;We've simply got too much . . . <i>our habits are showing</i> to all the world, and they're bad habits, and they're gargantuan
              habits. This is what is ordinarily said to be the standard of living.
              It gets to be monstrous.&quot; Or again, &quot;'America' is a smug, hardhearted,
              unforgiving nation of jackals, which forever slaps itself on its back
              over how generous, selfless, and idealistic it is. It is the most
              preposterous propaganda barrage since Goebbels ran an office, in
              bloodier and more interesting times.&quot; Mind you, &quot;forever in America is
              about as long as it takes the sun to go down. Somewhere around three
              minutes.&quot; He affected to regret that there were no barbarians at the
              gates, ready to &quot;waste this decadent power.&quot; But if all that he
              latterly said or thought was a calculated insult to established or
              mainstream America of the political right and centre, he took trouble
              also to offend the intellectually correct left within the universities,
              speaking here in defense of the literary canon and the English language:</font></p>

                plenty of work to be had. </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, offence intended, given, and, one gathers,
              taken, here, there and everywhere. As Tom Raworth observed in his
              obituary for the Independent, &quot;Dorn suffered fools not at all, and
              sloppy thinking not for a moment; a lonely position at the best of
              times, and one that made him almost <i>persona non grata</i> within
              the academic climate of his homeland.&quot; But he enjoyed it, I'm sure. He
              was, to use Middle West vernacular, an ornery cuss.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite that knock at the French there, he
              happily undertook an exchange year, teaching in the South of France at
              Montpellier in 1996. It sparked in him what might seem to be a
              completely new interest and enthusiasm, for the mediaeval Cathars of
              that region, heretical, subversive of papal authority, dangerously
              popular, and at length violently suppressed in the Albigensian crusade.
              Dorn set to work this time on another long poem, which was on every
              page one part verse, one part prose, and one part what I can only call,
              archaicly, telegrammese. It was entitled, after the Languedoc region in
              which Montpellier is situated, <i>Languedoc Variorum: A Defense of Heresy and Heretics</i>. Sections of it appeared in a volume called <i>High West Rendezvous</i>,
              which was published in 1997 by Etruscan Books, who I understand are to
              bring out the whole of it, or all that he wrote of it, sometime this
              year. &quot;A Defense of Heresy and Heretics.&quot; Perhaps not a new interest
              and departure then, just the latest shape of a lifelong project, a
              lifelong mission, the latest manifestation of a lifelong, consistent
              character. For Dorn was of course a born heretic, a devotee of heresy
              and heterodoxy, anarchic, individualistic, nonconforming, in a word,
              going right back to his Middle Western roots, Protestant, a word he
              stood by, cherished, waved proudly. Speaking together over the
              telephone after Donald Davie's death in 1995, I must have sounded
              surprised by the evident extent to which, despite their great
              differences, Dorn identified with Davie. &quot;Well, we're both
              Protestants,&quot; he said, and laughed. And in <i>Languedoc Variorum</i>, that &quot;Defense of Heresy and Heretics,&quot; Davie is saluted as &quot;a truly reconstructed Protestant soldier,&quot; whose late volume, &quot;<i>To Scorch or Freeze</i> is the most economical rebuke this age in moral free-fall is likely to get.&quot; Of course, unlike the devout Davie, Dorn was no <i>Christian</i> Protestant, no Christian at all, hostile to any monotheism, but a
              deep-dyed, original Protestant none the less, in the sense of one
              registering a radical, individual protest against any controlling,
              monolithic centre of power or opinion, whether in the sixteenth century
              called Catholicism or in the twentieth or twenty first State Socialism
              or Liberal Democracy or Political Correctness or New Labour or Market
              Forces or Common Sense or of course established or institutional
              Protestantism. One of his poems, or things, from <i>Abhorrences</i> is
              entitled &quot;The Protestant View:&quot; &quot;that eternal dissent/and the ravages
              of/faction are preferable/to the voluntary/servitude of
              blind/obedience.&quot; But Protestant doesn't sound quite right, does it,
              because of the necessary Christian context; nor Protester, because of
              the mass, communal associations. ProTESTant, it'll have to be,
              protesting ceaselessly and individually in the name of morality,
              intelligence, awareness.</font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May 1997 Dorn was diagnosed as suffering from
              pancreatic cancer and told he could expect only six months to live.
              Treatment, care, will, and fortune stetched that six months to more
              than two and a half years, during which time he continued to work, to
              travel, and to give readings. In his obituary for The Guardian James
              Campbell wrote of how in London in late 1998, &quot;Dorn clearly ill, gave a
              strange, mesmerising performance, which was somewhere between poetry,
              stand-up comedy and personal tragedy.....The overall impression was of
              an almost unbearable sensitivity.&quot; And as recently as last August he
              came again to England, to read in Bristol, in the company of Jeremy
              Prynne, who honoured his friend by agreeing to read in public for the
              first time in more than thirty years. </font></p>
            <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I shall end this memoir with a note that hasn't
              quite been heard yet. It's not his voice, but they're his words, it's
              his song, and it's pure Ed. He was a country boy and a westerner, and
              this is a country and western song, written by him in 1995 and sung by
              his friend, Greg Keeler, with whom he would go on trips, fishing and
              such, up through the vastness of Montana. Montana, last redoubt of all
              kinds of political outlaw of extreme right or anarcho-left, where
              heavily armed survivalists await government agents or apocalypse, and
              where the unibomber was at length tracked down and taken. As the song
              says, &quot;Some of them dead/Called to their last tattoos.&quot; With due
              acknowledgement to Walt Whitman, father of American poetry, &quot;So long,
