            <p align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> had come to <a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/bouldergallery">Boulder</a> from San Francisco in the fall of 1977, not planning to stay. Ed had
              signed a one-year contract as visiting poet at the University of
              Colorado, another in a series of jobs that had made us academic nomads,
              taking us from Lawrence, Kansas to Chicago, from Kent State to
              Riverside and La Jolla, and back a couple of times to Essex, England.
              When the University asked Ed to teach again the next year, we still
              thought it was temporary. Nevertheless, after returning to our North
              Beach apartment (which we'd lent to friends) for a last summer in what
              seemed to be a dying utopia, we packed all our belongings into a U-Haul
              and left San Francisco for good.</font></b>            </p>
          </center>
        </h2>
      </center>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It wasn't until the following year, at the
        beginning of the 80's, that Ed was offered a tenure track position, I
        got a job teaching in Film Studies, and we set about looking for a
        place to rent that didn't require us to move out every summer. It never
        occurred to us to buy a house: we thought owning property was oh, so
        bourgeois; in California we hadn't even had car insurance. The house at
        1035 Mapleton was half of a duplex-one floor with high ceilings and
        wood floors that led to an expansive kitchen and in the back a sagging,
        covered in porch. Because of the steep slope, it seemed to hang in the
        boughs of trees outside the windows, and it became our bedroom. Later,
        with the help of friends, Ed turned the old coal shed out back into a <a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/cabin">writing cabin</a>.
        The only rental on a street full of mansions, the house sat on top of a
        hill and was equidistant between the foothills and the downtown Pearl
        Street Mall. Kidd (10) and Maya (8) only had to walk a block to get to
        school. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our landlord, who lived across the street in a <a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/mansion">mansion</a> that had more tiers and columns than a wedding cake (amazingly, it had
        been ordered from a Sears catalogue; every room had built-in furniture
        made of different exotic wood), said it was a great house for parties.
        He was right. We called it the slave's quarters or the shack, but maybe
        because we were renters or because of its central location-as Ron
        Sukenick said, we had the worst house on the best street in Boulder-we
        would become the hosts of a continual party for the next 13 years. Ed
        could retreat to his cabin when he wanted to work, although it also
        became a spare bedroom for overnight guests, a sacrifice he made only
        for friends he held in high regard. It was the talking, punctuated by
        loud raucous laughter, more than the music that had the kids begging us
        to turn the volume down in the wee hours of the morning. It was at one
        of these sessions around the kitchen table that <i>ROLLING STOCK</i> was born.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ed had always loved print in all its forms.
        Growing up in Villa Grove, Illinois, he set type at the local paper. At
        Black Mountain he ran the printing press. In Pocatello, Idaho, he
        started <i>Wild Dog</i> with his student Drew Wagnon. In San Francisco
        we lived above the Zephyrus Image print shop belonging to Holbrook
        Teter and Michael Myers, masters of the linotype and linocut
        respectively, whom Ed fired up and conspired with in various subversive
        projects, the most ambitious being <i>Bean News</i>, a one-off, very fine and utterly insane newspaper (said to be the one Gunslinger read).</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now in Boulder, Ed wanted to have a &quot;real&quot;
        newspaper--one that came out regularly and had real news in it--in the
        form of letters and essays, and an occasional poem. We'd been talking
        about such a project with Peter Michelson and Sidney Goldfarb, friends
        from the University of Colorado Creative Writing Program. We envisioned
        the publication as a literary newspaper, a modern day version of the
        18th Century <i>Rambler</i>, <i>Spectator</i>, <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Idler</i>.
        We agreed we wanted content. There were plenty of little poetry
        magazines in circulation. We would have our contributors report on what
        was going on in their territory--physical or intellectual--rather than
        send us yet another solipsistic poem. The paper would have a regional
        motif, but our correspondents would cover the world. To be real, the
        local had to be global. We ran through the iconography of the West in
        search of an appropriate title: cowboys and indians, the Gold Rush,
        miners and unions, the railroad.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sidney came up with the name, which we instantly recognized as a stroke of genius. <i>ROLLING STOCK</i> literally means anything that gets transported along the railroad, but it also had these other associations. It played on <i>Rolling Stone</i>,
        which turned out to be a great bonus when we got press cards, as people
        assumed we were from the Big-Time. It could refer to paper stock
        rolling through the massive web press the journal was printed on.
  &quot;Stock&quot; could be taken as stocks and bonds or as cattle. A lot of
        people never did know exactly what the railroad term meant, but even
        that added to the mystique, and the train logo gave it a motif. When Ed
        hit on the motto &quot;If It Moves Print It,&quot; we knew we were off and
        running. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the beginning <i>ROLLING STOCK</i> was a
        collaborative project. We each put some money in and various graduate
        students offered their services: Joe Safdie and Jason Potter typeset
        the copy, and Normandie Ellis taught us how to lay it out on the blue
        line sheets. The first issue came out in June 1981. Although we had all
        agreed to write something for it, only Peter Michelson, a skilled
        practitioner of the essay, met the deadline. His piece, &quot;The Blinding
        Lights of Contrariety: A Dialogue Concerning Ginsburg, Buddhism and
        Reality&quot; took up 10 wide columns. Other long articles included &quot;Crisis
        in The Mexican Countryside&quot; by William Taylor, &quot;Hit Me,&quot; an interview
        with Charlie Di Julio about gambling in Las Vegas, an essay on film by
        Stan Brakhage and a story by Jane Brakhage recounting a murder trial in
        Leadville. This was her first published story--Ed made a point of
        encouraging writers who'd never published before by commissioning and
        printing their work. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of the copy came from Ed's personal
        correspondence. There was a dispatch from Duncan McNaughton in Damascus
        on Mid-East politics; a letter from Lisa Raworth in Brixton about the
        riots there and another from our Guatemalan correspon dent Steve
        Stewart (who wrote anonymously, in fear for his life); a piece by Terry
        Jacobus about the poetry fights in Chicago, a fable about &quot;The Little
        Economy and How it Grew&quot; by Ed Nell, a report about the Moonies in
        Gloucester (also anonymous) by Fred Buck; a kind of Fear and Loathing
        piece from Jim Inskeep in Taos; Tom Clark's first So. Cal report, and
        an update on the ice shelf containing Captain Scott's body from Tom
        Raworth. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/rsbdc">The local papers</a> featured us in <a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/rscolodaily">articles</a> and we were reviewed favorably in the literary press. We sent out about
        200 copies (of a print run of 500) and started a mailing list on file
        cards. Resistant to the idea of being beholden to government grants, we
        managed to pool enough resources to print issue number 2. We acquired
        an art director, Jim Howard, who designed a new banner. Artist, bass
        player and tennis pro Trixie Merkin illustrated many of the pages with
        her collages. And Sidney Goldfarb made his other famous contribution to <i>ROLLING STOCK</i>: a letter to Menachim Begin with the headline
  &quot;Kike to Kike.&quot; In it he railed against Begin for massacring the
        Palestinians, and in mock due respect, conceded that he himself had not
        suffered personally through the Holocaust-his uncle had not been turned
        into a lampshade, for example. For a time we feared for our jobs. When
        a professor reported us to the Anti-Defamation League and threatened a
        lawsuit, we sat low for a while. Then the furor died down, Sidney wrote
        a play set in southern Colorado, became a playwright, and never wrote
        another article for the paper.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With #2 (Feb. '82) we established several themes
        and started a number of regular columns by our correspondents. Dick
        Dillof wrote a story about Laotians eating dogs in Missoula; Lucia
        Berlin contributed a story about telephone operators at an Oakland
        hospital; we interviewed John Echo-Hawk, director of the Native
        American Rights fund (Roger Echo-Hawk would become our correspondent
        for Native American affairs); Terry Jacobus interviewed Al Simmons on
        the Chicago Poetry Punch-ups; we continued our Latin American coverage
        with a journal from Bogot&aacute; I taped Stan Brakhage talking about the
        Telluride film festival and transcribed and edited it into the first of
        a regular series; Jane Brakhage wrote the first of her Lump Gulch
        Tales.

      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Issue #3 (June '82) added China to the mix.
        Peter Michelson and Marilyn Krysl had gone to teach there for 6 months
        and sent us articles, poems and a long interview with Feng Jicai. We
        published a piece by Osvaldo Sabino on Argentina, and a report on the
        excavation of the temple in Mexico City by David Carrasco. Nick
        Sedgwick sent us the first of his golfing columns, which would run in
        every issue. We ran our first obit-on Max Finstein, with a poem by
        Robert Creeley and a remembrance by Luc&iacute;a Berlin. #4 (Feb. '83)
        continued the Chinese coverage with a long article about Misty Poetry
        and poems in translation. We devoted a page in memory of Michael Myers,
        the genius linocut artist we'd lived and worked with in California. We
        also did an interview with Gerry Casales of Devo, a band Ed had
        encouraged when they were his students at Kent State. By this time we
        had started to apply for and receive annual grants from local and state
        arts organizations. Although we never had enough funds t o pay
        ourselves, Ed insisted we offer small stipends to our contributors-to
        encourage and reward good writing. After all, we claimed to be a real
        newspaper. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In #5 (June '83) we ran an interview with a
        Boulder woman Ruth Schrock, whose professor husband disappeared one
        weekend in Mexico. We were the first to cover her nightmare story, and
        although we spelled her name wrong-not the first or last front page
        typo-we got it out there. We also introduced a medical column by Dr.
        Daves, who advised readers to stay away from doctors unless they needed
        their blood pressure checked. We printed microstories by and an
        interview with Chinese minimalist Wang Meng. And we got into trouble
        once more by publishing Tom Clark's &quot;Lemon/Aids awards for Poetry in
        recognition of the current Epidemic of Idiocy on the poetry scene.&quot; Ed
        could never resist an opportunity to expose fuzzy thinking and
        undermine the status quo, but in this case one could argue that his
        editorial judgment bordered on bad taste. #6 (Oct. '83) featured
        excerpts and cartoons from the socialist newspaper of the 20's, <i>Appeal to Reason</i>,
        from a book by John Graham, an interview with spiritual leader Wallace
        Black Elk, and Stan Brakhage's account of his disastrous attempt to
        show his films to Andrei Tarkovsky in a Telluride hotel room.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite our relative success with getting grants
        locally, we only got one NEA. After that they told us we &quot;were not
        literary enough.&quot; What they meant is that we were too political. About
        the only long poem we published was &quot;The Hurt&quot; by Jim Gustafson.
        Correspondents included Woody Haut on Labor, John Daley on Law, Roger
        Echo-Hawk on Native American Affairs, Nick Sedgwick on Golf, Stan
        Brakhage on Film, Jane Brakhage on Lump Gulch, Dick Dillof in Montana,
        Luc&iacute;a Berlin in California, Tom Raworth, London &amp; Cambridge,
        Fielding Dawson, New York; Jeremy Prynne, English Letters, Marilyn
        Krysl in China, James Inskeep, So. Col, Tom Clark, So Cal., and Robert
        Lewis, Akron &amp; Abroad. Graphics were regularly supplied by Tom
        Clark, John Dunbar and Ann Mikolowski among many others. We had a
        section called Libros for book reviews, and Ed recommended his own
        reading in a column called Salients. He also wrote most of the
        editorials. We encouraged letters from critical or outraged readers,
        and occasionally made up our own to liven things up.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Starting with #7 the paper got trimmed and
        stapled and we had 4-color covers featuring a theme or story. The cover
        story in #7 (May '84) was a series of interviews with Scarlot Harlot,
        Margot St. James and other working girls by Simone Okamura. #8 (Oct.
        '84) focused on Nicaragua, with Margaret Randall interviewing poets and
        Harriet Edelstein on the Sandinista Defense Committees. #9 (March '85)
        featured memorials to Richard Brautigan by Robert Creeley, Brad
        Donovan, Greg Keeler and Anne Waldman. #10 (Oct. '85) was the Fugs
        issue, with lyrics and graphics by Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupderberg. #11
        (March '86), with paintings by Chuck Forsman, ranged the West, from
        Omer Stewart on peyote and Patty Limerick on frontier Chinese, to
        Echo-Hawk on disappeared Native American writers and Ekon-es-kaka on
        the Kickapoo; we also printed my interview with Colorado born singer
        Dean Reed, cold war cowboy and superstar of the Soviet Bloc. Three
        months later his body was found in a lake outside his home in East
        Berlin, and #12 ('86) featured him on the cover, with my article
        investigating his mysterious death. (The story of this &quot;famous unknown
        American&quot; so intrigued me I went on to write a full-scale biography,
        but so far publishers have deemed it not commercial enough). This issue
        also had Allen Ginsberg arguing with Sandinista poets about their
        politics. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">#13 (May '97) carried Ed's coverage of the Elko
        Cowboy Festival and various opposing views on the Hopi/Navajo dispute.
        In #14 (Oct '87) Ward Churchill and Jim Vanderwall described the FBI's
        role on Pine Ridge reservation, and Tom Pickard explained how Thatcher
        closed down the shipbuilding industry in the north of England. The last
        issues were double-with 48 pages. There's so much in every issue and so
        many names I haven't mentioned, I won't list any more contents, but
        just identify them. #15/16 (Jan '89) Russia; #17/18 (April &lsquo;90) Latin
        America; #19/20 (May '91) Far North. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>ROLLING STOCK</i> was a collaborative effort
        involving our correspondents, artists, writers, art director, student
        interns, volunteers--too many to mention by name--but it remained a
        cottage industry endeavor with me at its shaky helm. By now we had
        about 1000 subscribers, several distributors, and another list of
        independent bookstores. Peter helped push the engine along from issue
        to issue-a constant and necessary driving force. As we worked through
        the night Ed provided heads and subheads, brought food, drink, and
        anything else we needed to get the thing done. The final marathon was
        the mailing party, to which we invited friends of the magazine to help
        sort, label and rubber stamp. By the end of the decade we'd had enough.
        Production, promotion, distribution, grant writing-never enough funds
        to pay ourselves-and meanwhile, with teaching responsibilities, little
        time to write. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the decade we brought out <i>ROLLING STOCK</i>, Ed was writing <i>Abhorrences: A Chronicle of the 80's</i>. <i>ROLLING STOCK</i> and <i>Abhorrences</i> were two sides of the same coin--one expansive and collaborative, the
        other incisive and singular. The poems are short essays on the state of
        the world--pithy, direct distillations. <i>Abhorrences</i> was
        published in1990 by Black Sparrow Press and printed by Graham
        Macintosh, whom he considered, as he wrote in pencil on the dedication
        page of the copy he gave me, &quot;not just one of the great printers of the
        world but also a great optical manager of the language.&quot; For Ed,
        publishing was much more than selling books or seeing his own work in
        print. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>ROLLING STOCK</i> rolled to a stop in 1991,
        but it never really died, just like people don't suddenly stop
        existing. They're not around in person anymore but they're still with
        us. Something of <i>ROLLING STOCK</i> lived on in the m agazine I published during the 90's, <i>Sniper Logic</i>,
        funded by the Creative Writing Program and edited by graduate students.
        Its 8&quot; x 7&quot; format still allowed for columns and graphics on a small
        scale. Ed took a great interest in it, helped solicit work and sent
        copies out to his own mailing list. By now we were living in
        Denver-only after our kids left home did we finally understand that
        buying a house made more sense than renting one. We looked into buying
        1035 Mapleton, but it was way beyond us. Anyway, it was time to move
        out, and as Ed liked to say as we commuted home from the job, it was
        always a pleasure to see Boulder disappear in the rear view mirror. The
        90's were a new era.</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Sniper Logic</i> crashed after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade towers, but just this spring I inaugurated a new publication, <i>Square One</i>,
