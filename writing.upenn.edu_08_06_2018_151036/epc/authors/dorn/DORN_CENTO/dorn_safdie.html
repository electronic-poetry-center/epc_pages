        </blockquote>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2first"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the introduction to <i>Internal Resistances</i>,
                  a book of essays on the poetry of Ed Dorn published in 1985, Donald
                  Wesling writes about Ed's first class at UC San Diego in La Jolla in
                  the spring of 1976, when, &quot;after a prolonged silence,&quot; he dramatically
                  unrolled a map (&quot;There is your domain&quot;) of the railroads stretching
                  across the Western United States. I had a similar experience of Ed's
                  teaching style at the University of Colorado some 18 months later. He
                  had been hired to teach in the creative writing program that had
                  started up the previous year; the teaching assistants, of whom I was
                  one, were directed to attend once-a-week lectures by the permanent
                  faculty to the undergraduates, who were then broken up into smaller
          sections taught by us.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These lectures were given in a cavernous lecture
                  hall with green walls, mostly used for chemistry classes; I remember a
                  row of Bunsen burners arrayed across a long slab of formica. One
                  afternoon early in the semester, Dorn strode in, wearing cowboy boots
                  and a vest, and started taking out a series of books from a leather
                  bag. After three or four had emerged, he squinted balefully out at the
                  assembled students, took out a match, struck it against the edge of the
                  formica slab, lit his cigarette, and took a deep drag, not saying a
                  word for about five minutes &ndash; the ritual was impeccable. Finally, he
                  said &quot;The subject of these lectures is obviously what I've been
                  reading&quot; . . . and started talking about Cioran's philosophy, Samuel
          Johnson's <i>Life of Richard Savage</i> and W.E. Woodward's <i>Meet General Grant</i>, weaving them together in a brilliant para-logical narrative the likes of which I haven't come close to hearing since.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd been lucky enough to have experienced some
                  great teachers in my university experience, but this was something else
                  again; I was 24 years old, and I was hooked. Ed's work and presence
                  were my most important instruction in poetry, and they still inform
          almost everything I write.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lots of critical essays have been written about his work &ndash; the aforementioned <i>Internal Resistances</i> has some good ones in it, and Tom Clark's recent biography <i>A World of Difference</i> provocatively interweaves the facts of Ed's life with reflections on
                  his writing and the peculiar indeterminacy of his authorial persona &ndash;
          but here I'd like to informally remember a little bit of what it was
          like being, first, a student of Ed's, and then a friend and occasional
          correspondent until the pancreatic cancer (what he would call &quot;the
          alien&quot; in <i>Chemo S&aacute;be</i>, the record of those last years) finally took over in December of 1999.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I saved myself by . . . establishing a ritual
                  of my own person&quot; he wrote in &quot;Driving Across the Plains,&quot; and I don't
                  think it's possible to explain how special it was being around him
                  without talking about his presence, always a little larger than life. A
                  few years after I'd left Boulder for San Francisco, I organized a
                  benefit reading for <i>Zephyr</i>, the magazine I was editing at the
                  time, to coincide with a visit from Ed and his wife Jenny, and called
                  all the writers I knew. Richard Grossinger, writer and publisher of
                  North Atlantic Press, said he had just seen a Clint Eastwood movie that
                  reminded him of Ed, and if you can picture <i>Pale Rider</i> or that first scene of <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i>,
                  that wariness and rock-hard cragginess . . . that was definitely part
                  of the image. He both was and wasn't Slinger, the demi-god of his most
                  famous work -- certainly those of us who were privileged to have kept
                  company with him often assumed those adventures were continuing -- but
                  I think people who didn't know him well assumed that a certain
                  splenetic sarcasm was all there was. That's too bad, as he was one of
          the most generous people I've ever known.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But he did have a fiery temper. Perhaps our most
                  unusual contact was in 1992, when he and Jenny drove from Southern
                  France (where the <i>Languedoc Variorum</i>, originally called <i>Languedoc Around the Clock</i>,
                  had its origins in the early 90s) to Olomouc, a small town in the Czech
                  Republic where my wife and I were teaching as Peace Corps volunteers,
                  and where I had arranged for him to give a talk and a reading. I'd
                  mailed what I thought were fairly accurate maps, but apparently had
                  left out a crucial segment &ndash; anyway, they got lost, and when they
                  finally arrived, an hour or so late, it didn't seem as if the vodka I'd
          made sure to chill in our freezer would be enough to calm him.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It reminded me of a time back in Boulder when he
                  and Jenny needed a place to stay for a few nights before the fall
                  semester of 1978 began. They had been in San Francisco over the summer,
                  winding up their affairs in North Beach, and were traveling with their
                  kids and most of their possessions.* I was sharing a house near the
                  university at the time with a young single mother, and gladly gave up
                  my room and slept on the deck outside. I didn't know, however, that my
                  roommate had managed to offend Ed with a stray remark during the
                  evening, and I woke up at about 6:00 in the morning to the whole family
                  tramping out to a motel &ndash; &quot;Tell your roommate she won't have to bother
                  with us anymore,&quot; he growled. I was mortified, but visited him in their
                  motel room a day later, and all was forgiven . . . the remark, whatever
          it had been, forgotten.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He calmed down after the long drive to Olomouc
                  as well -- &quot;I never thought I'd get this far East,&quot; he said, and
                  learning they would stay in a guest house that Mozart had once stayed
                  in didn't hurt. We had a great dinner at a Chinese restaurant, paid for
                  by a visiting law professor from Georgetown we were sure was a member
                  of the CIA. (He kept on getting Ed's name confused with Bernadine
                  Dohrn's). The next morning, Ed gave a well-attended talk about Black
                  Mountain at Palacky University, and that afternoon, a reading, complete
                  with Czech translator. <a href="http://centomag.org/dorn/image/prague"><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/dorn/DORN_CENTO/safdie_files/85thumb1.jpeg" alt="Ed Dorn and Joe Safdie in Prague, Spring, 1992" style="border: 2px solid black;" align="left" height="103" width="150" /></a>I
                  remember that the poems he was going to read had to be arranged in
                  advance with the rector of the university, who wanted him to read
                  pieces that had already been translated into Czech from <i>Hands Up</i> and <i>Geography</i> &ndash; personal lyrics like &quot;Are They Dancing&quot; and others written to Helene,
                  with which Ed felt quite uncomfortable and read awkwardly. The next
                  day, we drove to Prague to pick up his check from the U.S. embassy, a
                  photo of George Bush the Elder gazing down at us. It was the summer of
                  1992, and the first tales of Bill Clinton's infidelities were in the
                  news, this time with Jennifer Flowers. &quot;He fucked her,&quot; he said at our
          table in the Grand Hotel on Wenceslas Square, &quot;but he didn't come.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was constitutionally unable to support anyone
                  in power; although he once allowed as how he had voted for Jimmy
                  Carter, his scorn at what he felt was the amateurish nature of that
                  administration in the late 1970s was relentless. As Wesling said about
                  him, &quot;Dorn is not a poet of causes. In fact, he is suspicious of anyone
                  who <i>favors</i> anything.&quot; I laughed when Clark revealed one of Ed's
                  earliest intellectual influences, a Methodist preacher who said &quot;It's
                  not okay, and it's not going to be okay.&quot; When I saw him in Seattle in
                  1994, he and Jenny were engaged in a project called &quot;Negativity,&quot;
          collecting notes about public signage that expressed hostile
          sentiments. One favorite was &quot;The King is rolling in his grave&quot; (a
                  reference to the ill-fated marriage of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie
          Presley).</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seemed at times that he purposely picked on
                  popular received ideas, if only to pierce any of them that had been
                  accepted lazily, without a thorough examination &ndash; the word &quot;gadfly&quot;
          comes to mind. Once, when we were walking quickly across the CU campus
          (he always moved quickly), a squirrel was attracting some attention
          from the coeds. &quot;Everybody has these Walt Disney feelings about them,&quot;
          he snarled &ndash; &quot;they're just bushy-tailed rats.&quot; I also remember, in the
                  midst of a popular boycott of the Coors brewery, Ed going up to the
                  bartender at the Boulderado Hotel and loudly demanding a Coors. As
                  Anselm Hollo said, in Clark's biography, &quot;Almost any take endorsed by
                  the U.S. media, and perhaps especially by the &lsquo;liberal' wing of same,
                  was instantly suspect, and Ed's m.o. was to assume the diametrically
                  opposed position.&quot; An e-mail correspondent a few years ago sniffed
                  disapprovingly about his references to the &quot;jackbooted purveyors of
                  multiculturalism,&quot; and his famous air bag poem &ndash; one of the first of
                  the short, twisted epigrams that were to make up most of his work in
          the late 70s and 80s &ndash; was in part a diatribe against Ralph Nader.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But as a student, I took his rants as an
                  opportunity to sharpen my attention to what he thought were the
                  pernicious forces forever threatening us, &quot;conning the present to
                  hustle the futcha / By a simple elimination of the datadata&quot; (&quot;The
                  Cycle&quot;) &quot;They ALWAYS want to screw you, Oscar,&quot; he once admonished one
                  of my roommates, who had innocently complained about his utility bill.
                  Things assumed heightened importance whenever he was around, no matter
                  what the subject of conversation was, which made me (and hundreds of
                  others) want to explore and learn a little about what he knew.<br />
          For me, specifically, that was American history &ndash; in my standardized
                  English department education before grad school, I'd thought of the
                  18th century only in terms of Pope and Swift, and (of course?) favored
                  the romantics to come. No, no, no, he insisted -- this was the century
                  of the American revolution; this is where we came from! He got me
                  reading epochal books of American history, W.E. Woodward's <i>Washington: The Image and the Man</i> and <i>Meet General Grant</i>, and Claude Bowers' <i>Jefferson and Hamilton</i>,
                  which were much more inspiring than the aesthetic theories and
                  confessional poems of the late 70s, and gave me a lifelong preference
                  for poetry that incorporated and explored historical fact rather than
                  the intricacies of its own syntax. I didn't get to all of Olson's
                  recommendations in the famous &quot;Bibliography on America,&quot; but I found
                  quite a few -- Walter Prescott Webb's <i>The Great Plains</i>, Kathleen Coman's <i>Economic Beginnings of the Far West</i>,
                  Carl Sauer -- all of which rescued me from any possibility of repeating
                  the mainstream lyric effusions then in vogue. (As I went to the
          &quot;Bibliograhy&quot; to remember the spelling of Ms. Coman's name, I found
                  Olson's remark that &quot;our own &lsquo;life' is too serious a concern for us to
                  be parlayed forward by literary antecedence. In other words, &lsquo;culture,'
          no matter how great&quot; &ndash; which seems relevant.)</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But this was a creative writing program, after
                  all, and eventually a few of us, who felt we had progressed &quot;beyond&quot;
          the regular workshops, got a chance to take an advanced class with him.
          The required reading was a letter from Tom Raworth containing an acidic
          review about a European poetry festival (it might have been Spoleto) at
          which many American friends had read, Ed Sanders' <i>Investigative Poetry</i> (which had started as a Naropa class project investigating the infamous
                  Trungpa Rinpoche-W. S. Merwin dispute at a Buddhist retreat and set off
          &quot;The Great Naropa Poetry Wars&quot;; see Tom Clark's book of that title),
                  and another letter from Jeremy Prynne about Sanders' essay, to which he
          was hardly sympathetic -- that one started &quot;But Edward -- . . .&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Think about that for a minute &ndash; a famous poet
                  letting graduate writing students read his own personal correspondence,
                  in order to talk about the issues involved. Writing programs may be
                  problematic (I agree with a lot of the criticism I've read), but if
                  examples of such generosity are on the curriculum, one would be
          small-minded indeed to criticize them. </font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The classes were held around his dinner table,
                  scene of many raucous gatherings (&quot;where one place / is the center of
                  this terrific actualism&quot; as Book III of <i>Slinger</i> had it), but
                  the conversation was serious &ndash; he wanted us to fully consider Prynne's
                  objections before we too rapidly signed on to a trendy new &quot;movement,&quot;
          even one (or especially one) with which he was sympathetic; he wanted
          us to consider everything that poetry could possibly do and be, and
          then find our own way.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing that established writers can do for
                  novices in such situations is simply to recognize them. I still
                  remember Ed saying &quot;That's really masterful compression&quot; after he'd
                  read a short poem I'd written &quot;about&quot; Alexander Hamilton's plan to
                  revamp the currency in the 1790s &ndash; simple encouragement that allowed
                  me, simply, to go on with what I'd been doing. He felt, I think, that
                  serious practitioners need only tell the truth &ndash; and that any device
                  that would lead to the expression of that truth should be exploited --
                  including historical documentation of course, but also jokes, bad puns,
                  sarcasm, irony and &quot;samplings&quot; of other poems! If you weren't somehow
                  telling the truth in your poems, though, there was nothing that he, or
                  anyone, could do for you. (One early criticism came when I showed him a
                  sequence of poems I'd inscribed &quot;For E. M. Cioran&quot; &ndash; &quot;You can't say
          that,&quot; he said, disgusted; &quot;you don't know him.&quot;)</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On March 25, 2000, I helped organize a memorial
                  reading for Ed in Seattle &ndash; many writers came from various far-flung
                  regions to participate. English poet Tom Raworth flew in that morning
                  from Albany, NY; John Daley, who'd met Ed in Buffalo in the 1970s and
                  became a lifelong friend, took a few days off from his criminal defense
                  work in Los Angeles; Charles Potts, author and editor of <i>The Temple</i> and a student of Ed's in Pocatello in the early 1960s, drove in from
                  Walla Walla, etc. I've been listening to the audio cassette of that
                  reading -- readings of and in response to Ed's writing -- while I
                  finish these recollections, and I'm struck, as I have been so often,
                  with that curious combination of fierce morality and side-splitting
                  humor that he practiced so well. As he said, in the late reading tour
                  of Eastern Washington that Potts arranged, &quot;My problem is how to make
          pain funny.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That was something he managed to pull off pretty well in his last book of poems, <i>Chemo S&aacute;be</i>, and in this wonderful quote from a late letter to Clark:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify" class="centoprose"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But now I'm leveling off again and feel much better. I've stopped taking that fucking Zoloft for starters, and feel a <i>lot</i> better already. That has to be something invented by some New Age
                    Torquemada, mindless nasty stuff. It is said, and I believe it, that
                    the whole English dept. at CU is &quot;on&quot; it, and that theorists in general
                    everywhere can't function without it. No wonder they detest the past in
            which it didn't exist. (September 30, 1998)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The seriousness was always there, from &quot;The Rick
                  of Green Wood&quot; on, but it took a while to register the humor, encased,
                  as it so often was, in bitterness. Another thing about Ed that Raworth
                  mentioned at the memorial was that he knew about work; he knew what it
                  meant to be poor and live on food stamps (see Clark's bio, and his own
                  semi-autobiographical <i>By The Sound</i>, for vivid descriptions of
                  that poverty), and he never failed to indict the people responsible for
                  the maintenance of that situation. Yet the humor made the social
                  commentary even more pointed -- &quot;1 billion Chinese are telling me / the
                  gang of 4 are wrong? / Doesn't this seem out of proportion?&quot; he asked
                  in <i>Yellow Lola</i>, a book of &quot;offshoots&quot; from <i>Hello, La Jolla</i>. (I'm not sure if I've ever seen any comment that <i>Yellow Lola</i> is an approximation of a Japanese person trying to pronounce the name
                  of the earlier book; Ed was hysterically politically incorrect before
          such things were even possible.)</font></p>
        <p align="justify" class="centoprose2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And finally, that's what matters most. He was
                  just such a gas to be around. As John Daley said at the memorial
                  reading, &quot;One was never bored around Edward.&quot; Which made it such an
                  honor, in the winter of 1979, when my roommate and I drove down to
                  Santa Fe to, among other things, meet Max Finstein, the eminence grise
                  behind the Taos World Championships of Poetry, to be accompanied by a
                  note that said: &quot;Max &ndash; these are my friends, Stokes and Joe. Show them
                  a good time.<br />

        <p align="justify" class="centoinfo"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* They left me their parakeet to take care of
          while they were gone. One day my roommates let it out of the cage and
          it flew into a nearby tree; I almost had heart failure. I had lost Ed
          Dorn's bird! My life as I knew it was over! We put the cage on top of
          the car hood and whistled, and after a few minutes, the bird,
          amazingly, flew back in. Two days after I proudly returned it to them,
          a cat got in its cage and tore it apart.</font></p>
