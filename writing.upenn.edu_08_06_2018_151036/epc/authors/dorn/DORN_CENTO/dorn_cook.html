            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I<b>n January 2000 I was in hospital in Meschede a
        town in Germany on the Ruhr, about an hour's drive east from Dortmund,
        when I found out about Ed's death. While I was lying there, with
        nothing much to do day in day out, I thought about the time and space
        I'd known Ed at Essex University and I wrote a letter to Herbie
        Butterfield my tutor at Essex and, since then, an old friend. It is an
        edited version of this letter that forms the basis of this recollection.          </b></font></p>

      <p class="centoprose"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was so sad to read of Ed's death in the
        Guardian Weekly. I'd missed James Campbell's obituary when I first
        received the paper before Christmas and only read it glancing through
        the newspaper on my return from the Millenium celebrations in London. A
        very good obituary I thought. A column to the side of a picture of and
        a four column piece on Joseph Heller--ah well, what the hell.</font></b></p>
      <p class="centoprose"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I liked Ed a lot. It was hard not to. Chatting in
        the bar about Richard Brautigan and Ed saying women taking the pill
        made men lose their mind. One day me and Kim, so this was later,
        invited him up to one of the rooms in the University towers for a
        smoke. He came with Jenny and along with smoking the joints we all had
        some fruit cake, except Ed I think. We had a good time talking with Ed
        making the jokes. On one occasion I visited their house out in the
        styx, I can't remember where, a few miles away from Colchester. We
        drove up in his car and he talked about the good looking girls in
        Colchester. When he showed me round the house he said the fire was one
        of the gods he had to tend to, and he said to Jenny that I'd noticed
        how early the spring was, the buds on the trees appearing in February,
        maybe '69 or '70, can't remember exactly which year. Then one weekend
        all of us, Kim and me, Ed and Jenny went up to Balcombe, near
        Southwold, to stay with Mike Lofthouse in his big old mansion, on the
        side of the marshes. It was a grand old place I thought they may like
        to see. I remember when we decided to play Mahjong, Ed said he didn't
        play games. Jenny played and Ed sat there in a big old armchair reading
        one of Simon's books.</font></b></p>
      <p class="centoprose"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another time me and Johnny Etheridge and some
        other student who played the zither, whose name I can't remember, were
        playing as a trio at Norwich University--me on bongos, Johnny on
        guitar. Jenny and Ed walked around the town with us. Ed was carrying
        the baby (Kidd?) who was crying. Ed said to me, &quot;Play those damn
        things, will ya.&quot;</font></b></p>
      <p class="centoprose"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before the reunion in '90, I'd only heard Ed read
        once. It was a fairly small gathering-twenty or so people in an
        upstairs room in the Literature Department. He read and postured, his
        body language clinching the satire as much as the words. I guess this
        was from a part of &quot;Gunslinger&quot; he'd been writing. I didn't hear him at
        any of the great readings in the Newcastle Tower.</font></b></p>

      <p class="centoprose"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later in 1971, before our finals, Kim and I lived
        in the literature department building--I think it was for a few weeks,
        maybe a month or so. We used to kip on the floor. Ed had his office
        there, a few books on shelves, a table, whatever, some chairs. And we
        used to sleep there at night, pack up our stuff into suitcases in the
        morning and get outta there before anyone arrived. On telling Ed about
        this he said &quot;I thought it looked like the waiting room of a station in
        there,&quot; but he never did anything to get us chucked out. Years later
        when I was moving from Manchester to Iver I found a book of his in
        amongst mine, Amiri Baraka's (then Leroi Jones) <i>Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note</i>--with,
        in handwriting, &quot;To Ed from Leroi&quot; on the title page. Eventually in the
        mid-nineties ('95 was it?) I sent it to him. He and Jenny had moved to
        Denver and he wrote a postcard thanking me for the &quot;blast from the
        past.&quot;</font></b></p>
      <p class="centoprose"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was a truly, very, very bright star. I guess his light will remain for years.</font></b></p>
