<FONT SIZE=4>Can the conquest/invasion of America/Turtle Island
be seen/read/heard from both sides? We might at least retell/redescribe
it, and with a greater multiplicity of voices and a better chance
at avoiding the twin traps of metaphysics (somehow it was all
meant to happen) and of self-congratulation (civilization [read
European (read the author)]). And we might even catch some conquerors/invaders
using the vocabulary and even poetics and rhetoric of Americans/Turtle
Islanders. And reopen the question of (Saints preserve us!) idolatry.
<p>
We will read Tzvetan Todorov's <I>Conquest of the Americas,</I>
where the conquest is rewritten as a contest between sign-systems,
and William Prescott's <I>Conquest of Mexico </I>(ignored by Todorov,
who went back to the &quot;original&quot; sources), and their
sources, including the letters of Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s
and the book by his secretary, Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo,
<I>A True History of the Conquest of New Spain.</I> But we will
also read sources Todorov and others have used in support of arguments
more than they have found arguments in them, including the encyclopedia
of Aztec culture compiled by Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, <I>A
General History of the Things of New Spain </I>(the Florentine
Codex), written by native speakers of Nahuatl (Aztec) but in the
roman alphabet, with a section on the Spanish invasion. Sahag&uacute;n
also collected the text of a 1524 debate between twelve Franciscans
(read the Twelve Apostles) and twelve Aztec priests (read Satanists).
<p>
The story of the invasion of Yucat&aacute;n and Guatemala (both
Mayan) is another matter altogether (and the principal and perhaps
most embarrassing subtext in books of Todorov and others). Here
we will read Diego de Landa's <I>Account of the Matters of Yucat&aacute;n,</I>
together with alphabetically written texts that were created by
Mayans without Spanish supervision, including the Popol Vuh (Council
Book), also called <I>Account of Our Darkness and the Way to See
the Dawn of Life, and Book of the Chilam Balam</I> (Jaguar Priest)
<I>of Chumayel. </I>Then we'll have a look at recent hieroglyphic
decipherment (which Todorov has all wrong) and the intellectual
consequences of the fact that New World WRITING and New World
HISTORY (even in the strictest senses of those terms) now go back
1,000 years into what Europeans have been counting as the prehistory
of preliterates. Not to mention the fact that Mayan script (even
though it comes from the wrong side of the Atlantic) is a grammatologist's
dream.</FONT>
