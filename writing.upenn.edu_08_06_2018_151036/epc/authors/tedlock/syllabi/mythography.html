<FONT SIZE=4>Mythography is the process by which myths (stories)
become graphed (textualized). We will explore this process in
its full range, from ancient writing systems to the tape-recorder,
comparing the works of such mythographers as playwrights, poets,
novelists, and compilers of sacred books, on the one hand, and
those of folklorists, linguists, and ethnographers, on the other.
Our attention will be centered on the telling of stories rather
than the singing of epics; storytelling is older than the epic
and has a far wider distribution among the cultures of the world.
In the folktale (and not in the epic) may be found the oral analog
(and source) of the multivocal discourse of the novel, a fact
which is missed even by Bakhtin. The texture and tenor of oral
narration reflects the age, sex, social status, emotional state,
personality, and even the speech defects of quoted characters;
the quoted voices seep over into third-person narration, creating
what Bakhtin calls double voicing.

There will be exercizes in the scripting of sound recordings.
Term papers may be based either on sound recordings or on narratives
that have already been textualized by means of writing. Each student
will do a class presentation. Readings will include M. M. Bakhtin,
