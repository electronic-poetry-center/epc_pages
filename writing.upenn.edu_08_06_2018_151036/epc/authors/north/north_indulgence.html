    <td valign="top" width="68%"><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Years ago, I came up with the idea of writing  something on &ldquo;critical
              fallacies,&rdquo; all the wrong-headed ways critics (reviewers, academics,
              etc.) approach poetry. I only got as far as making lists of suggestive
              titles. For one thing, Theory had already reared its head and, in  addition
              to scanting poetry, was busy diverting attention from what I.A.
              Richards termed practical criticism. For another, I was more interested
              in writing poems. I almost included a Critical Fallacies Lineup
      in my second set of <em>Lineups </em>(1987), but it didn&rsquo;t make the final cut. </font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently I came across an old notebook list that  has, among a lot
        of others, The Conceptual Fallacy, The Manifest(o) Fallacy, The
        Development Fallacy, Poetics Justice, The Attention Principle (a few &quot;principles&rdquo; found their way in: actually this one got mentioned in
        one of the first prose pieces I ever wrote&mdash;on Harold Bloom misprizing
        John Ashbery), The Da Capo or Sisyphus Principle (after
        Santayana),The Droll/Jolly/Temperate Principle (after Frank O&rsquo;Hara),
        The Exploration/Scientist Fallacy, The Humility Principle, The
        Designated Hitter (or Managed Care) Fallacy, The Faberg&eacute; Fallacy,
        The Indulgence Principle,&nbsp; The  Richard Tuttle Principle, The Principle
        of Grudging Admiration, The Importance of Being Earnest. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I still find the titles and implicit issues, at  least as I perceive them,
        provocative. One that seems to me basic is the Indulgence Principle,
        which takes its cue from Pound&rsquo;s observation that &ldquo;No man
        writes very much poetry that &lsquo;matters.&rsquo;&rdquo; Pound doesn&rsquo;t name
        names, but certain poets rocket to mind, for example Wordsworth,
        whose handful of great poems shine out against pages upon pages
        of dull verse, or, even more obviously, Thomas Hardy. Even a poet as
        self-conscious as Elizabeth Bishop has slight or merely well-crafted
        poems that are not the reasons her poetry will endure. It&rsquo;s difficult
        to think of anyone short of Sappho who isn&rsquo;t remembered for that
        fragment that represents his/her finest, the rest being background:
        failed experiments, partial successes, unnecessary repetitions, wrong
        turns, unwitting self-parody: together, the production of an ongoing
        writing life that proceeds with no advance assurances regarding
        which efforts will wind up at the top, at the bottom, or in the middle
        when that writing life is eventually summed up. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coleridge, in his <em>Biographia Literaria, </em>maintains that &ldquo;our genuine
        admiration of a great poet is a continuous undercurrent of feeling; it
        is everywhere present, but seldom anywhere as a separate excitement.&rdquo;
        Whether this lets Wordsworth, for one, off the hook or not, it
        does provide ample room for mediocrity and worse. What
        Coleridge was, of necessity, less aware of than we are is the extent to
        which poems, together with all the poet&rsquo;s operations and decisions
        concerning them, have unconscious roots (apart from opium
        dreams).A poet&rsquo;s attachment to what he/she writes, including judgments
        about whether to finish a poem, publish it, collect it, etc., is
        inevitably shrouded in mystery, at least to some degree. However
        self-conscious, the practitioner side can&rsquo;t be trusted; it has too much
        unconscious investment in what it produces. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This unconscious factor seems to me a plausible if  not entirely
        satisfying answer to the question, How could someone who wrote
          <em>that </em>have written <em>this</em>? Pound goes on to say <em>(A Retrospect) </em>that when
        the poet isn&rsquo;t producing &ldquo;this highest thing, this saying the thing
        once for all and perfectly...he had much better be making the sorts
        of experiment which may be of use to him in his later work, or to
        his successors.&rdquo; We might say, all well and good if the poet, man or
        woman, knows when this highest thing is occurring. Experience
        says otherwise. Allen Ginsberg, asked in an interview how much of
        his daily note-taking made its way into print, responded, &ldquo;Oh, one
        percent.&rdquo; From my own experience that&rsquo;s not so surprising; yet neither
        is a one percent solution sufficient to ward off the mediocre.
        There is a reason poets have been visited (or left to palely loiter) by
        the Muse, and why prayer, for a poet, is appropriate both at the
        beginning and at the end of a poem. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not that the experimenting isn&rsquo;t vital. Experience  says, at least
        my experience both reading and writing, that poets <em>need </em>to write
        badly, as well as middlingly and well, in order to produce the &ldquo;highest
        thing&rdquo;&mdash;if indeed they are capable of it at all. A part of the writing
        life, apart from experiment, would seem to be getting lower
        things out of the system. Another part is ongoing production
        involving, at its very core, trial and error. Still another involves  discovery,
        even if what is discovered frequently finds its appropriate
        setting only later on, and in many cases can&rsquo;t be acknowledged as a
        discovery until then. Poets do learn from their mistakes just as all
        human beings do; they also continue to make them&mdash;and occasionally
        to avoid them. One of my favorite contemporary poets once
        related the following anecdote. After writing at fever pitch one
        evening he felt, quite simply, that he had produced his best poem
        ever; he had finally <em>done it. </em>The following morning he threw it in
        the basket.
      </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is one side of the Indulgence Principle:  indulging poets the
        bulk of their (inferior) work in order to have their very best. (Of
        course, as Eliot would add, only those poets who have a very best
        deserve indulging.) As such, the principle is an appreciative one,
        generous without being mindless. Rather than prescribe or exclude,
        it displays gratitude that certain poems have coalesced out of the
        welter of language and experience with the power to interest or
        move us in ways almost no other experience seems capable of.
      </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other side of the Indulgence Principle is  equally important,
        though less often acknowledged either by critics or by poets themselves.
        Equally appreciative and generous, this side grants a poet the
        right not to please a reader in every respect: it recognizes that the
&ldquo;highest thing&rdquo; is not only rare but inextricable from all the rest. We
are used to accepting a writer&rsquo;s or artist&rsquo;s subject matter as given.
Accepting certain qualities of style as &ldquo;givens&rdquo; is frequently harder.
        There are, long out of the woodwork by now, many who are put off
        by John Ashbery&rsquo;s ironic self-indulgence to the degree that they
        cannot see his originality and importance&mdash;indeed, that he is probably
        the most important poet in English in the second half of the
        century. Others can&rsquo;t read Faulkner or Henry James and are similarly
        barred from those writers&rsquo; brilliances. Among modern poets,
        Marianne Moore is finical, Auden cerebral (or superficial); Hart
        Crane emits alcohol fumes; William Carlos Williams has &ldquo;no ideas&rdquo;;
        Laura Riding is &ldquo;claustrophobic,&rdquo; Bishop control personified; Frank
        O&rsquo;Hara (and James Schuyler and David Schubert and John Wheelwright)
        has a precious streak; Kenneth Koch relies on formulas;
        Barbara Guest is airy; Robert Creeley is narrowly focused. Among
        poets of my own generation, friends included, everyone who comes
        to mind could be said to be this or that, or too this or too that, self-indulgent,
        self-involved, narrow in range, cerebral, intent on a persona,
        intent on getting a laugh, determinedly &ldquo;unserious,&rdquo; eclectic,
        prosy; and on and on. And yet I have named, and left unnamed, the
        contemporary poets who matter the most to me. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What the Indulgence Principle represents is a  willingness to take
        poems on their own terms, insofar as that is humanly possible. It
        encourages reviewers and critics (and teachers of poetry, who present
        poetry to readers in the only place many of them will ever
        encounter it) to display the reasons why persons not obliged to read
        poems find some of them such stunning human achievements. In
        granting poets their blind spots, stylistic tics, excesses, and the  like, it
        doesn&rsquo;t cede the right to find fault, or to dismiss outright the work
        of those who are merely mediocre or merely imitators. But the
        judgments made in its name are premised upon appreciation rather
        than grounds for exclusion. The other approach&mdash;I should say
        approaches&mdash;diminish our artistic lives and probably our lives in
        general, and the Indulgence Principle, if it had the power, would
      disbar those who fail to take note.</font></p>
