    <p align="Justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it does a disservice to discuss  North in comparative terms, even when it seems apt.&nbsp; North&rsquo;s sensitivity stands alone among the contemporary American  &ldquo;big city&rdquo; poets&hellip;
      
      </font>
    <p align="Justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North is more than capable of setting up a field upon  which to work, to establish a certain language and elements of meaning, and  then to change the field or destroy it, ending a poem in the middle of what  most poets are used to calling a single idea.&nbsp;  The idea to North does not matter; what matters are the associative  patterns and words that bring across the suggestion of a tone or mood, the  establishment of some arcane and unusual circumstance that he sees not only as  the poet&rsquo;s right but also as his responsibility, for it is exactly these types  of poems that were not allowed in previous centuries or even decades.&nbsp; he has eliminated a good deal of what he  sees as the dross in poetry, and where he does allow it to dangle are simply  reminders of the ways in which we have all been held slave to poetic  convention.</font>
    <p align="Justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few poets are trying as many  new things as Charles North is.&nbsp; Poetry  today is largely narrative and confessional.&nbsp;  North has little interest in these types of poems, except to make fun of  them, as he does in the first poem in this book.&nbsp; Perhaps A. R. Ammons, and maybe Michael McClure, are trying  poetries as radical, but all three of these writers have been doing so for a  long time.&nbsp; Many poets respect what  North is doing, but the big prizes and fellowships have avoided him, and  reading this book one can see why.&nbsp; This  is not the material of the American Poetry Series.&nbsp; These poems would sooner be the fragments of the poems in those  types of books.&nbsp; Sometimes the fragment  should <em>be</em> the poem,&nbsp; and we need poets like Charles North to  remind us of that.&nbsp; This generation of  poets doesn&rsquo;t have a Pound or Stevens or Williams to remind us of  anything.&nbsp; But I suspect in their heart  of hearts, as the three poets at the top reveal, the writing of poetry is much  more mysterious than most of us think (at least those of us who have been exposed  to narrative poetry and little else, much less the difficulties in almost every  poem by Charles North). </font></p>
