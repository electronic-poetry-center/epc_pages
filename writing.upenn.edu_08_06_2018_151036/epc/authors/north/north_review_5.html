                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of  the earliest essays in this collection, dated 1976, Charles North notes, &ldquo;It  seems to be the rule, of late, that interesting poets shy away from the  business of literary criticism.&rdquo;&nbsp; North  never did enter the business.&nbsp; Most of  these pieces are occasional and were obviously done for love, not money.&nbsp; But strung together (for the most part,  arranged chronologically) in this book, his occasional essays amount to the  best literary criticism yet written about the New York school, a tag (North  explains) &ldquo;which everyone associated with tries to snip off (with only moderate  success and properly so).&rdquo;&nbsp; As one of  those associates, North&rsquo;s discomfort shows in his juggling the term with  alternatives such as &ldquo;New York poetry scene,&rdquo; &ldquo;St. Mark&rsquo;s,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Poetry Project,&rdquo;  and even &ldquo;New York Schools.&rdquo; Fortunately, we needn&rsquo;t rely on the tag to know  who North is talking about. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the heart  of this book are four essays about James Schuyler, whose poem provides the  book&rsquo;s title and who, throughout the volume, serves as North&rsquo;s measure for what  poets might aspire to.&nbsp; It is while  talking about Schuyler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Light from Canada&rdquo; that North says, &ldquo;I could, I  think, maintain that all exciting poetry has something of this surprise  element, this apparently magical leaping from order to a higher disorder  because born somehow out of nothing that could have been foreseen.&rdquo;
        </font>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether  finding something new to say about a canonical figure such as John Ashbery,  taking a new look at a poet of obscured reputation such as David Schubert, or  appreciating the distinction of a contemporary such as Jim Brodey, North is  always at his strongest when talking about the specific qualities that he  admires in a particular poet or artist.&nbsp;  He pays persistent attention to craft elements such as meter, rhyme,  genre, surface, tone, detail, music, and line breaks.&nbsp; The essay &ldquo;Kenneth Koch in Public&rdquo; is a brilliant exposition of  the democratic poetics that underlie Koch&rsquo;s poems (and pedagogical writings)  and his sympathetic bond with Allen Ginsberg, which I suppose could be traced  to the inspiration both drew from Shelley.&nbsp;  In the same essay North summarizes with characteristic precision the socioliterary  assumption shared by all the poets he writes about, &ldquo;the encouraging notion  that writers are always and properly inspired by other writers; and moreover,  that arbitrary rules (including &lsquo;gimmicks&rsquo;) can stimulate the imagination as  forcibly as more conventional rime, metrical, and structural patterns.&rdquo;
        </font>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also  included in the book are essays on writers Barbara Guest, Elizabeth Bishop,  F.T. Prince, John Hollander, Frances Waldman, Joe Ceravolo, Paul Violi, Tony  Towle, John Godfrey, and Edward Barrett, and artists Richard Tuttle, Edith  Schloss, Aristodemos Kaldis, Fairfield Porter, and Trevor Winkfield.&nbsp; As is clear from that list, the range is  local; North&rsquo;s version of the New York poetry scene doesn&rsquo;t extend to  Brooklyn.&nbsp; But by confining himself to  an intimate landscape, North proves the wisdom of Socratic humility.&nbsp; Though the quality of his attention tests  poems at every syllable, this book is refreshingly free from bluff.&nbsp; Compared to North, Geoff Ward&rsquo;s treatment of  the New York school is remote and superficial, Helen Vendler&rsquo;s reading of  Schuyler crabbed and spurious, Harold Bloom&rsquo;s version of Ashbery crudely  reductive. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As implied  by those comparisons, this book is not only an appreciation of the New York  poets.&nbsp; It is also a cogent and  persuasive argument with the dominant criticism, which in North&rsquo;s view plunders  poems for whatever conceptual capital the critic many find there.&nbsp; In that way, North&rsquo;s beef with Vendler or  Bloom is not different from Proust&rsquo;s with Saint-Beuve.&nbsp; It is the poet&rsquo;s perpetual frustration with  the coarse advertisements of idea vendors.&nbsp;  As North puts it, &ldquo;This is by no means to allege that criticism is  futile, but it is to suggest that overconfidence can be self-defeating, and  that developing this or that set of meanings out of this or that poem is at  best a clever, helpful paraphrase, and at worst a thorough distortion or reduction  or both.&rdquo;&nbsp; North identifies several  principles to guide the kind of practical criticism he advocates (and  demonstrates).&nbsp; In the tradition of  Fairfield Porter, the concluding essay pleads for &ldquo;a willingness to take poems  on their own terms.&rdquo;
        </font>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowhere will  readers find literary criticism practice with more sensitive insight, greater  imaginative sympathy, more refined taste or acuter wit than in these  essays.&nbsp; North&rsquo;s own poetic standards  are uncompromising and ambitious.&nbsp; Though  understanding that &ldquo;poets need to write badly, as well as middlingly and well,  in order to produce the &lsquo;highest thing&rsquo;, his loyalties never cause him to  refrain from noting where even our most accomplished poets falter.&nbsp; I only regret the single sense in which  North underestimates the vitality of the Poetry Project and wider New York  poetry scene.&nbsp; I wish he had addressed a  more sociologically diverse group of poets, because you will never read those  considered in this book in more thoughtful and discerning company.&nbsp; For not only is this the richest and most  suggestive study of the New York School, it is also a sustained defense of the  intellectual beauty that animates their poems. </font></p>
