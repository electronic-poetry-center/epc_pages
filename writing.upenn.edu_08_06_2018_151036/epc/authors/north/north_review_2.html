      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles  North&rsquo;s <em>The Nearness of the Way You Look  Tonight</em> marks the return to publishing of Larry Fagin&rsquo;s Adventures in  Poetry.&nbsp; It is an exceptional book by a  poet whose work has leapt to the fore the past five years.&nbsp; Following upon his selected prose <em>No Other way</em> (1998) and his <em>New and Selected Poems</em> (1999), <em>The Nearness of the Way You Look Tonight </em>confirms  that North is one of the top poets of his generation.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North&rsquo;s immediate forebears are  Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, John Ashbery and James Schuyler.&nbsp; He honors them by forming new combinations  from what he has learned from their work.&nbsp;  North is adept in many forms both conventional and original to him.&nbsp; Within these forms he has great range and  effortlessly moves from the concrete to the abstract.&nbsp; He is a poet of improvisation and discovery. He has a sense of  humor, embraces beauty for its own sake and has a gift for short poems that  grow large in the reader&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp;  Indeed, all of North&rsquo;s poems effloresce.&nbsp; If he has a subject this line from &ldquo;Note on Fog&rdquo; is one way of  putting it: &ldquo;The utter disorientation, seeing things and not seeing  things.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the heart of North&rsquo;s poems  two and sometimes more things happen at once.<br />
    <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At forty-eight pages <em>The Nearness of the Way You Look Tonight</em> recalls the &ldquo;slim volumes&rdquo; of yore.&nbsp;  Since North writes slowly these might be all the poems he had on hand,  but his book has an interior design.&nbsp;  North arranged his poems so that variations on the Richard Rodgers song  &ldquo;Younger than Springtime&rdquo; thread through the book.&nbsp; He counters Rodgers&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gayer than laughter are you / Sweet than  music are you&rdquo; with &ldquo;Smarter than morons&mdash;faster than slowpokes&mdash;&ldquo;&nbsp; North&rsquo;s oxymorons accentuate the doubling in  his work as they sustain an echo in this book, one that reminds the reader of  how much fun it is to read North&rsquo;s poems.<br />
      <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun is a risk North has long been  willing to take.&nbsp; His &ldquo;lineups&rdquo; are the  best game invented by a poet since&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve wracked my brain and not found  anything remotely in the same ballpark.&nbsp;  They are incomparable both for what they are and for their refusal to  wink at the reader.&nbsp; North is a poet  able to deliver pleasure without assuring us that it will help us build strong  bodies in twenty-seven marvelous ways.&nbsp;  He is confident that gorgeousness is good and so is plain speech.&nbsp; For him it&rsquo;s not a matter of one or the  other but of having it both ways.&nbsp; North  does not need a reason for what he does beyond the nature of his imagination  and the demands of the poem under hand.&nbsp;  The core value of North&rsquo;s work is in the freedom with which he  operates.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Risks inside art&rdquo; become  exhilarating risks for his readers.&nbsp; It  is good to read a book and be delighted by it, to feel one&rsquo;s imagination  engaged for its own sake, to get the sort of workout that poetry alone  gives.&nbsp; &ldquo;A poem is a pheasant,&rdquo; wrote  Wallace Stevens.&nbsp; <em>The Nearness of the Way You Look Tonight</em> has exactly that sort of  presence.</font></p>
