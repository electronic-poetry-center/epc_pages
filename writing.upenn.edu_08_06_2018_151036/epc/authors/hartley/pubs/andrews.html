<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>PRETEXT: A HISTORY</b></font></p>

<p>While discussion of the problems of writing an introduction to
a work might seem to have been exhausted in the various
Derridean, almost auto-erotic gestures of self-reflexivity
(&quot;I am introducing here&#151;me&#151;(into) a
translation.&quot;<font size="2">1</font>), the problem
nevertheless remains. I was asked to provide a more general
context for my discussion of Andrews's politicizing of a certain
poetic economy which would ground my readers, provide a wider
frame (more explicitly political, the connections between the
political and the poetic being made clearer, more obvious) for
the discussion that follows. How, I was asked, does Andrews fit
into the context of contemporary American poetry, into the
context of Language poetry, into the context of Marxist theory in
general? What are the critics saying about him? I want to respond
to those questions, but perhaps differently than was expected.
Since the guiding theme (if not thesis) of the Andrews piece was
the problem of context itself, I am understandably reluctant to
provide a clear and seemingly unproblematic context here. I have
done so elsewhere, in my booklength response to such a
question&#151;<i>Textual Politics and the Language Poets</i>. And
others have done so elsewhere,<font size="2">2</font> not the
least of whom were the editors of <i>Rethinking Marxism</i> in
their introduction to Charles Bernstein (Winter 1988). That
particular context exists in some place other than here.</p>

<p>I hope to approach that problem here, however, in the form of
a marginal column running the length of the original text. My
intent is to further complicate the issue, not out of some
willful perversity&#151;although it is that, especially in the
sense of a turning away from what is right and necessary, in its
relation to &quot;converse&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot; (this is
a question about the economy of verse, after all)&#151;but to
provide <i>at the level of critical commentary itself</i> the
same problems and questions and transgressions that work through
the tropic circulations and distributions of Andrews's text. For
the critical text itself is not above the difficulties of
language and ideology that many language poets seek to press into
service and to interrogate. I am interested in quite a different
critical <i>Darstellung</i> than we normally see. What follows,
then, in the margins of this discourse, is a putting into
dialog&#151;a dialogization, if you will&#151;of various texts
concerning the issues raised in the original text. Since I also
question the relationship between citation and commentary, I will
sometimes let the citations speak for themselves&#151;as if that
were possible&#151;without the usual appropriating and regulating
frame of my own critical discourse. That is not to say, however,
that my own method does not appropriate or regulate&#151;simply
that I wish to raise to consciousness those moves common to all
critical writing. Steve McCaffery has put the problem thus:
&quot;Theory's mandate to critical annexation has an inaugural
Socratic endorsement. In the <i>Apology</i> Socrates argues that
poets are the worst interpreters of their own work. . . . With
the <i>Apology</i> control of meaning enters wholly the
readerly-critical sphere. The binding status of the poem is now
that of its material inertia and the depreciation of the poet to
a non-rational silence&quot; (&quot;Appropriation as My
Beatrice,&quot; 3-4). It is in this context that I wish to
deliver the following dialog.</p>

        <p><i>Give Em Enough Rope</i>: working at the limit of
        discourse, sabotaging the machinery of ideological
        closure, this writing turns in on itself, sacrifices
        itself, in order to establish a space of possibility
        beyond itself. &quot;Ecstatic,&quot; Andrews tells us,
        &quot;in the root sense: to find yourself <i>standing
        outside yourself</i>.&quot; (&quot;Poetry as Explanation,
        Poetry as Praxis&quot; 25; hereafter &quot;Poetry&quot;).
        We are written, entrained in the structures of hegemonic
        discourse, roped in (as Andrews's title suggests) by the
        language of the oppressors. But we can use that rope, it
        seems, if not to escape from the prison towers (for we
        can never be fully outside) then at the least to measure
        its halls, its walls, to redirect ourselves through its
        passageways, to cross and recross in labyrinthine
        circuits which turn the towers in on themselves. To
        appropriate the machinery of discourse in order to put it
        to other as yet forbidden or unimagined uses.</p>

        <p>If we are asking questions about limits and
        containment, about the economy of placements and
        displacements within and between textual strata, and of
        what the political implications of this economy might be
        (depending on how, exactly, those questions are raised or
        positioned or sublated), one way of posing those
        questions is to interrogate the role of margins and
        narrative-theoretical enclosures of standard critical
        strategies, to enlist a discourse beside the
        &quot;main&quot; one, <i>a posteriori</i>.</p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="65%">Many of Andrews's common
        techniques appear here&#151;such as unconventional
        capitalization of letters, references to that which
        eludes our common knowledge (&quot;sphinxlike&quot;),
        omission of letters (&quot;pmphlet&quot;), references to
        domination and oppression, puns (&quot;Dot Your
        Eye&quot;; homophonic twists), reflexive content
        (&quot;Loco Fancy Line Vibration&quot; as a description
        of the poetic line), visual contrasts such as italics,
        and the giddy flow of unrelated words in the line which
        create their own relationships through sound and rhythm.
        All of this marshalled as a conscious political praxis, a
        breakdown of our common expectations and the possibility
        of the new.<p>This praxis begins with the premise that
        language is a constructed medium, social through and
        through, and that our unreflexive use of it condemns us
        to reconstruct the very powers and structures which seek
        to fence us in. Meaning is not out there in the world
        waiting to be incorporated into the word; it is produced
        through the socially determined networks of language and,
        hence, of power, hegemony, control. Andrews: &quot;So
        there's this process by which the sign&#151;the material
        body of the sign&#151;is transformed into meaning. It's
        allowed to make sense&#151;or not&#151;and this process
        is socially organized, or coded, at the level of
        discourse. This is a social government of meaning and
        value that's built up <i>on top of</i> the structure of
        the sign. And it enables units in a text to function both
        as signs and also as pieces of this social body, as
        materializations of social value (&quot;Total Equals
        What&quot; 51; hereafter &quot;Total&quot;). The word's
        material body is made up of its sound and inflection in
        speech and its graphic elements such as letters and
        diacritical marks in writing. The particular meaning
        attached to these sounds and letter combinations, their
        transformation into phonemes and graphemes, is the result
        of a social process. Similarly, our experiences become
        meaningful only within a social context, framed and
        thereby limited by ideology. Social events are defined
        (written) for us according to the interests of the
        hegemonic class.</p>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="35%" bgcolor="#FFFF00">For what
        is at stake is the positioning of Andrews's metadiscourse
        within a certain field of Marxist questions regarding the
        relationships between language and ideology, language as
        ideology, the languages of ideology. To begin: <p><strong>Marxist
        theory is inescapably involved in making political
        judgments about discourse, on the basis of categories
        which are necessarily provisional and are themselves
        positionally constituted. This political force of the
        concept must be retained. But if ideology is not to be
        ontologized, it should be regarded as a state of
        discourse or of semiotic systems in relation to the class
        struggle. Rather than being thought through an opposition
        to theory (a space external to the determinations of
        ideological production), it would be thought as a
        differential relation to power. Given that all discourse
        is informed by power, is constituted as discourse in
        relation to unequal patterns of power, then political
        judgments can be made in terms of particular historically
        specific appropriations of discourse by dominant social
        forces. </strong>(John Frow, <em>Marxism and Literary
        History</em>, 61)</p>

        <td>A poetry which takes its given language for granted
        consequently circulates within the framework of the
        dominant ideology, whose powers remain intact because
        hidden from consciousness. We do not challenge limits if
        we do not recognize them. According to Andrews,
        &quot;conventionally progressive literature fails to
        self-examine writing &amp; its medium, language&quot;
        (&quot;Poetry&quot; 23). But Andrews desires a poetry in
        which the &quot;act of enunciating becomes part of the
        content&#151;in a way that makes the <i>social method</i>
        become visible (and not just to illuminate the products
        that can be carried through that method)&quot;
        (&quot;Total&quot; 57). The key, then, is to reshuffle
        the elements of the language in order to reveal its
        structure (which we now become aware of because of its
        conspicuous condition of violation). The attempt to move
        outside a particular context makes that context visible
        and therefore open to conscious change. Writing such as
        Andrews's operates as Michel Foucault describes here:
        &quot;It indicates the moment when language, arriving at
        its confines, overleaps itself, explodes and radically
        challenges itself in laughter, tears, the overturned eyes
        of ecstasy, the mute and exorbitated horror of sacrifice,
        and where it remains fixed in this way at the limit of
        its void, speaking of itself in a second language in
        which the absence of a sovereign subject outlines its
        essential emptiness and incessantly fractures the unity
        of its discourse&quot; (<i>Language, Counter-Memory,
        Practice</i> 48). But the powers that be will resist that
        wrenching out of context. Jacques Derrida: &quot;To try
        to resist the removal of a textual member from its
        context is to want to remain protected against this
        writing poison. It is to want at all costs to maintain
        the boundary line between the inside and the outside of a
        context. It is to recognize the legitimacy of the
        relative specificity of each text, but it is also to
        believe that any system of writing exists in itself, as
        the relation of an inside to itself, particularly when it
        is 'true.' This amounts above all to an imposition of
        fundamentally classical limits upon generalized
        textuality. It is a kind of discontinuity prompted by
        resistance and protectionism&quot; (<i>Dissemination</i>
        316).</td>
        <td valign="top" width="35%" bgcolor="#FFFF00">What I
        want, then, is a visual analogue to this power/discourse
        economy, a proliferation of marginal texts working
        towards polyph<b>a</b>ny (visual rather than aural
        orchestration) or the polygrammatic, a textual dialog
        which writes itself across the borders without the usual

        abruptly exorcized by the realization that the order of
        presentation is non-binding, that it might have been
        arranged in an utterly different fashion, so that, as in
        a divinatory cast, all the elements are present but the
        form of their juxtapositions, the shape of their falling
        out, is merely occasional. (</b>Fredric Jameson, <i>Late

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="65%">According to Andrews,
        society and language can be seen as sharing the same
        structure of three concentric circles representing three
        different levels of specificity. We can breakdown our
        analysis of society into, first, a surface level on which
        the social order appears as &quot;a kind of decentered
        constellation of different practices, of differences, of
        pluralism, a micro-politics of fragments on this inner
        circle&quot; (&quot;Total&quot; 48-49). The second level
        can be represented as the organization of those multiple
        points in the first circle into a &quot;dominant hegemony
        and a variety of counter-hegemonies trying to challenge
        that hegemony, organized into specific functions,
        specific struggles, and specific blindnesses within
        society.&quot; Finally, we can identify a third level
        which functions as a &quot;totality, an overall horizon
        of restriction and constitution, a limit, a set of
        organizing principles within the social order.&quot; The
        parallel levels of language can be seen as, first, the
        surface production of meaning (signification). Second is
        &quot;the structure of discourses: the way in which those
        differences get organized into a polyphony&#151;of
        different voices, different literary
        traditions&#151;&quot; and put into motion. And third is
        ideology. &quot;The polyphony inside, or the
        proliferation of signs and discourse are embedded in,
        limited in certain ways by, or collusive with, or
        inscribed in different ways by: this set of limits, this
        set of ideologies, this overall body of sense that makes
        language into an archive of social effects&quot;
        (&quot;Total&quot; 49). The third levels of both
        circles&#151;the totality on the one hand and ideology on
        the other&#151;are seen as coterminous, for it is through
        ideology that the totality writes itself, demarcates
        itself, impresses itself onto the social body.</td>

        meaning-production which become visible when the limits
        and methods of conventional discourse are transgressed,
        manipulated, reappropriated, and solicited (in Derrida's
        sense in which solicitation involves the shaking of the
