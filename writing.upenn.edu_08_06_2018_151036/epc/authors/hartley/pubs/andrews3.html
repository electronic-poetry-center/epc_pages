        <td valign="top" width="65%">&quot;Swaps Ego,&quot; the
        fourth poem in <i>Rope</i>, then expands this reading of
        spatial refraction into a charting of possible subject
        positions opened up by this new attention to space and
        open movement. The title seems to refer to Benveniste's
        notion of the shifter, the pronoun slot which is filled
        by any number of subjects. The I in English holds the
        primary subject position, the reference of which changes
        each time a new subject speaks or writes. Ironically,
        then, the pronoun which seems to ground each individual's
        identity refers to an infinite possible number of <i>other</i>
        subjects in other contexts. In this sense the I swaps
        egos. But the I as pronoun ties in with another theme of
        the poem, the odyssey of the phoneme, especially those
        phonemes that are also words in themselves, such as A or
        I or, in the perverse play of this poem, U (you). The
        first five words of the poem&#151;&quot;Double You Double
        You See&quot; (p.91)&#151;are homophonic plays on the
        letters W, W, and C, which when combined (&quot;Triple
        Three Triple Three Triple&quot;) may or may not form the
        aggregate structures called morphemes. Andrews thus
        focusses on the way minimal units can be joined to
        produce meaning; the key concept in this process is
        articulation: &quot;Accidents Culmination Drift Toward
        Articulation Minister&quot; (p.92). What we have is an
        analogue to a conception of society as a
        totality&#151;not as some homogeneous entity but as the
        constellation of units whose cohesion is due their
        specific articulation, their arrangement in relation to
        one another: &quot;This may be more like a crossroads
        than a closed and fixed corpus, ready for the dissection
        table&quot; (&quot;Total&quot; 52).<p>In Althusserian
        theory the attention to the I as subject position and to
        its position as phoneme/morpheme are related in the sense
        that the subject's position in society results from the
        articulation of ideologically defined subject positions
        in that particular social formation. Each subject
        position, in other words, works something like the
        phoneme in its structuration into morphemes and of the
        morphemes themselves into complex words and sentences.
        The subject is thus written into the social syntax of a
        given totality. What interests Andrews is the possibility
        of movement and counterarticulation from those points; in
        other words, once we recognize our position within
        society, how free are we to change positions or to alter
        the given ideological charge of that spot? This is a
        question, then, of class struggle. At work in the poem,
        then, is an attempt to foreground the possibility of
        rearticulating its elements:</p>

        <td valign="top" width="35%" bgcolor="#FFFF00"><b>If
        language is historically changing and constitutive of
        subjectivity, making us as we make and use it, then it
        neither reveals nor represses some inner self, some
        &quot;species being,&quot; that exists before the fact of
        its use. If language poetry calls for the empowerment of
        all language users&#151;readers as well as
        writers&#151;it must do so by avoiding an appeal to an
        illusory &quot;real subject.&quot; The collaboration of
        writer and reader cannot be reinscribed within the
        humanism of liberation narratives:
        &quot;plot-centered&quot; stories of finding a position
        distinct from the fetishism of &quot;man&quot; and the
        fetishism of commodities is therefore central to the
        unfinished, on-going project of language poetry. (</b>The
        Editors, &quot;On Language Poetry,&quot; 76<b>)</b><p><b>These
        languages contain us, and we are simultaneously bearers
        of the codes of containment. Whatever damage or
        distortion the codes inflict on our subjectively elastic
        conception of ourselves, socially we act in an echo
        chamber of the features ascribed to us, Black woman,
        daughter, mother, writer, worker and so on. And the
        social roles and the appropriate actions are similarly
        inscribed, dwell with us as statistical likelihoods, cast
        us as queen or servant, heroic or silent, doer or done
        unto. . . . [But while language is a crucial site of
        contestation], there is nothing inherent in language
        centered projects that gives them immunity from a
        partiality that reproduces the controlling ideas of
        dominant culture. . . .Certainly writing itself cannot
        enlarge the body of opposition to the New Wars, it only
        enhances our capacity to strategically read our condition
        more critically and creatively in order to interrupt and
        to join. (</b>Erica Hunt, &quot;Notes For an Oppositonal
        Poetics,&quot; 199-200; 204; 212<b>)</b></p>

<p>How might we approach this rearticulation? &quot;By eliciting
praxis&#151;to carry out language's demand for prescriptions; for
the Anti-Obvious. By actively pressing the 'network of
differentials' in the writing itself. How to disclose &amp;
unclothe the social world: moving outward through these broader
&amp; broader layers &amp; concentric circles of intelligibility.
By a writing that counter-occludes, or counter-disguises; that
politicizes by repositioning its involvement in, its intersection
with, a nexus of historical relations&quot; (&quot;Poetry&quot;
28-9). </p>

<p>In &quot;Swaps Ego&quot; the major elements to be
rearticulated&#151;the words&#151;are accorded provisionally
equal status by capitalizing the initial letter of each word. The
sign of priority in the sentence is thus equally distributed to
all. But such egalitarian relations are not so easy to come by.
&quot;True Flip To,&quot; <i>Rope</i>'s fifth poem, dramatizes
this struggle for dominance by alternating which of two words

        forces that appears natural and inevitable and therefore
        beyond contest. So in &quot;Confidence Trick&quot;
        Andrews makes his unit of construction not the isloated
        word or phoneme but the statement. (The word
        &quot;sentence,&quot; as following examples should
        reveal, hardly fits as a description of these units,

        a larger social network, our statements are

        only in the theater of postmodernism are these ideas

        <td valign="top" colspan="2" width="65%">&quot;Intentionally
        leaderless&quot;: the poem opens with a deliberate call
        for democracy (anarchy?), yet that call is followed by
        the command to &quot;Recite this alphabet,&quot; which by
        this point in the book we recognize as a call for order
        and conventional organization into a system which writes <i>us</i>
        as we recite <i>it</i>. Nevertheless, &quot;recite&quot;
        could also be a command to re-cite, to resituate.
        Derrida: &quot;Never will any citation have so aptly
        meant both 'setting in motion' (the frequentive form of
        'to move'&#151;<i>ciere</i>) and, also since it is a
        matter of shaking up a whole culture and history in its
        fundamental text, solicitation, i.e., the shakeup of a
        whole&quot; (<i>Dissemination</i> 357). When we are then
        asked to &quot;recite catatonia chic,&quot; this may be a
        command to resituate the mind-dulling (ideological) need
        to keep up with the latest fashions which fuel the
        engines of capitalism rather than a <p>command to take
        part in this dulling process. And the former is precisely
        what Andrews attempts in his poem. He hopes to
        &quot;Capture the street severe machine&quot; of daily
        discourse that we talk and to emphasize and speed it up
        (&quot;loud fast&quot;) in order to make us approach it
        from an unusual perspective (&quot;is he
        rambling?&quot;). Diastrophism, social tectonics, rubbing
        one ideological configuration up against another. Derrida
        again: &quot;It is a Tower of Babel in which multiple
        languages and forms of writing bump into each other or
        mingle with each other, constantly being transformed and
        engendered through their most unreconcilable otherness to
        each other, an otherness which is strongly affirmed, too,
        for plurality here is bottomless and is not lived as
        negativity, with any nostalgia for lost unity. It engages
        on the contrary both writing and song&quot; (<i>Dissemination</i>
        341). Andrews exposes the rifts and mistakes which cannot
        be glossed over with &quot;the regular correction tape
        tricks.&quot; Through such a mode of attention we are
        empowered: &quot;we [too] can count.&quot; </p>
        <p><strong>STRUCTURE VERSUS ECONOMY? </strong></p>
        <p>Andrews employs a key strategy in &quot;Confidence
        Trick&quot; which helps to map the totality in ways not
        so obvious in the book's earlier works: the guiding
        metaphor for this work shifts from a focus on form and
        structure to one of economy. Steve McCaffery has written
        about the issues involved in such as shift: </p>

    <p>[The structural metaphor] tends to promote essence as
    relational, which has the clear advantage of avoiding all
    closed notions of the poem as &quot;a well-wrought urn&quot;
    but suffers from a presupposed stasis, a bracketed immobility
    among the parts under observation and specification. As an
    alternative to structure, economy is concerned with the
    distribution and circulation of the numerous forces and
    intensities that saturate a text. A textual economy would
    concern itself not with the order of forms and sites but with
    the order-disorder of circulations and distributions. </p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="65%">We need not pose the
        question, however, as a choice between discrete and
        exclusive categories. The stasis apparently inherent in
        the structural model may perhaps be due more to its
        particular uses and articulations rather than to its
        limits and possibilities. My choice of the figure of the
        diastrophe, for instance, grows out of a recognition that
        structures are never static or stable; they are
        constellations of points of pressures, dislocations,
        fusions, retractions, and so on, much as the rifts of the
        San Andreas fault are signatures of a much larger set of
        geological processes which continually restructure the
        face of the earth. All maps are provisional simply
        because all structures are in motion. Structures <i>are</i>
        economies, already. What we have is a structure of
        differences, a chain of metonymic displacements. Such is
        the nature of Andrews's &quot;Confidence Trick&quot; and
        later writings as yet to be collected in book form.
        Derrida: &quot;Every term, every germ depends at every
        moment on its place and is entrained, like all the parts
        of a machine, into an ordered series of displacements,
        slips, transformations, and recurrences that cut out or
        add a member in every proposition that has gone
        before&quot; (<i>Dissemination</i> 300). <p>Which brings
        us back to Andrews's conceptualization of the text and
        society as made up of three concentric circles. A
        possible danger of discussing the social order as three
        different levels is that the inner levels are each
        dependent on the third as the ground of their
        possibility; they are sutured and potentially
        essentialized into the very static enclosures to which
        many critiques of structuralism rightly object. The
        concept of a social <i>horizon</i> and the resulting
        strategies of mapping the totality run the same risk of
        enclosing the multiple trajectories of the social text by
        attempting to intuit the meaning of these
        &quot;polysemous&quot; texts. &quot;Polysemy,&quot;
        Derrida writes, &quot;always puts out its multiplicities
        and variations within the <i>horizon</i>, at least, of
        some integral reading which contains no absolute rift, no
        senseless deviation&#151;the horizon of the final
        parousia of a meaning at last deciphered, revealed, made
        present in the rich collection of its determinations. </p>

        appropriate, therefore, to talk about a
        &quot;horizon&quot;-value (which reminds us that it is
        simply an ideological effect) than of a horizon. For
        &quot;that 'horizon'-value, that pure infinite opening

        &quot;Writing's method, in other words, can suggest a <i>social</i>
        undecidability, a lack of successful <i>suture</i>&quot;
        (&quot;Poetry&quot; 31). It is precisely because a social
        order is not a single homogeneous entity that it requires
        ideologies to function as a sewing machine, tying up all
        the loose ends which refuse to fit easily into the
        dominant paradigm. <i>Give Em Enough</i> <i>Rope</i>

        &quot;testing the horizon, setting up a probe, by
        violating codes so that each unit keeps getting
        reframed&#151;or keeps reframing what's gone before it
        and what might come next as you challenge these wider and
        wider concentric circles of normalization, or of a
        functional fit, almost a machine-like fit that exists<i>within</i>
        the social dimension of language&quot; (&quot;Total&quot;
        58). It seeks those repressed dialogues and trajectories
        which a given ideology seeks to repress through what
        Fredric Jameson refers to as strategies of containment.</p>

        <td valign="top" width="35%" bgcolor="#FFFF00"><b>Discursive
        </b><b><i>discontinuity</i></b><b> becomes primary and
        constitutive. The discourse of radical democracy is no
        longer the discourse of the universal; the
        epistemological niche from which 'universal' classes and
        subjects spoke has been eradicated, and it has been
        replaced by a polyphony of voices, each of which
        constructs its own irreducible discursive identity. This
        point is decisive: there is no radical and plural
        democracy without renouncing the discourse of the
        universal and its implicit assumption of a privileged
        point of access to 'the truth', which can be reached by
        only a limited number of subjects. In political terms
        this means that just as there are no surfaces [such as
        class] which are </b><b><i>a priori</i></b><b> for the
        emergence of antagonisms, nor are there discursive
        regions [such as poetry] which the programme of a radical
        democracy should exclude </b><b><i>a priori</i></b><b> as
        possible spheres of struggle. (</b>Laclau &amp; Mouffe

        is a profoundly Utopian text. Andrews's negative project
        of exposing, dismantling, rerouting, disclosing,
        disseminating, and deconstructing ideological texts
        points toward the positive project suggested by Jameson
        of deciphering &quot;the Utopian impulses of these same
        ideological texts&quot; (<i>The Political Unconscious</i>
        296). The social text can be read <i>differently</i>:
        &quot;By imaging a different sense, you're beginning to
        imagine a change also in what's possible in the practical
        transactions between social individuals&#151;even to the
        point of implicating a different kind of subject: a new
        subject that could begin to coalesce, or that begins to
        coalesce around this desire to signify more
        widely&#151;and fittingly&#151;in light of 'what is,
        indeed, happening'&quot; (&quot;Total&quot; 59). What is
        at stake is possibility itself, &quot;to negate the given
        and to do so in a way that points toward some other
        anticipated future&quot; (&quot;Total&quot; 58).</td>
        <td valign="top" width="35%" bgcolor="#FFFF00"><b>Don't
        get me wrong: I know it's almost a joke to speak of
        poetry and national affairs. Yet in </b><b><i>The Social

        since our conventions are provisional, the public may
        choose to reconvene in order to withdraw authority from
        those conventions which no longer serve our purposes.
        &amp; poetry is one of the few areas where this right of
