        face="Times">Andrews's work, then, functions as a mapping
        of the social terrain. Such mapping is approached not
        &quot;just by articulating the gap by avoiding meaning
        altogether&#150;or theatricalizing that gap by avoiding
        meaning altogether&#150;but to show off a more systematic
        idea of language as a system &amp; play of differences,
        with its own rules of functioning&quot;
        (&quot;Poetry&quot; 25). It may be instructive to pursue
        the geographical analogy of mapping for a moment. One
        appropriate analogical extension involves the term
        &quot;diastrophism&quot;: &quot;the process of
        deformation that produces in the earth's crust its
        continents and ocean basins, plateaus and mountains,
        folds of strata, and faults&quot; (<i>Webster's Third</i>).
        We then have the &quot;diastrophe,&quot; [Gk <i>diastrophe</i>
        twisting, distortion, fr. <i>diastrephein</i> to twist
        about, distort, fr. <i>dia</i> + <i>strephein</i> to
        turn, twist&#150;more at STROPHE], the structural feature
        in the work which indicates (or produces, or articulates)
        the discursive faultlines, fissures, and overlappings
        which mark each ideological system. What we are concerned
        with is a discursive seismography which will record the
        tremors and vibrations produced when tectonic plates rub
        up against one another. Which raises Andrews's question,
        &quot;How to create an <i>adequacy</i>; how to be 'true
        to form'?&quot; </font></p>

        <td valign="top" width="65%"><font face="Times"><i>Give
        Em Enough</i> <i>Rope</i> approaches this task in a
        variety of ways. The title does so first of all by
        elliptically referring itself to some other context: give
        who enough rope to do what for what reason? Who is giving
        this command, and how are we equipped to carry it out? <i>Em</i>
        at first appears to be a colloquial abbreviation of the
        pronoun <i>them</i>, with the conventional apostrophe
        omitted for some unknown reason. But Em could also be an
        abbreviated form of Emma or Emily or Emiline (etc.). It
        further could refer to the letter M, which would then
        introduce the reader to Andrews's common ploy of
        presenting letters of the alphabet as characters in his
        works. And it could refer as well to the em-space of the
        typesetter, the space of a particular articulatory
        duration and emphasis, the open space of writing itself
        and of the writing of the subject-position of the reader.
        In any case, why does Em need rope? To be pulled out of
        water or a hole or off the face of a cliff or some other
        danger? Or is this an echo of Lenin's ploy of giving the
        capitalists just enough rope to hang themselves with? And
        how much rope is enough? How much might Em have already?
        This continuous deferral of a &quot;stable&quot;
        reference for the title is exactly the point, the point
        at which Andrews begins pulling out the stops, of
        rerouting our language conventions and thereby opening up
        the possibility of traversing some new terrain. For in
        the process of grappling with the multiplying possible
        references for these words, we place ourselves in the
        position of creating those possible frames of reference.

        of balance takes on a meaning of its own. At first, one

        isolated plane of reference to another at the speed of

        <td valign="top" width="65%">After ten minutes of this
        the phrases start to assume a rhythmic point of balance;
        the words take on a weight in relation to that&quot; (<i>Total
        Syntax</i> 17). But in the midst of this
        joy-in-textuality are some themes which recur in the
        book, such as the concern with expanded notions of
        perception (parallax refashion&#151;perhaps <i>the</i>
        goal of Andrews's work), contradiction both in terms of
        Marxian social theory and in terms of speaking against
        (contra/diction; conflicting discourses), and the
        material character of units of discourse which we put
        into motion (&quot;u / e&quot; becomes
        &quot;urine&quot;). Watten writes that &quot;Andrews's
        poem is a kind of fantastic machine, each line a conveyor
        belt of semiotic rubble, funny poking things&#151;to flip
        on the switch is to get action. . . . In this poem there
        is a solution not imagined by William Carlos Williams to
        his proposition, in the 1944 introduction to <i>The Wedge</i>,
        that a poem be a 'machine made of words.' Where
        Williams's machine is a self-contained entity, a whole
        consisting of interacting parts, each of which is
        necessary for the functioning of the other, in Andrews
        there is no limit to the whole, and the machine consists
        of placing in motion a sequence of unrelated parts found
        in the world at large&quot; (<i>Total Syntax</i> 160).
        While it is true that there is no immediate limit to the
        whole in this poem (questioning such limits is one of the
        poem's concerns), the &quot;unrelated parts&quot; become
        related through contiguity, repetition, thematic
        coherence, and simply through the onward rush and
        semantic flow of the poem itself. These brief flashes
        from the streets, newspapers, textbooks, etc., speak to
        and through each other as the poem develops according to
        what Andrews refers to as &quot;framing frenzy,&quot; the
        goal of which is &quot;to open up new relationships by
        crazed collision&quot; (&quot;Poetry&quot; 31).</td>

        left-wing ideology into bullet-poems is not really worth
        the trouble of my extended attention, except as a

        oppression, sexual oppression (particularly in marriage),

        moments of semantic foregrounding and thematic
        interweaving. It is no longer contentless, although it
        remains an affirmation of rupture &amp; divestiture. What
        we have is no longer simply a polymorphous pleasure in
        the text (though that remains) but an attempt to exhibit
        the process of meaning construction by allowing these
        disparate words and phrases to meld occasionally into
        recognizable themes and then quickly to break apart into
        competing tangents of content. What we have is a
        recognition that while we might try to abandon content,
        it is nevertheless constructed around us. The job now is
        to reveal the processes of its construction and to
        suggest the possibility of <i>alternative</i>
        constructions. But those alternatives will involve
        struggle; we cannot appropriate the means of production

        underscore the variability of form, movement, structure,
        economy. Here we face a list of units (words, phrases,
        occasional sentences) much as we would an inventory of
        products, the units continuously isolated by the breaking
        of the line and syntax. On one level, the poem mimics the
        reductive quantification (reification) of capitalist
        economics. Ironically, the title is followed by the
        parenthetical mention that the poem is a score for
        movement in a poem with very little sense of movement at
        all. There is an extension of relationship through
        sequential accretion, but the overall impression is that
        of a stack of isolated signifiers resisting any
        integration beyond the line break. Even within the line
        the movement from word to word is impeded, the rhythm
        more stocatto and metronomic than the fluid rhythms of

        yet an insistence that meaning can exist in unison in a
        poem where the only unison that is allowed to develop is
        the fragmented and isolated state of the line which leads
        to an apparent equivalency of units. The only site of
        production appears to be the highlighted vacant anus.
        While someone is &quot;Ill at ease in two dimension&quot;
        (p.36), that is the only dimension that this geometry
        offers. The movement is that of enclosure into various
        shapes (dodecahedrons, triangles, hexagons) which
        privileges the inside and excludes the out:
        &quot;Obstruct immigrants at border&quot; (p.40).
        &quot;She thus carved for herself a small oedipal
        territory that will resound with all the paranoic
        tendencies of the institution&quot; (p.48). In such a
        context the statement &quot;We all live in
        Pennsylvania&quot; (p.48), while intended to show the
        interrelatedness of all on earth (even Europeans are
        affected by Three Mile Island), ironically reveals also
        that we all inhabit the same box.</font><p><font
        face="Times">The poem &quot;Give Em Enough Rope&quot;
        develops on a new structural plane: no longer
        specifically foregrounding motion (or the lack of it),
        the title poem explores the possibilities of spatial
        refraction. Now each page is a visual unit which
        organizes its material as well as the reader's eye
        movement in a variety of ways. The first page, for
        instance, is in paragraph form, both margins justified
        and enlarged (squeezing the text in on itself), and is
        made up of one extremely long sentence:</font></p>

        articulation between social relations. is necessary in

        at work in Andrews's writing over a certain period: <b>The
        opposite of utopia, plus ten years, would seem here to be
        total estrangement.</b> But that ten years has provided
        these poets with a more valuable working model than their
        earlier symbolic explosions: <b>What Andrews has learned
        from this project, as hard as it may be to take, is
        virtually constitutive of contemporary public space:
        &quot;failure to acknowledge seems like a natural
        fact.&quot; </b>Andrews's political strategy now is to
        acknowledge our lack of acknowledgement, <b>to return us

<table border="0" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="65%"><font face="Times">In the
        paragraph the words are forced together into a block of
        text, as prose pages often are. But the enlargment of the
        margins, the magnification of the white space, ironically
        underscores the enclosure of that blank margin space:
        while blank space may on the one hand appear as open
        possibility, on the prose page it works in the opposite
        way by defining (delimiting) within its quadrants the
        possibilitities of praxis within that space. It imposes
        (because of our conventional reading habits) the desire
        for accuracy (as the first word suggests) and meaning by
        lining words up &quot;side by side&quot;; the
        &quot;spinning &amp; warming&quot; of the scattered pages
        &quot;only transpose&quot; words from one possible
        reference to another, but the paragraph attempts to pin
        those references down, to order their wandering into a
        sequence. White space on the scattered page, however,
        does open up new possibilities because it breaks down the
        effects of &quot;linarchy&quot; and allows the reader to
        chart new paths as in a connect-the-dots puzzle with no
        prescribed numbers, to make connections between words by
        a variety of routes besides the left-to-right,
        top-to-bottom pattern we usually follow. The second page,
        interestingly, still bears the imprint of linarchy,
        however, for the lines between &quot;lives inevitable and
        leaving&quot; and &quot;inevitable justice&quot; attempt
        to realign the words along a left margin. But the word
        &quot;Bullshit&quot; pulls the page out of this trance
        once more, contradicting in the process the (Social
        Democratic?) belief that ustice would be inevitable in
        such a lineated arrangement. While the third page does
        succeed in asserting the justified left margin once more,
        the fourth then opens up an enormous range of space and
        direction, its structural principle perhaps summed up in
        the first four words (out of only nine on the page):
        &quot;architecture/ piss in powder&quot; (p.55). The
        &quot;physiognomic cartography&quot; (p.85) of the poem
        expands our reading of surface space beyond the confines
        of a road map. We now have something like a topographical
        map which shows us other possibilities of movement around
        the rifts and fissures of this (social) space, a reading
        of the diastrophic collisions of different tectonic
        masses.</font></td>
