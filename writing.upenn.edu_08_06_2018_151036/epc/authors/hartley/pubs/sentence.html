<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>I.</strong></font></p>

<p>Not this. </p>

<p>What then? </p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;I am going to make an argument,
that there is such a thing as a new sentence and that it occurs
thus far more or less exclusively in the prose of the Bay
Area&quot;</font> (63). </p>

<p>Which implies, of course, that there is such a thing as an old
sentence and that it occurs in the prose from elsewhere. What,
then, characterizes the old sentence? Its <font color="#000080">&quot;hypotactic
logic,&quot; </font>the <font color="#000080">&quot;syllogistic
leap, or integration above the level of the sentence&quot;</font>
necessary for telling referential stories (79). As in the
following passage from &quot;The New Sentence&quot; essay: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">The French found the prose poem to
    be an ideal device for the dematerialization of writing. Gone
    were the external devices of form that naggingly held the
    reader in the present, aware of the physical presence of the
    text itself. Sentences could be lengthened, stretched even
    further than the already extensive elocutions which
    characterized Mallarm&eacute;'s verse, without befuddling the
    reader or disengaging her from the poem. And longer sentences
    also suspended for greater periods of time the pulse of
    closure which enters into prose as the mark of rhythm. It was
    perfect for hallucinated, fantastic and dreamlike contents,
    for pieces with multiple locales and times squeezed into a
    few words.</font> (81) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These hypotactic sentences lead the reader away from the
sentence itself to a concept beyond, in this case to a concept of
a language which does not so naggingly hold the reader in the
present of the text. The dematerialization of writing. </p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;But note that there is no attempt
whatsoever to prevent the integration of linguistic units into
higher levels. These sentences take us not toward the recognition
of language, but away from it&quot;</font> (82). </p>

<p>But why would someone choose to focus on this point? </p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;The sentence, hypotactic and
complete, was and still is an index of class in society&quot;</font>
(79). </p>

<p>There's an analogy here somewhere. But first a genealogical
note: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">Prose fiction to a significant
    extent derives from the narrative epics of poetry, but moves
    toward a very different sense of form and organization.
    Exterior formal devices, such as rhyme and linebreak,
    diminish, and the structural units become the sentence and
    paragraph. In the place of external devices, which function
    to keep the reader's or listener's experience at least partly
    in the present, consuming the text, most fiction foregrounds
    the syllogistic leap, or integration above the level of the
    sentence, to create a fully referential tale</font> (79). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it wasn't always so. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">If we argue&#151;and I am
    arguing&#151;that the sentence, as distinct from the
    utterance of speech, is a unit of prose, and if prose as
    literature and the rise of printing are inextricably
    interwoven, then the impact of printing on literature, not
    just with the presentation of literature, but on how the
    writing itself is written, needs to be addressed. This would
    be the historical component of any theory of the sentence</font>
    (73). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The imprint of Gutenberg. It wasn't always so. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">Within tribal societies the
    individual has not yet been reduced to wage labor, nor does
    material life require the consumption of a vast number of
    commodities, objects created through the work of others.
    Language likewise has not yet been transformed into a system
    of commodities, nor subjected to a division of labor in its
    functions through which the signified overwhelms the
    signifier. In contrast, where the bourgeois is the rising
    class, the expressive gestural, labor-product nature of
    consciousness tends to be repressed. Objects of
    consciousness, including individual words and even
    abstractions, are perceived as commodities and take on this
    'mystical' character of fetish </font>(11). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's an analogy here. But first a note from Marx: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#008000">. . . the productions of the human
    brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and
    entering into relation both with one another and the human
    race. . . . [Value] does not stalk about with a label
    describing what it is. It is value, rather, that converts
    every product into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, we try to
    decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of our
    own social products; for to stamp an object of utility as a
    value, is just as much a social product as language. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fetishism of commodities:</strong> a commodity's value
is seen as a natural constituent of the product itself, not as an
effect of the social process of exchange (<font color="#008000">&quot;the
equalization of the most different kinds of labour&quot;</font>&#151;Marx).
</p>

<p><strong>Fetishism of language:</strong> a signifier's meaning
is seen as a natural constituent of the word itself, not as an
effect of the social process of language. </p>

<p>Bourgeois realism foregrounds the syllogistic leap at the
expense of the perception of language as a labor process. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">What happens when a language moves
    toward and passes into a capitalist stage of development is
    an anaesthetic transformation of the perceived tangibility of
    the word, with corresponding increases in its expository,
    descriptive and narrative capacities, preconditions for the
    invention of &quot;realism,&quot; the illusion of reality in
    capitalist thought. These developments are directly tied to
    the function of reference in language, which under capitalism
    is transformed, narrowed into referentiality. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">Reference possesses the character of
    a relationship of a movement to an object, such as the
    picking up of a stone to be used as a tool </font>(10) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Language as a tool: <font color="#000080">&quot;the completed
tool is a sentence&quot;</font> (78). </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">A hammer, for example, consists of a
    face, a handle, and a peen. Without the presence of all
    three, the hammer will not function. Sentences relate to
    their subunits in just this way. Only the manufacturer of
    hammers would have any use for disconnected handles; thus
    without the whole there can be no exchange value. Likewise,
    it is at the level of the sentence that the use value and the
    exchange value of any statement unfold into view. The child's
    one-word sentence is communicative precisely because ( and to
    the degree that) it represents a whole. Any further
    subdivision would leave one with an unusable and
    incomprehensible fragment </font>(78). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unusable fragments: the whole as a utilitarian value. Marx's
notion of commodity fetishism depends on his distinction between
use-value and exchange-value. <font color="#008000">&quot;The
utility of a thing makes it a use-value. But this utility is not
a thing of the air. Being limited to the physical properties of
the commodity, it has no existence apart from that
commodity.&quot;</font> Exchange-value, on the other hand, exists
as an abstraction apart from the commodity, its physical
properties no longer in sight. What determines the exchange-value
of the commodity is not any quality of the product itself but the
quantity of labor time that went into its making; that is,
exchange-value is a social relation, a result of the labor
process. Marx: <font color="#008000">&quot;So far no chemist has
ever discovered exchange-value either in a pearl or a
diamond.&quot; </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hammer: parts (face, handle, peen) </p>
    <p>Sentence: subunits (words, phrases, clauses) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Silliman claims to discover is that the sentence is the
hinge between fragments and wholes, the privileged point of focus
for his study of reification in language. Use-value depends on
the material of the object itself, while exchange-value ignores
that material in order to pass on to something beyond the object
(the apotheosis of such being money). By analogy, the use-value
of a linguistic object involves a concentration on the
materiality of that object (rhyme, rhythm, line breaks), whereas
exchange-value in language involves passing through the language
to something else&#151;meaning. The sentence is the smallest
written unit, according to Silliman, which leads to a complete
statement (exchange-value), yet the sentence in isolation tends
to be the largest unit which can be viewed as a material object
(use-value). </p>

<p>Pre-bourgeois language use emphasized, drew attention to, both
levels of language. The same was true, Marx claims, for the
pre-bourgeois view towards the commodity: <font color="#008000">&quot;Compulsory
labour is just as properly measured by time, as the
commodity-producing labour; but every serf knows that what he
expends in the service of his lord, is a definite quantity of his
own personal labour-power. The tithe to be rendered to the priest
is more matter of fact than his blessing. . . . [The] social
relations between individuals in the performance of their labour,
appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations, and
are both disguised under the shape of social relations between
the products of labour.&quot; </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>II </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;The question is contextual, not
textual&quot;</font> (21). </p>

<p>The attraction of <em>Tender Buttons</em> for poet Ron
Silliman lies in Stein's use of the sentence rather than the line
as the unit of composition. Objects juxtaposed for friction:
Cubist perspective. In standard prose sentences are arranged
within the paragraph in syllogistic order, one premise
contributing logically to the preceding and succeeding ones.
Stein's arrangement challenges syllogistic expectations. <font
color="#000080">&quot;The syllogistic move above the sentence
level to an exterior reference is possible,&quot; </font>Silliman
writes, <font color="#000080">&quot;but the nature of the book
reverses the direction of this movement. Rather than making the
shift in an automatic and gestalt sort of way, the reader is
forced to deduce it from the partial views and associations
posited in each sentence&quot;</font> (84). </p>

<p><em>Tender Buttons</em> thus presages &quot;The New
Sentence,&quot; which Silliman characterizes as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">1) The paragraph [rather than the
    stanza] organizes the sentences; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">2) The paragraph is a unit of
    quantity, not logic or argument; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">3) Sentence length [rather than the
    line] is a unit of measure; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">4) Sentence structure is altered for
    torque, or increased polysemy/ambiguity; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">5) Syllogistic movement is (a)
    limited (b) controlled; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">6) Primary syllogistic movement is
    toward the paragraph as a whole, or the total work; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">7) Secondary syllogistic movement is
    toward the paragraph as a whole, or the total work; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">8) The limiting of syllogistic
    movement keeps the reader's attention at or very close to the
    level of language, the sentence level or below. </font>(91) </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an example from his<em> Tjanting</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">Forcing oneself to it. It wldv'e
    been new with a blue pen. Giving oneself to it. Of about to
    within which what without. Hands writing. Out of the rockpile
    grew poppies. Sip mineral water, smoke cigar. Again I began.
    One sees seams. These clouds break up in the late afternoon,
    blue patches. I began again but it was not beginning. Somber
    hue of gray day sky filled the yellow room. Ridges &amp;
    bridges. Each sentence accounts for all the rest. I was I
    discovered on the road. Not this. Counting my fingers to get
    different answers. Four chairs in the yard, rain-warpd,
    wind-blown. Cat on the bear rug naps. Grease sizzles &amp;
    spits on the stove top. In paradise plane wrecks are
    distributed evenly throughout the desert. All the same, no
    difference, no blame. Moon's rise at noon. In the air hung
    odor of ammonia. I felt disease. Not not not-this. Reddest
    red contains trace of blue. That to the this then. What words
    tear out. All elements fit into nine crystal structures.
    Waiting for the cheese to go blue. Thirty-two. Measure meters
    pause. Applause. </font>(12) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite its inverted syntax, <font color="#000080">&quot;Out
of the rockpile grew poppies&quot;</font> is a fairly ordinary
sentence. Coming right after &quot;Hands writing,&quot; however,
this sentence seems to demand to be encapsulated between
quotation marks, presented as an example of what hands write
rather than as a direct statement to be taken at face value.
&quot;Rockpile&quot; is then metonymically recalled in the
following sentence in &quot;mineral water,&quot; while the
self-conscious attention to usually-rote actions, sipping and
smoking, refers back to &quot;Hands writing.&quot; Not much later
the rockpile becomes recontextualized even further by <font
color="#000080">&quot;One sees seams,&quot;</font> referring in
part to the reader's perception of Silliman's writing process
itself&#151;the deliberate focussing of attention on the
contextualizing process of writing&#151;the rockpile now becoming
a trope for the pile of sentences which is <em>Tjanting, </em>out
of which, despite superficial appearances, meaning coheres and
accretes. The gaps between sentences (the locus of tension or
torque), the visible seams, here take the place of the line break
and draw our attention to the materiality of the words as words,
not simply as transparent signifiers. </p>

<p>In discussing Carla Harryman's poem, &quot;For She,&quot;
Silliman tells us that <font color="#000080">&quot;What endows
Harryman's piece with precisely the intensity or power that makes
it worthy of our consideration are the many ways in which
individual sentences are not 'in free-standing isolation.' The
charged use of pronouns, the recurrence of the name Maxine, the
utilization of parallel structures ('I wavered, held her up. I
tremble, jack him up.') or of terms extending from the same bank
of images, notably water, are all methods for enabling secondary
syllogistic movement to create or convey an overall impression of
unity, without which the systematic blocking of the integration
of sentences one to another through primary syllogistic movement
(not how those parallel sentences operate in different tenses, or
how the second one turns on that remarkably ambiguous, possibly
sexual, verb 'jack') would be trivial, without tension, a 'heap
of fragments.' Nonetheless, any attempt to explicate the work as
a whole according to some 'higher order' of meaning, such as
narrative or character, is doomed to sophistry, if not overt
incoherence. The new sentence is a decidedly contextual object.
Its effects occur as much between, as within, sentences. Thus it
reveals that the blank space, between words or sentences, is much
more than the 27th letter of the alphabet. It is beginning to
explore and articulate just what those hidden capacities might
be&quot;</font> (92). </p>

<p>In this paragraph we see, perhaps more clearly than anywhere
else, what Silliman looks for in a poem, and why the new sentence
fulfills his demands: </p>

<p>1) intensity; 2) power; 3) a charged use of linguistic units;
4) recurrence; 5) parallel structures; 6) a common image bank; 7)
secondary syllogistic movement; 8) the systematic blocking of
primary syllogistic movement; 9) varied tenses; 10) ambiguity;
11) importance; 12) tension; 13) an exploration and articulation
of the hidden capacities of the blank space (parataxis). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>III. Final Frontier </strong></font></p>

<p>I am going to make an argument, that there is no such thing as
a new sentence. </p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;The proposition of a new sentence
suggests a general understanding of sentences per se, against
which an evolution or shift can be contrasted. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;This poses a first problem. There
is, in the domain of linguistics, philosophy and literary
criticism, no adequate consensus [as] to the definition of a
sentence. Odd as that seems, there are reasons for it&quot;</font>
(63). </p>

<p>The sentence is a <font color="#000080">&quot;primary unit of
language&quot;</font> (65). But linguistics, philosophy, and
literary criticism all have <font color="#000080">&quot;rendered
the question of the sentence invisible&quot; </font>(69). Why
does the sentence insist on slipping from view? </p>

<p>Here <font color="#000080">&quot;is an important insight,
which is that modes of integration which carry words into phrases
and phrases into sentences are not fundamentally different from
those by which an individual sentence integrates itself into the
larger work&quot;</font> (75). The sentence stands somewhere
between words/phrases and the larger work, between the fragment
and the syllogism. But what becomes of this distinction if
fragments become wholes? </p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;The child's one-word sentence is
communicative precisely because (and to the degree that) it
represents a whole. Any further subdivision would leave one with
an unusable and incomprehensible fragment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Yet longer sentences are
themselves composed of words, many, if not all, of which, in
other contexts, might form adequate one-word sentences. Thus the
sentence is the hinge unit of any literary product&quot;</font>
(78). </p>

<p>The sentence, then, is a function of context, and context is a
function of the desire for the whole. So what can legitimately be
seen as a fragment? </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">Someone called Douglas. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">Someone called Douglas over. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">He was killed by someone called
    Douglas over in Oakland.</font> (74) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Someone called Douglas&quot; is only a fragment when it
is seen as part of a larger whole. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">Soil of the rock. The turtle is not
    the cure of the learning which it snows. My breath are small
    here. Only, we defines, is struggle day. One voice, coming
    from several parts of the room, or brain. Hedged the idea,
    conditions the thing. The lower the corner, the higher the
    porch. Rags from the garbage bags. These are really personal
    and have no other universe. More in which porridge eat. Great
    mime of stone chose in the east crowd. Saw of cruel, loss of
    circus. A cat I suddenly expected to spray.</font> (The Age
    of Huts 114) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are these fragments or simply sentences which have absorbed
the paratactic order that in <em>Tjanting</em> usually occurs
&quot;above&quot; the level of the sentence? <font
color="#000080">&quot;Syntax, that lineating element, also has a
habit of reinserting itself in even the smallest of phrases. As
Robert Grenier has shown, the organization of letters into a
single word already presumes the presence of a line&quot;</font>
(62).<font color="#000080"> &quot;Stein . . . [equates] clauses,
which divide as indicated into dependent and independent, with
sentences. Anything as high up the chain of language as a clause
is already partially a kind of sentence. It can move
syllogistically as a sentence in itself to a higher order of
meaning&quot; </font>(86). </p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;The sentence is the horizon, the
border between these two fundamentally distinct types of
integration&quot;</font> (87). </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>sentence = horizon </p>
    <p>sentence = hinge </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am going to make an argument, that there is no such thing as
a sentence, new or otherwise. The sentence is not; it functions
as the spacing between desire and fulfillment. Derrida: <font
color="#008000">&quot;What counts here is the formal or
syntactical praxis that composes and decomposes it&quot;</font> (<em>Dissemination</em>
220). The sentence articulates the gesture towards totality. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#008000">Roast potatoes for.</font> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">The answer to these questions is to
    be found in how we conceive the part:whole relations of the
    poem. Each device is determined by its relationship to the
    whole. This might be called the first axiom of the poetic
    device, to which we must add a second, based on the
    implications of the privilege given to expectation, to the
    process of experiencing, in the generation of semantic shifts
    at all levels: there is no such thing as a whole. This is
    because time divides the poem: it can never, even on
    completion, be experienced 'at once.' The reader is always at
    some point with regard to the reading. This placement
    organizes the interpretation of details, including any
    ambiguities, but only temporarily. The perceptibility of a
    device, in fact, depends upon the reader's recognition of the
    process of reorganization itself </font>(122). </p>
