Just before his death in November 1694, Matsuo
<A HREF="http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~hartleyg/EPC/download/basholink.html">Basho</A> wrote the following haiku:

This "road," Sam Hamill tells us in his moving afterword to his important
new translation of Basho's travelogues, is at once the road of poetry, the
road of Zen practice, and the road of life itself. All of these are one for
Basho. So it was through his lifelong development of the Way of Poetry. In
the autumn of his life Basho concerned himself with this road without a single
soul; not only do we travel this road alone, but even the status of our own
self ultimately has no meaning when confronted with the lonely depths of
an autumn evening.

The Basho we get in Hamill's translation is the Zen poet pilgrim. As in
<A HREF="http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~hartleyg/EPC/download/matthiessen.html">Peter Matthiessen's</A> <I>The Snow Leopard,</I>
Basho's works illustrate the unity of the journey and Zen practice.

      Hamill's collection emphasizes this insight by centering on Basho's travelogues:
      the infamous <I>Narrow Road to the Interior,</I> a long meditation on the
      ecstasy and the sorrow of each moment of awareness; <I>Travelogue of
      Weather-Beaten Bones,</I> a record of Basho's pilgrimage on the path of his
      spiritual and poetic master, Saigyo;<I> The Knapsack Notebook,</I> an exploration
      of the fusion of pilgrimage and poetry; and the <I>Sarashina Travelogue,</I>
      an account of his trip to see the harvest moon rise over Mount Obasute. The
      travelogues are then followed by an 82-page selection of Basho's haiku.</TD>

This structure of Hamill's collection provides for an instructive way of
viewing Basho's haiku. In the travelogues the haiku are interwoven with narrative
passages that place each haiku in the context of its inspirational circumstances.
For example, in the selcetion of haiku we read:

As a single poem these lines are beautifully haunting and evocative, moreso
because of their ambiguity. Why are the birds crying out? Are these cries
of joy or of sorrow? Are they celbrating or lamenting the passing of spring?
Is spring even directly related to this crying, or is it simply functioning
as contextual background? In either case, the idea of fishes' tears being
distingushable from the water in which they swim is at once amusing and
mysterious, engaging that mental twist of koan paradox. But consider this
haiku in its prosaic context:

	    Mount Fuji just a shadow, I set out under the cherry blossoms of Ueno and

	    and followed along far enough to see me off from the boat. Getting off at
	    Senju, I felt three thousand miles rushing through my heart, the whole world
	    only a dream. I saw it through farewell tears.</FONT>

Now we see the haiku as a response to Basho's sorrow at leaving his friends
for his pilgrimage. The crying of birds and fish presents a sympathetic fusion
of Basho and his world&#151;his sorrow is so great that tears form even in
the eyes of fish. This fusion, occuring on many levels, is perhaps the most
striking element of Basho's travelogues.

      Haibun is the term for this fusion at the formal level, the level at which
      haiku and prose are combined. This provides for a formal dialogue between
      the poem and the narrative in which each inflects and thereby enriches the
      other. This is one level at which Hamill's collection especially excels,
      both in the insight we get into Basho's aesthetics through his works and
      through the explanatory passages of Hamill's own introduction and afterword.
      Here Hamill explains, for example, that two fundamental principles underlie
      Basho's poetics, <I>kokoru </I>(the heart/mind aspect of the poem) and
      <I>makoto </I>(sincerity, directness). The direct sincerity of Basho's writings,
      seen in his spare yet elegant style, functions as an attempt to go right
      to the heart of things, to see the relationship between core and surface.
      But this core of reality is not some distant, abstract essence; it is insight
      into things as they are (a point also strongly emphasized by Robert Aitken
      in his book on Basho's haiku, <I>A Zen Wave</I>). This insight is summed
      up by the phrase <I>mono-no-aware,</I> the perception of the natural poignancy
      of temporal things. Like the dropping cherry blossoms, we too will wither
      and die. This insight, crucial to Zen, leads us beyond simple attachment
      to temporal things, demanding the full experience of the present moment,
      here and now.

The title of Basho's most famous travelogue, <I>Narrow Road to the Interior,
</I>plays on his concern for the heart of things. On one level the "interior"
refers to the wilderness region called Oku north of Sendai. The narrow road
passes through the Shirakawa Barrier, over the mountains. Yet the title also
refers to the path of Zen as a practice of experiencing the void of the self
at the heart of all experience. Like <I>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance, </I>Basho's book reveals that the journey itself is the destination.
"<FONT COLOR="Green">A lifetime adrift in a boat</FONT>," Basho writes,
"<FONT COLOR="Green">or in old age leading a tired horse into the years,
every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home</FONT>" (3).
<P ALIGN=Justify>
If Hamill's translations have a weakness, it is in fact their rare failure
to convey this immediate attention to the here and now. While Hamill's
translations tend to be more aesthetically pleasing than Aitken's, they
nevertheless at times overlook a recurrent syntactical move of Basho's: the
isolation and emphasis of a phrase by the emphatic element <I>ya. Ya</I>
functions as the exclamation point does in English, and consequently the
phrase preceding it should stand in stark immediacy. Hamill translates the
first line of the haiku with which I open this review as "All along this
road" (<I>Kono michi ya</I>). But Aitken, emphasizing the <I>ya,</I> writes,
"This road!" The road (<I>tao</I> in Chinese, <I>michi</I> in Japanese) is
central to the experience, not simply background or setting for the experience
of emptiness or loneliness. This road is not just a figurative vehicle for
expressing the road of poetry or Zen or life; this road, the actual physical
road leading into the interior, is poetry, Zen, life. There is no distinction
between literal and figurative experience. Hamill's awareness of this key
element of Basho's poetics, despite any momentary lapses in translation,
is what makes this collection and translation especially poignant and moving.
Hamill's strength is exactly this fidelity to the beauty of Basho's work,
a beauty which, Hamill tells us, lies in the poet's adherence to the belief
that "each poem is the only poem."
