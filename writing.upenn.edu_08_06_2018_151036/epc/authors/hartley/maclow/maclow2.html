the Dancers</I>, drawn from by systematic chance methods. Other action packs
used for <I>Nuclei for Simone Forti</I> and <I>The Marrying Maiden, a Play
of Changes</I>.
<P>
In <I>The Pronouns</I> these cards, woven together by both chance and choice
into forty poems, are scores realized by dancers. The value of dancing the
poems lies in "<FONT COLOR="Navy">finding concrete meanings as actions</FONT>"
(RW 181). Although chance plays a major role in the composition of Mac Low's
works, those works once written are to be seen as determinate and meaningful.
The performance/realization of these poems makes randomly organized units
concrete through action. Mac Low continually insists that although the dancers
have "<FONT COLOR="Navy">a very large degree of freedom of
interpretation</FONT>," they nevertheless must "<FONT COLOR="Navy">find <I>some
definite interpretation of the meaning of every line</I> of the dance-poems
they choose to realize</FONT>" (RW 180-1; his emphasis).

In "Asymmetry 204" the index word is "still." Thus the "S" is spelled out
by "still," the "T" by "took," the "I" by "island," and so on until "still"
is completely spelled out. The second strophe then spells out the second
word of the first strophe, "took." The third strophe spells out "island,"
and the fourth and fifth "little." The number of words or events (see "eventual
verse" below) in the <I>Asymmetries</I> is determined in each strophe by
the number of letters in its index word, providing for a varying number of
events in each strophe (hence "asymmetry"). In the <I>Stanzas</I>, on the
other hand, each strophe spells out the same index string and thus is parallel
to (symmetrical with) all other strophes.

      summer 1960. Maybe it was the emphasis on asymmetrical design in Zen Buddhist
      aesthetics. . . . Perhaps it was my admiration for the irregular verse of
      Ezra Pound and of such contemporaries of mine as Paul Blackburn and Larry
      Eigner. . . . Possibly it was just that "I'd had it" with stanzas and
      symmetry&#151;seven years of it after December 1954.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="Red"><B>EVENTUAL VERSE</B></FONT><B>: </B>1) the constitutive
units of the lines are not feet but "events" (words, word-strings, silences).
2) Consequently, the determining structure is not primarily phonological
or metrical (although poems such as "Asymmetry 204" are beautifully rhythmic).
3) Corresponding lines of stanzas have the same number of events in them
because 4) the number of events in a line is determined by the number of
letters in a word (the same word being the index for the same line in each
stanza). 5) The number of lines in a stanza is determined by the number of
words in the index string ("Call Me Ishamel" resulting in three-line stanzas).
<P>
To call these units "events" suggests something of Mac Low's perspective
on poetry. The poem is not made up of a collection of things; it is instead
a series of events. Poetry = Process. Each event is to be realized through
our actions (reading, performing), our actions conferring meaning to even
the most minimal and disjunct of units. The poem is seen as a potential
meaning-event, not as a record or reflection of a prior meaning having taken
place in the "author's" mind and then transcribed onto the page.

      of performance texts begun in 1961. The letters of their words are placed
      in the squares of qudrille ("graph") paper, and they are realized through
      spontaneous, but rule-guided, performers' choices, usually, but not always,
      made during performances.</FONT>
      <P>
      <FONT COLOR="Navy">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Sanskrit word <I>gatha</I>, "verse" or
      "hymn," was adopted for them, on analogy with its use to&nbsp;designate versified
      sections of Buddhist sutras and short poems by Zen masters and students,
      because I considered Gathas to be Buddhist performance texts. Chance operations
      were used in&nbsp;composing them in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;encourage performers
      and hearers to&nbsp;give "bare attention" to letter-sounds, words, etc. Also
      a Buddhist de-emphasis of the composer's ego underlies both using compositional
      chance operations and&nbsp;letting performers' choices determine many parameters
      of their realization. In addition, all&nbsp;Gathas made from 1961 to
      1973&#151;and many made later&#151;are composed of chance-arranged
      transliterations of mantras, most of them Buddhist. However, beginning with
      <I>The Black Tarantula Crossword Gathas</I> in 1973, many&nbsp;Gathas have
      been composed of&nbsp;nonmantric English words. Both mantric and nonmantric
      Gathas appear in this book.</FONT>

Mac Low has written a profound love poem. We all long for "My you," a you
of our own. The "you" as pronoun underscores the position of the loved one
as am empty meaning-slot, a position of function to be filled by different
people for different people. This "you" is not some universal love object
but someone in particular who awakens certain responses in this particular
lover. This "gain" of "my you" leads to "rainy life," which can be read in
its implications of fecundity (water as life source, rebirth) as well as
its somber implications (no relationship is without its rainy days, no gain
is achieved without some loss or hardship). "See," eyes now open, "the Here
end" (be here now, the beauty of the present moment). "Gain rainy end again,"
in love again after loss (or perhaps this again is a love lost?) "see the/
Feet," bare, in bed, or keeping us standing. "Utter" words of love, learn
to speak the language of love. "Cry know," exulting in new-found knowledge.
"Is Now" reaffirms our presentness; this really is happening. "The outside"
becomes inside "when Now," fully present, intercorporeal plenitude. The Other
is known now. Pause. The void of life outside has ended now. Cry "know,"
my you; gain is rainy life. Repetition, inundation.
