The question might be put thus: "Where does poetry come from?" The standardized
response, of course, is "From the poet," a perpetuated misunderstanding of
the role of the ego in Romantic thought. (See Wordsworth's "half-perceive,
half-create" as a step towards an antidote; the poet does only half the work.)
But as cautious as we may be about accepting standardized responses, we cannot
accept the opposite possibility, that poetry comes wholly from without. Poetry
is not simply the representation of the external.
<P>
Ego/Representation/External: enter Jackson Mac Low. The question is about
representation, but not in the usual sense (re. reference). Mac Low offers
a poetry of re-presentation of language itself; language must speak itself
through him. Poetry: an exploration of and confrontation with one's
environment&#151;getting to know one's element. Just how important environmental
awareness is to Mac Low is evident in the following advice to performers:

    <TD><FONT COLOR="Navy">Sensitivity, tact, and courtesy must be exercized
      in order to make every detail of one's performance contribute toward a total
      sound sequence that is as similar as possible to what the performer would
      choose to hear.While egoistic overpowering of the total sound should never
      occur, the exercise of virtuosity is strongly encouraged when it is carried
      out with as much consciousness as possible to the total situation. Performers
      should always try to be both inventive and sensitive. As in all my other
      simultaneities, the most important "rules" are: "<I>Listen</I>" and
      "<I>Relate</I>."</FONT>

The notion of language speaking <I>through </I>Mac Low may seem at odds with
his own attempts to efface the subject from the composition process; but
as Mac Low admits, no process, however aleatory, obliterates the choosing,
shaping ego of the poet.

The point is that when we take a step back and allow for a greater impingement
of the external&#151;when we no longer foreground expression or description
as the <I>raison d'etre</I> of poetry&#151;then we are able to see the language
around us from different angles. Found language is no longer harnessed solely
to the exigencies of "the message." Which doesn't mean that meaning is no
longer important. Quite the contrary: what Mac Low foregrounds is the very
machinery of meaning-production, the role of context in the coloring (delimiting)
of words. D.T.Suzuki: "The great fault with us all is that we force logic
on facts whereas it is facts themselves that create logic" ("The Zen Doctrine
of No-Mind" 224).
<P>
Environment is never neutral (no pure dharma). It is always at the service
of (or perhaps more exactly, a function of) a particular context. The
beauty&#151;and ultimately the political power&#151;of Mac Low's project
is the recognition of the possibility of alternative contexts. The present
hegemonic form of organization is only one possible context among others.
There is always the possibility of the redistribution of the materials at
hand.

    <TD><FONT COLOR="Navy">The state of no-mind-ness refers to the time prior
      to the separation of mind and world, when there is yet no mind standing against
      an external world and receiving its impressions through various sense-channels.
      Not only a mind, but a world, has not yet&nbsp;come into existence. This
      we&nbsp;can say is a state of pure emptiness, but as long as we stay here
      there is&nbsp;no development, no experience, it is mere doing-nothing,
      it&nbsp;is death itself, so to&nbsp;speak. But we are not so constituted.
      There rises a thought in the midst of the Emptiness; this is the awakening
      of Prajna, the separation of unconsciousness and consciousness, or, logically
      stated, the rise of the fundamental dialectical antithesis. . .&nbsp;. The
      Unconscious and the world of consciousness are in direct oppositionn, yet
      they lie back to back and&nbsp;condition each other. The one negates the
      other, but this negation is really affirmation.</FONT>

On the one hand, the dictrine of No-mind could lead to
passivity&#151;"<FONT COLOR="Navy">When sitting, just sit</FONT>." While
we perhaps secretly take pride in our striving for no-mind, the walls come
a-tumbling down. A perfect emptiness: no development, no experience, death
itself. But on the other hand "<FONT COLOR="Navy">the original Mind is neither
dependent upon nor independent of</FONT>" the external world. The striving
for no-mind can also be seen as a stance of nonaggression towards, equivalence

    <TD><FONT COLOR="Navy">Prajna, which is the awakening of consciousness in
      the Unconscious, functions in a twofold direction. The one is towards the
      Unconscious and the other toward the conscious. The Prajna which is oriented
      to the Unconscious is Prajna properly so called, while the Prajna of
      consciousness is now called mind with small initial letter. From this mind
      a dualistic world takes its rise: subject and object, the inner self andthe
      external world, and so on. In the Mind, therefore, two aspects are also
      indistinguishable: Prajna-mind of non-discrimination and dualistic mind.
      The mind of the first aspect belongs to this world, but so long as it is
      linked with Prajna it is in direct communication with the Unconscious, it
      is the&nbsp;Mind; whereas the mind of the second aspect is wholly of this
      world and delighted with it, and mixes itself with all its
      multiplicities.</FONT>

A dualistic world: the grounds for descrimination and exclusion. The
subject/object couplet leads rather rapidly to others, such as us/them,
friend/enemy, superior/inferior, natural/unnatural. The goal, then, is
Prajna-mind of non-descrimination.
