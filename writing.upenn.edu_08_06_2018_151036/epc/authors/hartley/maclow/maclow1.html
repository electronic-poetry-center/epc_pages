What are we to <I>do </I>with the seemingly-fragmented works of Jackson Mac
Low? Another way to put this question is, "How are we to read these works?"
Or "What do these poems offer us besides the momentary euphoria and/or irritating
groundlessness we experience in the act of reading such work?" Perhaps simply
the fact that Mac Low's project raises such questions about poetry and meaning
is sufficient to qualify it as one of the most important achievements in
the arts (&amp; beyond) in the latter half of the century. But there is more.
<P>
Mac Low as performance artist: inherent in the notion of performance is action.
What Mac Low presents us with is a model for acting in a world which
paradoxically presents itself as both fragmented (without connections) and
totalitarian (all-too connected). He urges a sensitivity to our surroundings
that, when taken seriously, forces us into a deeper appreciation of our present
and potential impact (both positive and negative) on the world (human and
otherwise) around us. As Jerome Rothenberg suggests in his preface to Mac
Low's <I>Representative Works: 1938-1985</I>, we should approach his books
"not only as a text but as a score &amp; manual."
<P>
In the series "Words nd Ends from Ez," for instance, we face Mac Low's work
at perhaps its most fragmented. What he has done is to select words and fragments
from Ezra Pound's <I>The Cantos </I>in order to create a diastic "reading"
of Pound's work. Mac Low spells out the name EZRA POUND by searching through
the text for words containing the necessary letters. The first "E" he comes
to becomes the start of the poem, whether that letter begins a word or appears
in the middle (whence the fragments). He then searches for the next "Z" and
takes along with it the previous letter in order to have "Z" take its place
diastically as the second letter in the second "word." The next "R" carries
along the two letters preceding it, "A" the preceding three. Then the process
begins again with the next "P" as the first letter, etc., etc.

But again: what are we to do with fragments such as "yZance"? One possibility:

    <TD><FONT COLOR="Navy">When I began aleatoric verbal composition, I thought
      of the works as being "concrete" (I usually resented the application of the
      term "abstract" to them). . . . The very fact that these works are composed
      of language elements that have intrinsic references precludes their being
      completely empty. Even disjunct or collage phonemes remind us of words in
      which they may occur. Similarly, words and phrases inevitably lead the
      perceiver's mind to possible sentences in which they might be occuring, and
      sentences at least <I>connote</I> larger discourses.</FONT>

There is meaning in even the smallest unit because each unit suggests a larger
enveloping context. Nothing occurs in isolation. Consequently, even though
Mac Low produces his works through aleatoric means, with no particular meaning
in mind, the result is thoroughly&#151;inevitably&#151;meaningful.
