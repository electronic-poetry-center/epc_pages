    <TD><FONT COLOR="Navy">We feel that if we read the radically disjunct poems
      often enough we will begin to feel, if not define, an underlying meaning
      connecting the disjecta membra. But contrariwise, we may sometimes suspect
      that the connections and meanings we sense may be our own projections, and
      that even the poems that seem to be intimate personal statements may really
      be at least as disjunctive semantically as they are rhetorically.</FONT>

      <FONT COLOR="Navy">The very vagueness so characteristic of the Chinese style
      of writing is in fact its strength: mere points of reference are given, and
      as how to connect them, to yield a meaning, the knowledge and feeling of
      the reader are the real determinant.</FONT>

Democracy in action: the reader as co-creator of meaning. No mere passivity
as the author totally encodes the reader's experience of the text. There's
also the implication here that even in the most tightly controlled work the
reader still has a hand in the final outcome, although that usually remains
a mere potentiality rather than a realization of the constructive powers
of the reader. "When sitting, just sit"? Mac Low seems to be searching for
an action-Zen, not simply a mode of contemplation; the reader must
<I>respond</I> to the phenomena she perceives. Here's an activist use of
the notion of "reader response"&#151;the reader must be response-able.
<P>
As I suggested earlier, environment is never neutral; it is always already
coded. Mac Low exhorts us to take a hand in that organization, to recreate
our own environment by listening, relating, and responding. The reader/performer
creates a provisional whole out of the dispirate elements around them. (For
a justification of this pronoun usage, see "The 'THEY' Manifesto" in The
Pronouns, page 76.; another example of Mac Low's desire to reorganize our
perceptions for a more democratic outcome.)

    <TD><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="36"></TD>
    <TD><FONT COLOR="Navy">Schematically, this "whole" can be represented by
      concentric spheres: the inmost is that of the individual performer; next,
      that of the whole performance group; next, that of the larger social group,
      including audience as well as performers; next, that of the performance space,
      including room acoustics, electronics, etc.; and finally, the larger spaces
      within which the performance space is situated: the rest of the building,
      the surrounding streets, neighborhood, city (or rural area), etc., all of
      which may affect significantly the aggregate of sounds heard by each individual
      at each moment. The spheres are best conceived as transparent and
      interpenetrating&#151;not as static shells but concentric ripples travelling
      simultaneously out from and in toward each center.</FONT>

Subsequent readings of the "same" work will in fact be the readings of different
works, the score (the text) of each work being realized in different ways,
in different contexts (different concentric spheres). A reading of a particular
work in New York City will be a different work than that which is read in
Albuquerque. The poem is an utterly social construct which we may choose
to reconstruct in various ways to suit varying purposes.
<P>
But how, specifically, may a reader reconstruct works which on first sight
seem totally meaningless? How is meaning to be realized? Mac Low gives the
following advice:
<P>
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="36" BORDER="0"></TD>
    <TD><FONT COLOR="Navy">Performers should understand the syntax of each sentence
      and speak it in such a way as to make the syntactical relations between its
      component words clear. To do this they will sometimes have to solve word-class
      ambiguity problems, that is, decide to which of two or more possible parts
      of speech (noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) particular words in a sentence
      must belong in order for the sentence to cohere structurally, even when the
      sentence is (at least existentially) absurd. All sentences longer than single
      words or short phrases must be assumed to form structurally complete statements,
      questions, or requests. Each sentence should be spoken with the inflections
      appropriate to its meaning and sentence type and with one of the sentence-final
      intonation contours appropriate to its end mark.</FONT>

Thus Mac Low sees his work, as well as much by some so-called "Language Poets,"
as perceiver-centered. Meaning is an effect of the reading/performance process.
