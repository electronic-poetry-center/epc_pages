                hurry. Oh, he's telling me a joke about our common inability to 
                occupy two planes. What he can't know is that I hate body language. 
                &quot;My life had stood, a little speech, a clipped coupon.&quot;<br>
                Hell is unredeemed experience?</font></p>

                pencil and paper to jot down passing thoughts? Not likely. I, 
                myself, was always a forwarding address.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">But here's the joke: syntactic space predates 
                and dominates these words.</font></p>

                must go to the doctor because she was bleeding<br>
                down there,. She didn't look alarmed, but suppressed<br>
                a smile, as if she were "tickled," as if she were<br>
                going to get away with something.</font>
              <p> <font size="3">"Look," said the doctor, "you are confusing<br>
                infraction with profusion. Despite<br>
                may be divided into two<br>
                equal segments: Exceptional and Spiteful."</font>
