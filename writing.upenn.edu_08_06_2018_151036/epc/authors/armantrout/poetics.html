          <p><br>
            My statement of poetics is going to be a personal narrative of sorts. 
            I spent my twenties in the Bay Area - at one of the origin points 
            for what came to be known as &quot;language poetry&quot; and I am, 
            as you may know, one of the people associated with that group. But 
            when I've said that, what have I said really? That group is as varied, 
            as diverse as any poetic school you can think of. So I want to look 
            farther back - at what first drew me to poetry. When I was a teenager, 
            I was given an anthology and the poets I most loved there were William 
            Carlos Williams and Emily Dickinson. So I was drawn to poems that 
            seemed as if they were either going to vanish or explode - to extremes, 
            in other words, radical poetries. But how do we define &quot;radical?&quot; 
            Perhaps by how much is put at risk in the text, how far the arc of 
            implication can reach and still seem apt. But so much rides, as always, 
            on that word &quot;seems.&quot; Is a writing radical when it risks 
            being wrong, when it acknowledges our wrongness? I think my poetry 
            involves an equal counter-weight of assertion and doubt. It's a Cheshire 
            poetics, one that points two ways then vanishes in the blur of what 
            is seen and what is seeing, what can be known and what it is to know. 
            That double-bind. But where was I? <br>
          </p>
          <p>I was saying that I discovered Williams (and the other Imagists) 
            early on and was very much moved by them. By what though? I would 
            say now it was by their attempt to make the object speak, to put things 
            in dialogue with mind and somehow make them hold up their end of the 
            conversation. This is both an important project and a doomed one. 
            The world enters the poem only through a kind of ventriloquy. Thing 
            and idea don't really merge, as the poets themselves knew. Williams' 
            red wheelbarrow is essentially separate from the &quot;so much&quot; 
            that depends upon it. But there is so much poignancy in that gap! 
            It is as if the Imagist poet wants to spin around suddenly and catch 
            the world unaware, in dishevelment, see it as it is when we're not 
            looking. And how can we not want that?<br>
          </p>
          <p>One of my favorite Williams' poems is &quot;The Attic Which Is Desire.&quot; 
            This poem does an amazing balancing act; it is simultaneously a realist 
            depiction of an urban scene and an apotheosis of projected desire. 
            I encountered it when I was quite young and discovering sexuality. 
            I understood the poem's narrow, vaginal column of text, transfixed 
            by the ejaculatory soda, as an amazing embodiment. I loved the way 
            the poem was both about orgasm and about seeing the lights of a sign 
            reflected in a dark window. In other words, I liked its doubleness. 
            That's not a term usually associated with Imagism, perhaps. As Bob 
            Perelman has pointed out, Pound praised H.D.'s writing by saying it 
            was &quot;straight as the Greek&quot; and with no &quot;slither.&quot;It 
            took me awhile to see the gynophobia behind such rhetoric. I wanted 
            my Imagism and my slither too. My precision and my doubleness.<br>
          </p>
          <p>My earliest published poems were minimalist and neo-Imagist. A good 
            example would be &quot;View,&quot; a poem from my first book, Extremities. 
            Looking back on it now, I see in &quot;View&quot; an exacerbated form 
            of the doubleness which interested me in Williams' &quot;Attic.&quot; 
            &quot;View&quot; has not only two meanings, but two dissonant meanings. 
            On the one hand, &quot;we&quot; (an already suspect first person plural) 
            want to see the moon as separate from our own activity (a bit of the 
            world caught unawares). On the other hand, our yearning is framed 
            by deflating cliches. To want the moon is to want the impossible. 
            Our thrust toward the non-human moon can't escape the gravity of received 
            language. The purportedly single voice of the nature lover and the 
            words of a somewhat cynical crowd seem to collide. So this is a poetics 
            of collisions and overlaps, contested spaces. The border of the public 
            and private is just such a contested space. To use dream imagery in 
            a poem, for instance, is to expose something private, but what if 
            a recent film inspired the dream? As I have become increasingly conscious 
            of such contested spaces and the voices that articulate them, my poems 
            have become somewhat longer and more complicated.<br>
          </p>
          <p>The concept of voice has long been associated with poetry. We all 
            hear voices, on the radio, in the newspaper, in memory. As Whitman 
            says, &quot;I contain multitudes.&quot; As Satan says, &quot;My name 
            is legion.&quot; Various voices speak in my poems. I code shift. I 
            am many things: a white person, a working class person with roots 
            in the South, a woman, an academic of sorts, a 60's person who still 
            likes rock and roll, someone who was raised on the Bible, a skeptic, 
            etc. My voices manifest their own social unrest. In the last decade 
            or so, academics have been raising the question of who speaks in literary 
            works, who speaks and for whom. There is a contemporary poetry which 
            enacts these same questions, a poetics of the cross-roads.<br>
            As I looked over my poems, trying to extract a &quot;poetics&quot; 
            for this talk, I noticed how often my poems parody and undermine some 
            voice of social control. My poem, &quot;A Story&quot; (from Made To 
            Seem) might be an example of that. In &quot;A Story&quot; the characters 
            of the Good Mother and the Doctor try to keep things in their proper 
            places. They want pleasure postponed, categories upheld. The Child 
            who pinches her nipples and the Stubborn Old Woman who thinks a name 
            is a fiction are skeptics and dissidents. There is a way in which 
            I am all of these characters - the doctor and the mother as well as 
            the rebellious old woman and the child. These power struggles begin 
            in the public sphere and are reenacted in private. The mother is charged 
            with reproducing the social (linguistic) body within the single body 
            of the child. (Clearly, gender has a lot to do with the power struggles 
            in my poems. Increasingly so, perhaps.) <br>
          </p>
          <p>Would Pound have seen such confusion as a kind of distasteful &quot;slither?&quot; 
            Then let me appropriate an ally by invoking a Dickinson poem I love, 
            the one commonly known as &quot;A Narrow Fellow In The Grass.&quot; 
            Pound called for &quot;direct treatment of the thing&quot; and Narrow 
            Fellow certainly isn't that. Dickinson never identifies what she's 
            seen as a snake. She first personifies it, rather comically, as a 
            fellow. (Note the mock casualness, the mock intimacy there. Dickinson 
            is mistress/master of sinister humor.) The snake is then Him, capitalized 
            like God. Subsequently it appears as a comb, a rather phallic shaft 
            and a whiplash. It is gendered male - but then so is Dickinson - she 
            presents herself as a boy. So the gender dynamic is complex. There 
            is more going on than a virginal fear of penetration. The last two 
            lines evoke vividly the fear the snake arouses - but I would argue 
            that, like Satan in Paradise Lost, the snake is the real hero of the 
            poem. Dickinson's persona, the barefoot boy, is just too cordial with 
            &quot;Nature's People.&quot; There's something almost Norman Rockwell-esque 
            about this boy, reaching to &quot;secure&quot; whatever he sees. He 
            deserves the unsecurable, eerie snake who &quot;occasionally rides.&quot; 
            Dickinson, I would argue, is at least as much the snake as the boy. 
            Her poems reveal the fissures in identity and ideology.<br>
          </p>
          <p>And now back to me. There's no good segue back from Dickinson. But, 
            in their own way, I think, my poems enact such fissures. They are 
            composed of conflicting voices. Formally, too, they are often disjunctive. 
            The relation between stanza and stanza or section and section is often 
            oblique, multiple or partial. This isn't an accident. It's a way to 
            explore the relation of part to whole. This relation is a vexed one. 
            Does the part represent the whole? Is metaphor fair to the matter 
            it represents/ Does representative democracy work? I think of my poetry 
            as inherently political. (though it is not a poetry of opinion). In 
            an optimistic mood, one might see the multiple, optional relations 
            of parts in such work as a kind of anarchic cooperation. <br>
            Finally, poetry, at least the poetry I value, can reproduce our conflicts 
            and fractures and yet be held together in the ghost embrace of assonance 
            and consonance, in the echoed and echoing body of language. <br>
