<p>Meadows&rsquo; note on Itinerant Men (Krupskaya Press, 2004): </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the 19 th century is a contradiction of free social experiment and slavery, revolution and charisma, rational enquiry and racist construction, what happens when whalemen repress the impulse to mutiny?</p>
<p>This long portion from Deborah Meadows&rsquo; serial poem &ldquo;The Theory of Subjectivity in <em>Moby-Dick,</em>&rdquo; <strong><em>Itinerant Men</em></strong> is a reading-through of Melville's novel combining chance operation and philosophical investigations.</p>
<p>In an early chapter, Melville&rsquo;s Father Mapple re-told the story of Jonah as a problem of 19 th century sovereignty: &ldquo;&hellip; And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now &ldquo;under weigh,&rdquo; are <strong><em>Itinerant Men</em></strong> free to recast self and world by rejecting bogus authority? When has &ldquo;self&rdquo; ever been the reliable stick-and-stone at the barricades?</p>
<p>Or, might a negated self, the &ldquo;writer&rdquo; portray &ldquo;this new instance/ whether errors of an eye,/ man glowing with the remains of an ideal&rdquo; that is &ldquo;not as fearful as the dignity of divine/ or spiritual terror/ not as tragic as the undoing of goodness/ in our Starbuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, in line with Rabelais, can <em>excess</em> counteract the pull of compelling language that inspires one to ends greater than the dollar? Is value a scale under erasure? Language a cobbled beast?</p>
