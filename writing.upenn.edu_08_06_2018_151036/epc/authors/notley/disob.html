For a long time I've seen my job as bound up with the necessity of
noncompliance with pressures, dictates, atmospheres of, variously, poetic
factions, society at large, my own past practices as well. For a long
time--well in fact since the beginning, since I learned how to be a poet
inside the more rebellious wing of poetry; though learning itself meant a
kind of disobedience, so like most words the Dis word, the Dis form,
cannot be worshipped either--and that would be an obedience anyway. I've
spoken in other places of the problems, too, of subjects that hadn't been
broached much in poetry and of how it seemed one had to disobey the past
and the practices of literary males in order to talk about what was going
on most literarily around one, the pregnant body, and babies for example.
There were no babies in poetry then. How could that have been? What are we
leaving out now? Usually what's exactly in front of the eyes ears nose and
mouth, in front of the mind, but it seems as if one must disobey everyone
else in order to see at all. This is a persistent feeling in a poet but
staying alert to all the ways one is coerced into denying experience,
sense and reason is a huge task. I recently completed a very long poem
called <i>Disobedience</i> but I didn't realize that disobeying was what I
was doing, what perhaps I'd always been doing until the beginning of the
end of it, though the tone throughout was one of rejection of everything I
was supposed to be or to affirm, <i>all</i> the poetries all the groups
the
clothes the gangs the governments the feelings and reasons.<p>

I seem to start with my poem <i>The Descent of Alette</i> these days,
whatever it is that I am now seems to start there. It was for me an
immense act of rebellion against dominant social forces, against the
fragmented forms of modern poetry, against the way a poem was supposed to
look according to both past and contemporary practice. It begins in pieces
and ends whole, narrated by an I who doesn't know her name and whose name
when she finds it means appendage of a male name; her important name is I.
I stand with this, and with the urgency that saying I creates, a facing up
to sheer presence, death and responsibility, the potential for blowing
away all the gauze. In two subsequent narrative poem/proses, <i>Close to
me...& Closer (The Language of Heaven)</i> and
<i>D&eacute;sam&egrave;re</i> I felt
myself pushing
against ideas of reality as solely what's visible and in what shapes and
colors it's said to be visible, against the idea that religion is solely
an organized affair, against the pervasive idea that one must not protest
what everyone else has named the Actual--how can you fight
Reality?--against the psychology of belonging, of aiding and abetting.
<i>D&eacute;sam&egrave;re</i> especially is about not wanting to belong
and the process
of
ceasing to belong to the extent that's possible. All three of those works
are characterized by emphatic though variable metrical patterns, in the
prose as well as the poetry parts; two are very quirky as to physical
presentation; all three have narratives that tend to the fabular.<p>

	In a book that will soon be published, <i>Mysteries Of Small
Houses</i>,
I was firstly trying to realize the first person singular as fully and
nakedly as possible, saying "I" in such a way as to make myself really
nervous, really blowing away the gauze and making myself too scared of
life and death to care what anyone thought of me or what I was going to
say. Saying I in that way I tried to trace I's path through my past. In a
more subsidiary way I decided to go against my own sense that certain
styles and forms I'd participated in formerly might be used up, that
autobiography was, that the personal-sounding I (as opposed to the
fictional I) might be, against the rumor that there's no self, though I've
never understood that word very well and how people use it now in any of
the camps that use it pro or con--I guess I partly wrote <i>Mysteries</i> 
in
order to understand it better. I came to the conclusion, in the final poem
of the book, that self means 'I' and also means 'poverty,' it's what one
strips down to, who you are when you've stripped down.<p>
	It's possible that my biggest act of disobedience has
consistently, since I was an adolescent, been against the idea that all
truth comes from books, really other people's books. I hate the fact that
whatever I say or write, someone reading or listening will try to find
something out of their reading I "sound like." 'You sound just like...,'
'you remind me of...,' 'have you read...?' I read all the time and I
often believe what I read while I'm reading it, especially if it's some
trashy story; intense involvement in theories as well as stories seems
difficult without temporary belief, but then it burns out. I've been
trying to train myself for thirty or forty years not to believe anything
anyone tells me. Not believing, then, became the crux of
<i>Disobedience</i>,
which is my most recent completed book. Not believing and telling the
truth as it comes up. One of the main elements in the poem is an ongoing
fantasy in which the I, who is pretty much I, keeps company and converses
with a man very much like the actor Robert Mitchum and that of course is
not strictly believable. On the other hand it's fun, and it stands for
something a sort of truth, about how we do have stories going on in our
consciousness and unconsciousness all the time and about how we're always
talking to some "you" mentally. I wouldn't expect you to take this book as
the truth, I would expect you to go with it, given that you like to read.
I find the act of reading puzzling at the moment, since in a book I've
been working on since <i>Disobedience</i> I ask the reader to read despite
the
fact that I'm not really entertaining the reader or being clear in any of
the traditional ways I can think of. I think books may imply a readership
that simply likes to read, which may sound obvious but it's something I
myself have only just thought of. But back to <i>Disobedience</i>. It asks
the
reader to read a lot of pages, about 230 A 4 pages in verse, but it's
fairly easy to read and it makes a lot of jokes. It's very feminist but
men seem to enjoy it a lot, it possibly contains a rather virile approach
to things riding roughshod and shooting at every little duck that seems to
pop up. As I implied earlier, <i>Disobedience</i> didn't exactly set out
to be
disobedient; it set out actually to try to do the kinds of things I'd
previously done in different poems all in the same poem, that is tell a
story, interact with the so-called visible or phenomenal the despised
daily, and explore the unconscious. But it got more and more pissed off as
it confronted the political from an international vantage, dealt with
being a woman in France, with turning fifty and being a poet and thus
seemingly despised or at least ignored. The title popped up in a dream I
had towards the end of writing the work, in connection with a comic poet I
know: it was the title of his book in the dream and I realized later that
there was probably nothing more disobedient than being a comic poet, since
no one's ever sure if that's good enough, particularly the academy unless
you've been dead since the 14th century or unless you've also written a
lot of tragedies. I myself wouldn't want the limitation of being only one
kind of poet, but I realize this comic business is something to think
about. But more and more as I wrote <i>Disobedience</i> I discovered I
couldn't
go along, with the government or governments, with radicals and certainly
not with conservatives or centrists, with radical poetics and certainly
not with other poetics, with other women's feminisms, with any fucking
thing at all; belonging to any of it was not only an infringement on my
liberty but a veil over clear thinking.<p>
	It's necessary to maintain a state of disobedience against...everything. One must remain somehow, though how, open to any subject or
form in principle, open to the possibility of liking, open to the
possibility of using. I try to maintain no continuous restrictions in my
poetics except with regard to particular works, since writing at all means
making some sort of choices. But NO DOCTRINES. Rather I tend to maintain a
sense that a particular form or set of rules at a certain point might
serve me for a while. Like many writers I feel ambivalent about words, I
know they don't work, I know they aren't it. I don't in the least feel
that everything is language. I have a sense that there has been language
from the beginning, that it isn't fundamentally an invention. These are
contradictory positions but positions are just words. I don't believe that
the best poems are just words, I think they're the same as reality; I tend
to think reality is poetry, and that it isn't words. But words are one way
to get at reality/poetry, what we're in all the time. I think words are
among us and everywhere else, mingling, fusing with, backing off from us
and everything else.<p>
	Since <i>Disobedience</i>, I've been working on this other thing
which
isn't as friendly as Dis is, though it isn't meant to be unfriendly. It's
just hard to read, in that you have to decide to sit down and read it word
by word giving each word the rhythm and weight it requires. That sounds
like poetry but this one tends to be in long blowy sentences all down the
page. I am going at several ideas at once: one is that the world is
intensely telepathic, infused with the past and continual thought of all
the living and all the dead. I started out with that idea and with the
idea of a Byzantine church as a sort of head, mine, full of icons and
mosaics on ever expanding and shifting walls. But the church or head got
bigger and bigger and more and more full of images and words until it
expanded into a city. So at the moment, on page one hundred and something,
I'm dealing with the idea that there are two cities or worlds at the same
time, an ideal crystalline one and the supposedly real one. Generally I'm
neither all the way in one nor the other, though sometimes it seems as if
I'm nowhere near the crystal one and its reasonable opulence so I start
beating hard at all the doors I can find in my mind. Then sometimes it
seems as if the supposedly real world just isn't there or here at all
though I know if I stop typing and go outside it will get me. This work is
also very disobedient, in a way it picks up where <i>Disobedience</i> left
off;
but it doesn't lecture as much or shake its fist so, is less interested in
the so-called real than in denying its existence in favor of the real
real.
You can't fly unless you're not on the ground and this one really flies
sometimes.<p>
	I think I conceive of myself as disobeying my readership a lot. I
began the new work in fact denying their existence; it seemed to me I
needed most at this point to work on my own existence so I couldn't afford
to cater to them if they got in the way of my finding out things. But
this is a work of mine, it should be published sometime. I'm now in a
predicament I can't get out of, a form I can't manage for the reader,
which just keeps leading me on and leading me on. It's predicated on
leaving in as much mind fuzz as possible, that is being open to all that
is out there in all telepathy--not a very organizable entity, the entity.
Too wordy too long; and I've allowed in a lot of notions from my dreams
again, have allowed odd images to take on the weight of truth; and I'm
stubbornly involved again in what you might call mystical conceptions, but
aren't those a nono? except in icky New Age territory, yuck. The reader
likes you to tell her/him what she/he already knows in a familiar form
whether in mainstreamese or avant-gardese, but then there is the
individual reader who is often not like that at all, who prefers poems to
talking about them and has strange individual experiences with them.
That's a very scary idea. It's possible that the reader, or maybe the
ideal reader, is a very disobedient person a head/church/city entity
her/himself full of soaring icons and the words of all the living and all
the dead, who sees and listens to it all and never lets on that there's
all this beautiful almost undifferentiation inside, everything equal and
almost undemarcated in the light of fundamental justice. And poker-faced
puts up with the outer forms. As I do a lot of the time but not so much
when I'm writing.<p>
