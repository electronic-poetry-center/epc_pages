	<dd>What else might I repeat to make my
point about these three writings?  We have been taught, repeatedly,
to avoid repetition.  &quot;I merely said,&quot; Derrida says,
&quot;and then repeated: genres are not to be mixed; I will not
mix them&quot; (202).  But neither Perelman nor Harryman repeats
this.  Perelman hasn't really begun at the beginning of <U>Vice</U>,
I have left out his repetition of the lines that follow this citation
in <U>Vice</U>, and Harryman has not, exactly, repeated Derrida.
<P>
<dd> Allow me to reiterate:
<P>
<dd>  I have cited at length and shall continue to, so the reader
is now forewarned. I shall do so, first of all, because it gives
me pleasure that I would not like to miss, even though it may
be deemed perverse: a certain practice of citation, and also of
iteration . . . is at work, constantly <U>altering</U> at once
and without delay . . . whatever it seems to reproduce. . . .
Iteration alters, something new takes place.  (Derrida, <U>Limited</U>
40) 
<P>
 <dd>It was, of course, Gertrude Stein who first and most massively
instructed us in the pleasures of reiteration, but hers seems
a largely untheorized practice, despite the many compositions
on composition from her hand.  Recent years have witnessed a resurgence
of interest in the arts of reappropriation and re-citation, but
in these contemporary instances our poets' works may often be
read as interventions within the theorizing of poetics.  As Lyn
Hejinian has remarked:
<P><blockquote>
 <i> Where critics used to debate, as if it were a real thing, a
difference between form and content, so now they would separate
&quot;theory&quot; from &quot;practice,&quot; and thus divide
a poet from his or her own intentions and poetry from its motives.
But in fact poetic language might be precisely a thinking about
thinking, a form of introspection within the unarrested momentum
of experience, that makes the polarization of theory and practice
as irrelevant as that of form and content, mentality and physicality,
art and reality.</i></blockquote>
<P>
<dd>What Carla Harryman has done in her <U>Vice</U> is to take Jacques
Derrida at his word, a practice for which she has his prior permission,
in his own hand, for he has told his readers in &quot;Limited
Inc a b c . . .,&quot; &quot;you can take my word for it&quot;
(<U>Limited</U> 44).  In taking his words she has come to represent
what I take to be a somewhat altered view of citation, use, mention
and allusion which is developing among a number of our more interesting
contemporary poets, a view which differs from both the practices
of classic allusion and the more visible practice of appropriation
by artists such as Sherrie Levine; the new view is more akin to
the practice of digital sampling techniques among contemporary
recording artists, and shares with these techniques the questionable
legal status of all newly transgressive strategies.
<P>
 <dd>More traditional modes of allusion are still alive and well among
the most avant-garde of American writers, as is evidenced by these
lines from Ron Silliman's poem &quot;Oz&quot;:
<P>
<center>
             . . . a circus
<P>
  for the faint world, hurry
<P>
  up please it's time
<P>
  the echoes of your own war
<P>
  were heard in the poem.   (108)
</center>
<P>
<dd>Most educated readers would immediately recognize this echo of
one of America's best known twentieth century alluders, T. S.
Eliot, and might mark the fact that Silliman here alludes to what
may be Eliot's best known appropriation of vernacular speech.
 Most would also read in these lines a critique both of Eliot's
poetics and of the particular repertoire of New Critical reading
habits his texts further.
<P>
 <dd>But for many of our newer poets, Silliman among them, this sort
of critique of received reading practice couched in the allusive
terms of that practice was not enough.  Looking to the fluid origins
of the &quot;language movement,&quot; Bob Perelman recalls the
transgressive sensibility many of these poets developed in terms
which again challenge Eliotic terms of allusion:
<P>
 <dd> Exchange between audience and writer was fluid and constant:
<U>anything heard or read could be rewritten</U>; labels and fixed
genres held little attraction. Writing was not a revered tradition,
a set of monuments waiting to accommodate the next individual
talent, it was a social practice.  (&quot;Language&quot; 2, emphasis
added)
<P>
<dd>Many of Perelman's own works exhibit this radical rewriting, and
represent movement towards the technique of sampling seen in Harryman's
<U>Vice</U>.  Perelman's poem &quot;Hymn to Intellectual Beauty,&quot;
from his volume <U>Primer</U>, is a severe redaction of Percy
Shelley's poem of the same title.  Following the title on Perelman's
page we encounter the advisory phrase, &quot;<U>after Shelley</U>,&quot;
alerting us to the fact that like Pound's and Lowell's translations,
this is a post-Romantic reduction of Shelley's stanzas, a loose
translation for our contemporary use.  The phrase, &quot;after
Shelley,&quot; like the titles of Sherrie Levine's works &quot;After
Monet&quot; and &quot;After Walker Evans,&quot; indicates to readers
that the act of appropriation and alteration is in progress and
invites comparison to the &quot;original,&quot; a comparison which
takes a critical turn when we read in Perelman's slenderized stanza:
<center>
<P>
  I called the phonemes
<P>
  A thousand names. Speechless
<P>
  Thoughts answered each.
<P>
  But I kept my vow, in dark bondage.  (21)
</center>
<P>
<dd>Similarly, Ronald Johnson's long poem <U>RADI  OS</U>, which might
otherwise be read in intertextual innocence, bears along with
its text an apparatus to remind us that this poem is in fact a
perforated performance of <U>Paradise Lost</U>.  The inside front
cover of Johnson's work reproduces the first page of Milton's
poem and demonstrates the procedures by which most of Milton's
inscription was cancelled.  A prefatory note by Johnson and an
intriguing afterword by Guy Davenport again take up the relationships
between the texts of Milton and Johnson, quite publicly problematizing
the status of both authors.  <U>RADI  OS</U> carries with it on
all pages the ghost of Milton's texts, not only in the dismembered
remains of his words, but almost as importantly in the spectral
spacings where the rest of <U>Paradise Lost</U> used to lodge.
<P>
<dd> But this type of apparatus is largely missing from <U>Vice</U>,
and Carla Harryman, in subsuming the bibliographical context of
her opening, makes it clear that she is not in fact citing, using,
or mentioning Derrida.  She is rather, as Rod Smith suggests in
the surprised ending of his review of <U>Vice</U>, &quot;Tak[ing]
up the `suppose'&quot; (126) offered by Derrida immediately after
the lines Harryman has taken up for her work's opening gesture:
<P>
  <dd>Now suppose I let these utterances resonate all by   themselves.
<P>
 <dd> Suppose: I abandon them to their fate, I set free their random
virtualities and turn them over to my audience--or rather to <U>your</U>
audience, to your auditory grasp, to whatever mobility they retain
and you bestow upon them to engender effects of all kinds without
my having to stand behind them.  (&quot;Law&quot; 202)
<P>
<dd> Harryman does observe the laws of proper citation on page fifty-two
of <U>Vice</U> when she correctly identifies the paragraph she
quotes from Max Beckman's exhibition catalog for the Los Angeles
County Museum; she follows this law on page fifty-two so that
she can <U>refer</U> to her citation again on page fifty-five,
where she writes: &quot;What I am thinking about now is my attempt
to abuse the Max Beckman catalog copy.  The relationship it forms
with my other writing is too obvious.&quot;  When these passages
are placed alongside the Derrida derivation, the abuse of allusion
and citation becomes increasingly less obvious and more interesting.
<P>
<dd> It has long been a puzzle to me that critical discussions of
intertextuality and allusion seldom cross paths with discussions
of the death of the referent, or of the referent's near relative,
the author.  Harryman's text is a site where these discussions
do meet, and where they cross the debate between Jacques Derrida
and John Searle over the corpse of J. L. Austin's philosophical
performance of the parasitical nature of fictive speech.  On page
fifty-two of <U>Vice</U> Harryman cites Beckman.  On page fifty-five
she refers to that citation, and any reader can easily check up
on the health of that referent.  Less easy to diagnose is the
case of Derrida's sample as it works its way through these texts.
<P>
<dd> In Bob Perelman's essay &quot;Language Writing and Audience,&quot;
he clearly cites Harryman's <U>Vice</U>, and his argument refers
back to that citation.  And yet those readers who meet at the
intersection of the published texts of Carla Harryman, the as
yet uncollected speeches of Jacques Derrida, and the addresses
at the Modern Language Association of Bob Perelman (a readership
which my investigations indicate is composed of exactly seven
people) will immediately perceive a number of transgressions which
invite inquiry.  As previously noted, Perelman, in quoting, alters
Harryman's lineation of the passage in which she has altered the
lineation of Derrida's &quot;original.&quot;  Further, despite
what he says, Perelman is not strictly citing the &quot;beginning&quot;
of <U>Vice</U>.  The passage he cites is one of three or four
opening gestures which precede a page headed &quot;Part I.&quot;

<dd> Page one of <U>Vice</U> consists of a short text, dedicated to
Larry Ochs, which delivers a preliminary consideration of the
status of audiences and authors.  Page two, which is counted but
not numbered, is a blank page which counts for something as it
separates these openings.  Page three contains a two line text
and the title of <U>Vice</U>, and it is not till we reach the
fourth page of the book that we read the Derridean text which
Perelman's essay identifies as the &quot;beginning of <U>Vice</U>.&quot;
 But perhaps he is right.  Perhaps this <U>is</U> where the writing
and reciting of <U>Vice</U> has its beginning.
<P>
<dd> Harryman could not have expected many to recognize the statement
she has altered from Derrida's &quot;The Law of Genre.&quot; 
It first appeared in English in this country in the journal <U>Glyph</U>
in 1980, was subsequently reprinted in the same year as part of
a collection of essays <U>On Narrative</U> edited by W. J. T.
Mitchell, and has yet to appear in a volume of works by its author.
<dd> The status of Derrida's text is further unsettled by the avowal
of its translator, Avital Ronell, that this published text &quot;was
originally intended solely for oral delivery&quot; (229) at the
1979 International Colloquium on Genre at the University of Strasbourg.
 What we encounter near the beginning of <U>Vice</U>, then, is
an altered version of the opening lines of a translation originally
intended only for oral delivery to an international, but small,
audience of careful readers.
<P>
<dd> The orality of this professed intention is crucial here because
it is at the nexus of Harryman's poetic intervention in the debate
among Derrida, Searle, and the dead author J. L. Austin.  The
opening of Derrida's speech is a classic example of what Austin
called performative utterance.  Derrida cites the law of genre,
promises to obey it, and then repeats or re-cites himself.  Austin
argues that performative utterances of the type &quot;I will not
mix genres&quot; will be &quot;` <U>in a peculiar way</U> hollow
or void if said by an actor on the stage, or if introduced in
a poem . . .'&quot; (qtd. in Derrida, <U>Limited</U> 16).  Thus,
according to Austin, Perelman's citation of such a promise in
his MLA paper is a performative void.  We do not take it as infelicitous
when we discover that Perelman has broken the promise and does
indeed mix genres, as we didn't take him to be really making such
a promise in the first place; he is &quot;merely&quot; citing
Harryman, who seems to be citing Derrida.  But when Derrida repeats
himself, is he making the promise again, is he citing himself,
and thus voiding the promise, or is he indicating that the promise
is an ironic remark not to be taken as a performative?  When his
promise is introduced into a poem by Carla Harryman without attribution,
is she making the same promise, citing his promise, or, as John
Searle might describe it, creating a parasitic discourse in which
Derrida's promise is being used, not mentioned.  But what use
is it?  We might well ask, as Derrida asks of a reprinted signature:
&quot;Why would anyone repeat this gesture and what would such
repetition signify?&quot; (<U>Limited</U> 20)
<P>
<dd> One thing it signifies is Harryman's participation in the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
poets' continuing critique of poetic &quot;voice&quot; and the
author function.  Encountering a phrase we recognize, but which
is not being cited properly and which might have difficulty functioning
as an allusion in the traditional sense, we are tempted to ask
who is speaking.  Yet in <U>Vice</U> we read that &quot;The author
is discarded.  . . . Nothing is gratuitous.  I am to blame&quot;
(37).  If I am to blame, though, who or what am &quot;I&quot;?
<P>
 <dd> I am an indication of what occurs around me. For instance, some
snakes occur in forests, whereas others occur at the zoo. This
is something zoos will not confess, for when you read the labels,
snakes occur someplace other than in their cages.  (Harryman,
<U>Animal</U> 108)
<P>
<dd>Elsewhere Harryman has said: &quot;I have no identity.  I have
learned to fabricate an identity by imitating someone else&quot;
(&quot;Middle&quot; 144).  In turn, this somewhat impersonal pronoun
seems to be the same one that cites itself at the close of Derrida's
&quot;The Law of Genre&quot;:
<P>
 <dd> There, that is the whole of it, it is only what &quot;I,&quot;
so they say, here kneeling at the edge of literature, can see.
In sum, the law. The law summoning: what &quot;I&quot; can sight
and what &quot;I&quot; can say that I sight in this site of a
recitation where I/we is.   (229)
<P>
<dd>Such ceaseless proliferation of the personal pronoun within the
context of a discussion of appropriation and reiteration seemingly
wreaks havoc with the Austinian conception of the voided performance.
 It <U>is</U> possible for two actors to recite marriage vows
on a television show and really mean it, and for the state, that
ultimate arbiter of recitation, to recognize the intentional status
of their performative utterance by recognizing their marriage;
we have seen this on several occasions since the marriage of Tiny
Tim and Miss Vicky on the <U>Tonight Show</U> and the wonder is
that actors aren't accidentally married even more often than they
are.  Such a marriage is no less an entertainment and fictive
commodity for all the felicity of its discursive practice.  Conversely,
most of Derrida's auditors at the International Colloquium on
Genre, given his reputation for irony, probably assumed as he
made his promise not to mix genres that he didn't really mean
it.  These examples are evidence of what Derrida calls a general
citationality or iterability which is the prerequisite for felicitous
performatives.  The possibility of infelicitous performance is
seen by Derrida as the principle upon which our promising future
is predicated.  The peculiarity of the voiding of performative
utterance outlined by Austin is the fact that such a repeatable
void constitutes the possibility of promissory speech, and the
promise of writing.  In &quot;Signature Event Context,&quot; Derrida
proposes, indeed insists upon:
<P>
 <dd> . . . the possibility of disengagement and citational graft
which belongs to the structure of every mark, spoken or written,
and which constitutes every mark in writing before and outside
of every horizon of semio-linguistic communication; in writing,
which is to say in the possibility of its functioning being cut
off, at a certain point, from its &quot;original&quot; desire-to-say-what-one-means
and from its participation in a saturable and constraining context.
Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in
the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit,
can be <U>cited</U>, put between quotation marks; in so doing
it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity
of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. 
This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context,
but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center
or absolute anchorage.  This citationality, this duplication or
duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident
nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark
could not even have a function called &quot;normal.&quot; What
would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins
would not get lost along the way?   (<U>Limited</U> 12)
<P>
<dd> In the process of digital sampling discrete segments of sound
are inscribed as data and stored for later retrieval.  They may
be played back at any pitch, given any conceivable timbre, duration,
attack.  As Bob Perelman felt in the early days of his community
of writers, &quot;anything heard or read could be rewritten&quot;
within a new context which somehow bore the traces of the old
along with it.  As Derrida describes the same moment of supplementarity
and duplicity, &quot;everything becomes possible against the language-police&quot;
(<U>Limited</U> 100).  The reappearance of Derrida's ironic declaration
of an intention to obey the genre police in Carla Harryman's words
in <U>Vice</U> is like the sampled rhythm segment which is looped
and altered to form the base line of improvisation in contemporary
music.  It is a sample which rests upon a voided page, which may
be unrecognizable to its listeners, which may resist its own reiteration.
 Later in the book Harryman writes:
<P>
 <dd> The discrete forms (the fragments, pieces of partially invented
genres) of those things I write refer to their own various points
of origin. A point of origin might be where many of the same kinds
of fragments exit simultaneously.  Origin is not synonymous with
any specific representation.  All that is written becomes involved
with a process of production. In order to become parts of the
work, the discrete parts must to some extent yield their autonomous
identity. Sometimes they don't yield.  (54)
<P>
<dd>The passage I have cited at some length bears a partial explanation
of the curious status of the Derrida/Harryman text in what reads
as a felicitous typo: &quot;fragments exit simultaneously.&quot;
 The traces of the Derridean fragment exist in different states
in the texts of Derrida, Harryman and Perelman, seemingly always
seen in the act of disappearing through a side exit, a communicating
passage which allows citational characters to appear on several
stages at once.  In the essay &quot;Signature Event Context&quot;
Derrida describes how &quot;even a provisional recourse to ordinary
language and to the equivocations of natural language instructs
us that one can, for instance, <U>communicate a movement</U> or
that a tremor, a shock, a displacement of force can be communicated--that
is propagated, transmitted.  We also speak of different or remote
places communicating with each other by means of a passage or
opening&quot; (<U>Limited</U> 1).  Such a passage work describes
the reiterable sampling evident in Harryman and other contemporary
poets.  It is, as Harryman has it in <U>Animal Instincts</U>,
&quot;A structure for writing that comes from anticipation relative
to an elsewhere, which to become a somewhere--i.e. a writing--must
borrow from the things of this world in their partiality&quot;
(110).  That Harryman is partial to the pleasures afforded by
such reembedded borrowing accounts in part for the sense we get
in reading her texts that they are filled with exits as well as
exit lines, that they provide innumerable communicating passages
to other texts which exist simultaneously.
<P>
<dd> John Searle might have it that Harryman's <U>Vice</U> is a parasitic
discourse upon a host, the body of Derrida's texts, which have
for their part somewhat willfully performed a misprision of the
intentions of J. L. Austin.  But this might as easily be read
as a case of willing contagion.  In an unprotected sampling of
Derridean data, Harryman's text has picked up a string, a virus,
which is now resident within the corpus of her works.  Perelman
has contracted it from close contact.  Like a computer virus,
a sampled string of data which is, let us remember, a text, this
textual virus replicates rapidly, and often beyond notice.  In
the realm of Carla Harryman's <U>Vice</U>, a world in which anything
can be sampled and rewritten, a world in which everything becomes
possible against the language-police, there is no safe passage;
there is no such thing as safe texts.
