The trouble with comparing a poet with a radio is that radios<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't develop scar-tissue. The tubes burn out, or with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transistor, which most souls are, the battery or diagram<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burns out replacable or not replacable, but not like that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;punchdrunk fighter in a bar. The poet<p>

Takes too many messages. The right to the ear that floored him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in New Jersey. The right to say that he stood six rounds with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a champion.<p>

Then they sell beer or go on sporting commissions, or, if the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scar tissue is too heavy, demonstrate in a bar where the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invisible champions might not have hit him. Too many of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.<p>

The poet is a radio. The poet is a liar. The poet is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counterpunching radio.<p>

And those messages (God would not damn them) do not even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know they are champions.<br>
