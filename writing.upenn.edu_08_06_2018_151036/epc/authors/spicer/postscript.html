What have I lost? When shall I start to sing<br>
A loud and idiotic song that makes<br>
The heart rise frightened into poetry<br>
Like birds disturbed?<p>

I was a singer once. I sang that song.<br>
I saw the thousands of bewildered birds<br>
Breaking their cover into poetry<br>
Up from the heart.<p>

What have I lost? We lived in forests then,<br>
Naked as jaybirds in the ever-real,<br>
Eating our toasted buns and catching flies,<br>
And sometimes angels, with our hooting tongues.<p>

I was a singer once. In distant trees<br>
We made the forests ring with sacred noise<br>
Of gods and bears and swans and sodomy,<br>
And no one but a bird could hear our voice.<p>

What have I lost? The trees were full of birds.<br>
We sat there drinking at the sour wine<br>
In gallon bottles. Shouting song<br>
Until the hunters came.<p>

I was a singer once, bird-ignorant.<br>
Time with a gun said, &quot;Stop,<br>
Find other forests. Teach the innocent.&quot;<br>
God got another and a third<br>
Birdlimed in Eloquence.<p>

What have I lost? At night my hooting tongue,<br>
Naked of feathers and of softening years,<br>
Sings through the mirror at me like a whippoorwill<br>
And then I cannot sleep.<p>

&quot;I was a singer once,&quot; it sings.<br>
&quot;I sing the song that every captured tongue<br>
Sang once when free and wants again to sing.<br>
But I can sing no song I have not sung.&quot;<p>

What have I lost? Spook singer, hold your tongue.<br>
I sing a newer song no ghost-bird sings.<br>
My tongue is sharpened on the iron's edge.<br>
Canaries need no trees. They have their cage.<p>
