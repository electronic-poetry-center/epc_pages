This ocean, humiliating in its disguises<br>
Tougher than anything.<br>
No one listens to poetry. The ocean<br>
Does not mean to be listened to. A drop<br>
Or crash of water. It means<br>
Nothing.<br>
It<br>
Is bread and butter<br>
Pepper and salt. The death<br>
That young men hope for. Aimlessly<br>
It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals. No<br>
One listens to poetry.<br>
