&quot;Limon tree very pretty<br>
And the limon flower is sweet<br>
But the fruit of the poor lemon<br>
Is impossible to eat&quot;<br>
In Riverside we saved the oranges first (by smudging) and left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lemons last to fed for themselves. They didn't usually<br>
A no good crop. Smudge-pots<br>
Didn't rouse them. The music<br>
Is right though. The lemon tree<br>
Could branch off into real magic. Each flower in place. We<br>
Were sickened by the old lemon.

Pieces of the past arising out of the rubble. Which evokes Eliot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then evokes Suspicion. Ghosts all of them. Doers of no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good.<br>
The past around us is deeper than.<br>
Present events defy us, the past<br>
Has no such scruples. No funeral processions for him. He died<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in agony. The cock under the thumb.<br>
Rest us as corpses<br>
We poets<br>
Vain words.<br>
For a funeral (as I live and breathe and speak)<br>
Of good<br>
And impossible<br>
Dimensions.

In the far, fat Vietnamese jungles nothing grows.<br>
In Guadacanal nothing grew but a kind of shrubbery that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the bar-conversation of your best best friend who was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not able to talk.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br>
Sheets to the wind. No<br>
Wind being present.<br>
No<br>
Lifeboats being present. A jungle<br>
Can't use life-boats. Dead<br>
From whatever bullets the snipers were. Each<br>
Side of themselves. Safe-<br>
Ly delivered.

The rind (also called the skin) of the lemon is difficult to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand.<br>
It goes around itself in an oval quite unlike the orange which, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone can tell, is a fruit easily to be eaten.<br>
It can be crushed into all sorts of extracts which are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still not lemons. Oranges have no such fate. They're pretty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much the same as they were. Culls become frozen orange<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;juice. The best oranges are eaten.<br>
It's the shape of the lemon, I guess that causes trouble. It's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ovalness, it's rind. This is where my love, somehow, stops.
