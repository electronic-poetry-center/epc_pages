&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no rules for this but it should be<br>
simultaneous if at all.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Homosexuality is essentially being alone. Which is<br>
a fight against the capitalist bosses who do not want<br>
us to be alone. Alone we are dangerous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dissatisfaction could ruin America. Our love<br>
could ruin the universe if we let it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If we let our love flower into the true revolution<br>
we will be swamped with offers for beds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The jets hate politics. They grew up in fat cat society <br>
that didn't even have a depression or a war in it. They <br>
are against capital punishment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They really couldn't care less. They wear switch-blade<br>
knives tied with ribbons. They know that which runs<br>
this country is an IBM machine connected to an IBM <br>
machine. They never think of using their knives against<br>
its aluminum casing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A League Against Youth and Fascism should be formed<br>
immediately by our Party. They are our guests. They are<br>
ignorant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in the golden dawn of homosexuality there was<br>
a philosopher who gave the formula for a new society - <br>
&quot;from each, according to his ability, to each according<br>
to his need.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This formula appears in the New Testament - the<br>
parable of the fig tree - and elsewhere.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue the argument is fruitless.
