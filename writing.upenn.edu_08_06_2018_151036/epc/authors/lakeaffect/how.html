         <p>
	   Lake Affect never simply reads poems over standard musical accompaniment.  Rather, 
         we craft a multi-media assemblage of sound that defies traditional notions of music 
         or poetry.  Text takes on a whole new function in our music, and music interacts with 
         text in a way heretofore unexplored.  The musical aspects of language are brought to 
         the surface and used as compositional elements. Likewise, music starts to behave like 
         a language, partaking of the structural elements of the poem.<br>
         In its work with poets, Lake Affect has developed a number of techniques, which have 
         proved very fertile.   Poetic metaphors, images, atmospheres, poetic formal structures,
         semantic meanings --any and all can be used as jumping off points for artistic 
         inventions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Departing from rigorous formal musical training, we aim to break free from all imposed
         parameters. We constantly strive to force the limits of all preconceived notions and 
         standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         The collaborating poet gives us several poems, and we select a few that suggest sonic 
         possibilities. All the pieces are the result of an experimental group compositional 
         process, keeping those elements (musical phrases, instrumentation, rhythmic patterns,
         and special sound effects) that work best. Some of the creative techniques are the 
         free improvisation, exchange of ideas with the poets, and analytical discussions on 
         the poem’s form and sonic material. At the end of this process, firm decisions are made,
         so that each piece achieves its own musical and structural identity.
        </p>
        <p> 
         The musical form of some pieces is extracted from the formal structure of the poem or 
         the special reading that its author gives of it. For example, City of Webs throws 
         together an accelerating cluster of sounds and speech fragments that matches the 
         background taped voice of the poet delivering his piece in its two dimensions: its 
         wandering reading around the page and its nasal chanting timbral nature.<br>
         The sonic material becomes thematic in other pieces like A moment. Its phonemes are 
         brought alive as living creatures, being both transformed and elaborated into musical 
         evocations: the "crow" (protagonist of the poem) is now a "lion roar" or a rolling "r"
         sung inside a "cowbell."
        </p>
        <p>
         There are also semantic approaches. Lorca is buried here honors the original gypsy 
         roots of Garc&iacute;a Lorca and his unknown burial place with the bells of his non existent 
         funeral and a Gypsy-Moorish lament of the voice that languishes in an ecstatic 
         "<dfn title="Andalusian song performed in religious ceremonies during Lent and Easter">saeta.</dfn>"<br>
         The quartet uses a sophisticated variety of instruments: two full sets of percussion 
         (tam-tams, cow bells, vibraphone, marimba, chimes, lion roar, loujon, etc), synthesizer
         and amplified or processed voice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both in live performances and recordings, we encourage collaborating poets to read 
         their works before or after our rendition. We have even in recent pieces worked to 
         model our versions over the simultaneous live reading of the poet or prerecorded 
         processed tape of their voices. This juxtaposition has been successful in highlighting
         the trajectory from the poem to our creation.
