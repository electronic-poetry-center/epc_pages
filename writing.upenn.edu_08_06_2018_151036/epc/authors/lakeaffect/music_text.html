<h2>Music and Text</h2>
<p>
<img  class=music src="images/insidediv30.jpg"><br>
Music and text have been both allies and enemies throughout history.
The earliest written accounts of music making are concerned with the texts linked to it, 
and numerous ancient treatises are dedicated to the question of whether music or text should 
predominate. These often included specific music tricks (scales, melodic ideas, instrumentation,
and rhythmic patterns) which would enhance the text by eliciting the appropriate emotions.
<br>Others argued that texts enslave music by forcing it into a solely accompanimental role.
</p>
<p class=fly>
&#171; Music could highlight what the text wanted to hide, ignore what the text wanted to stress...&#187;
</p>
<p>
The conflict, derived from the hopeless asemantic nature of music and the tendency towards 
representation of most texts, suggests many roads for its resolution.
</p>
<p>
One thing, however, is clear to us: once the text enters the realm of interaction with music, 
it never the same. As Pierre Boulez wrote, once a text is set to music, it may even become 
foreign to its author. The result is a new text with a new layer of meaning. Music could 
highlight what the text wanted to hide, ignore what the text wanted to stress, or even separate
words from one another, creating a dramatic timing nonexistent in the original text.
</p> 
<p>
It is similar to how colors work for painters, once two colors are put together, they are never
the same again, they suffer irreversible alterations. Text also has this effect on music: no 
color is stainless.
</p>
<p>
The resulting conflict, the arena of this battle of mutual modification, is the heart and soul 
of the relationship between music and text. Lake Affect is aware of this, and committed to 
explore it.
</p>
<p>
Lake Affect bases its work on collaborations with poets and writers in order to enjoy this 
dynamic puzzle. Each writer creates a unique world, a plane which, when intercepted and 
multiplied by the already tridimensional musical perspective of Lake Affect, explodes into the 
unknown.
