 As The Australian Council for the Arts has asked me to be the 'official'
 coordinator of John Kinsella's upcoming tour of the US & Canada, I thought
 it would be a good idea to let people on this list know about it. John
 sometimes posts here, so you will know the name. He is one of the finest
 younger Australian poets, with a startlingly wide range, & able to do the
 job in all the kinds of poetry he writes. Lyn Hejinian wrote quite
 correctly of his recent _Erratum/Frame(d)_ (in her Preface):
<blockquote>
         It has often been remarked that John Kinsella has two bodies of work.
         His very recent volume, _The Silo: A Pastoral Symphony_ (one notes that
         its title foregrounds a musical analogy) can be cited as exemplary of a
         meditative, narrative mode of poetry, while the work collected here
         could be said to represent his interests in the 'experimental'. But the
         difference between the books is, in fact, an epistemological one -- a
         question of where what's known lies. And this, in turn, is a temporal
         question. _The Silo_ is a book of memory -- and inevitably, a book of
         landscapes, since it is in landscapes that the past is most clearly
         embodied in present forms. _Erratum/Frame(d)_ is a book of the present
         'denying its geography, blurring genre.'
</blockquote> 

 I dont have the venues, except for the University of Calgary, University of
 Alberta, and University of Northern British Columbia, but Kinsella will be
 in Buffalo Nov 7; Burlington Nov 8-9; Boston Nov 13; Portland Nov 15;
 Newark Nov 21; San Francisco Nov 23; Newark (New York?) Nov 24; Edmonton
 Nov 26; Prince George Nov 28; Calgary Nov 29 (I got these dates & places
 from his itinerary, so the readings in some places may be a bit tentative).
 Look for announcements, & catch this fine young poet from Australia, made
 possible by a grant from The Australian Council for the Arts and the
 various host institutions.
