<font size=6>The Opening Scenes of Doctor Faustus</font><p>

(Being Book 5 of <i>Graphology</i> )<p>
<br>

Obey'd in their severall Provinces<br>
premiers slice up the mineral wealth,<br>
keeping the boundaries of their codices<br>
intact, wives busy as hansard reporters,<br>
writ in iron-tannin ink as down by the creek<br>
ti-tree stains the waters,<br>
night heron hunched in the shadows<br>
permanently, burning into<br> 
parchment mise en abyme,<br>
that Goddamn reflection<br>
coming back at me,<br>
thriving in the glass in this place's<br>
anti-history,<br>
all quills dipped in oak galls<p>

and iron salts, drunk on the urine<br>
of a visitor from the old country,<br>
rendering shadows<br>
lampblack and calling death<br>
something else, and everything else<br>
externall trash.<br>
B-text they uttered in the stalls<br>
as if authority need not be intoned,<br>
as divinity falls by the wayside<br>
and the poet becomes a demi-devil<br>
in the restoration of Valdes and Cornelius<br>
who had long back lost their Narcissism,<br>
despite appearances;<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Scholars and Wagner<p>

chewing the fat, refusing to conjure<br>
textus as godspellara,<br>
authenticating through vademecum,<br>
inscribing endpapers with likely<br>
outcomes while Caius drank deeply<br>
milk straight from the breast-<br>
the medical text-as in raising<br>
Mephostophilis Faustus is incredulous<br>
that Meph misses the green fields<br>
of heaven, the world endlessly<br>
revolving with wealth and expanse;<br>
on the membrane indenture<br>
knifed severally as authentic,<br>
a hooded bird recalls flying<p>

into a plate glass window,<br>
confronting English glass<br>
in a Danish frame,<br>
"Zounds, boy in your face!"<br>
gurgles Robin, the clown, Zounds!<br>
architecture whose quiddity<br>
is the integrity of the sails<br>
on Sydney harbour, O splendid<br>
Opera House, in which the parallels<br>
of Said might be drawn at an honorary dinner,<br>
but probably won't, while in Melbourne<br>
they'll have none of it, protecting best<br>
what the centre cannot hold,<br>
pathetic remnant of empire!<p>

Zounds says Robin, come again,<br>
who'll drive back the floods threatening<br>
these islands? Bishop Cox of Ely<br>
backs him up: "And because he doth<br>
intend to bestow cost to drain it, and bank it,<br>
to keep it hereafter from drowning,<br>
I was willinger to let him have it."<br>
You little bastard! says Wagner,<br>
transliterally, almost in Roman-style<br>
typeface: Quasi vestigiis nostris insistere;<br>
dead nettles crowding the Heidelberg school's<br>
expected revival, the rubrication<br> 
of scarified desert. <br>
Exeunt.<p>
<br><br><br>
 




Decoy in the dwindling<br>
crown-of-jacks,<br>
water to grind,<br>
or deteriorating hand<br>
as if there were an age<br>
of science, concentrated in pools<br>
of teal, brand geese, widgeon and mallard,<br>
or in the lens of Booragoon Lake-<br>
sacred ibis, cormorant, egret, or blue heron,<br>
determinative symbols against<br>
a city backdrop, interlopers<br>
indicated by caret marks:<br>
guides for twitchers where<br>
feathered membranes are<p>

endorsed as Ouse Washes SSSI-<br>
the drainage enterprises of Dutchman<br>
Cornelius Vermuyden: "The spirits<br> 
tell me they can dry the sea,<br>
And fetch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the treasure of all forraine wrackes"<br>
redshank and ruff<br>
roughing it in grassland:<br>
Washes acting up a floodwater<br> 
in laden storage areas;<br>
chronologically high water<br> 
rivering and flooding the Washes<br>
preserving settlements,<br>
suspensions of peat and reed<p>

scripted by mongrel free-hand,<br>
coots clapper claw lying flat on their backs!<br>
having avoided hingles and sprinks<br>
and the humanistic hand<br>
hurling a saucer-shaped earth<br>
into the postcard, John Dyer<br>
double-checking the force<br>
of Nature's rigour, or the materiality<br>
of angels in shellac seals, Miltonic<br>
scorn almost entertaining Empson<br>
while desiring machines<br>
chatter far below the Hebrides,<br>
moving across narrow bridges<br> 
towards the minims of Perth.<br>
