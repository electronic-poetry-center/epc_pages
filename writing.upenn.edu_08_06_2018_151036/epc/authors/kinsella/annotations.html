(Being Book 4 of <I>Graphology</I>)<p>
<br>


Imperfect memory
<br>
has chasms deeply yawning
<br>
in reception, in Rossby<BR>

<br>
waves rip up
<br>
the Northern light,
<br>
authentically driven<BR>

<br>
like song in Virgil's
<br>
ninth eclogue, unable
<br>
to prevent the soldiery<BR>

<br>
claiming territory,
<br>
goats steady on the path
<br>
as a noonday sun<BR>

<br>
is guessed overhead,
<br>
sky like mirrored sea
<br>
somewhere outside<BR>

<br>
the concept, specified
<br>
as nought on a Beaufort scale --
<br>
resistance of city<BR>

<br>
enticing the veritable
<br>
with imitations, odes
<br>
outflanking balladry<br><BR>


<br><br>
and the strongest
<br>
surviving a publicity
<br>
of false announcements,<BR>

<br>
death certificates
<br>
reaping an overwhelming
<br>
narrative voice,<BR>

<br>
the gleaning poet
<br>
wasting chaff,
<br>
winnowing<BR>

<br>
applications 
<br>
of folly, of hydraulics
<br>
and terraces.       Frost<BR>

<br>
harnesses 
<br>
mid-winter days
<br>
and glass houses<BR>

<br>
glower, while brooding
<br>
off-season a cat's-paw settles
<br>
in the sulky waters<BR>

<br>
of vacations --
<br>
kindled like bounties
<br>
itemized as recollection<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
despite weather's
<br>
patterned changing,
<br>
or the Trotskyite<BR>

<br>
throwing a spanner in the works,
<br>
privileged protest,
<br>
viewer-friendly<BR>

<br>
movement, eco-gendered
<br>
and specific,
<br>
plausible selves<BR>

<br>
languishing in a cell
<br>
as if caring only
<br>
for biography,<BR>

<br>
tin cans stressing criteria,
<br>
spray paint deepening as visibility drops
<br>
and Beaufort is a file<BR>

<br>
held in Bangkok,
<br>
an absurdist drama
<br>
just outside a realm<BR>

<br>
of Hansard, hydro-
<br>
logical cycle, or circular
<br>
of phlegms and humors,<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
zones where particles
<br>
are never smaller than atoms,
<br>
and capacity<BR>

<br>
for consistency
<br>
is Aristotelian in its
<br>
magnitude<BR>

<br>
and breadth;
<br>
a flurry driving the stuff
<br>
of a burst flour bag<BR>

<br>
over a small town,
<br>
its only industry,
<br>
Bing Crosby in Dongara<BR>

<br>
Western Australia,
<br>
some time outside his own,
<br>
spatially readjusted<BR>

<br>
in the prospect 
<br>
of Song's Cycle,
<br>
that Menalcas himself<BR>

<br>
had an indigenous 
<br>
turn of phrase, cultish
<br>
in the master territory,<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
sending flares up
<br>
over pacified waters
<br>
and costing millions<BR>

<br>
in wanton search projects,
<br>
fire-stick
<br>
burnt as anti-eco<BR>

<br>
propaganda
<br>
by smart asses hungry
<br>
in the politburos<BR>

<br>
of down under,
<br>
that we might call this
<br>
analogous<BR>

<br>
and diachronically
<br>
Australian: moving in or out
<br>
from a centre,<BR>

<br>
red rock contra-band
<br>
in the traveller&iacute;s tale,
<br>
horizontal<BR>

<br>
conquest, Mont Blanc
<br>
of an unsublime nothingness,
<br>
the pun they might later<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
name as Voss:  dingo
<br>
credited as wolf, incest
<br>
passed off as suppression<BR>

<br>
or continental drift,
<br>
precipitating in tongues
<br>
voiced like nulla nullas,<BR>

<br>
and sulphur-coated authors
<br>
appropriating steady print,
<br>
emphasizing vicarious<BR>

<br>
sandpaintings
<br>
emblematic totalizing missions
<br>
of justice,<BR>

<br>
quivering stretched below
<br>
oak primeval in the empire&iacute;s
<br>
hulks and brigs,<BR>

<br>
leaning to the wind
<br>
as seas of wheat ripple
<br>
and find calibration,<BR>

<br>
ideolectically
<br>
damning a sunning
<br>
lizard, peripheral<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
and itemized
<br>
late in the piece,
<br>
stabilizing<BR>

<br>
yet another chunk
<br>
of bourgeois text
<br>
liberating constructions<BR>

<br>
of time tracked
<br>
as if technology is prognostic
<br>
and curving like swathes<BR>

<br>
of the monitor's tail
<br>
outside the boundaries
<br>
of instinct, distinctly<BR>

<br>
intense on the shores
<br>
of an inland sea, lugged vessel
<br>
lost to sudden storm,<BR>

<br>
the faint echo of hubris
<br>
barely bothering to lend its name
<br>
to such irrelevant<BR>

<br>
activities, at this point
<br>
in time, though inconsistency
<br>
lavishes growth and irrigates<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
doubt self-reflexively,
<br>
in under and over tone
<br>
per source of vibration<BR>

<br>
per pure tone
<br>
and vibrancy 
<br>
thresh-holding the peripheral crops<BR>

<br>
primed with super phosphate
<br>
draining through sand plain
<br>
and percolating. Ground<BR>

<br>
water devaluing
<br>
the filling magnet,
<br>
sundial pulling<BR>

<br>
the sphere concurrently,
<br>
gliding vowels
<br>
as exclamation<BR>

<br>
rests above
<br>
and the sun lies
<br>
weather shift in skies<BR>

<br>
plural and elided,
<br>
condensed as script
<br>
as high density<br><br>
<br>
fields compressed
<br>
behaviourist drilling
<br>
tines occluding <BR>

<br>
nudged furrows
<br>
in observed vents
<br>
goldenly cleaving<BR>

<br>
against silo walls,
<br>
idiomatic anti-contrast
<br>
formalising plough discs<BR>

<br>
and intensifying,
<br>
when with hanging
<br>
fog smoke rises<BR>

<br>
vertically,
<br>
rain following
<br>
Inwards' lore<BR>

<br>
as a warble lodges
<br>
in the syrinx
<br>
and a gift of pipes<BR>

<br>
is accepted
<br>
in another tongue,
<br>
sung hand-in-hand<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
down to the scrawl,
<br>
the Miltonic hand
<br>
inscribing molecular bonds:<BR>

<br>
Poggioli's <I>homo artifex</I>
<br>
restless in the crowd,
<br>
chaining itself to trees<BR>

<br>
destined for the saw,
<br>
pristine interiors
<br>
voiced velar plosive<BR>

<br>
qua prescriptive pulp
<br>
and digestion, fallen
<br>
forms reduce the growing,<BR>

<br>
<I>pass&eacute; simple</I>,
solid
<br>
contracts in groves
<br>
of influence, <BR>

<br>
a boustrophedonic
<br>
atlas inscribed
<br>
in an insular hand,<BR>

<br>
withholding field bins
<br>
against moisture, 
<br>
abundant risk<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
of docking
<br>
at the sample hut,
<br>
the asshole's chirography<BR>

<br>
both fancy and quick,
<br>
flattened on a threshing floor
<br>
of weights and quality<BR>

<br>
and madrigals of cogs and fencing
<br>
wire entangling hungry sheep
<br>
introduced and straining<BR>

<br>
despite the constant
<br>
slaughter, gallows
<br>
frantic beneath an amber<BR>

<br>
metonymy.
<br>
Iron age forts --
<br>
flat and hollow<BR>

<br>
as rings of hills 
<br>
are not -- solid 
<br>
to a granite core,<BR>

<br>
solid accents embedded
<br>
and sexualising 
<br>
the strongest warheads<br><BR>

<br>
remaining after
<br>
disarmament: in Darwin
<br>
yellow cake hovers<BR>

<br>
and Wharfies
<br>
equivocate,
<br>
white singlets glowing <BR>

<br>
lawn mowers coughing
<br>
coagulated oil
<br>
over Southern pastures<BR>

<br>
and board rooms
<br>
of generalization,
<br>
the stereotypical industry<BR>

<br>
chiding hurt given
<br>
by a slight to a stalwart
<br>
acceptably different<BR>

<br>
and sticking his or her neck out
<br>
for a brother or a sister,
<br>
for smooth verse<I> and</I> an unlettered
<BR>

<br>
muse, but not a brandname.
<br>
Unlettered nature pshaws
<br>
the High Table suit<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
as the gong is rung
<br>
and a vegan is catered for
<br>
without obvious fuss:<BR>

<br>
unlettered nature pshaws
<br>
annotation as decoration
<br>
on cake compares<BR>

<br>
with ploughing out fields,
<br>
desert closing in and in and in,
<br>
roused strictly against<BR>

<br>
a bordering comedy,
<br>
distinctly white torrents
<br>
of herbicidal foam<BR>

<br>
within the parallel framework,
<br>
circuits of nostalgia replete
<br>
in dawning, light enhancing<BR>

<br>
the manager's boyish eyes
<br>
as hunters claim to have preserved
<br>
<I>that</I>
species from extinction.<BR>

<br>
A Gotham City decay
<br>
pneumatic on a platform
<br>
of seedling trays<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
donated by the ministry
<br>
hawking tickets in sound
<br>
gardens, sunning<BR>

<br>
ethnic allocation
<br>
as intimate with profit
<br>
and profligacy<BR>

<br>
joined in holy manifestoes
<br>
in new countries,
<br>
overlaying,<BR>

<br>
palimpsesting
<br>
and re-creating
<br>
myths of origin<BR>

<br>
to account
<br>
for missing books
<br>
and dampen the sound<BR>

<br>
of oratory; art deco
<br>
like stations of a neglected
<br>
cross that could<BR>

<br>
name names if subpoenaed,
<br>
restless with a city's litigation,
<br>
closing optimism<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
by the agency
<br>
and counterbalancing
<br>
rival claims as they work<BR>

<br>
to diminish sovereignty
<br>
or rearrange Niagara falls
<br>
as units of drainage<BR>

<br>
or philanthropy,
<br>
artificial lakes bobbing up
<br>
like satellites<BR>

<br>
in contradictory orbits,
<br>
tossed corpses risen
<br>
on gas beds,<BR>

<br>
defrosting apathy
<br>
and the town electing
<br>
a new mayor.<BR>

<br>
Collective action
<br>
threatens to save
<br>
a wild life sanctuary<BR>

<br>
and foxes are busy
<br>
gnawing away at the wildlife,
<br>
as if they had some other <br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
place to go
<br>
and are being down right malicious,
<br>
as in, you know, they rip<BR>

<br>
the heads of chickens
<br>
just for the hell of it,
<br>
observing codes of unknowing<BR>

<br>
like repetition --
<br>
you can bet your bottom
<br>
dollar on it<BR>

<br>
in any currency
<br>
or jargon of insecurity --
<br>
no Trojan horse threatening<BR>

<br>
to undermine evaluation
<br>
as action in-itself,
<br>
this cult of courtesy.<BR>

<br>
Distrust profoundly this I
<br>
the autograph hunter employs
<br>
as sample or prompt,<BR>

<br>
as worth n/a's its awe,
<br>
as lock stock and barrel
<br>
and ankh and crucifix<br><br>
<br>
are honestly exploited
<br>
as fictions and I allows
<br>
the God in self<BR>

<br>
free expression,
<br>
questioning hybridity
<br>
on the fringes of modernity,<BR>

<br>
like white-walled wheels
<br>
leaving burn-out marks
<br>
on the road stretching<BR>

<br>
all the way
<br>
to liberation theology,
<br>
overcast and dry<BR>

<br>
as lightning strokes
<br>
a distant coast
<br>
and I sweats<BR>

<br>
under boughs
<br>
of corrugated iron
<br>
mimicking flight delays<BR>

<br>
in spaces growing less stable
<br>
with each diminishing front,
<br>
the tiny compass in the sole<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
of your shoe leading
<br>
it astray. Machine op-
<br>
erators cling like<BR>

<br>
testosterone 
<br>
whirled out of 
<br>
the dynamo<BR>

<br>
where horizon
<br>
is a manipulation
<br>
of shadow and electricity<BR>

<br>
and the elegy
<br>
is the profoundest ex-
<br>
pression of love,<BR>

<br>
an exceptional network
<br>
of otherness
<br>
and referentiality:<BR>

<br>
the facts
<br>
dragging snow
<br>
off the lake<BR>

<br>
as more than method
<br>
effects gaps in whiteness,
<br>
a production-line mausoleum<br><BR>

<br>
regionally enacting
<br>
where I becomes they and we
<br>
and rolls off;<BR>

<br>
as labour divides
<br>
componentry
<br>
in a discourse<BR>

<br>
of exclusion
<br>
fringe
<br>
communicates<BR>

<br>
with fringe,
<br>
let us know
<br>
about it.<BR>

<br>
Because the you has moved
<br>
calque undulates about a scene
<br>
reminiscent<BR>

<br>
of a home run
<br>
hit in a big game
<br>
by a team whose town<BR>

<br>
is on the brink 
<br>
of bankruptcy.
<br>
And tourists<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
won't care and don't
<br>
and won't go where 
<br>
a trophy dislodges poverty<BR>

<br>
in a grand room
<br>
that is treeless and without
<br>
tracts of water,<BR>

<br>
bitter birds 
<br>
kerning tunes 
<br>
on fence posts,<BR>

<br>
generic fumblings
<br>
itemizing
<br>
change rooms.<BR>

<br>
The power-lifted soil
<br>
supports bloated granules
<br>
of succession,<BR>

<br>
each weed uttering
<br>
monopolies of stanzas,
<br>
hedgerows cut back<BR>

<br>
as copse planters
<br>
head out against a sharp cold,
<br>
deflecting rotation<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
and insisting,
<br>
radarscopic blanking
<br>
enforcing fallowness,<BR>

<br>
direction
<br>
as progressive
<br>
as depth<BR>

<br>
in the play of light,
<br>
a surface current
<br>
playing up like popularity<BR>

<br>
ridging-in over
<br>
high art, a Theocritan
<br>
portraiture<BR>

<br>
indicating position
<br>
with precision, the tractor
<br>
clumping lugs of clay<BR>

<br>
in rotations
<br>
sublimating
<br>
the craved for object,<BR>

<br>
atmospheric
<br>
machine propagating
<br>
subaltern speech<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
(Homi Bhabha c/- Gareth Griffiths)
<br>
maintaining the <I>for</I>
<br>
in <I>it's</I> in-between<BR>

<br>
an edictness of English,
<br>
a first crop's struggle
<br>
expectedly on Walden Pond<BR>

<br>
uncertain, assaulting
<br>
darkly the rudest places,
<br>
<I>those dark unruly spaces<BR>
</I>
<br>
surfacing the carapace
<br>
of earth, busy
<br>
in strengthening<BR>

<br>
strain
<br>
and the comfort
<br>
of parchment.<BR>

<br>
Facts indulge such 
<br>
as Yakabindie Bob
<br>
paying almost nothing<BR>

<br>
for the labourings
<br>
of indigenes, 
<br>
tribal women<br><BR>
<BR>

<br>
currency
<br>
against the binaries
<br>
of wool and starvation,<BR>

<br>
the prevalence of 
<br>
<I>of</I> and<I>
the</I>
<br>
in the pastoral quiddity:<BR>

<br>
a hard time of it was had
<br>
beneath the oral tree,
<br>
as story ran into story<BR>

<br>
under the clauses
<br>
of speech event,
<br>
the curing ritual.<BR>

<br>
A storm rolls in
<br>
tithing angular blooms
<br>
out of dirt,<BR>

<br>
red dust runs as wine
<br>
over the front pages
<br>
of a local rag,<BR>

<br>
and celebration
<br>
is named as corroboration
<br>
or uprising.<BR>
