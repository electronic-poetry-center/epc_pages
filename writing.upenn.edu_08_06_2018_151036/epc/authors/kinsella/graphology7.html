With the route<br>
decided on they set out,<br>
rigorously noting<br>
<br>
Long on one of his walks<br>
pressed absorbent<br>
surfaces, code-switching<br>
<br>
& uttering names of place<br>
realised in moments<br>
of inculcation:<br>
<br>
Beverley & York & the Streets<br>
of Scarborough impressing<br>
themselves on maps<br>
<br>
the persona grew up with,<br>
though "here" it's more built-up<br>
& the gaps between signposts<br>
<br>
are shorter: a wandering voice,<br>
a pair of blue eyes<br>
instanced in the brief parish:<br>
<br>
"When Elfride fell asleep<br>
that night she was loving<br>
the writer of the letter,<br>
<br>
but thinking of the writer<br>
of that article." Associating<br>
sentential features<br>
<br>
against a spreading sky - <br>
yes, & even "condoning<br>
the jaw's lexis", despite<br>
<br>
the stilled floater, iconic<br>
in the screen's simulated<br>
movements. The flows. The flows.<br>
<br>
Butcher recommends: punctuation<br>
at the end changed to fit<br>
surrounding sentence, e.g. so that<br>
<br>
sen-tence does not end<br>
with a comma <br>
(Displayed quotations)<br>
<br>
what each writer in a tryst<br>
might be inscribing to each other,<br>
"nonnulli sensus",<br>
<br>
as if on cheap paper <br>
this might be a rustic<br>
correspondence -<br>
<br>
transcribe is a better word <br>
as visual encryptions of speech <br>
temporality of the word, <br>
<br>
despite the claims <br>
of oral traditions<br>
& "signatures" of scr[y]pt, <br>
<br>
& ersatz reading <br>
of personality traits <br>
through handwriting <br>
<br>
like the choir monks<br>
of Rievaulx when the Abbey<br>
was at its peak<br>
<br>
& not remotely sublime,<br>
in fact sublimity<br>
being the antithesis<br>
<br>
of good management <br>
& sound latrines:<br>
Cistercians, Prynne, <br>
<br>
& parallel poetries<br>
(----- Message Text -----)<br>
"which is mere conjecture"<br>
<br>
yes, Eliot of course, <br>
but direct engagement? <br>
Peripheral recognition?<br>
<br>
An intrusive "critical voice" <br>
disturbing <br>
"the latent matrix"(?)<br>
<br>
per the intrusion <br>
of the<br>
lyrical<br>
<br>
into the poem. Clarify<br>
the specially-read <br>
persona - i.d. -<br>
<br>
anti-lyrical notary<br>
adding up an-Other, <br>
or creating <br>
<br>
a central register <br>
to fringe against. The machinery, <br>
the gauche illumination. <br>
<br>
All is annotation<br>
to the project <br>
of validating presence: <br>
<br>
script as the precursor <br>
of immortality - spiritualists<br>
busy about the cabinet<br>
<br>
as automatically<br>
two pens utter loudly<br>
& softly, faintly<br>
<br>
& darkly. I undo <br>
the utterance <br>
& contradict. <br>
<br>
The typeface<br>
is voice, significantly<br>
other & not the speaker, <br>
<br>
or singer, or utterer. <br>
But handwriting<br>
can't quite get free <br>
<br>
of itself. Which manuscript <br>
do we take. Valid number? <br>
The proof is [in] the theorem.<br>
<br>
Graphology dressed as closure. <br>
It comes after the drafts.<br>
As if that process is complete. <br>
<br>
There is sheep shit<br>
& it sticks to the soles<br>
of your shoes.<br>
<br>
Fills the tread.<br>
Black-faced sheep shaggy with tails<br>
& not like the tight-wooled merino<br>
<br>
whose shit is often<br>
hard &amp; black<br>
where the I comes from.<br>
<br>
And there is a picture of a paddock<br>
which is like a field though might<br>
be bigger given the general expanse<br>
<br>
& Fuji colour has it deeper than any<br>
blue this part of the world could muster.<br>
Maybe it's something to do with Chernobyl.<br>
<br>
Shouldn't eat the mushrooms in Eastern Europe<br>
& maybe even Germany they say. Coating<br>
everything with pesticide the South West<br>
<br>
Australians are proud <br>
of their clean, vigorous,<br>
and robust food.<br>
<br>
But a victim <br>
of its own analysis, <br>
it becomes draft. <br>
<br>
I read somewhere <br>
or maybe I said it first or<br>
independently<br>
<br>
or imagined myself <br>
to have done so that <br>
Aboriginal sand paintings<br>
<br>
are the most permanent <br>
kind of art. Sand as script. <br>
Though it is recalled now<br>
<br>
that the remark was made<br>
anonymously<br>
by an audience member<br>
<br>
after a paper <br>
was given at Klagenfurt<br>
Uni, Austria.<br>
