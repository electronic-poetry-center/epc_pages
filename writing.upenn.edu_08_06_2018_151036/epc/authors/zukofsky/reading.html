<font size=+1><b>Week One (1-4 April)</b></font> <p>

<b>1. </b>Intro.</b> Your reading of Zukofsky, my reading of
Zukofsky. Our reading of Zukofsky?  1970 AN ERA, Valentine, postcards,
tricolor sign-off, dedications, 's = z ears and eyes. Little
wrists. Drive, fast kisses, a mouth at her ear. Cig crackle at poet's
ear. Look into your ear. CZ, see, sea, centum, cento, centuple + 100
lines of "A"-22 "an" song. 1970 is the last big jumping point,
intended to take in the millenium. Look at Epigraph and #80
Zinnia. Look at Much Ado About Trees. Consider shape of Complete Short
Poetry.  <p>

<b>2.</b> "A" 22 &23 (1970-74). Big and little, much in
little. Navigating within frames leaves you free to float about
listening. Voices, variations. Natural history, human history, 5000
years of written record sounded. And Music Sections. Notebooks,
blueprints, workshop. The role of Texas 1963-97. Ch. 1-2 of ML. Look
at close of "A"-23<p>

<p> 

<b> 1.</b> Catullus, "A"-7 (Kora!), the two translations of Catullus
8. Reading the passionate old guy's lips like an ignorant
American. WCW's SAPPHO "Peer of the gods is that man" vs. "I feel
sick," VOICES. Close read passage in
"A"-22: (i) coming in cold (ii) after some dictionary work (iii)
having looked at the mss. Tapes: Cats, "A"-7, "A"-22.
<p> 

<b>2.</b>  Bottom: on Shakespeare: Part One and "Contiments." SEEING
CLEAR. Clear-eyed physical vision, versus the mind;s eye. Vision?
Visions? Alphabet of Subjects, Alphabet of Creation. What price the
Zohar? Valentines and some Flowers (pick out 11 April anniversary plus
Shak birthday dedications).

(This gets loose . . .)
<p> 

Jenny P will be here from 15-19th.which means double tracking with her
Niedecker material. She wants to look at the Lake Superior Poems
compositionally. This will take up one session (Wednesday?). We'll use
previous discussion of "A" and Flowers composition to compare LN's approach
to the writing of a long poem at a time when she's not directly influenced
by LZ. For this to work, you need to have read "Lake Superior" and Jenny's
commentary on it in the Correspondence.
<p>

This might be the week in which to organise a right-through reading of the
Flowers alongside same for "Lake Superior" and whatever other LN
Jenny suggests.
<p>

Friday session could be allocated for JP's presentation of new LN mss
poems.
Enlarging what is known.

<a name="week4"><font size=+1><b> Week Four (22-26 April)</b></font>
<P> 

<b> 1.</b> 80 Flowers intensive. Your Turn. Audio surface impressions,
associations of title flower, take it apart for reference. Then?
Multiple audience, multiple reading. Unreadable. A rose is a rose is a
rose . . . and they are Tender Buttons, deictic, private,
virtuoso. Now they are also (Udo Kasemets) musucal settings. Time to
talk about "A"-24 and performance. And what else?  <p> 

<b> 2.</b> Friday/Saturday is conference. We can schedule an
alternative seminar meeting earlier in the week if anyone feels like
it. If anyone is still standing. Over to you.  </blockquote> </body>
