      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=1>&nbsp;Louis Zukofsky's 
      <I>Bottom: On Shakespeare</I> was originally published by Austin-based Ark 
      Press in 1963 as a two volume work containing Zukofsky's text and his 
      wife, Celia's, setting of Shakespeare's Pericles to music. The work was 
      republished in 1987 by University of California Press and, after a period 
      of being out-of-print, again in 2002 by Wesleyan University Press with an 
      introduction by Bob Perelman. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=1>&nbsp;"Re-Reading 
      <I>Bottom: On Shakespeare</I> a Symposium," scheduled for October 31st and 
      November 1st of 2003 at the University of Buffalo, will bring established 
      and emerging scholars together to make use of the generous resources at UB 
      and within the Buffalo Poetry and Arts community. Together, we will 
      revisit this groundbreaking, yet highly esoteric text in an attempt to 
      examine the ways this text has been read in the past, and to test one of 
      the most highly regarded, but least understood works of the 20th Century. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=1>&nbsp;Among other 
      events participants may look forward to at the symposium are presentations 
      by Bob Perelman, author of <I>The Trouble with Genius</I>, <I>The 
      Marginalization of Poetry</I>, and numerous books of poetry, and Mark 
      Scroggins, author of <I>Louis Zukofsky and the Poetry of Knowledge</I> and 
      <I>Anarchy</I>, as well as a series of workshops geared towards discussing 
      shorter papers on Bottom by scholars, students and poets. The first of 
      these workshops will be co-moderated by Perelman and Scroggins; the second 
      by poet-scholars Gregg Biglieri and Louis Cabri. Those work-shopping 
      papers include: Antony Adolf, Barbara Cole, Steve Collis, Michael Cross, 
      Kaplan P. Harris, Nick Lawrence, Nick Salvo, Trevor Speller, Jessica 
      Smith, Sasha Steensen, Paul Stephens, and Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas.
