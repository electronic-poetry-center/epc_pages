I.  THE UNDERDRAWINGS
<p>
The New comes forward in its edges in order to be itself;
<p>
its volume by necessity becomes violent and three-dimensional<br>
and ordinary, all similar models shaken off and smudged
<p>
as if memory were an expensive thick creamy paper and every<br>
corner turned now in partial erasure,
<p>
even bits of pearly rubber, matchstick and lucent plastic<br>
leaving traces of decision and little tasks performed
<p>
as if each dream or occasion of pain had tried to lift itself<br>
entirely away, contributing to other corners, planes and<br>
accumulated depth

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*
<p>

the wing is not static but frayed, layered, fettered, furling and
stony
<p>
its feathers cut as if from tissue or stiffened cheesecloth<br>
condensed in preparation for years of stagework
<p>
attached to its historic tendons; more elaborate<br>
the expansive ribcage, grieving, stressed, yet
<p>
marked midway along the breastbone with grains of light

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*
<p>

there are two men, they are tall men, and they are talking softly<br>
among the disintegrating cubes

III. WING: VIA VANVITELLI
<p>
It can happen that the intoxicating wing will draw the mind as a<br>
bow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cubic route of wing falls backwards with light<br>
leaking through at the edge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cube is formally particular<br>
and a part of speech and lost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it looks for like kind,<br>
regardless of function, and attempts to replace itself&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
square root of anything captures and holds, seeming to be final,<br>
and we are grateful&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the delicate marks along the<br>
feather and we follow, now to define or depict the outskirts of<br>
meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plume of smoke or any of the growths which cover <br>
the bodies of birds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To form a model of the wing's surface,<br>
the cube arrives on a day called &quot;the darkest day&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its<br>
likeness consists of strength, atonality, pigment, emptiness and<br>
shafts partly hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put my mouth just at the opening where<br>
a steel edge gives way to an angle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from which light emerges<br>
along its soft narrow barbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the wing had a voice it would<br>
open through a shaft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I am not of that feather</i>

<p><br><br><br><br>

V. COLOR: VIA DELLA PENITENZA
<p>
Even the New is attached or marked by attachment
<p>
the shimmer of wing, which claim may tell us everything<br>
in a white blink
<p>
just as in troubled moments it disappears
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[A young girl in Arkansas, the quill of an angel in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warm light, from orange and yellow regions, falls]
<p>
Waking touched
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[an angel stands in technicolor as cosmonauts look out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet-liner wingspan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attaching itself collectively]
<p>
these retinal bodies larger, remarkable for their iridescence

note: &quot;WING&quot; was suggested by Mel Bochner's <i>Drawings</i> (David Nolan Gallery, NYC, 1988) and by Bochner's 1993 installation <i>Via Tasso</i> at the Museo Storico della Liberazione di Roma; Jess's &quot;paste-up&quot; (cover of Norma Cole's <i>Mars</i>) delivered my point of focus for entering and retrieving certain materials of the poem.  &quot;WING&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Joe Brainard, who died of AIDS during its writing, and to his companion, the poet and librettist Kenward Elmslie, who has kept the spirit of reinvented language alive.
