ALIGN="CENTER">PROLOGUE: TWO VOICES</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two
voices on a page. Or is it one? Now turning in on themselves, back
into fiber and leaf, now branching into sequence, consequence, public
works projects or discord. Now touching, now trapped in frames without
dialog box. Both tentative, as if poring over old inscriptions, when
perhaps the wall is crumbling, circuits broken, pages blown off by a
fall draft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if voices wrestle on the page, their impact on
the air is part of their definition. In a play, for instance, the
sentences would be explained by their placement on stage. We would not
ask an actress what anguish her lines add up to. She would not worry
what her voice touches, would let it spill over the audience, aiming
beyond the folds of the curtain, at the point in the distance called
the meaning of the play. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difference of our sex, says one voice, saves us
from humiliation. It makes me shiver, says the other. Your voice drops
stones into feelings to sound their depth. Then warmth is truncated to
war. But I'd like to fall back into simplicity as into a
featherbed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Voices, planted on the page, do not ripen or bear
fruit. Here placement does not explain, but cultivates the vacancy
between them. The voices pause, start over. Gap gardening which, moved
inward from the right margin, suspends time. The suspension sets, is
set, in type, in columns that precipitate false memories of garden,
vineyard, trellis. Trembling leaf, rules of black thumb and white,
invisible angle of breath and solid state. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She tries to draw a strength she dimly feels out of
the weaknesses she knows, as if predicting an element in the periodic
table. He wants to make a flat pebble skim across the water inside her
body. He wonders if, for lack of sky, it takes on the color of skin or
other cells it touches. If it rusts the bones.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pact between page and voice is different from
the compact of voice and body. The voice opens the body. Air, the cold
of the air, passes through and, with a single inflection, builds large
castles. The page wants proof, but bonds. The body cannot keep the
voice. It spills. Foliage over the palisade. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has put a pebble under his tongue. While her
lips explode in conjectures his lisp is a new scale to practice. He
wants his words to lift, against the added odds, to a truth outside
him. In exchange, his father walking down the road should diminish
into a symbol of age. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The page lures the voice with a promise of wood
blossoming. But there is no air. No breath lives in the mouth or
clouds the mirror. On stage, the body would carry the surface we call
mind. Here, surface marries surface, refusing deep waters. Still, the
point of encounter is here, always. Screams rise. Tears fall. Impure
white, legible. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 1</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON THE HORIZONTAL &nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My mother, she says, always spread, irresistibly,
across the entire room, flooding me with familiarity to breed
content. I feared my spongy nature and, hoping for other forms of
absorption, opened the window onto more water, eyes level with its
surface. And lower, till the words "I am here" lost their point with
the vanishing air. Just as it's only in use that a proposition grinds
its lens. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Deciphering, he says, is not a horizontal
motion. Though the way a sentence is meant can be expressed by an
expansion that becomes part of it. As a smile may wide-open a
door. Holding the tools in my mouth I struggle uphill, my body so
perfectly suspended between my father's push and gravity's pull that
no progress is made. As if consciousness had to stay embedded in
carbon. Or copy. Between camp and bomb. But if you try to sound
feelings with words, the stone drops into reaches beyond fathoms. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I <I>am</I> here, she says, I've learned that life
consists in fitting my body to the earth's slow rotation. So that the
way I lean on the parapet betrays dried blood and invisible burns. My
shadow lies in the same direction as all the others, and I can't jump
over it. My mother's waves ran high. She rode them down on me as on a
valley, hoping to flush out the minerals. But I hid my bones under
sentences expanding like the flesh in my years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Language, he says, spells those who love it,
sliding sidelong from word to whole cloth. The way fingers extend the
body into adventure, print, lakes, and Dead-man's-hand. Wherever the
pen pushes, in the teeth of fear and malediction, even to your
signature absorbing you into sign. A discomfort with the feel of home
before it grows into inflamed tissue and real illness. With symptoms
of grammar, punctuation, subtraction of soul. And only death to get
you out.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 2</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON THE VERTICAL &nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must decipher our lives, he says, forward and
backward, down through cracks in the crystal to excrement, entrails,
formation of cells. And up. The way the lark at the end of night
trills vertically out of the grass gh and outside myself, though
regularly consumed at high noon. So maybe I should grant the
shoot-out: light may flood me too, completely. But it won't come
walking in boots and spurs, or flowing robes, and take my hand or give
me the finger with the assurance of a more rational being. And my body
slopes toward yours no matter how level the ground.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we can't call it God, he says, it still perches
on the mind, minting strangeness. How could we recognize what we've
never seen? A whale in through the window, frame scattered as far as
non-standard candles. The sky faints along the giant outline, thar she
blows under your skin, tense, a parable right through the body that
remains so painfully flesh. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So pleasurably flesh, she says, and dwells among
us, flesh offered to flesh, thick as thieves, beginning to see. Even
the lark's soar breaks and is content to drop back into yesterday's
gravity. Which wins out over dispersion, even doubt, and our thoughts
turn dense like matter. The way the sky turns deep honey at noon. The
way my sensations seem to belong to a me that has always already sided
with the world.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 3</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON VERTIGO &nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That's why thought, he says, means fear. Sicklied
o'er with the pale cast. And the feel of a woman. No boundary or
edge. No foothold. Blast outspins gravity, breath to temples, gut to
throat, propositions break into gasps. Then marriage. The projectile
returns to the point of firing. Shaken, I try to take shelter in
ratios of dots on a screen. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A narrow bed, she says. Easier to internalize
combustion under a hood while rain falls in sheets, glazing a red
wheelbarrow for the hell of it. I don't bait fabled beasts to rise to
the surface of intonation. But I once watched a rooster mate, and he
felt hard inside me, a clenched fist, an alien rock inside me, because
there was no thinking to dissolve him. So to slide down, so
unutterably, so indifferent. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I don't understand, he says, how manifest destiny
blows west with the grass, how the word "soul" floats through the
language the way pollen pervades tissue. Worry pivots in the gut, a
screeching brake, so scant the difference between mistake and mental
disturbance. Is language our cockadoodledoo? Is thinking a search for
curves? Do I need arrowheads or dreadlocks to reach my rawest
thoughts? A keyboard at their edge? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The longer I watched, she says, the more distinctly
did I feel the snap of that shot flat inside me. So simple the economy
of nature: space appears along with matter. So to slide down and stand
there. Such self-gravity. So narrow the gap between mistake and
morning sickness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 4</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON PLACE&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sit in my own shadow, she says, the way my mother
gave birth to it. In artificial light, blinds drawn against the
darkness of power. I think of you as if you were that shadow, a
natural enclosure, a world, not a slight, so I can wander through your
darkness. Has our contract inverted time, made our universe contract,
a cramped bed for two? And when I say your name, do I draw water, a
portrait, curtain, bridge, or conclusion?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Place there is none, he quotes. Not even to hang up
our archetypes. Let alone Star Spangled Banners. We go forward and
backward, and there is no place. Therefore it is a name for God. My
eye, steadfast on traffic lights, abolishes the larger part of the
round world. I should look at my feet. Space sweeps through us, a hell
of distances bathed in the feeble glow of emptiness. Outward mobility,
unimpeded. Suddenly we're nobody home, without any need of
inattention, imposture, or talent for deceit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wind whips my skin as if it were water, she
says. My skin <I>is </I>water. For wind read wind, news, sky
falling. Is it a mental disturbance or the higher math of love if I
hear you talking under my breath and from the torn fragments assume
the sun is far away and small, and a look can cause a burn?
Superstition, too, is a kind of understanding, and to forego it may
have consequences. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clusters of possibilities whiz through our head, he
says. Electric charges, clogged highway, screeching brakes, a house
too full of guests. With grounds for disagreement and miscarriage. The
light rushes in dry, screaming. But the opaque parts of the nerve
oppose the noise and void the options. Then the project must be
prolonged in terms of lack.</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino,Book Antiqua"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MEDITATION ON FACT </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"I know" is supposed to express a relation between
me and a fact.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">old arteries acquainted with</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where fact is taken into consciousness like your
body into mine, and I'm all sponge and crevice, floating heat and sold
but for the tiny point where I, instead, give birth to myself. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">carrying blood </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">naturally</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or I stumble after, a beginning skater on thin
ice. Or a hawk outlined against the sun brims my eye, the speed of
steep descent its evidence. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">bewitched by </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This picture shows how the light falls, bright as
advertising, not what stokes it at bottom. A desire comes legs apart,
demanding the color red. While the hawk's plummet smears the gap
visible, a scar to be deciphered as force of attraction. Or
gravity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">even as far as the foot</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So my relation to fact lies deep, deep below the
roadbed of inquiry, below the sequence of step and foothold, vowel and
consonant, diminishing with distance. Drowned under thin ice. The sun
far away and small. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 5</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON EDEN&#9;&#9;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unreachable, she says, left of the left margin. A
moment suspended. As if it didn't apply, didn't invite to bite the
apple. Garden caught as in amber by an extra gravitational force. A
sphere with the beauty of curved surfaces that seem flat and
endless. Though it may crack. Sprung reason, hinge or nail.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even a bold garden, he says, is already
wistful. Like the bisons of the cave paintings, the phallic African
gods, the frescos found in Pompeii. As if we could step into an image
of what we have lost. Tight fit of pine and apple trees in turf
studded with a fine fickleness of morning glories. We're not eagles
soaring above, leaving every leaf as it is, but at least we don't fear
flying with the sparrows. And multitudes of insects. The explicit sun,
or maybe inherent wear, occults our act, and we fall back into the old
tale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time, she says, on all sides. Without shore. We
drown if we set foot in, though we're bound to. As incurably as proton
and neutron are bound to the dim world of the nucleus. And once we
learn to breathe in the crash of water desire rushes in, takes hold of
our smallest gesture as of a sail. But at the edge of the picture we
fall. And are born. In all directions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A common nucleus, he says, but different numbers of
double-binds. The earth soaks up semen without drawing conclusions. A
gloved finger says touch and touch me not. But who could live among
ornaments wrought by abstinence? Who could be so thorough?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 6</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON DESIRE &#9;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't you think it a strange coincidence, he says,
that every man whose skull's been opened had a brain? And as late as
1889, Charles Brown-Sequard, a famous French physiologist, at the age
of 72, treated himself for waning vigor with extracts from the
testicles of dogs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What a way to bed hope, she says. With a cherished
pedigree. What <I>I </I>think strange: every photo of the old house
shows wide open shutters when I remember breathing gloom, the light a
mere trickle from a child's pail. Of course I know which one to
inhabit: memory loves hunting in the dark. The added light only
exacerbates the vertigo of inner stairwells. I see you still on the
first step, plucking the word "now" out of the dark thick with
resistance, as if time too had forbidden chambers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bursts the skull, he says, the strong force
coupling gluons and quarks. Flings you. And you all interval, all
excess aspiring to annihilation, slip of wings, a dragonfly so
transparent, so impatient to be kicked out of paradise. But the curve
slackens. The crow doesn't fly as the crow flies. And it's no longer
unthinkable to put on pants and trace scars on a page.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you think there just might be a physiological
explanation? she asks. But what happens in the brain if we always
relate an object to a certain difficulty? The riddle solved, the dust
is supposed to settle. But if the motes keep in motion, the house
under water, shadows swimming through like undeveloped photos or the
inconsolable dead? A space can have this color even though light ought
to be the same to all observers. The frame of memory both distinct and
not distinct from looking at photographs in order to remember. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 7</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON THIRDS&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Opens to the touch, he says, you have to feel it,
and remains as much a stranger. Fields of sesame split wide. You ride,
ribcage abird, toward disappearance, toward a preorganic, duty-free
state of body. As if consciousness curved into minerals, and thought,
at its peak, were only a shiver.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are afraid of each other, she says. That's why
we find a makeshift mistress, a third to be excluded. Then we think we
have cleared the screen, can sit crosslegged inside language and
practice passion according to the Russian novel. But something, a thin
fear of sun-drown, remains between us, measuring the distance as if it
were the essence of being close.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like a color we don't see, but know is contained in
the light? he asks. The force that couples or, if weak, revises
identity and sex? Measuring distances in the mind refracts
emptiness. As if we could touch the infinite when all we do is study
our fingerprints on the lens. And the pain, exacerbated toward the red
end of the spectrum till we're left to howl on a cosmic scale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It matters more <I>how</I><U> </U>something touches
us, she says, manner more than magnitude. Even your body could bulk
foreign into mine. A clinical glitch. Or the light on a clump of
cottonwoods might feel like the giddier light over the Moshassuck when
you know it flows miles away, or that you could take a walk inside
your mind and find me there. The explanations double-lock the
strangeness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONVERSATION 8</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ON BETWEENS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We lie in the dunes, she says, drowned between
sheets to the wind. Green capped white, the surf's disguise of
beginnings, depending on the length of curve observed. If I must have
a god I'll take the matter between noun and verb. The nothing that
defines, shapes next-to into phrase or cleanliness. Then again, the
nothing between the teeth of a comb parts nothing but the nothing
between hairs. So maybe I'd rather have an old woman sprawled barefoot
through fields and space foam, pushing her breasts at any weed in the
world as if the only true way to see were by touch.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An intelligence that comprehends the sperm, he
says. Tubes, valves transporting cells toward strange attractors, riot
canals through the blood, one-way excess. Once you miss one rung of
the ladder you can't stop falling. The hole takes over the argument,
pigeons the sky, and the clouds, so calm a moment ago, blush and swim
wild with reproduction, albeit asexual.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A space between boundary and blur, she says, a
nakedness beyond male and female, edge of the sea. The tongue
surrounds the mouth, so that you answer questions I failed to ask or
pass sentence that has not been pronounced. The way radiation bathes
the entire universe in a feeble glow and thought chases after the
receding galaxies at such speed there is no question of a center and
the squeeze of gravity becomes mere alibi. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But no ducts to the marrow of the mind, he says,
most private part, opaque like a trauma, no fixed address. No
fieldglasses on the firings, the real event, swerve of light. The germ
of your thought swimming too deep. Endlessly in ambush, attention
dissipates into longing. I listen to my thirst and know incurable's
the rule.</P>
