<p>THINKING OF FOLLOWS
<p>I. COMPOSITION AS EXPLANATION
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the beginning there is Gertrude Stein:
"Everything
is the same except
<br>composition and as the composition is different and always going
to
be different
<br>everything is not the same."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also to say, in the beginning is
Aristotle:
"by myth I mean the arrangement
<br>of the incidents."
<p>FRAMEWORK:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a) LINGUISTIC:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every speech act (every use of signs) consists
of
selection and combination (Saussure,
<br>Jakobson). This means words always have a double reference: to the
code and to the
<br>context. The code gives us a vertical axis with substitution sets
where
the elements are
<br>linked by similarity. We choose from them whether to say the man,
the
guy, the fellow,
<br>whether to say walked, ran, ambled, sauntered, etc. Then we
combine
the selected
<br>words on a horizontal axis to say: "the man ran around the
corner."
We put them in a
<br>relation by syntax, by contiguity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Literary language tends to divide according to
an
emphasis on one axis or the other.
<br>Some are more concerned with <i>le mot juste</i>, with <i>the</i>
perfect
metaphor, others, with
<br>what "happens between" the words (Olson).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b) HISTORICAL:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the long stretch from Romanticism through
Modernism
(and on?), poetry has
<br>been more or less identified with the axis of selection, relation
by
similarity, metaphor.
<br>This has large implications:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the "world" is given, but can be
"represented,"
"pictured" in language;
<br>(Baudelaire: "Man walks through a forest of symbols")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the poem is an epiphany inside the poet's
mind
and then "expressed" by
<br>choosing the right words;
<br>that content (and "meaning") is primary and determines its
("organic")
form;
<br>(Creeley/Olson: "Form is never more than an extension of content")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally, that the vertical tendency of metaphor
(Olson: "the suck of symbol")
<br>is our hotline to transcendence, to divine meaning, hence the poet
as priest and prophet.
<p>"SHALL WE ESCAPE ANALOGY" (Claude Royet-Journoud), or,
<br>COMPOSITION AS PROCESS:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing is given. Everything remains to be
constructed.
(Creeley: "a world that's
<br>constantly coming into being")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know beforehand what the poem is going
to say, where the poem is
<br>going to take me. The poem is not "expression," but a cognitive
process
that, to some
<br>extent, changes me. John Cage: "Poetry is having nothing to say
and
saying it: we
<br>possess nothing."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I begin working, far from having an
"epiphany"
to express, I have only a
<br>vague nucleus of energy running to words. As soon as I start
<u>listening</u>
to the words,
<br>they reveal their own vectors and affinities, pull the poem into
their
own field of force,
<br>often in unforeseen directions, away from the semantic charge of
the
original impulse.
<br>What matters is not so much the "thing", not the "right word," but
what "happens
<br>between" (Olson).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Val&eacute;ry: "The poet enters the forest of
language
it is with the express purpose of getting lost"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guest: "The poem enters its own rhythmical
waters."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jab&egrave;s: "The pages of the book are
doors. Words go
through them, driven by their
<br>impatience to regroup...Light is in these lovers' strength of
desire."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duncan: "His intellect intent upon the ratios
and
movements of the poem, he is
<br>almost unaware of depths that may be stirred in his own
psyche. What
he feels is the
<br>depth and excitement of the poem. The poem takes over."
<p>PALIMPSEST:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not true that "nothing is given:"
Language
comes not only with an
<br>infinite potential for new combinations, but with a long history
contained
in it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blank page is not blank. Words are always
secondhand,
says Dominique
<br>Noguez. No text has one single author. Whether we are conscious of
it or not, we
<br>always write on top of a palimpsest (cf. Duncan's "grand
collage").
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a question of linear "influence,"
but
of writing as dialog with a
<br>whole net of previous and concurrent texts, tradition, with the
culture
and language
<br>we breathe and move in, which conditions us even while we help to
construct
it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us have foregrounded this awareness as
technique,
using, collaging,
<br>transforming, "translating" parts of other works.
<p>I, A WOMAN:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fact clearly shapes my writing:
thematically,
in attitude, in awareness of
<br>social conditioning, marginality--but does not determine it
exclusively.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacan is preposterous in imposing his phallic
cult
on the signifier--and in bad
<br>faith when he claims gender neutrality.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, I don't see much point in labeling
certain
forms as "feminine." (Even
<br>though I like some of the suggestions. e.g. Joan Retallack's &amp;
Luce Irigarai's that the
<br>feminine is "plural," comprising all forms that conspire against
against
monolithic,
<br>monotonal, monolinear <i>uni</i>verses.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really see "female language," "female
style
or technique." Because the
<br>writer, male or female, is only one partner in the process of
writing.
Language, in its full
<br>range, is the other. And it is not a language women have to "steal
back" (Ostriker). The
<br>language a poet enters into belongs as much to the mothers as to
the
fathers.
<p>COMMUNICATION:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In crossing the Atlantic my phonemes settled
somewhere
between German and
<br>English. I speak either language with an accent. This has saved me
the illusion of being
<br>the master of language. I enter it at a skewed angle, through the
fissures,
the slight
<br>difference.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not "use" the language. I interact with
it.
I do not communicate <i>via</i> language,
<br>but <i>with</i> it. Language is not a tool for me, but a medium
infinitely
larger thatn any intention.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will find resonance is out of my hands. If
the poem works (and gets the chance
<br>to be read) it will set off vibrations in the reader, an
experience
with language --with the
<br>way it defines us as human beings. Walter Benjamin: "Art posits
man's
physical and
<br>spiritual existence, but in none of its works is it concerned with
his response. No poem is
<br>intended for the reader, no picture for the beholder, no symphony
for
the listener."
<p>MEANING, especially DEEPER:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I am saying here is on the surface, which is
all we can work on. I like the image in
<br><i>Don Quixote</i> that compares translation to working on a
tapestry:
you sit behind it, with a
<br>mess of threads and a pattern for each color, but have no idea of
the
image that will
<br>appear on the other side.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This holds for writing as well. We work on
technical
aspects, on the craft. We make
<br>a pattern that works, coheres. Our obsessions and preoccupations
find
their way into it
<br>no matter what we do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what the poem will "mean" is a different
matter.
I can only hope that it gives a
<br>glimpse of that unreachable goal (which, paradoxically, is also
its
matrix), the
<br>concentration, the stillness of those moments when it seems we're
taken
out of ourselves
<br>and out of time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoreau: "Nothing is worth saying, nothing is
worth
doing except as a foil for the
<br>waves of silence to break against."
<p>II. PRACTICE:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I don't even have thoughts, I have methods that make language think,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
take over and me by the hand. Into sense or offense, syntax stretched
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
across rules, relations of force, fluid the dip of the plumb line,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the pull of eyes..."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(<i>A Form/ Of Taking/ It All</i>)
<p>1.&nbsp; EXPLORING THE SENTENCE:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tension of line and sentence. But especially
the sentences. Erosion of their
<br>borders. Sliding them together, towards a larger (total?)
connectedness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both in <i>The Aggressive Ways of the Casual
Stranger</i>
and in <i>The Road Is</i>
<br><i>Everywhere</i> <i>or</i> <i>Stop This Body</i> I worked on
making
the object of one phrase flip
<br>over into being the subject of the next phrase without being
repeated:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Exaggerations of a curve
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
exchanges time and again
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
beside you in the car
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pieces the road together
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with night moisture
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the force of would-be-sleep
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
beats through our bodies
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
denied their liquid depth
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
toward the always dangerous next
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dawn bleeds its sequence
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of ready signs
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The target was strictly grammatical. Consciously
I was pushing at the boundaries
<br>of the sentence. I was interested in having a flow of a
quasi-unending
sentence play
<br>against the short lines that determine the rhythm. So, on one
level,
I was simply
<br>exacerbating the tension between sentence and line that is there
is
all verse. And
<br>since the thematic field is cars and other circulation systems
(blood,
breath, sex,
<br>economics, language, a set of metaphors never stated, but made
structural)
I liked
<br>the effect of hurtling down main clause highway at breakneck
speed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only later, that I realized that this
challenge
to a rigid subject-object
<br>relation has feminist implications. Woman in our culture has been
treated
as object
<br>par excellence, to be looked at rather than looking, to be loved
and
done to rather
<br>than doing.&nbsp; Instead, these poems propose a grammar in which
subject
and object
<br>function are not fixed, but reversible roles, where there is no
hierarchy
of main and
<br>subordinate clauses, but a fluid and constant alternation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, though, I began to long for
subordinate
clauses, complex sentences.
<br>So I turned to writing prose poems. I became fascinated by
Wittgenstein
and by
<br>the form of the proposition because of its extreme closure. This
was
a challenge
<br>because my previous poems had mostly worked toward opening the
boundaries
of
<br>the sentence, either by sliding sentences together or by
fragmentation.
I tried to work
<br>with this challenge, accept the complete sentence (most of the
time)
and try to
<br>subvert its closure and logic from the inside, by constantly
sliding
between frames of
<br>reference. I especially brought the female body in and set into
play
the old gender
<br>archetypes of logic and mind being "male," whereas "female"
designates
the illogical:
<br>emotion, body, matter. Again, I hope that the constant sliding
challenges
these
<br>categories.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"You took my temperature which I had meant to save for a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
more difficult day"&nbsp; (R.W., <i>The Reproduction of Profiles</i>,
23)
<p>2. FRAGMENTS:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Isogrammatical lines connecting the mean incidence of comparable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
parts of speech map the discourses of the world, I say. Against their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
average, extremes of sense and absence create the pleasure of
fragments.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Break the silence and pick up the pieces to find a cluster of shards
which
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
catches lighton the cut and the next day too."&nbsp; (<i>A Form/ Of
Taking/
It All</i>)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This glint of light on the cut, this spark given
off by the edges is what I am after.
<br>Juxtaposing, rather than isolating, minimal units of meaning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the break of linearity. When the smooth
horizontal
travel of eye/mind is
<br>impeded, when the connection is broken, there is a kind of
orchestral
meaning that
<br>comes about in the break, a vertical dimension made up of the
energy
field between
<br>the two lines (or phrases or sentences). A meaning that both
connects
and illuminates
<br>the gap, so that the shadow zone of silence between the elements
gains
weight,
<br>becomes an element of the structure.

a not yet open door
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
precisely: an occasion
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jab&egrave;s, like the German Romantics, holds
that the
fragment is our only access to
<br>the infinite. I tend to think it is our way of apprehending
anything.
Our inclusive
<br>pictures are mosaics.
<p>3. COLLAGE, or, THE SPLICE OF LIFE:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned to collage early, to get away from
writing
poems about my
<br>overwhelming mother. I felt I needed to do something "objective"
that
would get me
<br>out of myself. I took books off the shelf, selected maybe one word
from every page
<br>or a phrase every tenth page, and tried to work these into
structures.
Some worked,
<br>some didn't. But when I looked at them a while later: they were
still
about my mother.
<br>(As Tristan Tzara would have predicted. His recipe for making a
Dadaist
poem by
<br>cutting up a newspaper article ends with: "The poem will resemble
you.")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a revelation--and a liberation. I
realized
that subject matter is not something
<br>to worry about. Your concerns and obsessions will surface no
matter
what you do.
<br>This frees you to work on form, which is all one can work on
consciously.
For the rest,
<br>all you can do is try to keep your mind alive, your curiosity and
ability
to see.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more important was the second revelation:
that
any constraint stretches the
<br>imagination, pull you into semantic fields different from the one
you
started with. For
<br>though the poems were still about my mother, something else was
also
beginning to happen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Georges Braque: "You must always have 2 ideas,
one
to destroy the other. The painting
<br>is finished when the concept is obliterated."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Barbara Guest would qualify that the
constraints
must be such that they stretch the
<br>imagination without disabling it.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collage, like fragmentation, allows you to
frustrate
the expectation of continuity,
<br>of step-by-step-linearity. And if the fields you juxtapose are
different
enough there
<br>are sparks from the edges. Here is a paragraph from <i>A Key Into
the
Language of America</i>
<br>that tries to get at the clash of Indian and European cultures by
juxtaposing
phrases
<br>from Roger William's 1743 treatise with contemporary elements from
anywhere
<br>in my Western heritage.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>OF MARRIAGE</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Flesh, considered as cognitive region, as opposed to undifferentiated
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
warmth, is called woman or wife. <b>The number not stinted, yet
the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Narragansett (generally) have but one</b>. While diminutives are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
coined with reckless freedom, the deep structure of the marriage bed



<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is universally esteemed even in translation. <b>If the woman be
false</b>
to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bedlock, <b>the offended husband will be solemnly avenged</b>, arid
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and eroded. He may remove her clothes at any angle between horizontal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
planes.
<p>4. "TRANSLATION:"
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this I mean taking some one aspect of an
existing
work and translating it into
<br>something else. For instance, <i>When They Have Senses</i> uses
the
grammatical
<br>structure of Anne-Marie Albiach's E<i>tat</i> as a matrix, much in
the way poets used
<br>to use a metrical scheme. It was an additional challenge that
E<i>tat</i>
is in French, so
<br>that the grammatical patterns did not work very well in English
and
thus had a
<br>built-in push beyond themselves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example closer to home is <i>Differences for
Four Hands</i>. This sequence began
<br>with following the sentence structure of Lyn Hejinian's prose poem
<i>Gesualdo</i>
and
<br>"translating" it into a kind of invocation of Clara and Robert
Schumann.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the finished version this is not all that
easy
to trace any more. Hejinian's sentence
<br>is much more quirky than what I ended up with, because I needed
something
closer
<br>to the tension between fluidity and stillness that's
characteristic
for Schumann's music.
<br>And a sentence about the increasing number of children:
"Run. Three
children through
<br>the house." "Run. Five children through the house." became a kind
of
refrain or
<br>ostinato which changes the structural feel. But here is a passage
which
has remained
<br>quite close:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hejinian, <i>Gesualdo</i>:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two are extremes. You place on noble souls. The most important was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
an extraordinary degree. What has been chosen from this, but a regular
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
process of communication, shortly implored for long life and
forgiveness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You are a target of my persuasion. I am overlooking the city. At times
I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
am most devout and at others most serene, and both pleasure and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
displeasure haunt me. My heart is not above the rooftops.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<i>Differences for Four Hands</i>:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any two are opposite. You walk on sound. The coldest wind blows
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the edges of fear. Which has been written down. Passion's not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
natural. But body and soul are bruised by melancholy, fruit of dry,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
twisted riverbeds. Loss discolors the skin. At times you devour
apples,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
at others bite into your hand.
<p>5. RHYTHM:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhythm is the elusive quality without which
there
is no poem, without which
<br>the most interesting words remain mere words on paper, remain
verse.
"Upper limit
<br>music, lower limit speech" said Zukofsky. xxxck Rhythm, I mean,
not
meter. It is
<br>hard to talk about, impossible to pin down. It is the truly
physical
essence of the
<br>poem, determined by the rhythms of my body, my breath, my
pulse. But
it is also
<br>the alternation of sense and absence, sound and silence. It
articulates
the between,
<br>the difference in repetition.
<p>6. REVISIONS:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think on paper, revise endlessly. I am envious
of a poet like Duncan who has
<br>such absolute confidence that anything that comes to him is right.
"Speaking in the
<br>God-Voice" I heard him call it. "Of course," he added, "if you
speak
in the
<br>God-Voice you say an awful lot of stupid things!" More important
to
me: he
<br>considered new poems his revisions (re-visions) of the old ones
--this
is beautiful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I feel closer to what John Ashbery said in
conversation
with Kenneth Koch,
<br>that he feels any line could have been written some other way,
that
it doesn't
<br>necessarily have to sound as it does.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am slow and need to think about things a long
time,
need to hold on to the
<br>trace on paper. Thinking is adventure. Does adventure need to be
speedy?
Perhaps
<br>revising is a way of refusing closure? Not wanting to come to
rest?
