<font size=6 color=salmon>A New Installation by Cecilia Vicu&ntilde;a</font><br>
<font size=5 color=gray>September 26-November 7, 1998</font><br><br>

Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center, DiverseWorks ArtSpace (Houston),
and Art in General (NYC) have jointly developed a touring solo
exhibition of the work of internationally recognized Chilean
visual artist and poet Cecilia Vicuna. Vicuna will exhibit pivotal
historical works along with three installations designed specifically
for the three organizations and their environments. Her exhibition
in Buffalo will be accompanied by a reading sponsored by just
buffalo literary center. This multi-state consortium project
has received major support from the National Endowment for the
Arts, a federal agency. The exhibition as a whole takes a layered,
archaeological approach to this artist and poet who weaves across
barriers and between media, (particularly between visual art
and language). Her work is a powerful fusion of a knowledge of
a colonial Chilean and local Andean culture and the quest for
a global avant-garde. As we approach the beginning of a new millennium,
such union of seeming oppositions is an artistic pursuit, as
well as an intercultural conversation that will have a profound
impact on world culture and create new ways of engaging with
knowledge. In one of her first spatial works titled El Khipu
que no ne recuerda nada (The Khipu that Remembers Nothing, 1965)
she outlined a bare thread around her own bedroom. A khipu is
an Incan instrument consisting of knotted woolen cords that registered
events and numerals. This form of recording was used to the first
period of the conquista, replaced later by written systems. The
entire khipu contains meaning: length, form color, number of
knots, knots which were endlessly tied and retied, a means of
inscribing that is never fixed. The act of doing and undoing
offers many beginnings and endings, and many pathways in between.
In a 1994 outdoor weaving, 12 hilos en un corral (The Corral
Grid), a grid of string crosses a mestizo trapezoid-shaped corral,
a space surrounded by an ancient wall that is regularly repaired
with new stones as the old ones crumble. Works such as this establish
a profound connection between processes of working the loom and
working the earth, both providing necessities of life such as
food and clothing. Words in the language of Quechua (spoken by
4 million people in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Argentina) is
telling of this connection. Pampa is both an agricultural plain
and large single-color sections of textiles. Khata is both a
furrowed field ready for planting as well as the warp ready to
be worked upon. Weaving and agriculture are entwined in language.
The warp and woofs are open, close to the ground, protective.
The grid of thread mimics the archaeological method for site
mapping. In Western culture, it is also a tool used since the
Renaissance to master three dimensional space on a two-dimensional
plane. In Andean and other ancient cultures, the grid is the
fundamental structure upon which all architecture and weaving
is based. 12 hilos en el corral suggests the overlay of modernism
and Andean culture, in a new complex whole. In her projects for
Art in General, DiverseWorks, and Hallwalls, Vicuna will create
mappings that are particular to the cities and the spaces in
which these organizations are located (a manufacturer of hardware,
a cotton warehouse, a factory for Model-T Fords). Vicuna has
been commissioned to create a new work which will be exhibited
in conjunction with earlier works, creating a context for her
current activity. Vicuna will participate in just buffalo literary
center's education programming in the Buffalo public schools.
She will return to Buffalo in early October to present a series
of workshops. (Watch Hallwalls' October calendar for details.)
Hallwalls, Art in General and DiverseWorks will collaborate with
the artist on a post-exhibition publication documenting the entire
three city project. The Buffalo presentation of Vicuna's work
is co sponsored by just buffalo literary center and El Museo
Francisco Oller y Diego Rivera. The exhibition is available for
touring to other cities. Born in 1948 in Chile, Cecilia Vicuna
is a visual artist, performance artist, and poet. Her work has
been exhibited in Latin American Video at The Museum of Modern
Art in New York in 1981, The Decade Show at the New Museum in
1990, the Center for Contemporary Arts in Santa Fe, N.M., the
Royal Museum in Antwerp, the Museum of Fine Arts in Santiago,
and the University Art Museum in Berkeley. Recent major exhibitions
include INside the VISIBLE : An Elliptical Traverse of 20th Century
Art: in, of, and from the Feminine (which traveled to the ICA,
Boston, The National Museum of Women, and the Whitechapel Art
Gallery in London) and the 1997 Whitney Museum of American Art
Biennial. Currently an exhibition of her work is being circulated
by the Kanaal Art Foundation, Belgium, which also co-published
a book devoted to her work titled The Precarious, The Art and
Poetry of Cecilia Vicuna, (Wesleyan University Press, l997).
In 1996 she received the Pollock Krasner Award, and The Fund
for Poetry Award. She is the author of many books, including
Unraveling Words &amp; TheWeaving of Water (Graywolf Press) and
Word
&amp; Thread (Morning Star Publications). Her poems have been
included in Poems for the Millennium Vol. II, (University of
California Press) Veinticinco Anos de Poesia Chilena, (Fondo
de Cultura Economica, Chile) and You Can't Drown the Fire, Latin
American Women Writing in Exile, (Cleis Press). She reads and
performs from her work extensively throughout Europe, North and
South America. Vicuna lives and works in New York and Chile.
Her work is accesible on the World Wide Web at the EPC.</font>
