The reference in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Folha</i> was to the A
Proto-Anthology of Hypermedia Poetry I edited and published on the World Wide
Web in 1996, which has a winding story to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Proto-Anthology stemmed from a paper I gave (Hypermedial
Art:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interacting with Hypertext
Literature) at a festival of Russian and American Poetry at Stevens Institute
of Technology, which was published later that year in the journal <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Talisman</i> (with the title you refer to)
and also on a cd-rom in Germany called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Of(f)
the W.W.Web </i>(coupled with another WWW hypertext essay Multimedia
Effects:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>American Poetry Layered Since
Black Mountain into <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Poetry Webs 1996</i>).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The day after I returned from the festival I
was going to e-mail the lecture to some friends and realized it instead could
be made into a substantive hypertext using menus with multiple links for each
pertinent reference, and could be somewhat interactive by encouraging and
inviting reader feedback.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was
exciting to produce, also laborious:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
was not using anyone elses model and it involved the compilation of dozens of files.<span

its own and many people who found it via search engine did contribute links and
use it as a reference point for teaching.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>From this point onward I came into contact with like-minded scholars
from a range of disciplines around the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It probably remains my most widely read work and regrettably that the
site has not had a firm URL and the link up-keep it requires to remain
vibrant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That the ideas and content are
strong enough to withstand technological or formal developments that have come
since is gratifying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The general perspective
I had then still more or less does pertain to the strands of digital poetry
recently outlined by Miekal And after the E-Poetry 2003 festival (programming,

hypermedia, hypertext, and network hypermedia are essentially all the same, and
hypercard (as John Cayley pointed out when I made the Proto- Anthology) is
going to be either hypertext or hypermedia and as a particular piece of
software does not need a category of its own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The outline Ive been working with in recent years, which grew out of
this earlier work, includes:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>1.)
Graphical poetry, driven by visual aspects of the interface or images that may
be mapped/linked to connected materials (thus also hypermedia); 2.) Animated or
Kinetic poetry (also graphical), where several screens are programmed to create
a sense of movement in or through the text; 3.) Videographic poetry, relying in
part or whole on digitized video; 4.) Collaborative poetry of all types; 5.)
Computer-aided or generated compositions; 6.) Text-based hyperlinked poetry;
7.) Audio poetry; and 8.) Code as poetry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

of these practices often occur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
mentioned above the areas delineated via the E-Poetry group, and while I have
questions about some of the specifics within those broad classifications coined
by And, the areas of investigation are akin to the way I see it and make
sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The genre is a plurality.<span

appropriately) a range of perspectives and lenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:

build a general context for the uninitiated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I do think it would be instructive, however, as I suggested in the
observations in my Report on E-Poetry 2003 (see http://www.wepress.org/epoetry/report.html),
to collaboratively create some sort of Index of Cyberpoetic Forms that names

transcript of a session on an Internet MOO (MOO is the online text-based
&quot;virtual reality&quot; system where many people connect to a common

dialog).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since MOOs operate with an
entirely different set of syntactical and formal conventions and are co-written

uses the term cyberpoetry throughout his book, arguing creatively about its
merits and whether it exists or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
is clear about the meaning for what he calls Computer Poetry, and that is
when a computer program (algorithm) converts words or phrases from a database
into poetry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As for cyberpoetry,
Stefans claims he can, define it only in negatives: (1) the lack of limitation
to black and white words on a page, (2) the lack of the possibility for
mechanical reproduction (there being no original), (3) the lack of closure and
the lack of choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first half of
the third of these qualities is easily disposed of.<span style="mso-spacerun:

strong, refreshingly critical views on the form (many are presented
satirically) and I hope his book, another alternative to the viewpoints that
weve been talking about, is widely read.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In my book cyberpoetry is presented as a generality at the beginning,
and is represented as something else after an understanding of the history and
dynamics of the form is presented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
use it as a convenient, non-binding label and still remain apathetic about
establishing a singular conception of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

began before the WWW became popular, circulating via email list, usenet, and
listserver between 1994 and 1996 (archives on the Electronic Poetry Center).<span

illustrate via creative example the limitations of ordinary/standard academic
discourse by setting up this imaginary universe (or university etc.) that
had no central location but the Net, and no named authors.<span

content-driven, interactive seminar forty five issues were produced before we
moved on to other projects (like our dissertations!).<span style="mso-spacerun:

from Ben Friedlander (who was a major contributor), excising the weak work and
ordering selections from the hundreds of pages of text circulated in DIU along
with a lengthy essay and other commentary about the project.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Id very much like to see it published
because it presents a different angle on the aesthetics of contemporary poetics.<span

that it drew from so many sources and disciplines, some of which are
unidentifiable, and I havent had any success with the publishers who have seen
it so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I am glad all of the work is

Thanks to my parents interests, I have been a musician, writer, photographer
and performer since childhood, and started as a publisher since 1986, so my
involvement with digital technology follows years of work as an analog
artist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was doing many of the same
types of things prior to the time I started arranging work for the screen or projection.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once I learned how to use hardware and
software (which takes time away from writing) certain aspects of my work became
extended and in some ways easier to conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Much of the text in my cyberpoetry work thus far begins as poetry (or,
as in the case of the MOO work, collaborative writing), which I then add sonic
and visual elements to for presentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Though I have done several types of experimental digital work, I like to
produce multimedia settings that compliment and augment the writing and become
an additional vehicle for transforming whatever performative space is being
used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What is different when I make
poetry in a computer?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes when I
type a poem the digital thesaurus in Microsoft Word finds better words than
ones my brain comes up with but thats probably not what you mean.<span

section of MOBY  DICK, the generated versions are sometimes (but not always)
better than the original acrostics I created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Randomization and text-generation (as in the cybertext version of the
same piece) are two major areas that cyberpoets have investigated over the past
forty years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For me, though, the
ability to integrate media and its function as a communication/publishing
device make the computer a useful tool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

to be able to interact with what they are looking at, rather than have
something projected at them (the TV/Video paradigm).<span style="mso-spacerun:

1991 interview, when I asked him to elaborate on the specifics of his artistic
lineage, If I start naming them Ill name all day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Numerous people and ideas have captivated and instructed me at different
times in every medium that Ive been involved with.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Pretty much every book, person or thing I come into contact with
becomes an influence of one kind or another, and not just artistically but in
how I live and view life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Techniques
from diverse expressive and contemplative forms have effected me:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>music, musical groups, dance, visual arts,
architecture, Buddhism, clothing design, photography, and all kinds of writing
have made an impact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a former
athlete I have no problem with the idea of having a coach.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My friends and people close to me have been
the best guides and most influential, which makes sense since supposedly I am a
fire stealer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Isnt there always more
to know?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I keep my mind as open as
possible, tolerate what needs to be tolerated, and partake in the sponge model
of artistry:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>absorb and absorb and
absorb and then squeeze out as desired or needed, bringing your own of it into
the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This approach usually leads
one to take in many influences, and not necessarily good ones!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trick is to try to learn from
everything, no?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was always interested
in the connection between music (sound) and language, and have been motivated
by many others who have explored that intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>When I was a teenager the first poets that altered my world were
the English Romantics and British pre-, post- and punk songwriters.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In college, Robert Creeley and William
Carlos Williams became models, then beat poetry, dada and other experimental
forms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like studying at Naropa five
years earlier, reading Kamau Brathwaites 1991 interview in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hambone</i> was especially instructive as it
called into question so many of my suppositions about poetry and made me want
to know much more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This led me to
become absorbed in his vastly informed work and entirely new (to me) strands of
heterogeneous writing with global orientation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After a few years of investigation I collaborated with Brathwaite to
publish of one of his books (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ConVERSations
with Nathaniel Mackey</i>, 1999).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most
universities are very conservative, mine was; there are significant limits to
what sorts of literature a typical education provides.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It takes a while to get to know whats out
there and is difficult to keep up with it all once you know it because something
new always arises in addition to what youre catching up with!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the computer has become a considerable
tool, Ive been less influenced by page-oriented poets and look to those
artists that work to one way or another unite multiple forms, whether digitally
or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I learned a lot from the New
Media Poetry edition of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Visible Language</i>
that Eduardo Kac edited, but overall I dont think any of the cyberpoets are
directly influential on me, even though some of the works and philosophies from
pioneers in the field have been inspiring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We do what we do making it up from or approaching it with our individual
dispositions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The one thing that
hopefully brings us together is that were involved with cultural production
rather than cultural destruction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have touched on much of my work in poetry and computers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only project major project not taken up
that was mentioned a couple of times is Purkinge (and related Albany-based
projects).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1990 Don Byrd began
organizing collaborative writing sessions (known as The Awopbop Groupuscle) for
poets in a networked computer lab.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Using the InterChange program on a Daedalus system, countless poems and
stories were composed (multi-authored, in real-time) over the next four
years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was joining this group on a
visit to Albany in 1991 that prompted me to want to study there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had always written collaboratively with
friends, and figured if such unusual projects were afoot with poets involved
that I should consider returning to graduate school after a six-year
haitus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At first the group was large,
and included many excellent writers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By
the time I got there in 1992, the size of the group had dwindled as some people
got their degrees and others lost interest for various reasons.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The even smaller group that was left by 1993
(Sandy Baldwin, Belle Gironda, Eric Douglas and myself) decided to call
ourselves Purkinge (the name taken from a Czech physician who studied the
brain).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We started publishing our
jointly written poems, invented irreverent presentations for academic
conferences, wrote theory for the work, and performed together.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the last six months that the group
thrived (1994) we abandoned writing and spontaneously composed our works using
audio recording equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had
generated so much text together on the page (which we closely edited for
performance) that we felt we could dispense with the screen and page altogether
and it worked very well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We put a lot
of thought into developing our performances, and always included audience
participation (interactivity).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is
where I learned that audiences dont always want to be interactive, though also
confirmed that when they are it can be magical.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>At our peak we managed to convince a huge audience at a rocknroll
festival (Lollapalooza) to jam along with us and our soundtrack after handing
out hundreds of drumsticks we had cut from dowel rods.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We strapped folding metal chairs ourselves
and slam-danced which got their attention and riled them up, </span>creating a
wild atmosphere and energy in which<br>
to present language<span style='color:black'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Baldwin and Douglas left in the fall of 1994 and the project ended until
2000, when Byrd and Derek Owens suggested that we should virtually re-form as
Nine Way Mind (nine people were involved) for E-Poetry 2001.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We prepared via online chat, writing
sessions and posting and exchanging files via the Internet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I mixed a sixty minute soundtrack for the
event, to which we added readings (from text and improvisation), live
music/sound, video feedback, two video projections (using video and flash),
movement, body painting, and other sensory amplification.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was over-the-top, a total overload.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some people really liked it, others didnt
at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was at the end of a long day
of panels and readings and we went on too long (though it was the length of the
time of the slot we were given).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since
that point the group has dissolved again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Earlier this month I was reviewing some recordings by Purkinge for a
sound poetry cd in Spain, and ended up producing a group of tracks into an EP
(extended play or electronic poetry) project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Weve talked about getting together to review, organize, and design a cd
set of the groups audio work, and maybe at some point well do the same with
the thousands of pages of written texts I have in a box in my basement
too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Net holds great potential for
online group composition, and Im surprised at the small proportion of that
type of work happening these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Part
of the problem, I am sure, is that everyone is too busy to take on the demands
of serious collaboration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Writing and
research, families and other needs fully occupy our time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These are things that curb my participation
in much virtual discourse, despite my interest in it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
