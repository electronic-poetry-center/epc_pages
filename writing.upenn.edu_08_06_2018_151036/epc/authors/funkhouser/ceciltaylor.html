<blockquote>Pianist-composer Cecil Taylor is internationally known for the 
brilliance and audacious beauty of his music. He has recorded dozens of albums 
as a solo performer and with various ensembles over a period spanning five 
decades. He is currently working with a large ensemble called Phthongos. 
He has incorporated poetry into his work in a number of ways over the years;
in 1991 Leo Records released <i>Chinampas</i>, a recording which presents his
poetry accompanied by multi-instrumental improvisations.
The following interview, conducted by Chris Funkhouser, took
place at Mr. Taylor's 
home in Brooklyn on September 3, 1994.</blockquote>

<p>
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Let's explore the literary side of the work 
that you do. With the exceptions of people like Sun Ra, 
Archie Shepp, and a few others, there aren't many jazz 
players who choose to work with words as a mode of 
expression. I wanted to ask you about your poetry, where 
you're coming from when you write it down or are 
presenting it vocally. 
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, I don't know what jazz is. And what most 
people think of as jazz I don't think that's what it is at all. As 
a matter of fact I don't think the word has any meaning at 
all, but that's another conversation...
<p>
It seems to me that one of the things that is true with 
every--oh, for instance--like this Irish writer, William 
Kennedy. In reading some of his stories about life, his family 
members in Albany--the thing that struck me, the 
similarity, and the things that makes human beings who are 
vital electric, is the way they use language to manifest their 
live responses to the culture that they are in. So I got that 
from that. In a way, in its own way, it's like when I was very 
young I read Langston Hughes' Simple stories and it 
whetted my appetite for the possibility of using language to 
move outside of the self. 
<p>
One of the most important things that happened to me, 
really--I've always had difficulty with teachers in school. 
Right after Pearl Harbor I wrote this poem about December 
8th--I don't even know why I remember this--and the 
teacher said, "Oh, that's a very bad poem." Well, I knew that 
I should write poetry then. If she said it was bad, then it 
must be okay.
<p>
When I was in the Conservatory, there was a Southern 
woman who taught English the first year that I was there. 
English--well, English--American language is quite different, 
actually. She was talking about Tennessee Williams, and she 
was talking about <i>Streetcar</i>, and she said, 'The language in that 
play...there are sections of that play that are so good,' she 
said,'...that I could actually taste it.' And that was one of the 
most remarkable things that happened to me in the whole 
four years that I was at the Conservatory. Cause I only had 
three teachers, really, that were interesting, and all three 
of them were women. I was sixteen when that was said to 
me, and I remember of course when <i>Streetcar</i> was on 
Broadway--I certainly didn't see it, but I did see Talleulah 
Bankhead do it years later--this was a time when I was in a 
new environment for me. A new musical community 
environment, The New England Conservatory [laughs], 
and whatever that was about. But I was also at that point 
beginning to construct certain things musically. I was 
beginning to. And because what was important about this 
English woman--this English teacher--I wish I could 
remember her name cause I can see her--and what she 
gave to me--because she gave it in a not punitive way. 
Mother always had me reading. Mother spoke French and 
German and brought Shopenhauer to me when I was 
eleven years old, but that was something else--that was--
you didn't have a choice there with mother. Boom! That's 
the way that went. But here was this woman who just said 
this, and it I heard it. And her emotional dedication to a 
word--I said, "Wow...that's my dedication to music...you mean it 
is possible to have that kind of dedication to another art?" 
So, that. 
<p>
I never understood how musicians could play music for 
poets and not read poems. I don't understand musicians 
who can play for dancers and not know how to dance. I 
mean, it's very interesting to me, you were talking about 
your research; well, one of the things--before I put words 
down, I probably have read a thousand words.
<p>
I have a lot of interests. Dance is certainly one. 
Architecture, particularly structural engineers. I look at 
basketball. I'm not interested in it though. I love horses, 
horseracing. I've never seen a horse race. I can remember 
Sea Biscuit and those things, though. I used to run when I 
was young. I do all these exercises everyday.   
<p>
I did write a poem about Nureyev, when I saw him dance. 
I also wrote a poem about Albert Ayler, too. I think that for 
me the idea is to--I mean it changes, you know, every ten 
years or so--but right now I'm going through this whole 
thing about making these belated discoveries about mother 
dear. And what that really means is these few years that I 
have left here to really deal with a certain kind of upward-
mobile bourgeoisie nonsense that entrapped a lot of--but 
anyway, the poetry saved my life, actually. 
<p>
If you have the opportunity to play for people all in 
different countries, one of the things you begin to discover 
is that people are--you can find oppressed people all over 
the world, therefore somewhere along the road you get the 
idea that it is certainly not about yourself. Any gift that you 
have is not about that at all. It's about a force that is about 
the ungiven, the uncreative. It is about the amorphous, and 
you are at best merely a vessel. And once you begin to 
understand that [laughs]--the wonderful thing about it 
is--I was thinking about it today--that the first time I heard 
Billie Holiday, I heard it in the room of a member of the 
family who was not very well thought of, and the other part 
of the family all liked Bing Crosby. And that was alright, but 
there is a qualitative difference. So in our small way what 
we attempt to do is to look and see and receive and become a 
sponge and attempt to make anything that exists as part of 
the palette to describe whatever it is we think we want to 
do. And what you want to do is to be as beautiful and as 
loving and as all-consuming as possible, so that the 
statement has many, many different implications, and it has 
many different levels. The only way to do that, seems to me, 
is to research. 
<p>
I think what my mother did give me unquestionably was 
that--maybe she didn't quite perceive it this way but--it is 
wonderful to be able to enjoy what it is I do now as opposed 
to the disciplinary aura that I had to grow up under. Now I 
do what I want to do because I love doing it, and it rewards 
me and I've been fortunate in that I've been told that other 
people have gotten something from what it is. It is possible 
to do what it is you decide you want to do with your life. For 
me that has been the thing that has cured whatever 
despondency, whatever anger, you know...well, that's that.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  You couldn't have been very old when you 
wrote a poem about Pearl Harbor--so you've been writing 
from elementary school onward?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, actually, you know teachers--I ran into a lot 
of teachers where it was very clear to me that if you didn't 
do what they told you to do, they would try to stop you 
from doing anything at all. That's what that teachers do. 
When I went to the Conservatory, it was the same thing, 
and boy did I fight with those people up there. Actually, I 
can tell you when I started writing but that wouldn't be 
very interesting, cause that was all about romance. And of 
course that's what it is about, isn't it? But I really started 
writing in 1962 when I went to Europe for the first time. I 
was writing letters to this poet, who I was quite taken with 
at the time. That's when I started writing.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  You were playing before that. Was there a 
point where the writing and playing began to coincide 
somehow? I know I've seen you perform and it's chanting, and 
all sorts of...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  That's the wonderful thing about maybe never 
being allowed to get into the business--the music business--
because I was not a very well-behaved person according to 
the gangsters who control the business. I'm lucky to be 
alive, really. So what you had to do--and also the fact that 
what I was doing was considered not very viable. [Laughs] 
That's a cute word to mean it didn't make any money, or 
they didn't see how they could make any money. And they 
would tell you what you were supposed to do. That's the 
way they are. So, not being malleable that way, the 
resources that my mother and father gave me, since I 
didn't have any money--but my father would always give 
me money. When I wasn't working I always went to see 
plays on Broadway. Then years later, this woman that I was 
sort of involved with worked at the Living Theater. So I got a 
whole new concept, and a whole new thrust of beauty right 
there, you see. And actually I ran into Baraka around '57. 
So, what I mean is that one dedication leads to another, 
especially if it is very important for you to continue to grow, 
especially when they tell you that "We're not going to allow 
you to grow in this area." So what does that mean? Meant I 
had to practice at home. It also meant that I had to look 
around for other sources of beauty that could aid in what I 
was doing with the main thing. Then finally, you see, these 
things mesh, and it takes a while for it to happen. But then, 
you know, it does. 
<p>
And so therefore there is no possible way that I can have 
any regrets about not working, where these other people 
did. Cause I was always working. I just didn't make any 
money. [Laughter]
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  You said poetry saved your life . . .
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Yes it did. I had one or two friends that helped. But 
the work always brought me back. For instance, this work 
that I'm working on now, which has a lot to do with my 
mother, actually, and my relationship to her as a property 
of hers. Unwanted property, it seemed to me, possibly. I 
mean I have to think of that as a certain reality because of 
her attempts to kill me at a certain point. Literally. However, 
the fantastic thing about all of this is that if you survive, 
then you understand that your parents had parents too. 
And that must have been a trip. The extraordinary anger 
that I began to see that was in my family, and resulted in, 
really, her death at the age of thirty-four, and the death of 
all people in the family who followed her conception of 
living, because she was very powerful and very persuasive. 
And there were at least three people in the family who died 
of cancer at the age of thirty-four. Given the fact that she 
had been in silent movies, and that she recited poetry, and 
that she'd walk into a room and the room would stop--but 
then she found father, and father was from North Carolina, 
and he was an agricultural person and she was his dream. 
She could speak French and German, she knew how to wear 
clothes, and all of that shit. And then she stopped because 
we had the only brick house--there were only two brick 
houses on the block--and pop owned one. She became the 
lady of the manor. And I became her--so I was tapdancing 
when I was six. I was entering contests for young 
virtuosos--I was never a young virtuoso--but she tried to 
make me--so I was playing Chopin when I was six and all this 
nonsense. And I was driven. There was no--I was telling 
someone the other night, I said, 'I've never--I could not be 
idle'--you had to be doing something. And so of course, she 
died when I was eleven, twelve--twelve, yeah--and I had a 
peptic ulcer when I was thirteen. It was just a glorious 
experience growing up in her house. However, she gave me 
certain things. She was the eldest of six children, after all; 
her mother was Cherokee. Her father was never mentioned. 
Father's father--he had a great deal of problems with him--
he was Kiowa. And all of this I had to discover, and this is 
the language of--the language of the word is now coming to 
deal with all of that.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Is it much different than what you were 
doing with <i>Chinampas</i>, where you were going back to 
another set of . . .
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, <i>Chinampas</i> is about those extraordinary 
Aztecs. You see, the Aztecs, you might say, are my distant 
relatives too because there is Kiowa and Cherokee. So we're 
dealing with native americans, and I'm interested in--oh, 
man, the culture. Like there is an extraordinary Mexican 
structural engineer named Felix Candello, who has done this 
restaurant--his most famous work--the only one that I 
know, actually--is this restaurant that he has constructed 
outside of Mexico City. 
<p>
In order to deal with this, it becomes--there is like a 
difference between therapy, because I've been in therapy--
the last therapist I had was really very much like my 
father. He ended up in A.A., too. I don't even know whether 
he's even alive now. When you have the choice to work out 
your own, or to begin to see into your own emotional 
mechanisms, and then begin to discover who set them up 
for you, who gave you these intrapersonal tactics that keep 
you from being ever-vulnerable--and when you do it 
through your own experience and maybe you have one 
friend who does not allow you to get away with certain 
things--then there's always the whatever we are as people. 
<p>
Our work is always perhaps more whole than we, and 
when you really begin to move as a human being then you 
begin to see the disparity between what is not an 
abstraction but becomes an emotional force that is akin--it is 
the same thing as the intellectual perception, which I feel--
cause all of the most amazing poets that I've ever--and 
when I use the word poet I mean Ben Webster or Billie 
Holiday, or Maya Pelisetskaya or the incredible Carmen 
Amaya. You know, these great dancers who when you see 
them you know that that's a life, and when you look at them 
they've taken yours. Because you see them and you say, 
"Jesus, if I ever grow up that's what I'd like to do, that's 
what I'd like to give."
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  It's inside your body, something that enters 
your body, then . . .
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  A spirit! That force, you know--I realize that my 
mother had that force. But what she decided not to do with 
it--and if you have that force and you don't use it, then you 
die. Because if you kill that force your body follows 
afterwards. My uncle, her only brother, he could live in the 
house with us as long as he would not be a musician. And he 
died of cancer at the age of thirty-four. He gave me drum 
lessons.
<p>
A lot of my rage was really dealing with the hypocrisy of 
the upwardly mobile middle-class aspirations of certain 
groups of people that I grew up with. And they all--I mean 
for instance, I had a cousin who had a beautiful voice, and 
they convinced her that she was too ugly to sing! [Laughter]
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  You feel certain kinship with Aztec and the 
sensibilities that they developed? There was a group that 
ran into all kinds of trouble--and what a highly developed sense 
of spirit...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  What I am saying is two things:  because mother 
insisted that I do certain things, there was a seed so that 
when it was left up to me to find certain things, the richness 
of these other poetical universes I had already had 
reference to.
<p>
Now, I'd rather not talk about my political adventures, 
beyond saying this:  when I was very young, I went to the 
second Peekskill rally. Paul Robeson was there, [W.E.B.] 
DuBois was there, and it was in an area that my father's 
boss lived in. And what happened to me then, and I was 
thirteen--and the family read the <i>Daily News</i> at that time--
and we were lucky to get out of Peekskill alive. When I got 
back Monday and I read the <i>Daily News</i> reportage of what 
they said had happened, then I knew that I had to have 
other options because that is not what I experienced. And if 
they were going to say that that's what was happening then 
I knew that I had to choose another course.
<p>
And nothing has happened since, with the exception of 
those young adults who died at Kent State, those young 
people who forced this country to stop the Vietnamese 
massacre. But what happened to those people in twenty 
years? When the hosannas of democracy blare the loudest, 
it's when personal options--in terms of choices--become the 
narrowest. It's at that point that the poet really sees the 
dimension of the work that is possible.
<p>
So right now I'm in a very high state--and this is very 
interesting since I haven't smoked a cigarette in over a 
week and I don't know what's happening to me--and I'm 
feeling extraordinary about all of this. There's a lot--I'm 
writing a section of this piece today that I've never written 
anything quite like this before. So I don't know what's going 
on--except that it feels marvellous--and I can't believe what 
I'm seeing on television. I can't believe what I'm hearing on 
the news. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  In "Garden" one thing that begins to emerge 
from the layers and layers and layers--you invoke some 
heroic figures from black culture, the lines, "Lines 
here/have an echo in distant valleys," and then you speak 
also of "stamping/heredity to a new definition." There is a 
resonance--however one wants to interpret distant valleys--
taking things to a new place, or transformation in a larger 
sense, not necessarily a personal sense. You bring in a lot of 
things. We all know that there room for transformation:  
what fascinates me with your use of language and form of 
expression is that it is--in addition to using poetry to make 
more music, you're saying something and different tensions 
develop, different almost apocalyptic things come about--so 
you're there, you're at a certain precipice...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  The people that I love, I love. The spirits--they're 
the ones that have changed my life, and the ones that I 
really--they're here, and it would not have been that way 
had they not lived. So I always genuflect. I feel that way 
about certain writers, certain dancers, certain architects, 
certain women singers, and certain organizers of musical 
sound. I mean I remember when I saw Carmen Amaya for 
the first time. And the loveliest thing about it--when they 
built the national monument--cause she died in this villa in 
Begur, they asked me to come.
<p>
What I am doing is creating a language. A different 
American language. I feel that. Genet is fascinating because 
of the intellectual--and it wasn't for him intellectual. Then 
again, I don't make a separation between intellect and 
emotion. I think with the great artists that I love there was 
the same thing. By that I mean they had a structure, 
technique, and the thing that made the technique and the 
structure move was their passion. The thing about Le Roi 
Jones was he's never really had loving emotion. 
<p>
There's so much destruction that is going on in the world 
today--all around us--I mean this extraordinary thing with 
these--did you see where these two eleven year old children 
killed another fourteen year old--and this business--this 
Crime Bill? They don't seem to understand that they can 
build all the fuckin' prisons they want--if we don't get to the 
root of the violence that is in the air here, then it's all for 
naught. I mean, of course, Schwarzenegger is connected 
with the Kennedys, so he can make all of these violent films 
that he wants to, they're box-office and that's acceptable. 
Some of the television skits for children on tv:  it's just not 
human! So, now, what do we do? Without becoming literal 
but using imagination and creating metaphors that 
confound the senses, and that confound those who are not 
de-tuned? To disorganize one's whole apparatus in facing all 
of this, then it's possible to surprise yourself.
<p>
Obviously I'm fascinated with words. And without 
thinking of rhythm in language, but knowing that it's there, 
and reading a lot of different people, finally what happens is 
the same thing that happens when we are involved in 
music. I listen to a lot of different music. For instance, today 
I listened to Chinese Classical music--which I really didn't dig 
too much, but I'll listen to it again--I listened to Islamic 
chants that really knocked me the fuck out. And just single 
voices. I listened to Duke Ellington's Orchestra circa 1945--
there was one piece that was just amazing. I listened to 
Victoria de los Angeles singing Purcell's "Diedere and something 
or other..." and then I listened to Gary Grafman playing the 
first movement of the Brahms piano concerto. Brahms, boy 
I tell you--then I listened to Leonard T. Price singing the last 
movement of Richard Strauss' "Solome." Boy--what what a--
wheeew--boy, that guy--I have to go to see that guy. A lot of 
shit was up. And then, of course, of course--I listen every 
day to something by Ligeti. Today I heard "Ramifications" 
and this choral piece, and "Atmospheres." Then I listen 
every day to [he chuckles] Marvin Gaye, of course. Then I 
put on Sarah Vaughn, then I put on Xenakis--oh, this 
fucking guy--this orchestra piece, and then I'm--god, I mean 
I practiced the piano four hours today. I spent two hours 
completing another section of this poem this morning. I 
cooked, I mopped all the floors in this house, and I've done 
all this stuff. And not one cigarette I can't understand it. No 
champagne, anything...
<p>
But I'm onto something. I really want to surprise Min 
[Tanaka, with whom Taylor performed in NYC, 17 September, 
1994]. We'll surprise each other. I've been listening to this 
Kathleen Battle, and this guy who's the head of the Met 
Orchestra, he was interviewed by Charlie Rose the other 
day, and he said a couple of things, but anyway he's playing 
with Battle--she's singing Shubert <i>leider</i>--and she [he 
chuckles] no, it was Schumann--I don't know--Shubert, 
Schumann, whatever. Any way, boy, boy, o boy, wow--
mmm-mmm-mm. Such music. Then I listened to Billie 
Holiday singing, and I started laughing because I'm having 
such a good time. I'm not seeing many people. I crossed out 
a whole bunch of people--I do think about them--and you 
know I have all of these things that I've been doing.
<p>
After you do this a number of times, you develop a kind of 
spiritual touch. For instance, I will go into a bookstore and I 
will just stand there and I will pick out a book, manytimes, 
just because I like the way it looks. Then I might not read it 
for about five years then when I pick it up I know then why 
I bought it. And so, there are all of these different kinds of 
self-indulgences, perhaps, but anyway these great 
pleasures. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  So your expressiveness comes from these 
various architectures, histories, musicians--Marvin Gaye!
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Yeah, it comes out of all of that. All of these people. 
Marvin was an extraordinarily gifted man. All of these 
people that I'm involved in are. So you can't go wrong. I 
mean Aretha Franklin, boy, that was so great at one point. 
Oh! I listened to Etta Jones today, she was wonderful! I mean, 
you know, all of these...
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Did you talk with [Kamau] Brathwaite about 
Aretha when you saw him? He raves about "Pullin'" in 
<i>BARABAJAN POEMS</i>.
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  "Pull 'em"? 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  "Pullin'". It's some kind of train song.
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, you know, he--as a matter of fact--I was 
downstairs when he was reading [at the Naropa Institute, Summer 
1994], cause I was trying to get my nerves together. I 
mean what are you going to do when you're reading with all 
these great people? What do you do? I don't do anything. 
And all of a sudden [Anne] Waldman comes running down 
and she says, "You got to go upstairs, he's [Brathwaite] just 
reading a poem about you." I said, "I don't want to hear it--I 
mean I have to live with me, I don't need to know..." Then when I 
got up there he was talking about Billie Holiday, so that was 
great. That I can understand. 
<p>
Oh, here's another view of this building (We are looking at 
a book of [Salvador] Calatravas buildings). 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  It is incredible. Just solid. You could never 
push that down:  it probably won't crumble in an 
earthquake!
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, they know about that. Wright built that hotel 
there, and in the great earthquake that they had, when--in 
the twenties? Wright's building did not fall, and they--I 
think it's criminal what they've done to Wright's 
Guggenheim Museum. I can't bear to look at it. I mean, 
they've put this new addition. Well, I'll have to get over 
there, I suppose, and look at it. But the Japanese, they are--
the main thing about the Japanese is that they have utilized 
their cultural longevity to regenerate themselves in a way 
that spirits must regenerate in order to continue. On a 
literal level, all the techniques of American production and 
German production the Japanese have mastered. The other 
reason I think the Japanese have become the economic 
power that they've become is because we weren't given the 
correct information after the second world war. MacArthur 
and all of those people told us that they would not get rid of 
the emperor because he was a spiritual leader. Well, of 
course he was. But the other thing that they didn't tell us is 
that Hirohito owned fifty percent of all the Japanese 
industries. You're not going to... 
<p>
Then, of course, the other shit is that they were not 
allowed to indulge in the most unproductive kind of thing 
after the second world war, which is to make arms. So they 
took all of that and built this extraordinary infrastructure. I 
mean, the Japanese trains, to ride on a Bullet train--Amtrak 
is ridiculous! To ride on the French supertrain--Amtrak is 
ridiculous. Before we talk even, about the Germans, the 
infrastructure here in this country is falling down. I mean, 
every time I go over the Manhattan Bridge I'm always 
grateful that the greatest splash in the world didn't happen, 
the bridge didn't collapse. You will see, now, that the 
Manhattan Bridge--when I moved here originally, you could 
go over the top of the bridge. You could see this 
extraordinary view of lower Manhattan, with all those Wall 
Street buildings. But, more important than that is what 
happened in the American aspiration, with all of that 
business--although it's not all that. What do you think of the 
Sardabs that are in, when you think of Harmachis and you 
think of all of those monuments in Giza, and how they were 
constructed? We don't know.
<p>
But you know, there are other forces, and, you see, with 
the emergence of technology, science and technology, there 
has been the defacement of all that is spiritual. And we 
must... [laughs, pausing] So the point is that now when I 
go over the Manhattan Bridge and I'm looking at this, where 
I used to run, and had this extraordinary view before:  now 
we're down here, and they're building this shit, and over 
here you can see where they're taking part of the roadway 
off. And, you know, it's all falling. When I went by the 
Williamsburg Bridge--they've got all of that shit going on. All 
of it is going to fall into the river and there's going to be a 
great flood. And this building is not tall enough! 
<p>
Oh, and the other thing that I should show--that you've 
got to see--well, you've been to Germany, haven't you?
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Actually, I haven't . . .
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, do you know about those cable-stay box-
girder bridges? Oh, you must see them. They're the most 
extraordinary. You know, the Golden Gate and George 
Washington--that's okay--but if you have not seen a cable 
stay box-girder bridge--where are those books? Those are 
the most extraordinary bridges, and they're cheaper and 
they're stronger.  The forces of liberation during the second 
world war destroyed all the German suspension bridges, 
and all of the beam bridges. So they came up with another 
concept. 
<p>
For me it's more interesting, in a way, to look at the 
construction of bridges than it is to look at musical scores. 
Here we are. Here are the cable-stayed bridges. The first 
ones, of course, were done in Germany. The Germans also 
came up with the heliacal bridges, which the first one was 
done in 1953. And these were all over this river. I think it's 
the Rhine, too. It's an extraordinary. They come in two 
different kinds, there's the fan shape and the harp shape, 
you see. When you go into Cologne by train you'll see the 
most extraordinary. It looks like a huge piece of sculpture. 
<p>
But then, oh, boy, I wish I had that book--I don't know--I 
lost it. The Calatravas bridges. Now, Caletravas bridges--and 
his teacher, Christian Mann--he's got another conception of 
bridge building now, and roadways that we just--we just 
don't understand that shit here. Give us time, however.
<p>
Anyway, some of those pictures, they're incredible...
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  You said you're are doing a performance 
with Min Tanaka in two weeks, at the Guggenheim?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Yeah, two weeks from tonight as a matter of fact. 
Down on Mercer Street. He's going to dance. We might both 
dance, actually, even though I have this support thing here 
[on his lower leg/ankle], I'm going to do something. I am 
working it all out. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  You've worked a lot with dancers. Another 
type of movement, which relates to both your music and 
poetry.
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, you know, I think Western musicians, fine art 
musicians, what they call fine art musicians--European fine 
art--they're the only ones who don't dance. Every other--of 
course these certain stupid Americans--but you'll find in all 
other cultures, like third world cultures, musicians dance. 
What they don't understand is when you--when you are 
playing, whether you know it or not, you're dancing. I 
always got great enjoyment watching great musicians dance 
when they play. I mean, to watch Elvin Jones or Art Blakey. 
Horace Silver, Ellington had a way--and Billie Holiday--those 
movements. Or Betty Carter. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  I am interested in your connection with 
poets. What were your connections with Robert Duncan, 
and Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley, who are mentioned 
on the liner notes to <i>Nerfertiti</i>?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Those were the names that LeRoi Jones gave me 
thirty years ago, that I should read.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  And so you read them?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Oh, yes. Yeah.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Duncan's work, for instance. Some was written 
for dancers...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Wasn't Isadora his cousin or something? Yeah, I 
think she was his cousin. That wouldn't mean--yeah, I like 
Duncan very much. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  His writing I see working in cyclical and 
mythological projection in the same way that your writing 
does. I was wondering about the influences, though I know 
how difficult it is to talk about writing . . .
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  I would say that it is difficult. Do you know 
Creeley's book <i>The Island</i>? Well, I read that. The thing--
Olson, Charles Olson might be easier to talk about, or Bob 
Kaufman, but the thing that allows me to enter into what 
they do is the feeling that I get. It's the way they use words. 
It's the phraseology that they use, much the way the 
defining characteristic of men like Charlie Parker or Johnny 
Hodges is the phraseology. And in the phraseology would be 
the horizontal as well as the vertical. In other words, the 
harmony and the melodic. Well, I also see that in word 
structures. One of the things I've found maybe odd about 
Quincy Troupe was that--and you used the phrase before, 
the tensions were always the same, the ideation was always 
bracketed in a particular kind of language with no 
abatement. Always the same kind of thing. And I find that 
true in a lot of rap that I hear. But then again I don't even 
want to talk about that kind of necessarily--I mean that's 
something else.
<p>
I'm very moved by the Kabuki theatre, and the usage of 
the voice there, and the movement there. And, of course, 
the Butoh dancing comes, is the modern development 
perhaps of the Kabuki. 
<p>
Yeah, Olson, and particularly Duncan and Creeley--their 
syntactical structure was the thing that got, that I really 
liked. And I hear--Roi at a certain point had that too, had 
that. His of course was different. Ishmael [Reed] had it at a 
certain point but I wasn't too interested in it with him. In 
other words, what I'm talking about is the music, the music, 
the language. Like Genet has a language that is fascinating 
because it is so multi-faceted. It's real but it's not unreal, 
and what is unreal to us is real to him, and what is real to us 
is unreal to him. And yet when you really follow what 


Edmund White [Genet's biographer] is talking about, he's like 
making this man come alive by in a way not denuding of his 
magic, but making his magic more accesible to others. It's a 
dense book. It's also history of Cocteau, and of course that 
Sartre, and [Simone] de Beauvoir. And there was an 
Algerian poet who wrote a very small book about Genet, 
about a hundred pages, and that book was fascinating. When 
I asked Allen [Ginsberg] about this Genet book, he said, "Well, 
yes, I looked at it." He said, "Burroughs read it." He said he 
looked in it to see if his name was mentioned. Indeed.  
[Laughs] No, he would not be mentioned. As a matter of fact, 
Genet was asked by this Algerian, what did he think of 
Tennessee Williams? And he said, "I never think of 
Tennessee Williams."
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  There was one place where Baraka wrote 
about your music as having "an emphasis on total 
area...giving it means to evolve, to move as an intelligently 
shaped musical concept" which is an idea seemingly relates to 
Olson's concept of...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Projective Verse? Hmm...
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  A movement towards form via activity--or 
activity via form--whichever way it works, though it's 
probably form through activity...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Form through activity, or, the function 
determines the form, or is it the form that determines the 
function? I think it's the function that determines the form. 
So, yeah, through activity, yes. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  And total area. Olson used the page, and 
there's more to that connection when I think of your 
writing. The way that historical concepts, those "distant 
valleys," and mythology, your present--present moment, 
past moment and future projected. It seems like since you 
know Duncan and Olson that maybe...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Oh, certainly they had an influence on me, sure. 
Also Mike McClure. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  His work with forms, shapes?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Yeah. But, I don't really concern myself too much 
about form. And the reason I don't is because I know it's 
there. I'm always surprised to find out how it's there. One of 
the things about Cormac McCarthy that I found interesting, 
and I had started doing something very similar. Because the 
awareness of the intricacies of what you do become plainer 
the longer you do it. Like Arthur Miller said the other night, 
that he was concerned with form. He said, "All writers are 
concerned with form, daddle daddle dah." I thought to 
myself, that's why you're such a dull ass. 
<p>
But anyhow, what McCarthy does in <i>Blood Meridian</i>, he 
might give you the name of the chapter, but he lists all the 
events that are going to happen. And I realized that, for 
instance in this word thing that I'm working on now:  a 
month ago I started writing certain things down that I was 
going to deal with in this work. And this morning I finished 
another section. What was really interesting to me was that 
I read four other sections of this work and I saw the 
relatedness in terms of this material. That's enough. I said, 
"yeah, well, I guess if I was pressed to, I could get into the 
unifying links with all of this stuff." But that's not fun. But 
it's there. And what I mean by it is, after you do it enough, 
you make a commitment to the magic. Then the magic 
asserts itself in ways that you don't have to worry about, 
because it is incorruptible. That's the whole thing. Integrity 
must stand. If it stands, then you don't have to worry about 
other things. You do your work and then it comes. Because 
that is the truth. That is the beauty. That is the force. 
However, you just made me realize something. I am not 
conscious of form but yet you cannot not be conscious of it. 
Because you look at the page. And the page let's you know 
certain things. So, of course, one of the things that I'm 
thinking about is how the next part of this poem is going to 
be different in terms of its architecture. 
<p>
I mean, what are they doing, talking about form? I mean, 
you look at the rivers and the mountains. The forests that 
they haven't destroyed yet. Look at these rocks. I could 
have showed you a rock in that place across the street.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  I saw it. Gigantic...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Yes. It's extraordinary. Can you imagine all the 
spirits that are coming out of that rock? And we are, after 
all, just animals and we are a part of nature. We are a part 
of, and we are probably the quickest in terms of duration of 
life. We are the transitory poems. The mountains will be 
here, and perhaps we will be part of a mountain. You know 
there are certain West African tribes that believe that life is 
just a part of death, and when the chemical composition 
changes--some of them believe that they may become a 
mountain stream, star, whatever. I think that we definitely 
go back to the earth. Which is interesting. It's called "mother 
earth." The Portugese say, "Portentosa", that's Africa. And 
actually, the oldest bi-ped was found in the Sahara, she was 
a woman species. But then again that's not really strange 
when you understand that salps, fish--it is the women who 
give birth, and without male--and the women, as they 
mature, they become male and that's how the unite. This is 
not acceptable by a Christian--but they don't know 
anything.
<p>
The other thing that works for me--I'm always amazed--I 
was watching some writer, and he said, "Yes, I write five 
hours every day." And I said to myself, "my, that's really 
disciplined." Though I don't think there's any one way of 
going about it. You may not write, but you may read. But 
you are always thinking about the object of what you're 
thinking about. So, I found this morning that I put out all of 
this information in front of me and I said, "what's gonna 
happen?" And it happened. And I'm already now thinking 
about the next part of this piece.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Going back to the influences:  were there 
people you read subsequent to Duncan, Olson, McClure, and 
the others who had an early impact on you?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Oh, yes. Garcia Lorca. Kaufman. I knew--I had the--I 
spent time with Kaufman. One night, boy, I was at this 
building that was on First Avenue and First Street. It was a 
sort of triangular shaped building, and Ginsberg, [Peter] 
Orlovsky, Le Roi Jones and Kaufman and myself were in this 
room. And I just stood there. And there was no question in 
my mind who the force was in that room. 
<p>
He was like a spirit. I met Kaufman through these two 
women that I was very close to at one point, and they had 
known Kaufman before. So finally when I met him, he came 
to the Five Spot one night I was working there, said "You've 
gotta come with me after you finish work." I said, "Look, Bob, 
I started working at quarter after nine, I won't be finished 
until four o'clock, I can't do this." So he said, "Yes you will," 
and he came at four o'clock and he took me over to what is 
now Soho, and he read poems to me until about quarter 
after one the next afternoon. And I remember walking out 
of that loft completely energized--I hate that word--but 
completely transformed. He was also, probably, the most 
extraordinary looking poet of his time, too. I mean that 
helped, of course. He was extraordinary. When he was in his 
last periods, and he didn't speak, I was in Frisco, and I saw 
him. He just came up to me and said [with a beckoning 
motion] like this, and we went and had coffee. And this 
happened twice. We went into coffee shops. And we just sat 
there. But I was very fortunate, I met [Jack] Kerouac in a 
same kind of way. Before <i>On the Road</i>. 
<p>
You see, the trick about all of this shit is, if you're 
fortunate enough to have longevity, then you may get 
certain kudus that you're not really responsible for. Cause I 
don't know, really, who started the Beat movement. I have 
my own feelings about it, cause I heard--I know what 
Kaufman was about. That shit--what he was doing there--the 
nature of the language. And this is all happening when 
Norman Mailer is supposed to be the great American writer. 
I prefered Bill Styron, personally--well, the first Styron 
book <i>Lie Down in Darkness</i>, that one. 
<p>
There's a fantastic poet, a black guy that's dead now, he 
wrote <i>Harlem Gallery</i>, Melvin Tolson. Do you know him? I 
loved Audre Lorde. I thought Audre Lorde was 
extraordinary. The last time I was staying in Berlin, I heard 
that there was this woman's bookstore that Audre--Audre, 
when she was having cancer, she was going to Berlin--I 
heard that she went into this woman's bookstore and that 
she was quite well known. So I go in there, I'm standing 
there ten seconds and this woman walks up to me and says, 
"We don't serve men in this bookstore." And I said, "You 
don't?" Well, I had certain words for that lady and I would 
never be welcome back there again. But the idea of this shit 
is so ridiculous. Well, I won't get into that. I thought <i>Cancer 
Journals</i> was an extraordinarily courageous book. Audre 
Lorde, that stuff that she wrote, man, that's the kind of stuff 
that really--she's another one of my favorites. It just rivets 
you, the truth of it, the pain of it. But the pain is not the 
pain the way people think, it's the glory of the ability to be 
able to penetrate that deeply that make you--I mean it's 
frightening to certain people! [Laughter] 
<p>
One of the greatest things that I'll never forget, in 1962, I 
was working in this club on Bleecker Street, the three of us, 
Jimmy Lyons and Sunny Murray, and myself. We were 
working, and this guy came in--he was gonna--we would play 
one set and he would play one set, and he was playing the 
guitar. I'll never forget, it was on a Saturday night. He 
started playing and people just laughed and they thought it 
was great. And we went up and started playing and people 
knocked over tables, knocked over their drinks getting out 
of the club the minute we started playing. And I said, "Well, 
that's okay." Anyway, it turns out that this guy, within two 
years this guy was Tiny Tim. And they loved it. And 
whatever it was we were doing, it really did not please them 
very much. [Laughs] I love it!
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Who else do you think of as important 
artists?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  William Dixon, Bill Dixon is one musician. I think 
Anthony Braxton is, I think that's really something. I think 
that--oh, I think Calatravas, and you know the guy--the 
Englishman who did the Hong Kong Bank? What's his name? 
When that bank was completed in '76, that was the most 
technically advanced building at that time built. He's got a 
building now either in Japan or Spain which I didn't like too 
much. I think the Butoh dancers, Min is. I'm not happy--I 
mean, Arthur Mitchell got a MacArthur. I don't' know why. 
Bill D. Jones got an Arthur, I can understand that somewhat. 
Betty Carter I think is a great artist.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  There's not a lot of poetry, or your writing, 
that is out in print.
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, you know what Anne [Waldman] said to me, 
she said, "Why aren't you published?" So I didn't answer 
her. The reason I am not published is because the reason I 
don't go record companies and ask them could I record for 
them. Cause I've gone through them, I don't do that 
anymore. If somebody wants to publish you, then they'll 
publish you. It's not what I'm writing for. I'm writing cause 
I love to write. And, of course, when the time is right, I 
suppose--I just hope I have something that'll be of interest 
to someone other than myself, that's all. I just do it because 
I love to do it. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Somewhere you talk about writing, or the 
artist's responsibility is to communicate with themself...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  I don't think that's all but I think that's a 
beginning. And when the artist gets a chance to 
communicate with others then you begin to find out 
something else. You begin to find out what it really means to 
have an audience be in front of you and not to even hear 
them breathe. Then you really know something else about 
what is happening.
<p>
Its already happened. It's passed. That's when it goes 
beyond yourself. That's when you're really serving. You're 
serving those group of people who have--you see, people are 
not there by accident. People who come to certain things 
have prepared themselves to do that. It is worth preparing 
yourself to be prepared to serve something, because art did 
not begin with us. It was here before we got here. We are 
just, perhaps, hopefully adding a little something to it. But 
there are whole groups of people who are not artists but 
who love it. So they become lovers of art. In that sense they 
become art lovers, they become artists. And they know 
when bullshit is happening. So if they come, and you're 
doing your little schtickt--whatever it is--and you don't even 
hear them breathe, then that's when you know you've 
achieved another state beyond. That's what you've been 
preparing yourself for. 
<p>
And it really doesn't matter. Sometimes when they hoot--
that can be played within a wonderful way. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Not to get into anything too complicated, or 
semantic, but how much have you considered poetry as 
form seperate from music? I see the structural similarities...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  It's obvious, but I'm not interested in separations. 
What I mean by that is what I'm discovering and becoming 
aware of every day now is that the similarity, although the 
nature of the material is different, the process of building 
the structure are very similar. This is a recognition of 
something that was gradual. And I rather delight in it now, 
because I know, thus far, how to practice. Practice is very 
important to me, musically. In other words, practice is--
forget that--the preparation, the spiritual--the preparation 
is to enter the realm of the spirits. And it is not practice 
because it is voluntary. It is. Practice has to do with 
discipline.
<p>
Discipline, in this society, to me, has to do with sin. It 
doesn't have anything to do with joy. The expression of life 
is confused as a result of sin. Whatever my mother's intent 
was, she insisted that six days of the week I practice. And I 
had to practice. And I mean practice.  On Sunday she said, 
"You can do what you want." That's when the organization of 
my music began, was when she wasn't looking. Hopefully 
she wasn't listening. Factories have to do with treating 
people like they are machine, objects or machine. The whole 
idea of discipline is in the Army. It's like "Onward Christian 
Soldiers." And we're still doing the same thing.
<p>
This wonderful English writer said something about what 
he learned from--he came from the upper classes in 
England--when he went to Africa to study those so-called 
primitive societies, he said that, "in the West we think of 
freedom as a manifestation of our ability to compete. But it 
never entered into our minds what a certain primitive 
people knew. That the greatest human achievement was 
cooperation." And it's true. I mean, I'm a very competitive 
person. I was a very competitive person, cause that's the 
way I was brought up. But then, gradually, I had to decide 
that I was doing it because I really loved doing it, and it had 
only to do with the fact that it was the one thing in my life 
that I could be assured of, that would gratify my senses. 
And you move to the next stage when you recognize the 
reason the senses were gratified was because certain great 
spirits before you allowed you to see the potential of 
developing your senses to that level where you could obtain 
that sense of gratification. Then the next level is you begin 
to see that that's a responsibility you didn't even know you 
were going to be confronted with. That's when the fun 
begins. Or the tragedy. Because, after all, they also know the 
wealth of what it is you have, and they offer you things to 
make you be more in-tuned with their abilities to sell it. 
[Laughs]
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  What about the idea of de-personalization. 
In your poetry, the writing that I've seen, it's not an "I". 
There's no I. In conjunction with the idea of sound being 
within the whole body so everything comes from within the 
body yet there is a clan. There's an idea of a process of 
developing a group of people you're speaking with or who 
tune in to what you're doing. Your writing is very personal, 
extended outward and becomes this cosmological bridge, 
meeting, a communion through the elements. You talk 
about spirits, but there's more than that...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, there are sources of investigation. And what 
you're trying to do--the fun is to see what you finally learn 
from these, and how you--what is the end product of all this 
investigation, in terms of your own statement. Because, you 
know, the statement becomes more finite as it grows, if it's 
growing. 
<p>
When I do it there are certain procedures that go down. 
For instance, there are the physical exercises which must 
be done, and the wonderful breakfast. Breakfast comes after 
the first stuff--no push-ups, no sit-ups. There are physical things 
that I do. I tried push-ups, it was too much labor involved. I didn't 
like it. Gravity is one thing, but--what I mean is, the wonder 
of all of this--and this is where the people people come in, 
and the different cultures come in. When you attempt to get 
involved with what is magical for them, even if you don't 
agree with it. But just to do it, and then to find out what the 
exposure means to you and to think about it and then to see 
gradually how it affects what it is that you do.
<p>
The writing is the last thing that happens.
<p>
What I'm also learning is, for instance, in listening to these 
august poets read, see, it was fascinating for me to try to 
imagine the dramaturgy that was going through their 
heads as they were reading. Like Anne [Waldman], for 
instance, had this friend of yours, Steven Taylor. He plays 
the violin or something? Well she had two of them, and she 
was singing, or something. I said to myself, "Well, now, well, 
hmm, that's an evening's work." I'm thinking, mmm, the 
two other times I heard Anne read, it was not that. Some 
people I would consider, but with her I had to digest. So all 
of this is wonderfully exciting because it's the unexpected. It 
had an effect. Because even though I was downstairs, I was 
right. A lot of times, when I listen to all of this music that I 
have scattered all around here I don't have the luxury of 
being able to--well, I suppose I could--I don't sit down and 
listen to them. Sometimes. Marvin Gaye is so powerful that 
when I'm doing my exercises, the rhythm that I have my 
exercises in are altered by what he does, so I don't play him 
when I'm exercising. If I want to dance, I'll play him. When I 
listen to Monk I laugh a lot, because that's so extraordinary, 
that's what that is.
<p>
Listening to music, I have to do things. I have things, like I 
love to wash socks, cause I love warm water on my fingers. 
If I really feel pissed about something, then I'll wash clothes. 
So, I learn from what's happening in music by keeping busy 
doing something else. Until, of course, my turn to do the 
music--and then I've discovered what I've learned. But that 
is also related to when I was really attempting to be a social 
person. Which meant I was going to--it hasn't been that long 
ago--going to bars with a lot of different people, and then 
somebody would say something that would make me very 
angry, and a day and a half later, when I'm practicing then 
I'd understand what made me angry about it, and what 
there was to do about it.
<p>
What is happening now is I'm beginning to understand 
what I do, and some of the effect that it has on other people 
that I'm not happy with in retrospect. So I'm doing this kind 
of self-examination. But, you know, in a nice way, a 
comfortable way. I'm also having my own nunnery. I'm 
deliberately not--Aretha Franklin made this wonderful 
record, with extraordinary piano, called <i>Brand New Me</i>. 
That's what I'm working on.
<p>
The whole thing is, the body is always changing. The cells 
in the body are always changing. When I look at a man like 
[Bob] Dole, for instance, he was leaving with his cronies--one 
of those official buildings in Washington--and the Crime Bill, 
supposedly, was just passed. One of the things he said, but 
he was looking away from the cameras, and he was walking 
away, he said, "And we feel safer already." [Laughs] Now that 
kind of cynicism is, that mindset, that kind of human shit is--
I don't want to touch that, I don't even want to see that. I 
find it in a lot of places and I don't think I need that. I've 
been around that enough. And you pick up those little 
devices and you know how to use them. Because the 
situations are just to be played upon, they're not to be 
made anything magical. It's just a game. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Obviously, you're constructing something 
entirely different. You're using words, and improvising for 
a series of ideas and themes much differently than some 
senator. 
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  But, on the other hand, I do read <i>The Economist</i>, 
and I do read The <i>Voice</i>--not much, but I do it because I 
think <i>The Economist</i> is the best, certainly the most 
interesting "English" periodical that I can read now. And The 
<i>Voice</i> is probably the most provocative American paper 
that I can read. I have the feeling that if I could read 
German, <i>Stern</i> and some of those magazines in Germany 
that are like the equivalent of <i>Time</i> magazine, I have the 
feeling that <i>Time</i>--there's no way to compare them. For one 
thing, obviously the photography in those German 
magazines are much superior.
<p>
But you see, the thing is, growing up one of the reasons I 
was disturbed was because I was raised to believe all of 
these truths that turned out to be not even myths. This is 
the land of opportunity. What opportunity? Equality and 
justice? Took me a long time to understand that none of this 
was true. But when I finally got to that point, that's when 
my whole thing--there's a thing about the haunches. 
Haunches can be found in bridges. It can also be found in 
the attitudes of people. Like slow, Sitting Bull's nickname was 
"slow." I that is wonderful. I can't remember how they said it 
in the Sioux--Sioux is actually <i>nassiew</i>. Wonderful word. The 
French the ones who turned it in to Sioux. Anyway, he was 
a very deliberate young man, and when he was thirteen he 
won his first white feather. 
<p>
The thing about whatever happened to the native 
Americans--all of these societies, like this society, we're all 
animals in the sense that when we get ready to destroy, we 
know how to destroy. Like the Xhosa, for instance, the 
divining ladies--the diviners, among the Xhosa were usually 
women, and part of their body would be painted white and 
the other part would be black and then the lips would be 
red--the diviners were to find out who the amataki were. 
The amataki were the witches. Once they were found, what 
would happen is the divining ladies would come and do one 
of two things there. Their job was to eat, destroy the 
witches. They would either put hot stones--they would put 
the person flat on the ground, and tie them, put them in 
stakes. And then they would put these hot stones on their 
bodies. Or, a more delightful form of torture would be to put 
huge ants on their eyelids, in their ears, in their armpits, 
and then have them eaten alive. With the Sioux, it was first 
of all, bravery. Then generosity. And bravery meant, well, 
war. 
<p>
So it comes back to, really, the great poets are the only--
the really great ones are the only ones who have a real 
feeling for the beauty that is possible through invention, 
which is, after all, what we are originally supposed to be 
here for. Because we were invented. 
<p>
There all of this romantic myth about what one goes 
through. But I always ate well, I always knew how to eat. 
Mother was a dietician, father was a head chef, yeah, but 
okay I always knew how to do that. And I always knew the 
foods to eat. And I always had books. I always could get 
them. I always had clothes. I always knew how to go to the 
theatre when I wanted to. I just never had any money. But 
I always did it, I always got it. And when I really got 
depressed I would go to bed, and I would sleep. I'm not 
saying that I wasn't angry, but just when it got to the point 
when I thought I was going to do something really painfully 
destructive, that's when I would go to sleep. 
<p>
What I am dealing with now is the fact that I've really 
realized for the last maybe twelve years I have been very 
destructive in a certain kind of way. Or maybe even longer 
than that. I have to deal with it now because it's beginning 
to, now--if I don't deal with it, then I won't get the work 
done that I want to get done. Because you can't continue to 
do that to your body, even though you have all these 
yeasts, and wheat germ oils, and all these gimmicks. But I 
did have fun, in my own Rapskallion kind of a way.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  I wanted to ask you about the voices in 
<i>Chinampas</i>. With your spoken stuff you make really great 
use of multi-tracking, moreso than the above average poet 
who gets in to a studio. I was wondering how it's done. Do 
you hear all the voices at once, all the sounds? How do you 
go about layering sounds? There's that great quote where 
you talk about being able to have four or five sounds going 
at once. Then you have multitracks...
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  It's very interesting that you ask me that 
question. You know, when I was like ten or eleven years old, 
mother always took me, although she didn't want me to be a 
musician. She nevertheless took me to hear all the bands. So 
that when I would come home, and I'd go into my room, I 
would imitate with my voice. I would make orchestral 
sounds, I would hear all of this in my head. I could make 
certain sounds that would be the trumpet, certain sounds 
would be the saxophone. 
<p>
And what you have to deal with, then, is you have to deal 
with these teachers who try to take that all away from you.
<p>
Anyhow, I don't hear anything, actually. What happens is 
that you don't even think about it, and you work on it. Once 
you've been touched by extraordinary beauty, they tell 
you what you're supposed to do. And of course everyone 
who has been touched comes up with their own 
methodological concept how to translate that into their own 
language.
<p>
Of course, on the other hand, one of the things that I have 
been doing, and this is why patience is so important--cause I 
won't fuck around with any of these recording companies 
who will not allow me to do exactly what I want to do, as 
much as possible. I've really been thinking for maybe a 
couple of years about this vocal ensemble of singing voices. 
What I've been able to do with musicians--I've had them 
chanting certain things--but I've got a really sort of 
mischievous idea about what I want to do. I have two men 
who have very high voices, I'm going to get two women 
with very low voices, and I'm going to have them all doing 
things. I'm going to have them changing parts, and then 
we'll see who the castrati are. But they can really sing, too. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  In a recording like <i>Chinampas</i>, how much is 
improvised?
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  None of it. What was improvised were the 
instruments. What is also improvised is how the voice is 
used. 
<p>
For this Min Tanaka thing there are three areas that I'm 
dealing with. I'm dealing with how to get to the piano, what 
kind of movement is going to be required. How the voice is 
going to be used, and what kind of language is going to be 
used. By that I mean, is it going to be translated African, or 
is it going to be translated native American Indian, is it 
going to be sung, is it going to be chanted, or is it going to be 
narrative? Then there's the music. Specific sound 
organization of music. So, I'm having a wonderful time 
preparing myself to do all of these things. And I know some 
people are going to come--cause they do come--and I would 
love to surprise them. So I'm working on certain things, to 
see if on the night of the performance I can achieve that 
level of trance to be able to forget.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  Somebody wanted me to ask you about a 
collection called <i>The Mysteries</i>, which was supposed to be 
published.
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Oh my god! A long, long, long time ago. It was 
never  published. I never did anything about it. It's over 
there in the closet there. 
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  It's a manuscript of poems, among your 
piles . . .
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  Well, I like to think of those group of words are 
dealing, in a way, they go back maybe fifteen years. Maybe 
twenty years ago. It was kind of beginning of something, 
and had a lot to do with voodoo. Had a lot to do with 
beginning with George Balanchine's conception of 
movement. Had a lot to do with the beginning of the 
emergence of the Kabuki and the Bunraku, and the Azuma 
kabuki. Also, it had to do with the battle that was going down 
with the bebop musicians who felt that their conception of 
swing was being violated, which is funny, cause they 
couldn't dance anyhow. You had to get over that and you 
had to develop a--fuck all of those people. All of them, all of 
them, all of them, who--not the great ones, for the most 
part, their greatness made them impervious anyhow no 
matter what they said. Their work stood. I mean, Miles Davis 
is a nasty motherfucker, but at one time he was an 
incredibly--I mean the lessons he gave were--I can still--I 
was thinking I don't listen to him at all now. Wouldn't even 
think about it, but it's funny:  I listen to Monk. I listened to 
Monk today. I listen to a lot. There's something about Miles I 
don't want to listen to. I don't listen to him, actually, but he 
was so important. He wrote such beautiful...his conceptions were 
so wonderful. They live with me here.
<p>
What I'm really gonna try to find out now, and I was 
thinking about this today, is that I'm going to go back and do 
certain things that I did twenty years ago, to find out. 
Because most of the great artists that mean so much to me 
are dead. But they were very important to me when I was 
twenty years old. And I'm thinking now about 
rediscovering them.
<p>
<b>Funkhouser</b>:  I'm wondering about what electronics and 
the various technologies, what that foretells, what is the 
future of art. More and more we move away from bodies. It 
doesn't seem to be a momentum that can be stopped. The 
arts are being suppressed in a widespread way. So, you're 
going back to the things that turned you on 20, 30 years 
ago, probably not a bad idea to keep those sensibilities alive. 
<p>
<b>Taylor</b>:  I don't like to accept the idea that the piano, or any 
instrument, is a machine. But I can understand that it is 
possible to say that because, unless it's electrified--I mean, 
when I was growing up, we had a piano in the house that 
you could put a roll in, and it would perform by itself for 
chrissakes, what an awful instrument. I don't really care too 
much, to the point of evaluating what mechanical devices 
are used. That is something--whenever that happens, that 
does. I am interested in seeing what happens, but I know 
what I have to do at this point, or, I don't know what I have 
to do. The point is, right now it's all changing. I've listened to 
more music in the past week than I have in years. I think it 
does have something to do with maybe some choices that 
I'm making in my personal life, and I'm having a wonderful 
time. It's rather scary in a way. It's okay. I know, in a way, 
what the alternatives would be, and they're not--I've done 
that already. 
<p>
So, there are different ways to make surprises happen. 
The other thing about the technocracy of it is, of course, 
destroying the ozone layer. It is destroying forests and 
trees. For instance, now the native americans are now 
thinking--a group of them are really quite open to receiving 
this atomic waste on their land--and they're going to get a 
lot of money for it, which I think is really a very curious 
turn of events. And when one of the Chiefs was asked, well, 
suppose certain things happen? And he said, "Well, we 
believe that if that were to happen, technically there would 
be some device that would be invented that would 
ameliorate whatever the danger was." Now that's optimism. 
<p>
I think maybe the best thing that can be said about New 
York, Manhattan, what they used to think of as skyscrapers, 
[laughs] simply that they're man-made mountains. But now 
that's all past because now the Japanese are building a 
super-skyscraper. And these things are, after all, pretty 
relative, because the amount of stone that went into the 
Giza, and how that was constructed, what, five-thousand 
years ago? We're dealing with a culture that had its own 
continuum for we don't even know how many thousands of 
years. This country is--the United States is a very young--
and of course time is different now.
