                        cracks
               facade

               strange
                         getting

              can't smell the team

                    make
                            return
               so strong
                            a light flickers
               off & on
                            returns
               means

                envision the worlds as islands
                  laid out   before us
                     will smell


                

                           breathing
                 the difference
                   (left, right)?
               catching the quill

                Just
                        rejection
                        continuation
             of what
                isn't real
                 what isn't
                     isn't
                which don't
                  mean
             refusal of
                       identity

                 what
                        takes its toll
                    after years
                                        being
                       playing pool
                 forget to smell the hyacinth
             & the rocks still on the floor of the pickup

                        knowing brick before brick

                    flight from
                                              intense respect for it

     the irony of "end the song"

industrial rhythm
imagined behind
pulsation

                song is autobiographical
           what large song is it within
           human song
                             without much I


        reversing a romanticism of nature
          ("butterfly lice on a thistle")

                       Didn't stop to think
                               about to make
                       wake up with those around

            studying original landformation
            where     birds fear humans
            talk with them

            hear voices see flashes

                                             on the wet beach

                                                                           Bay

                    smoother + defined
                      couldn't draw it

        There became a stain on the cover
        as much as on the leg of a pair of pants
        Perhaps a similar source?

                on the freeway - how many minutes Manhattan?
                nervously                    half over & that's not what
                matters neither after living simple
                counting the stops without a shirt worn
                before a world lived before certain smells
                won't take on (disjunction) to "get ready"

                talk about how to shape

                use that scrawl as always

Mashpee

        near          waves of wire on

sloping snowy ground

morning,
piles of sticks out the window
in a weird reversal
of a century, Mrs. Averett
Wampanoag decendant says
not long ago in our cultural history
"I just want my children to learn the English language and learn it
as well as they can"
by rake on property
what were taverns where crossing paths
where you'd pick up a stick
spit on it and throw it in a heap
to appease the spirits in the area?
