<h3>Hypertext and Poetry</h3>
     <i>for nyc poetry talks</i>
<p>
   A force which has marked much twentieth century poetry, in the 
Pound-Eliot-Olson lineage, in ethnopoetry, language poetry, and 
other areas, is that structures, ideas, and flows of language are not 
necessarily linear.  Though Ted Nelson's definition of hypertext, 
referring to a specific type of "non-sequential writing," comes in the

sixties, (Lib 44) one can easily argue that authors of complex writing

overstepped traditional speech and speech-making patterns long 
before then.  Poetry and other adventurous art began the practice of 
hypertext much earlier in the century than is generally 
acknowledged.  In this way, technology is just now catching up to 
what progressive minds have been doing across atomic - atomicized 
decades.  
<p>
   Hypertext and "electronic poetry" (poetry produced by computer, 
digital media, video) are the foci of my work at this moment.  To 
further specify the term, hypertext is "a database with nodes 
(screens) connected with links (mechanical connections) and link 
icons (to designate where the links exist in the text)." (Heim 154)  
Hypertext is a type of textual branching which also allows the reader 
to link text freely with audio and video.  This particular process is 
usually called hypermedia, a multimedia approach to presenting 
information.  Intertextual connections previously enabled only in the 
individual mind, or by performance, are now elemental alongside 
the textual reality of the book.  Now, the verb and noun of language 
posess a different kind of materiality in an electronic poem.  
   A passage from Jed Rasula's book, <i>The American Poetry Wax 
Museum</i>, furthers the dimensions of a conversation on this subject:
<blockquote>
	The complex multimedia environment we inhabit offers a 
	reproachful reminder about the archaic posture implied by the 
	scriptural mode.  Would it make a difference--and would that 
	difference be audible rather than legible--to invoke another 
	model?  Instead of text and commentary, then, consider the 
	format of exhibition and soundtrack.  A display in one medium,

	the visual is attended and articulated by a performance in 
	another medium, audial... (36)
</blockquote>

Rasula's theories are inquisitive and polemical, but a lack of
material 
evidence prevents him from prescribing how a widespread shift to 
other media might benefit poetry.  He introduces the possibility that 
a textual expansion is important for poets to consider.  Contrarily, 
Rasula is skeptical of the technology's ability (specifically
computers 
and television) to distill contemporary writing into a vital force.
He 
warns, "In our media environment (an environment, to be precise, 
inseparable from its media), the frantic mobility of voices amounts to

a vast spectacle of dissociative turbulence." (42)  This echoes
Michael 
Heim, who in <i>The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality</i> writes, "The 
disadvantages of hypertext include disorientation and cognitive 
overload." (154)  
<p>
   It is a perplexing moment between contemporary poetry and its 
relationship to media where, "The printed page is no longer the sole 
medium of writing:  electrical pulsations on a monitor dissolve print 
fixity into print fluidity, which is an oxymoron." (Rasula 45)  While 
print and non-print modes of textual presentation are not mutually 
exclusive, awareness of computer hypertext has begun to 
have an effect on how writing is performed and staged.  For a poetry
publisher on the Internet, and in digital multimedia, the project is, 
how to <i>craft</i> with it.  How to organize and present research,
and 
(inter)active ideas in an organized yet unforced manner.  
<p>
   Among my inclinations of the past decade has been to apply 
different media to poetry, and vice-versa.  In this instance, when 
"editing" hypertexts, or hypermedia texts, one is composing, 
alongside the surface text, a secondary text in another, quasi-
invisible language.  This secondary text is not as smooth to read, is 
not recognizable as poetry.  This transparent (computer) language is 
not, however, without creative premise and result.  There are new 
problems and difficulties, nuances in laying out a poem on the 
screen.  As <a href="http://iberia.vassar.edu/~mijoyce">Michael
Joyce</a> writes, "any electronic text is a present-
tense palimpsest." (9)  What possibilities and difficulties are held
by 
the mechanized, animated palimpsest?  It is, as is poetry, more 
complex than putting letters down on a page.
<p>
   The past few months, my concentration has swayed in the 
direction of finding archival uses for publishing and otherwise 
presenting and preserving poetry in a hypertextual manner in 
virtual pools.  The rest of this talk outlines and gives some 
background to <b>Reading Poetry on the World Wide Web (WWW)</b>, a 
pedagogical project of mine which has been up on the web for a few 
weeks.  Its intention is to draw together and usefully arrange a 
panorama of poetry currently accessible on the WWW -- and 
whatever the web will become -- and, ideally, contribute materials 
to it.

You'll see a quote from Ted Nelson:
<blockquote>
	...there would be new documents, a new literary genre, of 
	branching, non-sequential writings on the computer 
	screen...these branching documents would constitute a great 
	new literature, but they would subsume the old, since all 
	words, all literature would  go online and extend to a new 
	branching generality. (Opening 46-47)  
</blockquote>
While augmentation, rather than subsumption, might be a better 
way to envision hypertext, the spirit and design of Nelson's vision 
are acknowledged as an ingredient of our site.  Below the quotation 
is the temporary infrastructure of the project, there is a list of 
students' names which link to nodes uncovered by their research.  
<p>
   Late last year I began to formulate very specific ideas about how 
hypertext (or hypermedia) could be used to orchestrate poetry in a 
useful, and what I feel is purposeful, manner.  The idea is to
present, 
in hypertext (and, eventually, hypermedia), a script, a creation of 
multiple poetries.  To amalgamate towards (undetermined) 
coherence a complex and fantastic range of "poetry" accumulated 
across centuries and cultures.  A generality made-up of many, many 
particulars.  
<p>
   The seeds of this project go back a few years.  One of the tenets I

learned at Naropa Institute particularly comes to mind:  "All fields
of 
study are understood to represent the creativity of many people 
working in different ages, places, and cultural contexts." (Catalog 6)

My impulse here has roots in a type of idealism.  Macrocosmically, it 
is about an abstracted kind of community-forming which could have 
utility to readers at all levels and areas of interest.  It presents
itself 
as an equilateral literary adventure.  A digital combing and map of 
the corpus - corpse poetic in an era where the public has become 
increasingly dependent on electronic and broadcast media.  
<p>
   In its present form, the project is a student - teacher
collaboration 
in a Reading Poetry course at the University at Albany.  Thus far, we 
have just completed the first stage, the first half, of a semester's 
project:  to have students maintain web pages containing links to 
poetry sources they have found on the net.  It has been at least a 
three part process.  First, students were directed to read the
course's 
printed text, <i>The Handbook of Poetic Forms</i>.  Each student was 
required to carefully research four assigned topics from the book, 
and -- after instruction on how to do-so -- "surf the web," with the 
objective of locating as many poetry resources as possible.  Next, 
students were taught how to build their own web-pages, & how to 
work with html 

<!-- HYPERTEXT... link to http://www.teleport.com/~blay/instruct.html -->
<!-- removed by npsmith on 6/30/97 (no ~blay)                         -->
(HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE) code in order to 
manage these pages.  As a group, we are creating one text which 
unites the writing of many authors.  Since most of the students have 
had little experience with computers and networks, the demands of 
teaching them the mechanical dimensions have been significant.  
<p>
   It is in solving the present, second wave of questions, applying 
further implementation of thought and web-programming to the 
materials we are gathering, that the actual evidence for learning will

become valuable for students and others.  Beyond the initial 
challenges, there are questions such as how to organize and index the 
materials we gather as a unit.  There is no other such project, or 
precedent for this project as yet.  The so-called "mainline" poetry 
centers on the web (such as the <a
href="http://english-www.hss.cmu.edu/poetry">English Server at
Carnegie-Mellon</a>, 
the <b>Electronic Poetry Center</b>, et. al.) are either highly specialized,
or a 
hodge-podge of links.  It is important, in my vision, to present the 
immense amount of materials in a design which enables readers to 
encounter no more than the requisite obstacles -- such as basic 
technical difficulties -- when it comes to locating poetry (open-
writing, what-have-you) using network devices.  Poetry can 
effectively resound and educate people on the net, beyond just being 
present there for someone to stumble across by coincidence.  The 
organization and indexing poetry on the web is crucial if this zone of

our culture is to be valued by readers and writers of poetry.  For 
now, we are preparing at least two-indexes for the reader:  a basic 
author index, and another by theme, form, and/or subject matter (i.e. 
type of poem).
<p>
   Quickly, I wanted to touch on potential problems facing the type of

hypertext proposed; issues we're keeping a keen eye on, in this 
arena:  
<blockquote>
1)  Censorship.  What happens if the content of some of the 
writing is antithetical to the interests and false morality, the
overall 
intentions of those who operate the networks?  
<p>
2)  Access.  The Internet and associated networks must be as widely 
accessible as is practical, or needed.  
<p>
3)  Issues of copyright, and to a lesser degree, payment-for-writing.
</blockquote>
This is somewhat of an issue mostly because academic literature is 
business.  Technical realities and adjustments, compromises and 
coordinations between print publishers and technicians, may 
allow for some aspects of this scheme to play itself out.  Especially
if 
authors, publishers and electronic library/datanodes find ways to 
work cooperatively, as they have to some extent with printed texts.  
<p>
   Reading Poetry on the World Wide Web is, on another register, a 
logical by-product of a movement towards the deterritorialization of 
poetry in America over the past several decades.  An all 
encompassing, ultra-pluralistic poetics has yet to be woven, or even 
approached by most American writers in the past century.  There 
are, to date, neither any general nor any specific terms under which 
we might classify "Our" "national "poetry."  In fact, as Rasula
writes, 
the notion of delineating "Our poets" is deceptively democratic.  He 
speculates that, "such a phrase has never implied a radius bigger 
than an exclusive country club." (292)  One of the purposes of this 
project is to suggest that hyper-media and organizations of thought, 
allow for a fully-inclusive compendium of poetry to begin 
accumulating.
<p>
   There are two points I will reiterate.  First, the ongoingness of 
these ideas for hypertext and poetry.  The premise is of perpetual 
beginnings and understandings of what, say, computers and humans 
can and cannot do.  We're at an early point with it.  There is 
warranted hesitation.  Among the hesitations from those less 
enthusiastic about technology is that the "hardware" is unstable.  
True, and there are obviously other problems.  But digital media in 
one form or another will, for better or worse, be with us for some 
time.  What I've thought to get going is the beginnings of the kind of

poetry core within-the-system to be built over future decades.  
<p>
   Finally, there is an essential collaborative nature required by
such 
intricate and precise creative projects.  When it comes to merging 
poetry with technology, composition as collaboration is an integral 
part of the formula for efficiently producing sophisticated texts.  It
is 
at once an effect, and a necessity, when it comes to devising texts as

hypertext and hypermedia.  Hybrid texts developed by programmers 
and poets to graphically avail literature to the imagination -- and to

make varied reading lists -- are a considerable approach to 
circulating and conducting texts for writers in the open today.  
Promoting multi-perspectival thinking and creativity, the greater 
tenets and purposes of poetry, amongst the culture-at-largening 
cannot be harmful.
