<b>THE COURSE:</b><br>
<br>
Dr. Frankenstein's Monster threatens all of humanity; Bill
Gates's Internet promises a new
sense of human community.  New technologies, socially neutral in
and of themselves, often
get instilled with utopian hopes and dystopian fears current in a
culture.  Through a study of
science fiction as cultural artifact readers can uncover some of
these desires and phobias. 
With this conception of science fiction texts as informative
cultural remnants in mind, this
course will examine sci-fi material from the past two centuries
paying particular attention to
the way new technologies are represented.<br>
<br>
In addition, we will also grapple with several other ideas
prominent in the literature of science
fiction.  These will include but not be limited to:  the
formation of "human" identity through
contact with alien life, cyborgs and the problems for "human"
identity in the face of artificial
life, the writing of fantastic literature itself as a utopian or
liberating act, "postmodern"
existence, and "postmodern" writing.  You will be asked to choose
one general theme from
our class discussions and address it at length in a final term
paper.<br>
<br>

<b>YOUR GRADE:</b><br>
<br>
<b>Quizzes:</b>  Quizzes in this class are designed simply to
insure that you have done the
assigned reading.  They will happen sporadically throughout the
course (often on days when
attendance is low) and will be <i>very</i> easy.  If you have
done the reading you will ace
the quiz.  <b>There are no make-up quizzes</b>; dead dogs, broken
cars, food poisoning,
notes from Dr. Mom and the like will get you no consideration. 
If you miss a quiz (or if you
come in after a quiz is over) it counts as a zero.<br>
<br>
<b>Group Presentation:</b>  Everyone will be assigned to a group
with approximately four
other students; each group will present on one of the required
texts on the last day we are
scheduled to discuss it.  Presentations will last 20 to 30
minutes and can take a variety of
forms.  Everyone in the group may somehow participate in the
single presentation of a single
interpretation of the reading.  The group could present what it
feels is the most compelling
theme of the text with each member adding to the general
argument.  Alternatively, each
member of the group may present on a different aspect of the text
(e.g.:  present biographical
research on the author, present historical research on some of
the social issues current when
the text was being written, articulate different themes in the
text, present interpretations other
scholars have offered about the text, make a comparison between a
theme in the text and the
same theme at work in other sci-fi material, write a postscript
to the story or an alternative
ending, etc.)  For some presentations I will direct your group to
address a specific issue or to
include a particular idea in your presentation, but generally I
do not want to interfere too
much in the organization of the presentations.  I will however
speak with your group several
days before your presentation in order to make sure everyone is
on the same wave-length. 
"Go Boldly!" as the captain of the Enterprise should say, with
these presentations.  Feel free
to bring in videos, slides, art, other texts, etc.  I will reward
creativity and thoughtful
engagement with the text and will penalize redundancy,
obviousness and lack of
commitment.<br>
<br>
The goal of these presentations is to enhance our understanding
of the texts.  Consequently,
there will be a question period after each presentation during
which I will call on other class
members to ask the group questions about their text (so everyone
should be prepared to ask at
least one good question about each text).  On the day of your
presentation you will hand in
one to two pages describing what you presented and how it
contributed to our understanding
of the text.<br>
<br>
<b>Paper Abstract:</b>  An abstract of your final paper is due on
14 April.  This should be
two to three pages discussing your final paper.  I will be
looking for a clear articulation of
your paper's thesis and a brief elaboration of its argument.  I
will then write a short evaluation
of your project telling you what I think you should focus on,
what needs more development,
and (if necessary) what ideas should be abandoned in favor of a
fresh start.<br>
<br>
<b>Final Paper:</b>  Due on 5 May, your final paper will be eight
to twelve pages long and
double-spaced.  You have two options for your final paper:<br>
<ul>
     <li> <i>The critical option</i>:  Use a theme we have
          discussed during the semester to talk about some
          science fiction text not assigned for the class.  You
          may choose a book, short story, series of short
          stories, comic book, film, TV series, or any other
          sci-fi material.  Discuss your chosen text in terms of
          one of the central ideas of the course:  utopian
          technological promise, dystopian technological
          paranoia, formation of identity through contact with
          alien life, formation of identity through contact with
          artificial life, writing itself as a
           utopian or liberating act, or any other general theme
          that evolves from class discussion.  You may wish to
          <i>briefly</i> describe how this theme works in
           some of the course reading.
     <li>  <i>The creative option</i>:  Write your own science
          fiction or cyberpunk story somehow incorporating one of
          themes discussed during the semester.  In addition to
          the eight to twelve page story, you will also write at
          least two pages of critical prose explaining how your
          story works with the particular theme from the course. 
          You will, in a sense, be your own literary critic.
</ul>
<br>
<b>Class Participation:</b>  You are expected to participate
thoughtfully in class discussion
and in small group discussion.  In order to get full credit for
class participation you should
make at least four well-articulated contributions to class
discussions during the semester.  In
addition, you are allowed only three absences; more than three
will result in the lowering of
your class participation grade.  If you are going to be more than
ten minutes late to a class
please do not bother to show up at all.<br>
<br>
<b>Class Listserv:</b>  As a supplement to our class discussions
I have set up a listserv with
which we can continue our conversations outside of class.  For
those too shy to participate
regularly in class this is an opportunity to speak at your own
pace.  The discussions on the
listserv are meant to be informal and fun; do not worry about
grammar or accuracy; think of
the listserv as a casual caf‚ where you can follow up on issues
raised in class, ask questions
about the readings, make connections to other sci-fi material,
argue for or against particular
ways of reading a text, test out hypotheses, and just plain talk.

You will be required to make
at least five thoughtful contributions to the listserv discussion
over the course of the semester
(I am the arbiter of "thoughtful.")  After your first five, any
additional contributions you make
will gain you <b>extra credit</b> points (seven points maximum). 
I will also use the listserv
to post important class messages so get in the habit of checking
your email every day.<br>
