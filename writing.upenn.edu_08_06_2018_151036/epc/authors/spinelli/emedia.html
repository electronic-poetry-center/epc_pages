<b>What?</b><br>
<br>
This course is about writing.  No matter what your intended major, no matter what
kind of job you're shooting for after college, the skills of writing and communicating
in a clear and lively way are simply necessary for success.  The average mechanical
engineer for example spends 60 - 70% of her time not at the drafting board or CAD
system, but writing specifications and proposals.  All of us, from you and I to Fredric
Jameson and Stephen King, can improve our writing.<br>
<br>
<b>About what?</b><br>
<br>
We will read and talk about the media's use of language in our culture.  How is
language used to set limits on discussion and acceptable parameters for debate?  What
is the connection between language and thinking?  How do advertisers use language to
get us to buy?  How do politicians use language to keep us happy (or quiet)?  (Don't
worry if all this sounds ominous-- more than you can handle -- this course is really
just about looking at how the same story gets told in different voices.)<br>
<br>
<b>How?</b><br>
<br>
Our in-class writing and take-home essays will grow out of our discussions and group
work on a novel, a book of criticism, the writing on the internet, and a packet of
essays and reading selections about media and the news.  These exercises are designed
to refine a(n)<br>
<ul>
     <li>clear sense of intent and purpose in writing
     <li>organization of ideas within an essay
     <li>understanding of a specific audience and different strategies of address
     <li>methods of peer response and careful editing
     <li>critical thinking and its applications in writing and talking about the
          language of the media
</ul>

<p>
<b>Writing and reading electronically:</b><br>
<br>
Aside from being able to think and write critically about the language of the media, I
also want you to begin to experiment with composing in some new media as well. 
The new media bring with them their own particular methods, and their own particular
ways of constructing the world.  Some of the course reading exists only electronically
as online hypertexts; these will serve as models for some of our own writing
assignments.  I want us to begin writing with these new languages and gain some
understanding of their particular uses, limitations, and biases.<br>
<br>
We will explore writing in this new space every week with responses to reading
assignments posted electronically to our class listserv and by using internet archives
and user groups to do research.  We will also use this new technology in a
collaborative writing project later in the semester.<br>
<br>
<b>What about those nasty little points?</b>
<br><br>
Try to imagine a situation in your future where an ability to communicate and express
yourself as clearly as possible in English would not be an advantage.  It is a difficult
proposition unless you envisage a very exotic life.  Whether writing a history paper in
your sophomore year, or negotiating contracts in a board room fifteen years from
now, a strong command of English will be invaluable.  The aim of this course is not
just to improve your writing, but to help you develop a necessary life skill, a skill
more valuable than any little number or letter found on an essay or piece of university
stationary.  Think "writing" not "grades" and you will leave this course with
something infinitely more valuable than a letter.<br>
<br>
Every essay I return to you will contain extensive comments about its strengths and
weaknesses.  I will comment on (in no particular order of importance):  the content
and critical thinking, the amount of genuine revision and real changes made between
the drafts, the organization, the awareness of an audience, sentence structure and word
choice, and the mechanics of writing (grammar, punctuation, etc.).  Although
<b>THERE WILL BE NO LETTER GRADE ON YOUR ESSAYS</b> I will
comment if I find the work unsatisfactory or of excellent caliber.<br>
<br>
Once before the resign deadline, and once in the last third of the semester, we will
meet individually to discuss your work and your progress (and, if you insist, your
grade).  I will, of course, inform you if there is any danger of you failing.<br>
<br>
The final grade, only because one must be assessed, will be calculated as
follows:<pre>
     %40  three 4-5 page essays
     %30  one 6-10 page research paper
     %20  in-class writings (collected in your journal) and responses to readings
          (collected in your journal and sent to the class listserv)
     %10  intelligent class participation and attendance</pre><br>

<b>The "B-" contract: </b><br>
<br>
To encourage you to focus completely on improving your writing, and to end any
fixation on grades, anyone who complies with all of the following will automatically
get at least a "B-" as a final grade:<br>
<ul>
     <li>turn in all papers on the day they are due
     <li>do all the revisions asked of you
     <li>send all reading responses to the class listserv by the midnight before the
          responses are to be discussed and bring a hard copy to class
     <li>miss no more than two days of class
     <li> show up on time for your conferences 
     <li>turn in a journal with no missing entries at the end of the semester (all in-
          class writings, all reading responses, three drafts of every essay)
     <li>make at least one thoughtful contribution to class discussion per week
          either in class or on the class listserv<br>
</ul>
<b>Disclaimers:</b><br>
<br>
<b>I DO NOT READ LATE PAPERS</b>.  If you think you will have a
problem meeting a deadline you must discuss it with me the class meeting
<b>before</b> the paper is due.  I will usually grant you an extension if you clear
it with me ahead of time; but I have no patience for excuses like "My printer broke",
"The computer lab was full", "I didn't know it was due today", "My roommate stole
the final draft" etc. on the day the paper is due.  Although I will not read late papers
all drafts of all papers must be included in your journal for me to examine at the end
of the semester.<br>
<br>
If you're going to be more than ten minutes late to class please don't bother to show
up.<br>
