For the first time in history, the media are making possible
mass participation in a social and socialized productive
process, the practical means of which are in the hands of the
masses themselves.  Such a use of them would bring the
communications media, which up to now have not deserved the
name, into their own.  In its present form, equipment like
television or film does not serve communication but prevents
it.  It allows no reciprocal action between transmitter and
receiver; technically speaking it reduces feedback to the
lowest point compatible with the system.<sup><a name="ref1"

These words were not written in celebration of the Internet, as one
might expect, but were were written about radio decades ago by German
broadcaster and poet, Hans Magnus Enzensberger.<sup><a name="ref2"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot2">2</a></sup>  Enzensberger critiques mono-directional media
and argues for a democratizing and empowering media rife with promise
for the masses in a language that has recently found new currency with
the net's rise in popularity.

The ease with which Enzensberger's radio essay could be mistaken for a
contemporary tract about the Internet attests to the similarities between
the utopian rhetoric once used to promote radio and the rhetoric now
being used to promote the Internet. This essay is a study of the promises
made for two emergent media: radio and the Internet.  Three common
aspects arise in a close examination of the independent popularization
of radio and the Internet: (1) the emergent medium is instilled with
hopes of initiating utopian democracy, providing for universal and equal
education, and bringing a sense of belonging to a community; (2) cultural
investment in these hopes is encouraged by people in power and exploited
for commercial gain; and (3) the rhetoric of these promises obfuscates
any real understanding of the material place of the emergent medium in
society (such as who has knowledge of its use, how is it used, how is it
produced, how is it consumed, how it addresses both basic and inessential
needs) and ultimately defuses any potential for social change the emergent
medium might have had.  After an analysis of the emergent media of radio
and the Internet, and their utopian rhetoric, I want to suggest a less
naive, more responsible rendition of the net and a way of describing
the net that conceives of citizens as genuine producers, not consumers.

That it operate in the "public interest, convenience or necessity"
was the mandate handed down to radio in the Communications Act of 1934.
But from its infancy as a laboratory experiment, through its advent on the
market, radio was conceived by its creators not as a public service but
as a consumer product.  David Sarnoff, the future president of National
Broadcasting Company, is often given credit for being the visionary
employee of the Marconi Company who first imagined popular radio.
In 1916, in a letter to the company's general manager, he described
the "Radio Music Box" which would "make radio a 'household utility'
in the same sense as the piano or phonograph."<sup><a name="ref3"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot3">3</a></sup>  This letter, notably empty of ideas of public
service, concludes with a generally overlooked table of projected radio
sales which figures that $75 million can be made selling radio sets
in the first three years they are put on the market.<sup><a name="ref4"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot4">4</a></sup>  This document of the seminal moment in American
radio shows only a profit motive driving the production of radio.

Originally the companies that manufactured radio sets were the same
companies that produced broadcast programs.  As the federal government
fumbled to insure standards and regulate the industry, programming
was used to motivate people to consume radio sets.<sup><a name="ref5"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot5">5</a></sup>  By the end of the 1920s, with network
broadcasts beginning to cover the most populated areas of the U.S., radio
began to enter the minds of social thinkers.  Writers, politicians and
educators began to characterize radio as the fertile ground where the
seeds of a better life would take root and mature.

"[A]nything man can imagine,"<sup><a name="ref6"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot6">6</a></sup> was how Martin Codel, a newspaper editor
and later a radio theorist, described the promise of radio in
1930, nearly a decade after the first radio ad quoted Nathaniel
Hawthorne to sell suburban homes to Manhattanites.<sup><a name="ref7"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot7">7</a></sup>  Codel exemplifies the utopian strain in writing
about radio, rhetoric that would be detached from any political agenda
and unconscious of profit motive.  Radio was nothing short of magical.

[T]hat anything man can imagine he can do in the
ethereal realm of radio will probably be an actual
accomplishment some day.  Perhaps radio, or something
akin to radio, will one day give us mortals telepathic
or occult senses!<sup><a name="ref8"

Codel finds in the emergent medium a most interesting space: reality and
fantastic projection overlap and become indistinguishable.  This overlap,
happening in the virtual space of radio, shifts the consideration of life
possibilities from an everyday physical space to an ethereal, magical
one.  For Codel, before radio life possibilities were confined to what
could be done in the material world; after radio there are no limits.
The possibilities of the emergent radio are but virtual possibilities;
they take place not in a material space, not in the space of a physical
being in the physical world, but in the virtual and surrogate world
provided by the emergent medium.  Radio has created a new space that
has not been fully understood.  Its conditions and limits are as yet so
vague that radio can give rise to any utopian plan or individual desire.
The shift in focus onto the surrogate space of the emergent media, the
place where real desires seem to find virtual or "occult" answers, will
ultimately allow virtual or simulated equality to stand in for actual
equality while the switch goes unnoticed.

The feeling of fulfillment offered in the surrogate space of radio
was a key element in the rhetoric of democracy and equality which evolved
around the promotion of the emergent medium.  The Codel-style euphoria
that characterized earlier thinking on radio began to crystalize and
soon led to the suggestion that buying a radio was like buying a seat in
political chambers in that it promised a greater feeling of participation
in a national democracy as well as a sense of access to that democracy
not dependent on class status.  Rudolf Arnheim, a German psychologist of
media and communications effects, wrote in 1936 that the democratizing
power of radio was so complete that it made class distinctions irrelevant,
and the very concept of class an anachronism:

Wireless eliminates not only the boundaries between
countries but also between provinces and classes of
society.  It insists on the unity of national culture
and makes for centralization, collectivism and
standardization.  Naturally its influence can only be
extended to those who have a set, but from the very
first there has nowhere been any attempt to reserve
wireless reception as a privilege of certain classes,
as it might have happened had the invention been at the
disposal of feudal states.<sup><a name="ref9"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot9">9</a></sup></pre><!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

While egalitarian and inclusive in proclamation, Arnheim's conception
of a public does not include all the people in a society.  As Arnheim
describes radio as a requirement for contemporary civilized life,
membership in his public begins to be defined in terms of consumption:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->

<Pre> Rather it is the case that wireless,
like every other
necessity of life from butter to a car and a country house, is
accessible to anyone who can pay for it, and since the price of a
wireless set and a license can be kept low, wireless, like the
newspaper and the film, has immediately become the possession of
everyone.<sup><a name="ref10"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot10">10</a></sup></pre><!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The class limitations of his "everyone" are obvious; "everyone" means car
owners and those that own a second (country) home, not urban laborers or
people who walk or use public transportation.  (But even if we accept
Arnheim's premise that everyone may claim a radio as a birthright, the
previous element of his argument is similarly untenable: that equality
of access to the emergent medium makes for social equality.  In saying
all people are now <i>a priori</i> equal by virtue of access, Arnheim
renders inappropriate any attempt to describe the economic realities that
separate different classes.  Here the rhetoric of the emergent medium
covers up class distinctions while not erasing them.)  For Arnheim, the
"universal commodity"<sup><a name="ref11" href="radio-lessons.html#foot11">11</a></sup> of
radio confers citizenship; it is a "necessity" for citizens in a national
culture.  In order to be counted, one must tune in.  This will soon evolve
into: in order to participate in democracy, one must be a consumer.

In returning to David Sarnoff we again find an elaboration
of this ethic of consumption.  In testimony before the Federal
Communications Commission, Sarnoff describes consumption not only as
a sign of membership in a national culture, but as a quasi-patriotic
act that feeds other American (free market) ideals.  Before the FCC,
as president of the largest producer of receiving sets in the world
(RCA),<sup><a name="ref12" href="radio-lessons.html#foot12">12</a></sup> and chairman
of the board for the first and largest radio network (NBC),<sup><a
name="ref13" href="radio-lessons.html#foot13">13</a></sup> Sarnoff skirts implications of
monopoly while defending competition as an abstract principle.<sup><a
name="ref14" href="radio-lessons.html#foot14">14</a></sup> Sarnoff cloaked himself in the
rhetoric of the social benefits of listenership in order to defend against
federal anti-trust action.  Because the emergent medium of radio could
be conceived as a great leveler, it had a social value beyond price:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<Pre>
[T]he importance of broadcasting cannot be measured in
dollars and cents.  It must be appraised by the effect
it has upon the daily lives of the people of America --
not only the masses who constitute a listening audience
numbered in the tens of millions, but the sick, the
isolated, and the under-privileged, to whom radio is a
boon beyond price.  The richest man cannot buy for
himself what the poorest man gets free by radio.<sup><a name="ref15"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot15">15</a></sup></pre><!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The maintenance of the quality of radio as a social tool was more
important than trust-busting.  And because it is a tool that legitimates
capitalist competition while feeding American myths of equality and
equal opportunity in spite of class, Sarnoff could be given free reign
to develop it in its current form.  The emergent medium is described
as existing beyond pecuniary value because it benefits all sectors
of society; therefore it should transcend any critique of monopoly
capitalism.

What belies the true nature of this proclaimed public space is
that its ownership and management were to remain decidedly in private
hands.  Apparently unaware of the implicit contradiction, a 1939 NBC
informational pamphlet exclaims: "Fortunately for the United States,
the democratic answer to the programming problem was found in private
enterprise."<sup><a name="ref16" href="radio-lessons.html#foot16">16</a></sup>  As is to
be expected, neither Sarnoff nor NBC nor RCA articulates the limits of a
democracy based on the idea of citizen-as-consumer fostered by private
enterprise capitalism.<sup><a name="ref17" href="radio-lessons.html#foot17">17</a></sup>
How could they when their fortunes depend on nurturing a nation of
consistent consumers?

The rhetoric of radio's power to democratize brought with it a
renewed interest in the idea of community.  Arnheim found in radio a
sense of community defined in terms of use and interest, rather than
proximity or economic relation.  He explains how a national unity and
identity are produced out of a collapse of geographic space:

[t]he relation of man to man, of the individual to the
community, of communities to one another was originally
strictly determined by the diffusion of human beings on
the surface of the earth.  Spatial propinquity of
people -- so we used to think -- makes for a close bond
between them, facilitates common experience, exchange
of thought and mutual help.  Distance on the other hand
makes for isolation and quiet, independence of thought
and action . . . individuality and the possibility of
sinking into one's own ego. . . .<sup><a name="ref19"

What would come about with the end of "distance" might today might
be described as the totalitarian effects of a medium or its potential
for control.<sup><a name="ref20" href="radio-lessons.html#foot20">20</a></sup>  Radio can
collapse a regional sensibility, displace independence and individuality,
unify the national community, and make possible a general standardization.
The emergent medium of radio, he says, both homogenizes and colonizes:

Radio, for Arnheim at least, is a collector of individuals into some

The utopian rhetoric of early radio often described this colonization
as "education."  Collected in a celebratory volume on the first decade of
radio published in 1930, Joy Elmer Morgan, then the editor of <cite>The
Journal of the National Education Association</cite>, sees the emergent
medium of radio as an educational tool ripe with potential.  Earnestly, he
declares radio a revolutionary tool on par with the invention of moveable
type.  As with moveable type, radio's revolutionary nature lies in its
ability to generate a unified cultural identity.  For Morgan, education
comes to mean a complete integration into this cultural identity:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->

<Pre>
It will give to all that common background of information,
ideals, and attitudes which binds us together into a vast
community of thinking people.  It is giving the school a
new tool to use in its daily work.  No one can estimate
the stimulus which will come into unfolding life as
radio brings it into instant contact with the great
thoughts and deeds of our time.<sup><a name="ref22"

Morgan also finds in radio a useful kind of isolation or bracketing
off individual experience which insures a fidelity to the common cultural
identity.  In removing the unpredictable variable of interactivity found
in the public school classroom, radio codifies experiences and allows for
controlled learning in isolation.  Radio makes possible distance-learning
from home by turning the home into a sacrosanct schoolroom:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->

<Pre>
[Radio] has helped to keep people in their homes and in
that way to preserve the integrity of home life.  No
other agency can take the place of the home as a force
for excellence and happiness.  In it are the issues of
life.  In a very real sense it is the soil into which
the roots of human life reach for spiritual nourishment
and security.  Whatever radio can do to strengthen the
family circle is clear gain; whatever it can do through
widespread instruction, looking toward better home
practices in such matters as housing, nutrition, family
finance, home relationships, home avocations,
contributes to a better life.<sup><a name="ref23"

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Radio is the proposed antidote for the very social fragmentation
it encourages.  It is a provider of stability that works toward an
America of happy homes while it limits broader human interaction.
Socializing or organizing outside of the highly structured and morally
regulated familial unit (communication that might lead to uncontrollable
political union for example) is thus prevented.  As Morgan continues,
radio becomes more than just a force that keeps a family together.
It provides a virtual example of an appropriate life: "Increasing numbers
of people will catch a vision of what intelligent living really means."
The emergent medium civilizes and humanizes as it educates:

Through experience, through study, through habits of
industry and reflection, and through long years of
right thinking and right doing, there comes into
individual life a unity and a quiet sense of power and
happiness which are the highest of human achievements.
We believe radio has a contribution to make here both
in the school and in the home. It widens the family
circle and the school circle to include the ablest
teachers, the most earnest preachers, and the noblest
statesman.<sup><a name="ref24"

Here consumption rhetorically becomes a productive act.  Because it is
tied to values of self-discipline and industry, radio has the power
to turn buying and passive listening into things more than refining
and educational.  Consumption itself imparts "habits of industry" and
provides a feeling of diligence.

A survey of today's radio landscape fails to reveal the flowering
of what was then seen as nascent democracy, community, and educational
potential.  For a case study I look to Buffalo, New York, where (with
the exception of three small independent holdouts) all commercial radio
stations are now owned by four large media companies.  The result is
a dominance of talk radio and classic hits programming as these same
companies fight over the same "average consumer."<sup><a name="ref25"

The recent decades of FCC deregulation allowed for format changes by
freeing stations from having to employ news personnel and reducing or
eliminating community service broadcasting requirements.  But, because
regulations preventing large-scale corporate ownership remained intact,
the real homogenization of radio content did not occur until 1992 when FCC
deregulation made it possible for a single company to own up to 49 percent
of some radio markets.<sup><a name="ref26" href="radio-lessons.html#foot26">26</a></sup>
Consolidated ownership, when coupled with the programming deregulations
of past years, has lead to a massive increase in the broadcast of canned
programming (pre-recorded programs produced outside of the local region
and distributed via satellite or postal carrier) in Buffalo.

Hearing the listening choices diminish, and noticing in particular
the lack of local bands now receiving air time, the Buffalo Common
Council launched an investigation of local broadcasting in 1994.
Their public study describes "a virtual blackout of local music"<sup><a
name="ref27" href="radio-lessons.html#foot27">27</a></sup>: only one song in roughly 900
played on commercial radio came from a local band without a national
record contract.  The Council invited the management of local stations
to a public forum to address concerns about the lack of local context
and content in broadcasts and the reduced variety in program offerings.
Instead of appearing at the forum, the management of WKSE-FM (consistently
one of the top rated music stations in Buffalo) sent a letter to the
Council stating that they had "no legal or moral obligation to play music
by local musicians" and that there were no FCC guidelines indicating
that they should even consider the issues raised by the Council:

demand exists for more music by local artists.  It is
our opinion that our ratings would be damaged and our
profitability impaired if we were to increase our
commitment to local musicians. . . .  Meanwhile, we
would encourage the local musicians coalition to strive
to continually improve the quality of their work.  Only
then can they hope to gain a contract with a recording
company who can promote them into a position to be
played on our airwaves.<sup><a name="ref28"

This letter emphasizes clearly and repeatedly that the profit motive
exclusively, not any conception of community, is guiding the development
of this radio station.  The capitalism of deregulated commercial
broadcasting does not even have room for the ideas "local" or "community."
In order for a band to be described as a local success it must have a
national contract.  Regional interest is simply not a category.  It should
further be noted that stations' playlists do not even represent a kind of
populist democracy in terms of most simple popular opinion determining
what gets played.  Marketing analysts are employed not to determine
general popularity but only to define what is the most sellable or
what will be the most appealing to an audience of consumers.<sup><a
name="ref29" href="radio-lessons.html#foot29">29</a></sup>  Here again membership in
a public would be defined as an ability to purchase.  The management
of WKSE-FM has even failed to understand how, by only making available
limited musical choices calculated to appeal to a targeted audience, they
might help determine the musical taste and interest of local consumers.
The station plays what is popular to increase listenership and advertizing
revenue, but they have not recognized that what they play influences
what gets bought and what is popular.  Simply put: people will not buy
music they have never heard before.

Local music is not the only avenue presented for the expression of
community.  Talk radio has received much popular press for facilitating
democracy.  But this democracy is wholly inflected by a profit motive
as well.  Arbitron ratings for the Buffalo market (Autumn, 1995) show
that a single and delineable demographic constitutes the audience for
all the top talk shows.  The fight to attract this demographic between
every daytime talk show has eliminated content difference and reduced
what might have been an exchange of ideas to a repetition of the single
ideology of the target demographic.  In Buffalo the hosts of all the
daytime shows on all the top rated talk stations are exclusively right
of center, libertarian, and populists (Rush Limbaugh, G. Gordon Liddy,
or locally-based equivalents).  For an active demonstration of the
counter-democratic operation of these programs we need only examine the
way the callers are handled: All calls are carefully screened to prevent
airing anything that might shock listeners into turning off their radios.
Guests and callers with views opposed to those of the host/audience
are invited to speak only in so far as the host may confirm carefully
predicted listener fears about an issue or to provide an opportunity for
the host to engage in <i>ad hominem</i> or to assert his verbal prowess.
Should a caller slip past the screener and seriously threaten the
host/audience he or she is quickly and easily disconnected and the host is
given ample time to recontextualize the caller in an unthreatening manner
or to dismiss the caller as simply abhorrent.  Talk radio "Democracy,"
like "The Latest News," or "The Greatest Hits of the '70s," is simply a
programming format aimed at a specific demographic to insure faithful
listening and (indirectly) steady consumption by the target audience.
As with the radio of the 1930s, today's talk radio offers only a promise
of democracy.

The utopian rhetoric that surrounded the emergent medium of radio
functioned largely to obscure a profit motive; and, in a celebration
of consumption-as-citizenship, the needs for real democracy, fulfilling
community, and equality in education were not realized even in a virtual
sense in the surrogate space of radio.  The same hopes have become staples
of Internet theory.  As with radio, the utopian promotion of the net
under the rubrics of democracy, community, and educational opportunity,
will serve only to obscure economic and representational disparity and
thwart any democratizing potential the net might have.

As it is typically characterized by Internet promoters, access to
the net is another great social leveler which does away with government
and gives equal weight to everyone's voice.  When Gingrich asserts,
"Everybody's an insider as long as you're willing to access [the
information on the net],"<sup><a name="ref31" href="radio-lessons.html#foot31">31</a></sup>
"access" becomes not simply a supplement to democracy, but the only way
democracy can now work.  In strikingly similar terms to the discussion of
early radio, the emergent medium of the Internet can end the oligarchy
and provide us with genuine democracy.  For Gingrich, the Internet is
not just a corrective to democracy, it is democracy.

In January 1995, Gingrich testified in front of the House Ways and
Means Committee about the democratic imperative of access to information
through the Internet.  He said:

Gingrich neglects to acknowledge a basic economic reality in his
assertion that a tax-credit-for-access would equal opportunity: He does
not mention or is not aware that the vast majority of poor people would
not save enough through an annual tax credit to buy even the most basic
software package.

The scope of net promotion is not confined to guaranteeing
democracy. An evangelical zeal has evolved within Internet rhetoric.
Being online offers a kind of salvation which must be heralded to
everyone.  In this way Gingrich's Internet functions as Morgan's radio
did:

Maybe private companies ought to do it.  But somehow
there has to be a missionary spirit in America that
says to the poorest child in America, "Internet's for
you.  The information age is for you."  There's an
alternative to prostitution, drug abuse and death, and
we are committed to reaching every child in this
country.  And not in two generations or three
generations; we're committed this year, we're committed

The recourse again to private ownership/management is more than a rehash
of the now standard "smaller government" rhetoric.  Its implications
are capitalist colonization and perpetuation of a market.  If private
companies supply people with simply another way to consume wrapped in
the promise of equal opportunity, money would soon find its way back to
those owners in the form of training classes, always "affordable" user
fees, and the sale of ancillary computer products and services each with
additional attendant promises.  Money that could be returned or given
to the disenfranchised to improve their real lives (to buy clothes  or
food, to build new schools, or to rent busses to transport angry voters
to Washington to lobby Congress or protest) is channeled back into the
accounts of private companies.  The virtual possibilities of "anything
man can imagine" cover up real, material disparities with the promise
of the benefits of access.

The official vision for the Internet from the White House, <cite>The
National Information Infrastructure: Agenda For Action</cite>, is also
utopian.  On the first page we encounter language that could have been
lifted directly from Morgan's tract on radio and education: "The best
schools, teachers and courses would be available to all students, without
regard to geography, distance, resources, or disability. . . ."<sup><a
name="ref34" href="radio-lessons.html#foot34">34</a></sup>  This education is still based
in some school somewhere, and maintains the rather traditional concept
of education with students, teachers, and courses.  Described in this
way its disruptive force is not revealed.  What this description lacks
however is an acknowledgement of the real economic and political problems
that can come with this idea of collapsed geography and local context.
Carried to fruition, a centralized model of distance learning would
electronically shift larger and larger blocks of the student population
to what are currently considered the "best" schools.  Increasing virtual
enrollment at these (almost exclusively suburban) schools would cause
a shift in public educational dollars from poorer schools less prepared
to deal with the "information age" to schools already in possession of
liberal technology budgets.  Even better programs would then be created at
the these large affluent schools.  As poorer urban schools have funding
decreased and are forced to close due to declining enrollment, poorer
students who are currently excluded from the information age by the
economic realities of their own lives and educational facilities would
then be even further removed from the physical sites of education
and would ultimately have less access to educational materials.
These students will be left behind in the race to virtualize education.

The <cite>Agenda</cite> continues, "vast resources of art,
literature, and science are now available everywhere."<sup><a name="ref35"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot35">35</a></sup>  Beyond the overstatement (fewer than four
hundred books are currently available online for the cost of access
alone), this assertion reveals the <cite>Agenda</cite>'s monolithic
spirit.  What the <cite>Agenda</cite> does not observe is that a fixation
on a global community of art and literature will cause the destitution
of locally relevant art and literature in the same manner that radio has
meant the destitution of local music in our Buffalo example.  While it
is true that the net could be used as an archival site for regionally
specific culture, this seems outside its purview.  Couched in the
<cite>Agenda</cite>'s language of "best" and "greatest" is the belief
that "art" means images from the Louvre, not ballads from Appalachia.
In addition to the problems of what is and will be available in the
globalized community of the <cite>Agenda</cite>, there is the more
interesting notion of what the <cite>Agenda</cite> calls "universal
access."  Following a vow to promote private-sector ownership of the net,
the <cite>Agenda</cite> articulates its second objective which reads:

Extend the 'universal service' concept to ensure that
information resources are available to all at

empowerment -- and employment -- the government has a

Age.<sup><a name="ref36"

As a matter of fundamental fairness, this nation cannot

would emphasize giving all Americans who desire it,
easy, affordable access to advanced communications and
information services, regardless of income, disability,
or location.<sup><a name="ref37"

As with Gingrich, "affordable access" to the emergent medium is made
available to all. But what these official promoters have failed to
recognize is that access by itself is meaningless and unimportant.

There are, however, political gains of all sorts in the promotion of
access to information as a social curative.  Political thinking about
the net is most often condensable to this: "If we give welfare mothers
laptops they can get their benefits and do their shopping online and
we can end the wasteful bureaucracies of Food Stamps and WIC; after
access they shouldn't be found asking for better schools because the
best courses and teachers are already online; and they won't need
better ways of holding their elected officials accountable -- protests
and boycotts now being irrelevant -- because dissent can now be sent
neatly to Congress electronically."  In this system a mere feeling of
representation in a community must replace actual representation.

As with radio's early promoters, the <cite>Agenda</cite> promises
classlessness in an information age: "It can ameliorate the constraints of
geography and economic status, and give all Americans a fair opportunity
to go as far as their talents and ambitions will take them."<sup><a
name="ref38" href="radio-lessons.html#foot38">38</a></sup>  "Ameliorating constraints" is
code for effacing real class difference.

"Democracy" in the <cite>Agenda</cite>, as in Arnheim's
radio, means the act of consuming.  Vice President Al Gore, in his
contribution to the <cite>Agenda</cite>, goes so far as to say, "We can
design a customer-driven electronic government."<sup><a name="ref39"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot39">39</a></sup>  Those without the technology, or without the
opportunity to learn how to use this very class-bound technology, are left
without representation in his electronic government.  This conflation
of the consumer with the voter can do nothing to realize any genuine
democratic potential of the net.  Again, the implication is that one
must be buying the emergent medium to have representation.

<font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2" color="#996699">

A similar kind of virtual/consumptive inclusion is evident in
the assertion of community on the net.  Howard Rheingold's <cite>The
Virtual Community</cite> (1994) offers an excellent reference for
this new community spirit as embodied in the WELL of San Francisco (a
typical fee-based computer network).  The need for a fulfilling sense of
community was so strong among the WELL's creators that its 1985 design
goals included the credo: "[The WELL] would be a community."<sup><a
name="ref40" href="radio-lessons.html#foot40">40</a></sup>  The conception of the electronic
space as community existed before the space did.  Even the name "WELL,"
is a forced acronym designed to evoke an image of a traditional village
resource.  It stands for "Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link."

<P>


<font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2" color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>


Included in those goals was the belief that the WELL should be
profit making.  In trying to realize this goal the virtual value of
electronic community becomes apparent; in telling the history of the WELL
Rheingold invokes one of the WELL's architects, Matthew McClure, whose
vision was to "facilitate communications among interesting people" at
"a revolutionary low price":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->

<Pre>
To reach a critical mass, [the architects] knew they
would need to start with interesting people having
conversations at a somewhat more elevated level than
the usual BBS stuff. In Matthew's words, "We needed a
collection of shills who could draw the suckers into
the tents." So we invited a lot of interesting people,
gave them free accounts, called them "hosts," and
encouraged them to re-create the atmosphere of a Paris
salon -- a bunch of salons.<sup><a name="ref41"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot41">41</a></sup></pre><!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The virtual community of the net is artificial even on its own terms: the
communal feeling did not grow out of shared interests, but was formed by
bribes, discount prices, and contrived social interaction. Its "community"
was a commodity the WELL's creators could then market like any other.

<P>


<font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2" color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>


But in spite of the celebration of the WELL as the new informal
meeting place, a space that has replaced the pub, the cafe, and the
park, Rheingold somehow manages to claim that the highest achievement
for his electronic community is its ability to transport the user to
yet another community.  He describes the WELL as "a small town" with
"a doorway that opens onto the blooming, buzzing confusion of the
Net."<sup><a name="ref42" href="radio-lessons.html#foot42">42</a></sup>  Movement, not
destination is the real
goal.  This reveals that the net has clearly not replaced the corner
coffee shop in that its greatest achievement is always transporting
the user out of a community, leaving whenever a community promises to
become recognizable or delineable.  No real community, in the sense of
actual interaction or exchange of something (ideas, goods, etc.) is ever
sufficient.  Clearly the promise of connection is more important than what
is being connected to, this is the impulse that led to the virtualization
of the idea of community in the first place.  The eagerness to abandon
and move on, rather than to work in and develop a community, mirrors
the promise of that first radio ad: the better world is always just
through the next gateway, ready-made and without those noisy neighbors.
It also reveals that a buffet of choices is more important than developing
the potential of the options or spaces already available.  This is the
same thinking that promises 500-channel television.<sup><a name="ref43"

Despite utopian rhetoric's complicity with monopoly capitalism and its
actual denial of real democracy, community, and educational opportunity in
promising their virtual equivalents, there may yet be value in the utopian
expression of the emergent media.  The value certainly does not exist
in the "electronic commons" promised by the <cite>Agenda</cite>,<sup><a
name="ref44" href="radio-lessons.html#foot44">44</a></sup> any more than it existed in
the almost identical "America's Town Meeting of the Air" of the RCA of
the 1930's.<sup><a name="ref45" href="radio-lessons.html#foot45">45</a></sup>  In light
of past failures, I would like to argue for a smarter, more aware, set
of ideas to guide our thinking, a set of ideas conscious of the material
realities of the "information age" and the Internet that does not pretend
"affordable access" is social penicillin.

<P>


<font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2" color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>


To do this I would like to return to Enzensberger whose theory
of the media may yet unlock any real potential for social change that
might exist in the net.  Enzensberger would not have us see in emergent
media a panacea or a pacifier for the disenfranchised, but the power to
"mobilize."  This mobilization is not the virtual movement of telnetting
from San Francisco to Milan, nor is it access to the Library of Congress
at affordable prices.  It is the mobilization of production -- that
is, a public identified as producers, not consumers.  Any democratic
potential in an emergent medium must lie in its ability to facilitate
the organization of non-virtual politics, not in vacuuming political
action into itself.

<P>


<font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2" color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>


On only a few occasions have I experienced a glimmer of this kind
of mobilization: the February 1995 "Freely Espousing" multi-city
demonstration against cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts,
the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting.  Protests and marches were planned and the net was
used to help organize them and arrange their simultaneous occurrence.
Distribution lists such as POETICS were used to provide information used
for speeches and posters, and texts of angry letters were posted to be
downloaded and mailed to politicians.  It must be emphasized however
that this example does not address "access" as an issue of class and
shows the net being used for mobilization by people on the cultural
margins but not the economically disenfranchised.

<P>


<font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2" color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>


Other, primarily aesthetic, versions of this mobilization exist within
the net.  Mobilization on the net happens around textual poaching,<sup><a
name="ref46" href="radio-lessons.html#foot46">46</a></sup> the reinflection of texts
already generated by the medium in order to elaborate new meanings or
uses to discrete users.  The Anti-hegemony Project<sup><a name="ref47"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot47">47</a></sup> poached texts and formats from news oriented
usergroups to illustrate the vacuity of traditional news coverage and
to poke fun at the group of writers spontaneously involved in producing
the Project.  Also, the currently difficult to regulate transfers of
information (if not ownership and access) of the net facilitate valuable
copyright violations which occasionally make available everything from
philosophical texts to pornography otherwise locked up by publishing
company capitalism and intellectual property law.  But as the technology
of information control and intellectual property law evolve to service
the needs of private enterprise these useful moments will doubtlessly
become more scarce.

<P>


<font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2" color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>


But in spite of these moments of genuine productive potential and
sparks of mobilization, the current system of ownership and management
of access generally renders the productive activity on the net framed
by consumption on all sides.  In order to produce anything, whether news
story or parody, we must not only buy a modem but access time for every
minute of our productive activity.  The argument can be made that there
are costs of consumption involved in every productive activity.  But the
one-time purchase of a computer or typewriter, and the continuous cost
of paper to print on, are minimal (and get less and less significant over
time) when compared to the 3 dollar an hour (plus extras) charge of most
access providers.  And interestingly, the vast majority of information
produced on the net (the writing of user groups and chat rooms) already
seems to revolve almost exclusively around other consumptive activities:
the consumption of goods or of other media products.  And further, it
must be restated that the cultural community or democracy of the net,
in so far as it consists of a collection of producing subjects, is still
extremely class bound.  Observing that a kind of creative enfranchisement
exists for those with the money and the education to use the net does
not minimize the efficacy of our critique of the Gingrichian classless
democracy proclaimed by Internet promoters.

Corporate ownership of the media, says Enzensberger, is simply
antithetical to a conception of citizen-as-producer and only affords
the most co-opted and simulated form of production:

To this end, the men who own the media have developed
special programmes which are usually called "Democratic
Forum" or something of the kind.  There, tucked away in
the corner, the reader(listener/viewer) has his say,
which can naturally be cut short at any time. As is the
case of public opinion polling, he is only asked
questions so that he may have a chance to confirm his
own dependence. It is a control circuit where what is
fed in has already made complete allowance for the
feedback.<sup><a name="ref48"
href="radio-lessons.html#foot48">48</a></sup></pre><!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The responsible role then for those in possession of the technology
of use is to insure not a universal access to what has already been
produced, but to insure a universal knowledge of media production
which grows out of, and contributes to, an understanding of material
social relations.  This means more than simply making the economic and
class realities of human relations more central to the subjects of the
media; it means actually using the media to enact a change in material
circumstances.  Revolutionaries of all stripes learned this decades
ago, hence broadcasting centers are always the first things seized in
a political overthrow.

Neither the Internet, nor radio, is some kind of <i>deus ex
machina</i> of democracy, community, or education.  The net is only
an emergent medium, existing in a specific context with a real set
of material confines, and possibly with a real potential.  But it is a
potential that will remain unrealized if we allow the drive to virtualize
to obscure its material base and the economic realities of our culture.

<a name="foot2" href="radio-lessons.html#ref2">2</a>. Enzensberger's career as a writer,
broadcaster and critic spans various genres and addresses various
audiences.  After having attended several German Universities as well as
the Sorbonne, Enzensberger could have easily entered academe, but he chose
initially to engage with the world on a more populist level.  He joined
Radio Stuttgart and began producing radio essays.  During years of radio
work, journalism, writing poetry and criticism, and guest lecturing
in the 1950's and 1960's, Enzensberger evolved as a protegee of the
Frankfurt School.  In 1964, on the event of his first public address
as the poet-in-residence at Frankfurt University, he was introduced
by Theodor Adorno.  His works of criticism, poetry, novels and plays
interrogate a broad range of topics (Spanish anarchism, cultural progress
and barbarism, documentary fieldwork, communication technology, etc.) and
have always been informed by political analysis.  In 1968 he gave up a
fellowship at Wesleyan University and left the United States in protest of
the Vietnam War.  Hans Magnus Enzensberger, <cite>Critical Essays</cite>,
ed. R. Grimm and B. Armstrong with a forward by J. Simmon (New York:
Continuum, 1982) xi-xv.  "Constituents of a Theory of the Media" serves
as both a series of observations about the genuine potential of emergent
media and as a site of utopian hyperbole about emergent media, it
therefore makes  an excellent point of departure for our discussion.

use of radio by fascist European governments at this time.  It only took a
few casual references to Nazi Germany to create a popular fear of the idea
public ownership (government management) of radio in America.  This fear
of fascism was used by Sarnoff and others to stall the regulatory efforts
of the FCC.  For an example of this fear of government managed media see

the American public gets the programming it wants (and can thus blame
no one but itself for the banality of mass culture); the reality is
that the American public gets programming calculated to attract the
"commodity audience" with limited concern for what most [people]
actually desire." (Henry Jenkins, <cite>Textual Poachers</cite> [New

<a name="foot46" href="radio-lessons.html#ref46">46</a>. Henry Jenkins, in his <cite>Textual
Poachers</cite>, provides a useful model and vocabulary in his discussion
of TV series fans as producers of a kind of cultural community.  Fans of
<cite>Star Trek</cite> pirate stories and characters from the series to
produce new stories in fanzines, songs and videos.  Armed with copyright
attorneys the owners of the series object to this appropriation.
Fanzines draw attacks from Hollywood because they short-circuit the
desired distribution and consumption of a product: new products with
roots in an old series are distributed without any involvement of, or
profit to, network TV or Hollywood.  But because the commodity of the
net is different from that of Hollywood or network TV -- it is access or
means of consumption/distribution not an image or story -- the poaching
metaphor must be deployed differently to describe would-be alternative
culture on the net.  Since the "text" in the case of the net is access,
"poaching" would resemble something like stealing blocks of AOL time
for non-profit or anarchist purposes.
