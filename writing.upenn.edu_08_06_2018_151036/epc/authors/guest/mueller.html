          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>“Understanding what 
            it means to understand music.”  This sentiment from Barbara Guest’s 
            poem “Dissonance Royal Traveller” (<i>Defensive Rapture</i>, Sun &amp; 
            Moon Press, 1993) could have easily been a remark of Wittgenstein’s.  
            For to phrase the project in this way, as not merely understanding 
            music but understanding what that means, is to echo the characteristic 
            Wittgensteinian emphases in the study of language and experience.  
            Thus, if we want to determine the criteria for understanding music, 
            we need to look at what this means in linguistic practice, we need 
            to look at the language-game of music.  We need to ask how people 
            react to music, for instance, what goes on in the encounter, from 
            where does a passage of music come, in what situations.  Music as 
            a language-game, as a game that will shed light on how language works.  
            Indeed, as Wittgenstein says, understanding a musical theme is more 
            like understanding a sentence than we think.<a

            Understanding, epistemology</span>—<span style='font-size:11.0pt'>these 
            are the prey in Guest’s hunt for musical quiddity.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We can better see 
            why Wittgenstein is interested in music if we consider its relevance 
            to one of his central insights, and that is the realization that our 
            ordinary language, just as it is, adequately and solely constitutes 
            human experience.  What this suggests is that experience, or most 
            kinds of experience, are not pre-constituted in the mind as mental 
            processes.  Wittgenstein took great pains to exorcise this illusion 
            of certain kinds of inner intention.  He looked at meaning and understanding 
            from every possible angle and showed that they are not so piloted 
            in inwardness, that as processes, and as facts, actions, they are 
            outwardly expressive; being shareable, they are shareable.  Thus Wittgenstein 
            states, “Nothing is more wrong-headed than calling meaning a mental 
            activity.”<a
href="mueller.html#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  
            It is not as if we begin with inner pictures of reality, and then 
            produce our sentences.  If we say a rose is red in the dark, it does 
            not follow that we have a mental image of a red rose in the dark.  
            How can we, for the rose is invisible?<a href="mueller.html#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  
            We say the rose is red.  Significantly, it is music that places the 
            difficulty, in a remark of Wittgenstein’s.  He says (and I paraphrase): 
            “Say a sentence and think it; say it with understanding.  Now do it 
            without saying the sentence.  Sing a tune with expression.  Now express 
            it without singing.”<a href="mueller.html#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  
            It is not natural to do so; it is not part of the language-game.  
            Insofar as hearing or performing music is not well-described when 
            described in terms of inner processes, so our understanding of sentences 
            does not necessarily depend on those same inner processes.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Music is a language-game.  
            Think of hearing music as a practice, as a learned activity, and as 
            a form of life in which the significance of a musical phrase is determined 
            by its use.  This “use,” for Wittgenstein, is undoubtedly important; 
            use is the chief criterion for meaning.  We can also add related criteria: 
            context or surrounding circumstances, and mastery of the language.  
            In this last criterion, to say that we know what something means is 
            simply to say that we understand English, or that we understand music 
            in its different modes.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What I now want to 
            say is that for Barbara Guest understanding what it means to understand 
            music is, in effect, participating in a language-game, looking at 
            these criteria of meaning.  So she is in the poem.  She enters the 
            poem, “Dissonance Royal Traveller,” by entering into this language-game.  
            She unveils her usual sky-pattern of images and phrases and interpolates 
            references to music.  The pattern supplies the context.  And within 
            it, for the most part, there is an absence of complete sentences.  
            Therefore none of the hard logical effort that does not help toward 
            understanding, but instead an associative dynamic.  The words at times 
            echo one another loosely, or even remotely, and at times they supply 
            what the poet is looking for when she proposes understanding what 
            it means to understand music; they supply a context for this activity:</span></p>

          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>To be sure, the “this” 
            which accompanies our hearing music is indefinite and has various 
            referents.  I would just like to point to one, the aroma of scarlet 
            on the opposite side of the earth.  This is a context for hearing 
            music, a context of spirituality, of solemn church modes.  Thus, for 
            me, scarlet suggests the cloth worn by state or religious officials, 
            the judge’s scarlet or the scarlet of the Roman cardinals.  Let us 
            look at what comes next in this development of context: the angelic 
            sleeve of heaven and the diabolical hoof of earth.  This sounds like 
            spiritual warfare.  The sleeve of heaven is a token placed by the 
            Christian knight on his armor, just as the knight of Romance when 
            dressed for battle would bear the removable sleeve of his lady.  These 
            associations (church modes, spirit, Medievalism, tokens) are clearly 
            historical, even anachronistic, but (Guest insists) they accompany, 
            they surround, our hearing music.  They are circumstances, invitational 
            props.  They suggestively direct the path of music.  Of course, when 
            we think of aroma, we think of coffee, and Wittgenstein’s problem 
            of how to describe the aroma of coffee.  But music also has an aroma, 
            an atmosphere, which we approach indirectly, through context and through 
            language proficiency.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Establishing this 
            context is not all.  There is a further procedure, which Wittgenstein 
            would call studying grammar.  The grammar of the situation for Guest 
            is something like what accompanies our hearing music, and it is natural 
            to think to, to share in the guise of, two operative terms, namely, 
            consonance and dissonance.  Guest thinks these terms.  They become 
            these terms, thematized, as analogy and image.  Hence the phrase “consonant 
            as water,” or water with its listening oars into which music disappears.  
            The comparison to water is apt because water, like music, is a phenomenon, 
            and eludes mentally-based description.  Water as it slips does not 
            afford a logical picture in the mind.  Water as it slips adds to the 
            atmosphere of understanding music.  As we have shown, the order of 
            the scarlet wedding, the ceremony of heaven and earth, is another 
            part of this atmosphere.  Collectively, these images create a continuum 
            of consonance, a kind of changeable order which will change once again 
            once the contrary, dissonance, makes its mark:</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>dissonance 
            may abandon <i>miserere</i></span></p>

            bruised knee hasten to the idol.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Thus the solemnity 
            of the sacred masses, the “<i>miserere</i>,” accompanies our hearing 
            music but only by way of a countervailing anticipation of dissonance 
            with its own heathen idolatry.  This is a shift, startling and transforming, 
            a shift in musical practice, a shift in what it means to understand 
            music.  This is perhaps revolutionary.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What we have in “Dissonance 
            Royal Traveller,” I would thus assert, is a sensitive explanation 
            of music which bypasses <i>a priori</i> formulations.  Music is not 
            a feeling in our minds.  It is its place in the history of its practice.  
            What does music express?  It expresses itself, to quote Wittgenstein,<a href="mueller.html#_edn5" name="_ednref5"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> 
            its own structure, its own evolution.  Music takes place in a stream 
            of activity.  Its foundation is an outer process, a procession before 
            the mind, and a rapidly approaching conviction of dissonance.</span></p>

          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Up to this point the

          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is one of many 
            remarks by Wittgenstein on the color red wherein he imagines, among 
            other things, that red cannot be pointed out to someone without that 
            person’s prior knowledge of the language, of what the word color means, 
            for example.  Thus despite the sensual immediacy of our encounter 
            with “red,” our knowing red is a learned activity based on linguistic 
            practice just like anything else.  So it just might be possible, against 
            all expectation, to speak about a historically based ascendancy of 
            one color, the summit of all colors, just as we do about musical styles, 
            the disappearance of old church modes.  Agreement on what is red and 
            the knowledge, the mere knowledge of red, are epistemological problems 
            and are grand in the conclusions of Guest’s poem.  They are a part 
            of understanding what it means to understand music, but not so fast.  
            Hence the allusion to Wittgenstein, to the old church modes, and to 
            the role of the triad.  The practice of music in its passing is what 
            Guest sees as being abandoned by dissonance; the “old” practices that 
            secure what music is, that express what we mean by music, these are 
            abandoned by new modes that are magnified and kept in motion (“dissonance 
            royal traveller”).  The subject forms, and the partial account of 
            what music means for its understanding, do not go away; they become 
            subject to play, to the rule and grammar of dissonance, which they 
            weepingly breast and shift to the side.</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Until this resumptive 
            point, Guest has been a tactful music theorist, but that has changed 
            by virtue of her bringing in color, which offers a problematic distinction: 
            between the color red, and a something that is red.  The color red 
            persists even if the red object is destroyed.  Red is an ideal form, 
            and so on.  Now Wittgenstein, in privileging ordinary language, cedes 
            to a gap between language and the structure of reality.  There is 
            a limit to what language can do.  In the crushing final line of the 
            poem, I would assert, Guest crashes through this barrier; she states, 
            “altered the red saddle.”  There is an acting upon the object, and 
            red is an inseparable component of this object.  Meanwhile dissonance, 
            an aspect of music, contributes to this charge.  Thus Guest redefines 
            music as an accretion of thingness, the truth of its being what it 
            is.  And what music means is merely the position of its vector in 
            its own unfolding.  In certain states, in certain contexts, music 
            is known, music is apprehended as something different, as a reality 
            reconstituted.</span></p>

            of that latest of Plato’s dialogues, the accultured Athenian, comes 
            to the curious belief-belife that the constitution of the just society 
            is not finally the work of the legislator.  Great pains are taken 
            in the course of the lengthy discussions to establish that the state, 
            if it is to survive as such, and so the actions of its leaders and 
            important officials, must be grounded on certain virtues and on a 
            knowledge of the most important things, the nature of justice, of 
            goodness and of the soul among them; and to determine which is the 
            most important of these criteria, and in what way, and how the vital 
            basis of the enactment and execution of “laws” is to be found and 
            acquired.  It is arguable, though not entirely clear, that in the 
            mind of the principal in the dialogue, the Athenian, it is the poet, 
            or someone like the poet or some similar source from within the emerging 
            just and well-grounded cultural construct, who by means of enlightenment 
            and education brings about the desired result; by leading and guiding 
            the participants in the experiment of forming a new polity that is 
            the very experience of human actions, and doing so by being the principal 
            lights for all participants and actors who in such a situation would 
            otherwise have a difficult time of it.  Perhaps it is the author’s 
            own <i>Laws</i> that might be imagined by the Athenian speaker, the 
            one advocating the process, as performing this kind of “poetic,” guiding 
            function.  Sheer determined instruction and analysis are not it at 
            all, in other words.  That is to say that there is, in the hoped-for 
            learning of just practice, a charm, a particular charm, that begins 
            with exuberance and that supplies throughout some measure of the beautiful 
            in the superabundant goodness that the good legislator would embody, 
            should there be any hope the emerging state will thrive.</span></p>

            enlightening Plato would seem to anticipate the anguished concern 
            registered by the less confident poet Mallarmé, in “L’Azur,” having 
            to do with an apparent inability to “<i>attifer la sanglotante idée</i>.”  
            The poet Barbara Guest shows no such fear.  She is thoroughly at ease 
            with the foundations of orderliness and best culture.  Remark her 
            signature poem, “An Emphasis Falls on Reality,” where she deftly processes, 
            realizes and nuances the long-celebrated Platonic theory of forms.  
            The concept-tossed “apparition” in line 10 of that poem returns, nobly 
            and crucially, in <i>Quill, Solitary</i>  Apparition, where the contemplation 
            of Plato’s discourse concerning the ideal registers hints of a still

            fourth, but we have to do it since the poet of  “Pallor” is so sided 
            on the (non)concept that “water is missing the fourth chord.”  Of 
            course, in one sense this is an urging of our actant to construct 
            a “fourth wall” and thereby construct experience and refigure the 
            markings on the wall of Plato’s cave à la Guest’s earlier poem; but 
            what else might it be?  For the moderns, it is always something else.  
            This is not a making light of Plato’s coming out to the Forms and 
            to true understanding; it is simply a telling of “[w]ithdrawal from 
            the conceptual line,” a derivation, or moving away from the clear 
            stream, or moving away from shore, to “‘somewhere other than observable 
            water’,” but not just the idea of water, or even the matter of water 
            circumfusing a tyranny of the idea, as such that would for Mallarmé

            Harmony within translates to harmony without.  The state, the community,

            soul, as if this living community were an individuality with a soul,

            and persons who embody these virtues towards the laws would happily 
            possess the goodness of the soul, a goodness and empowerment which, 
            as has been demonstrated (in Book II), comes about by beautiful education, 
            that is to say, education in music!  The bars and struts of a moral 
            foundation are the discord (or dissonance) and concord (or consonance) 
            of music, and the fortunate would be a kind of harmony: for Plato, 
            whether too forcefully or not too forcefully projecting concord at 
            the expense of dissonance: for Barbara Guest, some realization perhaps 
            some definition of music which I would forthrightly suggest neither 
            you nor I would be able to or would want to explain in so many words, 
            but which lies in the pleasure we seek in at least the two poems “Dissonance

            musical or poetic judgement of the informed and informing citizen 
            above the age of sixty.  The discussion in Book II of Plato’s <i>Laws</i> 
            regarding musical training is tricky, or if not tricky evasive, and 
            the age markers slide up and down, but suffice it to say that musical 
            training of the sort that will lead ultimately to a situation of political 
            justice requires the presence of experienced choristers.  The interest

            of the community in its beautiful formation and musical training are 
            choirs slotted into phases by age, whereby the first choir, the choir 
            of boys, is sacred to the Muses (Book II; 664c); the second choir, 
            of men under thirty, is sacred to Apollo the god of healing (Book 
            II, 664c); and the third choir, ages thirty to sixty, is sacred to 
            Dionysus (Book II; 664d-667c and following).  Songs, or choric songs, 
            the Athenian seems to say, regulate the education toward goodness 
            for, in the first place, the choir of boys, and it is apparent that 
            they do so on two grounds.  First, boys cannot help moving, so choric 
            songs direct and train their movements while the melodies provide 
            the pleasure that excites their movement in the first place.  Secondly, 
            the songs are “good” songs, the same good songs that are sung by the 
            choir of young men, dedicated to Apollo, and the choir of middle-aged 
            to older men, dedicated to Dionysus, and the continuity of the choric 
            song practice, which is the practice of the harmonizing and concord 
            of body and soul, thus ensures the maintenance of goodness in the 
            continuing life of the happy state from generation to generation.  
            Now the “men” in the third phase, from age thirty to age sixty, need 
            the extra symposial pleasure of banqueting and drinking in order to 
            cheer up and feel like joining in the singing, while the singing is 
            the production of goodness for dancing and singing enthusiasts of 
            all ages, and of goodness for a state or polity that wishes to remain 
            a state, that will not disintegrate or become prey to conflict, that 
            will be a standard against evil-doings and corruption.  But the Dionysian 
            symposiasts are not just drinkers and singers (they are permitted 
            the greatest consumption of wine), but more importantly they are educators 
            and leaders (<i>see</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Book II, 670c-671a).  The training 
            of boys and men in their respective </span><span style='font-size:

            to include the training of the legislator himself, so that the Dionysus-adhering 
            music teacher and poet would seem to have a claim of priority in the 
            establishing of a just polity.  Not only that, but the best musician/poet 
            is also the best drinker, being a drinker who understands and practices 
            moderation, and is therefore in great demand and is greatly needed 
            for curbing and guiding the rest of the Dionysus-adhering citizens 
            who are not so inspired and who are thus prone to drinking to excess 
            (and, we may imagine, dancing and singing rather too boisterously) 
            (Book II, 671a-e).  We alluded above to the slipperiness of Plato’s 
            character leading the colloquy; and so at this point in the argument 
            it is significant and not uncalculated that the Athenian blurs his 
            dancer categories a bit, or continues to do so.  More and more as 
            the Athenian describes these musical teachers, more and more does 
            he advance the levels of their experience and age, until finally it 
            would appear that among these educators and princes of music and drinking 
            are those who are beyond the age of sixty (Book II, 671e).</span></p>

            As to their “concordant” experience urging their presence as chorus

            to be a noteworthy extension of italicized “<i>pallor</i>” (as quoted 
            above from the poem’s last page) to trembling, stirring, shaking; 
            that is to say, through dialectical disturbance of concord and dissonance 
            shaking the water, muddying it a bit, adding dimension, adding a fourth 
            chord, stirring or shaking.  In its clear, conceptually pure phase, 
            water is as “harbor,” is as safety and routine and ennui, and is blocked.  
            Against this trapping is required “pallor” as the making up of new 
            consistency, history “rouged,” of actions, existence, less of harbor.  
            So pallor has the pale side of the Platonic apparition or invisible 
            reality and clear color by its self-named mixing; and then also this 
            wan pallor has the in-mixing opposite muscular and ruddy side of this 
            tremor-stirred dissonance and plenty—configured, let us suppose, in 
            Pallas Athena, Queen of the Air, and of Clouds.</p>

          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Perhaps the feeling 
            is that what we would want to do today is get out from under the empire 
            and grips of structuralism to, among other things, a comparative mythology 
            that is part structural and part fantastical; and therein (in structure 
            and merriment and imagination and (some) exaggeration) lies the attraction 
            to Barbara Guest of John Ruskin.  It is no accident; Mr. Ruskin celebrates 
            Athena, celebrates the mythologies.  And he does so spiritedly in 
            the published University College lectures of March 1869, where he 
            “moralizes” the potency of Athena for her Greek emulants as Queen 
            of the Air, but seems as much interested in the Hermes and Athena 
            pair (we know him as Mercury), our adoptable favorites the <i>mythicae 
            potestates clarae</i></span>—<span style='font-size:11.0pt'>of air, 
            clouds and transmission from and between</span>—<span style='font-size:11.0pt'>of 
            (perhaps) water.  Why is all this so strong?  In Barbara Guest’s “Pallor,” 
            second page (p. 38), “azure,” italicized twice, pours down its emphasis, 
            as the American equivalent and cognate of blue sky, French “l’azur,” 
            so haunting to Mallarmé.  Mercury, with clouds, is in on “<i>azure</i> 
            delicately blotted,” and the poem chimes on fountains, so earth to 
            sky, but as a humanities veneration, why the water is muddied to surrender 
            to the institution of the fourth chord.</span></p>

            of May, 1869, I am writing where my work was begun thirty-five years 
            ago, within sight of the snows of the higher Alps. [footnote reference 
            omitted]  In that half of the permitted life of man, I have seen strange 
            evil brought upon every scene that I best loved, or tried to make 
            beloved by others. [footnote reference omitted]  The light which once 
            flushed those pale summits with its rose at dawn, and purple at sunset,

            all their golden crags with azure is now defiled with languid coils 
            of smoke, belched from worse than volcanic fires; their very glacier 
            waves are ebbing, and their snows fading, [footnote reference omitted] 
            as if Hell had breathed on them; the waters that once sank at their 
            feet into crystalline rest are now dimmed and foul, from deep to deep, 
            and shore to shore.  These are no careless words—they are accurately—horribly—true.

          <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The triumph of “Pallor” 
            (however guarded, and bearing in mind my assumption for present purposes 
            that the poem triumphs uniquely, whereas in fact it is part of a book-length 
            sequence) lies in the realization of the nature of water as to “its 
            fourth chord” in the context of classically mythological resonance 
            and high imagination.  Thus the poem harkens to discovery and dissemination 
            or dispersion, explained in one instance in terms of “Venus and errata.”  
            It is possible to see (at the bottom of page 43 leading to the poem’s 
            last page) the dissonant bone-like structure, which is both vertebrae/spine 
            structure and no doubt structure of music/musical staff with criss-crossing 
            notes, to see this image as the birth of Venus-as-Aphrodite, in sea 
            “foam” (&#945;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;), “<i>a fourth chord</i> in 
            the waist length hair.”  The dispersion, based, always remember, on 
            the magic of dissonance, seems to be clapped on a concurrence of Athena 
            Queen of the Air with Venus of Water, an arousal effectuated “mercurially,” 
            creating the “abrupt dispersion,” the “flight into absence” (“Pallor,” 
            p. 39).  Mercury, or Hermes, as thief, messenger, enabler, is cloud-god, 
            dimming “azure,” softening it through discordance.  But how so Athena?  
            Because of her “fourth” attribute in Ruskin: “Temperance, (patience 
            under trial by pleasure).”<a href="mueller.html#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span

            Potencies of Athena, working hand in hand, restate temperance for 
            which you need pleasure, pleasure for which you need the intensifying 
            pressure of temperance.  Despite Ruskin’s heavy-handed morality later 
            in the talk (with Plato as escort), by which the music of Athena in 
            league with Apollo figures as the sun-music of harmony and order in 
            contrast with the degraded music of the “expression of ultimate vice 
            … for ever sunk into discordance or silence,”<a

            the fourth chord of water, in the form to which I am now speaking 
            of educated musicality, is contrapuntal resumption reclarified of 
            harmony and dissonance.  It is for this that the pallor dissembles, 
            at first; and if for this aspect, if for rephased concordance, Mercury 
            or Hermes draws, it is cloud in azure.  It is also muddiness in water, 
            springing in its conceptual restitution from the <i>idea</i> of water, 
            the “‘other than observable water’,” which is absence, “somewhere 
            other than here,” because, for one, dissonance is the absence of harmony.  
            We resolve “fountain eelings” into “feelings” and “feelings” into 
            “fountain eelings.”  We resolve absence into absence, and back again; 
            and we do so because of, or because we are, pallor; we are intellectually 
            resolved into air</span>—<span

            In Plato’s <i>Laws</i>, the course of musical and ethical education 
            comprises these tonalities as three phases presented as three choirs, 
            the last two respectively dedicating their practices to Apollo and 
            Dionysus.  Barbara Guest adds the appellation of “choir” or “chord,” 
            the Fourth Chord, to the further advanced group.  The Fourth Choir 
            are adherents of Athena.</span></p>

            to be sure, in Ruskin’s list of the goddess’ air-qualities, as opposed 
            to her virtues, there are five not four, and Athena’s emanation as 
            Pallas vibration of the air is last and fifth, not fourth.  And, at 
            the same time, one could surely find earlier and so so similarly forward-echoing 
            instances of “pallor” in many a text, and uncover a plush semantics 
            for pallor-sensitivities unjustly passed over here.  It is all a matter 
            of literary sources, but not precisely: the literary sources are, 
            in accurate and fully pleasuring terms, the points of reference for 
            the reader’s response, infinitely many points of reference for infinitely 
            many readers deservedly so.  Semantically open sites, the style-points 
            of not the only <i>modus operandi</i> to occur to Barbara Guest but 
            of an important one, register efficaciously like the devices of very

             He did not stop, and in the spirit of varying and enriching his world, 
            dwelt in and dwelt rather upon a delicately organized sequence and 
            range of topics, among them in Book III the figure of Mercury in the 
            brilliant poem 11, and then a bit later the “<i>fons Bandusiae</i>”

            as the poem goes on meanwhile, forgetting about its disturbed waters, 
            in the most beautiful and glowing terms.  But before we know it, before 
            we forget it, the brow of the kid-goat is bursting with young horns 
            (<i>cornibus primis</i>), whose goal in the world is war and love-hunting 
            (<i>venerem et proelia</i>).  But the harmony and clarity and efficaciousness 
            of Horace’s “fountain” remain undisturbed and inviolate, and for Horace 
            there is a charm his charm which succors even the lost souls (<i>e.g.</i>,

              There is reason based, in effect, on common sense to believe the 
              <i>Laws</i> to be the work of a period late in Plato’s life, but 
              you can well imagine how iffy any kind of assertion might be regarding 
              the timing of any one of these dialogues.  We may without much trouble, 
              however, rely on narrational sense.  Thus it is the vantage of acquired 
              time from which the thoughts of the Athenian character proceed in 
              the <i>Laws</i> that provides us with the sufficient going papers 
              for constructing a metaphorical and imaginative scheme by which 
              to sort through the musical stages of individual and communal development.  
              Hence making way for the Fourth Chord, and hence for wisdom and 
              a greater kind of insight, as I shall argue.</font></p>
