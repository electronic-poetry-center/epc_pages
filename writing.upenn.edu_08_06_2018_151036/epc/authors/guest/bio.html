Barbara Guest Bio Notes </font><p>

<p>

Born in 1920 in North Carolina, Barbara Guest spent her childhood in Florida and
California, and evidence of these varied places is revealed in her
poetry.

After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley, Barbara
Guest settled in New York City, where she became connected with the
equally emerging poets and Abstract-Expressionist artists of the New York
School, who were in turn to influence her poetry. For several years, she
reviewed art for <i>Art News,</i> and continued to write about painting in
that magazine and in <i>Art and America.</i> Painting and its allied arts
have remained a constant in her poetry, particularly through her
continuing collaborations with artists. She died on February 15, 2006, in Berkeley, where she has lived, with her daughter Hadley, during the final years of her life.

Her first books of poetry, including <i>The Location of Things, Poems,</i>
and <i> The Blue Stairs,</i> were published in the 1960s. During the
1970s,
books such as <i>Moscow Mansions, The Countess from Minneapolis,</i> and,
in particular, a novel, <i>Seeking Air,</i> pointed to a sense of
structure moving in more varied and experimental directions. This was true
of her acclaimed biography of the poet H.D., <i>Herself Defined,</i> and
especially true of a major poem, <i>The T&uuml;rler Losses,</i> and of
<i>Biography,</i> a book of poetry published in 1980. <i>Fair Realism</i>
(1989) was followed within a year by <i>Musicality,</i> a collaboration
with artist June Felter, and <i>Defensive Rapture</i> (1990), of which a
critic observed that Guest was now "pushing the reader into the spiritual
and metaphysical possibilities of language itself."<p>

Guest has continued to publish prolifically during the 1990s, and her work
has been recognized by major awards and honors. A festschrift was held at
Brown University in her honor in 1993, and for two consecutive years (1995
and 1996), she received America Awards for literature from the
Contemporary Arts Council -- for her <i>Selected Poems</i> and for
<i>Quill, Solitary Apparition.</i> <i>Fair Realism</i> was awarded the
Lawrence Lipton Prize, and <i>Defensive Rapture</i> received the San
Francisco State University Poetry Award. In 1999, she was awarded the
Frost Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Poetry Society of America.
