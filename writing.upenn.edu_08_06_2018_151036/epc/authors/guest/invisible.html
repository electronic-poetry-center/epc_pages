&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    
There is an invisible architecture often
supporting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the surface of the poem, interrupting the progress of the
poem. It reaches <br>
into the poem<br>
in search for an identity with the poem,<br><br>

its object is to possess the poem for a brief time, even as an apparition
appears. An invisible architecture upholds the poem while allowing a
moment of relaxation for the unconscious.. A period of emotional
suggestion, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of lapse,<br>
of reliance on the conscious  substitute words pushed toward the bridge of
the
architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An architecture in the period
before the poem finds an exact form and vocabulary--,<p><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;before the visible, appearance of the poem on the page and the
invisible approach to its composition. Reaching out to develop the poem
there are
interruptions, some apparently for no reason -- something else is
happening
&nbsp;&nbsp;the poet has no control -- the poem begins to quiver, to
hesitate, to become insubstantial&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the desire
of poetry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to
elevate itself, to become stronger.. The poem is fragile.. It needs to
reach through the armed vehicle of the poem,<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to loosen the armed hand.<p>

Losing the arrogance of dominion over the poem to an invisible hand, the
poet
campaigns for a passage over which the poet has control. Yet the
unstableness
of the poem is important.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also the frequent lapses of control of the poem.<br>
The writer only slowly retains power over the poem, physical power, when
the
poem breaks away from the authority of the invisible
architecture.<p><br><br>

This invisible authority may be the unconscious that dwells on the
lower
level,<br>
in a substratum beneath the surface of the poem and possesses its own
reference. A fluidity only enters the poem when it becomes more openly
aware of
itself.<p><br>

By whom or by what agency is the behavior of the poem suggested, by what
invisible architecture, we ask, is the poem developed. The Surrealists
taught
us to wander freely on the page, releasing mechanical birds, if we so
desire,
to nest in the invisible handwriting of composition. There is always
something
within poetry that desires the invisible.<p><br>

The desire of the poet to control. This control was earlier destructive to
the
interior of the poem, to its infrastructure. There is something deliberate
about this practice of control by the conscious. It includes the question
that
is undefined, the behavior of the poem.  By whom or by what agency is this
decided, by what invisible architecture is the poem developed?<br><br>
