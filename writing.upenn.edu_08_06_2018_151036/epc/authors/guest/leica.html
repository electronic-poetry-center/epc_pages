Others about the embarking <br>
have reasons.<br> <br>


I holding shreds <br>
carpenter leavings.<br> <br>


Motions in the wind,<br>
wave rolling <br> <br>


disturb sad plots,<br>      
disturbing sad plots.<br> <br>


Desolate places <br>
on the grass <br>
where birds are a light,<br> <br>


Gather in midsummer,<br>
wood shingles,<br>
visionary house.<br> <br>


Taking glances <br>
from tree to eave,<br> <br>


bicyclist, car,<br>
dark green spots <br> <br>
     
for the movement <br>
of window.<br> <br>


Mowing bitter edges, too.<br> <br>


It passes,<br> 
whatever it is.<br> <br>
  
Sums.<br>
Day divided by night.<br>
Corn ears.<br> <br>


Whichever decides.<br> <br>
         
Constructed of film <br>               
splices.<br>
Day or night.<br> <br>
