    <TD>We expect poets to give a first-hand account of what poetry is. But 
      some poets, when they write criticism, produce a kind of prose that is 
      itself on the verge of being poetry. Valéry, Stevens and Marianne Moore 
      belong to this "visionary company." And so does Barbara Guest, whose 
      writings on poetry, collected here, are among the most inspiring works of 
      their kind. It is a deep pleasure to know that such writing can still 
      exist. 
      <P align=center>— John Ashbery*<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></TD></TR>

    <TD>In this companion to her important poetry, Barbara Guest may be said 
      to advance a poetics amazed in its dreaminess and lyrical in its critical 
      register. No wonder the Symbolist poetics from which she takes her core 
      meaning is as integral to her poetry as it is: it is the way she thinks! 
      Her aphoristic plasticity is affirmative, affirmative in performing 
      imaginative acts on our behalf.

    <TD>Guest has earned her formidable reputation through dedication to 
      modern lyric's difficult double-project of making song think and making 
      thought sing, of stretching the very medium of conceptual thought — 
      language — all the way toward music and affect, but without relinquishing 
      any of the rigor of conceptual intellection. The essays, talks and 
      addresses, and prose and verse meditations now gathered in Forces of 
      Imagination offer welcome points of entry into Guest's challenging 
      aesthetic.

    <TD>Writing about thinkers, poets and writers as diverse as Baudelaire, 
      Mallarmé, Plato, Walter Benjamin, Kant, Pasternak, Machado de Assis, H.D., 
      Horace, Wallace Stevens and Pound; about radical and conservative poetics, 
      modernism, postmodernism, the relationship between art and poetry; about 
      the importance of imagination and surprise in poetry, Barbara Guest 
      situates herself in a multi-faceted literary landscape spanning centuries 
      and continents, at the same time providing brilliant insights into the 
      roots and workings of contemporary poetry. This is an evocative collection 
      of essays and poems on writing that might be quite provocative to a 
      certain audience steeped in the poetics of academia. Fascinating reading 
      for anyone interested in the possibilities of modern writing.
