<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Charles Reznikoff is a poet of the eye. 
  To cross the threshold of his work is to penetrate the prehistory of matter, 
  to find oneself exposed to a world in which language has not yet been invented. 
  Seeing, in his poetry, always comes before speech. Each poetic utterance is 
  an emancipation of the eye, a transcription of the visible into the brute, the 
  unciphered code of being. The act of writing, therefore, is not so much an ordering 
  of the real as a discovery of it. It is a process by which one places oneself 
  between things and the names of things, a way of standing watch in this interval 
  of silence and allowing things to be seen — as if for the first time — and henceforth 
  to be given their names. The poet, who is the first man to be born, is also 
  the last. He is Adam, but he is also the end of all generations: the mute heir 
  of the builders of Babel. For it is he who must learn to speak from his eyes 
  — and cure himself of seeing with his mouth. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>The poem, then, not as a telling, but as 
  a taking hold. The world can never be assumed to exist. It comes into being 
  only in the act of moving towards it. <i>Esse est percipii</i>: no American 
  poet has ever adhered so faithfully to the Berkeleyan formula as Reznikoff. 
  It is more than just the guiding principle of his work — it is embedded into 
  the work, and it contains all the force of a moral dogma. To read Reznikoff 
  is to understand that nothing can be taken for granted: we do not find ourselves 
  in the midst of an already established world, we do not, as if by preordained 
  birthright, automatically take possession of our surroundings. Each moment, 
  each thing, must be earned, wrested away from the confusion of inert matter 
  by a steadiness of gaze, a purity of perception so intense that the effort, 
  in itself, takes on the value of a religious act. The slate has been wiped clean. 
  It is up to the poet to write his own book. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Tiny poems, many of them barely a sentence 
  long, make up the core of Reznikoff's work. Although his total output includes 
  fiction, biography, drama, long narrative poems, historical meditations, and 
  book-length documentary poems, these short lyrics are the Ur-texts of Reznikoff's 
  imagination: everything else follows from them. Notable for their precision 
  and simplicity, they also run counter to normal assumptions about what a poem 
  should aspire to be. Consider these examples: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <i><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>April</i> </p>
  <p>The stiff lines of the twigs<br>
    blurred by buds. </p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font><i>Moonlit Night</i> </p>
  <p>The trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns. </p>
  <p><i>The Bridge</i> </p>
  <p>In a cloud bones of steel. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>The point is that there is no point. At 
  least not in any traditional sense. These poems are not trying to drum home 
  universal truths, to impress the reader with the sill of their making, or to 
  invoke the ambiguities of human experience. Their aim, quite simply, is to clarify. 
  Of seeing and of speaking. And yet, the unsettling modestly of these poems should 
  not blind us to the boldness of their ambition. For even in these tiniest of 
  poems, the gist of Reznikoff's poetics is there. It is as much an ethics of 
  the poetic moment as it is a theory of writing, and its message never varies 
  in any of Reznikoff's work: the poem is always more than just a construction 
  of words. Art, then, for the sake of something — which means that art is almost 
  an incidental by-product of the effort to make it. The poem, in all instances, 
  must be an effort to perceive, must be a moving <i>outward</i>. It is less a 
  mode of expressing the world than it is a way of being in the world. Merleau-Ponty's 
  account of contemplation in <i>The Phenomenology of Perception</i> is a nearly 
  exact description of the process that takes place in a Reznikoff poem: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>. . . when I contemplate an object with the sole intention of watching it 
    exist and unfold its riches before my eyes, then it ceases to be an allusion 
    to a general type, and I become aware that each perception, and not merely 
    that of sights which I am discovering for the first time, re-enacts on its 
    own account the birth of intelligence and has some element of creative genius 
    about it: in order that I may recognize the tree as a tree, it is necessary 
    that, beneath this familiar meaning, the momentary arrangement of the visible 
    scene should begin all over again, as on the very first day of the vegetable 
    kingdom, to outline the individual idea of this tree. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Imagism, yes. But only as a source, not 
  as a method. There is no desire on Reznikoff's part to use the image as a medium 
  for transcendence, to make it quiver ineffably in some ethereal realm of the 
  spirit. The progress from symbolism to imagism to objectivism is more a series 
  of short circuits than a direct lineage. What Reznikoff learned from the Imagists 
  was the value — the force — of the image in itself, unadorned by the claims 
  of the ego. The poem, in Reznikoff's hands, is an act of image-ing, rather than 
  of imagining. Its impulse is away from metaphor and into the tangible, a desire 
  to take hold of what is rather than what is merely possible. A poem fit to the 
  measure of the perceived world, neither larger than this world nor smaller than 
  it. 'I see something,' Reznikoff stated in a 1968 interview with L. S. Dembo, 
  'and I put it down as I see it. In the treatment of it, I abstain from comment. 
  Now, if I've done something that moves me — if I've portrayed the object well 
  — somebody else will come along and say, "What the devil is this?" And maybe 
  they're both right.' </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>If the poet's primary obligation is to see, 
  there is a similar though less obvious injunction upon the poet — the duty of 
  not being seen. The Reznikoff equation, which weds seeing to invisibility, cannot 
  be made except by renunciation. In order to see, the poet must make himself 
  invisible. He must disappear, efface himself in anonymity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I like the sound of the street —<br>
    but I, apart and alone, <br>
    beside an open window <br>
    and behind a closed door </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>* <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>* <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>* 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I am alone— <br>
    and glad to be alone; <br>
    I do not like people who walk about <br>
    so late; who walk slowly after midnight<br>
    through the leaves fallen on the sidewalks. <br>
    I do not like <br>
    my own face <br>
    in the little mirrors of the slot-machines <br>
    before the closed stores. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>It seems no accident that most Reznikoff 
  poems are rooted in the city. For only in the modern city can the one who sees 
  remain unseen, take his stand in space and yet remain transparent. Even as he 
  becomes a part of the landscape he has entered, he continues to be an outsider. 
  Therefore: Objectivist. That is to say — to create a world around oneself by 
  seeing as a stranger would. What counts is the thing itself, and the thing that 
  is seen can come to life only when the one who sees is disappeared. There can 
  never be any movement toward possession. Seeing is the effort to create presence: 
  to possess a thing would be to make it vanish. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>And yet, it is as if each act of seeing 
  were an attempt to establish a link between the one who sees and the thing that 
  is seen. As if the eye were the means by which the stranger could find his place 
  in the world he has been exiled to. For the building of a world is above all 
  the building and recognition of relations. To discover a thing and isolate it 
  in its singularity is only a beginning, a first step. The world is not merely 
  an accumulation, it is a process — and each time the eye enters this world, 
  it partakes in the life of all the disparate things that pas before it. While 
  objectivity is the premise, subjectivity is the tacit organizer. As soon as 
  there is more than one thing, there is memory, and because of memory, there 
  is language: what is born in the eye, and nevertheless beyond it. In which, 
  and out of which, the poem. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>In his 1968 interview with Dembo, Reznikoff 
  went on to say: 'The world is very large, I think, and I certainly can't testify 
  to the whole of it. I can only testify to my own feelings; I can only say what 
  I saw and heard, and I try to say it as well as I can. And if your conclusion 
  is that what I saw and heard makes you feel the way I did, then the poem is 
  successful.' </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>New York was Reznikoff's home. It was a 
  city he knew as intimately as a woodcutter knows his forest, and in his prime 
  he would walk between ten and twenty miles a day, from Brooklyn to Riverdale 
  and back. Few poets have ever had such a deep feeling for city life, and in 
  dozens of brief poems Reznikoff captures the strange and transitory beauties 
  of the urban landscape. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This smoky winter morning—<br>
    do not despise the green jewel among the twigs<br>
    because it is a traffic light. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>* 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Feast, you who cross the bridge<br>
    this cold twilight<br>
    on these honeycombs of light, the buildings of Manhattan. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>* 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rails in the subway,<br>
    what did you know of happiness<br>
    when you were ore in the earth;<br>
    now the electric lights shine upon you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>But Reznikoff's attention is focused on 
  more than just the objects to be found in the city. He is equally interested 
  in the people who fill the streets of New York, and no encounter, however brief, 
  is too slight to escape his notice, too banal to become a source of epiphany. 
  These two examples, from among many possibilities: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was walking along Forty-Second Street as night was<br>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>falling.<br>
    On the other side of the street was Bryant Park. <br>
    Walking behind me were two men <br>
    and I could hear some of their conversation: <br>
    'What you must do,' one of them was saying to his<br>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>companion,<br>
    'is to decide on what you want to do <br>
    and then stick to it. Stick to it! <br>
    And you are sure to succeed finally.' <br>
  </p>
  <p> I turned to look at the speaker giving such good advice <br>
    and was not surprised to see that he was old, <br>
    But his companion <br>
    to whom the advice was given so earnestly, <br>
    was just as old; <br>
    and just then the great clock on top of a building across<br>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>the park </p>
  <p>began to shine. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>* 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The tramp with torn shoes<br>
    and clothing dirty and wrinkled —<br>
    dirty hands and face — <br>
    takes a comb out of his pocket<br>
    and carefully combs his hair. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>The feeling that emerges from these glimpses 
  of city life is roughly equivalent to what one feels when looking at a photograph. 
  Cartier-Bresson's 'decisive moment' is perhaps the crucial idea to remember 
  in this context. The important thing is readiness: you cannot walk out into 
  the street with the expectation of writing a poem of taking a picture, and yet 
  you must be prepared to do so whenever the opportunity presents itself. Because 
  the 'work' can came into being only when it has been given to you by the world, 
  you must be constantly looking at the world, constantly doing the work that 
  will lead to a poem even if no poem comes of it. Reznikoff walks through the 
  city — not, as most poets do, with 'his head in the clouds,' but with his eyes 
  open, his mind open, his energies concentrated on entering the life around him. 
  Entering it precisely because he is apart from it. And therefore this paradox, 
  lodged in the heart of the poem: to posit the reality of this world, and then 
  to cross into it, even as you find yourself barred at all its gates. The poet 
  as solitary wanderer, as man in the crowd, as faceless scribe. Poetry as an 
  art of loneliness. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>It is more than just loneliness, however. 
  It is exile, and a way of coming to terms with exile that somehow, for better 
  or worse, manages to leave the condition of exile intact. Reznikoff was not 
  only an outsider by temperament, nurturing those aspects of himself that would 
  tend to maintain his sense of isolation, he was also born into a state of <i>otherness</i>, 
  and as a Jew, as the son of immigrant Jews in America, whatever idea of community 
  he had was always ethnic rather than national (his dream as a poet was to go 
  across the country on foot, stopping at synagogues along the way to give reading 
  of his work in exchange for food and lodging). If his poems about the city — 
  his American poems, so to speak, dwell on the surfaces of things, on the skin 
  of everyday life, it is his poems about Jewish identity that he allows himself 
  a certain measure of lyrical freedom, allows himself to become a singer of songs. 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let other people come as streams <br>
    that overflow a valley <br>
    and leave dead bodies, uprooted trees and fields of sand: <br>
    we Jews are as the dew, <br>
    on every blade of grass, <br>
    trodden under foot today <br>
    and here tomorrow morning. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>And yet, in spite of this deep solidarity 
  with the Jewish past, Reznikoff never deludes himself into thinking that he 
  can overcome the essential solitude of his condition simply by affirming his 
  Jewishness. For not only has be been exiled, he has been exiled twice — as a 
  Jew, and from Judaism as well. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How difficult for me is Hebrew: <br>
    even the Hebrew for <i>mother</i>, for <i>bread</i>, for <i>sun</i> <br>
    is foreign. How far I have been exiled, Zion. <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>*<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>* 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Hebrew of your poets, Zion,<br>
    is like oil upon a burn, <br>
    cool as oil; <br>
    after work, <br>
    the smell in the street at night <br>
    of the hedge in flower. <br>
    Like Solomon, <br>
    I have married and married the speech of strangers; <br>
    none are like you, Shulamite. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>It is a precarious position, to say the 
  least. Neither fully assimilated nor fully unassimilated, Reznikoff occupies 
  the unstable middle ground between two worlds and is never able to claim either 
  one as his own. Nevertheless, and no doubt precisely because of this ambiguity, 
  it is an extremely fertile ground — leading some to consider him primarily as 
  a Jewish poet (whatever the term might mean) and others to look on him as a 
  quintessentially American poet (whatever <i>that</i> term might mean). And yet 
  it is safe to say, I think, that in the end bother statements are true — or 
  else that either one is true, which probably amounts to the same thing. Reznikoff's 
  poems are what Reznikoff is: the poems of an American Jew, or, if you will, 
  or a hyphenated American, a Jewish-American, with the two terms standing not 
  so much on equal footing as combining to form a third and wholly different term: 
  the condition of being in two places at the same time, or, quite simply, the 
  condition of being nowhere. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>We have only to go on the evidence. In the 
  two volumes of <i>Complete Poems</i> (1918-1975), recently published by Black 
  Sparrow Press, there are a surprising number of poems on Jewish themes. Poems 
  not only about Jewish immigrant life in New York, but also long narratives on 
  various episodes from ancient and modern Jewish history. A list of some of these 
  titles will give a fair idea of some of Reznikoff's concerns: 'King David,' 
  'Jeremiah in the Stocks: An Arrangement of the Prophecies,' 'The Synagogue Defeated: 
  Anno 1096,' 'Palestine under the Romans,' 'The Fifth Book of the Maccabees,' 
  "Jews in Babylonia.' In all, these poems cover more than a hundred pages of 
  the approximately 350 pages in the two volumes — or nearly a third of his total 
  output. Given the nature of the poems he is best known for — the spare city 
  lyrics, transcriptions of immediate sensual data—it is strange that he should 
  have devoted so much of his writing life to works whose inspiration comes from 
  books. Reznikoff, the lease pretentious of all poets, never shows any inclination 
  towards the scholarly acrobatics of some of his contemporaries — Pound, for 
  example, or Olson — and yet, curiously, much of his writing is a direct response 
  to, almost a translation of, his reading. By a further twist, these poems that 
  treat of apparently remote subjects are among his most personal works. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>To be schematic for a moment, a simplified 
  explanation would be as follows: America is Reznikoff's present, Judaism is 
  his past. The act of immersing himself in Jewish history is finally no different 
  from him than the act of stepping out into the streets of New York. In both 
  cases, it is an attempt to come to terms with what he is. The past, however, 
  cannot be directly perceived: it can only be experienced through books. When 
  Reznikoff writes about King David, therefore Moses, or any other Biblical figure, 
  he is in effect writing about himself. Even in his most light-hearted moments, 
  this preoccupation with his ancestors is always with him. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font><i>God and Messenger</i> </p>
  <p>The pavement barren <br>
    as the mountain <br>
    on which God spoke to Moses — <br>
    suddenly in the street <br>
    shining against my legs <br>
    the bumper of a motor car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The point is that Reznikoff the Jew and Reznikoff the American cannot be separated 
  from one another. Each aspect of his work must be read in relation to the oeuvre 
  as a whole, for in the end each point of view inhabits all the others. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The tree in the twilit street — <br>
    the pods hang from its bare symmetrical branches <br>
    motionless — <br>
    but if, like God, a century were to us <br>
    the twinkling of an eye, <br>
    we should see the frenzy of growth. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Which is to say: the eye is not adequate. 
  Not even the seen can be truly seen. The human perspective, which continually 
  thrusts us into a place where 'only the narrow present is alive,' is an exile 
  from eternity, an exclusion from the fullness of human possibility. That Reznikoff, 
  who insists so strenuously ion all his work on this human perspective, should 
  at the same time be aware of its limits, gives his work a reflexive quality, 
  an element of self-doubt that permeates even the most straightforward lyric. 
  For all his apparent simplicity, Reznikoff is by no means a primative. A reductionist, 
  perhaps, but a highly sophisticated one — who, as an adroit craftsman, always 
  manages to make us forget that each poem is the product (as he put it in one 
  work) of 'hunger, silence, and sweat.' </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>There is, however, a bridge between time 
  and eternity in Reznikoff's work, a link between God and man, in the precise 
  place where man is forced to abstain most vigorously from the demands of the 
  self: in the idea of the Law. The Law in the Jewish sense of the word and, by 
  extension, in the English sense. <i>Testimony</i> is a work in which reading 
  has become the equivalent of seeing: 'Note: All that follows is based on the 
  law reports of the several states.' What Reznikoff has observed, has brought 
  to life, is the word, the language of men. So that the act of witness has become 
  synonymous with the act of creation — and the shouldering of its burden. 'Now 
  suppose in a court of law,' Reznikoff told Dembo in their interview, 'you are 
  testifying in a negligence case. You cannot get up on the stand and say, "The 
  man was negligent." That's a conclusion of fact. What you be compelled to say 
  is how the man acted. Did he stop before he crossed the street? Did he look? 
  The judges of whether he is negligent or not are the jury in that case and the 
  judges of what you say as a poet are the readers. That is, there is an analogy 
  between testimony in the courts and the testimony of a poet.' </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Trained as a lawyer (though he never practiced) 
  and for many years a researcher for a legal encyclopedia, Reznikoff used the 
  workings of the law not only as a description of the poetic process, but also, 
  more basically, as an aesthetic ideal. In his long autobiographical poem, <i>Early 
  History of a Writer</i>, he explains how the study of law helped to discipline 
  him as a poet: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I saw that I could use the expensive machinery <br>
    that had cost me four years of hard work at law <br>
    and which I had thought useless for my writing: <br>
    prying sentences open to look at the exact meaning; <br>
    weighing words to choose only those that had <br>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>meat for my purpose <br>
    and throwing the rest away as empty shells. <br>
    I, too, could scrutinize every word and phrase <br>
    as if in a document or the opinion of a judge <br>
    and listen, as well, for tones and overtones, <br>
    leaving only the pithy, the necessary, the clear and plain. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><i><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Testimony: The United States (1885-1915) 
  Recitative</i> is perhaps Reznikoff's most important achievement as a poet. 
  A quietly astonishing work, so deceptive in its making that it would be easy 
  to misread it is a document rather than as a piece of art, it is at once a kaleidoscope 
  vision of American life and the ultimate test of Reznikoff's poetic principles. 
  Composed of small, self-contained fragments, each the distillation of an actual 
  court case, the overall effect is nevertheless extremely coherent. Reznikoff 
  has no lessons to teach, no axe to grind, no ideology to defend: he merely wants 
  to present the facts. For example: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the time of their marriage <br>
    Andrew was worth about fifty thousand dollars; <br>
    Polly had nothing. 'He was gone up to the mine, <br>
    and I wish to God he would fall down <br>
    and break his neck. <br>
    I just hate him. <br>
    I just shiver when he touches me.' </p>
  <p>'Andy, I am going to write a letter that may seem <br>
    hardhearted: <br>
    you know that I do not love you <br>
    as I should <br>
    and I know that I never can. <br>
    Don't you think it best <br>
    to give me a divorce? <br>
    If you do, <br>
    I will not have to sell the house in Denver <br>
    that you gave me, <br>
    and I will give back the ranch in Delta. <br>
    After we are divorced, <br>
    if you care for me and I care for you, <br>
    we will marry again. Polly.' <br>
  </p>

    and sat the child in some hot ashes <br>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>It would be difficult for a poet to make 
  himself more invisible than Reznikoff does in this book. To find a comparable 
  approach to the real, one would have to go back to the great prose writers at 
  the turn of the century. As in Chekov or in early Joyce, the desire to allow 
  events to speak for themselves, to choose the exact detail that will say everything 
  and thereby allow as much as possible to remain unsaid. This kind of restraint 
  paradoxically requires an openness of spirit that is available to very few: 
  an ability to accept the given, to remain a witness of human behavior and not 
  succumb to the temptation of being a judge. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>The success of <i>Testimony</i> becomes 
  all the more striking when placed beside <i>Holocaust</i>, a far less satisfying 
  work that is based on the same techniques. Using as his sources the U.S. Government 
  publication, <i>Trials of the Criminals before the Nuremberg Tribunal</i>, and 
  the records of the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, Reznikoff attempts to deal with 
  Germany's annihilation of the Jews in the same dispassionate, documentary style 
  with which he had explored the human dramas buried in American court records. 
  The problem, I think, is one of magnitude. Reznikoff is a mater of the everyday; 
  he understands the seriousness of small events and has an uncanny sympathy with 
  the lives of ordinary people. In a work such as <i>Testimony</i> he is able 
  to present us with the facts in a way that simultaneously makes us understand 
  them: the two gestures are inseparable. In the case of Holocaust, however, we 
  all know the facts in advance. The holocaust, which is precisely the unknowable, 
  the unthinkable, requires a treatment <i>beyond the facts</i> in order for us 
  to be able to understand it — assuming that such a thing is even possible. Similar 
  in approach to a 1960's play by Peter Weiss, <i>The Investigation</i>, Reznikoff's 
  poem rigorously refuses to pass judgment on any of the atrocities it describes. 
  But this is nevertheless a false objectivity, for the poem is not saying to 
  the reader, 'decide for yourself,' it is saying that the decision has already 
  been made and that the only way we can deal with these things is to remove them 
  from their inherently emotional setting. The problem is that we cannot remove 
  them. This setting is a necessary starting point. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font><i>Holocaust</i> is instructive, however, 
  in that it shows us the limits of Reznikoff's work. I do not mean shortcomings 
  — but limits, those things that set off and describe a space, that create a 
  world. Reznikoff is essentially a poet of naming. One does not have the sense 
  of a poetry immersed in language but rather of something that takes place <i>before</i> 
  language and comes to fruition at the precise moment language has been discovered 
  — and it yields a style that is pristine, fastidious, almost stiff in its effort 
  to say exactly what it means to say. If any one word can be used to describe 
  Reznikoff's work, it would be humility — towards language and also towards himself.

    with quiet. </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>It could have been an easy life for Reznikoff. 
  Throughout the many years he devoted to writing poetry (his first poems were 
  published in 1918, when he was twenty-four, and he went on publishing until 
  his death in early 1976), he suffered from a neglect so total it was almost 
  scandalous. Forced to bring out most of his books in private editions (many 
  of them printed by himself), he also had to fight the constant pressures of 
  making a living. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After I had worked all day at what I earn my living <br>
    I was tired. Now my own work has lost another day, <br>
    I thought, but began Slowly, <br>
    and slowly my strength came back to me. <br>
    Surely, the tide comes in twice a day. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>It was not until he was in his late sixties 
  that Reznikoff began to receive some measure of recognition. New Directions 
  published a book of his selected poems, <i>By The Waters of Manhattan</i>, which 
  was followed a few years later by the first volume of <i>Testimony</i>. But 
  in spite of the success of these two books — and a growing audience for his 
  work — New Directions saw fit to drop Reznikoff from its list of authors. More 
  years passed. Then, in 1974, Black Sparrow Press brought out <i>By the Well 
  of Living & Seeing: New and Selected Poems 1918-1973</i>. More importantly, 
  it committed itself to the long overdue project of putting all of Reznikoff's 
  work back into print. Under the intelligent and sensitive editing of Seamus 
  Cooney, the sequence so far includes the two volumes of <i>Collected Poems, 
  Holocaust, The Manner Music </i>(a posthumous novel), the first two volumes 
  of <i>Testimony</i>, and will go on to include more volumes of <i>Testimony</i> 
  and a book of <i>Collected Plays</i>. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>If Reznikoff lived his life in obscurity, 
  there was never the slightest trace of resentment in his work. He was too proud 
  for that, too busy with the work itself to be overly concerned with its fate 
  in the world. Even if people are slow to listen to someone who speaks quietly, 
  he knew that eventually he would be heard. </p>
