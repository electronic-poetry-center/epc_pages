<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>So proudly she came into the 
    subway car<br>
    </span></font><font size="3"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>all who were 
    not reading their newspapers saw<br>
    the head high and the slow tread—<br>
    coat wrinkled and her belongings in a paper bag,<br>
    face unwashed and the grey hair uncombed;</span></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>simple soul, who so early 
    in the morning when only the<br>
    </span><span>        </span>poorest go to work,<br>
    <span styye='font-size:11.0pt;'>stood up in the subway and outshouting the 
    noise:<br>
    </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>&quot;Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, 
    I have a baby at home who<br>
    </span><span>         </span>is sick,<br>
    and I have no money, no job;&quot;  who did not have box or cap<br>
    <span>         </span>to take coins—<br>
    <span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>only his hands,<br>
    and, seeing only faces turned away,<br>
    did not even go down the aisle as beggars do;</span></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>the fire had burnt through 
    the floor:<br>
    machines and merchandise had fallen into<br>
    the great hole, this zero that had sucked away so many years<br>
    and now, seen at last, the shop itself;<br>
    the ceiling sloped until it almost touched the floor </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
'>a strange curve<br>
    </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>in the lines and oblongs of his life;<br>
    drops were falling<br>
    from the naked beams of the floor above,<br>
    from the soaked plaster, still the ceiling;<br>
    drops of dirty water were falling<br>
    on his clothes and hat and on his hands;<br>
    the thoughts of business<br>
    gathered in his bosom like black water<br>
    </span></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>in footsteps through a swamp;<br>
    waiting for a job, she studied the dusty table at which she sat<br>
    and the floor which had been badly swept—<br>
    the office-boy had left the corners dirty;<br>
    a mouse ran in and out under the radiator<br>
    and she drew her feet away<br>
    and her skirt about her legs, but the mouse went in and out<br>
    about its business; and she sat waiting for a job<br>
    in an unfriendly world of men and mice;</span></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>walking along the drive by 
    twos and threes,<br>
    talking about jobs,<br>
    jobs they might never get and jobs they had had,<br>
    never turning to look at the trees or the river<br>
    glistening in the sunlight or the automobiles<br>
    that went swiftly past them—<br>
    in twos and threes talking about jobs;</span></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>in the drizzle<br>
    four in a row<br>
    close to the curb<br>
    that passers-by might pass,<br>
    the squads stand<br>
    waiting for soup,<br>
    a slice of bread<br>
    and shelter—<br>
    grimy clothes<br>
    their uniform;<br>
    on a stoop<br>
    stiffly across the steps<br>
    a man<br>
    who has fainted;<br>
    each in that battalion<br>
    eyes him,<br>
    but does not move from his place,<br>
    well drilled in want.</span></font></p>
