  <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>In 1974, I was invited by Anthony Rudolf 
  to contribute an article to the London Magazine, <i>European Judaism</i>, for 
  an issue celebrating Charles Reznikoff's eightieth birthday. I had been living 
  in France for the past four years, and the little piece I sent in on Reznikoff's 
  work was the first thing I wrote after coming back to America. It seemed like 
  a fitting way to mark my return.<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>I moved into an apartment on Riverside 
  Drive in late summer. After finishing the article, I discovered that Reznikoff 
  lived very near by-on West End Avenue-and sent him a copy of the manuscript, 
  along with a letter asking him if it would be possible for us to meet. Several 
  weeks went by without a response.<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>On a Sunday in early October I was to be 
  married. The ceremony was scheduled to take place in the apartment at around 
  noon. At eleven o'clock, just moments before the guests were due to arrive, 
  the telephone rang and an unfamiliar voice asked to speak to me. &quot;This 
  is Charles Reznikoff,&quot; the voice said, in a sing-song tone, looping ironically 
  and with evident good humor. I was, or course, pleased and flattered by the 
  call, but I explained that it would be impossible for me to talk just now. I 
  was about to be married, and I was in no condition to form a coherent sentence. 
  Reznikoff was highly amused by this and burst out laughing. &quot;I never called 
  a man on his wedding day before!&quot; he said. &quot;Mazel tov, mazel tov!&quot; 
  We arranged to meet the following week at his apartment. Then I hung up the 
  phone and marched off to the altar.<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Reznikoff's apartment was on the twenty-second 
  floor of a large building complex, with a broad, uncluttered view of the Hudson 
  and sunlight pouring through the windows. I arrived in the middle of the day, 
  and with a somewhat stale crumb cake set before me and numerous cups of coffee 
  to drink, I wound up staying three or four hours. The visit made such an impression 
  on me that even now, almost a decade later, it is entirely present inside me.<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>I have met some good story-tellers in my 
  life, but Reznikoff was the champion. Some of his stories that day went on for 
  thirty or forty minutes, and no matter how far he seemed to drift from the point 
  he was supposedly trying to make, he was in complete control. He had the patience 
  that is necessary to the telling of a good story-and the ability to savor the 
  least detail that cropped up along the way. What at first seemed to be an endless 
  series of digressions, a kind of aimless wandering, turned out to be the elaborate 
  and systematic construction of a circle. For example: why did you come back 
  to New York after living in Hollywood? There followed a myriad of little incidents: 
  meeting the brother of a certain man on a park bench, the color of someone's 
  eyes, an economic crisis in some country. Fifteen minutes later, convinced that 
  Reznikoff was lost, too-he would begin a slow return to his starting point. 
  Then, with great clarity and conviction, he would announce: &quot;So that's 
  why I left Hollywood.&quot; In retrospect, it all made perfect sense.<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>I heard stories about his childhood, his 
  aborted career in journalism, his law studies, his work for his parents as a 
  jobber of hats and how he would write poems on a bench at Macy's while waiting 
  his turn to show the store buyer his samples. There were also stories about 
  his walks-in particular, his journey from New York to Cape Cod (on foot!), which 
  he undertook when he was well past sixty. The important thing, he explained, 
  was not to walk too fast. Only by forcing himself to keep to a pace of less 
  than two miles per hour could he be sure to see everything he wanted to see. 
  <br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>On my visit that day, I brought along for 
  him a copy of my first book of poems, <i>Unearth</i>, which had just been published. 
  This evoked a story from Reznikoff that strikes me as significant, especially 
  in the light of the terrible neglect his work suffered for so many years. His 
  first book, he told me, had been published in 1918 by Samuel Roth (who would 
  later become famous for pirating <i>Ulysses</i> and his role in the 1933 court 
  case over Joyce's book). The leading American poet of the day was Edwin Arlington 
  Robinson, and Reznikoff had sent him a copy of the book, hoping for some sign 
  of encouragement from the great man. One afternoon Reznikoff was visiting Roth 
  in his bookstore, and Robinson walked in. Roth went over to greet him, and Reznikoff, 
  standing in the back corner of the shop, witnessed the following scene. Roth 
  proudly gestured to the copies of Reznikoff's book that were on display and 
  asked Robinson if he had read the work of this fine young poet. &quot;Yeah, 
  I read the book,&quot; said Robinson in a gruff, hostile voice, &quot;and I 
  thought it was garbage.&quot;<br>
  <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>&quot;And so,&quot; said Reznikoff to me 
  in 1974, &quot;I never got to meet Edwin Arlington Robinson.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>It was not until I was putting on my coat 
  and getting ready to leave that Reznikoff said anything about the piece I had 
  sent him. It had been composed in an extremely dense and cryptic style, wresting 
  with issues that Reznikoff himself had probably never consciously thought about, 
  and I had no idea what his reaction would be. His silence about it during our 
  long conversation led me to suspect that he had not liked it.<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>&quot;About your article,&quot; he said, 
  almost off-handedly. &quot;It reminds me of something that once happened to 
  my mother. A stranger walked up to her on the street one day and very kindly 
  and graciously complimented her on her beautiful hair. Now, you must understand 
  that my mother had never prided herself on her hair and did not consider it 
  to be one of her better features. But, on the strength of that stranger's remark, 
  she spent the rest of the day in front of her mirror, preening and primping 
  and admiring her hair. That's exactly what your article did to me. I stood in 
  front of the mirror the whole afternoon and admired myself.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Several weeks later, I received a letter 
  from Reznikoff about my book. It was filled with praise, and the numerous quotations 
  from the poems convinced me that he was earnest-that he had actually sat down 
  and read the book. Nothing could have meant more to me. <br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>A few years after Reznikoff's death, a 
  letter came to me from La Jolla, written by a friend who works in the American 
  Poetry Archive at the University of California library-where Reznikoff's papers 
  had recently been sold. In going through the material, my dear friend told me, 
  he had come across Reznikoff's copy of <i>Unearth</i>. Astonishingly, the book 
  was filled with numerous small notations in the margins, as well as stress marks 
  that Reznikoff had made throughout the poems in an effort to scan them correctly 
  and understand their rhythms. Helpless to do or say anything, I thanked him 
  from the other side of the grave.<br>
</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Wherever Edwin Arlington Robinson might 
  be now, one can be sure that his accommodations aren't half as good as Charles 
  Reznikoff's.</p>
