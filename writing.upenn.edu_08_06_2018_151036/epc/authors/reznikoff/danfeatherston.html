<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Charles Reznikoff's <i>Holocaust</i> is one 
of the few poems on the Holocaust that calls Adorno's famous quotation into doubt. 
This book is composed solely of Holocaust survivor testimony distilled from twenty-six 
volumes of documentation of the Eichmann and Nuremberg trials. Using transcriptions 
from the court proceedings, the entire poem is devoid of metaphorical language 
and the rhetorical framework of interpretation. As in court testimony, there are 
no conclusions, no judgments that would preclude the hearing: 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Among those who had hidden themselves<br>
    were four women and a little girl of about seven<br>
    hiding in a pit-a dugout covered with leaves;<br>
    and two S.S. men went up to the pit and ordered them to<br>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>come out.<br>
    &quot;Why did you hide?&quot; they asked<br>
    and began to beat the women with whips.<br>
    The women begged for their lives:<br>
    they were young, they were ready to work.<br>
    They were ordered to rise and run <br>
    and the S.S. men drew their revolvers and shot all five;<br>
    and then kept pushing the bodies with their feet<br>
    to see if they were still alive<br>
    and to make sure they were dead<br>
    shot them again. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>The absence of legal and literary rhetoric, 
  as well as authorial interpretation, removes any buffer zone between the testimony 
  and the reader. There is no exterior to <i>Holocaust</i> except the reader. 
  In regard to the Adorno quote, it is interesting to note that Reznikoff's near-invisibility 
  in the poem has led several critics to dismiss the work as &quot;not poetry.&quot; 
  In a review of <i>Holocaust</i>, Robert Alter opines that there is a &quot;numbing 
  pointlessness in the constant repetition of savagery and murder without the 
  slightest interpretive response on the part of the poet...&quot; <a href="1.html">(1)</a> 
  And yet, &quot;numbing pointlessness&quot; seems to refer to the Holocaust itself 
  rather than the poem, foregrounding the reader's witnessing of testimony, not 
  the poet's interpretation of it. In the court of poetry, Alter places the poet 
  in the position of judge, while his own criticism of <i>Holocaust</i> is itself 
  a judgment: not merely of the poem, but of the silence that follows each testimony. 
  This silence is the historical permanence of these experiences without the distancing 
  of authorial interpretation and historical/official judgment. This desire for 
  language to provide a kind of telos, a closure to the &quot;numbing&quot; repetition 
  of historical brutality, bears an eerie resemblance to the SS <i>Figuren</i>: 
  that is, the desire for language to resolve or redeem history. <a href="2.html">(2)</a> 
  Poetry, however overtly judgmental and symbolic its language, cannot erase history 
  any more than incineration and brutal language-games erase the dead. Reznikoff's 
  <i>Holocaust</i> allows for the testimony to exist as an event in itself whereby 
  the poet's role is not to speak over the testimony, but to listen.</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF">blank </font>Since the process of selection and combination 
  are interpretive acts, no text is devoid of interpretation. If we expand the 
  definition of interpretation to include form, Reznikoff interprets by installing 
  line-breaks, as well as by numbering and grouping testimonies into subheadings 
  (&quot;Deportation,&quot; &quot;Invasion,&quot; &quot;Research,&quot; etc.). 
  Thus, the poem is arranged thematically as opposed to chronologically, departing 
  from the sequence of the court proceedings just as the proceedings depart from 
  the chronology of the Holocaust itself. Another interpretive aspect of <i>Holocaust</i> 
  is the text's metonymic relationship to the actual Holocaust. As the proceedings 
  did not circumscribe the Holocaust, Reznikoff's poem does not circumscribe the 
  documentation of the proceedings. Instead, <i>Holocaust</i> draws from a massive 
  compilation of first-person testimony excluded from the generic timelines of 
  &quot;History.&quot; The Poet's testimonial fragments develop an accumulative 
  and specific, as opposed to summational and general, approach to history. <a href="3.html">(3)</a></p>
<p>While the atrocities committed by the Third Reich were carried out on a massive 
  scale, the Holocaust is ultimately each act of brutality by each individual 
  acting under one government. And it is the primacy of these specific acts and 
  their impact on individuals that <i>Holocaust</i> recovers from historical summation 
  and the numbing of statistics:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Once the commander of a camp had eight of the strongest among<br>
    the Jews<br>
    placed in a large barrel of water,<br>
    saying that they did not look clean,<br>
    and they had to stand in this barrel naked for twenty-four hours.<br>
    In the morning, other Jews had to cut away the ice:<br>
    the men were frozen to death.<br>
    In this camp-and in others also-<br>
    they had an orchestra of Jews<br>
    who had to play every morning and evening<br>
    and whenever Jews were taken to be shot.<br>
    In one such camp,<br>
    the orchestra had all of sixty men. [74]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than twenty years after his death, Reznikoff's poetry continues to be 
  dismissed by poets outside the mainstream as &quot;prose narrative&quot; and 
  by the mainstream as nonexistent. Few readers of poetry have ever heard of Reznikoff, 
  despite that his poetry is perhaps the most direct and available of all the 
  American modernists. Reznikoff's poetry incorporated social, historical, and 
  ethical dimensions into one of objectivism's high-profile precursors, imagism, 
  and developed the traditions of the prose-,<br>
  found-, docu-, and epic poem, as well as the cross-semination of literary and 
  legal genres.</p>
