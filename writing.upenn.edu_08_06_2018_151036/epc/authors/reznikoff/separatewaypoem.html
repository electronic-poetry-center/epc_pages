  <div align="left">
    <p><font size="3">Take no stock in the friendly words of friends,<br>
      for in such kindness all their kindness ends;<br>
      we go our separate ways to death.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The love of father or of mother knows<br>
      the fear of sickness, the need of food and clothes,<br>
      but otherwise--we go our separate ways to death.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Kiss after kiss of the head beside you on the cushion,<br>
      but faithful only in its fashion--<br>
      we go our separate ways to death.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If you would see the phoenix burn<br>
      and in the traffic hunt a unicorn,<br>
      well, ride the subway till your death<br>
      and hold your job till you are out of breath.<br>
      We heard your jokes, your storiues, and your songs,<br>
      know all of your rights and all your wrongs,<br>
      but we are busy with our own affairs.</font><font size="3">Sorry? O yes! 
      But after all who cares?<br>
      You think that you have something still to say?<br>
      Perhaps. But you are growing old, are growing grey.<br>
      And we are too.<br>
      We'll spare another friendly word for you;<br>
      and go our separate ways to death.</font></p>
