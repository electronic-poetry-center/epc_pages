<p>(3) Janet Sutherland's essay &quot;Reznikoff and his Sources&quot; (<i>Man 
  and Poet,</i> pp. 297-307) is an insightful examination of Reznikoff's use of 
  primary sources. Charles Bernstein's &quot;Reznikoff's Nearness&quot; (<i>Sulfur</i> 
  32, Spring 1993, pp. 6-38; focusing on Reznikoff's &quot;Testimony&quot;) provides 
  a way of looking at the poet's work as cubo-serialism: &quot;[T]he permutation 
  of briefly etched, identifiable details that don't quite stand on their own 
  and that are separated by a gap, or interval, that requires a full stop. The 
  prefix suggests rhetorically consonant permutations of angles of view on related 
  (or linked) subjects.&quot; Both essays signal a shift, perhaps, in the critical 
  studies of Reznikoff's poetics toward an interest in his radical use of forms 
  under the veneer of &quot;easy, narrative&quot; content. </p>
