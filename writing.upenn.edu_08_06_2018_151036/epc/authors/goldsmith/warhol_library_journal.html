This collection pulls together 37 interviews that Andy Warhol gave throughout his life, from 1962 to 1987. Derived from publications ranging from underground art magazines to major magazines like Vogue, the conversations present a different trait in Warhol's unique persona. Readers are left knowing both more and less about one of the most compelling artists of 20th-century America. We know more because we are given a thoroughly illuminating glimpse into his personality, but we know less because we still wonder about the ideas that he never discussed. However, not knowing what Warhol omits is part and parcel of his dualistic role as both a highly accessible and an enigmatic artist. Even 17 years after his death, Warhol probably wouldn't want to be represented any other way. A fascinating collection difficult to put down, this is highly recommended for public and academic libraries.
