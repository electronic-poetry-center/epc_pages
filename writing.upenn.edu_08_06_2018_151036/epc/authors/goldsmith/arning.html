<P>
&quot;If every word spoken in New York City daily were somehow
to materialize as a snowflake, each day there would be a blizzard,&quot;
read the invitation card to Kenneth Goldsmith's Soliloquy exhibition
at New York's Bravin Post Lee Gallery. While the phrase may be
a tad too self-consciously Yoko Ono-like it does succinctly locate
many different aspects of Goldsmith's practice. The artist has
consistently attempted to measure the relative weight or lack
thereof that words possess, and how they are woven throughout
the fabric of lived life, and the practice has led Goldsmith,
who was trained as a sculptor, into a hybridized world in which
he is just as often the visiting guest speaker in university poetry
and literature departments as in their art schools. He often collaborates
with renowned figures in the world of contemporary avant-guard
music. Even Goldsmith's weekly radio show on uber-cool New York
Station WFMU, the appropriately titled Unpopular Music, is linked
to his undelimited art practice. Today artists routinely within
the gallery/museum context design furniture, cook, make movies
and records or animate cartoons but often do so only in the art
world out of habit. Goldsmith's fluid yet considered movements
between adjacent spheres of culture is a fascinating case study.
<BR>

<P>
His earliest mature works were sculptures of books. Some were
pun-like, as with a ten-foot tall self-evidently unpilferable
replica of Abbie Hoffman's yippie classic <I>Steal This Book!</I>
He began turning towards card catalogs as a source and in one
instance made a funeral sculpture with six books from the New
York Public Library card catalog that started with the phrase
&quot;Death of a....(Death of a Perfect Mother, Death of a Simple
Giant, Death of a Minor Character). The simulated books were black
and laid out like a row of tombstones. Then in the late 80s he
turned his attention to a rarely considered, unloved by anyone
tome, <I>The Rhyming Dictionary</I>, which in its systematized,
non meaning-based attention to words gave Goldsmith a method to
denaturalize his own use of language.<BR>

<P>
Rhyme, the agent of generations of moon, June, spoon romanticism,
had all but disappeared from contemporary high arts except in
the form of appropriated snippets meant to remind the viewer or
listener of less sophisticated time. But of course pop songs and
most insistently rap music were strongly rhyme driven. It was
at this point that Goldsmith's practice left the traditional sphere
of sculpture and moved toward a hybrid literary/visual/performance
arts practice in which pieces were translated between book, gallery
installation and theatrical form. He began to jot down phrases
that somehow crossed over in his consciousness from back ground
hum to be memorable enough for Goldsmith's notepad. They were
then organized, as in <I>The Rhyming Dictionary</I> firstly, according
to the sound of the last syllable, and secondly in the order of
the number of syllables in the word or phrase. One such drawing
might start with &quot;beau. Blow, bo, Bo, bow, bro&quot;, winding
through longer sound bites, such as &quot;Adrian Barbeau, accelerando,
Andres Serrano&quot; and ends with &quot;You don't need a weather
man to know which way the wind blows. &quot;<BR>

<P>
The magnum opus of the rhyming works, No. 111 2.7.93 - 10.20.96
was in book form, its title describing the dates of his collecting
activities. It begins with one syllable sounds &quot;A,a, ear,
acts, aer...&quot; and ends with a 7, 228 syllable appropriation,
a complete short story by DH Lawrence. Goldsmith's first participations
in poetry readings were often hysterical to witness. As each piece
of the period begins with one syllable words Goldsmith would always
sound at the start as if he were honking like a goose, which was
surprisingly refreshing after having sat through romantic poems
by more traditional practitioners about drive-ins and lost loves.
Then as he climbed his syllabic ladder the words became, even
in their chance arrangements quite haunting and resonant.<BR>

<P>
While Goldsmith's self-imposed systems mangled context and phrases
that would have seemed familiar became abstract, almost nonsensical,
still they could be read like a diary, a history of listening
intently to words that otherwise would have passed quickly into
the ether. Goldsmith refers to speech as &quot;the second most
ephemeral human product, the first being thought&quot; and his
practice is a way of considering this invisible mass that always
floats around us by materializing and concretizing it. For a show
at the Artist's Museum in Lodz, Poland he made a poem in Polish,
a language he doesn't speak, just by recognizing similar patterns
of letters and checking with Poles to make sure they actually
rhymed. As he was drawing his phrases from Polish rock and porn
mags he was given by his local university student assistants,
the Poles were cracking up at ludicrously funny juxtapositions
that Goldsmith could not have a known were there. That fact pleased
this resolute Cageian belief in the incomparable value of chance
occurrences.<BR>

<P>
To create Soliloquy he tape-recorded continuously everything for
a period of one week. He then laboriously transcribed only those
words that had issued from his mouth. As the host of a radio show
Goldsmith often did speak in soliloquy form but the piece of writing
also includes dinner party chatter, gossip, commands and endearances
directed toward his dog, Babette, and intimate conversations with
his wife, the artist Cheryl Donegan. Although one is aware of
being taped at first, no one can maintain the mental self censorship
for that long a period and Goldsmith did not edit out those things
that he knew would cost him both personal and professional relationships.
<BR>

<P>
The exhibition form of Soliloquy was a wallpaper that covered
every surface of the gallery space. It could theoretically be
read beginning to end, but the specifics of the gallery space
made both the top panels and lower extremities trying to read,
so visitors meandered through looking for juicy bits. Again the
lack of context, not knowing what the other person said to provoke
Goldsmith's response, made the common words strangely indecipherable.
One was left with a startling new awareness of the sheer quantity
of effluvia that each and every one of us expel every week. While
Goldsmith had been moving further away from the normal art world
distribution systems, pieces such a Soliloquy made clear that
there were certain things he wanted to accomplish with his writing
that could only occur in the gallery/museum system. In this case
the spatialization of words, replacing the temporal coordinate
system onto which language usually fall with an architectural
lattice, called us to consciousness of the mass of evanescent
verbiage in a way the same words in book form could not. Goldsmith
has said that process forever changed his relationship to his
own speech and that of others, stating &quot;I could not longer
find a way back to seeing speech as transparent. &quot;<BR>

<P>
When working as a librettist with new music legends Joan La Barbara
and Theo Bleckmann he has not allowed himself to be a full collaborator,
but rather only given them text to interpret as they will. Bleckmann
recently turned Goldsmith's newest text work, <I>Fidget</I>, into
a multimedia performance staged at the Whitney Museum at Philip
Morris. In <I>Fidget</I>, Goldsmith's most narrative work, he
spoke aloud and taped every minute action, motions, micromotion
and sensation of body processes he could articulate, every moment
of the day, from waking to sleeping. His day begins &quot;Eyelids
open. Tongue runs across upper lip moving from left side of mouth
to right following arc of lip. Swallow. Jaws clench. Grind. Stretch.
Swallow. Head lifts. Bent right arm brushes pillow into back of
head.&quot; While the function of language in making life experience
cohere enough to be recorded in memory has been much commented
on, Goldsmith, by extending this to the point of absurdity, gives
us a terrifying take on what it feels like to reside in a sensate
body. If we could not ignore most of our motions and processes
we would quickly go insane, as Goldsmith does. He tries to masturbate
to calm himself, but maintaining the constraints of describing
every motion leaves no mental space for sexual fantasy, causing
what he latter described as in intense body-only sensation far
removed from traditional onanistic reverie.<BR>

<P>
Finally he drinks an entire bottle of whiskey to pass out, the
only way to legally end the piece within his self imposed rules.
Of course, before nodding off his mumbles became increasingly
unintelligible, and are transcribed as such. The last hour which
was an inebriated blur is the first hour written backwards....
&quot;xaler swaJ .wollawS .pil fo cra gniwollof tfel ot htuom
fo edis thgir morf gnivom pil reppu ssorca snur eugnoT Eyelids
close&quot;. It was planned that Goldsmith's over-described day
and the performance version both occurred on June 16th one year
apart because it is Bloomsday, the day described in James Joyce's
<I>Ulysses</I>.<BR>

<P>
Bleckmann sang the first chapter of Goldsmith's <I>Fidget</I>,
describing his first hour after waking from a balcony above the
stage with each description on a separate sheet. As each was sung
it was dropped to seamstresses waiting at sewing machines. They
then joined them into a man's suit into which Bleckmann changed
at the end of the hour, literally inhabiting the described actions.
To hear the expulsion of morning mucus from the nostrils ethereally
sung by Bleckmann was as startlingly incongruous as to read such
an unsensational act described by Goldsmith as if it were a recipe
for a difficult but exquisite souffl&eacute;.<BR>

<P>
<I>Fidget</I> also exists as an installation of 12 suits sewn,
one from each of the hours Goldsmith described, and it will soon
be available in book form as well. Perhaps the most interesting
form is the Java applet Goldsmith created with programmer Clem
Paulsen on view at http://www/stadiumweb.com/fidget. On seeing
Goldsmith progress through his day, the words float, hover and
fade. It is as if we were hovering in his word-besotted head.
When the whiskey kicks in the words throb, and when the day ends
we move slowly towards darkness.<BR>

<P>
Goldsmith knows that when we see a sizable block of text in a
gallery we expect to either be hectored about topical matters
or to be made to feel inadequate for not fully comprehending the
artist's witty retort to Lacan. But in such visual arts use of
text, the artists are using language in it more traditional role,
to speak &quot;of things&quot;, to report on the prevailing conditions
either of the outside world or of our interior thought patterns.
Goldsmith has realized that the language is the constant companion
through life, concomitant with it. He goes beyond a simple equation
of language = life since that still implies two equal things,
but beyond that to language and life are the same thing, inseparable,
impossible to consider independently. To wake, work, and rest
within a verbal cloud is a specific component of being embodied
in sentient vessels, and therefore irresistible and should be
cherished. Goldsmith attempts to look at language as the part
of life it is, and in through revealing it processes in his daily
life to consider it's functions for all of us.<BR>
