<br><br> If you are a graduate student studying 
Wittgenstein or a fan of Marjorie
Perloff (whose essay on differential poetics in Goldsmith and Kinsella
appears in part here), dust off your whistles and bells; this one's for you.
Poet, artist, alternative radio DJ, and cool-man-about-town Goldsmith was
commissioned by the Whitney to spend Bloomsday, 1997, speaking his body's
every movement into a dictaphone, which recording was transcribed and
presented variously as a multi-media installation, a java applet, and this
book-length poem. Half-performance art, half-semiotic game, Fidget lives
equally under the sign of Leopold Bloom's ode to mechanical reproduction
("have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house") and that of
alien sociologist Mork's habit of translating his facial expressions into
words. Goldsmith very effectively makes it strange: Fidget reads at first
like an exercise in decoding oblique strings of words into a coherent
narrative: "Right hand moves palm upward. Back of hand holds as thumb and
forefingers grab." The near-impossibility of doing so is reflected by
Goldsmith's own growing frustration with the strictures of his task; by hour
five, clinical descriptions become subtly contaminated with interpretation:
"Dots appear blue." This linguistic bursting-at-the-seams, for which
Goldsmith attempts an antidote in hour eight's single verb sentences,
precedes a complete breakdown (fueled only partly by alcohol), as the rigid
protocols of a project trying its darnedest towards objectivity (no personal
pronouns, no human contact, tape recorder) are defeated by body, mind, and
language, each remarkably resistant to containment. True to its title,
Fidget encourages a restless perusal of its multi-media incarnations; but,
while both the operatics of the song-and-dance version and the simultaneity
enabled by hypertext more effectively mirror bodily excess, the print
version best reconstructs the constricted narrative space of the original
exercise, and gives us the unmitigated beauty of the exuberant-and defiantly
individual-body and mind overflowing such narrow confines.
