Werner Herzog, the stoic devil that best managed to capture avenging angel
Klaus Kinski on film deep in the wilds of the Amazon, once said that a film
director is more an athlete than an aesthete -- that stamina is as important
as sensibility. Kenneth Goldsmith has made a career out of creating, through
masochistically tortuous writing practices, impossibly long, but very simply
conceived books that follow through to the bitter end on some writing
tick -- either through collecting, for two years, all of the phrases he
encountered ending in the sound "r" (<i>No. 111</i>) or by spending an entire
Bloomsday recording his every body movement into a tape recorder and
transcribing it (<i>Fidget</i>).  Book writing is a second career for Goldsmith, as
he was a successful RISD-educated gallery sculpture for several years.  He probably as well known now as the creator and
maintainer of the ubu.com website (a huge collection of concrete poetry and
sound files), as a provocative, frequently banned disk jockey on New Jersey's WFMU, and as a regular reviewer of avant-garde music for the 
<i>New York
Press</i>.  Goldsmith's new book, <i>Day</i>, doesn't reneg on this promise for
extremity -- extremely simple acts repeated to the point of complex
insights -- as it is a complete resetting of one day's New York Times, read
linearly across the page (like a scanner), into plain text without missing a
sales pitch, a day's errata note, obituary or punctuation mark.  This huge
blue tome makes his 610-page <i>No. 111</i> look like an issue of <i>Reader's Digest</i>
(indeed, any book less completist feels so), creating, of course, a lively
air of scepticism (the meat of his art) in the mind of anyone who might
chance to "read" it. Of course we must be sceptical -- of course we must be
human -- as one was sceptical when Howard Johnsons first started appearing
across the American desert and Warhol siphoned millions into his checking
account without lifting a brush.  But, in fact, Goldmsith is on to something
deeper than mere pop bravado, as <i>Day</i> shows that a reader's interests are fed
by only a fraction of the available information out there, but one needs
this exclusivity, this personal-editing, to gird identity.  For a tennis
fan, there is a unique pleasure in reading about Andre Agassi's 3rd round
loss to Arnauld Clement in the 2000 French Open, just riding the wave of his
big comeback, showing he's human and also not yet married to Steffi Graf (a
little beyond human) -- that this day occurred before 9/11 adds to the
pathos. There's also an obscene -- as in "offstange" -- generosity in this
book that treats everybone from the Wall Street brokers (represented by the
largest number of pages, pure numbers and business names) to children (in
the ads for children's clothes) to, of course, those folks populating the
news and entertainment stories (it was a Friday) as equals before the blind
deity of digital typesetting and book binding -- an interesting gloss on how
history tends to reserve its annals only for the exceptional few (and how it
might not have to any longer). <i>Day</i> makes for a giddy anthropology, and if
one is to grant that it's "poetry," it is the grinning slacker brother to
the Chaucer's cross-class ventriloquy in The Canterbury Tales, but one that,
in essence, arrives hot off the press every day.  It would take weeks to
even run your eye over this stuff (one generally spends less time "reading
the paper"), and the book gives you a sublime sense of how many words are
published daily on this planet.  Flattening out a pyramid of textual
society -- its politics, its banalities, its heroicism -- into a 4th-person
narrative like this -- making a newspaper weigh over 5 pounds while in the
process engaging in a full frontal act of acidic plagiarism -- is itself a
sculptural gesture, but also philosphical one that teases the well-worn
point that the value of a text is often in how it's read than in the words,
the sportsman Agassi as unwitting Chaplin-man mascot for this postmodern
truism.
