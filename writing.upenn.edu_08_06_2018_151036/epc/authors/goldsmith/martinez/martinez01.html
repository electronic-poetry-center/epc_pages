Shakespeare know that Hamlet&#8217;s melancholy musings would come to have so
much meaning in the modern world. Or do they? What importance can we put on
something that has little more physical substance than a fragile page and a
splash of ink? What makes <i>Hamlet</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> so great? In substance it is merely a thin folio of
typeset, its author only an English gentleman. Shakespeare was assuredly a
great guy, smart, witty, and a favorite of the ladies, but these things do not
a writer make. Only words can make an author. Without Shakespeare the English
language would be poor indeed since the Bard is credited with thousands of new
additions, many of which he created for the sole purpose of perpetuating his
rhyme scheme. It is this flippant handling of pen and paper that puts
Shakespeare at the top of his field, for words are the medium of every writer,
be they traditional or avant-garde. Words are the material, the challenge and
sometimes the bane of writerly existence. The ability to take language and
actively control it requires a certain amount of skill. To drive the words past
traditional boundaries and into new literary territory takes a touch of
insanity. When it comes to words, Kenneth Goldsmith displays both talent and
madness in amazing proportion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span

novel/poem/encyclopedia <i>No.111 2.7.93-10.20.96</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> displays at least the amazing proportion
if not the talent and madness as well. <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> consists of phrases collected and
compiled between February 7, 1993 and October 20, 1996. The book is what many
would consider &#8220;unreadable,&#8221; a hyper-syllabic jumble of unfinished
sentences, inside jokes, and everyday nonsense. All phrases in <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> end with some form of the <i>schwa</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> sound, [ah, ar, etc.]. With <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, Goldsmith plays the part of
&#8220;avant-humanist,&#8221; a rare breed of experimental writer who
unwittingly stumbles into projects that capture the ever-elusive human
condition. Compiling quotes in a gleeful attempt to create a work based on
nothing, Goldsmith spent three years of his life editing a six hundred page
dissertation on the human phenomenon. <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> displays with an edge of malice,
a cynical humor, and a boundless joy the beauty and unpredictability of the
English language. The words of <i>No.111</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> do not belong to Goldsmith, for he is merely a collector,
in reality they belong to the reader, the man next door, to everyone. Through
the words we rediscover elements of ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>From street signs and websites,
strip clubs and classics Goldsmith gathered the language around him. Intently
listening to the stirring undercurrents of life on the streets of New York
City, he forged into uncharted territory determined to record language as it
happened. What he ended up with is a work of poetic non-fiction based on the
mainstream of American culture in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, a testimony to
the blizzard of words that threatens to engulf our lives. Goldsmith condensed
into one volume a &#8220;great collection of ephemera,&#8221; a seemingly
paradoxical example of the history of &#8220;today&#8221; as it is being lived.
His work reflects a complete immersion into the grit and grime of life, a foray
into the endless depths of the mind, and the inner jungle of thought. <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> documents Goldsmith&#8217;s
&#8220;Conrad-esque&#8221; journey in striking detail, revealing the vibrant,
primal, and sometimes darkly twisted nature of language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Born in 1961, Kenneth Goldsmith
grew up in an upper-middle class suburb of Long Island&#8212;hardly the setting
to spawn careers in sculpture and experimental writing. In a haze of drug use
and perpetual art class, Goldsmith graduated from Port Washington&#8217;s Paul
D. Schreiber High School in 1979, set free to explore the world at the dawning
of the &#8220;Computer Age.&#8221; It took five years and three schools for
Goldsmith to earn a degree. He moved from New York University to Parsons School
of Design in 1980, leaving New York altogether a year later for the Rhode
Island School of Design.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Goldsmith
entered the Ceramics department at RISD, following a favorite teacher who also
transferred from Parsons, but soon decided &#8220;using one material (clay) was
too limiting.&#8221;<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="martinez01.html#_edn2" name="_ednref2"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a> When he
started fabricating his work from other sources he was promptly booted from the
Ceramics department straight into Sculpture, and a fervent attachment was
formed. Goldsmith&#8217;s passion for &#8220;piles&#8221; developed during his
time at RISD, he took to randomly stacking together hundreds of cast objects,
each installation of the same objects being extremely different from the last.
The affinity for large amounts of random material piled on top of each other
stuck with Goldsmith, carrying over into his later works and into his writing.
As an artist Goldsmith was concerned with the perception of information in
space, and with aleatoric sculpture he found that he could make the
&#8220;philosophical qualities of the work [mesh] with the physical
presentation.&#8221;<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3' href="martinez01.html#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a> This
sentiment would prove extremely important in Goldsmith&#8217;s later
experiments with writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Completing
his BFA in Sculpture in 1984, Goldsmith once again found himself adrift in the
world with a diploma, but still no clue as to the direction his life, job, or
art would take. His list of jobs reads like one of his works, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>During the early days of his
sculptural career, Goldsmith pursued the same experimental designs he had in
college, which soon proved to be too time consuming and ineffective. He sought
a way to &#8220;distill the energy of the piles,&#8221; while at the same time
creating more marketable works.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="martinez01.html#_edn5"
name="_ednref5" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Under the guidance of Bill Arning, curator of the White Columns gallery,
Goldsmith produced his first stack of wooden books. The books would prove to be
the jumping-off point for the artist&#8217;s success in the gallery system. He
began to carve individual books, realizing that the single form could harness
all the kinetic energy of the pile. Goldsmith&#8217;s books created quite an
explosion in the gallery scene; suddenly he was in the spotlight as an
up-and-coming artist. In 1989, Goldsmith got his &#8220;break,&#8221; a showing
of his &#8220;Anxiety&#8221; series at White Columns. The visible force of the
books was astonishing, as the elegantly carved pages and provocative titles had
a seemingly mesmerizing effect on collectors and critics alike.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why books? In terms of shapeliness
they are fairly forgettable, being squat and rectangular. Compared to other
sculpture-worthy forms like the human body, book forms have very little
variation among the types. So, why did Goldsmith get a break with books? Anyone
who has ever been inside a library knows the feeling of wandering the stacks
looking at all the spines facing out from the shelves. Millions and millions of
pages of information, just waiting to be discovered, are hidden from view
between hardbound covers. Through his sculptures, Goldsmith tapped that
intrigue, and library-lovers disguised as gallery-goers bought it, hook, line,
and sinker. Interestingly enough, collectors were buying only a representation,
for books have a funny way of existing on two planes at once. Each carved book
was titled; giving it a theme and a subject, but content was non-existent. The
real beauty of a book is not the shape it takes at the binders; the real
attraction lies in the story it tells, whatever that may be. It would be some
years and several exhibits later, before Goldsmith realized that his job
description was changing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Whether he knew it or not Kenneth
Goldsmith was always a writer. He exhibited the &#8220;symptoms&#8221; from the
earliest stages of his documented artistic career; all of his truly memorable
works contain some form of text. While at the height of his sculptural maturity
Goldsmith was producing books, large carved volumes with intriguing and
perplexing subjects. &#8220;Expectancy&#8221; eerily projects the length of
Goldsmith&#8217;s life--1962-2028-- though his days in the art world did not
last quite so long. He created two volumes dedicated to Abbie Hoffman&#8217;s <i>Steal
This Book</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, both
aptly titled &#8220;Steal This Book,&#8221; and neither of which could be
stolen because of their abnormally large size. Political, pop culture and
literary icons like Abbie Hoffman, Bob Dylan, James Joyce, and John Cage
influenced Goldsmith&#8217;s early artwork.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When Goldsmith stumbled upon an
old copy of Random House&#8217;s <i>Rhyming Dictionary</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> he began a series of works using
the basic premise of rhymed final syllables. The first piece was entitled
&#8220;Influence of Anxiety,&#8221; based on literary theorist Harold
Bloom&#8217;s book called <i>The Anxiety of Influence. </i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Carved down the center of the book
are words ending in <i>&#8211;ence</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>; impotence, innocence, etc. Bloom&#8217;s book is an
analysis of Romantic era poetry through the lens of social, religious and
political influence. In the introduction, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde,
&#8220;Influence is simply a transference of personality, a mode of giving away
what is most precious to one&#8217;s self, and its exercise produces a sense,
and it may be, a reality of loss.&#8221;<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn6'
href="martinez01.html#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></span></a>
This statement rings true in Goldsmith&#8217;s career as well; he molded his
sculpture to the words of other writers, testing the waters before taking the
leap. His artistic influence came from works of literature, and with each work
Goldsmith set down the words that influenced him most. As Wilde points out,
Goldsmith lost another part of himself with each creation, he stagnated groups
of ideas by putting them into three-dimensional works, and it killed him.
&#8220;Influence of Anxiety&#8221; looms as an eerie foreshadowing of
Goldsmith&#8217;s complete break with the gallery circuit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Goldsmith created extraordinary
works of art, but they were frustrating to the man struggling to find his own
mode of expression. They simply took too long to make, and the words were
coming faster than the books could be carved. His pieces began to reflect his
irritation with the artistic process, and with the commercial value that the
gallery community placed on tediously &#8220;crafted&#8221; works. The longer a
work took to complete, the better the buyers liked it, a strange kind of
conceit that kept Goldsmith from increasing the volume of his work. He was
slowly drowning in the artistic shallows. An intricately carved book with a
bright light shining through the word &#8220;Truth,&#8221; was beautiful to
look at indeed, though nothing but air lay between its hollow pages. In short
&#8220;The Blinding Truth&#8221; was a signal for Goldsmith to drop everything
and take a hard look at the real content of his work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Inspired
by Joseph Kosuth&#8217;s &#8220;dictionary&#8221; pieces, Goldsmith abandoned
carved books in favor of paper and canvas. Kosuth observed the disparity of
using words to describe and define other words. In his &#8220;Art as Idea as
Idea&#8221; series Kosuth lifted the definition of &#8220;art&#8221; from the
dictionary and printed it in white ink on black paper.<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn7' href="martinez01.html#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></span></a>
(Figure 1.) By inversing the color scheme he illuminates the structure of the
definition, while at the same time turning the entry into the very thing it
defines. &#8220;Art as Idea as Idea&#8221; also shows the beauty of arranged
words, uncovering the intricate patterns of a dictionary entry where once only
reference stood. Goldsmith tried his hand at two-dimensional work, by exactly
recreating Kosuth&#8217;s dictionary layout, but using entries from the rhyming
dictionary. To Kosuth, language functions as both &#8220;formless&#8221; and
&#8220;colorless,&#8221; two extremely important factors in the creation of his
later installations.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn8' href="martinez01.html#_edn8" name="_ednref8"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></span></a> Words are
contrary to art, because they cannot be interpreted in a purely visual context,
but must resonate within both the environment and the viewer in order to obtain
meaning. One of Kosuth&#8217;s first text pieces were three glass boxes filled
with crushed, ground and stacked glass, each was labeled &#8220;Glass.&#8221;
By giving each unique cube the same abstraction, the artist removes
&#8220;concrete formal properties&#8221; leaving only the &#8220;device.&#8221;<a

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Examining
Kosuth is an excellent way to understand the content and context of
Goldsmith&#8217;s work prior to writing <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>. Goldsmith says,
&#8220;Kosuth&#8217;s definition pieces were very important to me in order to

Determining this vocabulary was an important part in Goldsmith&#8217;s coming
to age as an author. He needed a way to distance himself from the concrete
visual reality of the gallery circuit while at the same time exploring the
function of language as poetry and art. Goldsmith broke from the
three-dimensional completely with his following projects, taking Kosuth&#8217;s
lead. Using words to structure and define his artistic endeavors, Goldsmith
sought an art form somewhere between sculpture and poetry. Kosuth used panels
of clear glass leaning against the wall in his work to &#8220;avoid
composition:&#8221; works that were &#8220;not sculpture (on the floor) nor a
painting (on the wall.)&#8221;<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn11' href="martinez01.html#_edn11"
name="_ednref11" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[11]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Goldsmith took this idea and ran with it, his future projects consisting of
large panels of framed text leaning against gallery walls, nicely skewing the
line between writing and art. However, Goldsmith made a pit stop, of sorts, on
the road to revelation in the form of a pencil series titled <i>73 Poems. </i></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Goldsmith collaborated with singer
Joan La Barbara on <i>73 Poems</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>. Named for an e.e. cummings book of poems, the work
actually contains seventy-nine panels of shaded text. Words in charcoal and
graphite fill large sheets of parchment-colored rag paper. Each panel has two
different rhyme schemes, one drawn in light gray graphite, the other
overwriting it in thick, dark charcoal producing the mesmerizing special effect
of words floating on top of one another. The poems are written in such a way
that the darker text of the first becomes the lighter background text for the
next and so on, until the series wraps up with the initial background becoming
the foreground of the last sheet.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn12' href="martinez01.html#_edn12"

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the pieces; the barely visible
past lingers in the background yielding power to the brighter future, though
still resonating through the space. When hanging, the large, framed pieces
command the eye, drawing the viewer into the hazy depths of the charcoal
drawings. The poems are striking enough to stand alone, however the circularity
of the pieces draws them all together into an elaborate whole. The circular
nature of the poems is on par with the idea of a printed book being a cohesive
unit, though in exaggerated terms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When La Barbara decided to record
the poems the images were printed as a compliment/supplement to the CD version.
Seen as printed text, the subtle variations in texture and shading vanish
creating seventy-nine uniform pieces. The words of the poems come more sharply
into focus and the viewer of a lovely piece of art suddenly becomes a reader as
well. Goldsmith put another notch in his writer&#8217;s belt with the printing
of <i>73 Poems</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>,
proving that poetry does not have to make sense to be beautiful, nor does it
have to come bound in a Bible-paper anthology to be readable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By the time he released <i>73
Poems</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> Goldsmith
had started on a collection of short poems that he tentatively entitled
&#8220;Raps.&#8221; Fascinated with rhyme, he wanted to create lyric, not
unlike beat box rappers of the mid-eighties. Goldsmith worked extensively with
the rhyming dictionary, forming quirky, tantalizing, and sometimes, according
to the author, just plain bad poetic texts. Using his sculpture background, he
toyed with formatting, the look and feel of the words on the page. The results
were often discarded, kept in the back of a cabinet in a file folder, though
the collection continued to grow. The &#8220;Raps&#8221; became larger,
consecutively numbered until they were no longer tiny pops of rhyme, but long
rumbles of poetry. Goldsmith dropped the title of &#8220;Raps&#8221; as his
writing progressed down the number line into the hundreds, and he started to
use them as working ideas for his next series of work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Intent on maximizing his text
pieces, Goldsmith produced for the public the first of his
&#8220;numbered&#8221; works, three over-sized panels with columns of words and
phrases silk screened onto the canvas. He called them, collectively, <i>No.105
5.23.92-6.21.92, </i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>titled
by where they fell in the number line, and the dates that the phrases were
recorded<i> </i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
words were justified in two columns each corresponding to the width of an
average human body, representational of the information that makes up the mind,
body and soul. <i>No.105</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'> was a &#8220;reading&#8221; experience rather than a
&#8220;viewing&#8221; experience, because Goldsmith put more emphasis on the
writing than the on visual representation of the phrases. Unfortunately, a
gallery setting is made up of viewers not readers, and the text of <i>No.105</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> was probably written off in the
way that a young child writes off chapter books; too many words, not enough
pictures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Goldsmith employed the same formula
used in the rhyming dictionary, each phrase increasing in syllable length down
the page in alphabetical order, all with a unifying ending rhyme. In the case
of <i>No.105</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, all
the words ended with the &#8220;ee&#8221; sound, &#8220;beauty, bitchy;
complicity...&#8221;<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn13' href="martinez01.html#_edn13"
name="_ednref13" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![endif]></span></span></a>
The eight-foot panels were a bold move on the part of the artist, pushing the
limits and the tolerance of the art community. To counter the response of the
gallery crowd, Goldsmith decided to publish <i>No.105</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> in chapbook form, taking the text
and reformatting it for the page. When reduced to letter size paper, <i>No.105</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> suddenly became a work of
literature and was often reviewed as such. In the art world a distinction is
made between art and literature, art should be bold and often impressively
large, literature on the other hand should not; in the art world the two realms
do not intersect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><i>No.109 2.7.93-12.15.93</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> would prove the death knell for
Goldsmith&#8217;s career as an artist. The work was a series of nine eight-foot
tall panels that dominated an entire wall of the John Post Lee Gallery in New
York. (The work was later released in a chapbook as well.) <i>No.109</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> starts with a massive scream, and
ends on the final panel with disembodied laughter and a tiny sigh.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn14' href="martinez01.html#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[14]<![endif]></span></span></a>
The text is extremely performative, with parenthetical stage directions
throughout the laughing sequence, which end with &#8220;(all is quiet).&#8221;<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn15' href="martinez01.html#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[15]<![endif]></span></span></a>
In chapbook form the text is mystifying, like watching a cartoon movie through
your own viewer, which starts all distorted until you get the crank going,
sails through &#8220;snap-crackle-pop&#8221; action sequences, and then slowly,
quietly winds to a close. However, silk-screened and framed, the text proved
too overwhelming for the average gallery patron, but more on this later. Amidst
an alarmingly negative reaction only one panel sold. Frustrated and angry,
Goldsmith stormed out of the gallery limelight, taking his conceptual
&#8220;writing&#8221; elsewhere&#8212;overseas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When asked to participate in a
group show called &#8220;Construction in Process&#8221; in Lodz, Poland,
Goldsmith decided to push his language theory to the brink, in order to prove
to himself that the system and not the pieces were at fault. He decided to work
&#8220;solely in Polish, a language [he has never] spoken nor written.&#8221;<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn16' href="martinez01.html#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Imagine trying to write a meaningful piece in a language you do not understand,
but Goldsmith had a formula that worked brilliantly on <i>No.105</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> and <i>No.109</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, so he employed it in Poland as
well. Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8220;method of writing&#8221; allows him to rely
completely on audio, visual, or phonetic clues to link together words and
phrases; therefore it makes no difference if he understands them at all.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn17' href="martinez01.html#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[17]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Titled <i>No.110 10.4.93-10.7.93</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>, because it followed in the &#8220;Raps&#8221; sequence,
the piece was a 1500 word mural that was twelve feet tall and spanned the
length of a fifteen-foot wall. Camped out in a corner of the gallery, Goldsmith
clipped words and phrases from &#8220;Polish newspapers, magazines, and
pornography.&#8221;<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn18' href="martinez01.html#_edn18"
name="_ednref18" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[18]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Intrigued, local art students helping at the gallery began leaving clippings of
their own, or writing anonymous notes, which Goldsmith gleefully included. The
end result was, according to Goldsmith, &#8220;a collaboration in the truest
sense.&#8221;<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn19' href="martinez01.html#_edn19" name="_ednref19"

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><i>No.110</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> is an important link between the
highly &#8220;visual&#8221; texts of previous works and the published work of <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>. With the Polish collaboration,
Goldsmith demonstrated that poetic work is universally cooperative, that the
feelings and meanings words evoke do not rely on comprehending the language, or
on authorial intent, but simply on a well-executed design. The author himself
did not even understand what he wrote, but he did recognize that the work meant
something unique to every person who viewed it. Language is a powerful tool,
for both writer and artist. One thing all people have in common is the capacity
to understand, appreciate, and create systems of expression. The inherent
ability of all people to comprehend language in its various forms is essential
to Goldsmith&#8217;s work, because he shoves literature out of its everyday
associations and into new realms of existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The conception of <i>No.111 2.7.93-10.20.96</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> looks like something out of the
Big-Bang theory, a fantastic and perfectly timed gathering of all the right
elements, ending in a mind-staggering, and universe-altering explosion. It
proved to be Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8220;clean slate&#8221; as it were, his first
official act under the title of author. Using <i>No.111</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> as a guidebook a portrait of the
artist becomes strikingly clear, and through it one can learn the secrets of
Goldsmith&#8217;s language. <i>No.111</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'> certainly caused some cosmic disruption in the world of
literature, inciting old questions of meaning and intent, raising new ones like
appropriation in the age of the Internet, and ultimately leading Goldsmith to
fidget with language on a regular basis, not as a gallery artist, but as a
writer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
