<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">But <I>Fidget</I>, as Kenneth Goldsmith
has titled his recent verbal / visual experiment, is not literary
invention but <I>po&eacute;sie verit&eacute;</I>, a documentary
record of how it actually is when a person wakes up on a given
morning. If, in one sense, it recalls Beckett, it is also written
under the sign of the photographer Edward Muybridge. As Goldsmith
explains:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Fidget's</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">
premise was to record every move my body made on June 16, 1997
(Bloomsday). I attached a microphone to my body and spoke every
movement from 10:00 AM, when I woke up, to 11:00 PM, when I went
to sleep. I was alone all day in my apartment and didn't answer
the phone, go on errands, etc. I just observed my body and spoke.
From the outset the piece was a total work of fiction. As I sit
here writing this letter, my body is making thousands of movements;
I am only able to observe one at a time. It's impossible to describe
every move my body made on a given day. Among the rules for <I>Fidget</I>
was that I would never use the first person &quot;I&quot; to describe
movements. Thus every move was an observation of <I>a</I> body
in space, not <I>my</I> body in a space. There was to be no editorializing,
no psychology, no emotion-just a body detached from a mind.<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#3">3</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Telling the &quot;truth,&quot; Goldsmith
quickly discovers, may be the biggest &quot;fiction&quot; of all,
it being humanly impossible to track all of one's bodily movements.
At this very moment, I am moving my fingers over the computer
keyboard as I type, flexing my left foot, wiggling my left toes,
and running my tongue over my upper lip from right to left. As
I note those movements, I am making others that go unrecorded.
Indeed, as Goldsmith admits, after five hours of the experiment
in which he monitors his body as it gets out of bed and interacts
with objects like coffee cups, he &quot;began to go crazy.&quot;
The exercise becomes harder and harder, the verbal equivalents
to physical motion more and more abbreviated. By 6:00 PM, &quot;as
a defense my body put itself to sleep.&quot; When Goldsmith awakes
and realizes he had another five or six hours to go, he panics:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">I went out and bought a fifth of Jack
Daniels, walked over to an abandoned loading dock by the West
Side highway and drank the entire bottle, all the while continuing
my exercise. Needless to say, I got trashed. I found my home and
fell asleep by 11:00 PM, never once having stopped my narrative.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Later, when he plays the tapes, Goldsmith
finds that in the drunk sequence, his words have become completely
slurred and in the last chapter (22:00), quite incomprehensible.
So, in a Beckettian move, &quot;I ran the first chapter backwards,
mirrored it, then reversed every letter.&quot; For example, &quot;Tongue
runs across lower lip, moving from right side of mouth to the
left following arc of lip,&quot; becomes</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">The sentences from this last chapter
were then put into reverse order with the last actions coming
first, and the first coming last.<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#4">4</A></SUP> The only exception is the very
last line of the book, &quot;Eyelids close,&quot; which is printed
in standard order, &quot;creating a full circle of closure for
the day&quot; And further: the tapes were then rigorously edited:
all unnecessary words such as &quot;the&quot; were removed as
were all possible literary and art references. The aim was to
make the text &quot;very dry and very descriptive&quot; and &quot;to
divorce the action from the surroundings, narrative, and attendant
morality.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">These statements must be taken with
a grain of salt. For one thing, the &quot;closure&quot; provided
by the final sentence of the thirteenth chapter, &quot;Eyelids
close,&quot; is called into question by the various versions in
which <I>Fidget</I> exists. The piece, which exists as a plain
text version<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#5">5</A></SUP>, was given a gallery installation at Printed Matter 
<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#6">6</A></SUP>, a performance at the Whitney Museum of American Art
at Philip Morris (16 June 1998)<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#7">7</A></SUP>, and a &quot;fidgetty&quot; &quot;Java
Applet&quot; electronic site, made in collaboration with programmer
Clem Paulsen<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#8">8</A></SUP>. But more important: the ostensibly &quot;dry&quot;
and &quot;descriptive&quot; report of successive body motions
quickly takes on an air of surreality as the artist poses the
question of what it would mean to be aware of every physical motion
one makes. The more empirical and detailed the verbal transcript,
the more absurd the attempt to &quot;translate&quot; body motion
begins to seem. Faced with a welter of ceaseless and simultaneous
movements, the mind censors out about 99% of these movements and
subjects the rest to increasing interpretation. The &quot;factual&quot;
account thus becomes more and more idiosyncratic, and what <I>Fidget</I>
celebrates with perverse charm is the victory of mind over matter,
and the inability to convey what we call body language except
through language. The text is thus a devastating send-up of the
now all-pervasive Foucault-inspired discourse on bodily primacy
, a discourse that, in the wake of Elaine Scarry's famed <I>The
Body in Pain</I>, generates such book titles as <I>Apocalyptic
Bodies</I>, <I>The Body in Parts</I>, <I>Leaky Bodies and Boundaries</I>,
and <I>Performing the Body</I><SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#9">9</A></SUP>. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Consider, for example, the narrator's
account in chapter 2 (11:00) of going to the bathroom and urinating:</FONT>
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Why is this description of the most
ordinary and trivial of human acts so unsettling? Whereas a satirist
like Swift, in &quot;A Voyage to Brobdingnag,&quot; reveals the
inherent hideousness of the human body by means of gigantism (&quot;[The
nurse's Breast] stood prominent six Foot and could not be less
than sixteen in Circumference. The Nipple was about half the Bigness
of my Head, and the Hue both of that and the Dug so varified with
Spots, Pimples and Freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous&quot;)<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#10">10</A></SUP>,
Goldsmith is determined to keep his eye, so to speak, on the ball,
to record noncommittally and nonjudgmentally the way the body
actually works. And yet that very &quot;objectivity&quot; has
the Swiftian effect of demonstrating the stark disconnect between
the physical and the mental, between the rote performance of the
bodily function and the human ability to &quot;form words.&quot;
As the &quot;eyes see face&quot; in the mirror, the implicit question
seems to be Hamlet's: &quot;Is man no more than this?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In breaking down bodily functions
into their smallest components, Goldsmith defamiliarizes the everyday
in ways that recall such Wittgensteinian questions as &quot;Why
can't the right hand give the left hand money?&quot; In ordinary
discourse we take a verb like &quot;walk&quot; for granted, without
dwelling on the fact that &quot;Walk&quot; means to alternate
the forward motion of right foot and left foot. When we refer
to a man urinating, we don't usually note that the steam of urine
&quot;emerges from within buttocks.&quot; And when we say someone
&quot;speaks,&quot; we don't bother to add that &quot;Mouth moves&quot;
or that &quot;Lips form words.&quot; &quot;Four fingers comb hair
away from hairline toward back of head&quot;: it couldn't be a
more common gesture but the standard reference would be &quot;to
push the hair out of one's face.&quot; The near-rhyming locution
&quot;four fingers comb hair . . . from&quot; takes a moment to
recognize for what it is. And when in chapter 3 (12:00), Goldsmith
has his morning cup of coffee, the ritual becomes more elaborate
than a ballet number or an athletic contest:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Back on back of chair. Legs touch
legs. Arms parallel arms of chair. Hands grasp end of arms. Legs
push back. Feet flat on ground. Elbow on arm. Arms out. Cup to
mouth. Swallow. Cup put down. Teeth outside mouth. Legs lift.
Legs stretch on legs ninety degrees. Grasp paper towels. Slide
to front. Left hand grasps right. Pull away from left. Left hand
stretches. Fold. (<I>Fidget</I> 14).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">The relation of human arms and legs
to the metaphoric arms and legs of a chair, the place of the teeth
as one opens one's mouth wide enough to drink, the movement one
makes when folding a paper towel-all these take on an aura of
gravity as if something of great importance is taking place, something
in need of urgent commentary.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">But of course such self-consciousness,
or more properly body consciousness cannot be sustained and so
the entries get shorter and shorter and by the time we get to
chapter 9 (18:00), we read the following:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Reach. Grasp. Reach Grab. Hold. Saw.
Pull. Hold. Grab. Push. Itch. Push. Push. Turn. Walk. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Turn. Chew. Massage. Gather. Heavy.
Slower. Reach. Open. Swallow. Exhale. Stand. Burp. Grab. Turn.
Pick. Grab. Grab. Grab. Open. (<I>Fidget</I> 55).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Mostly monosyllabic verbs without
subjects or objects, often distinguished by a single letter as
in &quot;Grasp&quot;/ &quot;Grab,&quot; and permutating through
the chapter which ends with the rhyme &quot;Raise. Gaze.&quot;
In the next chapter (&quot;19:00&quot;), drinking has begun and
all hell breaks loose. The objective reporter now gives way to
the inventor of language play:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Refinger. Sneeze cross. Length of
fore wipes free. Hand sad. Runs at bottom of thigh, no eye. Calflex.
Peripheral movements spoken. Breath cools down right side. Jaws
find teeth clenched. Outer part of lower fang, most pronounced
grinding backward and forward. (<I>Fidget </I>57)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">And two pages further down:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Spinger thumb. Now is lift. Thumb
to flip. Now thumb. Indents forefinger. Crease unnaturally lumpy.
Right and right is face down on ground. Riched lightly. Arching
four and blade middle and not touching ground. Still harrow. Body
is sit. Licks wet. (<I>Fidget</I> 58)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">The more the language of description
breaks down into non-sense and neologism, the greater, ironically
enough, the need to make value judgements. The hand is now unaccountably
&quot;sad,&quot; the &quot;eye,&quot; missing, the &quot;crease&quot;
(between fingers?) &quot;unnaturally lumpy.&quot; One cannot,
it seems, remain detached from one's body, from one's <I>own</I>
reactions. &quot;Slight pleasure gained from dig into finger and
then pleasured by sharpness,&quot; remarks the narrator (<I>Fidget</I>
59), now wanting to put <I>his</I> stamp on events as they occur.
The language becomes <I>his</I> language and the next chapter
(&quot;20:00&quot;) opens with the sentence &quot;Whitehead and
watch after left hand,&quot; where the first word in initial (and
hence capitalized) position, refers not only to a whitehead or
mole found on the left hand, but to the philosopher Alfred North
Whitehead, whose famous Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness (e.g.,
if a tree falls in the forest when no one is there to hear it
fall, does it make a sound?) is apropos to Goldsmith's narrative.
The poet further puns on &quot;watch,&quot; which looks ahead
to the phrase &quot;In the pocket worthwhile&quot; in the next
sentence. And the creation of a new language field leads to the
finale with its reversal of words (see figure 1), giving us new
entities like &quot;.petS .drawkcab teeF (&quot;Feet backward.
Step&quot;). The reversed linear flow makes a key word of &quot;morf&quot;
(&quot;from&quot;), a word highly applicable in the context along
with &quot;woble&quot; (&quot;elbow&quot;), &quot;pil&quot; (&quot;lip&quot;),
and the mysterious &quot;evom&quot; (&quot;move&quot;), which
looks like a number or symbol in a Cabbalistic game. The morfing
landscape is full of &quot;sredluohs&quot; (&quot;shoulders&quot;),
&quot;eugnot&quot; (&quot;tongue&quot;) and there is much &quot;dna&quot;
(&quot;and&quot;) about. It seems, finally, that the language
game has occluded the multiform activities of the moving body.
And so &quot;Eyelids close.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Here, then, in Beckett's words about
<I>Finnegans Wake</I>, &quot;form <I>is </I>content, content <I>is</I>
form. [The] writing is not <I>about</I> something; <I>it is that
something itself</I><SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#11">11</A></SUP>.&quot; But the paradox-and this is a new
development in poetics at the turn of the twenty-first century-the
written text is only one of <I>Fidget</I>'s realizations. Earlier,
I mentioned the Whitney installation, the musical performance
score, and the Java Applet. Let me now say a further word about
this latter electronic version, which reconfigures the text of
<I>Fidget</I> by substituting the computer for the human body.
As Goldsmith explains: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">The Java Applet contains the text
reduced further into its constituent elements, a word or a phrase.
The relationships between these elements is structured by a dynamic
mapping system that is organized visually and spatially instead
of grammatically. In addition, the Java applet invokes duration
and presence. Each time the applet is downloaded it begins at
the same time as set in the user's computer and every mouse click
or drag that the user initiates is reflected in the visual mapping
system. The different hours are represented in differing font
sizes, background colors and degree of &quot;fidgetness,&quot;
however, these parameters may be altered by the user. The sense
of time is reinforced by the diminishing contrast and eventual
fading away of each phrase as each second passes.<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#12">12</A></SUP> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Time is speeded up in the Applet so
that each hour period takes approximately five to seven minutes
to complete. The viewing of the Java Applet from any specific
site would take about eighty minutes, and then the cycle begins
all over again. No one, of course, is likely to sit at the screen
for the full cycle, but even a few minutes of access reveal some
interesting facets of <I>Fidget</I>. When the text's linear momentum
is replaced by spatial organization, words interact in new ways.
Thus, in the case of the opening sequence ('Eyelids open. Tongue
runs cross upper lip. . . . Grind. Stretch. Swallow), in the electronic
version &quot;swallow&quot; appears center stage and rests on
top of &quot;Tongue runs across upper lip&quot;; it is then replaced
by &quot;grind&quot; and &quot;stretch,&quot; the words grinding
against one another and causing a kind of traffic jam as the screen
fills up with what looks like a spider web of action verbs connected
by lines that appear straight, then bend and stretch. But in the
visual mapping system, verbs like &quot;bend,&quot; &quot;clench,&quot;
and &quot;swallow,&quot; detached from their subject and object
nouns, and given relatively equal weight, become less referential,
less narrative, and-oddly-less male-oriented. In its book version,
<I>Fidget</I> is quite obviously a man's narrative, especially
in the masturbation passage in the fourth chapter (&quot;13:00&quot;).
But in the Applet, words appear as <I>words</I> rather than as
<I>signifiers</I> of X or Y, morphology and physical appearance
taking precedence over denotations. In the &quot;15:00&quot; chapter,
for example, the opening sentences &quot;Left hand grasps. Right
hand grasps&quot; are transformed into overprint, intersecting
and coming apart on the yellow 15:00 background (figure 3), marking
their symbiosis as do &quot;lifts&quot; and &quot;lips,&quot;
and those &quot;elbows&quot; appear, replace one another, and
disappear in what looks like a balletic structure. As a visual
and kinetic space, <I>Fidget</I> has an austere and silent beauty
quite different from the printed version or from its oral enactment,
for, as seen on the screen, this language has neither memory nor
agency. Indeed, the elegance of the clean, undifferentiated visual
space suggests that, as the poet Tan Lin put it, &quot;the mind
is only vestigially connected to the body 'it speaks' through.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#13">13</A></SUP>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">And yet-and here is a further irony-the
training ground for producing this electronic text, I would argue,
may be found in Goldsmith's earlier, and by no means &quot;elegant,&quot;
written work,<I> No. 111 2.7.93-10.20.96</I> -- his encyclopedic
poem based on words ending in the sound <I>ah</I> (<I>schwa</I>
according to phoneticians), a collection of words drawn from conversations,
books, phone calls, radio shows, newspapers, television, and especially
the Internet, that was arranged alphabetically and by syllable
count (from single-syllable words beginning with A-&quot;A, a,
aar, aas, aer, agh, ah air&quot; -- to D. H. Lawrence's complete
&quot;The Rocking Horse Winner&quot;) so as to create a Gargantuan
poetic reference book or archive on the <I>argot </I>of our times
<SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#14">14</A></SUP>. The sensitivity to language displayed in <I>No.
111,</I> a text still subject to conscious arrangement rather
than indiscriminate recording as in <I>Fidget</I>, clears the
ground for the onscreen paragrammatic possibilities we now witness
in Goldsmith's work. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">&quot;If literature is defined as
the exploration and exercise of tolerable linguistic deviance,&quot;
write Jed Rasula and Steve McCaffery in the introduction to their
new anthology <I>Imagining Language</I> , &quot;the institutional
custodianship of literature serves mainly to protect the literary
work from language, shielding it from the disruptive force of
linguistic slippage.&quot; <SUP><A HREF="perloff_goldsmith.html#15">15</A></SUP> Such slippage has increasingly become
a poetic norm, creating a new poetics we might call <I>differential</I>.
For Goldsmith's text is not &quot;intermedia&quot; in the usual
sense (e.g., word + image or word set to music or recited on film)
but a work that has been produced <I>differentially </I>in alternate
media, as if to say that <I>knowledge</I> is now available through
different channels and by different means. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Indeed, one of the great pleasures
of <I>Fidget</I> is that its differential mode allows for an unusual
degree of reader / listener / viewer participation: it is the
reader, after all, who must decide whether to access the 20:00
chapter of <I>Fidget</I>, in which case s/he cannot &quot;read&quot;
the other twelve chapters, or whether to &quot;read&quot; linearly
by moving from page to page of the written text. Reading--looking-listening-surfing:
this is a work that gives <I>engagement</I> a whole new dimension.

to Goldsmith (letter to the author, 9 October 1998) consisted
of &quot;twelve paper suits (one for each hour of the day). Each

of American Art (June 16, 1998), Theo Bleckmann, the lead singer
for Meredith Monk, &quot;stood high on a balcony in the museum
and dropped sheets of paper printed with each word as he sang
them. These sheets of paper were picked up by a pair of twin children
and brought to a team of seamstresses, who sewed them into a suit
during the course of the hour-long performance. When Bleckmann
had finished singing, the then-finished suit was hoisted up to
his balcony, where he donned the language/ actions that he had
just spoken/sung. Hence, a full circle was created&quot; (letter
to the author, 9 Oct. 1998). In an article for <I>Poliester</I>
(Fall 1998), Bill Arning, who attended the performance, reports:
&quot;To hear the expulsion of morning mucus from the nostrils
ethereally sung by Bleckmann was as startlingly incongruous as
to read such an unsensational act described by Goldsmith as if
it were a recipe for a difficult but exquisite souffle.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">I was inspired by the explanation
given to me regarding the sacred significance of the Sanskrit
word <I>aum.</I> It seems that when one speaks this word, all
parts of the mouth are engaged. . . . My function for the next
3 years was that of a collector of language. . . . I would carry
around a portable dictaphone and a notepad and whenever I would
encounter one of these [<I>ah</I> ] sounds, I would &quot;capture&quot;
it. At first, my idea was to take all sounds regardless of their
content. . . . perhaps, I thought, with this system I could subvert
the normal function of language (communication) and invoke a less
conventional idea (although not without precedent) of language
as pure music. And language is a great medium to do this with
because no matter how much one collects for sound alone, there
is <I>always</I> meaning.&quot;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
