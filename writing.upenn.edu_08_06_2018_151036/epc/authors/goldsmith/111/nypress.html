<font color=000000>Sculpting With Words: It Figures</font><BR>
<BR>
Kenneth Goldsmith's new book begins at what looks and sounds like the beginning 
of language itself:
<blockquote>
&quot;A, a, aar, aas, aer, agh, ah, air, &auml;r, are, arh, arre, arrgh, ars, aude, aw, awe, Ayr, Ba, 
ba, baa, baaaahh, baar, bah, bar, bard, bare, barge, barre, Bayer, beer, bere, beurre, bier, 
bla, blah, Blair, blare, bleh, blur, boar, board, Boer, boor, bore, bored, Boz, bra, bras, 
Brer, brrrr, bur, burr...&quot; And so on, C to &quot;Za, zha, Zsa.&quot;
</blockquote>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Section two begins with &quot;A door, &agrave; la, a pear, a peer, a rear, a ware, A woah!&quot; and 
proceeds to &quot;Zima, zinger, zonder, zoospore, zooter, Zsa Zsa, zuder.&quot; He's up to 
three syllables in the next section (&quot;...off center, off color, off kilter, oh brother, Oh 
<I>mother</I>!, oh yes there, old geezer, old timer, on vapors, on welfare...&quot;), four in the next 
(&quot;...Dr. Bronner's, Dr. Pepper, Sr. Sphincter, drain the monster, draw &amp; quarter, 
Drew Barrymore...&quot;), seven (A baby eating razors, a baby in a blender, a baby in the nuker, 
a bitcher and a moaner...&quot;) and so on--to 38-syllable &quot;phrases&quot; in section 38, 89 in 
89, then 137, 232, 356, 601, 1193, 1887...<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Until the final section, a single &quot;phrase&quot; that's exactly 7228 syllables long. And 
just happens to be the entire text of D.H. Lawrence's &quot;The Rocking Horse Winner.&quot; 
And just happens to fit the rather rigorous rules by which the entire book is 
organized, something about every passage having to end with some variation on the &quot;R&quot; 
sound--ar, er, ur, etc.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Along the way, the book's stuffed with quotations from limericks and 
commercials, books and the Internet, pop songs and magazines, TV and movie dialogue, 
telephone conversations, journal entries, the <I>National 
Enquirer</I> and <I>The New York Times</I> and 
<I>NYPress</I> and, finally, apparently, everywhere else. It's a 606-page tour de force of 
... <I>something</I>. Linguistic OCD maybe? As a colleague here said on leafing through it, 
if all of Dublin could be recreated from the pages of 
<I>Ulysses</I>, America could maybe be rebuilt form this. It's like this guy Goldsmith has tried to collect and put into 
some sort of intuitive poetic-logic order every sound, idiom, and rhythm of 
contemporary English-in-praxis. Organized by sound and syllable count, it all quickly takes on 
the roly-poly, humpty-dumpty rhythmical ridiculousness of doggerel and 
children's rhymes. Which is okay with Goldsmith, who laugh at it himself, calling it &quot;a 
useless encyclopedic reference work&quot; and &quot;a rhyming dictionary taken to obscene 
lengths.&quot; Other points of reference range from Walter Abish's 
<I>Alphabetical Africa</I> to those cabalists using computer-programmed Gematria to unlock the alpha-numerically 
coded secret messages in the Old Testament.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Even the title is about counting and listing: 
<I>No. 111 2.7.93-10.20,96</I> (The Figures, $17.50). Even the publisher's name seems a glancing pun--The Figures. (It's a New England press that puts out experimental writers and Language poets like 
Clark Coolidge, Ron Padgett and Ron Silliman.)<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Goldsmith works out of the Cable Bldg., where he shares a closet-sized office with 
a big dog named Babette, a computer, hundreds of vinyl LPs and a Mr. Coffee 
who looks like he gets lots of use. Now in his mid-30s, Goldsmith started out a 
sculptor--graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1984--and he's always had 
a sculptural approach to language.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Literally, at first: in 1987, he cast a metal sculpture of Abbie Hoffman's 
<I>Steal This Book</I> that was so big and heavy you couldn't. &quot;The idea was like the revolution that 
never got off the ground,&quot; he deadpans. Four Walls Eight Windows, which was 
getting ready to put out an edition of Abbie's collected works, asked if they could throw 
the book party at Goldsmith's then Forsyth St. loft, with the giant 
<I>Steal This Book</I> for photo ops. &quot;I had this image of Abbie and me with our arms around each 
other,&quot; Goldsmith recalls--but Hoffman committed suicide before the party could happen.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Goldsmith's art developed backward, you might say, from whole books to the bits 
and pieces, the morphemes and phonemes, of language itself. Since the early 90s he's 
been showing at places like The Drawing Center and Bravin Post Lee Gallery, 
hanging large panels printed with various kinds of text on them. His 
 <A HREF="http://www.ubuweb.com/vp/contemp/goldsmith/goldsmith_la.html">73 Poems</A> (Permanent Press / <A HREF="http://www.lovely.com">Lovely Music, Ltd.</A>, 1993) was a series of visual poems juxtaposing--and 
visually overlapping--rhyming colloquialisms like JUST SAY NO /I WANNA 
B JACKIE O / SOCIALISMO O MUERTO. (&quot;I wanted to make it look like 
conceptual art, but make it read like the juiciest trash you ever read.&quot;) As in Zen koans 
or Marshall McLuhans's &quot;probes,&quot; the meaning can seem accidental, 
fortuitous--and revelatory. Goldsmith turned <I>73 
Poems</I> into a limited edition chapbook that included 
a CD by <A HREF="http://www.newalbion.com/artists/labarbaraj/">Joan La Barbara</A>, the avant-vocalist best known for her work with John 
Cage, interpreting the visual poems as sound poetry.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">As gallery art, panels of that stuff went over okay. But then, Goldsmith says, &quot;I 
began including too many words for the art world audience, who do not like language, 
number one, and who want a quick hit, number two.&quot;
Too many words? <I>No. 111 2.7.93-10.20.96</I> was a three-year-plus (Feb. 7, '93, to 
Oct. 20 '96) collecting process of sounds, words, phrases, and whole texts organized 
alphabetically, phonetically, rhythmically and syllabically according to the rules he set 
for himself. Once he's into a project like this and his &quot;antennae are up,&quot; Goldsmith 
say, he's hearing everything in rhymes and syllables--things on the radio, lyrics in 
songs, things you say to him. If it fits somewhere in his scheme, it goes in.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">The result is a kind of mosaic map of Goldsmith's world, and ours, during the 
time he's collecting. For a project that could seam so meaningless, it has a strange 
immediacy, a kind of documentary feel. By the point you get up to bits of eight, 10, 
20 syllables, the accidental meanings can be unaccountably humorous:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;nothing's gonna change my clothes every anymore, now get your meaty paws 
away from that buzzer, now there's a question that ought to get us somewhere, Objects 
In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear, objects of desire that once defined their eras, 
of course {NAK} (sense 2) i.e. &quot;I'm not here&quot;, oh my sagging gonads, aching 
pulsating sore, &quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed &quot;It's like a dick but much smaller!&quot;, On the next Phil: 
Real Incest and Real Survivors...&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">On the other hand, they can be oddly moving, as though you're picking up echoes 
of the mood Goldsmith was in as he constructed a specific section: &quot;Einstein once 
asked with sadness and wonder, either of the higher or the lower, Emily Dickinson 
worse than ever, emphasize how glad you are to see her, endure no light being 
themselves obscure...&quot;<BR>

<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">And when the bits get much longer, like 43 syllables, you get wonderful business like:

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Eeeaaarrrghh! I pictured smashing his face in...kicking his scrotum back into 
his torso...digging the fucker's eyes out...going for a field goal with his head over 
and over..., even if it is not good for us we become addicted. And we become 
enslaved. And when we become enslaved we are constantly thinking of that thing wherever 
we are, from the mountains to the prairies...FUCK MISS AMERIKA...to 
the oceans...NO NO HO CHI MINH...white with foam...1 2 3 4 WE DON'T 
WANT YOUR FUCKING WAR...God bless Amerika, grab me Chewie. I'm 
slipping--hold on. Grab it almost...you almost got it. Gently now all right easy easy hold me 
Chewie. Chewie! With a little higher just a little higher...&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">If you count between the commas, there are 43 syllables in each of those segments. 
Or should be. &quot;I counted every syllable in this book by hand,&quot; Goldsmith explains. In 
fact, after collecting all 606 pages' worth of fragments, he spent an entire year just 
counting and recounting the syllables. &quot;It was this whole kind of churning through. Nobody 
has {computer} programs that could count all those things, so I had to count them 
by hand..., And I'm sure there are many mistakes, although I counted the entire 
thing through <I>four times</I>. I know there are still mistakes. I kind of figure they're still 
finding corrections in <I>Finnegans Wake</I>.&quot;<BR>

<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Goldsmith's most recent gallery show used language in a different, but equally 
eccentric, way. For seven days, he tape-recorded every word he spoke. Every word. 
From, &quot;Good morning, how ya doin?&quot; at the start of Day One to, &quot;Good night Cheryl. I 
love you.&quot; (aw...) at the end of Day Seven. Then he transcribed the whole week, printed 
it on panels and covered every surface of the gallery with it. He called it 
<I>Soliloquy (No. 116 4.15.96-4.21.96).</I> The rationale was simply to see how much volume a 
week's worth of spoken language takes up. Or as he puts it in a kind of motto for the piece: 
<I>If every word spoken in New York City daily were somehow to materialize as a snowflake, 
each day there would be a blizzard</I>.<BR>

<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Goldsmith's love of sound (and maybe obscurity) comes out in another vein: he's 
been <A HREF="http://www.wfmu.org">WFMU</A>'s DJ Kenny G for two and a half years. &quot;A painter friend of mine was a 
friend of the station's, and they're always looking for DJs there because it's so fucking far 
out [in New Jersey],&quot; he explains. &quot;I got a phone call one day asking if I'd like to do 
a show. I said sure. It's always been a dream. So I threw an audition tape together 
and zap, I was on the radio.&quot;<BR>

<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Originally he did late-nights, but since January his &quot;Unpopular Music&quot; has been 
on Monday mornings, 9-noon. He has highbrow tastes, in a broad splay of idioms. 
He might segue from Giovanni Martinelli's &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot; to the Ronette's &quot;Baby 
I Love You.&quot; A recent program included stuff from the Beach Boys, Red Krayola, 
Steve Reich, Squadra di Bel Canto, Stravinsky, Noel Coward and Bob Dylan.<BR>

<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">Besides <A HREF="http://www.ubuweb.com">designing Web sites</A>--mostly from small presses, lit mags and 
independent labels--he's got a corner of FMU's site (<A HREF="http://www.wfmu.org/~kennyg">wfmu.org/~kennyg/</A>) and keeps up his 
own really elegant site (<A HREF="http://www.ubuweb.com/vp">www.ubuweb.com/vp</A>), dedicated to the &quot;largest visual, 
concrete, and sound poetry archive on the Web--and it's also the most beautiful,&quot; he 
smiles. He's right--it's a pretty amazing site. He's got dozens of RealAudio 
downloadable files of historical recordings by guys like Appolinaire and Kurt Schwitters 
performing their experimental poetics; concrete poetry by contemporary names like Dick 
Higgins, Alison Knowles, and Janet Zweig; a bunch of Clark Coolidge and Philip 
Guston's Picture-Poems, and a lot more.<BR>

<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">I was thinking about the all the smarts and industry Goldsmith puts into his 
pursuits when I got to this bit at the end of 
<I>No. 111</I>, in that 7228-syllable (he counted, 
he counted?) D.H. Lawrence story about a single-minded kid and his rocking horse:<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0"><I>At last he suddenly stopped forcing his horse into the mechanical gallop and slid down.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">&quot;Well, I got there!&quot; he announced fiercely, his blue eyes still flaring, and his sturdy long 
legs straddling apart.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">&quot;Where did you get to?&quot; asked his mother.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/dot_clear.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="0" BORDER="0">&quot;Where I wanted to go,&quot; he flared back at her.</I>
