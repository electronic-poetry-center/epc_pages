<P>
A blind man is sitting on a park bench. A rabbi sits down next to him. The rabbi is chomping on a piece of matzoh, a butterfly flapping its wings in China could dramatically change the weather in New York several months later, a deep realization today that after the ha-ha's there is <I>no</I> turning back -- a radical departure will occur, an intelligent person would not carry the raft around on his head after making it across to the other shore, And what of him? Must he give up his entire life just because he is her husband? Is he that tied to her and her career?, as he gazed into the still waters he noticed that his bruises had taken the appearance of a garland of flowers, as language was at its beginning merely oral and all words of necessary or common use were spoken before, because I'm the type of person who will blow $1,179 on a leather reading chair, because our time is necessarily limited one might carelessly conclude that all is lost and that nothing matters, Calls not returned -- not so much due to busyness but to lack of interest. Those who we once called our friends are no longer, eighty years later by a bizarre coincidence they lay in the same hospital on their deathbeds next to each other, everyone had a twisted childhood so I'm making them go through it all again -- but this time around they'll make it better, from there I began to unravel all the value judgments that I had been building for as long as I could remember, Gigli was a supporter of Mussolini -- published a book called "Why I Am A Fascist" and often sang for Hitler, had to be something though could it be that I wasn't using the right shampoo or maybe I didn't drink the right soda, he caused the workmen to begin to speak in different languages so that they could not communicate with each other, I found a new desire and enjoyment in rambling about whatever seems appropriate at the time. So here we are, I had the recorder on so it was just crazy to listen to it over and over again on the recorder, I hate it that my wife is drop dead beautiful because I can't even turn my damn head without some fool hitting on her, I hate it when men have hair on their backs. Especially when it's really dark and it comes out of the back of their trousers, I only have problems w/Kathy Jo when she's going on about those sucky Counting Crows and their doofus lead singer, I spend most of my free-time whittling prosthetic limbs from driftwood that washes up along the banks of the LA river, I wake up the earliest 1:00 pm eat my corn pops watch a video rub my eyes if I stink I shower, I would hope to be more like a woman than a man actually -- men have proved that they really can't get it together, If you were tooooo skinny they wouldn't want to have anything to do with you either. People want to have healthy partners, it's kinda like saying that the airplane was invented in Egypt 2000 years ago because they had toy gliders, Jesus did not rise from the dead. The Popes have kept his body in a dungeon under the Vatican for 2000 years, just give me my few minutes up there because I can't get enough of it. I'll tell you anything just give me the cover, Mom's left fallopian tube has a bunch of guys who speak Latin fighting constantly about the price of tea in China, most prominent is a glottal stop replacing the letter "T" so that the word "butter" for example comes out "bu'er", must fall silent at this point satisfied that it has embedded within itself enough clues for its intended readers, Oh c'mon how many of you have NEVER looked on the back of a greeting card to see how much the card cost the sender?, oh how I truly love the snow when it comes down upon us it flurries and flitters and flies through the air sticking to hair, one of Brando's great loves was a woman who vengefully slept with his grown son in the midst of their long turbulent affair, or a structure based on the unique needs of the individual rather than the monolithic version of power, paranoia is a fascinating mechanism by which a person tends to bring about the very thing he most fears, placed equidistant between two equal haystacks it starved to death being unable to choose either one or the other, pomo he cd deal with modernism wd be harder. interesting point tho: hard to say which yrs is. but why bother?, Q: What would be the ultimate tour for you guys? A: If we could tour with George Clinton and Bill Clinton together, she actually said to me "Now all the boys are reading Robert Bly and all the girls are reading Camille Paglia", she later confessed to throwing them away in the forest -- they were awful in every respect: taste texture and color, "Show me a happy person and I'll show you a person who's not in a relationship." -- Men's Movement guru John Bradshaw, so you're a 15 year old virgin. Don't worry the hormone surge will subside once you figure out what your winky is for, the next few hours are so compressed that after it's over you need a month to catch up. Every second seems to last an hour, there is always time for nightlife but did you check out some of the more beautiful places our crazy world has to offer?, we wish you a Merry Christmas we wish you a Merry Christmas we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, we're going to do the same things that we did for our customers before but this time it's going to be even better, when I began this work I chose a classic and banal typeface Caslon and have never had any need for another, while your friend is sleeping carefully water down his mattress (if he sleeps in a waterbed just give it a few punctures), Why are the innocent dead and the guilty alive? Where is justice? Where is punishment? Or have you already answered?;
