Hey Dick have you ever been a quitter? I have never been a quitter ... to leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent in every instinct in my body but as President I must put the interests of America, "I know you don't write them for a conservative generation however if I were you Kenny I would tray to avoid arrangements like 'Treblinka Vibrator (unless it means something different in Polish) Heil Hitler Heinrich Himmler, I woke up at 2 a.m. with a splitting headache. I took two Tylenol almost crying from the pain. A 1/2 hour later I was still no better so I chewed 2 extra strength aspirin. It tasted like shit but chewing it made it work faster, just imagine how distressing it is to have 40 headless insects about 3 inches long propelling themselves around like random puss missiles and just because they are headless doesn't mean they are easier to catch or don't jump as far, let me tell you something -- my parents were both high when they married and they were high when they made me. So I am grateful to the pot plant. Let's legalize the good weed folks. I am living proof that good weed makes good people. POT -- the plant of the future!!, Saw Steve in the street. "Hey man I really liked your piece at Sonnabend." "Thanks" I replied. "It was my tribute to Abbie Hoffman and to the 25<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of Woodstock." "Oh I didn't get all that. I never read my art -- ever, The MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour is nothing more than a bunch of boring people sitting around arguing over boring stuff. Get rid of that roundtable discussion stuff. I think they need to make it more like American Gladiators, we both share a nice cup of tea when half way through I inform you that I have actually pissed in it. What d'ya do about it? Take me outside and beat me with a piece of 2 by 4. Pass it off as my "funny little" sense of humor, when asked "Is there not a difference between that which a revolutionist does and that which a policeman does?" Tolstoy answered: "There is as much difference between cat-shit and dog-shit but I don't like the smell of either one or the other";
