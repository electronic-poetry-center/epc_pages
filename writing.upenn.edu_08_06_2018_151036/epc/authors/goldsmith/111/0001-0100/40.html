A number of them conglobulate together by flying round and round and then all in a heap throw themselves under water and lye in the bed of a river, Americaine burst like grapeseeds from Paris terraces ... sweeping strings tr&egrave;s hi fi society brisk ... whirring purring ... gay cyclical Sartrian strains ... hers all hers, and if one were to take a random sample of your saliva right now and put it under a microscope one would find all kinds of viral shit festering there, drunken pandemonium ensued until late in the night -- things wound down with a fire in the backyard of the museum and all of us eating roasted kielbasa, "During one holiday season" she recalls with a snicker "there were twenty five people inside me who all wanted to give Christmas presents to one another", I jammed the disposable plastic handle of my razor into the electric socket and started a chain of events that left my home in ash and cinders, I'm a drug addict who was abused by my father now I spend my time trying to get affirmation from strangers. I wish I could still take drugs! Blackouts are pure, if a hottentot tutor taught a hottentot tot to talk ere the tot could totter should the hottentot tot be taught to say aught or naught or what should be taught her, meanwhile the nerds -- the non-sixties people who were all around us who were untouched by Andy Warhol and by the Rolling Stones and by Jimi Hendrix -- gained power, most women are introspective: "Am I in love? Am I emotionally and creatively fulfilled?" Most men are outrospective: "Did my team win? How's my car?", now the common man in America eats Wonder bread (like a wet white pillow) while the descendants of nobility go to the health food store for granola, open any book to page 50 and they all look pretty much the same -- it's the way that the words are being used that distinguishes one author from another, <U>POEMS FOR ALL: A poem called "Short Lived"</U> by "Me" -- Marilyn Mansfield <U>A flower in the wind / A flower on the shore / A beauteous creation / But... / Not forevermore!</U>, polls show us to be greater risk-takers more likely to do things that would result in self-harm and more materialistic than our predecessors the Boomers, Regard women as inferior therefore more sinister. These philosophical finalities gently entered my ear as they jammed me with a coat hanger, resources here seem incredibly overwhelming when you realize authors in Cuba hand stitch and bind their works together often using old cloth as paper, save the bones from your meal and explain that you're taking them home to your invalid senile old mother because it's a lot cheaper than actually feeding her, Shit Happens Rama Rama Ding Ding. She-it happens She-it happens happens happens she-it she-it (repeat until you become one with she-it) please this flower, teriyaki sauce with generous portions garlic powder black pepper and Grandma's Spicy Chili Powder can turn regular hamburgers into Godburgers, there never was a city kid truer and bluer never did me in the corner with a good looking daughter dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter, There will be a Moscow Exhibition of Arts by 15000 Soviet Republic painters and sculptors. These were executed over the past two years, we have judged ourselves and others by the objects we possess. We have always craved more and more. We now remove that and need less want less. We are in some way freer, when the dog jumped into the pond at the park a police officer ran over ordered us to remove the dog and informed us that there were living things in there, yes my favorite color is purple. When I was little it was green then it was red then blue and now it's purple. (I suppose there's some sort of progression there);
