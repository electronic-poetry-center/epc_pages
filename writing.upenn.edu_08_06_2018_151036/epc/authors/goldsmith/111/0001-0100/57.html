As I look around at what I've surrounded myself with I see a sea of misery brainwashing competition insecurity narcissism and neurosis. I must have played the game as well to attract these characters, Satan the Devil as an over-wrought "I'm so evil because I worship Satan" caricature. If we could kill the Devil person&aelig; then maybe there'd be less annoying teenagers &amp; self-idolizing rebels out there, that comfortable fleshy mound on which you sit (on which you are probably sitting RIGHT NOW!). That jolly round fat-cushion on top of which most North Americans spend the bulk of their time. Thus I dedicate the following &#156;uvre, "There is no difference between high and low. Our generation is fortunate enough to listen to Nancy Sinatra and Joan Sutherland and appreciate them equally for what they do" he wrote in the local paper;
