<P>
And you cannot believe that you actually gave these people power over your life for so long. And you feel sad sad for them sad for yourself sad for all the pain accumulated over those many years, but the remaining stuff stayed pretty thick 'til the last couple months when it started to get this fucked up frizz texture.

What comes in between the first letter of the sentence and the sound of the final syllable really doesn't matter;
