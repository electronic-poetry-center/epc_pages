As I became farther and farther removed from the artworld I began to see what slaves the artists were -- a world of fear and of a monolithic vertical structure to which all cowered, Betty Botter bought some butter but she said this butter's bitter. If I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter. But a bit of better butter will make my batter better, during lunch I felt myself slip into a predetermined role of what I should have been: a self-important-card-carrying-New-York-artist -- and played the role like a real character actor, ever urinated anywhere other than a bathroom outhouse tree bush or any commonly accepted piss hole (in the kitchen sink in the glove compartment of the family car)?, how curious: we should like to explain our understanding of a gesture by means of a translation into words and the understanding of words by translating them into a gesture, I recently had occasion to field-test the adaptive gonkulator. The price was right and the racing stripe on the case looked kind of neat but its performance left something to be desired, I was surprised to see him at the dance concert and asked why he was there. He told me that quite honestly the main reason was to sit in the front row and take in the asses of the dancers, My favorite drinking game is called "crashers": Everybody gets into their cars and drives up a winding mountain road. Every minute everybody accelerates 5 miles per hour faster, No. I also thought that in a dramatic art gesture I would publicly dedicate my life to "banging my head against the wall" in John's memory. This was a pretty neat idea, Rerun: Relax yourself girl let me love you now? Adele: Relax yourself girl take off your panties. Ahmed: Relax yourself girl you psychin' me out. missjones: Relax yourself girl let down your hair, revel in your maskenfreiheit you overstuffed blood sausage you wannabe brown shirt you nomenklatura you swine you vampire you loch ness slimeball you KGB reject you death monger, so little narrative or just as the narrative gets going it gets cut off -- just like life itself -- so many small details so much insignificance adding up to a great big picture, the Flintstones. I love The Flintstones 'cause they show how creative you can be without money. They got an elephant that washes dishes a bird that uses its beak to turn a record player, the X Generation is made up of Slackers Hackers (a.k.a. Phreakers Cyberpunks and Neuronauts) and New Jackers we are Ravers and Atari Wavers Stuck-in-the-'70s-ers, who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways &amp; firetrucks not even one free beer, Winifred Wagner's late correspondence (as late as the 1970's) was closed with the number "88" referring to the eighth letter of the alphabet and meaning "Heil Hitler";
