Have you ever eaten so much sugar you go completely utterly insane for a few minutes? One time at IHOP a friend and I insisted on tasting every kind of syrup they had and consumed so much sugar we both started to laugh maniacally at the slightest thing we turned red and nearly fell over, internet modems acid house brain implants.
