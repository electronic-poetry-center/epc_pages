<P>
I don't believe in Magic I don't believe in I-Ching I don't believe in Bible I don't believe in Tarot I don't believe in Hitler I don't believe in Jesus I don't believe in Kennedy I don't believe in Mantra I don't believe in Gita I don't believe in Yoga, I've always wanted to own a fur coat. Unfortunately my religion doesn't allow me to wear the hides of intelligent creatures. I've decided therefore that I'm going to kidnap Rush Limbaugh and rub his whole body with Monoxodil until he's ready for the slaughter, thinking whether or not I should go to his reading. I really don't feel like it. It's Saturday in late April during a warm April shower and to be honest I'd rather sit here at the kitchen table listen to Beethoven String Quartets and quietly work on the computer;
