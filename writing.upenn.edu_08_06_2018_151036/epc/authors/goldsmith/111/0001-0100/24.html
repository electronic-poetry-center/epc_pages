I had answers. Now I do not. I cannot find the answers, I was always expected to be at the top and if I didn't win to me that meant loser, I was quite touched for it crossed my mind that if anyone Kathy would have creamed me for improper, I'd go there but I don't care I'll go there it's just to stare let's go there it's just it's fair I'll go there, I'm afraid you'll have to go off the Prozac before we start dating -- it's making you crankier, I'm going to be one of those women who when she gets older has to use a Depends diaper, if there's a pothole outside your house you may have to wait a little longer to get it repaired, in a world where so much is imitation people now value the original more and more, in the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger as I buy the wedding ring for your finger, Is Jack Kerouac this country's most important critically unrecognized modern writer?, Is there any way to make my foot stop thumping the floor? Depends on how long my fingernails are, it is funny because -- well you know this -- how popular that word is among kids on the street here, It sucks when people use "May I help you?" as a synonym for "What the hell are you doing here?", it was the only place I went all week where I didn't see a laminated gavin goober, it wasn't like it would appear it all came down to skin and hair -- a racial kind of atmosphere, It's like you want it and I want it so let's do it. Nobody's doing anyone a favor, it's only 4:10 and i can't believe it's not later but that's okay because there are things here, ladies and gentlemen please say hello to our friend Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra, "Life's a gift. What you do with it is your business." said the 83 year-old chariot driver, light in men's room on LIRR so hideous that I couldn't bear to look in the mirror, (like some Viet Nam combat veterans rape and incest survivors and Holocaust survivors), longtime figurehead for a dope smoking blotter sucking dance-in-the-aisles sold-out hippie culture, Make all the noise you want to on the toilet.
