Say Goodnight Gracie. Goodnight George. Whoops. Sammy Davis Jr. word is that Sammy weighed less than his age which was 64 at the time of his death. No shit. Only the oldest skinniest corpses can pull that off. The heaviest part of his body was probably his glass eye which I hope some mortician's assistant had the good sense to remove as a keepsake. It'd be a waste to bury the motherfucker;
