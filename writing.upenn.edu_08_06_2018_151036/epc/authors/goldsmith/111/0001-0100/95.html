Betty Botter bought some butter but she said this butter's bitter. If I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter. But a bit of better butter will make my batter better. So she bought a bit of butter better than her bitter butter and she put it in her batter and it made her batter better. So 'twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter, drinking milk is like raping a man with a machine then strapping a woman to another machine and raping her with a gigantic dildo then shooting her up with drugs then when she gives birth steal her baby and sell it to a life of under-nourishment then coming back to the woman's house three times a day to pump her breasts dry and rape her again to start the process over, what really annoys me are digital clocks that go really slowly when you hold the button down. You know you're trying to adjust the time because the power went out or you're trying to set the alarm and they take forever just to change from one minute to the next. You find that you can go ten times faster just by hitting the button really fast. Why do clocks have the hold-down feature;
