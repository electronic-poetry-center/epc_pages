<P>
Dr. Johnson complain'd of Fleas to Mr. Mitchell of Brighthelmstone I remember &amp; the old Man with much affected Gravity -- said "Why Sir perhaps they are beneficial in emptying the Capillary Vessels &amp; Flea bite o' me may be as good as Phlebotomy in such Cases." Johnson was very ill pleas'd &amp; disliked Mitchell ever after, my only nourishment consists of food that is white: eggs sugar shredded bones the fat of dead animals veal salt coconuts chicken cooked in white water mouldy fruit rice turnips sausages in camphor pastry cheese (white varieties) cotton salad and certain kinds of fish (without their skin). I boil my wine and drink it cold mixed with the juice of the fuchsia, "stand up straight follow directions and you'll be fine." well ... well ... fine this muthafucker. i've sat and listened long enough i'm sick of being oppressed i'm sick of watching others be oppressed my feelings can only be expressed in rage i've learned all i need to know about what society stands for and i'm sick of it! ... hmm ... &#176;think i'll get a nose ring ... and a tattoo ... yeah, well the trick is to balance your inner inner cerebral whirl on the brink of the utmost ultimate hazy high while downing a fifth ducking to avoid that mind-worm and trying to find that mushroom or other tab of the really fucked up stuff and your third eye is screammmming and your head is hammmmering and when you wake up in de-tox the whole thing is over;
