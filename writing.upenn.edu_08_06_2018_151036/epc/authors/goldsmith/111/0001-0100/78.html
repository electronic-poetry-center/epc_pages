Avoid those run-on sentences that just go on and on and on they never stop they just keep rambling and you really wish the person would just shut up but no they just keep going they're worse than the Energizer Bunny they babble incessantly and these sentences they just never stop they go on forever, first take: you enter a quiet out-of-the-way drugstore that has a display of walkers and bedpans in the window.

Finally it all collapsed in gunfire and he ended up in the hospital recovering but having lost the use of his legs. "It's funny" he said. "Now that I'm out of the business nobody calls me anymore", water balloons: yeah plain water balloons really belong to the grade-schoolers and the fraternity types with balloon launchers but how about putting about a tablespoon of Rit dye in the balloon before you fill it? Looks really nice on stucco or on white cinderblock where it gets a chance to soak in for a few hours, words you will not find in the Bible: dick scrub felch fisting toenail crank slick 50 winona hemi MC5 abortion is murder meat is murder christ was a chump xian sassy suckle squeal grrrls pie hole the virgin mary wasn't one blowjob smashing pumpkins disney slurp aardvark godzilla bossa nova;
