Hey kitty! You're like the queen of the ball the hot chick on the dance floor the girl in the spotlight. How do you do that? But stop drinking so much coffee or Pepsi or whatever it is that you do for all them bursts of energy cuz you might O.D. and we wouldn't want that. We love you just the way you are, if you would open a drawer very slowly you will notice that the light goes into the drawer. You cannot see the dark leave the drawer. Continue to open the drawer and light will continue to enter the drawer however you will not see any dark leave the drawer;
