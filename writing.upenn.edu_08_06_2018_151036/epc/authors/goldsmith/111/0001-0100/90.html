<P>
In reality I must admit that I have never struck a woman (even a piggy) and probably never would. The idea however of grinding your snout into a box of Ding-Dongs smearing it all over your piggy face and riding you around the room degrading you and slapping your big-ass meaty cheeks is <I>such</I> an arousing one however..., with? Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Bindad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Mindbad the Mailer and Henbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer, You have to notice sooner or later that there's no future in anything aside from spiritual development. You can get up to Vice President and die or get thrown out and die. I did that. I went through a whole company up to the top and what do you do after that? Whether it's your house or your wife or your kids -- in anything there is no future;
