Am I bitter?, I think that at this point there is enough appropriated language. It is now time to use another, I wonder how many punks will no longer be punks after they work for IBM or whatever, I would like to create an art in which there is no possibility of either fear or failure, I'll have to stay at home so I called you on the phone cause I'm stuck here on the throne with diarrhea, I've been here before and I come here often to think and I regret that I haven't jumped earlier, If you were to describe yourself as a fruit would you be a mango a cherry or a banana?, imagine going through life trying to empty yourself of all previously acquired ideas, in fact we children of the '70s are not going to bring the '50s back to America, it felt like an aftershock from three double cappuccinos with a candy bar and a Jolt soda, it sucks when you call a cab and they say "It'll be there in ten minutes" and it takes more than an hour, it was a singles bar a Tuesday night the moon was dim the band was tight they did the bump together, it was extremely interesting watching him draw for a while and then begin to smell the paper, It's only a year and after a year I'm sure that my work in English will be different -- freer?, John Bloor who mistook a tube of superglue for his hemorrhoid cream and glued his buttocks together, Kiss was the Seventies act that most inspired adolescents to defy their parents and play guitar, look to the sky for your savior he won't save ya he didn't save your forefathers why bother brothers, Mann on Wagner: most sensational self-portrayal and self-criticism of German character, men in lime-green corduroys with little orange elephants bray as their wives buy overpriced scrimshaw, men who abuse have either been abused or have witnessed abuse so you're a potential abuser, more perfect than the Greek more copious than the Latin and more exquisitely refined than either, most language is spoken language and most words once they are uttered vanish forever into the air, my personal favorite bar soap at the moment -- a nicely neutral odor hella-lather, my work is generally something you cannot memorize although parts of it might resound in your, neat ideas for chemical mixes that will turn my blood green or my piss into a red powder, never seen a live one before concentrated orange jews^H^H^Huice I put up in my freezer, not anger but "divine melancholy" was responsible for my unconventional behavior, "Not that we didn't have affairs" he admitted with a smile at my raised eyebrows.
