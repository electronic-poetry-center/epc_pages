<P>
I told him of my plans to travel for a month in India. I told him that I planned to do a long piece in Sanskrit a language which I neither speak nor write. He said: I don't know. Why don't you do a different type of writing when you are there -- write something that will really "mean something" to you. That way you will be able to look back on your trip and really remember, Why not get together with some friends soon and say NO?! Say no to the draft or work or religion or authority figures or school say no to television patriotism political ideologies any of the thousand and one ways in which this society keeps you from realizing your own needs and desires. You'll find the more you do it the more;
