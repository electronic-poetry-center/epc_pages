Hi this is a picture of me. I look like a schmuck huh? We got these pictures for free because they took pictures of my mom and screwed up so they took pictures of me for free. Look at my hair. What the hell? Why do I have the little thing coming off my hairline that "widow's peak?" Am I Dracula or what? Oh well. Geez! I'm uglier than a goat's ass. I'm a nipple smack. Do I look like Curious George? That's what my brother says. Please write me back. I never get mail anymore;
