What is your true assessment of the future? Next we should talk about titty-bars. Am I to take it that Non-conformisim is not tolerated here? No-one is obliged to answer anybody else's questions. No-one is obliged to share any personal details they don't want to share. Don't people volunteer enough juicy stuff to satisfy you? Why be so damned prying about one person in particular? Besides prying is hardly non-conformity. It's as American as Budweiser.
