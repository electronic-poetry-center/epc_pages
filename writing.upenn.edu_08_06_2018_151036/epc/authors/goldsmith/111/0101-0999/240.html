And slowly this is drawing to a conclusion. Really the whole idea was to avoid taste and in doing so avoid things like "writer's block." However as the project has dragged on such things have surfaced and have become whether I like it or not part and parcel of the work. There is a great deal of contrivance that has found its way into the work particularly in the later chapters. The idea of editing is an absurd one because the initial tenets said that things would simply accumulate and in the end learn to live together -- an additive process a building process rather than one of refining whittling honing. Hence there is a great deal of self-conscious "curating" as I strive to reach my goal. Concerns that I'd generally tend to describe as conservative -- flow texture variety -- continue to creep in much to my dismay. Dismay over losing control. But wasn't the point in the first place to lose control? Whether, vem sombra vem e consuma esta sombra Vem sombra sombra vem e esta consuma Vem sombra vem e consuma esta sombra Vem vem sombra e consuma esta sombra Vem vem e sombra consuma esta sombra Vem consuma e vem sombra esta sombra E vem sombra vem esta sombra consuma E vem vem sombra consuma esta sombra E vem sombra vem consuma esta sombra Vem e vem esta sombra consuma sombra Esta sombra vem e consuma sombra vem E sombra vem consuma sombra vem esta Sombra consuma e vem esta sombra vem Consuma e vem sombra vem esta sombra Vem consuma sombra e vem esta sombra Vem e consuma sombra vem esta sombra Sombra sombra vem vem e esta consuma Vem sombra consuma e vem esta sombra Vem sombra vem e consuma esta sombra Vem sombra vem e consuma esta sombra;
