<P>
Go to a place where there are white elephants. Bring with you a muffin (with raisins). Climb a tree. When the white elephant is close drop the muffin (with raisins) in front of it. The white elephant will be happy and eat the muffin (with raisins). White elephants like muffins (with raisins). Repeat this procedure for five days in a row. After the fifth day the white elephant will be used to its daily muffin(with raisins). The sixth day you climb the tree bring with you a muffin without raisins. Drop the muffin as usual. When the white elephant finds out that the muffin lacks raisins it will darken in anger, "Over the years there have been a number of commercials in which the music sounds like Philip Glass" said Joe Wheeler the composer's manager. "And in 9 out of 10 cases it's not. And while flattering to a point it can become a distortion of a composer's music and philosophy." Mr. Wheeler points out however that Mr. Glass does not object in principle to his work being used in commercials. He has written a simple theme that will be included on an electronic chip in a new line of Swatch watches. He has also written music for MCI and Christian Dior, why would some dumb motherfucker who lives on the other side of the country want to make fun of my cracks when his aren't even funny? The guy's never met me before what a freak. If his cracks were funny I'd have no problem with it but they're not. Mine are 5 times funnier than his stupid feeble attempts to be funny. He just wants to be popular and be the one to put someone down. What a fucking nerd. Chris dickhead Pike don't own Mush Slap does. And they put in whoever they want to. Why don't you close your legs Chris dickhead Pike because it smells like a dead pike. White trash. Because you got a pussy down there;
