<P>
I'm running out of procrastination techniques. Anyone have any suggestions? Keep a messy room with magazines and papers all over the floor. When you feel you are on the verge of working swear to yourself you won't do a like lick of it until you clean your room. Then as you're cleaning your room don't forget to become attracted and engrossed by every other article you come across in the mags and papers strewn on your floor. Guaranteed to take hours!;
