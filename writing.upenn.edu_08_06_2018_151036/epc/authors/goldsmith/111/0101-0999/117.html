<P>
One night we were walking our dog. As we passed in front of a fancy restaurant Cheryl shrieked "There's Linda Evangelista!" Suddenly the dog who was off the leash bolted away from us and went trotting up to Linda who proceeded to bend down and pet her. We were too starstruck to say a word and soon enough Linda was whisked away by a bodyguard and Babette returned to us. Cheryl turned and looked at me and said with all seriousness "I'll never wash that boxer";
