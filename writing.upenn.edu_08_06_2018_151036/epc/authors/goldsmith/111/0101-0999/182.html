Of course the differences between people aren't nearly as puzzling as the veritable plethora of inconsistencies that are observably demonstrated by any given individual person. Take for example the guy (and most of us know at least one of this ilk) who daily spends hour upon painstaking hour washing drying waxing buffing and vacuuming his car. Yet this same guy who by the light of the moon meticulously removes the dead bugs from his grille using Palmolive and Q-tips somehow fails to completely towel off his entire face after shaving in the morning and thus can regularly be seen walking around with small residual gobs of drying white foam caked behind his ears;
