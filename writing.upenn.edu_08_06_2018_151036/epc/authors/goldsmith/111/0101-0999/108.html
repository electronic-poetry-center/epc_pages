<P>
Gille a stock character in medieval plays usually a fool or country bumpkin. While hoeing he uncovers a mole and part of a seed. "Quickly finished I call to the limping man that." Every pitcher has a crack in it. If a philosophy or moral is intended it is very obscure. "Is it Chinese cabbage?" It is to be assumed that he refers to the seed he found. At any rate he love a life of pleasure, please explain to me the difference between "patronizing" a titty bar and working out at the health club an institution that thrives on lookism and people's insecurities about their appearance and extracts money from the unknowing victims of this cultural perversion and enslaves women in particular to relative starvation and attracts men who fantasize about meeting mindless "exercise" partners;
