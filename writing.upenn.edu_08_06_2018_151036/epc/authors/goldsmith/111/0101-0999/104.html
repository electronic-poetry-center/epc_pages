<P>
Seeing her despair I wrote her a note telling her that I thought that she should return to her more open-spirited work in the arts. I told her that I thought it was a good idea to get away from the fiercely competitive egotistic and money oriented artworld that she was so deeply invested in. It was taking her nowhere and I could see that the past fifteen years had devastated her, we went to visit him and then he came to New York to visit my studio. We looked at the encyclopedic artwork and he commented that he felt that this was something which I could work out of for years. I took what he had to say into consideration and finally came to the conclusion that although he might have been right after I was done with this work I'd never want to think about it anymore;
