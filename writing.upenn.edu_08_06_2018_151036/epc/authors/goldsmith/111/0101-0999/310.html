<P>
If a ram is a sheep and an ass is a donkey why is a ram in the ass a goose? If you placed a refrigerator in a climatically sealed room and left it running with the door open would the room get hotter or colder? Why are flamingos pink and their knees are on backwards? Could God create a rock so heavy that he himself could not lift it? If you put gum over your asshole and farted would it make a bubble? What's the shortest route around an island? If you are traveling at the speed of light and you turn your headlights on what happens? If you ate your own foot would you lose weight? Why do we park in driveways and drive on parkways? What is Braille for "Braille"? Have you ever thought of all the wholes there could be if people would just take the time to take the dirt out of them? Do babies think  that adults are cute? If cats and dog didn't have fur would we still pet them? If you unscrewed your bellybutton would your ass fall off? If you melt a pool full of dry ice can you swim in it without getting wet? If con is the opposite of pro is congress the opposite of progress? If Barbie is so popular why do you have to buy all of her friends? If you are standing directly on the line between two time zones is it 12:00 on one side and 1:00 on the other?;
