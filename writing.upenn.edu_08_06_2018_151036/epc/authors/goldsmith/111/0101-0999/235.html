It's easy to achieve a modicum of mastery in the simple style you now reject but the true bloom of that style comes only twenty or thirty years later but I suppose that right now you find it gratifying to revel in a freedom which you have come upon through theory and abstract thought. I wish you well though you know how much I hate such poetry. My true wish for you is that you return to your;
