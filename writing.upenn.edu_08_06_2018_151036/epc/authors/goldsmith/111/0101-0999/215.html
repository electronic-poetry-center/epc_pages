<P>
Take out a safe deposit box but preferably under an assumed name. One year's rental is not that expensive. Get some material which will begin to decompose preferably fish pack it and place in your box at the bank of your choice. When packaging remember that decomposing matter will expand at a slow rate so leave a little room in the box. Not only are banks prohibited by law from opening safe deposit boxes but how can you tell which box the smell is coming from? Well eventually they might discover it yet if they open your box before your rental runs out after one year one might even consider making a court case out of it. I mean your mother might have given you the fish before you left Chicago and you wanted to make sure it didn't get ripped off. Couple three "fish" boxes and who knows? The Mad Bomber;
