<P>
It was April 15 1993 and I was taking the cross-town bus to a birthday party for Boog on the West Side. A crazy lady was mumbling to herself in the seat across from me. She was going through her purse and finally pulled out a dollar bill and threw it on the floor. She got up and left at the next stop. Two elderly ladies who were sitting behind her were watching the proceedings carefully. One of them made sure that the crazy lady was off the bus looked around quickly and grabbed the dollar. She took it back to her friend. The two examined it closely and as she stuffed it into her purse she exclaimed "There's nothing wrong with this dollar!";
