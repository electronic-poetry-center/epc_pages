((((((((((((When will the world change instead of you. Well if we could get all the people in all the wars currently going on in the world to stop killing each other and get on the internet and write whatever they want to even if it doesn't make sense the world would change. Also if people who want the world to change would do something kind for someone -- some act of heroism -- the world would change. Many people change the world. Some people choose to change the world by obliterating as much as they can of it but other people rebuild it. It is relatively easy to sit and whine or to shoot something or someone or burn it but it takes a greater person to clean it up and start over)))))))));
