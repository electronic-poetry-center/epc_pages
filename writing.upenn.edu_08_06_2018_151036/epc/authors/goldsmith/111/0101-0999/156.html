At lunch the famous artist told me about his clinical depression. I told him that he seemed to be doing much better. "Well" he began "my doctor has prescribed Prozac." "Really?" I inquired. "Yes.

"But instead what happened was when I took it it made me ask myself 'Why would I want to be in a room full of people that intimidated me in the first place?'" he answered, I'm not what one would call an ambitious man who solicits.

Soliciting is one of the forms of need the consequence of a need. This doesn't exist for me because fundamentally I have gotten along fine without producing anything for a long time now.
