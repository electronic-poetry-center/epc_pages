<P>
He made me feel dirty. I didn't know what he was going to do to me. Even though now I'm safe I still worry all the time. I worry about being taken away. I worry that someone might hurt me. John Esposito should go to jail for as long as he can. If another little girl or boy were kidnapped or sexually abused I would advise them to talk to an adult or go to the police. They should talk to the police. They should talk about everything with their therapist if they have one. And they should try to be brave. I learned to be brave for being on my own. Now I feel safe with my foster family. Other people who made me feel safe were the District Attorney's office Mr. Catterson Mary Brumley the police friends and family. Katherine Katie Marie Beers;
