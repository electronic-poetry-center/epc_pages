We do not read the Bible -- but we do care for &amp; we do read the newspaper -- it is a bible which we read every morning &amp; every afternoon standing &amp; sitting -- riding &amp; walking -- it is a bible which lies on every table &amp; counter which every man carries in his pocket which the mail &amp; thousands of missionaries are continually dispersing -- it is the only book which America has printed and is Capable of exerting an almost inconceivable influence for good or bad. The editor is preacher whom you voluntarily support your tax is commonly one cent -- and it cost nothing for pew-hire;
