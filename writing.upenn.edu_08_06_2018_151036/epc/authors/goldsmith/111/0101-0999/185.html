<P>
You see I've been thinking about the suburbs and how much they disgust me. And how much you disgust me because 99% of you live in the American Wetdream that is the suburbs. But I don't hate you. And I don't despise you. But you do disgust me -- I resent you. And that's significantly different than common page-deep hate. If I hated you I'd avoid contact with you. I'd scream in agony every time I saw you every time I went to the mall for a pair of shoes. Every time I ate at a McDonalds. Every time I drove through the highbrow neighborhoods to get to the lowbrow track. I might even run over your dog one night. But I don't. But you do disgust me. And I do resent you. I resent breathing your same air;
