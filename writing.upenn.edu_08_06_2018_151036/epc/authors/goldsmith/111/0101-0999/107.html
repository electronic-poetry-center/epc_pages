<P>
At the farmer's market an old farmer was being interviewed by a film crew. He was asked about pesticides microwaves and finally about corporate involvement in the food industry. "They poison us" he said. "Where money is involved the food becomes spoiled." He was then asked what his view was of the future. He looked directly into the camera with a glint in his eye and said "Things will not remain this way forever";
