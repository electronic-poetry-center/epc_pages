My father is always looking for a solution to his many woes. This quest has led him down the New-Age path. This started many years ago when he and my mother returned from a week-long Silva Mind Control seminar in Texas. Upon returning he gathered us kids into the car and told us with pride that due to the methods he had learned in the past week we would never again have to stop for a traffic light -- he now could use his Mind Control to change the situation. Excitedly we climbed into the car. As we approached the first red light -- viol&agrave;! -- it went green. We applauded and as we came up to the next light it too turned green. Rather impressed we awaited the next light and as we approached it it was red and it stayed that way. We stopped for that light and it looked like we'd be stopping for red lights for the foreseeable future;
