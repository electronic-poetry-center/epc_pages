<P>
Sometimes I feel like everything I'm doing has been done before. It's just the particulars that have changed. It's the same project with new clothes on it. Strip it down and the structure is identical. Older artists complain that they have never received proper credit for the work that they have done. They claim that people have a memory that doesn't go back any longer than oh say five years. And then I begin to think that we are progressing in an ever-upward spiral -- passing over and over the same points just another level or two higher;
