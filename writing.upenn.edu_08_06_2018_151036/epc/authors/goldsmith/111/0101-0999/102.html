<P>
Every day Mr. Yerman hand copies the Torah letter by letter with a turkey quill. While he slowly works he prays. Before returning to his easel Mr. Yerman recalled how he was aghast when he and his wife saw a television commercial for a portable copier and fax machine. "I thought it was frightening" he said. "My wife said 'Of course you find it frightening. You write with a feather'", the kids. The parents. The dogs and cats. The cars. The fucking MTV PSA's to save the Earth by separating your newspapers. Know what? I throw my bottles cans and newspapers in with my fucking trash. And that's just the beginning baby. I'm ending the world. Here and now. I'm ushering in the apocalypse with my garbage can and I could give a fuck which suburb is the first to go. You spend 18 years;
