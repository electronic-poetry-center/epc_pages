<font size=2 color=3963A5>by A.S. Bessa</font></font>
<BR><BR>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">A.S. Bessa: I have recently read
a book on how Mallarm&eacute; would rework his prose poems on
the occasion of each new printing of them, and one prominent aspect
was how he increasingly augmented the quantity of commas in each
paragraph, as a way to slow down the reading act. That reminded
me of your drawings about punctuation which is an aspect of language
that we tend to overlook.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Kenneth Goldsmith: The fact that commas
slow down the act of reading is very much in keeping with John
Cage when he quoted Norman O. Brown as saying that &quot;syntax
is the arrangement of the army&quot; and Thoreau's idea that &quot;when
he heard a sentence he heard feet marching.&quot; Cage felt that
the function of syntax was that of a regulatory body-language's
policeman-and as an anarchist, was uninterested in those types
of order and restraint. The drawings to which you're referring
come directly from a Cage piece &quot;Writing Through Finnegans
Wake for the Second Time&quot; published in Empty Words (Wesleyan
University Press, 1981). In the piece, he creates a typical Cageian
mesostic write-through of Finnegans Wake yet he does something
that, to my knowledge, he only did once: he scatted the text's
syntax all over the page as dictated by chance operations. I was
struck by the beauty of that piece and was shocked that neither
Cage nor anyone else ever followed the idea to its logical conclusion-or
illogical conclusion as the case may be-by removing language altogether
and allowing the syntax to play freely. I tend to think of the
pieces as syntax on holiday.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: Another analogy would be to make
a comparison with traffic signs, and in the case of your drawings
it's as if the city had disappeared and only the signage persisted.
I am also struck by the randomness in them, although I am sure
they are very precise. Your work has always had a very brainy
finish to them, but at first glance, these drawings seem more
abstract and intuitive.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: All my work has a brainy finish to
it, though just below the surface, it's all intuitive, abstract
and poetic. The problem is that most people in the art world refuse
to go below an object's visual surface and thus never get past
an initial impression of what they're seeing. But the dynamic
that I'm invoking is completely intentional and functions to turn
the paradigm of text art on its ear. By employing text art's conventions-which
I'm quite fond of--it's a perfectly rigorous way of subverting
them. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">I figure that I lose over half the
gallery audience by working with text. Many people walk into a
gallery and just turn around because they &quot;don't read&quot;
their art. In addition, most people feel that with text-based
work, they have to read the entire thing, start to finish. My
work functions differently in that it is impossible to read conventionally
start to finish; it works better as browsing, the way we read
a newspaper. Who reads a newspaper start to finish in that order?
We are already trained to skim-it's how we read today.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">The difference between one text artist
and another should be in the way their work reads, not in the
way it looks. An occupational hazard of being a text-based artist
is that your work is going to look like everyone else's! It's
something that one acknowledges when they devote themselves to
working exclusively with text; after all, there are only 26 visual
forms your work can take. You consciously accept the medium's
limitation-it's a radical stance to take in an art world obsessed
with individuality and differentiation. And the strange thing
is that writers don't seem to have this problem: Open any book
to page 50 and it's pretty much going to look the same as page
50 of any other book. Once again, the question writers ask themselves
is: How does it read? I think that's a question that more text-based
artists need to be asking themselves. Once you enter into this
way of thinking, you realize that text-based art is a wonderfully
open field.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: Audiences want to be visually entertained-they
shy away from anything that will ask more work on their part.
Many people will not read works like Ulysses or Finnegans Wake
because they think of them as unreadable, thus missing all the
wonders of the text.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: <I>Finnegans Wake</I> is certainly beyond
the novel. Joyce wrote a book that, in no way, could ever have
been mistaken for a novel: It's unnameable, unknowable and uncategorizable.
To me, Finnegans Wake is as much an object as it is a book, something
to be looked at as much as it is to be read. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">When I wrote my 600 page <I>No. 111 2.7.93-10.20.96</I>,
I wanted to create an object that couldn't be named, categorized
or identified. I looked on my bookshelf and saw that any reference
book worth its salt was at least 600 pages. Hence, I stopped writing
my book when I hit 600 pages. In the end, <I>No. 111</I> can never be
mistaken for a novel or a book of poetry. To this day, it remains
unnameable. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In addition, in the spirit of <I>Finnegans
Wake</I>, I wanted to write a book so large and complex, that I could
open it at any time and be surprised. However, after having spent
over four years working on it, I found that I ended up knowing
every word in the book. Only recently-it's been two years since
publication-have I begun not to know it anymore. And now, every
once in a while, I can pick up the book and be surprised!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: What is striking about</I> No. 111
2.7.93-10.20.96<I> is its encyclopedic character, which one associates
with Joyce or Pound, but in your case the choices seem more aleatory.
The attempt to sum up all books in one is present in Joyce and
Pound but their processes were highly selective--perhaps we can
even call them elitist--whereas yours is more democratic (for
lack of a better word). Even the title of your book has a more
detached tone to it. What your process was like in writing </I>No.
111 2.7.93-10.20.96<I>?</I><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: It was both an aleatory and a highly
structured process. I am a collector; as a writer, I am a collector
of language. For three and a half years, during the time in which
I wrote <I>No. 111</I>, I collected words and phrases that ended in sounds
relating to the &quot;schwa&quot;: are, ah, air, ear, uh, and
so on. I collected these sounds from conversations, the newspaper,
television, books-anywhere that there was language. I was constantly
scribbling down things or speaking into a tape recorder. At the
end of each day I would bring my harvest of language home and
dump it into a word processing program, where I would hand-count
the number of syllables in each phrase (there are no computer
programs that can accurately count syllables). It was in this
way that the book became structured: alphabetically and syllabically.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: A few years ago I saw a panel discussion
led by Jerry Saltz at the Drawing Center in which you participated,
and I had this image of you as a person that does not throw anything
out. That was the first time I saw your work, and I had the feeling
that you were doing a poetic inventory of sorts. The &quot;found
poetry&quot; section on UbuWeb is another fascinating example
of your collecting drive. Do you agree with Geoffrey Young when
he calls you a &quot;taxonomist of the language environment?<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: Yes, but I'm not so much a namer as
I am an organizer of language. In Ron Silliman's <I>The New Sentence</I>,
he posits the idea of language becoming commodified and privatized
when used in &quot;public&quot; places such as road signs or advertisements.
In Silliman, there's a sense of regret and loss. While I can sympathize,
my generation doesn't see it as a problem thanks to having come
of age with ideas such as appropriation and sampling as part of
the lingua franca. On the contrary, the more public and commercial
language becomes, the more available it is to re-employ and re-purpose
with the life that was drained from it. There's so much great
language out there for the taking; if we open our eyes and ears
to it, we'll find it in abundance. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">I have often worked with concretizing
the ephemeral, making the invisible visible, finding out what
language weighs. In 1996, I did a piece called <I>Soliloquy</I> where
I tape recorded and transcribed every word I spoke for a week
from the moment I woke up on Monday morning until the moment I
went to sleep Sunday night. The tag line for the piece was &quot;
If every word spoken in New York City daily were somehow to materialize
as a snowflake, each day there would be a blizzard.&quot; The
book was 350 pages long and the language just fell together. Marshall
McLuhan talked about the creative process as requiring nothing
more than the &quot;brushing&quot; together of two chunks of content;
the variety of results can be shocking. I wasn't trained as a
writer, yet I am now one. I was trained as a sculptor and as a
result, have a strong urge to make language physical.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In the past, I did not edit (<I>No. 111</I>
and <I>Soliloquy</I>); I simply accumulated. But my recent project, <I>Fidget</I>-every
move my body made on Bloomsday 1997-was heavily edited. The methodology
was the same, but the parameters slightly shifted. As a result,
editing was part of the process or machine and, for this project,
was permitted.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In my life I'm also a collector. I'm
a DJ on WFMU and have several thousand LPs and CDs. I've also
been collecting found and insane poetry off the streets of New
York City for the past fifteen years, the best of which is housed
on <A HREF="http://www.ubu.com" TARGET="new">UbuWeb</A>. There's so much language in this city that one could
spend their entire life making different sorts of collections
of language that is here. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: Heidegger wrote on the issue of
using language for practical purposes which he was, of course,
against. But I do agree with you about the possibilities in commercial
language, or language as commodity. It is a matter of trusting
the power of language to renew itself, always creating new words
and syntax.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: Yes, over the past decade we've seen
language renewing itself at a remarkable rate. For example, compound
words forming URLs have become common parlance (my favorite is
Modell's: gottagotomos.com: It's something right out of <I>Finnegans
Wake</I>). I first noticed this tendency in the early 90s when rappers
started slamming words together to create compounds like &quot;funkdoobiest.&quot;
Around the the same time there was rap movement sometimes known
as The Daisy Age (A Tribe Called Quest, Jungle Brothers) which
incorporated modernist collage and noise into the mixes. It was
as if they took classic musique concr&egrave;te and added beats
to it, not to mention radical Burroughs-esque cut-up and John
Oswald-like plunderphonic practices. It was an amazing confluence
as modernism and pop culture worked together to stretch and twist
the parameters of language. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: Even the concept of the &quot;book,&quot;
which we are all so fond of, has been blown up to accommodate
new necessities. The fact that you were trained as a sculptor,
for example, sets up an entirely new attitude towards the book.
<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: Actually, over the years, I've grown
less fond of the book and more devoted to the internet. I've come
to feel-and this is particular to literature and music-that if
it doesn't exist on the Internet, it doesn't exist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Now, having said that, I'm convinced
of the web's radical powers in those spheres. A few years ago,
a French filmmaker said to me &quot;in a time of pluralist practice,
the issue is not 'make it new' but the new paradigm concerns methods
of distribution.&quot; How you distribute it counts as much as
how you make it. This has radical implications for those arts
which have functioned on what is basically a gift economy. Take
poetry, for example: Hardly anybody ever makes money from poetry.
When you get poetry books, they've usually been given to you by
their authors or you've bought them for a couple of bucks from
Small Press Distribution at little profit to the poets. Because
most poets are still under the illusion that there is a career
to be had from the production of paper books, they unnecessarily
saddle themselves with an old distribution system. Also, they
are at the mercy of publishers who have no money, but whom nonetheless
dangle the prospect of publication in front of the authors. As
a result, many friends of mine have literally waited years for
a book to appear that will ultimately have no distribution to
speak of. On the web, you can publish instantly, in full color
and have terrific global distribution at virtually no cost. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">UbuWeb is proof of this. In 1996,
I decided that I would put an obsession of mine up on the web.
I had been collecting concrete poetry books ever since I went
to visit the Ruth and Marvin Sackner Archive of Visual and Concrete
Poetry in Miami in the late 80s. Without permission, I started
scanning and posting my collection under the name UbuWeb. Three
years later, it has become the definitive collection of this work
on the web. Poets find their work on UbuWeb and instead of threatening
to sue me for using their work without permission or issuing a
&quot;cease and desist&quot; order, they thank me for taking an
interest in their work. It's a win-win situation: A dying art
form is given new life and artists whose work had been out of
circulation are thrilled to see their work &quot;in print&quot;
again. It's all thanks to a new system of distribution; again,
it's McLuhanesque-it's the medium here that is the real story,
not the &quot;content,&quot; (the &quot;content&quot; has always
been interesting and we need not worry about it-it takes care
of itself). In the words of John Perry Barlow, it's not wine in
new bottles, it's wine without the bottles.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: There are certainly a lot of possibilities
to explore on the internet and in this regard, UbuWeb is a model
to be followed. What I find most interesting is the fact that
it is an open book, so to speak, always under construction.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: I'm only interested in forms of art
that are &quot;open books&quot;; once we know a work, we are finished
with it. Take pop music, for example: we quickly learn not only
the songs on an album but the order in which they appear. As a
result, the experience is completely anticipatory. It's based
on memory and, in turn, on nostalgia. It cans the music and pins
it to a specific place and time, limiting our experience with
it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: Still the &quot;idea of the book&quot;
will persist for a long while, even if the internet succeeds in
replacing it, exploding it or erasing it. You, for instance, still
use the book format even though you acknowledge its limitations.
<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: This is a book, right? {{{ sigh }}}
Yes. I love the book. Deeply. I love language and in my time,
the book has been the vehicle that's delivered language most effectively
to me. However, there are now other means of linguistic transport
that are making the book format seem very limited. If we look
beyond the book, we'll find that language is the most plentiful
natural resource we produce/possess. And far from becoming a long-promised/threatened
predominantly visual culture, we still can't seem to debunk the
preeminence of words as a primary transport of ideas. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: I wonder whether with new technologies
of &quot;linguistic transport,&quot; as you say, notions such
as &quot;reading,&quot; &quot;writing,&quot; &quot;looking,&quot;
etc. will also be transformed, expanded. I'm really taken by the
fact that the internet brought about the performative aspect of
language to such a physical dimension-we need &quot;pass-words,&quot;
we click icons, we are transported to &quot;sites&quot; by clicking
on sensitive words, etc. At the same time, all aspects of language
have been completely transformed such as in &quot;gottagotomos.com,&quot;
or even in its simplest traces such as http, www, .com, etc.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">KG: Yes. It seems that with the examples
that you've brought up in regards to the internet and technology,
we've physicalized language to a new degree. I love the physicality
of language and I'm thrilled with a new technology that can make
language even more muscular, more opaque. The less transparent
language becomes on a regular basis, the more sensitized we become
to its formal and physical qualities. We start to pay attention
to the concreteness of language, instead of taking it for granted
as a commodity, a unique medium for exchange. Through this process,
language becomes more curious and valuable in and of itself. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">I have dealt with these issues over
the years by working in languages I don't know. I've worked in
Spanish, French, Greek, Polish, to name a few. I found that it
was a particularly effective way to could get past my likes and
dislikes-my tendency towards transparency, you might say-in using
language. When I work in languages that I don't know, I am able
to work with the words formally and concretely; I don't have to
worry about what they mean, only what they look like and maybe
sound like. And the great thing about language is that it will
always mean something, but in this instance, it's often not what
you intended. It's very liberating.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial"> I've have this fantasy of working
exclusively in languages I don't know for a long period of time,
say, 5 years. Imagine that-5 years of working with something you
don't understand a word of! This is one of the reasons I refuse
to learn another language: If I learn it, then I have no use for
it-artistically speaking-anymore!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">ASB: Are you preparing any new projects
as we speak (I mean, exchange e-mails)?<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">For several months now I have been
trying to organize a major project: a year-long version of <I>Soliloquy</I>.
It will be a documentation of every word that I speak for an entire
year-unedited. But it will differ from the first version of <I>Soliloquy</I>
in that it will take place live over the Internet. I'll be hooked
up to a wireless headset, which will cellularly beam my words
to a voice recognition system on a computer that will, in turn,
automatically churn my words into web pages. In short, anyone
anywhere will be able to see what I'm saying at any given moment
during the course of a year. Think of it as a text-based <I>Truman
Show</I>. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">But what I really care about is the
language itself and, in the end, I will have archived all the
text files and turned them into a 52 volume work-one book for
each week-with each book about 350 pages long (the length of the
printed edition of Soliloquy) giving me a total of approximately
18,000 pages. It'll literally be an encyclopedia, a reference
book of what one average person said for an entire year in the
early part of the 21st century. It'll not only make a great artwork,
but every library in the country will have to have a copy, due
to its sociological relevance. And best of all, it's a book that
will &quot;write&quot; itself. The new version of <I>Soliloquy</I> neatly
sums up my attitude toward language: language will flow and mold
into whatever form its poured-it's at once ephemeral and permanent,
concrete and digital.<BR>
