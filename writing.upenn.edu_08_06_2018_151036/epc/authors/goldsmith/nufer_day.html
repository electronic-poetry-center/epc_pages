 Everybody has a story to tell and anybody can write.  You have a unique
voice:  nobody else can write your story.  You and your voice and story
are important, even valuable.  Everybody else wants to know about you.
Follow a few simple exercises and get in touch with your creativity.
Follow a few simple tips and re-create your own story in the form

 With his new book, <i>Day</i>, Kenneth Goldsmith checks c) none of the above.
<i>Day</i>, just published by The Figures and laughably branded as Poetry, is
Goldsmith's answer to the creativity movement that would make "artists"
of us all.  In a self-confessed urge to rid himself of all creative
impulses, Goldsmith began to type the entire New York Times of Sept. 1,
2000.  836 pages later, we have <i>Day</i>.
<br><br>
 Goldsmith's label for this accomplishment as "uncreative writing" and
the back cover of the book explains that uncreativity is a
constraint-based process because writer must resist temptation to tamper
with the original.  After all the fuss our culture makes over creativity
and originality, Goldsmith can't resist questioning what all the fuss is
about.  Like his books, <i>No. 111</i>, which collects and sorts sounds and
phrases according to patterns, <i>Fidget</i>, which notes every move his body
makes in a day, and <i>Soliloquy</i>, which tape records every word he says in
a week, <i>Day</i> is a record; unlike the other works, it is a record of a
record:  a paper record of the paper of record.
<br><br>
 And, as with Goldsmith's other work, <i>Day</i> can pose an alternating
pattern of attraction/ repulsion.  First, the idea grabs you.  Then, you
get it (or don't) and the whole thing seems stupid.  But then, you start
reading, and find yourself reading more and more.  The obituary of a
gangster, the box scores of the Mets when they weren't lousy, the
typical news of a day when the news was merely typical, the ads, and the
movie reviews are not only interesting in themselves, but, thanks to
this project, poetically resonant in a way that exoticizes the mundane.
You jump around <i>Day</i> from one section to another, as if it's understood
that nobody would ever read such a thing straight through; then maybe
you put it down, intending to return or vowing to get on with your life.
Afterwards, other ideas spin off the original.
<br><br>
 For instance, in her review of Don DeLillo's <i>Cosmopolis</i> in the paper of
record, Michiko Kakutani reckoned that the 911 attacks had somehow made
DeLillo's fictional New York City irrelevant.  Not that other reviewers
would ever check the <i>NY Times</i> before they filed their own copy, but I
read other versions of the 9-11 relevancy test applied to <i>Cosmopolis</i> in
at least two other papers.  Then, along comes <i>Day</i>, set a full year
before (and therefore blissfully ignorant of) that day that has become
so, even if justifiably so, full of itself.
<br><br>
 More to the point, perhaps, <i>Day</i> makes me wonder what constitutes a
copy.  Can a book that repackages one issue of a daily newspaper be
properly defined as a copy of that original if it contains none of the
typesetting or formatting of the original?  Can a book that publishes
such a copy several months after the original appeared be a true copy of
the original if the original is a document that had to come out on the
day that it did?
<br><br>
What is the nature of the copy and of the original is, of course, one of
the major factors in deciding Fair Use under U.S. Copyright law.
Debatable as the relationship between the copy and the original may be,
nobody would argue that 750-book print run <i>Day</i> is a commercial vulture
of the original or that <i>Day</i> harms the market of the original (two other
factors), but a copyright chauvinist could seize upon the fourth factor
to argue that Goldsmith goes too far in how much he takes from the
original in order to make his copy.
<br><br>
Rather than the <i>Times</i> legal beagles, though, I wonder if the Times
critic crickets will make any noise about <i>Day</i>.  For all of the
creativity racket we hear from commercial presses (thanks, in no small
part, to their loud support in the <i>NYT Book Review</i>) and for all of the
creativity rackets we see advertising MFA programs, writers conferences,
how-to-write books, and vanity presses in literary magazines and daily
newspapers, much of the creative work we hear and see is monotonous
because the rules of the market don't allow much deviation in the kind
of creative output that's most suitable for mass production.
It is no accident that Goldsmith's targets in <i>Day</i> are not only the
cultural notion of creativity but also the chief shill of that notion,
the <i>NY Times</i>.  To be sure, the <i>Times</i> does occasionally (and perhaps more
than most daily newspapers) cover obscure, wacko, avant-whatever arts
and letters, but the bulk of coverage must go to commercially viable
creative products.  So what?  What's wrong with "creativity" anyway?
Well, the creativity I see Goldsmith attacking is essentially an
outgrowth of the imaginative position in the old imagination versus
invention debate.  Geniuses who spontaneously toss off their works
without questioning the forms and disciplines they work in are the
darlings of creativity.  These gurus of imaginative power not only make
good newspaper copy, they well serve the artistic categories and
definitions the system prefers to have in force.  Inventors who rip
stuff apart and start over from the ground up, who experiment with forms
and disciplines can also be good newspaper copy, but these oddballs of
inventive bent are prudently categorized as crackpots by a system they
do not respect and would eagerly destroy.  Creativity, then, is not an
activity likely to produce art, but the code word for a means of
production that begins with a dream of self-fulfillment and ends with
the maxim that nothing happens until somebody sells something.
