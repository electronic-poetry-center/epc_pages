Kenneth Goldsmith understands language as threefold: sound, sight
and sense (Pound's melopoeia, phanopoeia, logopoeia). In his text
art, he becomes a curler and counter of syllables, an arranger
and recorder of the word hoard. Via various formal constraints,
Goldsmith taxonomizes the language environment. Propelled by a
kind of polyglot desire, his texts pop with acronyms, buzz phrases,
people's names, Latin, French, advertising jingles, high-minded
poetry, banal newspeak. With a sculptor's feel for the materiality
of words (Goldsmith graduated from the Rhode Island School of
Design with a B.A. in sculpture, 1984), he slots his selections
into triphammer staccato densities almost as if they were carved
in stone.<BR>

<P>
&quot;No. 105&quot; is Goldsmith's longest work to date. Made
up of six columns of writing, each seven feet tall, the columns
are silkscreened onto rag paper, two to a panel, then framed.
These leaning towers of columnar language, justified and legible
from across the room, invite scanning, but they invite a paradox
into the work, as well. If the writing is the central content
of the work, as Goldsmith insists it is, it gets sacrificed in
a gallery context where few have the time or literary inclination
to stop and read a text as long as this one. Quick visual scanning
is the norm in galleries, where the fact that it is a text piece,
albeit attractively presented in a Minimalist inspired geometrical
fashion, is somehow more important than the cumulative content
of the writing itself. As a result of this dilemma, and as a way
of giving his work a life outside the expensive assumptions of
the art world and the unique object, Goldsmith, as an experiment,
has transformed &quot;No. 105&quot; into chapbook format (51/:
x 8l/2'') in an edition of 50 copies, thus freeing the text to
circulate and be read in private, as a literary document.<BR>

<P>
And it is a pleasure to announce that &quot;No. 105&quot; is a
reading experience of a new and refreshing kind. Adopting formal
constraints (Goldsmith could almost be a member of Oulipo, so
natural is it for him to place organizational limits to his text
production), the artist has used aural, alphabetical and numerical
systems to &quot;construct&quot; his text, harnessing its disparate
elements into blocks that grow in phrasal length from very short
(single syllable) to polysyllabic strings of semantic content,
each element in the mix obliged by his initial constraint to end
rhyme with the sound of the &quot;e.&quot; Got it? No, Gotti.
<BR>

<P>
The alphabetical device is this: each entry, separated by a comma,
is placed in alphabetical order so that &quot;beauty&quot; comes
before &quot;bitchy&quot; and &quot;complicity&quot; is placed
before &quot;daddy did me.&quot; At the end of any alphabetical
run the careful reader will notice a semi-colon. After this semi-colon,
a new grab-bag of entries, each with the same number of syllables,
will unfold, alphabetically again, and run their course. With
each new progression through the alphabet, the artist adds a syllable
to the length of any phrase. In this addictive process, Goldsmith
plays the role of taxonomist, distributing his mostly &quot;found&quot;
phrases in their appropriate place in the count.<BR>

<P>
And strangely enough, what his ordering systems generate, rather
than a too-confining set of strictures, is a nearly chance-inspired
freedom. Unpredictable juxtapositions send their probes into the
reader's mind for fresh associations. Like a Picasso still life,
Goldsmith's poems are made out of common verbal objects, but placed
together on the same &quot;table top,&quot; they trigger intricate
pleasures. With so much found language cobbled together in suddenly
&quot;orderly&quot; ways, it seems as if the verbal/sign-saturated
landscape in which our culture lives is being played back at us
in decontextualized bytes by an anonymous homogenizing machine.
But in fact these selections very much bear the stamp of their
maker's hand. They are Goldsmith's. His gatherings have a way
of preserving memory without imposing a particular story for that
memory, and in this he bears a filial relation to Ron Silliman.
Words accumulate, and in their precision sprawl we can see our
world, ourselves in its midst.<BR>

<P>
Connected to aspects of Fluxus, to Concrete poetry, and to experimental
writing in the computer age, Goldsmith's text art intersects with
today's culture on many fronts. At the center of his &quot;editing&quot;
terminal, the place from which his New York ear makes its choices,
imagine a socially alert, pop-drenched, rap-conscious scopophilic
downtown art paladin, filtering a generation's legibility through
its sensorium.
