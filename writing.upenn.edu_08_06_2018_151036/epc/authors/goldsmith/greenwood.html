Few living American poets have 
so thoroughly absorbed, and cleverly responded to, the avant-garde traditions 
in visual art and poetry - including 
<B>Dada</B>, <B>Futurism</B>, <B>Concretism</B>, 
<B>Fluxus</B>, and Conceptual Art - as Kenneth Goldsmith. With influences 
ranging from John Cage and Andy Warhol to contemporary hip hop and internet 
artists, Goldsmith has pushed the limits of late twentieth century poetics 
to both reinvigorate and pioneer aspects of visual poetry, sound poetry, 
the list poem, and digital poetics. If it is true, as Brion Gysin once 
remarked, that innovations in writing lag 50 years behind those of visual 
art, Goldsmith has steadfastly worked to bring the form up to date with 
the accomplishments of conceptual and performance art.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Goldsmith was born in Freeport, 
New York, to a family employed in the garment industry. He attended 
various schools in Long Island and Port Washington before receiving 
a BFA in Sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1984. Since 
then he has had a successful career as a visual artist and creator of 
textual objects, as well as being a DJ for the alternative radio station, 
WFMU (91.1, New York), and the original editor and compiler of the extensive 
online archive of  avant-garde poetries, Ubu Web &lt;www.ubu.com&gt;. 
Goldsmith lives in New York City with artist Cheryl Donegan and their 
son Finnegan.&nbsp;</P>
<P>As might be expected from his 
training, Goldsmith's initial artistic productions were sculptural, 
carved book-objects bearing ironic titles or concepts (for example, 
a 300 pound facsimile of Abbie Hoffman's 
<I>Steal This Book</I>). However, when these enterprises proved too 
labor-intensive for Goldsmith's increasingly linguistically-informed 
creativity he decided to devote himself to pure text-art. Personal contact 
with <B>Marvin Sackner</B>, and a visit to his collection of Visual 
Poetry in Florida, consolidated Goldsmith's knowledge of the international 
Concrete Poetry movement and the realization of the difficulty of finding 
visual and sound poetry in libraries or bookstores led to his desire 
to create the Ubu Web in order to increase awareness, and distribution, 
of experimental writing. &nbsp;</P>
<P><I>73 Poems</I> (1993) is Goldsmith's 
first extended exploration of visual poetry in a mass- produced book 
form. It contains a series of 79 textual overlays (the title is an allusion 
to <B>e.e. cummings</B>'s 1963 poetry collection - acknowledging his 
presence as the first major American visual poet) in which groupings 
of words are printed in bold text, with the same words then reproduced 
in a poem immediately following in a lighter text with a new word cluster 
imposed on top of it in bold. The effect is one of a palimpsest, with 
new associations being created through the simultaneous reproduction 
of two discrete poems, but it also provides a sense of continuity between 
each page. As the poems appear to expand and contract, moving to a minimalist 
arrangement of numbers and individual letters, before blossoming again 
to fully recognizable words, <I>73 Poems</I> is one of the few visual 
poetry sequences (along with <B>Emmett Williams</B>'s 
<I>Sweethearts</I> and Tom Phillips's 
<I>A Humument</I>) to engage with narrative progression. The choice 
of words for the poems also anticipates Goldsmith's later work in that 
it incorporates both "high" and "low" culture with quotations from 
<B>T.S. Eliot</B> found alongside those of Bob Dylan or The Rolling 
Stones, as well as Goldsmith's characteristic attraction to quotidian 
phrases and end-rhyme (ex. "Gain Weight/ Jailbait/ Soul Mate/ Hesitate/ 
Penetrate/ Watergate" [7]). The book includes a CD recording of Joan 
La Barbara's vocal interpretation of these pieces - making these poems 
a valuable contribution to the history of sound poetry scores. A series 
of stenciled textual overlays, similar to those of 
<I>73 Poems,</I> serve as illustrations for 
<B>Bruce Andrews</B>'s poetry collection 
<I>Tizzy Boost</I> (1993).&nbsp;</P>
<P>The chapbook 
<I>Gertrude Stein on Punctuation</I> (1999) reproduces an excerpt from 
<B>Stein</B>'s famous lecture "Poetry and Grammar" (1935) in which she 
provides a rationale for the use of certain forms of punctuation over 
others. This is followed by a series of three pages which consist solely 
of the punctuation marks taken from Stein's essay and arranged by Goldsmith. 
The free-play of syntax across the white page is visually-pleasing concrete 
poetry, but also foregrounds that which often goes unnoticed: that punctuation 
signifies, but is viewed as having low connotative value.&nbsp;</P>
<P>While 
<I>Gertrude Stein on Punctuation</I> may mark the end of Goldsmith's 
explicit investigation of visual poetry, it does lead directly into 
his work with found material. As one of the tenets of concrete poetry 
was the awareness of the physicality of language - that words could 
be used as "concrete" objects in the construction of poems - so too, 
in collecting and listing words on the basis of their sonic properties, 
particularly end-rhyme and syllabic-count, over (but not to the elimination 
of) their semantic meaning, Goldsmith privileges the materiality of 
language.&nbsp;</P>
<P>For example, in 
<I>No.105</I> (1992) Goldsmith collects, in a travesty of the rhyming 
dictionary, a series of words and phrases ending with the "ee" sound 
and lists them in alphabetical order by syllable count. However, whereas 
a classical guidebook's diction is derived from the standard corpus, 
with <I>No.105</I> Goldsmith collects the slang, the colloquialisms, 
and vulgarity of the late 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, as in "Frisbee, fuck 
me, funky, geegee, germ-free, goatee, gnarly!, grody!, Gucci, H.D." 
(1). This practice is continued with 
<I>No.109 2.7.93-12.15.93</I> (1993) where the same process is applied 
to words ending in the "schwa" sound (such as, "ar" and "ah").&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yet both of these publications 
are mere groundwork for Goldsmith's magnum opus 
<I>No.111 2.7.93-10.20.96</I> (1997), which follows 
<I>No.109</I> in collecting phrases ending in "r" sounds, but in this 
instance over a three year period, resulting in over 600 pages of text. 
Like his previous work in word collection, 
<I>No.111</I> begins with single syllable words, and increases by one 
syllable in each section, until it reaches a conclusion of 7,228 syllables. 
As in the poetry of Andrews, <I>No.111</I> excels at startling juxtapositions 
of obscenity, pop cultural references, idiosyncratic slang, and generational 
buzzwords. Amazingly comprehensive and wide-ranging in its references 
(including the just-emerging internet culture and its lingo) 
<I>No.111</I> is - if we are to use such Poundian definitions as being 
the "tale of the tribe" or "a poem containing history" - the last significant 
epic poem of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Goldsmith's lifelong fascination 
with music (both popular and avant-garde), facilitated in part by his 
job as a radio DJ and music critic, is represented in 
<I>6799</I> (2000) and <I>Head Citations </I>
(2002). In the former, Goldsmith simply lists, in alphabetical order, 
his LP and CD collection, drawing attention to the fact that his obsessive 
collecting tendencies are not restricted to language, as well to as 
issues of consumerism (the book is 92 pages long) and the occasional 
beauty of album titles and of contemporary rock group names. With 
<I>Head Citations</I>, however, Goldsmith is much more playful, presenting 
800 misheard pop song lyrics (the title, for example, is a misreading 
of the Beach Boys hit "Good Vibrations"). While not a significantly 
original idea, it is in keeping with the poet's interests in exploring 
the intersections of the aural and the oral.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The idea of collecting the 
quotidian takes a turn toward the personal with 
<I>Fidget</I> (2000), a transcript of the poet's every physical gesture 
taken over a 13 hour period. The fact that Goldsmith chooses Bloomsday 
(June 16<SUP>th</SUP>) 1997 to conduct this experiment suggests that 
he is engaging with James Joyce's attention to the minutae of daily 
life (and Goldsmith does follow some Bloomsian paths, masturbating, 
having breakfast, and walking along the beach) yet 
<I>Fidget </I>seems more an act of poetic defamiliarization, where common 
activities are rendered almost unrecognizable by the spartan text (for 
example, drinking coffee becomes: "Arm lifts. Swallow. Arm drops. Swallow. 
Arm lifts. Arm drops. Eyes move to left." [19]).&nbsp;</P>
<P>A logical successor to 
<I>Fidget</I>, where the individual's physicality becomes verbalized, 
<I>Soliloquy</I> (2001) captures all nuances idiosyncratic speech. Here, 
Goldsmith seems to expand upon Warhol's 
<I>A: A Novel </I>(1968)<I> -</I> in which the pop artist records and 
transcribes a friend's monologue for 24 hours - in that Goldsmith records 
his every utterance over an entire week. As with his work in concrete 
poetry, <I>Soliloquy</I> transforms spoken language into physical material. 
Designed to investigate how much a person speaks in an average week, 
the answer is 500 pages, or about 5 pounds.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Goldsmith's current textual 
practice involves exercises in "uncreativity." In 
<I>Day </I>(2003), the poet retypes the Friday, September 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 
2000 issue of the <I>New York Times</I>, from left to right, ignoring 
distinctions between articles and advertisements, stock quotes and editorials. 
Reproduced in a single consistent font, the published text is an 836 
page folio-sized tome, again demonstrating the physicality of language 
and the actual weight of linguistic material that most view as disposable. 
Although the gesture is perhaps more enjoyable as a concept than as 
a reading experience, the collection does provide numerous pleasures 
resulting from incongruous verbal juxtapositions and from the conflation 
of banalities with historical insight. Inspired by Cage's one-minute 
stories, <I>Year </I>(a work in progress) compiles the 60-second weather 
reports from 1010 WINS Radio in New York City for one year, exploring 
the narrative that arises from quotidian reportage as well as once again 
making everyday utterance manifest.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Although each of Goldsmith's 
works is audacious and original, it is entirely consistent. As a collector, 
compiler, composer, and arranger of everyday speech and the discourse 
of common culture, Goldsmith makes readers aware of the linguistic matter 
all about us, and the potential for it to be materialized. Further, 
in his publishing decisions, few writers have done so much to interrogate 
the boundaries between art and life.&nbsp;</P>
