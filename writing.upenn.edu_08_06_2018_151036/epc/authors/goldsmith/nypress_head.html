<P>"In and around the lake, marmots come out of the sky and they stand there..." A friend of mine thought that&#146;s what Yes was singing, well into his adult years. For months I thought the refrain to "Doo Wop (That Thing)" was "Cathleen." That seemed so sweet, Lauryn Hill singing an ode to a nice Irish-Catholic girlfriend of hers, that when I learned the real words the song&#146;s appeal was greatly diminished for me.</P>
<P>That&#146;s the thing about misheard lyrics: besides being so funny, they can be weirdly more right than the right lyrics. I love the image of those marmots dropping out of the sky and then standing around. Beats the hell out of the original&#146;s mushy symbolism.</P>
<I><P>New York Press</I> contributor and WFMU DJ Kenneth Goldsmith has put out a new little book that weds his musical interests with his mania for oddball lists (in previous books he&#146;s listed every word he said in a week, every gesture he made in a day, etc.). <I>Head Citations</I> (The Figures, 88 pages, $10) lists 800 misheard lyrics he culled from various sources. He readily admits this has been done before in books like <I>He&#146;s Got the Whole World in His Pants </I>and <I>When a Man Loves a Walnut</I>, as well as on websites like kissthisguy.com and amiright.com. Still, it&#146;s great to have so many funny lines in one handy pocket-size book you can take into the subway or whip out when your stoner friends come over. Here are a few samples:</P>
<P>"Oh, we are sailing, yes, give Jesus pants."</P>
<P>"No one knows what it&#146;s like to be the fat man."</P>
<P>"Doughnuts make my brown eyes blue."</P>
<P>"Gimme the Beach Boys and free my soul."</P>
<P>"Like a Ken Doll in the wind."</P>
<P>"Hey you, get off of my cow."</P>
<P>"I fight with Dorothy, and Dorothy always wins."</P>
<P>"Hold me closer, Tony Danza."</P>
<P>"You can&#146;t always get a Chihuahua."</P>
<P>"Pulling muscles with Michelle."</P>
<P>And, of course, "She&#146;s giving me head citations."</P>
