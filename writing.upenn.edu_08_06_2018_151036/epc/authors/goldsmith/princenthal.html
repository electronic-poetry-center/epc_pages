&quot;This may be my first work of total fiction,&quot; Kenneth
Goldsmith says of his latest project, <I><FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT></I>.
It's not what he had in mind. A multi-faceted project involving
a web site, a performance, an installation, an introductory pamphlet,
and a full scale book, <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT>
was meant to be utterly objective. Its premise was a movement-by-movement
auto-narration, achieved with a mike worn around his neck, of
his body's progress through the waking hours of June 16,1997;
the date, celebrated annually by James Joyce fans as &quot;Bloomsday,&quot;
is the same on which <I>Ulysses</I> transpires. Intended in part
as a kind of silent twin of Goldsmith's 1997 <I>Soliloquy</I>,
which recorded every word Goldsmith spoke for a week in the spring
of 1996, <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT> was to be as
laconic as that book was loquacious, as neutral as <I>Soliloquy</I>
was, occasionally, not. Goldsmith reread Joyce in preparation
for <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT>, and Beckett, too;
his aim was for a text entirely stripped of props-no attending
objects (description was to exclude anything outside his own skin),
no adjectives, no psychology. But alas for us all, bodies have
minds of their own. <BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget's</FONT> public life began
in the spring of 1998, with a performance at the Philip Morris
branch of New York's Whitney Museum of American Art, an exhibition
at Printed Matter in New York, and the publication <I>Selections
from <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT></I> (New York,
the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris and Printed
Matter, Inc./ Stadium Projects, 1998, signed and numbered edition
of 100, $10), an elegant little book containing the text of the
day's first three hours. Approximating the perfect egotism of
an infant, Goldsmith devotes rapt attention to every contracting
muscle and expelling orifice-indeed, to every active pore. Thus
absorbed, it takes him a full hour to get out of bed. Two more
hours go by not much more eventfully, though once he is up it
is surprisingly hard for the reader to figure out what he's doing.
The obscurity does not result from lack of candor; Goldsmith is
nothing if not frank about the least lovely of bodily functions,
from nose picking and mucus swallowing to eye rubbing and ass
scratching. It is simply that bodies are not easily recognized
in total isolation. So, inexorably if slowly, the rules begin
to break down. The long, arduous process of waking up can't be
described, he discovers, without naming bed and floor. By 11:00
there is metaphor (when upper teeth &quot;comb&quot; lower lip),
by 12:00 both cup and coffee.<BR>

<P>
It's <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget's</FONT> first hour that
figured in the performance, sung one phrase at a time by musician
Theo Bleckmann (who was invited to collaborate with Goldsmith
by the Whitney). Taking advantage of an odd, pulpit-like balcony
high above the gallery's tall lobby space Bleckmann intoned the
text in an extraordinarily flexible voice ranging from deep tenor
to falsetto; his voice was further modulated electronically and
augmented with percussion and keyboard. The performance, staged
on June 16 stressed the Joycean associations of the project, and
through Joyce established a connection to Catholic ritual, eliciting
ecclesiastic associations to the space and transforming the text
into a cross between a Gregorian chant and medieval Book of Hours.
As each phrase was sung, Bleckmann dropped the sheet of white
paper on which it was printed to the floor. These slowly drifting
sheets were collected by young boys dressed in Bloomsday-period
costumes (that is, turn-of-the-century), and presented to a small
battalion of similarly attired seamstresses. At the conclusion
of the hour-long performance, the two-piece suit into which the
paper sheets had been transformed was hoisted to the balcony so
that Bleckmann, who had stripped, could clothe himself in it.
<BR>

<P>
Paper suits, in turn, were the basis of the installation at Printed
Matter (there was also recorded music). The suit made during the
Whitney performance was hung on the back wall; eight additional
suits, in four pairs, were suspended down the center of the store,
and two more were displayed in the windows, resulting in one new
suit for each of the 12 hours Goldsmith was awake on June 16 (the
seamstress was Sydney Maresca). The exhibition introduced the
full text of <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT>, though
its legibility was progressively compromised: Goldsmith kicked
up the ink level on the copier 20 percent each hour, achieving
100 percent at 2:00 p.m., at which point he began xeroxing xeroxes.
(In a reversal that anticipates the published text, the final
suit is printed white on black.) The hourly decline from crisp,
pale letters on clean white paper to dark, smeary, and finally
unreadable text is meant, in part, to parallel the movement from
morning light to evening darkness. Though the decline in visual
clarity also suggests an underlying loss of narrative lucidity,
the overall impression of the installation is of verbally supported
propriety, of bodies protected, and rendered presentable, by the
words they produce.<BR>

<P>
For <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget's</FONT> equally well-tailored
electronic life at Stadium Projects (http://www.stadiumweb.com),
Clem Paulsen wrote a Java Applet (it can run on any platform)
in which the text is organized by hour, each represented by a
different colored screen. Within each hour, the program produces
a constantly changing selection of text fragments in a variety
of typefaces and sizes. Continuously fading in and out with mesmerizing
irregularity, the electronic <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT>
illustrates an aspect of physicality that the whole project makes
inescapably clear (and which accounts for its name): even at rest,
a living body is constantly, if incrementally, in motion (the
parallel with screensavers helped formulate Goldsmith's conception
for the website). Describing-or even observing-its ceaseless activity
in exhaustive detail is simply impossible. (And Goldsmith is not
easily defeated: in addition to his career as an artist, he maintains
a concrete poetry website, writes regularly about experimental
and classical music for New York Press, and has a weekly radio
program on WFMU called &quot;Unpopular Music.&quot;)<BR>

<P>
The collateral elements of <FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT>
are all, then, fairly proper, conceptually and formally: they
look good, they hang together. On the other hand, the full-length
unmanipulated text (also available on line at Stadium, and soon
to be published in Baltimore by Black Square Press, 1999, price
not yet determined; a CD may accompany the book) is deviant enough
to do Joyce proud. Having reached a kind of premature climax at
1:00 (given the book's premise, a bit of onanism seems inevitable),
Goldsmith has more than half the day to go and not much more in
the way of bodily function to relate without tedious repetition.
He pushes his fingers in his eyes and watches the stars. He stretches.
Scratches. He gets bored. And then his narration begins to unravel.
The text grows angrily staccato, silences itself (a nap?), and
reemerges in even testier single word exhortations. And then it
begins to expand, and blur, into prose that is florid without
being quite poetic, vaguely obscene, and, ultimately, incoherent.
In a word, it is drunk.<BR>

<P>
Goldsmith admits that by late afternoon, the entire exercise had
become so unexpectedly difficult and disturbing that he sought
escape by any means, first in sleep, and after that in a fifth
of Jack Daniels. Any coincidence with Leopold Bloom's after-hours
debaucheries was, Goldsmith says, unintended. He kept up the narration
for as long as he could, but transcription (under more sober circumstances)
proved nearly impossible. He was forced literally to reconstruct
the last hour of the day by reprinting his account of the first
hour but running it backward, word by word and letter by letter;
the directions of physical movement are also reversed. The reader
can only be relieved when, in a brief final restoration of semantic
order, Goldsmith allows his eyes to close.<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana, geneva">Fidget</FONT> conforms to the look
of Goldsmith's previous books: its design is simple and handsome,
and the type (following Beckett's late work) is given lots of
space. But Goldsmith knows this is a different kind of project,
one in which the most vigilant self-scrutiny produced the smallest
quotient of reliable fact. Art has had plenty to say in the last
decade about physical exigencies and desires. But Goldsmith alone
has had the good grace (curiosity? self-absorption? slightly wacko
sense of humor?) to let his body have the last word. Much to his
surprise, it spoke fiction.<BR>
