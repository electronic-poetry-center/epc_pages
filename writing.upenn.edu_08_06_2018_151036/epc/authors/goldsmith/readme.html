        face="Arial"> Talk a little about your choice of the [r]
        sound as the phonemic structuring element on &quot;No.
        111.&quot; A friend of mine recently came back to the
        midwest after living in South Africa for several years
        and he said we all sounded like pirates. He was really
        keying in on our intense midwestern [r] sounds. I've been
        particularly interested in [r] since reading Gerard
        Gennette's book <i>Mimologiques</i> which places the [r]
        sound at a pivotal point between animal communication and
        human speech. The grrr of a dog, or wrrrr of a monkey for
        example. So, in <i>No. 111</i> why [r]? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">Kenneth
        Goldsmith:</font><font size="2" face="Arial"> The sounds
        related around [r] is known in linguistics as the <i>schwa</i>
        [ah, ar, etc.]. I was inspired by the explanation given
        to me regarding the sacred significance of the Sanskrit
        word <i>aum</i>. It seems that when one speaks this word,
        all parts of the mouth are engaged: &quot;au&quot; forms
        on the outer lips; &quot;uh&quot;, spoken second, resides
        in the middle of the mouth and nasal area; and
        &quot;um&quot; finishes deep in the throat. <i>No. 111</i>
        is a book that was written to encompass the whole of
        speech and aural experience thus mirroring the Sanskrit
        ideal. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Is there any particularly rich
        vein in the language arts that you feel has not been
        explored? For example, in my opinion, the possibilities
        of simultaneous speech have barely begun to be tapped, as
        it is too often treated as a kind of &quot;sound
        effect&quot; and comes off as basically synonymous with
        the instruction &quot;insert chaotic sound here.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> I feel that the abundance of
        common, everyday speech which surrounds us has not been
        explored. We are drowning in a sea of language yet we
        feel we must jump through hoops to make it
        &quot;poetic&quot; or &quot;meaningful.&quot; Even our
        most advanced poetries still find a need to make language
        &quot;poetic.&quot; I am curious that there was never a
        literary equivalent to Pop Art (although I am reminded of
        Tuli Kupferberg's overtly expressive recitations of
        advertisements from the mid 60s). Andy Warhol's <i>A</i>
        is very good and I'm shocked that nobody took that
        direction into a fruitful practice. Along those same
        lines, the literary world has had few writers whom employ
        a Jeff Koons vacuum cleaner-like approach to literature
        or a Sherrie Levine appropriative use of words on a
        consistent basis. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I've lately been working
        on a piece which is nothing but media language &#151; the
        language that flows out of the television &#151;
        specifically advertising. It's language we tend to
        dismiss and as such, I've labeled it <i>entartete wörter</i>,
        that is degenerated words, what we consider to be
        language completely depleted of value; nutritionless
        language. Most people don't want to watch ads and there
        have been studies made that say we have no more than a 15
        second recall on what we've just watched on television.
        I'm curious as to what effect will occur when we gather
        an abundance of <i>entartete wörter</i> in one place. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Likewise, we are not
        paying attention to speech, the second most abundant
        human product after thought. A few years ago, I did a
        piece called <i>Soliloquy</i> which was a book of every
        word I spoke from the moment I woke up on a Monday
        morning until the moment I went to bed the next Sunday
        night. It was 400 pages long. The moniker for the book
        was &quot;If every word spoken in New York City daily
        were somehow to materialize as a snowflake, each day
        there would be a blizzard.&quot; I wanted to see how much
        one week of my speech &quot;weighed.&quot; I'm interested
        in concretizing the ephemeral; and there's nothing both
        more concrete, yet ephemeral, than language. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> That's a beautiful analogy. As a
        follow up, I've often felt that writers often jump
        through hoops to make their language or work innovative
        or experimental when the innovation is all around them.
        Someone recently asked me what avant-garde meant to me
        and I said that in one sense it seemed like a kind of
        political trick that I had gotten caught up in for years.
        I think this was largely because of the above. In what
        sense is being new or innovative important to you? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> An artist responding to their time
        cannot help but be new or innovative simply because
        parameters and paradigms shift constantly. This is
        especially pressing for artists using language which is
        radically shifting as of late. Only a few years ago, our
        culture was said to be moving toward the strictly visual
        (remember the Whitney's &quot;Image World&quot; show of
        the late 80s); the rise of the Internet has proved that
        wrong. In fact, due to the web we're responding to
        language in ways unimagined just a few years ago.
        Language is being influenced by the technology; compound
        word URLs are completely Joycean. Suddenly we can read <i>Finnegans
        Wake</i> and understand it in a different way. Rap music,
        which began compounding ordinary words to form
        mass-culture neologisms, is another example. Joyce
        certainly knew that one day we'd catch up to him yet he
        never could have anticipated that it would be the
        internet or rap music that would be responsible for it. I
        can imagine future generations understanding the <i>Wake</i>
        in ways my generation (or his) could never have imagined.
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Do you write by hand very often? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> No. I never write by hand. As a
        result, my penmanship has completely become illegible.
        It's bound to happen when people spend all their time
        typing. In fact, I think that cursive as we know it will
        be replaced by the script used on Palm Pilots, a sort of
        shorthand. Before I became devoted to the computer, I
        used to make drawings which I now no longer do. In fact,
        I find the computer to be physically engaging enough. I
        was trained as a sculptor so I have a need to make
        language physical, concrete. I find that sculpting
        language on the computer is satisfying enough. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> In your mind, does the method of
        writing you used in <i>No. 111</i> and <i>Soliloquy</i>,
        in the sense that you kind of open up a certain
        linguistic channel and then proceed to let the writing
        flow through that channel, place you in any way in the
        tradition of mystics like John Dee or even something like
        the Koran or the Book of Mormon? Or possibly even some
        American Indian traditions of storytelling? Given your
        method of writing these books, a follow up question then
        presents itself which is the question of authorship.
        Personally, I think this is a relatively boring question,
        i.e. &quot;is it really <i>your</i> work if other people
        said the words?,&quot; but I think some of our readers
        with inquiring minds might want to know. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Almost a century ago Duchamp
        settled these questions with his <i>Fountain</i>. After
        that, authorship simply became a matter of framing. I'm
        shocked how long it's taken our culture so long to
        legitimize framing or &quot;brushing&quot; content as a
        valid artistic practice. In the late 70s and we began to
        see artists like Sherrie Levine &quot;appropriating&quot;
        images and now, of course, we have a culture built
        entirely on sampling and recycled material. What was once
        branded &quot;plagiarism&quot; has long ceased to be an
        issue. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I don't feel comfortable
        with the word &quot;mystical&quot; associated in any way
        with my work. What I do, anyone can do. For example,
        anyone could rewrite <i>No. 111</i> using the rules I set
        up and it would turn out completely different. Same with <i>Soliloquy</i>:
        anyone can tape and transcribe every word they said for a
        week and the book would be entirely different. There's
        just too much shared common language out in the world to
        ever assume that we are solely possessive of it. Every
        thought I've ever had I've probably read or heard
        elsewhere, while wading through this thick band of
        language which surrounds us daily. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> You mention that you were trained
        as a sculptor. I'm curious, were there specific artists
        or, better yet, specific works that either forced, or
        eased, your transition into the world of sound poetry and
        concrete poetry from the world of sculpture. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> It was a long process moving into
        poetry from fine art which happened over the course of 15
        years. As a sculptor, my first mature body of work was
        very beautifully crafted plywood books, each with texts
        carved into them. As time went on, I became much more
        interested in the texts than in the craft of making the
        books. By the end, I was so invigorated by writing the
        texts that I began to feel resentful toward the enormous
        amount of time needed to craft each object. So I stopped
        making the books and began to instead focus on writing
        texts. I've ended up a writer, although I came to it in a
        most unexpected way. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Did any specific artists or works
        ease the transition? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Like generations before me, I read
        John Cage's <i>Silence</i> and found that it granted
        certain permissions I was seeking in my own practice.
        That was in the late 1980s and although <i>Silence</i>
        was published in the early 60s, it's amazing how potent
        that book still is. Cage's message goes in and out of
        fashion depending on the cultural climate but it seems
        that some portion of every generation ends up
        rediscovering it for themselves as I did. Recently, many
        of the experimental digital musicians are working out
        Cagean ideas and we're seeing rock groups like Sonic
        Youth embrace the same tradition. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> I suppose there is an obvious
        connection between your highly systematized method of
        writing and the work of the OULIPO group. However, I see
        a very significant philosophical difference. I think it
        comes from Cage's influence that you just mentioned and
        it all centers around the word &quot;Potential.&quot;
        Briefly, it's this. The OULIPIENS, even though they have
        produced many &quot;finished products&quot; are, at least
        philosophically, expressly interested in the formula or
        the system over the finished product. That's why they
        call it &quot;Potential Literature.&quot; Although many
        people don't see it this way, Cage was the exact
        opposite. For him, the detailed working out and
        realization of a system or formula was a critical step
        and this seems to be a critical step in your work also.
        For example, instead of actually recording and
        documenting all your speech for a day, you could have
        realized <i>Soliloquy</i> as a Dick Higgins' type of
        instruction that said &quot;Record and transcribe all
        your speech for 24 hours.&quot; To me that would have
        been a OULIPIEN versus a Cagean approach to the same
        project. There's a question in here somewhere, but I'll
        leave it to you to find. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> One of the greatest problems I
        have with OULIPO is the lack of interesting production
        that resulted from it. While I like the idea of
        &quot;potential literature,&quot; it strikes me that
        their output should have remained conceptual &#151; a
        mapping, so to speak; judging by the works that have been
        realized, they might be better left as ideas. On the
        whole, they embraced a blandly conservative narrative
        fiction which seems to bury the very interesting
        procedures that went into creating the works. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm interested in writing
        that is born of process and where the process is brought
        to the forefront of the practice. However, what is more
        interesting than process is the resultant writing. This
        sort of writing achieves a balance between Cagean chance
        operative writing and Oulipian ideals. It allows for a
        certain amount of control and a certain amount of
        surprise. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There's a type of sports
        practice that calls itself Extreme: Extreme Skiing,
        Extreme Skateboarding, things like this. I'm interested
        in Extreme Writing; and I'm convinced that the procedures
        that set it up inform the intensity of the writing.
        Without going through the rigorous exercise of
        documenting every move my body made over the course of
        one day, I never would have achieved the quality of
        writing that made <i>Fidget</i> the book that it is. And
        of course <i>Soliloquy</i> achieved the same intensity
        through its very rigorous process of production. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Anyone who has transcribed speech
        from tape recordings knows that there's a fairly large
        amorphous area of, let's call it &quot;material,&quot;
        that gets left on the cutting room floor. Stuff that
        maybe isn't &quot;language,&quot; but is certainly part
        of communication. Certainly things like coughs, throat
        clearing, hmms, umms, lips sticking together briefly,
        unusual breathing patterns are left out, but even
        phonemic stutters or repetitions of whole words often
        don't make it onto the transcribed page. What's your
        position on this &quot;material&quot; in relation to your
        work which sits, as it does, between spoken and written
        language? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> <i>Soliloquy</i> changed my entire
        relationship to the spoken word. After <i>Soliloquy</i>,
        I could never hear language the same way I did before. It
        became completely opaque and concrete, like lead.
        Sometimes now when someone is talking to me, I don't hear
        <i>what</i> they say but <i>how</i> they're saying it.
        The rhythms of speech come to the forefront &#151; the
        &quot;um&quot; and the &quot;ahs.&quot; After <i>Soliloquy</i>,
        I am never able to watch movies in the same way; after
        learning the divergent and stumbling nature of speech, I
        am never able to drop my suspension of disbelief &#151;
        the actors speak too streamlined and neatly! </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When it comes to
        transcribing the pieces, certain decisions need to be
        made. In <i>Soliloquy</i>, all the sounds I considered to
        be language-based went in it (the um's and ah's). The
        bodily sounds which you mention &#151; coughs, lips
        sticking together briefly, etc. &#151; all were moved
        into <i>Fidget</i>. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Next comes the task of
        writing and the formal decisions based around it. People
        often wonder why I punctuated, capitalized etc. the <i>Soliloquy</i>
        transcriptions instead of leaving it a flow of language
        á la Molly Bloom. I'm interested in the work reading as
        a <i>written </i>document, not simply as an historical
        documentation of spoken language during a certain period
        of time (although that is what created the work in the
        first place). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My work finds its final
        form as language although it assumes a variety of forms
        along the way: clothing, CDs, gallery installations, etc.
        are just a few of the many manifestations that my words
        have taken. While the parameters may be slightly shifted
        to produce an entirely different sort of products /
        projects, my work ultimately resorts to a writerly
        manifestation. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> I'd like to hear you talk about
        your show from 1998 which, I believe, was basically a
        show of concrete poetry stills taken from a web project.
        I'm particularly curious how collectors, buyers or
        investors, etc. reacted to purchasing website stills from
        the show. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> The show to which you're referring
        was a manifestation of the <i>Fidget</i> project which
        took many forms: a performance, a website, a musical
        score, a gallery exhibition and a book. For this show I
        made &quot;drawings&quot; based on an applet. I snapped
        screen shots of the <i>Fidget</i> Java applet and then
        entirely reconstructed the screen shots out of
        monochromatic hand-cut paper. They were very beautiful
        and very well crafted, yet they still failed to sell. The
        critical response, however, was different: The New York
        Times positively reviewed the show without once
        mentioning the derivation of the images; instead, they
        focused on the craftsmanship and the content of the work.
        In the art world, the cult of the artist's hand still
        reigns supreme. At this late date, artworks of mechanical
        reproduction still generally fail to sell. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the other hand, the web
        has given the hand-crafted arts a new life. Until a
        computer can reproduce the physically visceral qualities
        of a painting, painting remains a valid practice. In
        fact, with everyone creating graphics from the same tools
        such as PhotoShop and Illustrator, coupled with the
        limited aesthetic range of a 72 DPI screen, those things
        made by hand seem more important and valuable than ever. </font></p>

        very high prices for it. Of course, I never sold. </font></p>

        many of the folks involved in sound poetry as

        their art form. Your UbuWeb website dedicated to
        concrete, visual and sound poetry (ubu.com) is a perfect
        example. Some other examples just off the top of my head
        are Gaburo's Lingua Press, my own VOYS CD journal, any of
        the numerous Kostelanetz anthologies, Larry Wendt's
        curatorial work. There are lots of others. What do you
        make of this? Am I imagining that this phenomenon is more
        prevalent in soundtext work? What drove you to set up the
        UBU site? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> As I said before, poetry generally
        is so off the beaten track in this culture that if the
        producers of it don't set up the distribution channels,
        no one will. And since it lacks the capital and market of
        painting, it's of no use to museums who might actually be
        able to fund adventurous poetries which move along
        similar intellectual tracks as the art they're showing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I set up UbuWeb in 1996.
        In the late 80s Ruth and Marvin Sackner purchased some
        work of mine and flew me down to install their piece and
        see their collection. I was blown away by their 10,000+
        pieces and became very interested in this somewhat
        obscure art form (unlike Fluxus, concrete poetry has yet
        to realize any sort of intellectual / economic revival).
        When I first saw Netscape in January of 1995, I was taken
        by the way the graphics loaded and were laid out (the
        interlaced .gifs reminded me of Jean Bory's sequential
        concrete poems of the 1960s) and it occurred to me then
        that this was an ideal space to show text and image. I
        turned out to be correct: the first 5 years of the
        graphical web's existence has shown to be a perfect
        melding of text and image and sometimes the entire thing
        strikes me as one giant work of concrete poetry. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Last fall, my niece, who was in
        8th grade at the time, said she was going to do a paper
        on sound poetry because of what she'd seen there. She
        found it all on her own, just kind of by browsing around
        the web. She knew nothing about the subject (nor did her
        English teacher), but got really caught up in it through
        your site. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> I love stories like that. And they
        happen all the time. UbuWeb is on countless curriculums
        all over the world, ranging from grade schools to Ph.D.
        programs. One of the things that thrills me the most
        about the web's distributive paradigm is the potential
        for education and access. Today anyone anywhere can get
        offbeat and specialized knowledge from their home. Before
        the web, people were always able to acquire arcane
        knowledge, but it took a great deal more effort. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Does the creation of sound poetry
        or concrete poetry, in a way, automatically presume the
        question of distribution by the very non-book nature of
        these literary mediums? This goes back to my first
        question about the tendency of sound poets to get
        involved in distribution.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> I disagree that these literary
        forms have a non-book nature. Concrete poetry has always
        been delivered on the page and sound poetry has always
        been distributed on disc. What I'm saying is that the new
        methods of distribution are equally suited to unleash
        these forms from their old methods of distribution, with
        the result that they are readily available for more
        people around the world with at a touch of a finger. A
        book is no longer limited to the 1000 copies that were
        printed; an obscure sound poetry recording will now never
        go out of print. The web, at this point, delivers texts,
        pictures and sound very well, even with slow dial-up
        connections (it fails with moving images but this will be
        improving relatively soon). Thus, sound / concrete poetry
        needn't readjust its historic agenda to become suited for
        the web. New works will respond to the new medium and the
        old ones can quite happily live on in their older forms.
        UbuWeb shows this sort of mix. While our Historical
        section is comprised of static images that were either
        scanned or reformatted for the web, our Contemporary
        section is a mix of static and dynamic web-specific works
        made of Java, VRML, dHTML, Javascript, RealMedia, Flash,
        Shockwave, etc. These works are the one that move beyond
        the book &#151; they cannot be reconstituted for the page
        without losing some essential quality. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Distribution in the
        material world is changing too as the 20th century
        avant-garde is fetishized. One of the unexpected upsides
        of super capitalism is that there is an abundance of
        previously unavailable or out of print material from the
        historical avant garde. For example, an Italian record
        label, Alga Marghen, has been recently repackaging sound
        poetry discs gorgeously making them as sexy as any other
        commercial product. When I took Christian Bök into Other
        Music in New York City, he bought Alga Marghen's Gil
        Wolmans LP even though he doesn't own a turntable!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">EB:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> This abundance of material is also
        leading to what I like best about the whole
        &quot;electronica&quot; culture. Young kids who've often
        never heard experimental music listening to LaMonte Young
        or Stockhausen or Xenakis right alongside of Roni Size or
        Sonic Youth. I worked with this 17 year old guy and we
        got talking about music and so we swapped some CD's. The
        next day he said, &quot;That was great. I love electronic
        music.&quot; The funny thing to me was that I had loaned
        him &quot;Hymnen,&quot; yet he had no problem ingesting
        it right alongside &quot;Meat Beat Manifesto - Subliminal
        Sandwich,&quot; which he had loaned to me. Now, there's
        also an incredibly stupid downside to a lot of
        electronica (although there are incredibly stupid moments
        in &quot;Hymnen&quot; also). What do you think of the
        electronica world?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> I'm only interested in it in so
        much as it brings kids into art. Your teenage pal's
        Stockhausen / electronica connection was probably greased
        by Thurston Moore's own label, Ecstatic Peace!, releasing
        a 1971 performance of Stockhausen's <i>Kontakte</i>
        featuring James Tenney. Any Sonic Youth fan is bound to
        buy something released by their favorite rock star. It's
        not a great leap from the noisier bits of SY records to <i>Hymnen</i>.
        Their ears have been opened by SY. On Sonic Youth's
        recent CD, the one-time Lollapalooza headliners do
        respectable versions of John Cage, Christian Wolff,
        Pauline Oliveros, James Tenney, George Maciunas, etc.
        pieces. Again, the more curious kids buying this stuff
        will want to seek out more about these composers. I've
        seen the same thing happen when DJ Spooky plays
        electronics for Xenakis concerts: the kids come out in
        droves to see Spooky and I suppose that many become
        interested in Xenakis this way. </font></p>

        particularly influential on their work. These books were

        size="2" face="Arial"> I have sense that you responded to
        the &quot;favorite CD's&quot; question with a little more
        relish than the &quot;favorite books&quot; question. I
        heard Eddie Murphy say that he'd give up comedy and
        acting in a second if he could be Prince. I heard Wanda
        Coleman opine that Baraka would give up writing in a
        second if he could be Archie Shepp. Personally, if I
        could do what Sly Stone did in the 70's, I would drop the
        small press/experimental literature world like a hot
        potato. Am I imagining things or is there anything to
        this sense, as far as your work is concerned? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial">KG:</font><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> Yes and no. A recent book of mine,
        <i>6799</i>, is simply a list of my enormous LP and CD
        collection &#151; about 100 pages worth. And it happens
        to be sitting on my hard drive as I answer these
        questions. So I just scrolled down the list and grabbed
        the most essential ones. In the end, there seemed no
        reason to edit it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I've been a music fanatic
        since 1967 when I got my hands on The Monkee's <i>Headquarters</i>.
        Since then, I've been an unstoppable music junkie and
        can't live a day without buying a record. I also host a
        radio show on WFMU that is always hungry for new
        material. In addition, I write music criticism for New
        York Press and other publications. In all honesty, the
        only reason I went into music criticism was so I could
        get CDs for free. Now I'm hooked. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I have a hunch that we
        pursue those occupations where we're at a disadvantage
        rather than at an advantage. I'm a much more of a
        naturally talented musician than I am either artist or
        writer. But I love music so much that I never wanted to
        ruin it by making it my profession. So I turned to
        occupations that I wasn't as passionate about. As a
        result, music remains very free to me. I can have massive
        contradictions in taste and not have to explain myself.
        I'm simply a fan. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Oh, and in response to
        your Sly Stone comment, I another life I would be either
        Abbie Hoffman, Bob Dylan or Allen Ginsberg.<br>
