4. <i>Fall</i>

<br><br><br>
Well, we've got rain this morning and, in fact, it's going to really pour for several hours with the heaviest rain probably coming between, uh, eight to nine or about eleven o'clock. In that time period, there could be widespread street and highway flooding, so do allow yourself plenty of extra time to get around. It'll begin drying out late in the day, and tonight will become clear and cool. Tomorrow a sunny, beautiful day, afternoon high about seventy-two, and that ought to be the temperature in Central Park about three o'clock, as folks start gathering for the, uh, Dave Matthews concert. By nine o'clock, though, temperature down about probably to sixty-four. Thursday, sun followed by clouds, and there's a chance of showers again by the end of the day. Right now it is seventy and raining in Central Park, humidity one hundred percent, wind from the south, gusting to eighteen miles per hour. Again, the current temperature, seventy going up to seventy-six today. 
<br><br>A beautiful day, and, uh, sunshine will stay with us for the rest of the day, and temperatures get into the seventies this afternoon, very comfortable. For those folks, uh, who will be congregating in Central Park for the Dave Matthews concert tonight, about three o'clock, temperature at seventy-six, at six o'clock about seventy-two, by ten p.m. down to sixty-eight, and midnight, maybe down to sixty-four. So, cool after dark, maybe a light sweater or jacket. Tomorrow, sun followed by clouds, afternoon showers, and the high seventy-six. We get out, uh, toward Friday, it looks like a dry day with clouds and sun. Another chance of showers, though, long about Saturday. Sixty degrees and sunny now in Central Park, humidity seventy-two percent, and the wind light and variable. Again the current temperature sixty, going up to seventy-six today. 
<br><br>Uh, it is, eh, certainly a little warmer and more humid across the area during the course of this afternoon but, while we do have some sunshine, the clouds are going to be on the increase, and what we're dealing with over the Poconos, in terms of some wet weather, is going to continue to shift eastward. Now, once it gets east of the Delaware Water Gap, it is going to tend to, uh, thin out and weaken, but nonetheless I think, eh, during the middle, latter stages of this afternoon into early this evening there'll be a shower, thunderstorm in a couple of spots, high temperature seventy-six degrees, maybe a leftover shower tonight with the clouds, low sixty-two. Tomorrow, variably cloudy with this front stalling out, still can't rule out a shower, high seventy-four. But honestly, I think with the secondary storm system pulling down from the Great Lakes and the available moisture sitting on top of us, I'll look for steadier rain Saturday and a high of seventy-four. Right now it's seventy-two Caldwell, and in Central Park, that's with a lot of sunshine, mind you, going to seventy-six in midtown. 
<br><br>Our radar shows a smattering of showers immediately west and north of the city. Just about anybody can get a shower today, but the ones around this morning, uh, look like they're going move away, and the chance of a shower this afternoon, this evening, is less than this morning. Even this morning they're just, uh, very spotty. It's going up to seventy-four today, down to sixty-four tonight. Tomorrow, uh, another, uh, case of a spotty shower possibility, but most of the day being O.K., clouds, some sun, and humid, high seventy-six. Then rain is likely to fall in earnest tomorrow night into Sunday, followed by clearing later in the day Sunday, cooler with a high near seventy. Then for Monday, partly sunny and cool, high sixty-eight degrees. Currently in midtown it's sixty-three, the relative humidity eighty percent, it's mostly cloudy, watch for a couple of showers this morning, going up to seventy-four late today. 
<br><br>It's going to be a warm, sticky day today, with temperatures getting into the upper seventies to near eighty degrees, with clouds and some intervals of sun, but also a couple of showers and even a thunderstorm will move through the area. There appears to be a thunderstorm right now on the radar, in the Hackensack area moving north about fifteen to twenty miles per hour. Then tonight, look for more rain and thunderstorms to move into the area, particularly later at night, and lasting into tomorrow morning, the overnight low sixty-six. We'll clear out late tomorrow as a cold front moves offshore, the high seventy-two, then cool air takes over for much of next week, temperatures Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday only in the sixties with some sunshine each day. Right now across the tri-state, it is sixty-nine degrees in Somerville and in Westhampton, it's seventy-one and cloudy in Central Park, relative humidity one hundred percent, the winds southeast at eight miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature seventy-one going up to seventy-six in midtown. 
<br><br>Uh, we are looking at a clearing trend here tonight, eh, with temperatures comfortable, fifties, to around sixty, at daybreak. Cool weather much of the coming week and, uh, generally partly sunny skies each day, sixty-eight tomorrow, and sixty-four degrees for a high on Tuesday. Wednesday is the one day, eh, which, uh, may feature more clouds than sun, and it's the only day we're mentioning the possibility of seeing an afternoon or evening shower, high around sixty-four. And then Thursday, partly sunny, breezy, quite cool, only sixty-two. Currently we have... have, plenty of clouds, sixty-five degrees in Central Park, a northwest wind at ten to fifteen miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature sixty-five going down to sixty in midtown.
<br><br>Showers now crossing parts of Brooklyn and Queens, will head out across the rest of Long Island and also western Connecticut during the next hour or two, they pretty well ended across northeast New Jersey, and they weren't that heavy to begin with. A few places, uh, came down hard enough to wet the ground, give one one-hundredth, or two one-hundredths of an inch, in any case, it turns out partly sunny for the afternoon, high sixty-eight. Clear tonight, low fifty-four in midtown, suburbs closer to fifty. Tomorrow partly sunny, breezy, and cool, high sixty-four. One o'clock for the first pitch for the Yankees, should be sixty-two degrees, partly sunny, our estimate. Wednesday, changing amounts of clouds and sunshine, maybe a shower, high sixty-four. Then Thursday, partly sunny, breezy, and quite cool, high fifty-nine. Currently in midtown fifty-nine degrees, relative humidity seventy-seven percent, wind out of the west at five, fifty-nine heading for sixty-eight.
<br><br>The chilliest weather of this week actually still lies ahead of us, that chilliest moment will probably be Friday morning, in the meantime, today will be sunny to partly cloudy, with a high of sixty-six and at, uh, first pitch at Yankee Stadium this afternoon, it's probably around sixty-three and fair tonight, low fifty-four. Variable cloudiness tomorrow, there can be some sun, there could be a shower tomorrow, a high sixty-four, and then clouds and sun, brisk and quite cool for Thursday, the high fifty-nine. A mostly sunny day Friday, with a high of sixty-two. Right now it is fifty and sunny in Central Park, humidity is eighty-seven percent, wind from the west at three. Repeating the current temperature fifty going up to sixty-six today. 
<br><br>Well, partly cloudy skies, chilly conditions overnight, and we're looking at a windy, very cool day coming up tomorrow, with some sunshine, and a high temperature of only fifty-nine degrees, well below normal. Uh, the Yankees play tomorrow evening and, uh, looking at, uh, a partly cloudy sky, brisk conditions, and it's going to be a cool evening, temperatures, uh, at the start of the game around fifty-four degrees, and that temperature will continue to, uh, plunge tomorrow night under, uh, a clearing sky, uh, we'll get to around forty-six degrees in midtown, thirty-nine in some of the suburbs. Uh, Friday a good deal of sunshine, not as windy, as the high gets over to the East Coast, we'll still be upper fifties for a high, and then some milder weather for the weekend, a little sunshine Saturday, a southwest breeze, and it'll be in the upper sixties. The next front that may bring us a few showers, uh, later Saturday night and first thing Sunday morning. Currently fifty-six, mostly cloudy in Central Park, the west wind six to twelve miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature fifty-six going down to fifty in midtown.
<br><br>A weak cold front is causing a couple of showers in northeast Pennsylvania right now, they're probably going to slide north of the city in about two or three hours, could reach places like Poughkeepsie, and then head into the Litchfield Hills, northwest Connecticut. Overall, a partly sunny day going to fifty-nine. For the Yankees, game two this evening, temperature dropping through the fifties, into the upper forties, a chilly evening, it's going down to thirty-eight in some suburbs, forty-eight in midtown at daybreak. Tomorrow, sunshine for the most part, high fifty-nine, Saturday breezy, times of clouds and sun, but milder, going to sixty-eight. Next cold front will then approach, cause some showers Saturday night into Sunday, Sunday afternoon may start to clear, the high Sunday sixty-six. Currently the air is calm, relative humidity sixty-six percent, it's mostly sunny, fifty-two degrees heading for fifty-nine. 
<br><br>We start off with a chill in the air and frost in many of the outlying areas. Temperatures in the city got into the low forties, a few places got to the upper thirties, but now with the dazzling sunshine and very little winds, it's going to be pretty comfortable this afternoon, as it goes up to fifty-nine. Fair and cold, uh, this evening, going down to forty-five to fifty, not as cold as last night, though. Then tomorrow, some sunshine followed by cloudiness, high sixty-four. A system now coming through Minnesota and Iowa could cause some showers tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow night, tomorrow night's low fifty-four. That system will whisk on out of here Sunday and it'll turn partly sunny, the high sixty-four, and Monday looks nice, partly sunny sixty degrees. So no real, uh, big weather problems the next few days. Currently in midtown forty-one degrees, relative humidity seventy-five percent, the air is virtually calm, sunny, going to fifty-nine.
<br><br>Well, skies continue to cloud up as we have a cold front approaching from the west. It'll be windy and cooler the rest of today, and we will be... see a few periods of rain, from mid-morning on, a high of sixty-four. Nothing heavy in the rain, though, some clearing late tonight, it drops down to forty-four in the suburbs, and fifty-two in midtown. And, due to a cool Canadian air mass, it'll be brisk and cool tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday, with partly to mostly sunny skies and highs in the upper fifties to low sixties. It should begin to warm up nicely Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Right now it's sixty at JFK, fifty-eight at LaGuardia, mostly cloudy, fifty-seven in Central Park, sixty-nine percent humidity, a southwest wind at seven. Repeating the current temperature fifty-seven going up to sixty-four. 
<br><br>A very nice evening, uh, it's going to be cool overnight under a clear sky, low fifties in midtown, upper forties in many of the suburbs at daybreak, and a warmer day coming up tomorrow, uh, with plenty of sunshine, a gentle breeze, uh, seventy-five in the afternoon. So some great weather for the, uh, start of the American League Championship series tomorrow night. Uh, the Yankees will have, uh, clear skies, light winds, temperatures will be in the upper sixties when the game gets underway. Thursday, another nice day, mid-seventies, sunny to partly cloudy. Friday, uh, more clouds showing up, and that'll hold the temperature in the upper sixties in the afternoon, then we could see some rain come in on Saturday. Currently we have sixty-two in Caldwell, sixty degrees, clear in Central Park, the winds south, eight to sixteen miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature sixty going down to fifty-three in midtown. 
<br><br>Well, we're looking at, uh, clear, mild weather conditions tonight, only dropping to around sixty degrees in, uh, midtown at daybreak. Uh, patchy fog will be around for the early morning hours, and then it'll be turning mostly sunny, uh, as the day wears on. A warm afternoon, seventy-six for a high temperature, uh, again, very pleasant weather for game two tomorrow evening, temperature will be around seventy degrees as the game gets underway and, uh, it will be mild tomorrow night, a low around sixty-two. Friday may also have some fog early, otherwise clouds, some sunshine, at around sixty-eight. Over the weekend, the wind picking up Saturday, mostly cloudy, we'll start the rain either late in the day, or more likely, Saturday night and that'll likely continue right on through Sunday. We have sixty-seven degrees, a clear sky in Central Park, a southwest wind at eight. Repeating the current temperature sixty-seven going down to sixty in midtown. 
<br><br>Uh, we're going to have a nice day today with plenty of sunshine, and temperatures warm into the seventies, although a little cooler right at the shore. At Yankee Stadium this evening, it should be close to seventy at first pitch, or at least the upper sixties, and stay in the sixties throughout the game, so another very comfortable October evening for baseball. Tomorrow a mix of clouds and sun, back up into the seventies. We're going to continue to watch, for the next couple of days, this moisture that's down across the Carolinas. It's not racing northward, but there are some signs that at least some of it will come northward, and there is a chance for rain here by the end of the day on Saturday. Right now fifty-nine and sunny in Central Park, humidity is eighty-nine percent and the wind is calm. Again, the current temperature, fifty-nine going up to seventy-six today. 
<br><br>We do have low clouds this morning and, uh, a few fog patches but, uh, we think they'll evaporate as we get to mid-to-late morning, and there will be several hours of sun during the middle of the day, this afternoon, we'll get temperatures into the seventies. Then it's partly cloudy tonight, low sixty-two. Partly sunny, breezy tomorrow, high seventy to seventy-four, and then on Sunday, we're going to have to deal with a combination of a cold front approaching from the west and, uh, low pressure, uh, down along the Carolina coast that probably brings us clouds Sunday. There is at least a chance for some rain. Then the sun's back on Monday for Columbus Day, with a high of sixty-eight. Right now it's sixty-one and cloudy in Central Park, humidity ninety-three percent, wind from the northeast at ten. Repeating the current temperature sixty-one going up to seventy-four today. 
<br><br>And we are going to end up with plenty of fog, well, decent weather, as we hook through the rest of the afternoon, quite honestly. What a beautiful afternoon, temperatures heading to about seventy in the Park, plenty of sunshine throughout the tri-state area. We are going to see clouds unfortunately increase as we go through the night, though, and there is actually the possibility for a little drizzle later tonight and the early part of tomorrow, areas of fog, as well, as we start tomorrow morning, clouds might actually be breaking as early as later tomorrow. We are going to hit about sixty-eight tomorrow, seventy-two Monday with plenty of sun, and we are going to end up with beautiful weather again Tuesday, cool, sixty-eight degrees, but we should have plenty of sunshine. Seventy-one at Newark, seventy at JFK, same thing in the Park. It's mostly sunny in New York, relative humidity fifty-nine percent, wind northeast at twelve miles an hour, gusting to eighteen miles an hour, seventy now, we'll drop to sixty overnight in midtown. 
<br><br>Oh, we're looking at partly cloudy skies here this evening. Overnight it'll be mainly clear, breezy, temperatures will be in the low to mid-fifties for the morning rush hour. Uh, a beautiful day coming up tomorrow with, uh, sunshine and, uh, unseasonably warm conditions, uh, temperatures be in the low seventies in the afternoon. Uh, clear tomorrow night, low fifties and upper forties, and Tuesday, sunshine will be giving way to clouds, uh, ahead of the next, uh, frontal system, a high around sixty-six. That next front is likely to generate some steady rain, uh, it'll start late in the day or Tuesday evening, and continue through much of the night, uh, it'll end early Wednesday, and the rest of the day it's going to be quite windy behind this system, clouds, some sunshine with a high around sixty-four. Currently seventy-two degrees in Newark, we have sixty-eight in Central Park, clouds, some sun, a north wind, ten to twenty miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature sixty-eight going down to fifty-six in midtown. 
<br><br>Today will be dry, we'll have variable cloudiness, not out of the question if a shower shows up this afternoon, but overall a dry day, moderate temperature going to sixty-six. Not a lot of wind, either, and there'll be some sunshine, there's some now. Then rain will move in tonight, we have cloudiness during the next few hours. There can be some sunny breaks as a little slot of dry air comes in, and then the clouds will thicken overhead, and we do expect some rain to be around later this afternoon and this evening, today's high fifty-eight, going down to forty-five tonight. Then tomorrow, partly sunny, breezy, and cool, high fifty-six and, at first pitch time for game one of the World Series, temperature fifty-two degrees and partly clear. Sunday partly sunny, high sixty-two, Monday mostly sunny and sixty-two. Currently in midtown it's fifty-two, the relative humidity is sixty percent, the air is virtually calm. It's mostly cloudy, heading to fifty-eight today. 
<br><br>The rain that we had overnight is long gone. The radar is all quiet now, and we'll see enough sunshine today to boost temperatures well into the fifties this afternoon. If you're heading to The Bronx for game one of the World Series, dress warmly, it'll be dry, partly cloudy, fifty-two at the first pitch. Partly to mostly cloudy overnight, down to forty-eight in midtown, and forty-two in the colder suburbs. Gotta watch out for a weak area of low pressure to move by the area late tonight and tomorrow morning, there may be a little rain in the area with it, and clouds will break for some sun later tomorrow, with a cool breeze, and a high close to sixty. More sunshine than clouds Monday, high sixty-two, but the rain may return Tuesday afternoon with the high of sixty-six. Currently forty-three in Belmar and in Islip, forty-five and cloudy in Central Park, relative humidity one hundred percent, the wind west at six miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature forty-five going up to fifty-eight in midtown. 
<br><br>Well, we are looking at a shower in one or two spots, as we head through the early part of the afternoon, but probably after two or three in the afternoon, that chance of a shower will be diminishing to all but nothing. A little bit of sunshine, a high of sixty degrees, but skies will clear on out for game two of the World Series, temperature fifty-four degrees for first pitch, mainly clear tonight, low forty-four. Sunshine, some clouds on Monday, the high sixty. It'll be windy on Tuesday, maybe some showers possible, the high sixty-six. Cloudy to partly sunny, windy and cooler Wednesday, high fifty-eight. Fifty degrees and cloudy in Central Park, humidity coming in at eighty-nine percent, wind variable at six miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature fifty, we're going up to sixty in midtown. 
<br><br>Sunny to partly cloudy for the entire day, it's going up to sixty. Partly cloudy tonight, not as cold as last night, low fifty-two. Tomorrow we have a shot at seventy degrees, it'll be a windy day, though, variable cloudiness, could be a couple of showers as a cold front approaches, probably won't rain very long, if it rains at all. Then Wednesday, behind the cold front, windy and cooler with clouds and sun, perhaps a brief shower, high fifty-six. Thursday, partly sunny still windy and cool, high fifty-four. No major storms coming this week. Currently in midtown forty-six degrees, the relative humidity is seventy-three percent, and the air is virtually calm, forty-six heading for sixty.
<br><br>Well, partly cloudy, breezy overnight, we'll be in the low fifties at daybreak, and temperatures tomorrow staying in the fifties, uh, gusty northwest wind, clouds, a little bit of sun, it may even shower. Tomorrow night, uh, we'll get chilly, uh, around forty degrees in midtown, upper thirties in many of the suburbs. Thursday a chilly day, clouds, some sun, brisk, uh, with about, uh, temperatures in the upper forties. And then as we get toward the end of the week, uh, high pressure, which will be dropping in from central Canada, gets over to the eastern seaboard, we'll see more of the sun, temperatures in the mid-fifties on Friday, and then back into the middle-sixties on Saturday. Currently we have sixty under a cloudy sky in Central Park, wind out of the north at ten to eighteen miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature sixty going down to fifty-four in midtown. 
<br><br>Uh, mostly cloudy, brisk, cold overnight, eh, a sprinkle here and there, but nothing of consequence. Temperatures will be in the upper thirties at daybreak, we'll climb to forty-nine in the afternoon, clouds, breaks of sun, it still may shower. Uh, we'll drop back into the thirties tomorrow night, and then a warming trend Friday through the weekend, as the big high gets over to the East Coast, and the wind goes back around to the south, uh, a lot of sunshine. We'll be in the middle-fifties on Friday, low sixty Saturday, mid-sixties on Sunday under a partly sunny sky. In Central Park right now, forty-one degrees under a cloudy sky, with a north wind at ten. Repeating the current temperature forty-one going down to thirty-nine in midtown.
<br><br>No wet weather around these parts per our live scan radar, but it is partly sunny, it is windy, and it is colder than any day in recent memory, high temperature just forty-nine, factor in that wind, the real feel temperature, believe it or not, this hour is thirty-nine. That's cold! As a matter of fact, it's going to be clear and cold tonight, thirty-seven midtown, thirty-two suburbs. While that's happening, in the seventies in Miami, all game long. Good weather, at least down in that part of our nation. Meanwhile, we'll have sunshine, a little cloud cover tomorrow, not as cold, high fifty-four. Partly sunny Saturday, high sixty degrees, more clouds Sunday, with a high of sixty-six. We probably won't get wet until sometime on Monday. Right now forty-four Bridgeport, and in Central Park we've toned it down to partly sunny, but we'll manage a high of forty-nine this afternoon in midtown, high sixty-two.
<br><br>It's bright and brimming with sunshine, and it will go up to fifty-two this afternoon. Tonight, another chilly one, frosty, thirty-four in some suburbs, to forty-four in midtown. Tomorrow, sunshine mixing with clouds, but it's suddenly going to get a little milder, going to fifty-eight. And Sunday is apt to turn cloudy, it could rain later in the day, high sixty-six. Monday, cloudy and windy with rain likely, high sixty-two. So, obviously tomorrow would be better of the two days for outdoor activities. Currently thirty-seven degrees in midtown, relative humidity sixty-nine percent, winds out of the north at five miles per hour, thirty-seven heading to fifty-two. 
<br><br>Well, we've got a nice bright and sunny morning, and it looks like the dry weather will hold on through game six of the World Series tonight. We could have the first pitch temperature of fifty-four, but during the day today, it's going to be nice. It'll go up to about fifty-eight this afternoon, could be a little drizzle after midnight tonight, a low of forty-eight in the suburbs, and fifty-two in midtown. Cloudy, breezy on Sunday, just a little rain and drizzle at times, a high of sixty-four, and a soaking rain and wind for Sunday night and Monday, the high Monday about sixty-two. Right now, thirty-seven at JFK, it's forty-four at LaGuardia, we have sunshine, forty-five in Central Park, sixty-three percent humidity, and a southeast wind at six, forty-five right now headed up to fifty-eight today. 
<br><br>Well, it'll be mostly cloudy and milder today, we'll have a shower in spots, also some patchy drizzle, a couple of light showers moving across portions of western Suffolk County, as we speak. We'll have a high today of sixty-seven degrees. Mostly cloudy, breezy tonight, a bit of rain possible, with a low falling back to fifty-eight. Real rain comes in tomorrow, windy with wind-swept rain, could even be a thunderstorm, some of that rain heavy at times, with a high of sixty-five. Dry again on Tuesday, clouds and sunshine, with a high of fifty-eight. Maybe a little rain to start Wednesday, breezy, with clouds breaking for some sunshine, with a high right around sixty. Currently sixty-three deg... degrees in Caldwell, in Central Park it's sixty-four, relative humidity ninety percent, and a variable wind at seven miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature sixty-four going up to sixty-seven in midtown. 
<br><br>We had a squall line associated with a cold front, uh, which went through the, uh, region, during the, uh, late afternoon hours, uh, some places causing, uh, fifty, sixty mile an hour wind gusts, uh, but like I said, that has pushed well off to our east, uh, the rain is just about over as well. The radar is showing us dried out across northwestern New Jersey, down to about Philadelphia, and it'll be coming to an end in the city over the next hour or so, and, uh, continue to end from west to east, then out Long Island. Overnight, partial clearing, a low of fifty degrees. And tomorrow is a nice day, sixty under a partly sunny sky, could see a little rain once again late tomorrow night and Wednesday morning, but this'll be light, and then clearing Wednesday afternoon, the high of sixty-two. Fifty-six degrees and light rain in Central Park with a southwest wind, eight to sixteen miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature fifty-six going down to fifty in midtown. 
<br><br>And it's a nice day, uh, and we've got a break in the rain today, with sunshine followed by increasing clouds, temperatures get up to around sixty, but the combination of a new storm over the Great Lakes, and moisture along the Carolina coast, will combine to bring us rain beginning late tonight. It will rain through tomorrow morning, and end tomorrow afternoon, and some of that rain will be heavy enough to cause street and highway flooding. Tomorrow morning's rush hour is likely to be very messy, so plan on allowing yourself some extra time. Sunshine back for Thursday, though, Friday and Saturday also look like sunny days, with high temperatures around seventy. Right now it's forty-eight and sunny in Central Park, humidity seventy-three percent, the wind is calm. Again, the current temperature, forty-eight, going up to sixty today. 
<br><br>As we continue to keep tabs on our, uh, live scan radar, the, uh, steadiest, heaviest of the rain is already east of Islip. That's going to be moving away within the, uh, next hour here. Farther off to the west of that, ur, rain corridor, honestly to just, you know, light rain showers, sprinkles if you will. Now, there are additional showers back over Pennsylvania, but they're hit or miss. So, you know, we're still going to get on the wet side this afternoon, but it's nothing compared to what we just went through. Otherwise, rather cloudy, high temperature this afternoon fifty-nine degrees. We clear it tonight, forty suburbs, forty-eight midtown. And the sun is back! It's beautiful! I say that because it's sixty-four tomorrow, sixty-eight Friday, seventy degrees on Saturday. I hope you have outdoor plans after this mess we're going through now. Fifty-six this hour Caldwell and in Central Park, we'll manage fifty-nine this afternoon in midtown. 
<br><br>Gorgeous weather continuing across the region and, the beauty of the air mass, and I passed this along before, but I want to do so again, if you don't have opportunity to take advantage of it this afternoon or perhaps tomorrow, it's still gonna be great, Saturday, Sunday, and there's no threat of wet weather until next week. So, with that being said, sixty-four this afternoon, mainly clear tonight, forty-two suburbs, fifty-two midtown. Sunny to partly cloudy tomorrow, breezy, high sixty-eight. Partly sunny on Saturday, with a high of seventy-two degrees. If there's a stumbling block, could be a little of morning fog tomorrow or Saturday, but I wouldn't count on it. Count on fifty-nine degrees this hour in Bridgeport, sixty-one Belmar, fifty-nine, by the way, with the sun in Central Park, going to sixty-four in midtown. 
<br><br>It is going to be beautiful today, high temperature sixty-eight with the sunshine. We do have bad news for one Halloween monster, however, who likes to fly it's kite in a thunderstorm, the Franklinstein. Anyway, partly cloudy tonight, going down to fifty-eight. Intervals of clouds and sunshine tomorrow, breezy and warm, high seventy-four. For the marathon Sunday, partly sunny, high sixty-four. Monday, breezy and very warm for early November, with clouds and sun, perhaps a shower, high seventy-six, and then probably cooler on Tuesday. But for today, going to sixty-eight. Currently fifty-two degrees in midtown, relative humidity eighty-seven percent, the air is calm and it's sunny, fifty-two heading to sixty-eight. 
<br><br>Well, I don't think you should sit around the house today, enjoy this Indian summer weather. We're going to have temperatures go up to seventy-four for this first day in November. How about that? Normal high is fifty-nine. Partly to mostly cloudy, a couple of sprinkles tonight, down to fifty-four. Tomorrow cooler, but still very nice, clouds and sun, a high of sixty-four. And for Monday, sun and clouds, record-challenging warmth, now, we're expecting a high of seventy-six. The record is seventy-eight set in 1990. We'll be very close to that. Right now fifty-four at White Plains, it's fifty-three at Bridgeport. Very mild morning, cloudy, fifty-seven in Central Park, eighty-three percent humidity, a southwest wind at six. Repeating the current temperature fifty-seven headed up to seventy-four.
<br><br>Checking the current radar, we see a couple of showers cruising through the Long Island Sound, also a couple of showers about to, uh, move across, uh, Staten Island at this time, a hit or miss shower out there this evening. Later on tonight, partly to mostly cloudy, the low fifty-eight. Record-challenging warmth tomorrow, intervals of clouds and sunshine, the high seventy-six. The record is seventy-eight set back in 1990. Maybe a few fog patches tomorrow night, perhaps a shower later on, low fifty-eight. A flow from the ocean sets up Tuesday and Wednesday, inland areas can still climb into the seventies on Tuesday. We should see a high around sixty-four in New York City, variable clouds, and a chance of that shower. A better chance with more generous rainfall here on Wednesday, the high sixty-four. Thursday, a shower possible early, then mostly cloudy, high sixty. Currently it's sixty-four, mostly cloudy in Central Park, the relative humidity seventy-two percent, the winds south to southwest, averaging five to ten miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature sixty-four going down to fifty-eight. 
<br><br>Reasonably warm day coming up today, in fact, so unseasonably warm that we may challenge record-high temperatures. That record-high in Central Park is seventy-eight, goes back to 1990 and, uh, that's certainly a number that's reachable. Some fog outside of the city this morning, otherwise just kind of a murky start to what will be, at least, a partly sunny day, then clouds tonight and, uh, the low fifty-eight. Tomorrow, clouds and cooler, and there may be a shower, high tomorrow sixty in midtown, sixty-five in adjacent New Jersey, but only fifty-five on, uh, Long Island and in Connecticut. Chance of showers Wednesday, maybe into Thursday morning, and then partly sunny Thursday afternoon, the high around sixty. Right now it is sixty-three and partly cloudy in Central Park, humidity is ninety-three percent, wind from the southwest at ten. Again, the current temperature sixty-three, going up to seventy-six today. 
<br><br>A tricky day of weather today, uh, clouds and sun will probably alternate, uh, but the thing is it's a lot cooler than yesterday when we got to a record high of seventy-nine. Today the temperature can sneak into the sixties for a while this morning, then wind up in the fifties again this afternoon and, uh, drizzle and fog settling in this evening, and remaining with us into tomorrow morning. Tomorrow gets milder, temporarily, up to sixty-eight, and then we get some rain tomorrow night into Thursday morning. Clearing beginning later Thursday, followed by a partly sunny, windy, cool day Friday, high fifty-six. Right now the weekend looks dry, but chilly. Right now it is mostly sunny and fifty-nine in Central Park, humidity ninety-six percent, wind has shifted into the northeast now at seven. Again, the current temperature fifty-nine, going up maybe to sixty-six this morning, dropping again during the afternoon. 
<br><br>Ah, take your umbrella, uh, take your coat, uh, leave your sunglasses behind today, they would certainly be excess baggage. It'll be overcast, drizzle, rain at times, uh, areas of fog, and that's the case today and tonight. It will slowly get milder, but this high of sixty-eight that we're talking about today probably does not occur until after dark, until some time between eight p.m. and midnight, and most of the day today will be considerably cooler than that. Cloudy tomorrow, some rain in the morning, sun's back for Friday but cool, high fifty-six. Sunshine both days of the weekend, but cold with highs in the forties. Right now fifty-one and cloudy in Central Park, humidity ninety-six percent, wind from the northeast at ten. Again, the current temperature fifty-one going up to sixty-eight, but not until the evening. 
<br><br>We'll have cloudiness this morning, uh, not much going on rainfall-wise the next several hours, but rain will fall this afternoon and this evening, and we can get a soaking at that time, the high today sixty-two. Tonight, cloudy and cooler, low forty-six. Tomorrow brisk and cool, times of clouds and sunshine, high fifty-eight, and then a chilly, but dry weekend. Saturday sunny, high forty-six, Sunday sunny, high forty-six, not quite as chilly early next week. Currently in midtown fifty-eight degrees, relative humidity ninety-three percent, wind north at six miles per hour, fifty-eight heading to sixty-two. 
<br><br>Partly to mostly sunny today, it's going up to sixty. Clearing tonight, low thirty-two in some suburbs, forty in midtown. Tomorrow much colder than today, with some sunshine and a brisk wind, high forty-six, then we have the total lunar eclipse tomorrow night. It's totally the opposite of the case of solar eclipses, where total eye protection is necessary, whether the eclipse is partial or total. In this case you don't need any eye protection, it's a total one this time not a partial. Sunday, brisk and still cold, high forty-six. Monday, some sunshine followed by increasing cloudiness, high fifty-four. Currently, winds out of the north at six miles per hour, the relative humidity eighty-six percent, forty-nine degrees in midtown heading to sixty. 
<br><br>It's going to be a chilly day today, no no no no eg... uh, way to get around it. Temperatures have been falling all morning long, we'll only recover to about, let's say forty-six, for a high this afternoon in midtown, despite a lot of sunshine. And it looks like a freeze-morning for tonight, late tonight, between midnight and eight a.m., when it'll be clear, breezy, and cold, lows in the twenties in most suburbs, thirty-two in midtown. Sunny tomorrow, brisk and cold, high forty-four. Sunny to partly cloudy Monday, high fifty-two, the clouds return Tuesday with them, a chance for some rain on Veteran's Day, the high fifty-four. Right now it's thirty-nine in Caldwell and White Plains, forty-one and sunny in Central Park, relative humidity forty-six percent, the wind northwest at nine, gusting to twenty-one miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature forty-one going up to forty-six in midtown. 
<br><br>A kind of a good and bad thing today. We have a lot of sunshine out there today, that's a good thing, but it's going to be very chilly out there, brisk as well, we'll have a high of only forty-four degrees. Clear and cold again tonight, low falling back to about thirty-four degrees in midtown, a lot of the suburbs falling back into the twenties, though. Mostly sunny, still a bit chilly tomorrow, with a high up to about fifty degrees. Now to look ahead to Tuesday and Wednesday, mostly cloudy skies, could be some rain or drizzle, either day, Tuesday's high fifty-two, Wednesday's high up to fifty-six. Currently thirty-four degrees in White Plains, thirty-four degrees in Teterboro, in Central Park, lots of sunshine, thirty-three, relative humidity forty-seven percent, and a northwest wind at five miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature thirty-three going up to forty-four in midtown. 
<br><br>It is chilly, but it's going to warm up to fifty this afternoon, that's not all that warm, but it won't be very windy. Clear early tonight, partly cloudy after midnight, low thirty-four in some suburbs to forty-one in midtown. Now, tomorrow will be a little warmer than today, going to fifty-four, but the breeze is going to be a little stronger and clouds will increase, could be a little bit of rain in the afternoon and at night, as a warm front approaches. Wednesday the warm front will go by, but a cold front will approach. That could mean some rain, high fifty-eight. Then behind the cold front, times of clouds and sunshine, blustery, chilly again Thursday, high fifty-two. Currently thirty-four, relative humidity fifty-eight percent, the air is virtually calm, it's sunny, thirty-four heading for fifty. 
<br><br>It's a little warmer this morning than it was at this time yesterday. Cloudiness will increase today, could be a little rain or drizzle later this afternoon, going up to fifty-two, only down to fifty tonight. Now, tomorrow will feel genuinely mild, there will be a fair amount of cloudiness around, maybe a shower, but most of the time just the clouds, high sixty. Then a strong cold front will sweep through tomorrow night, or first thing Thursday, triggering some gusty showers behind it. Winds could gust to forty miles an hour out of the northwest Thursday as temperatures drop from the fifties into the forties. Friday, sunny but with a cold wind, high forty-six, so we'll be back in the same place we started the week. Currently in midtown forty-one degrees, relative humidity fifty-seven percent, winds southwest at three miles per hour, it's mostly cloudy, forty-one heading for fifty-two. 
<br><br>Well, while the clouds continue to hang tough across the region here this afternoon, high temperature fifty-eight degrees, we are going to see some holes, uh, developing here but, I tell you what, the... very easily it turns out overcast later tonight, rain is in after midnight, could even be a heavy, gusty thunderstorm by daybreak, with a low temperature of fifty degrees. Tomorrow, dry and it's going to turn out partly sunny, but there's problems, it's going to be the wind, upwards of fifty miles an hour on occasion, speed restrictions. So that's going to equal more delays than we typically have for the morning rush hour. High tomorrow morning fifty-two, temperatures into the forties during the afternoon, and winds will continue to be just as strong tomorrow night, maybe coming down a notch on Friday, but still windy enough with some sun, the chance of a snow flurry, Friday's high forty-four. Right now fifty-five in Teterboro, also in Central Park, going to fifty-eight in midtown. 
<br><br>We're going to have very strong winds today. The winds are going to gust past fifty miles per hour at times and this is going to bring down some tr... tree limbs, power lines. Already thousands of people as close as Philadelphia are without power, across parts of New Jersey as well. This all spreading northeastward. The other thing today is the temperature's going to be falling, so dress warmly. It's going to be going down through the forties, could even reach the upper thirties by seven o'clock this evening. There could be a snow flurry or two, overall though, a dry pattern. And then tonight, the temperature is going to be sinking toward thirty-three, thirty-four degrees, as a strong wind continues. Tomorrow a little less wind, the high forty-four, but it'll feel like it's freezing with the real feel temperature. Saturday, sunshine, high fifty-two, Sunday partly to mostly sunny, high fifty-two degrees. But today the main story is the wind, and currently the wind is out of the west, northwest at twelve, gusting to twenty-eight miles per hour, a few communities have gusts over forty. The temperature, sixty degrees, heading down into the fifties and then the forties.
<br><br>We're still getting winds gusting in the, er, forty, forty-five mile per hour range. We don't expect them to be as fierce as yesterday, but they're certainly still formidable and it will, by all counts, still be a windy day, uh, it will also generally be a sunny day, with temperatures getting into the forties. And tonight clear, diminishing wind, with lows in the thirties. Less wind tomorrow, it should be a pretty good day tomorrow, sun, followed by some clouds, the high fifty-two, and then mostly cloudy Sunday, high also fifty-two. Not a... out of the realm of possibility that there's a little bit of rain around on Sunday as well. Right now partly cloudy, thirty-five in Central Park, humidity forty-two percent, wind from the west, gusting to twenty-four. Again the current temperature thirty-five going up to forty-four. 
<br><br>Well, you know it's a pretty nice morning out there, we have plenty of sunshine and unfortunately we can't shake that, uh, chilly, gusty breeze. It won't be as windy as the last couple of days, but nonetheless the chilly, gusty breezes continue for one more afternoon, along with the sunshine, a high of around fifty-two, that's pretty much typical for this time of year. Partly to mostly cloudy tonight, uh, low forty-two. Tomorrow we'll call it variably cloudy, we'll see some sun at times, the high around fifty-two. Then times of sun and clouds and, uh, about fifty-two on Monday, so not much change through Monday, and then a chance for rain coming in on Tuesday. 
<br><br>Well, it's going to be a mostly cloudy day today, we could see a couple of sprinkles around for about the next hour or two. Other than that, it looks mainly dry and just cloudy, with a high of fifty degrees. Mostly cloudy tonight, a little more rain and drizzle comes in after midnight, with the low slipping back to about forty-four. Maybe a little rain, drizzle to start the day tomorrow, then some afternoon sunshine with a high of fifty-two. Mostly cloudy day on Tuesday, chance of rain, especially during the afternoon and the nighttime hours, with a high of fifty-six. As we look ahead to Wednesday, a cloudy, windy day with periods of rain. A little bit warmer, though, with a high around sixty. Currently in Central Park, we have a cloudy sky, it's forty-five degrees, relative humidity sixty percent, and a wind out of the west at five miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature forty-five going up to fifty in midtown. 
<br><br>Partly to mostly cloudy tonight, patchy fog, temperatures not moving much. We'll still be in the forties for the morning rush hour, and then tomorrow, a mostly cloudy day, maybe a bit of drizzle in the afternoon with a high of fifty-four. Mostly mild weather for the rest of the week, but it's certainly going to turn very, very wet as well. Uh, we have a front right now which is cutting down through the Plains and into Texas, uh, it's going to be pushing over to the East Coast, stalling here, as a storm forms on the boundary, and brings us quite a dose of rain from Wednesday onward, uh, especially, uh, Wednesday afternoon and night, it could be heavy at times, a high of fifty-eight. Thursday and Friday, cloudy, windy, additional rain, uh, a good, uh, likelihood, a high temperature both days of fifty-four. We have forty-eight degrees right now in Central Park, it's a cloudy sky, northeast wind at seven. Repeating the current temperature forty-eight going down to forty-six in midtown. 
<br><br>We have a lot of cloudiness, but there won't be much production from these clouds because they're really not all that thick, even though it looks gray, the high temperature this afternoon about fifty to fifty-four degrees. It may just hold up like yesterday, it got to fifty in the late morning, then just sat there. Certainly, it's not going to be all that warm today, cloudy and breezy tonight, whatever it gets to today, it doesn't drop much tonight, the low fifty. Then tomorrow cloudy, windy, becoming warmer than today, warmer for November, of course, a bit of rain early, steadier, and heavier in the afternoon, high sixty-two. Thursday, cloudy and windy with periods of rain, high fifty-four, and Friday also could be damp, with a high of fifty-four. Currently it's forty-six, the relative humidity ninety-three percent, wind light and variable, it's forty-six heading to fifty-four. 
<br><br>It isn't raining everywhere but where it is raining, the showers are heavy, and a batch of them are crossing the area, from southwest to northeast right now. The main batch of rain is going to be later this afternoon and this evening, it's almost like a wall of water on the radar and will actually appear that way, but it'll be pouring late this afternoon and this evening, we can even get a thunderstorm at that point, temperatures reaching the low sixties. Then tonight the rain'll taper off late, and tomorrow, come to an end for a while. Now the big question for tomorrow and Friday, is whether we actually get additional rainfall or it shifts offshore. It's going to be a very close call, and we can be expecting temperatures in the mid-fifties. The weekend looks good, partly sunny Saturday, high sixty degrees. Currently in midtown fifty-seven, relative humidity one hundred percent, wind out of the south at nine, fifty-seven heading to sixty-one.
<br><br>Our radar shows that there is still some more rain for us this morning, especially from the city across Long Island into Connecticut, much less across New Jersey, just a few leftover showers are starting to clear, back of the Delaware River. That whole trend will progress eastward, and we'll see some clouds breaking for sunshine later today, the high fifty-six. Clear and chilly tonight, low thirty-six in some suburbs, forty-six midtown. Tomorrow a beautiful sunny day, high fifty-eight, and the weekend, spectacular for the week before Thanksgiving, sunshine, high both days sixty degrees. Currently, the winds out of the north at four miles per hour, relative humidity ninety-two percent, forty-six degrees in midtown heading to fifty-six this afternoon. 
<br><br>It's a fine morning, we'll have dazzling sunshine today, becoming milder, high temperature sixty-two. Clear tonight, low forty in some suburbs, to forty-eight in midtown, and then the weekend looks great, one high pressure area will be leaving, another comes in. We don't see any storms, high temperatures both days around fifty-eight in midtown, warmer inland, cooler at the coast. Looking at Monday, increasing cloudiness, chance of rain later in the day and at night, high on Monday sixty. Currently in midtown forty-five degrees, the relative humidity sixty percent, winds out of the west at five miles per hour, forty-five heading for sixty-two. 
<br><br>It looks like a very nice day out there today, lots of sunshine, mild temperatures with a high getting up to near sixty degrees. It'll be clear to partly cloudy tonight, low slipping back to forty-six. Lots of sunshine again tomorrow, not as mild, but still pretty nice for this time of year, high of fifty-six. On Monday, morning sunshine, followed by increasing clouds, becomes windy, could be some rain late in the day, but more likely at night, high sixty-two. Then a partly sunny, breezy, cooler day for Tuesday, Tuesday's high only forty-eight. Currently fifty-three degrees at Newark, fifty-four degrees at LaGuardia, in Central Park lots of sunshine, fifty-two, relative humidity fifty-eight percent, and a variable wind at seven miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature fifty-two going up to near sixty in midtown.
<br><br>Well, it may be late November, but these nice balmy temperatures will continue right through Monday. Today just beautiful, fifty-eight this afternoon with sunshine. Tonight, clear to partly cloudy, down to forty in the suburbs, forty-eight in midtown. Sun followed by clouds tomorrow, some rain at night, the high tomorrow near sixty. Then brisk and colder Tuesday and Wednesday, sunny to partly cloudy, highs in the upper forties to low fifties. Everybody's wondering about Thanksgiving Day. Well, I think we're gonna see some rain for Turkey Day, especially in the afternoon. Now, right now we have forty-five in Morristown, forty-six in Islip, sunshine and forty-eight in Central Park, seventy-three percent humidity, east winds at eight, forty-eight right now, going up to fifty-eight today. 
<br><br>Clouds increasing after a beautiful weekend, and it does look like some rain on the way starting late afternoon or early evening, and then it'll rain for, ur, five or six hours during the night tonight, and clear up late tonight, turn blustery and chilly, though. Our high today up to fifty-nine, low tonight forty-two. Tomorrow a sunny day, but brisk and colder, the high forty-eight. Mostly sunny and seasonably chilly on Wednesday, the high of fifty. Then clouding up on Thanksgiving Day, with a chance of rain, hopefully late in the day, but we'll keep you posted on that. Forty-six and partly cloudy now in Central Park, humidity eighty-eight percent, wind out of the east at four. Again, the current temperature forty-six going up to fifty-nine today. 
<br><br>It will be chilly, but it will be sunny today with the temperature, uh, getting up to about forty-eight this afternoon, then it'll be clear and cold tonight, low middle-thirties, in the city but the twenties in most suburbs. Sunshine for the most part tomorrow, with a high near fifty. We get to Thanksgiving Day, we'll have thickening clouds, and then by the end of the day, some rain. But it looks like that rain will hold off long enough, we'll be able to get the, uh, parade festivities in, and by the time it starts to rain, most of us, uh, including yours truly, uh, may be asleep on the couch. And Friday is partly sunny, windy, and chilly again. Thirty-seven and sunny now in Central Park, humidity fifty-nine percent, wind out of the northwest, gusting to eighteen miles an hour. Again, the current temperature thirty-seven, going up to forty-eight today. 
<br><br>No snow. No rain. No fog. The three big dangers of travel this time of year, and that's the case up and down the eastern seaboard as it's a dry day, and also dry into most of the Midwest, afternoon temperature getting to fifty-two today, down to forty-four tonight. Tomorrow, clouds and sunny breaks, temperature forty-six around nine in the morning, then in the afternoon getting into the fifties, and it'll rain tomorrow night and Friday morning, becoming windy Friday afternoon with some clearing, high fifty-eight. And Saturday looks like a cold, blustery day, it'll feel like it's in the thirties all day with gusty, northwest winds. Currently thirty-seven degrees in midtown, relative humidity sixty-nine percent, wind northeast at five, thirty-seven heading for fifty-two. 
<br><br>Crowds are lining up already for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, temperature in an hour forty-six. It'll climb into the low to mid-fifties this afternoon, just a beautiful day, but then rain will be arriving overnight, and will last into tomorrow, and by this time tomorrow the, uh, the weather'll look, uh, a lot drippier than it'll be right underneath where the, uh, turkey is dripping into the pan today. Tomorrow's high fifty-eight degrees and Saturday, wind, much colder, intervals of clouds and sun, could be a flurry especially in the morning, high forty-six, the real feel temperature will be near freezing, and Sunday still windy with some sunshine, high forty-eight degrees. So a cold, but dry weekend coming up. Currently in midtown forty-three degrees, relative humidity sixty-seven percent, the air is calm. It's partly to mostly cloudy across the area, forty-three heading to fifty-four. 
<br><br>With the... between the rain and the fog today, it will be, uh, messy driving if you're driving about, uh, periods of rain continuing well into tonight, some of it heavy, the high this afternoon sixty. There is a dense fog advisory now for Bronx, The Queens, uh, The Bronx and Queens and all of Long Island, and up into Connecticut as well, so please be careful if you're driving. It's going to become windy and colder late tonight, with the low down near forty by daybreak, and then a rain or snow shower possible early tomorrow, very windy and colder, with some sun in the afternoon, winds gusting past forty miles per hour. So the high will reach forty-six, but the real feel temperature will only be thirty-two, degrees for a high tomorrow. Sunday, partly sunny and windy, high fifty. Monday, variably cloudy with a chilly wind, high forty-six. Tuesday, mostly sunny and chilly, high forty-two. Currently in midtown it's fifty-four degrees with light rain, relative humidity of one hundred percent, winds out of the south at nine, the barometer twenty-nine point eighty-three and falling. Repeating the temperature fifty-four going to a high of sixty today. 
<br><br>Strong winds have pushed the rain and warmth of the tri-states, uh, that we had yesterday well offshore, in fact, today's just going to be a very windy, chilly day with clouds and some sunshine, and it's a sprinkle, or even a flurry, our high forty-six. Those winds will gust over forty miles an hour at times. Tonight, partly cloudy, less wind, a low in the low to mid-thirties. A mix of sun and clouds on tap for tomorrow, a high near fifty. It'll become windy Monday with more sun than clouds, high forty-eight. Blustery and cold Tuesday, partly sunny skies, the high close to forty. Currently it's forty-three in Islip and at LaGuardia, forty-two and cloudy in Central Park, relative humidity fifty-seven percent, the wind out of the west at seven, gusting to twenty-three miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature forty-two going up to forty-six in midtown. 
<br><br>A windy day today, with a mix of clouds and sunshine. There's a slight chance for a sprinkle, uh, mid to late morning as a cold front approaches and passes through the area. And behind that, the wind will really kick up, could gust to between thirty and forty miles an hour this afternoon, and it will get colder tonight, with a low down near freezing in the city, and windy and cold with sunshine tomorrow, the high temperature tomorrow only thirty-six, and the real feel temperature will be well down into the twenties. Sunshine, less wind but still cold Wednesday and Thursday, and then increasing cloudiness on Friday. Right now it is forty-six and partly cloudy in Central Park, humidity fifty-three percent, southwest wind gusting to eighteen miles per hour. Again the current temperature forty-six going up to fifty today. 
<br><br>It's squalling in some neighborhoods, not everywhere, in fact, in most places it's either flurrying or, uh, not snowing at all, but we've had a couple of intense snow squalls. They don't last much more than ten minutes or so. One is now, uh, moving into, uh, Suffolk County east of Mineola and the other one, coming across the Bronx, it'll probably, uh, get to Flushing, uh, around Shea Stadium, in, uh, the next, uh, ten to twenty minutes. Then there'll be sunshine, uh, but the wind and the cold will be constant today, with the high in the middle-thirties. Then it's clear tonight, low near twenty. Sunny, less wind and cold tomorrow, increasing clouds Thursday and Friday, into the weekend. We may have to deal with a real nor'easter-type storm along the eastern seaboard, so keep in touch with us. Right now thirty-three and mostly cloudy in Central Park, humidity fifty-one percent, wind from the northwest at ten. Again the current temperature, thirty-three going up to thirty-six today. 
<br><br>Mostly sunny and cold today, going up to thirty-four, the real feel temperature this afternoon will be in the twenties. As a reference point, the real temperature right now is eleven. Clear and cold tonight, low twenty-six in midtown, fourteen in some suburbs. Tomorrow sunshine followed by clouds, high forty-two. Part one of a potential two-part storm would reach us on Friday, with some snow or rain arriving, high thirty-eight. The biggest part, assuming it develops, would be during the course of the weekend. We'll be very close to the snow-rain line and so it's impossible to estimate how much snow there could be, but it could be a disruptive storm throughout the region, in terms of travel, during the course of the weekend. Forty degrees our projected high, or thirty-eight on Saturday, and about the same on Sunday. Currently twenty-one degrees, relative humidity fifty-nine percent, wind west at eight miles per hour, twenty-one heading to thirty-four. 
<br><br>Fine weather for today, not much wind, the temperature rebounding from the recent chill, going to forty, thickening clouds tonight, low thirty-four. Now, we're predicting some snow spreading across the area between eight and noon tomorrow, then accumulating one to three inches along the coast, three to six inches inland. Does it have to happen? No. There are some indications the storm can weaken, never get here. We'll rate that about a one in four chance that nothing would actually happen tomorrow, but three out of four that something will, so we need to be ready for slippery places, and then a change to rain at the end of the day. Saturday, the storm will strengthen offshore, again, will it be close enough to the coast to give us a lot of snow and strong wind, or just offshore far enough that we don't get much precipitation at all? That is partly dependent on what happens to the first system. The high at that... Saturday, thirty-four, Sunday, an easier forecast, sunshine thirty-eight, Monday, sunshine thirty-six. Currently thirty-two degrees, relative humidity forty-nine percent, wind north at five, thirty-two heading for forty. 
<br><br>Well, we're continuing to watch snow sloat... spread slowly northward, uh, through New Jersey, uh, snowing around Trenton and, eh, Princeton, uh, not yet to Somerville, uh, or, a, to Belmar, but it probably begins there by about nine o'clock, uh, nine to ten o'clock into, uh, Manhattan by about noon. And then, a couple of hours after that, it'll spread across Long Island and into Connecticut. There can be rain mixed with the snow at times this afternoon and evening, but then the snow falls, uh, continuously later tonight, and into tomorrow morning, and we think we're gonna wind up with an average of three to six inches of snow across the metropolitan area with the, uh, six, perhaps, more favored than the three. And you go north and west of Interstate 287, there can be a foot of snow or more, before it tapers off later tomorrow. Right now thirty-three, just cloudy in Central Park, humidity eighty-eight percent, wind out of the northeast at nine. Again, the current temperature thirty-three, temperatures around freezing during the snow. 
<br><br>It is closing in again. Snowfall intensities picking up across the tri-state area, and we will have heavy snow through the, uh, day today and into, uh, part of tonight as well. The snowfall rates can be on the order of an inch, to even an inch to two inches per hour, on occasion. And, uh, we think by around midnight tonight, we'll have an average of twelve to eighteen inches of snow across the metropolitan area. And that does not include drifting, which is going to become more significant with time, because the wind will be picking up and, uh, that's the reason the blizzard warning is in effect. The combination of blowing snow and falling snow can create near visibilit... near zero visibilities on occasion. Twenty-five degrees and lightly snowing now, we're headed up to thirty in midtown. 
<br><br>Well, this storm winding down here as far as, uh, accumulating snow goes. Uh, there should be little accumulation from this point on and, uh, we will see, though, very strong winds continuing right on through the night. Uh, the center of this nor'easter only moving to about Cape Cod by morning, temperatures staying in the middle-twenties, uh, a lot of blowing and drifting in open areas. Uh, for tomorrow also very wind, cold, but, uh, we will see some sunshine returning, thirty-two in the afternoon. Monday a much more tranquil day, lots of sunshine, thirty-eight, mid-forties on Tuesday with sunshine. We may hit fifty on Wednesday as clouds come in ahead of the, uh, next frontal system, and that one will be delivering rain. In Central Park twenty-five degrees, light snow, we have a north wind twenty-five, gusting forty-five miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature twenty-five going down to twenty-three in midtown. 
<br><br>Well, our storm is over now, uh, all except for the melting which, uh, will begin a little bit this afternoon, then it'll freeze up tonight, with plenty of sun today, and temperatures getting above freezing this afternoon. There will be some melting, but tonight will be clear and cold, low twenty-six in the city, into the teens in the suburbs. Sunshine tomorrow, up to forty, that'll really start the melting. The problem is there'll be rain that comes along Wednesday afternoon and night, into part of Thursday, with temperatures getting into the forties, and that rain and thaw and melting snow could create some flooding problems Wednesday night and Thursday. Right now, twenty-five and, um, mostly clear in Central Park, humidity fifty-eight percent, wind northwest at seven. Again the current temperature twenty-five, going up to thirty-six. 
<br><br>Plenty of sunshine will be the rule, although at times there will be a deck of clouds that show up, so it's not going to be a totally sunny day, temperature today getting to about forty degrees. Partly to mostly cloudy tonight, low thirty-six in midtown, twenty-five to thirty in many of the colder suburbs. Then as we look at the day tomorrow, variable cloudiness, high forty-eight. Now, it's not out of the question if some drizzle breaks out early, as moist air comes in from the southeast, but rain will be with us tomorrow night, and that rain can be heavy. That, plus melting snow, can lead to flooding in, uh, poor drainage areas, lots of slush around. And Thursday afternoon, the rain's all gone, clouds breaking for sun, windy, high fifty-two. Then Friday partly sunny with a cold wind, high forty-six. Currently it's thirty-one and cloudy, relative humidity sixty-nine percent, winds out of the north at four miles per hour, thirty-one heading for forty. 
<br><br>Well, uh, back when we got the snowstorm over the weekend, that generated about two-thirds of an inch of liquid equivalent or, in other words, if it wasn't cold enough for snow, but had it rained, we would've had about two-thirds of an inch of rain. Now, uh, we're expecting just as much rain, if not a little more, maybe around an inch, Wednesday night and Thursday morning. So, with melting snow and, uh, just about as much if not more rain, well, you get the idea where I'm going with this. Uh, there will be, I think, areas of flooding, poor drainage areas, some side streets, uh, places with storm sewers that are clogged, and you're gonna have, uh, a little bit of flooding to deal with. There's one good thing about all this, it will be turning milder with temperatures later today in the mid-forties, holding nearly steady or rising Wednesday night, peaking at fifty-two Thursday, then we turn drier and colder again. Right now it's cloudy and thirty-seven, humidity seventy-two percent, the wind east at six miles per hour. Cloudy, thirty-seven, heading down to thirty-four. 
<br><br>Pretty nice day out there, of course the snow melting, it is slush and water, but variable cloudiness, high forty-eight. Overcast tonight into tomorrow morning with rain, it'll be heavy at times after midnight, with flooding in poor drainage areas, a combination of rain and melting snow likely to cause a mess for the morning commute, temperatures steady or rising overnight. Then later tomorrow, but not till after lunch, windy and mild, clouds may break for some sun, high fifty-two. Friday sunny with a cold wind, high forty-four, real feel temperature in the low thirties. Then for Saturday sunshine, high forty. Currently the winds are light and variable, the relative humidity sixty-five percent, forty-three degrees in midtown heading for forty-eight. 
<br><br>We are going to continue to get a wind-swept, heavy rain for at least the next few hours. Uh, we've had street and highway flooding that will continue to be an issue into the early afternoon, and that wind gusting to between thirty and forty miles an hour on occasion, making umbrellas hard to handle as well. At least it's mild, temperatures in the fifties. Late in the day it'll begin clearing up and turn colder. Tonight partly cloudy, blustery and cold, a low thirty-six. Sunshine tomorrow forty-four, sunshine on Saturday, cold, high thirty-eight, then clouding up Sunday, followed by the chance for some rain or snow. Fifty-six degrees and rainy now in Central Park, humidity one hundred percent, wind from the east gusting to twenty-seven miles an hour. Again, the current temperature fifty-six going up to fifty-nine today.
<br><br>Skies will be clearing out as we go through the night, uh, a gusty northwest wind will continue, and temperatures will be in the low thirties by daybreak. High pressure heading in our direction, uh, from, uh, south central Canada, uh, will bring us a good deal of sunshine here the next couple of days and, uh, chillier weather, mid-forties tomorrow, only upper thirties on Saturday. The next system we have to tangle with is currently dropping some rain down over Arizona. This will be, uh, spreading across Texas during the day tomorrow and the, uh, reach, eh, the rest of the Gulf states on the weekend, and start heading northeastward. Uh, we expect an increasing wind and, uh, uh, cloudy skies here on Sat... or Sunday, I should say, uh, with, uh, snow or sleet breaking out. Probably changing over to rain late in the day or during the evening, and that would continue on into Monday morning, high Sunday about thirty-six. We have forty-five degrees and a cloudy sky in Central Park, a northwest wind twenty-five, gusting forty to forty-five miles an hour. Repeating the current temperature forty-five going down to thirty-four in midtown. 
<br><br>Yesterday we had the teeming tarns, the rain, the flooding, warm air. Today, dry air, cold winds, and that's pretty much it, the high'll be forty-four, real feel temperature this afternoon in the low thirties. Partly cloudy to clear tonight, cold, winds diminishing early, low thirty in midtown, twenty-two to twenty-six most suburbs. Tomorrow, sunshine followed by cloudiness, high thirty-eight. Then it looks like a storm visits on Sunday, snow at first mixing with or changing to rain in the city, and elsewhere along the coast. Too early to tell whether there'll be any snow still on the ground at the end of the storm after the rain. In the northern and western suburbs, it may stay below freezing the whole time, and that could allow snow and ice with several inches accumulating. Monday the storm leaves, and it's dry into Tuesday. Currently, winds out of the west at ten, gusting to eighteen miles per hour, the relative humidity fifty-two percent, thirty-seven in midtown heading forty-four. 
<br><br>It'll be sunny to partly cloudy today, we'll have a high of thirty-eight degrees. Clouds increase, thicken and lower tonight, low falling back to thirty. Cloudy, increasingly windy, a cold day tomorrow, snow or sleet will begin during the morning hours. Pretty quick change over to rain in the afternoon, though, from New York City on to the southeast, one to three inches there. We... north of 180... um, 287, I should say, however, we'll see a mixture continue most of the day, could see three to six inches of ice and snow by the end of the day, with a high of thirty-six. Maybe a little rain or drizzle will start the day Monday, otherwise mostly cloudy with a high of forty. Mostly sunny, warmer Tuesday, high forty-six. Currently in Central Park, thirty degrees, relative humidity fifty-nine percent, and a west wind at six miles per hour. Repeating the current temperature thirty going up to thirty-eight in midtown. 
<br><br>Well, uh, the wind is in the process of diminishing this Monday night, and because of that, well, it's gonna be a lot, uh, more tranquil around here late tonight and tomorrow. It should be a fairly sunny day, the nicest day of the week actually. We're headed down to thirty in midtown, twenty-five in most suburbs, highs tomorrow in the mid-forties. Clouds will roll in, though, tomorrow night and this'll be followed by periods of rain on Wednesday, some of which can be heavy, that's not good news, a weekend storm, then by Wednesday it rains. That seems to be the pattern the last two weeks. It'll be very windy in the wake of the rain on Thursday, with clouds and sun, Friday, temperatures near forty. It's clear and thirty-four in midtown right now, the humidity sixty-seven percent, wind west at twelve miles per hour gusting to eighteen. It's clear, thirty-four heading down thirty. 
<br><br>A nice day today. Sunshine will take temperatures up into the forties, and it'll be mild tonight but it will also cloud up, with a low near forty. Tomorrow our next storm begins to bring us rain, and rain tomorrow, and on into tomorrow night, will be heavy at times, could get an inch of rain, and that'll produce street and highway flooding. Inland areas, uh, the ground is saturated, uh, there's snow on the ground to melt, the rivers are high, and there's concern about river and stream flooding. And, in fact, flood watches are in effect in western and northern suburbs, uh, for tomorrow and tomorrow night. Thursday, very windy, clouds break for some sun, maybe a few flurries around in the morning. Temperatures in the thirties and mostly sunny Friday, the high thirty-eight. Thirty-three and, uh, mostly sunny now in Central Park, humidity seventy-one percent, wind from the southwest at seven. Again, the current temperature thirty-three going up to forty-six today. 
<br><br>We've got rain west and north of the city. It will be raining, uh, by nine o'clock across most of the metropolitan area. The rain will be heavy and continue into this evening and street and highway flooding certainly can occur and, uh, with rivers and, uh, streams high in interior sections. There's also concern about that kind of flooding, and the flood watch is in effect for much of the area, our high today fifty-four. Turning windy and colder tonight, rain could end as a brief period of snow and flurries, the low thirty-four. Tomorrow partly sunny, very windy and cold, temperatures in the thirties. Partly sunny Friday, high thirty-eight, chance of flurries on Saturday. Right now it's fifty degrees and cloudy in Central Park, the rain still may be an hour or an hour and a half away, humidity one hundred percent, wind from the southeast at six. Again the current temperature fifty going up to fifty-four today. 
<br><br>Recently we've had storms every couple of days. One would be snow, one would be a mixture, one, like yesterday, would be all rain and wind. The big thing about the next five days is there aren't going to be any big storms, just cold, dry weather. Today's high thirty-nine, going down to thirty-two in midtown tonight, twenty-four in many suburbs, up to thirty-eight with some sun tomorrow, thirty-six on Saturday, maybe a flurry, Sunday partly sunny thirty-eight. Monday forty-two and we have time to, uh, make up some lost time on holiday shopping if, uh, any of those storms of previous weeks delayed you. Currently in midtown thirty-two degrees, relative humidity sixty percent, wind west at twelve, gusting to twenty, thirty-two heading to thirty-nine. 
<br><br>It looks like a fine weekend and, for outdoor activities, no problems. You can go skiing, go shopping, go nowhere, but the weather's going to be decent. We don't see any storms coming before Tuesday or Wednesday. For today, a mixture of clouds and sun, going to thirty-six. Partly cloudy tonight, low twenty-eight in midtown, twenty-two in some suburbs. Tomorrow, cloudy to partly sunny, brisk and cold, a flurry possibility, high thirty-six. Sunday, partly sunny, high thirty-six. Monday, not as cold, going to forty-six, and up to forty-eight, as clouds increase on Tuesday. Currently winds out of the west at five, relative humidity sixty-nine percent, thirty degrees in midtown heading for thirty-six. 
<br><br>Well, it looks like a quiet weekend if you're headed out to do some last-minute shopping for the holidays. You'll find cloudy to partly sunny skies, it'll be brisk and cold, with a stray flurry, and a high thirty-eight. Partly cloudy, cold tonight, down to twenty-five in midtown, twenty in the suburbs. Remember, tomorrow is the shortest day of the year, so we'll see times of sun and clouds, still cold, the high again tomorrow only thirty-eight. And we warm up on Monday, it'll be partly sunny with a high of forty-six. Increasing clouds on Tuesday, a high up to fifty, for Christmas Eve, windy with a chance for rain. Right now we have a temperature of thirty in Morristown, it's twenty-eight at Islip, and it's clear and thirty in Central Park, eighty percent humidity, a west wind at five. Thirty right now, headed up to thirty-eight this afternoon.
