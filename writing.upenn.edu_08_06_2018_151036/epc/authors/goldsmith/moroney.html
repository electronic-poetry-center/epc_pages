<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You can only dislike
what you can&#8217;t ignore, and for this reason it&#8217;s often helpful to
find out who dislikes an artist&#8217;s work in order to find out how famous it
has become.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One story involving
Kenneth Goldsmith has a Stanford Professor and an English department secretary
in an elevator, discussing Goldsmith&#8217;s reading of his book <i>No. 111
2.7.93-10.20.96</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> at the Stanford
Bookstore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The department
secretary asked the professor what he thought of the poetry reading.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The professor
replied, &quot;What poetry reading?&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Professor was a
traditionalist, but there are those within the avant-garde who have equal
doubts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another Professor, an
avant-garde poet who teaches at Bard College, said of Goldsmith, &quot;There
are two kinds of reservations you can have about a work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There&#8217;s the sort you have after a
hard and careful reading of a work, and the sort you have that makes you not
want to read the work in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have the second sort for Goldsmith&#8217;s work, so I don&#8217;t know
how much help I can be.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kenneth
Goldsmith is no longer a Young Artist, and, even if his work is difficult,
he&#8217;s too old to be an enfant terrible.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He is about to turn forty and just had a baby with his wife,
video artist Cheryl Donegan. His hair used to be shoulder-length; now it is razor-short.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The clothes he wears were once worn for
style but have now perhaps become favorite items that can&#8217;t be thrown
away, a favorite black ska-style hat and a favorite faded denim jacket.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He started out as a sculptor in the
late 80s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He worked for Allan
McCollum, and soon made a name for himself with a series of large, crafted,
conceptual sculptures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Art and
Auction magazine picked him out in 1993 as one of &quot;Ten Artists for the
Nineties.&quot; Over the nineties, however, his obsession with language has
turned him his focus to writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No. <i>111
2.7.93-10.20.96</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> is his most
successful book so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
2.7.39-10.20.96 refer to the dates he spent collecting all the phrases that he
heard, wrote, or read that ended in an &quot;er&quot; sound.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He then arranged the phrases as a
rhyming dictionary would, with one-syllable phrases in alphabetical order in
the first chapter, and two-syllable phrases in the second. It begins &quot;A,
a, aar, aas, aer, agh, ah, air&quot; and ends with the 7,228 syllables of a
D.H. Lawrence short story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The book has become
a popular with students, and Goldsmith receives fan mail from High School students
who&#8217;ve read the book online.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the universities the book has also found success.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I&#8217;ve had several students
become absolutely obsessed with the book,&quot; said Craig Dworkin, Associate
Professor of English at Princeton University, &quot;one of whom wrote love
letters to Kenny and another is writing a dramatization of the book for
performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those skeptical of
the avant-garde in general, and of language poetry or oulipo or procedural work
in particular, again and again show enthusiasm for the work.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goldsmith has
produced a CD with vocalist Joan La Barbara, designed a dress for Vogue
magazine, written music criticism, dealt cocaine, worked as a carpenter, edited
a poetry web site, and DJ&#8217;d on the radio.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He is something of a Renaissance figure, which is fine.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the Renaissance was four centuries
ago, and the New York cultural, despite producing figures like John Cage and
Jackson Mac Low, still doesn&#8217;t know what to make of a song, poem and art
man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kenneth Goldsmith
was born in 1961 and grew up with his parents, Ted and Judy, in the Long Island
suburb of Port Washington.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ted Goldsmith had
been forced by his father to take over the family business, Bromley Coats, and,
having &quot;slept-walked through the sixties,&quot; according to Goldsmith,
Ted fell into the New Age movements of the 1970s to cope with the tedium.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With his wife Judy,
Ted attended a variety of seminars and meetings, including the Erhard Seminars
Training, or est (Latin for 'it is&#8217;).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He would have sat in a room for 60 hours while est staffers
would make him scream, cry, and beg until he &quot;Got it.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The est bathroom breaks were famously
few and far between.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those who
couldn&#8217;t last and wet themselves would be humiliated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the
humiliation and degradation, all social barriers between Ted and himself would
have been destroyed, and in the ruins of society&#8217;s rituals the inner
light of Ted&#8217;s self would remain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At least this was the opinion of Werner Erhard, the movement&#8217;s
founder, who fled the US in 1991 after a series of lawsuits charging him with
brainwashing and tax evasion. Goldsmith
also remembers a time when his father arrived back from a Silva Mind Control
seminar in Texas and told his children that the family would never have to stop
for a traffic light again. He could now turn red lights green and took his
children for a ride to prove it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the first traffic light changed, Kenny and his sister cheered.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They cheered again when it happened the
second time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the third light
remained red, and Ted Goldsmith had to stop.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;It looked like we&#8217;d be stopping for red lights
for the foreseeable future,&quot; wrote Goldsmith in No. 111. Ted and Judy made
sure that Kenny went to a holistic doctor, ate vegetarian food, and performed
transcendental meditation twice a day. Kenny had his bar mitzvah at the age of
16 next to the Wailing Wall, although this in no way demonstrates a deeply
religious Judaism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ted was what
Goldsmith calls a secular, Bagels-and-Lox Jew, and he thought that it would be
amusing, having talked to a rabbi on the way to a family vacation in Israel, if
Kenny had his bar mitzvah while they were there.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Goldsmith disliked growing up in Port Washington.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In one of his works, part of an
exhibition entitled 'Too Jewish,&#8217; Goldsmith shows himself surrounded by
pennies, a reference to the Port Washington High School children who used to
pelt him with coins in the hallways.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For survival, he
skipped most classes and turned to sex, drugs and architecture.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I liked the lines and the
thinking behind it,&quot; said Goldsmith of his architecture class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;And really, I&#8217;ve never
given it up. A work like 111 was highly architectural, highly dependent on
structure.&quot; He had to give up architecture when his teacher, a former
Marine, caught Goldsmith smoking pot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Goldsmith says he spent his last year in High School permanently high
and in art class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After High School,
he spent five years at three colleges, graduating with a B.F.A. from the Rhode
Island School of Design in 1984.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three of
Goldsmith&#8217;s latest works appear to be blank frames at first, but on
closer inspection are filled with tiny punctuation marks.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One has all the punctuation from the
punctuation chapter in Strunk and White&#8217;s Elements of Style; another the
punctuation from Gertrude Stein&#8217;s essay on punctuation; and the third,
all the punctuation from Molly Bloom&#8217;s soliloquy at the end of Ulysses: a
few hyphens and a period. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
Goldsmith&#8217;s involvement with the art world, he mentions very few artists
as influences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He most frequently
mentions John Cage as an influence and, apart from that, talks mainly of
conceptual artists, especially the Fluxus artists of the 60s, and like those
artists the idea behind the work is as important as the work itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I&#8217;m very
interested in trying to make these ephemeral things concrete and lasting,&quot;
he says.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But as for the work
itself, its form and its composition he usually has little to say, and depends on
two phrases to describe nearly all his work. That the work was beautiful. That
the work sold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goldsmith dates the
start of his maturity as an artist to 1987, a time when it seemed that it was
the artists turn to become rich and famous. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;There
was this notion of an artist being a celebrity,&quot; said John Lee, who now
represents Goldsmith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I was making
luscious, sensuous objects that sold for a lot of money. And everything sold,
it was remarkable,&quot; said Goldsmith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;It was very seductive selling things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a Saki story
about an artist who gets stuck making landscape paintings of cows.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As long as there are cows in the
painting the paintings sold, but as soon as he tried anything else, the
paintings failed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For Goldsmith it
was books.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For three years he
made large wooden books.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He made
books with his life expectancy (1962-2028) on them called
&quot;Expectancy.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He made
two books that looked like Abbie Hoffman&#8217;s <i>Steal This Book</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One was
made of lead and weighed 300 lbs., the other was seven feet tall and
couldn&#8217;t even be taken out of Goldsmith&#8217;s loft.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither could be stolen.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He shone a bright
light out of a book with the word &quot;Truth&quot; carved out of its front and
called it &quot;The Blinding Truth.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He did a series of books based on Harold Bloom&#8217;s <i>The Anxiety of
Influence</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;But what began
to happen was that I began to make the same object over and over again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The books were always the same
size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was really<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>interested in the writing on
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But people would say, 'Look,
why do<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>you keep making the same
object over and over?&#8217;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I
was like, &#8216;Well<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>it&#8217;s the language that
changes with each book.&#8217;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
realized I couldn&#8217;t do<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>that any more.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The artistic crisis
coincided with two financial ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Donegan and Goldsmith had bought a loft on Avenue C and sunk all the
money from their marriage into it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The man who sold the apartment made off with the money, and the bank
repossessed the apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And as
the art market went into recession, Goldsmith lost a highly lucrative job as
artist Allan McCollum&#8217;s workshop manager. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He still enjoys
selling his work, however.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

most dramatic break with the art world, and the start of his pursuit of
writing, came in 1995, when he displayed <i>No. 109</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It
was a very negative experience for me,&quot; said John Lee, who exhibited the
work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Not because of the
work itself but because of Kenny&#8217;s reaction to the response.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was as if he was repudiating the
confidence and enthusiasm we had in him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was like a tantrum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
suppose I&#8217;m really getting back at him now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The gallery system is great when it&#8217;s working for you,
but like any system, when it fails you, you feel very bitter.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goldsmith remembers
it this way, &quot;I said Fuck You.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If you can&#8217;t handle my language then you can Fuck yourself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just thought I&#8217;d be out of the
art world forever.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time
Goldsmith considered <i>No. 109</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> to be
his most ambitious work yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
still considered himself a sculptor or, as he put it in the preface to another
work, &quot;a text-based artist.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since he&#8217;d lost his apartment and his job he&#8217;d been making
seven-foot white slabs, half-white, half-filled with text.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The works looked spartan but the
language could be obscene, funny, and nasty.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been amazed at the crazy associations that happened
in a rhyming dictionary, Goldsmith started to do the same with his work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a few initial attempts with words
ending in &quot;oo&quot; and &quot;oh&quot; he made <i>No. 105</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>, a triptych of slabs and then decided that the amount
of language might warrant a small book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the preface he wrote, &quot;This is a first attempt to transform <i>No.
105</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>, once a visual artwork into a
poetry book format.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>No. 109</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> was even larger.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It took up nine panels -- a triptych of triptychs -- and
leaned against the entire length of the gallery&#8217;s walls. According to
Goldsmith, people walked into the gallery, took half a look at all the words
and walked out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It was too
much,&quot; said Goldsmith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;The art world had been so supportive until then.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But they couldn&#8217;t handle the
language.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The gallery sold one
slab to a collector. Goldsmith fell into a depression.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three years later Goldsmith returned to
the gallery and installed Soliloquy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>By that time <i>No. 111</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> had
been published and Goldsmith had a new confidence with language.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had recorded all the words he said
in a week on a hidden microphone and pasted the results on the gallery
walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was, he says, his Fuck
You to the art world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The New York
Times called it &quot;a revealing, funny, irritating, and exhausting work of
something.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goldsmith
has entered into poetry through the art gallery, which has made things somewhat
awkward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What makes him
so interesting,&quot; says Marjorie Perloff, who recently retired from teaching
at Stanford University &quot;is that he doesn&#8217;t come from creative
writing workshops in Universities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He&#8217;s approaching language as an artist.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perloff
is one of the most respected advocates of avant-garde poetry and, like many of
the avant-garde, feels that the avant-garde in poetry has been passed by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It only takes
Perloff ten minutes to start complaining about the scant attention that
innovative poetry has received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I mean let&#8217;s take architecture.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone doesn&#8217;t have to be in the avant-garde to go to
Bilbao and appreciate the Guggenheim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There&#8217;s very little doubt that Frank Gehry is a major figure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But in poetry it&#8217;s not really
clear who are the major twentieth century figures.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There&#8217;s Berryman, Lowell, Frost and across the
Atlantic there&#8217;s Heaney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
Heaney is just another W.B. Yeats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I admire Yeats very much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;ve written a lot about him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But we&#8217;ve already had him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We don&#8217;t need him again.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And then there&#8217;s someone like Pinsky who uses this
strange journalistic discourse in his poems. I mean they&#8217;re very nice and
easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I don&#8217;t know what
they are, they&#8217;re certainly not poems.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perloff has been
making these sort of complaints for decades.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1981 she wrote in an essay on John Cage (which could
equally apply to Goldsmith twenty years later):<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;It may seem easy to talk into a tape recorder and then
transcribe one&#8217;s words, avoiding all margins and leaving blank spaces
between word groups. Yet we don&#8217;t in fact do it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For what is really &#8216;easy,&#8217;
in the context of the present, is to write little epiphany poems in free verse,
detailing a meaningful experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am walking, let us say, in the snow, and I notice strange footprints:
I am reminded of the day when&#8230;&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What Goldsmith
represents for Perloff, in contrast to poets like Robert Pinsky, is
Goldsmith&#8217;s attempt to use language for purposes other than creating an
image and an emotional response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For the poets who wrote in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry journal in the early 80s, poets like Heaney
represented a capitalistic promise of meaning in return for words and Goldsmith,
who has made friends with L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets like Bruce Andrews, has similar
feelings. &quot;This country has no capacity for abstraction,&quot; he
says.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I think that everybody
thinks of language in this nation as an exchange.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Like when you buy something, you get the product and you
don&#8217;t even notice the person behind the counter who sold it to you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And with language you don&#8217;t even
notice the words, you just look at the meaning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goldsmith likes to
talk about a White Hot Center that consumes our culture&#8217;s middle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Artists get drawn to the White Hot
Center and then disappear into it, helping the White Hot Center pump out
language. Words appear on airplanes, billboards, buses, building tops, car
bumpers, clothes, hats, the radio, the television, the newspaper and in
conversation. Goldsmith
once wrote, &quot;If every word spoken in New York City daily were somehow to
materialize as a snowflake, each day there would be a blizzard.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Works like <i>No.
111</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> and <i>6799</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> (a book which contains Goldsmith&#8217;s entire
record collection) make words, which would otherwise have disappeared, become
solid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time he
finds absurdity; even his most austere projects have a sense of humor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Fidget</i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>, for instance, was Goldsmith&#8217;s attempt to
record every movement his body made for a day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Within hours he was going insane.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He masturbated, picked his nose, tried to go to sleep, and
then drank a bottle of Jack Daniels and slurred so horribly for the last hour
that Goldsmith gave up transcribing what he had said and just printed the first
chapter backwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While the idea
of the book is austere, Goldsmith&#8217;s extreme response and his dutiful
recording of it can be quite funny to read. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He
lacks a lot of the dullness which plagues artists working with text,&quot; said
John Lee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;There&#8217;s a
light-hearted quality to his work.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goldsmith feels that
once <i>Soliloquy</i></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> is published
he&#8217;ll be satisfied to have made five books that are entirely unique and
which might encourage others to experiment as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He thinks that he might have done all he can do with books. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
