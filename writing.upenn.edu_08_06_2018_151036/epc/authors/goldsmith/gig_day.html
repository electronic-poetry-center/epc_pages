Initially there's something 
ravishing about the retrograde qualities of 
<I>Day</I>, Kenneth Goldsmith's latest sportive foray into "extreme 
writing." From now on, whenever I get my poor old dial-up ass kicked 
by some bells-and-whistles web site and have to concede the peculiarly 
ignominious defeat that comes with clicking "text only version," I shall 
be consoled by this book: by its fantastic solid weight, the bravura 
relentlessness of its plain-text content and appearance.</P>
For 
the uninitiated, <I>Day </I>is both an 800-plus pager and a one-liner: 
it's the <I>New York Times</I> of 1 September 2000 retyped, all six 
sections from cover to cover. One size fits all, from headlines ("Bush 
Ad Mocks Gore Character") to the smallest print in the small ads ("Other 
conditions may apply"). This cavalcade of human life - from Wal-Mart 
to NAMBLA via Keanu Reeves - all goes past in a fixed point size that, 
save for the odd dim vestige, collapses all hierarchies and disables 
the sophisticated apparatus of contradistinction that allows any newspaper 
normally to roll out in the morning rather slimmer than Richardson's<I> 
Clarissa.</I></P>
Goldsmith 
compounds these promotions and reversals with rigorous obedience to 
a procedural logic in translating layout, leading to some vertiginously 
bathetic interruptions - of news reports (mid-sentence) by advertising 
copy, say. Everyone will have their favourites; I'm very fond of:</P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>Mr. 
Cheney spent most of his career in government, but the arrival of the 
Clinton administration left him very</P></UL></UL></UL>
<UL><UL><UL><P>They 
also toil who very</P></UL></UL></UL>
<UL><UL><UL><P>fluff 
the carpets.very</P></UL></UL></UL>
while other juxtapositions 
seem like mordantly satirical derangements: "A great gift idea! / British 
Begin Human Testing of H.I.V. Vaccine"; or too-good-to-be-accidental 
pinpoints of wordplay: "Despite an unusual two-year suspen- / Continued 
on Page D5."</P>
In 
the context of these daunting slabs of cosmetically uniform prose, the 
reader falls gladly on the "found poems" into which advertisements, 
weather reports and arts listings are alchemised. Viewed more coolly, 
though, aren't such incidents the very least we can expect from this 
project? For example, United Airlines' statement regarding its negotiations 
with pilots who have been working to rule over a pay dispute, beginning</P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>A first, but very</P></UL></UL></UL>
<UL><UL><UL><P>important step in the</P></UL></UL></UL>
<UL><UL><UL><P>right direction.</P></UL></UL></UL>
happens to be, throughout, 
beautifully and delicately lineated - certainly a better and more sensitively 
written poem than anything yet contrived by Britain's laureate. But 
our response to it tells us next to nothing new or useful about how 
we read, and nothing progressive about the specific classification of 
poetry, about the conventions that indicate it and the covenants that 
underlie it.</P>
<I>Day</I> 
is not, then, "about" literary or informational frames and their apprehension 
and transgression. Presumably if it were, we would be left alone with 
the book, to read and re-read, to play and to argue among ourselves. 
As it is, this work arrives glossed to within an inch of its life: located 
- on its back cover - in a number of strikingly dissimilar traditions 
(somewhat disingenuously grouped around "appropriation") and situated 
in relation to so many big droppable names it's not so much a blurb 
as an Academy Awards acceptance speech.</P>
One 
might normally try, at least, to disregard such fulsomeness; but 
<I>Day</I> is, for all its incidental pleasures, itself an inert lump 
of a thing: so one can't help but be interested in what Goldsmith appears 
to think this book is <I>for</I>, aside from its function as a record 
of a weird, half-macho half-geeky, virtuosity (a New York intellectual 
counterpart, if you will, to the Young British Autists of list-fixated 
"bloke lit").</P>
To 
some readers and commentators, it has been enough to note Goldsmith's 
training and activity as a fine artist - particularly as a sculptor; 
<I>Day</I> is, they aver, an object, or 
<I>objet,</I> and, as such, self-sufficient. Well, certainly the awesome 
and sensational transcription of NASDAQ prices - running across nineteen 
pages and previously issued separately as a chapbook - is a materially 
substantial and aesthetically compelling interlude (though, while it's 
notable that the business section clocks in at a whopping 253 pages, 
I was more astonished and encouraged to find that the arts section - 
albeit on a Friday - is exactly the same length). But where some other 
recent seminal works of transcriptual text art, such as Fiona Banner's 
"Top Gun" (1995) and her 1000-page volume 
<I>THE NAM </I>(1997 - "not so much a coffee table book as a coffee 
table"), or Emma Kay's "Worldview" (1999), allow for some limited subjective 
inflexion by routing the process through description or recall, leaving 
us daunted not just by the physical scale or size of their works but 
by the unravelling of perception and cognition they describe, Goldsmith's 
absolute determination to minimise the betrayal of his own presence 
within the laborious manufacture of this text leaves 
<I>Day</I> curiously remote: we get both sculpture and pedestal, all 
in one. But what is the nature, and the final import, of that remoteness?</P>
The 
ambivalence that I have begun to feel about this work is, I think, seeded 
in that blurb: <I>Day </I>is, it says here, "a monument to the ephemeral 
. . . a fleeting moment concretized." I find, in trying as ever to understand 
how writers and artists may participate in a wider cultural argument, 
a tension currently in the idea of the monument. On the one hand, all 
"concrete" monuments seem now to reach back only as far as a relatively 
recent fault; at present they are unable to commemorate anything more 
than a prior belief, now largely vacated, in the capacity of fixity 
and likeness to concentrate and summarise locally a particular trend 
in the distribution of social and political capital. They are all, even 
those yet to be built, "out of date": the intention behind them puts 
them there. On the other hand, the idea of memorial as a storage device 
for usable information remains vibrant and suasive. Picking up 
<I>Day</I> for the first time I immediately recalled the counsel of 
the celebrated folksinger and IWW poster-gramps, U. Utah Phillips: "I 
can go outside and pick up a rock that's older than the oldest song 
you know, bring it back in here and drop it on your foot. Now the past 
didn't go anywhere, did it?"</P>
The 
uncomfortable circumstance within <I>Day</I> is that Goldsmith's levelling 
(apparently with the best utopian intentions) of text size and typeface, 
his disinterested deletion of photos and graphics, his dismantling of 
the architectonic features of the newspaper sheet - all of these taken 
together effectually withdraw also the principal 
<I>mnemonic</I> technologies that potentiate the legibility and utility 
of the <I>Times.</I> There are certainly pertinent questions to be asked: 
whose technologies are those? Who controls the contents of popular memory, 
and to whom are they accountable? But in uncoupling the monumental from 
the memorable, does <I>Day</I> not explicitly act out the refusal to 
contain and endorse those questions, let alone pursue possible answers?</P>
Goldsmith 
has previously indicated, in an interview for 
<I>zingmagazine,</I> his anxiety about the role memory might play in 
weakening, rather than enriching, reception processes. Discussing "openness" 
in art, Goldsmith more or less elides "memory" and "nostalgia"; while 
this may seem over-hasty or careless, it mirrors (for example) Morton 
Feldman's acute concern regarding the way in which memory stokes a stupefying 
familiarity: as he famously notes in "Crippled Symmetry": "What Western 
musical forms have become is a paraphrase of memory."</P>
Fair 
enough: but in the particular context of 
<I>Day</I>, a designated monument apparently loaded in opposition to 
functional memory (not just its merely decorative or propagandistic 
outputs), we come back to re-stating our earlier question: what is this 
book, this monument, this concrete moment, for?</P>
There 
is something further disarming - intentionally so - about Goldsmith's 
invocation (in his blurb) of "uncreativity": that is, process-driven 
work wherein the artist's utmost challenge is to resist the temptation 
to intervene. His (brilliant and fascinating) previous archive works 
have been shaped in part by editing choices - such as the deliberate 
inclusion of D.H. Lawrence's short story "The Rocking-Horse Winner," 
sampled whole, as the concluding entry in 
<I>No. 111 2.7.93-10.20.96</I> - or the gradual intrusion of an implied 
narrative into <I>Fidget,</I> when the process proved to be so uncongenial 
to Goldsmith that he got blind drunk towards the end of it, a telling 
feedback loop that changed the work as it was being made. Here there 
is no obvious sign within the eventual work of the artist responding 
to the process. That doubling of restraint might seem present in the 
book, to some readers, as a trace of implied tension or a thread of 
unspeakable anxiety (which can only resonate impressively within a textual 
rendering of a pre-9/11 <I>camera obscura</I>); 
<I>Day</I> could even be seen as a coolly executed kidnapping and holding 
to ransom of a whole ethical narrative around self-sacrifice and (broadly) 
moral obligation, values that previously might have obtained in an arguably 
religiose discourse of "public service" - manifestly an equal and opposite 
kidnapping to that of "national interest" and patriotic duty, forcefully 
accelerated by the Bush administration since the WTC attacks.</P>
Taken, 
however, in the context of Goldsmith's most powerful achievement to 
date - the massive online resource base UbuWeb (at ubu.com) - 
<I>Day</I> seems to emblematize a less bracing and altogether more introverted 
conservatism. If <I>Day</I> is, as we are told it is, above all a monument 
(which in this particular case, I would argue, means not much more in 
the end than "a big book"), and moreover a monumental act of "uncreativity," 
we are left, ultimately, holding the product of a desire, systematically 
expressed, to <I>confiscate.</I> Every copy of 
<I>Day</I> - and there are 750 such in the world - is a ream of paper 
defused, a kilo of blank sheets (each the primed index of an unmanageable 
wealth of possibilities) decommissioned. 
<I>Day</I> uses the built-in prolificacy of rigorously constrained, 
task-based art to create a massive and exemplary statement in support 
of Dorothy Parker's rather more succinctly articulated fear (in "A Well-Worn 
Story"): that she can but "spoil a page with rhymes."</P>
Goldsmith's 
unparalleled eminence as the Howard Hughes 
<I>de nos cirque, </I>the grand master of self-storage - the cannibal 
to be weighed against so many starving artists - is not by any means 
to be despised. It speaks of a huge, and presumably inevitable, buckling 
of confidence in everything <I>Day</I> can be taken to reject: particularly, 
the possibility of specific, authored assertion, as a token of participation 
in a wider conversation about value and about the vulnerability of both 
conviction and evidence. Though their effects are quite different, and 
there is little to be said in opposition to the latter, both Goldsmith's<I> </I>
textual archives <I>in extremis,</I> such as 
<I>Day, </I>and the UbuWeb project are exercises in the marshalling 
of collateral. If nostalgia is - and we know it is - a kind of homesickness, 
<I>Day</I> properly avoids it, as Goldsmith insists we must: but replaces 
it instead with agoraphobia. The lesser evil, it seems, is to not leave 
home in the first place. The larder is full and the TV's on: so, where 
do you want to go today, and why the hell would you risk it?</P>
This 
isn't just Goldsmith's thing. Though they oppose each other's ritual 
encodings of the exchange value of remembrance, 
<I>Day</I> and UbuWeb are both museums of a kind (though there's a delightful 
paradox in Goldsmith's use of the web - all flux and mutability - to 
store information, and the book to disorient it: he's worshipping at 
the bazaar and filling the cathedral with bric-a-brac). The point is, 
especially here in Britain, we know how closely over the last 250 years 
the periodic upsurges in museum culture and activity, and their corollary 
pursuits of programmatic acquisition and taxonomy, mirror contemporaneous 
spells of political disquiet and social neurosis especially to do with 
imperial control, theological doctrine and scriptural authority, epidemic 
disease, and, quite variously, the domestic experience of foreignness. 
The museum is an enormous controlled and insulated environment for thinking 
about difference; as such it is ideologically complicated (to say the 
least) but not irretrievably distorted or facetious.</P>
Viewed 
in this way, there is something distinctly millenarian about 
<I>Day:</I> and of course, strictly speaking, the year 2000 is, like, 
<I>so</I> last millennium. Perhaps this book is really an acutely timely, 
tight-lipped panoptic survey of a Western tradition in which, most lately, 
eschatological and teleological ends have been first conflated and then 
levelled and reduced to clear. Maybe, though, if such a jumble of vaguely 
apocalyptic narratives seems absurdly mismatched to the genial bureaucratic 
<I>carnevale</I> (or, we might say, McGoodbye) of 
<I>Day,</I> we might at least consider it as a classic 
<I>fin de siècle </I>stigma, a last-gasp recapitulation of one of the 
old century's most hummable themes: that there's more nutrition in the 
carton than the burger; that (to your audience, as to your analyst) 
the throwaway line reveals more than the sweated sestina; that the very 
last thing you want to do with the trash is, God help us, 
<I>take it out.</I></P>
Still, 
where an inveterate garbage-botherer such as, oh, let's say, J. H. Prynne 
will eventually - as in Svankmajer's riffs on Archimbaldo - reanimate 
that rubbish, electively intervening again and again to choreograph 
its fractional divulgences, Goldsmith merely and hygienically reframes, 
re-bounds, all the crap and the crises of yesterday's news. And if "merely" 
seems unfair, given the desk-work that went into the production of the 
manuscript: well, there, perhaps, is my beef.</P>
<P>
At 
the end of the <I>Day,</I> Kenneth Goldsmith - a truly popular, distinctive 
and increasingly distinguished artist - has not just gone "beyond the 
call" (his apparent vocation); he's wound up 
<I>behind </I>it. While, as he knows and his blurb demonstrates, "uncreative" 
appropriation is now recognisably an established and honourable artistic 
tradition, it is obviously not, as a practice, equally honourable all 
the time. </P>
I've 
written elsewhere about a web-published response to the terrorist attacks 
of September 11th 2001 by Goldsmith's "extreme" ally Brian Kim Stefans, 
noting in his comments a tentative but palpably urgent desire for bodily 
presence and personal statement, as opposed to the ironic seclusion 
of the virtual. In this context, what I still like most about 
<I>Day</I> is what I liked from the start: it's a book. You can hold 
it in your hand and feel the weight of events; you can't swat flies 
with this newspaper, but you can stun an ox. </P>
What 
I dislike, what makes me wince, is the time it took Goldsmith away from 
us - just like I winced at that taunting sing-song Chumbawamba refrain 
a few years ago: <I>pissing the night away . . .</I> At this critical 
and complex time when we need every visionary artist we can gather, 
on the ground, listening in, paying attention, bringing us 
<I>tomorrow's</I> news (from nowhere, from everywhere) and telling it 
to us straight, it seems a matter of certain regret that someone of 
Goldsmith's intelligence and perspicacity should choose to absent himself, 
re-staging instead old art battles that were won long ago and once and 
for all. Perhaps it's crass to want to ask an artist of Jewish provenance 
such as Goldsmith about the momenta of appropriation projects in a broader 
context; but we have to be able to put those questions to each other, 
respectfully and in friendship: an artistic temperament is not a doctor's 
note, it never was. Ultimately, <I>Day</I> is, 
<I>pace</I> Nauman, more real fun than funeral; "out of date" in several 
ways, it's a one-line novelty in the form of an 800-page novel, and 
as such, plainly harmless: but harmlessness is not, right now, is it?, 
a sufficient aspiration.</P>
