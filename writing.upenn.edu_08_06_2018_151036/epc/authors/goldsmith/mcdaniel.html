<P><b>1.</b></P>
<P>There 
exists an old Situationist dream: the concept of a book bound in sandpaper, 
that when placed or removed from a bookcase contributes to the destruction 
of the books between which it is shelved.  It's hardly the model of 
poetic community, but an experimental impulse is also often a corrective 
one; an almost moral sense that what has been done ought to be undone, 
or at least done <I>less</I>. So nested in this fanciful suggestion 
rests a radical ambition: that within the trappings and tropes of literature's 
conventions lies the means by which writing itself may be utterly reconfigured, 
at the expense of the previous configurations whose terms both delimit 
and invite the possibilities of dramatic restructuring.  Both despite 
and due to his origins as a fine artist, Kenneth Goldsmith's commitment 
to "uncreativity" realizes the Situationist project and invigorates 
<I>art</I> by striking directly at 
<I>artifice</I>.  What distinguishes Goldsmith from his forerunners 
- Dadaists, Situationists, Concrete poets, Fluxus adventurers and Oulipo 
madmen - is his commitment to literalize - to make fully manifest -- 
the idea of literal-mindedness, and thereby "purge" his art of the creative 
impulse which each of the above movements identified as the specter 
by which art is haunted.&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P>It 
is the literal-mindedness that suggests the most useful entrance to 
Goldsmith's work.  Literal-mindedness, of course, is easily confused 
with simplicity - a state that is itself subject to grievous misapprehension.  
Otherwise astute observers of Goldsmith's writing rely upon the apparent 
simplicity of his methods: in their respective reviews of 
<I>Day</I>, Lucy Raven and Brian Kim Stefans note "This discrepancy 
between the simple idea and its dictionary-size manifestation marks 
the fulcrum of <I>Day's</I> complexity" and that "Kenneth Goldsmith 
has made a career out of creating, through masochistically tortuous 
writing practices, impossibly long, but very simply conceived books 
that follow through to the bitter end on some writing tick." While each 
comment correctly identifies the conceptual elegance of Goldsmith's 
formal parameters, we will initially examine the relationship between 
simplicity or literal-mindedness and the hint of pathology implied by 
"masochistically tortuous writing" that bespeaks "some ... tick."  In 
short, we will address the frequency and ease with which Goldsmith's 
practice evokes the language and aura of psychological disorder, especially 
the wavelength of the spectrum of autism syndromes now identified as 
Asperger's Disorder.  &nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P>The 
most recent edition of the <I>Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders</I><I> </I>
characterizes the diagnostic criteria for 299.80, Asperger's Disorder, 
as follows:&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<blockquote>
<P>A. Qualitative impairment in social interaction, 
as manifested by at least two of the following: 
<OL TYPE="1">
  <LI>marked 
  impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye 
  gaze, facial _expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social 
  interaction </LI>
  <LI>failure 
  to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level </LI>
  <LI>a 
  lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements 
  with other people (e.g. by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing 
  out objects of interest to other people) </LI>
  <LI>lack 
  of social or emotional reciprocity </LI>
</OL>
<P>B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped 
patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at 
least one of the following: 
<OL TYPE="1">
  <LI>encompassing 
  preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of 
  interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus </LI>
  <LI>apparently 
  inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals </LI>
  <LI>stereotyped 
  and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, 
  or complex whole-body movements) </LI>
  <LI>persistent 
  preoccupation with parts of objects </LI>
</OL>
</blockquote><br>
<P>We 
must of course be cautious when we apply diagnostic criteria originally 
designed for one sphere to a completely unrelated area; this caution 
is necessarily compounded when the criteria at hand are originally meant 
to address medical and psychological conditions widely perceived as 
liabilities in important areas of social functioning.  Yet the urge 
to rely upon psychological descriptors is not an accidental one, and 
useful still if we maintain strict efforts to avoid pathologizing the 
objects to which we turn medical and psychological descriptors. And 
it is also worth noting that psychological diagnoses are themselves 
not static, are equally subject to potential abuse and potential evolution.  
It is particularly useful to consider the evolution of the spectrum 
of conditions now known collectively as autism, the general category 
into which Asperger's falls. Once we regarded autism syndrome behaviors 
as the likely result of insufficient and/or inappropriate maternal attention, 
and institutionalized individuals who demonstrated those behaviors.  
But we now perceive these behaviors with a far greater degree of subtlety 
as regards both their origins and their consequences, and it is this 
more sophisticated imagination that lends itself to an examination of 
Kenneth Goldsmith's "uncreative practice" and non-interventionist writing.  
The most telling shift in our collective imagination is exemplified 
by the following specification of Asperger's, that "There is no clinically 
significant general delay in cognitive development or in... adaptive behavior... 
and curiosity about the environment."</P>
<P>This 
is a critical and relatively recent acknowledgement for the American 
Psychological Association to make, that Asperger's children and other 
persons who display certain autism behaviors possess the full measure 
of cognitive capability.  What this acknowledgement reveals is that 
we now appreciate that our prior measurements for determining the base 
criteria for intelligence over-valued what we mistook for 
<I>intuition</I> - for instance, the ability to discern the meaning 
of a smile or a grimace or any of a countless number of context-dependent 
cues we once cavalierly assumed were natural and inevitable expressions 
of meaning.  This shift is important for the instruction of those with 
Asperger's, because it suggests that they can learn social cues they 
same way they learn multiplication tables or musical scales.  Indeed, 
many of these children not only find it easier to learn the likes of 
mathematics or musical notation, they sometimes retreat to these methodologies 
because they offer a <I>more</I> genuinely intuitive system of meaning 
than the base social cues we normally assume to be foundational.  And 
what this suggests in turn is that we distinguish between categories 
of sense-making that encompass self-replicating and self-limiting laws 
(such as mathematics) and those that do not (such as language as expressive 
of shared, social, community "nodes" of meaning).  The utility of this 
distinction for purposes of locating Goldsmith's work in the experimental 
"tradition" is that deliberate pursuit of derangement of the senses 
- both the literal senses and the conventions and norms to which they 
correspond - has been the foundation stone of experimental poetry since 
Rimbaud, at least.</P>
<P>The 
irony of this pursuit, and the discrepancy upon which Goldsmith has 
so precisely played, is that the very methods upon which the quest depend 
have served only to reinforce the conditions derangement is meant to 
unsettle.  If creativity is the focusing of language to the object of 
the poet's will, but that poet is necessarily immersed in the same meaning-lattice 
as the language itself, then exits to derangement cannot be achieved 
via any "creative" act.  What we need is not more creativity, but less; 
and since the consciousness from which creativity springs also contains 
the language to which the artist might apply that creativity, what we 
finally need is less <I>artist</I>.</P>
<P>This 
is hardly a sophisticated construct, but the peculiar genius of Kenneth 
Goldsmith is his dogged, insistent effort to eliminate from his methodology 
any fold or complication of the construct in which an indulgent artistry 
might hide.  When he speaks of <I>purging</I> his work, he transmits 
his understanding of the invidious means by which auctorial will asserts 
itself at the expense of true derangement. Goldsmith is becoming relentlessly 
literal-minded in the conception and execution of his writing, and what, 
finally, is Asperger's Disorder but a neurologically hard-wired literalism, 
an ability (as opposed to a curse) to apprehend data without the filters 
in which auctorial will become inevitably trapped?  Goldsmith has declared 
his devotion to "the practice of non-interventionalist writing: transcription, 
retyping, copying; moving information from one place to another as a 
valid writing practice," but the nature of information itself is utterly 
at question in this practice.  To deliberately occupy the literal, to 
dissolve the normally invisible boundaries upon which meaning rests, 
is to finally allow language itself to wreak its own derangements.&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P>Each 
of Goldsmith's projects for the last several years participates, with 
greater and lesser degrees of success, in this project of literalization; 
each of these projects echolocates intriguingly against psychological 
descriptors. Relevant to the DSM criteria listed above, consider the 
following affinities: "Marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal 
behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial _expression, body postures, 
and gestures to regulate social interaction":  this criteria evokes 
the latter sections of Goldsmith's 
<I>Fidget</I>, his record of the physical details of his thirteen hours 
of consciousness on the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of June, 1997.  The volume documents 
his efforts in eleven sections, clearly correspondent to the hour-by-hour 
chapters of Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>; Goldsmith's exhaustive methodology, 
set as it is on Bloomsday itself, reproduces much of Bloom's preoccupations.  
In the latter sections of <I>Fidget</I>, the burden of his task begins 
to erode Goldsmith's ability to maintain faithful reportage, so we decrement 
from text like</P>
<blockquote>
<P>Eyelids open. Tongue runs across upper 
lip moving from left side of mouth to right following arc of lip. Swallow. 
Jaws clench. Grind. Stretch. Swallow. Head lifts. Bent right arm brushes 
pillow into back of head. Arm straightens.&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
</blockquote>
<P>to</P>
<blockquote>
<P>At eight twenty-five eye damage custard. 
And silence is guide. Lips fall down, except on pavement. Body only 
river. Second body is gone to river. Over probablestone. A plash.&quot;&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>and</P>
<blockquote>
<P>&quot;Thandclapsle. Extend out in sled. 
Brokenicular clap in scent of body. In the chive leash forward. Stay 
stay, no. Rightut. Arched egg. Feet and egg platforms. I mean then a 
platformed body as does leave somewhat unsteadily." &nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P></blockquote>
<P>and finally</P>
<blockquote>
<P>".etarapes regniferof dna bmuht thgiR 
Hac thgir sehctarcs dnah thgiR ydob dniheb tsiF .."&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P></blockquote>
<P>which is from the final chapter, a duplicate 
of the first chapter, rendered backward.</P>
<P>Goldsmith 
explains this deterioration, or loss of reproductive fidelity (which 
most closely resembles the condition of "marked impairment"), as the 
result of drunkenness forced upon him by the originating pressures of 
the project itself.  But Goldsmith's own explanation of 
<I>Fidget</I> belies this explanation.  Attached to the text of 
<I>Fidget</I> itself is the following qualification:</P>
<P>I attached a microphone to my body 
and spoke every movement from 10:00 AM, when I woke up, to 11:00 PM, 
when I went to sleep. I was alone all day in my apartment and didn't 
answer the phone, go on errands, etc. I just observed my body and spoke. 
From the outset the piece was a total work of fiction. As I sit here 
writing this letter, my body is making thousands of movements; I am 
only able to observe one at a time. It's impossible to describe every 
move my body made on a given day. Among the rules for 
<I>Fidget</I> was that I would never use the first person &quot;I&quot; 
to describe movements. Thus every move was an observation of 
<I>a</I> body in space, not <I>my</I> body in a space. There was to 
be no editorializing, no psychology, no emotion-just a body detached 
from a mind.&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P>A 
body detached from a mind: a claim notable first for its impossibility, 
and also for the degree to which it enters the space of diagnostic possibility, 
since the apparent divorce between the intricacies of the autistic mind 
and the normative mind solicits the diagnostic endeavor to make clear 
the relationship between the <I>collective</I> mind and the 
<I>social</I> body.  Goldsmith's capitulations to both his body's demands 
and the demands of the project also prove directly proportional to what 
we more easily recognize as creative description - "poetry" - but the 
consequence of these passages, taken in the context of the work altogether, 
is not to glorify the latter entries with the gilding of poeticized 
language but to induce our suspicions regarding the assumed "plainness" 
of the earlier segments.  If that language is as artificial as the language 
of drunkenness, "creatively" decayed, then the entire book becomes suspect 
as a naked record of physical motion. And this only proves Goldsmith's 
paranoia that creativity is not something that requires pursuit and 
invention, but rather requires vigilance, since it will creep unannounced 
into any text that does not rigorously declare and defend its boundaries.&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P>The 
second and fourth of the <I>DSM</I>'s criteria for qualitative impairment 
also enjoy analogues to Goldsmithian projects.  "Failure to develop 
peer relationships to appropriate levels" and "lack of social and emotional 
reciprocity" are telling descriptors of Goldsmith's 
<I>Soliloquy</I>, which consists of every word Goldsmith spoke in one 
week.  Because <I>Soliloquy</I> faithfully records Goldsmith's utterances 
in multiple social contexts, but to the exclusion of the language of 
the other parties with whom Goldsmith conducts his social exchanges, 
the text defines lack of reciprocity, and thereby reveals the exhaustive 
vacuity of quotidian discourse. More importantly, this withdrawal of 
the dialogic element renders the standard markers of conversational 
discourse strange. Because the text is wholly unedited, this vacuity 
and estrangement also documents the fragility of so-called "peer" relationships.  
Consider this excerpt, pertaining to Goldsmith's meeting with Marjorie 
Perloff, who has, ironically enough, been one of Goldsmith's most lucid 
and elaborate defenders:</P>
<blockquote>
<P>"Um, well, I actually have a great 
meeting, um, I'm having lunch with, uh, one of the most powerful literary 
critics you know in the in academia in the country. It's her, Marjorie 
Perloff and, uh, I'm meeting her actually at the MOMA Members Dining 
Room for lunch today. And she's deeply powerful and I'm going to get 
her, I hope, to write a blurb for the back of my book and promote it."&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>As mortifying as this is, those fragments 
of necessarily one-sided conversations that do not expressly offer opportunities 
for social treachery are no less banal, and in bulk become transformingly 
alien:&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<blockquote>
<P>&quot;Yeah, if you were if you were 
taping you'd have 5 times as many tapes as me. I have very few tapes 
from this week. No, it's much better than it was. It's way better. Yeah. 
I don't mind, you know, it's just an industrial noise right now it's 
just it used to sort of scream and whine and, you know, no, it's a lot 
better.&quot;&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
</blockquote>
<P>Multiply by 
<I>X</I>, and the default ease of reading - second only to our unaccountably 
flippant facility with speech itself - approaches perfect opacity.  
Extrapolated from the plainest elements, the most complex effect.&nbsp;But 
again, as with <I>Fidget</I>, Goldsmith's justification of his self-imposed 
formal structures complicates the effect of the text itself even more 
markedly.  Of <I>Soliloquy</I>, he writes that &quot;If every word spoken 
daily in New York City were somehow to materialize as a snowflake, each 
day there would be a blizzard" - which indicates that Goldsmith is less 
interested in the immediate social and emotional effect of the language 
as it becomes fragmented than he is in the texture and volume of the 
fragments themselves, as they literally fill the vacuum constructed 
as neutral or otherwise valueless.  Or, as Gordon Tapper puts it, "Like 
the practitioners of concrete poetry, Goldsmith wants us to look at 
language so as to confront it as abstract visual images that represent 
utterance. He also wants us to see that language occupies space, and 
lots of it." </P>
<P>Off-handed 
descriptions of Goldsmith's work that draw upon psychological diagnoses 
similar to what we've done here are not uncommon - John Strausbaugh 
describes Goldsmith's <I>No. 111.2.7.93-10.20.96/6</I> as "a 606-page 
tour de force of ... <I>something</I>. Linguistic OCD maybe?"   Given 
that the text to which Strausbaugh refers is a book-length poem that 
itemizes Goldsmith's reading over the course of three years, from Feb. 
7, 1993, to Oct. 20, 1996, this description, while glib, is hardly inexact.  
The precision of the recording frame satisfies most criteria for 
<I>compulsive</I>, in that it allows no apparent room for manipulation 
but does not account for or justify its own precision. But the 
<I>obsessive</I> elements appear in Goldsmith's arrangement of the texts, 
according to alphabetical order, all phrases rhyming with the letter 
R, sorting these entries by number of syllables, starting with entries 
of one syllable for Chapter 1, progressing through entries of two syllables, 
three syllables, and further, concluding with a complete transcript 
of D.H. Lawrence's "The Rocking-Horse Winner", the 7,228 syllables of 
which end on the word &quot;winner.&quot;</P>
<P>Goldsmith's 
<I>No. 111 </I>approximates the <I>DSM</I>'s criteria for restricted 
repetitive behaviors, especially the "restricted patterns of interest 
... abnormal in intensity or focus" and "apparently inflexible adherence 
to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals."  In his pursuit of 
the <I>schwa</I> phoneme, Goldsmith could not have elected a more seemingly-random 
quest, but it is this variousness that allows him to introduce a version 
of the "space occupation" that fulfills social dimensions even more 
fully than does <I>Soliloquy</I>. Goldsmith's interest in conventionally 
neglected texts has a sometimes-polar quality: there's the 
<I>New York Times</I> transcribed in 
<I>Day</I> on one end, and then there's the individual's every utterance 
of <I>Soliloquy</I> on the other.&nbsp; We can think of these cultural poles 
as <I>hard ephemera</I> and <I>soft ephemera</I>, respectively, and 
Goldsmith routinely applies digital technology to reconstitute the ephemeral 
properties of each -- via the transfer of data to a digital &quot;larval 
stage&quot; from which he manages the text to its new form.&nbsp; But as an 
advocate for the potential of the reconstitutive medium itself, Goldsmith 
insists (quite logically) that digital media can be at least as hospitable 
to poetics as print, whose material properties allow Goldsmith perpetual 
opportunities for manipulations that draw attention to the whole disorienting 
range of words as space-complicating objects. But Goldsmith seems progressively 
disinterested in exploiting those digital media he has done so much 
to otherwise celebrate.&nbsp; Correspondent to this, 
<I>No. 111.2.7.93-10.20.96/</I>6, Goldsmith's most successful fusion 
of hard and soft ephemera to date, is ironically also the text whose 
methodology most powerfully resists the facility of digital manipulation.  
Goldsmith counted and allocated his syllable-ziggurats by hand and eye, 
and the reward for this labor is the unpredictable fecundity of the 
following:&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>

</blockquote>
<P>It is difficult to imagine a more catholic 
collection, equally evidential of the complex and unpredictable interweaving 
of ephemera from which language is constructed.  While this persuasively 
documents that unalloyed language contains greater potential for creative 
affect than more traditionally tooled "creative" writing, the drawback 
to <I>No. 111.2.7.93-10.20.96/6</I>, as Goldsmith himself admits, is 
that the text, for all its superficial randomness, is nevertheless heavily 
edited.</P>
<P>In 
a move away from this reliance on editorial intervention that simultaneously 
inverts the DSM's criteria for "persistent preoccupation with parts 
of objects", we must consider Goldsmith's 
<I>Day, </I>a full transcription of the complete contents of the Friday, 
September 1, 2000 edition of the <I>New York Times </I>

<P>In the following description of 
<I>Day</I>, Brad Ford communicates the difficulty of registering the 
full measure of <I>Day</I>'s cumulative effect: </P>
<blockquote>
<P>"Yet the reader has to look deeper than 
the articles. More is happening than words coming together to tell a 
story. I suppose if I were of a certain ilk and had read straight through, 
the first jump would have warned me. But also, the ads are obvious admonitions. 
<I>Day</I>'s format takes most typography and visual clues away from 
the reader. The ads are clearly not ads-they are copy and have no pictures, 
which is a different experience. The eye-catching tricks of Madison 
Avenue are stripped of all but caps and exclamations, and it deflates 
them or makes them comedy. Maps become columns of place names and a 
line for scale (0 miles 300). This is not quite the 
<I>New York Times</I>."  </P>
</blockquote>
<P>But 
in fact, <I>Day</I> is <I>precisely</I> the 
<I>New York Times</I>.  The deletion of "visual clues" forces the reader 
to apprehend the girth and perversity of the 
<I>Times</I> as assemblage, as a monolith that - via the refusal of 
the literal that context-dependency secures - manages to hide its miraculous 
properties in the shallow labyrinth of its everyday use. Goldsmith describes 
his goal as "to be as uncreative in the process as possible. It's one 
of the hardest constraints an artist can muster, particularly on a project 
of this scale; with every keystroke comes the temptation to &quot;fudge,&quot; 
&quot;cut-and-paste,&quot; and &quot;skew&quot; the mundane language. 
But to do so would be to foil the exercise." True enough, if we appreciate 
that at this point in his evolution, Goldsmith has collapsed into the 
category of "skew" all that creativity that orients as it wriggles to 
unnerve. With <I>Day</I>, Goldsmith's success in containing the editorial/creative 
urge frees the text proportionately: read straight through - a feat 
so taxing relative to context-reliant reading that few of the text's 
commentators admit to being able to do it at all - 
<I>Day</I> astonishes.&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><b>2.</b></P>
<P>It's 
easy to mock Goldsmith's books before you've read them; even at the 
level of the hook, they readily appall, as Goldsmith will admit.  Of 
his transcription for <I>Day</I>, he confesses, "never have I faced 
a writing process this dry, this extreme, this boring." He then proceeds 
to quote John Cage: &quot;If something is boring after two minutes, 
try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. 
Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.&quot; Corollary 
to this boredom-as-defense-against-disorientation, there are peppered 
liberally throughout reviews of Kenneth Goldsmith's writing notices 
of how <I>funny</I> it can often be; how the juxtapositions that accumulate 
through the processes of his literalized projects become both odd and 
ha-ha.  But juxtaposition as a means to achieve disorientation reaches 
a point of diminishing returns very quickly: note the original effect 
of Duchamp's <I>Fountain</I>, and the speed with which it has become 
a kind of visual shorthand for the cheap obviousness of modern and postmodern 
"tricks".  The disorientation <I>Fountain</I> once achieved depends 
upon an enjambment of contexts.  What is this, but the language of metaphor 
writ large, and what is metaphor but the exhausted handmaiden of creativity 
itself, the self-defeating impulse Goldsmith strives to quash?  Metaphor 
functions by unmediated conflation of objects derived from uncommonly 
situated contexts. But the limited utility of metaphor regarding the 
inducement of disorientation rests in metaphor's reification of the 
contexts it otherwise seeks to manipulate. Here is X and here is Y - 
while we may not be familiar with the juxtaposition of the two, and 
while that juxtaposition may open the door to an observation or apprehension 
of both objects that deviates from the observations more commonly associated 
with their original contexts, it cannot but re-assert the legitimacy 
of the contexts it manipulates.  This is because the effect of disorientation 
- its blast radius, as it were - is delimited by the perceiver's ability 
to determine what does or does not belong.  And that ability, rather 
than being undermined by that apparent and initially radicalizing effect 
of juxtaposition, is rather <I>reinforced</I> by it.  This is why the 
appropriate appreciation of Goldsmith's achievement lies not in its 
incidental and accidental metaphors, but in the much more discomfiting 
effects of its cumulative estrangements.</P>
<P>Those 
who encountered <I>Fountain</I> for the first time, enjoyed (or at least 
felt) the jolt provided by the superimposition of the hidden quotidian 
- the sub-social space reserved for bodily functions - on the tableau 
of high art, of refined cerebration.  But that jolt was bought at the 
expense of cementing the disjunction between the two contexts.  In order 
for Duchamp's effort to disarm his audience's suppositions to work at 
all, it had to confirm that audience's belief in their collective ability 
to discern high and low, public and private.  Disorientation by juxtaposition 
pulls the rug out from under the victim of art only to remind them of 
the solidity of the ground on which the rug rests.  The victim stumbles, 
but does not really fall.</P>
<P>By 
now, of course, juxtaposition's tricks are more than exhausted - they've 
become a trope, more obvious in their effect than the supposedly obvious 
assumptions they are meant to illustrate.  If the visual arts are, as 
* says, always fifty years ahead of their literary counterparts, then 
poetry has more than compensated for the gap by way of its long dependence 
on metaphor as both technique and, in large measure, defining property.</P>
<P>This 
does not, however, mean that the original function of metaphor and juxtaposition 
- to restore the strangeness of the specific - has or can be abandoned.  
What it does mean is that more extreme strategies are required for the 
achievement of the condition juxtaposition once aspired to induce; Kenneth 
Goldsmith and his "extreme writing" successfully secure the strangeness 
his forebears sought but failed to fully to reach.  In place of juxtaposition, 
Goldsmith practices a form of <I>textual amplification</I>.  By virtue 
of pathological loyalty to the textual consequences of his originating 
designs, Goldsmith's work regularly injects text not into a field by 
which it can be compared to other texts, but into a vacuum, in which 
the dimensions and properties of the text simultaneously swell and shrink. 
<I>Day</I>, for instance, may initially be read against the more common 
newsprint format from which it is derived, but the 
<I>whole</I> of Day soundly defeats any such comparison. Similarly, 
<I>Fidget</I> tempts the reader to interpolate from the text the circumstances 
that prompt Goldsmith's speech, but again, the cumulative effect of 
the text proves too distinct to indulge such shortcuts and temptations 
to "successfully" re-contextualize the language.&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P>In 
its transparent dependence upon concept, Goldsmith's work resembles 
the project- and process-based conception of Oulipo, but differs in 
one obvious yet radical fashion: Goldsmith executes what Oulipo merely 
posits.  &nbsp;</P>
<P>This 
execution represents more than mere perseverance on Goldsmith's part, 
and establishes the necessary importance of literal-mindedness as practice. 
Oulipian experiments deny practice not as matter of intransigence, but 
as a matter of principle: theoretically speaking, once articulated, 
the idea of a writing project has achieved everything that the project 
itself ever could.  From the Oulipian perspective, to 
<I>apply</I> an Oulipian conceit defeats the very purpose of contriving 
the conceit itself.  The artist who pursues the conceit's execution 
therefore adopts either a deep misunderstanding of the conceit itself 
or a willful naiveté. Goldsmith clearly falls into this latter category, 
and his deliberate "naiveté" has proven consistently resourceful, and 
puts the lie to the Oulipian dis-emphasis on actual product.  Indeed, 
his efforts in this area are reminiscent of John Cage's famous response 
to the criticism that anyone could do what he did: "Of course they could," 
he replied, "but they don't."  Goldsmith shares with Cage a conviction 
that for all the elegance of the conception, the pluralities engendered 
by the concept's application are worthwhile in their own right, indeed 
of redemptive of the concept's promise.</P>
<P>Several 
of Goldsmith's more recent works demonstrate the dual means by which 
the product redeems the act of production.  With projects such as 
<I>1.11</I> or <I>Fidget</I> or <I>Soliloquy</I>, Goldsmith describes 
and executes methodologies that, as he himself notes, result in texts 
that in no fundamental way resemble alternative executions of the inspiring 
methodology.  This bespeaks one kind of product-based utility, which 
is the virtue of specificity as unpredictable by methodology.  Any effort 
to reproduce the particular effect of works like 
<I>Fidget</I> or <I>Soliloquy</I> would fail, regardless of fidelity 
to the general rule from which each is derived.  It is important to 
note, however, that this "failure" is limited only to the Oulipian standard 
of concept-over-product, and thereby suggests the flaw in the Oulipian 
imagination.  Indeed, works like <I>Fidget</I> demonstrate that the 
specificity of the product can elicit far greater degrees of provocation 
than their conceptual inspirations. Of course, the extreme nature of 
these projects (record and transcribe your every word for a week; transcribe 
your every gesture for a day) also dovetails neatly with the amplification 
effect introduced above.  The very excess of the conceptions results 
in text that, injected into a context-vacuum, approaches a quality that 
disorients simply by scale, or confusion thereof. This is the disorientation 
that redeems the promise of juxtaposition, but without the circuitous 
dependencies that hobble metaphor.</P>
<P>While 
his inheritance of Cage's concerns is obvious, and his adoptions of 
some Oulipo precepts equally clear, Goldsmith is geometrically more 
than poetry's analogue to Cage or Oulipo's idiot-savant son.  In fact, 
Goldsmith is on record as having a "peevish" response to the gap between 
the promises of Cage's rhetoric and Cage's willingness to adhere in 
practice to the demands he made at the level of theory: by claiming 
Cage "whose mission it was to accept all sound as music, failed; his 
filter was on too high. He permitted only the sounds that fell into 
his worldview. Commercial sounds, pop music, lowbrow culture, sounds 
of violence and aggression, etc. held no place in the Cagean pantheon," 
Goldsmith tacitly presents himself as the cure to the affliction even 
Cage was unwilling to completely cure. Goldsmith particular criticism of Cage's unwillingness 
to follow to the full extent of its logical consequence the claim that 
all sound, including its absence, should be thought of as constitutive 
of music, manifests in Goldsmith's own marriages of hard and soft ephemera. 
Fully applied loyalty to Cagean standards leaves little room for the 
kind of performative specificity for which Cage was well-known, and 
Goldsmith strikes directly at this disjunction and identifies the privileged 
position of compositional or auctorial control - of Œcreation' - as 
that which interferes with a full realization of Cage's claim.  It is 
this interference that the arc of Goldsmith's art seeks to eliminate, 
and within that arc Goldsmith himself is not immune to the suasions 
of interventionalist writing.  In <I>Fidget</I>, for instance, he proves 
incapable of adhering to the rigors of his prescribed task; as mentioned 
previously, the drunkenness to which it drives him provides only the 
most explicit opportunities in the text for more traditionally auctorial 
modifications. <I>Soliloquy</I>, likewise, creates a perpetual opportunity 
for interventionist manipulations, for though while Goldsmith remains 
committed to the transcription of his every spoken word, the occasion 
of the project proves as fluid a provocation as any of the other social 
contexts for which Goldsmith appears willing to tweak his language.</P>
<P>The 
position at which we finally arrive is one at which Goldsmith seems 
forced to choose between methodological demons.  On this axis, there 
is the threat of principled inconsistency, a la Cage, and at the other, 
a dis-emphasis of product, a la Oulipo.  Works such as 
<I>Fidget</I> and <I>Soliloquy</I> ably demonstrate the flaws of Oulipian 
hyper-conceptuality by tendering infinitely diverse degrees of specificity, 
but also invite the kind of manipulation of material that Goldsmith 
finds so irritating in Cage. What to do?</P>
<P>Goldsmith 
resolves this dilemma by placing his greater faith in Cage's principles 
than did Cage himself.  The result is the full advent of his "uncreativity", 
and the ascension of his amplification strategy.  Unlike his previous 
works, the newer projects of <I>Day</I> and 
<I>Year</I> <I>do</I> produce texts that would maintain uniform properties 
regardless of the multiplicity of their executions.  So this virtue 
of product-and-process is lost, but the effects of amplification undiluted 
by auctorial temptations more than regain what is thereby compromised.  
These products more closely resemble those of Warhol (especially the 
Warhol of <I>Empire</I>, his eight-hour film of a static shot of the 
Empire State Building) than they do of Cage, and Year in particular 
promises to synthesize the sometimes-contradictory impulses of Goldsmith's 
work.</P><br><br>

<blockquote>
<P>A couple of breaks of sunshine over the 
next couple of hours, what little sunshine there is left. Remember, 
this is the shortest day of the year. Looks like the clear skies hold 
off till later on tonight. It will be brisk and cold, low temperatures 
will range from twenty-nine in some suburbs to thirty-eight in midtown. 
Not a bad shopping day tomorrow, sunshine to start, then increasing 
clouds, still breezy, with a high near fifty. Couple of showers around 
tomorrow night, er, tomorrow evening, into early tomorrow night, otherwise 
partly cloudy later on, low thirty. For Monday, windy and colder with 
sunshine, a few clouds, high forty-two. And then for, er, Christmas 
Eve, mostly sunny, but with a chilly wind, high near forty degrees. 
For Christmas itself, cloudy with a chance for rain or snow, high thirty-six. 
Forty-three degrees right now and cloudy, relative humidity is fifty-five 
percent in midtown. Repeating the current temperature forty-three going 
down to thirty-eight in midtown. &nbsp;<BR>

<P>Goldsmith himself: "I'm intrigued with 
the simplest and often overlooked aspect of situations. With the web, 
people tend to be dazzled (blinded) by the more complicated aspects 
of the web -- from data-driven artworks to Flash -- whilst tending to 
minimize the social, political, and artistic implications of that upon 
which the whole system is built."&nbsp;<BR></P>
<P>To 
return to situations, simple, overlooked: the Situationists, who derived 
their name from this superficially modest yet hyperbolically ambitious 
goal, believed that art as understood to that point interfered with, 
rather than facilitated, this dream.  The text from 
<I>Year </I>is nothing as exalted as the weather itself; approximations 
of that perpetually ineffable phenomenon are among the oldest of poetic, 
"creative" enterprises. Year is less and more. It is our accumulated 
narrative, our speech <I>about</I> and not 
<I>of, </I>and as such places the failure of description, the impossibility 
of ever containing that in which you are immersed, at the focus of our 
attention.  In its scale and humble specificity, its admixture of alertness 
and unconsciousness, the text promises the most elemental properties 
of the world will be sufficient to the demands the poetic impulse makes 
upon that world.  And in his enormous and detailed erasures, Kenneth 
Goldsmith whisks away clouds in favor of their sky, which he proves 
to be anything but empty.</P>
