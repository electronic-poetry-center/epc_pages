<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our  man Kenneth Goldsmith, music reviewer and <A HREF="http://www.wfmu.org/%7Ekennyg" TARGET="new">WFMU DJ</A>, has kept busy cranking out 
  two books and a pamphlet since I last looked. They all continue his obsessive&#146;s 
  experimentation with concrete language, list-making and an intensity of close 
  observation that makes the everyday glow with transcendence.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">In <I>Fidget</I> 
  (<A HREF="http://www.chbooks.com/online/fidget/index.html" TARGET="new">Coach House</A>, 107 pages, $16.95) he sets out to record his every twitch, scratch, 
  step, burp and gulp from waking up to falling back asleep 13 hours later on 
  June 16, 1997. He clipped on a microphone and literally taped himself reciting 
  every move, all day. A typically mad Goldsmith experiment. At first he&#146;s 
  recording observations as precise and minute, as Marjorie Perloff says in an 
  afterword, as an Edward Muybridge strip: </font></P>
<blockquote>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Eyelids 
  open. Tongue runs across upper lip moving from left side of mouth to right following 
  arc of lip. Swallow. Jaws clench. Grind. Stretch. Swallow. Head lifts. Bent 
  right arm brushes pillow into back of head. Arm straightens.&quot;</font></P>
  </blockquote>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After a 
  few hours of this he begins to drive himself nuts. His reports first get clipped 
  (&quot;Scratch. Stretch. Rub. Click. Peck. Hit. Shift. Roll&quot;). Then he 
  panics and gets drunk, and his recitation turns into crazy poetry: &quot;At 
  eight twenty-five eye damage custard. And silence is guide. Lips fall down, 
  except on pavement. Body only river. Second body is gone to river. Over probablestone. 
  A plash.&quot; By the final hour he&#146;s babbling. (<I>Fidget</I> is at Printed 
  Matter and available through Small Press Distribution at <A HREF="http://www.spdbooks.org/interact/item.asp?cat=&amp;subcat=&amp;itemno=L767&amp;pos=1&amp;dept=" TARGET="new">spdbooks.org</A>.)</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><I>6799</i> 
  is Goldsmith indulging in his list-making OCD. He was asked by <I><A HREF="http://www.zingmagazine.com" TARGET="new">zingmagazine</A></I>, 
  the art journal, to list some of the records in his vast collection. Characteristically, 
  once he got started he couldn&#146;t stop, and delivered a 92-page book&#146;s 
  worth of a list&#150;every record he acquired 1967-1999, in alphabetical order 
  by artist, from A Kombi&#146;s <I>Music to Drive By</I> through pages of Various 
  Artists to Peter Zummo&#146;s <I>Zummo With an X</I>. There was nothing for 
  <I>zing</I> to do but print it as a book and distribute it shrinkwrapped with 
  the current Winter 2000 issue (which you can find at Hudson newsstands). Obviously 
  you&#146;d have to be as nuts as he is to read the thing; I think of it more 
  in the Jewish mystical traditional of text as a marvelous or totemic object.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Gertrude 
  Stein on Punctuation</i> is the most playful of the three. In the first section 
  he reproduces Stein&#146;s wonderful discourse on punctuation from <I>Lectures 
  in America</I> (&quot;...Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one 
  use it the question mark. Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing 
  and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, 
  just an unnecessary name of something...&quot;). In the second section, &quot;Gertrude 
  Stein&#146;s Punctuation From Gertrude Stein on Punctuation,&quot; he strips 
  out all the punctuation in her essay&#150;every comma, period, apostrophe, hyphen&#150;all 
  of which, being Gertrude Stein, she uses sparingly anyway. He scatters these 
  squirts and dots and dashes randomly across three pages, as though, he says 
  to me, he&#146;d gathered them in his palm and then blown them across the pages 
  like dust. </font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">A nice little 
  homage to Gertrude, it is packaged in <I>5 &amp; 10¢</I>, a limited-edition, 
  $200 box set of 25 artists&#146; pamphlets produced by New Jersey&#146;s Abaton 
  Books, home of Laurie Bortz&#146;s strange plays and the wobbly genius of high 
  school singer-songwriter <A HREF="http://www.wfmu.org/%7Ekennyg/popular/articles/nowottny.html" TARGET="new">Marianne Nowottny</A>.
