<td><font size=4>Now available from primitive publications -- "Lead, Glass and Poppy,"
by <a href="index.html">Kristin Prevallet</a>, a riveting work incorporating past and present news
stories into a "millennial convergence poem."
<p>

About this chapbook, Mark Wallace writes: "Kristin Prevallet's work
presents a distinctly modern witchery, a series of spells and
counterspells designed to drive us from complacency with a
paradoxically generous black magic.  In her new chapbook, 'Lead, Glass
and Poppy,' Kristin details exactly what happens when human beings
take off blithely for the sun; they experience intense heat,
destructive
fallout, and the debris of deluded dreams.  What surprise, then, that
they
find themselves once more in the chaotic history of misunderstood
desires for transcendence."
