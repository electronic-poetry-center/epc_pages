  <p><b>Some Notes on Hank Lazer&#8217;s Note</b></p>
  <p><i>Days</i>, Lavender Ink, 2002.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In <i>Days</i>, Hank Lazer&#8217;s latest collection 
    of poetry, one encounters a successful labor of love, a day journal in bass 
    syncopation and off-rhyme&#8212;such musicality!&nbsp; Then, sparingly employed 
    in a &#8220;laboratory space for experimentation with the resources and possibilities 
    of the short line and for new modes of lyricism&#8221;, graceful Mobius strips 
    of words glide across pages, endlessly strung together and moved along through 
    a calendar of sound, breath, and silence.&nbsp; The influence of &#8220;source-elements&#8221; 
    in this text: Monk and Stein, Zukofsky and Oppen, Creeley, Coltrane, Miles, 
    and Dickinson among other countless cited or unannounced amalgam, roam this 
    space, having been sifted through the poet&#8217;s imagination and memory, 
    now accompanying his original mind.&nbsp; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The core as in <i>corazon</i> of this enjoyable 
    book is not without sentiment, yet it circumvents the sentimental by transfusing 
    emotion with experiment, and vice versa.&nbsp; In this series of poems Lazer 
    has found himself without regret, &#8220;&#8230;a way away from some of the 
    implicit do&#8217;s and don&#8217;t&#8217;s of avant garde praxis&#8221; hoping 
    &#8220;&#8230;the tutelage of Thelonius Monk&#8230;kept the writing &#8220;wrong&#8221; 
    enough&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;and the writing <i>is</i> wonderfully wrong enough.&nbsp; 
    Moving the reader through alternating melodic and disjunctive &#8216;notes&#8217; 
    without &#8216;responsible&#8217; stylistic weight, the reader follows willingly, 
    even slightly suspended as one might experience &#8220;A Love Supreme&#8221;, 
    to another day and the next variation.</p>

  <p style='line-height:150%'>next to you</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Throughout <i>Days</i> Lazer candidly plays with 
    his capacity for observation and affection: of and for language, rhythm, and 
    specificity: the word, its syllables:&nbsp; 138&nbsp; &#8220;fabric echoes 
    fabri // cation you&#8217;re making // that up &amp;&#8230;//.&#8221;&nbsp; 
    Equally, amusement and gratitude embrace unpredictable turns through the ambitious/ 
    ambiguous quotidian &#8216;day&#8217;: the familiarity of loved ones and objects, 
    a concurrence of nature and ideas, passion for vernacular and humor.&nbsp; 
    138 (cont.) &#8220;country boy eddie// says&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never 
    et// y mology I didn&#8217;t// like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the local// not

    &#8220;I sing the body// eclectic uh defective// icing the bawdy//&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; 
    These miniature, midstream reflections entered in a humble diary, not &#8220;breathy 
    epiphanies&#8221;&#8212;too knowledgeable and modest for that, <i>Days </i>is 
    not actively seeking answers; yet in its constant inquiry preemptively rejoices 
    in, receives, then offers its generous rewards.&nbsp; As many of these rewards 
    seem to come about through chance, this willingness to explore in <i>Days</i> 
    calls to mind Norman Fischer&#8217;s &#8220;doubt and accident&#8230;at the 
    heart of what art has always been&#8221;, as well as parallels to Fischer&#8217;s 
    <i>Success </i>: the journal as ontological query, art as the &#8220;undoing 
    of everything&#8221;, the layers of &#8216;chance&#8217; in Lazer&#8217;s 
    words, and their oxymoronically accurate placement. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>137</p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'>everyday is doubt</p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'>here pictured</p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'>as you will</p>

  <p style='line-height:150%'>men &amp; comb</p>
  <p>the gully &amp; the ridge</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The book itself is a lovely entity.&nbsp; The 
    232 poems are encased within a cover of black and a-dash-of-red-strokes (tadpoles?) 
    on a glossy white background (untitled painting by poet and painter Che Qianz, 
    ink on paper, 1993).&nbsp; They are then embedded between scarlet front and 
    back inside pages which open to the white and black of the printed page; visually 
    and tactilely pleasing, announcing the experience of the senses to come.&nbsp; 
    The design of the poems of mostly neat short ten line blocks emphasizes a 
    Haiku-like brevity of the &#8216;extended&#8217; moment&#8212;the day, while 
    select words resonate in a palimpsest of possible readings.&nbsp; This is 
    all enhanced/negated through mischievously adroit puns and alliteration, penciled 
    in numbers and marginalia, corrections and enjambment.&nbsp; With great skill, 
    Lazer moves the reader without manipulation, while challenging and amusing 
    her/him sufficiently toward the next day&#8217;s installment in this deeply 
    felt and intelligent foray into the ordinary.&nbsp; The poems in <i>Days</i> 
    are not definitive; they easily accommodate improvisation and ir/reverence, 
    never belying an Eastern capacity for clarity and inconclusive wonder.&nbsp;
