David Ignatow on <B>Doublespace:</B><P>

<blockquote><B>Doublespace</B> is a noble attempt to bridge the chasm
between language poetry and the traditional anecdotal and meditative
poetry of the "free form mode".  Lazer stands between the two
antagonists like a Hercules carrying both on his shoulders adjacent to
one another, seeking through contact with both the possibility of
creating a language that both may be able to draw upon, each for its
own purpose. Or is he trying to say that each has its place in the
armory of the modern, each with its own means of communication. There
is no question that each mode has its work to do: free form to keep
the surface of life familiar yet resonant and Language poetry to
uncover through indirection via rejection of the familiar surface to
win a whole new perspective on life and its surface, which then will
cause new thinking and doing closer to contemporary fragmented and
outworn culture. Hank Lazer has taken upon himself in his book
<B>Doublespace </B>to bring the division boldly into the open, with
the two modes printed side by side under one cover. If we are to
continue to debate the issue, this then that Lazer has done is what is
needed. It comes at a moment of historic change in the cultures and
social arrangements throughout the world.</blockquote><P>

Susan Howe on <B>Doublespace:</B><P>

<blockquote><B>Doublespace</B> is about discontinuity, duration, and
the dynamics of interruption. In fact no frame can cover the eternal
conflict of freedom and necessity. No frame is possible. Words return
to rooms of fables. <B>Doublespace</B> interrogates an author's final
intentions for material production. Lazer's writing returns to
unsettle American cultural inheritance; our departures, abandonments,
brushes with still life, holes in history. The founding act is a dream
of beginning with a proper name. Blanks break up. Everyone counts
assault. Later case histories at the locked gate are converted to
fact. In the hang of telling time what won't follow.  <B>Doublespace
</B>is an important and eccentric book.</blockquote><P>

George Starbuck on <B>Doublespace:</B>

<blockquote>I was handed this as a finest, newest specimen of
"Language" Poetry, which it is, which it is. And I had been wondering
if "Languag" "Poetry" would be getting over its Molierian amazement at
itself. And so I trudged, clambered, sauntered, stooped, for a long
ways, tracking H Lazer's ingenuities and discoveries, a long way into
it all before I woke up to where (and how) I had been taken.<BR> What
a lovely, capacious, populous poem of America surrounded me. Hailed
me, corralled me, jargonned at me. Jazzy and matter of factly
apocalyptic. I stood rebuked I stood entranced.<BR> There is a city
block in America which took down its children's slides.  There are the
small town treasure troves of lawbooks, repositories of a craziness
second to none. Goldmine for a connoisseur of palavers. He counts
among these lawyers some of his own go getter ancestors. The Law is
his test case of the toomuchness all around.<BR> He sees the glitter,
he hears the guff. No need to hoke up an answering guff, on behalf of
the beautiful, the good. It is, as is, rich, wonderful and
sufficient.<BR> The answer to the test is that he is not in it to
score against bushwa and blague. He is showing us the ineluctable
welter from which Justice is made and justice done.<BR> His ear is
quick and dab accurate, his dance sense superb. He can talk rings
around rap, croon you gently and simply and melt your heart. His eye
for stuff is right on. Even his eye for typos and misspellings:
preternaturally au courant. He wings it without sardonic winks and
sighs.<BR> "I hope you follow that. " SO he says, ending a
poem. Germane five ways and a joke on itself. And also, if you like,
it addresses the Poets and the Future, and my guess is Yes: we
follow. From now on, one of the small number of poets we follow is
you.</blockquote><P>

David Antin on <B>Doublespace:</B><P>
 <CENTER> there was a device that
used to be employed in psychological<BR>laboratories to demonstrate
certain properties of color vision that<BR> consisted of a binocular
viewing glass which exhibited the same<BR> objective to one eye as red
and to the other as green with the result that <BR>the single image
seen by the viewer oscillated continuously<BR> between green and red
<B>Doublespace</B> operates something like this<BR> in that it appears
to present two ways of thinking and working<BR> that contend for the
same (doubled) space a modernist way the way<BR> of collage that
fragments and assembles language registers and<BR> styles in a
junkyard of mediated texts and an older narrative<BR> way that tracks
its meaning through life experience under the<BR> fitful lights of
memory and desire moving from right to left<BR> like hebrew or left to
right like english the two ways refuse to<BR> blend each exhibiting
its own excellences and insufficiencies<BR> as a kind of either/or
whose continuous oscillations generate<BR> perhaps by way of desire
the faint after image of another space</CENTER><P>

<B>Doublespace</B> asks how to vouch for divergent writing practices:
how to honor each without disavowing the other. Put as a problem of
current literary history, <B>Doublespace</B> resists the inscription
of American culture's segregation of writing
communities. <B>Doublespace</B> includes poems published over a period
of sixteen years in a wide ranae of maqazines, from
<SAMP>Temblor</SAMP> and <SAMP>Central Park </SAMP>to the <SAMP>
Virqinia Quarterly Review</SAMP> and <SAMP>Southern Review.</SAMP>
<B>Doublespace</B> presents a text unique in American poetry.<P>

A native of San Jose, California, Hank Lazer has taught for fourteen years in the English Department at the University of Alabama where he is Assistant Dean for Humanities and Fine Arts.
