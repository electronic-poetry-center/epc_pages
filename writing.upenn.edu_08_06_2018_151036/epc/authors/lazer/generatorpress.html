Charles Bernstein on<FONT SIZE=4> <KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS:</KBD><P><FONT SIZE=3> 

<blockquote> "To be is to be interrupted" (interpreted) might be the
motto of Hank Lazer's novel series of poetic investigations titled
<KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS</KBD>. Everyday life is hysterical, or
hysterically ruptured with excruciating, often hilarious, detail or
detritus or do you know another way to bring home (and the poem is the
best home any boy's ever had) what parallel or paralyzed or
conflicting or restricting discourses might say to each other if they
met on a crowded page or in the gaze of a deserted reader. All's here,
any body there?<P></blockquote>

Gregory Jay on <FONT SIZE=4><KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS:</KBD><P><FONT SIZE=3>

<blockquote>We interrupt our regularly scheduled poetry programming to
bring you the following noose item: Hank Lazer's
<KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS</KBD> is a damned pun to read, as long as you
donut mine having yore convictions overtroped. For revolutionaries
here's some mao bull in the china shop, moore public frauds, plus a
stein full of double entry accounts tolling reverses in the economy of
our polit(e)ical language. Three fears for Henry who, like his
namesake, thoreauly surveys our "pro state cancer", puts "muddy in the
bank", gets repeated citations for a "pair of taxes, identifies with
loony boston birds, designs our metropolitan homes, & takes the
bottomless measure of our wanting. Tanks for knotting, reggae
rebbe.</blockquote><P>


<KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS</KBD> presents a series of ten collage poems
incorporating a wide range of layouts and materials, from batting
averages to critical theory, from fashion and interior design columns
to Emerson's Journals, from solicitations by a literary agent to
research in neurophysiology. <KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS</KBD>places
poetry's more traditional lyrical and narrative voices within a
bombarded and over determined linguistic field. At once humorous and
metaphysically in earnest, Lazer's <KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS</KBD>
explores a poetry fusing poesis and politics.<P>

A native of San Jose, Califomia, Lazer has taught for fourteen years
in the English Department at the University of Alabama, where he is
Assistant Dean for Humanities and Fine Arts. Lazer is also a noted
critic of contemporary poetry. In addition to
<KBD>INTER(IR)RUPTIONS</KBD>, 1992 will see the publication of <B><a
href="doublespace.html">Doublespace</a>.</B> a major collection of
Lazer's poetry from the 1970's and 80's, by Segue Books.
