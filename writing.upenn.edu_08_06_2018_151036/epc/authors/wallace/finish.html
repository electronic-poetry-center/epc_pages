	How To Finish A Story, or My Correspondence School

Indefinite clamor defines direction

Once upon a time, in the darkest recesses
of the mind, a factory began
to feel bad about itself.
This factory, despite being well-respected
and having plenty of friends, thought
that something was missing.
People worked in it all day,
it spewed out all the smoke it wanted
and its products were suitably faulty
yet what, really, was the meaning
of it all? Politics and literature
left the factory cold.
If I could be a space station,
the factory thought, maybe
I could realize my potential.
As soon as possible, the factory
began restructuring. It laid off workers,
got rid of old equipment,
brought in the latest technology
and a highly expert staff.
This took time, but a year later
the factory was ready to lift off.
The only question was where to go.
The moon had been done. Mars was War
and Venus love, mere human wastes of time.
But Saturn had those beautiful rings
and soon the factory was there
sipping Pina Coladas, and doing
geological surveys. It's true, the factory thought,
even a factory needs new horizons.
With that in mind, the factory began to write its memoirs.

Dear Sir:
	Can you please tell me how to start my own literary magazine? Out here in the swamps it's easy to feel isolated, and being an editor just may stop me from becoming alcoholic.

Dear Sir:
	Is it true that night is blackest just before the dawn?

Dear Sir:
	Why is it that most animals with wings are called birds, but some are called bats? My boyfriend says my interest in this is twisted and sick. He thinks I should go to hairdressing school. But at night I lie awake wondering.

Dear Sir:
	A figure with three sides is a triangle, but figures with four sides can be called squares or rectangles, depending on the lengths of the various sides.

Dear Sir:
	I wonder a lot if there's a conspiracy. My wife says no, that people are motivated more by confusion, greed, blindness, and a deep-seated and ineradicable instinctive animal fear. But she can be naive, and doesn't know Chuck as well as I do.

Dear Sir:
	What makes you think I'm going to let you get away with it?

Dear Sir:
	I have a constant urge to do things that will embarrass me, sometimes even that will physically harm me. Is there money in this?

	THIS

	IS

	AS

	SIMPLE

	AS

	IT

	SEEMS

	BUT

	NOT

	AS

	IT

	GETS

Dear Sir:
I don't know what to do
about many things.
It's hot out,
the sun is shining,
I love my friends.
I've read a lot
of theories about society.
Where do you start

At home?
Through education?
Through legislation?
Do you want
to change people's minds?
I think I do
but I'm not always sure
what I think.
Do you know
who's to blame?
Is anyone?
Is it structures
or consciousness?
Is it ignorance
or malice or both?
Is it fear?
What needs to be done?
Am I happy
or unhappy?
I worry a lot,
I'll tell you that much.
What about you?

During High Modernism
belief in the absolute significance of art
and the need for devoting yourself to it
above and beyond all other concerns
was common, almost a cliche.

Most writers of supernatural tales
don't explicitly state that they believe
in the supernatural, which raises the question
of why they write supernatural tales.

One of the central confusions
in the contemporary avant garde
is the relation between politics and literature.

The above sentences, all of which
are statements, have an uncertain
truth value. You cannot trust them.
That does not mean, however,
that they are made in bad faith.
Which brings us to other problems.
How do you know if something is done in good faith?
In what circumstances does it matter or not?

Do you prefer to finish a book
or to start one? What's the difference
between a poem and a story?
What makes something a narrative
or not?

Do you think of yourself as part of your society
or outside it?
What is social and what metaphysical?
I'd like to think my poems explore.
But I'm never sure how much I think I know in advance.
