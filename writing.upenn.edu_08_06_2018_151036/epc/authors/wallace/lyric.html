<blockquote>

 1) No statement about the final value of a form or genre
of poetry can possibly be true (including this statement). It always
remains possible to test the value of a form or genre again, to see
what use might be made in the present moment of its historically
determinable characteristics, or to alter, recombine, or change those
characteristics to redefine possibilities in the present moment. One
interesting possibility, for instance, would be to combine elements
historically thought of as belonging to one sort of form with elements
of another form, thus distorting both forms to create new hybrids. In
any case, while the value of a form or genre can be determined partly
by looking at all the uses that have been made of it, that
determination can never be complete, not only because new readings of
old uses of that form or genre can always take place, but also because
the value of forms and genres can and will be changed by any new uses
made of it.  

<p> 2) I read Pound's dictum "make it new"
ironically. There is no doubt that innovation in poetic forms
continues to be of great value in a society that attempts to fix and
control modes not only of writing but of living. But it is also true
that the "new" itself is frought with contradictions, and is easily
co-opted by the forces of capitalism and imperialism, which are both
interested in extending themselves into the terrain of the "new" in
order to expand their resources and control. The "new" may or may not
challenge dominant social assumptions. I find the "new" useful to the
extent that it challenges assumptions, but only with the ironic
awareness that the challenge itself is far more likely to be
co-optable than challenging. Charles Borkhuis: "you originals/are the
biggest dupes." As Terry Eagleton has pointed out, as long as the
ownership of materials is in certain hands, the words of a writer,
however challenging, cannot do much to change power relations (372).

<p> 3) All writers have only the past to work with when they are
making something new. The new is made by borrowing from, changing,
refiguring, perhaps demolishing the past, out of a perception of what
might possibly exist. The new is possible only because there is a
past. 

 <p> 4) Currently dominant notions of past, present and future
are expressions of western linear time and its supposed driving force,
progress. While the present and future may develop out of the past, it
is not clear when it comes to literature and other arts (leaving aside
the vast question of social change) that new work necessarily
"improves" the work of the past. Does <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>
represent progress from <i>Tristram Shandy</i>; is Charles Olson's work a
"refinement" of Pound's, whatever influence he takes from Pound? As
Gertrude Stein suggested in "Composition as Explanation," every art
work is new by definition when it first appears, simply because it did
not exist before. The concept of "make it new" seems useful to the
extent that it suggests that works of literature should be as complex
as their times. But such a suggestion does not imply that such works
must be "improvements" of previous literature in order to be
significant. To the extent that "make it new" suggests that literature
needs to progress or improve in order to be significant, the concept
imposes linear progress on the much more varied complexities that
works of literature embody. 

 <p> 5) It is only when subjected to the
notion of progress that the word "derivative" takes on the negative
connotation it currently has when applied to literature. To call
something "derivative" is to say that it has not progressed. But some
level of imitation in literature and art is unavoidable. Rather than
condemning all imitation as lack of novelty, it might be more
insightful to think of the complex ways in which new works of
literature and art are influenced by what has come before them, and to
consider the extent to which new works imitate or do not imitate
previous works as one response to the particular problems they face in
their inevitable newness. Isn't honesty and complexity of perception,
partly original, partly borrowed, and however embodied in the form of
literature, the goal even of new forms of writing, indeed the impetus
for new forms, and more important than the desire to simply present
something new? Isn't the value of all new forms not simply that they
are new, but that they can allow art to embody complex and changing
perceptions?
 
<p> 6) Historically, one primary difference between the lyric and
other types of western poetry has been the nature of address. The
lyric often speaks to another person (in some case perhaps a group of
persons) very specifically, rather than addressing the world in
general, or a particular culture, as does epic poetry or the modern
American "poem with history" (Ezra Pound's <i>Cantos</i>, Charles Olson's
<i>Maximus Poems</i>, Louis Zukofsky's <i>A</i> as some founding examples). The
history of lyric address is entirely troubling, perhaps most
thoroughly in its frequent objectifying of the person being spoken
to. Yet I am also troubled by the address of the American "poem with
history." In many founding examples, the voice of the "poem with
history" is that of the public, rational, totalizing "objective"
man--never emotional, never private, never irrational or partial.
	
<p>I am interested in the way the lyric suggests that address needs to
be understood as specific, however troubling the specific address of
specific lyric poems may be. The possibility that address might be
understood valuably as specific leads me to an insight that causes me
both pain and elation; that I am partial, that is to say, not total,
and specifically interested. I am crucially interested in the question
of who might hear me, and who, in turn, I might possibly hear. I want
to contact others who are also partial. 

 <p> 7) If there is one thing
I find most troubling about the founding examples of the modern
American "poem with history," it is the assumption that a totalized
view of the world--which usually implies a total containment of it--is
possible. Whether this total containment attempts to present itself as
coming from beyond the limits of partiality (Pound, who finally
recognized the impossibility of his attempt--for which we owe him
thanks) or from inside some specific but totalizing mythic stance
towards the world (Olson's <i>Maximus</i>, although Olson, in creating a
stance out of action towards the world rather than knowledge of it,
does simultaneously undermine his totalizing stance), I nonetheless
suspect that the desire for totalization may emerge at least as much
from the desire for control as it does from the desire for
liberation. Would not a desire for liberation want to see endless
partial stances towards the world, abrupt and glorious contradictions,
the repeated shifting of positions, the chance to change your mind on
the slightest whim? Would not a desire for liberation suggest that any
total view of the world might change at any moment?  

<p> 8) In recent
non-mainstream poetics, it has been typical to point out that the
lyric has been used by many poets and critics as a genre with socially
recalcitrant features, perhaps the most basic feature of which is a
transcendent, unified subject. For instance, in <i>The American Poetry
Wax Museum</i>, Jed Rasula points out that in the work of critic Charles
Altieri, the "lyric's duty" becomes "the emotional maintenance of a
self beset by inopportune neediness" (Rasula 329). Rasula shows also
how the notion of a transcendent, unified subject as the basic
characteristic of lyric poetry has appeared in the work of Robert
Pinsky and Daniel Hoffman (325-326, 347). Rasula does not share this
essentialzing view of lyric, pointing out for instance that Adorno's
essay "On Lyric Poetry and Society" wants "to preserve lyric as a site
of struggle." (88) But Rasula's book does not follow through on the
notion of continued possibilty for lyric, partly because his book's
intentions lie elsewhere, but also perhaps partly because the "narrow
proscenium of the lyric" (326) may seem too thoroughly contaminated by
its misuses to be of continued value, a position commonly taken by
much avant garde theorizing.

	<p>However, the lyric does not necessarily have a
transcendent, unified subject as one of its basic characteristics, and
various lyrics and hybrid forms of lyric have already abandoned this
notion of the subject. In my own work, and that of some others, the
"subject" voice of the lyric often makes clear its own partiality,
lack of transcendence, and situational, contingent existence. In such
a poetry, the "voice" of the poem becomes not a predetermined given
but precisely a site of social and material struggle in the way that
Adorno's work suggests it might. 

 <p> 9) I wonder about the gender
implications of the lyric and the epic. As Rasula and others have
pointed out, the lyric voice has often been understood as a dominantly
male way of approaching and objectifying experience. Yet it might be
argued that the lyric has become a repressed mode of discourse in a
avant garde context in which the "poem with history" has been seen
often as a necessary corrective to many troubling uses of lyric. In
such a context, it's important to note that lyric's concern with the
"emotional" does not have to be understood by definition as a
displacement of the objective material conditions of one's
circumstances onto an often hysterical subjectivity. Such a narrow
notion of the "emotional" can easily, and unfortunately, refigure
itself as a dominant avant garde mode in which the partiality of
"emotional" response is understood merely as a lack of rigorous
thinking, that is, as something which historically has often been
associated with feminine behavior and phsyiology. Rasula, for
instance, repeats this reductive and gendered view of emotion when he
speaks of the failure of "low mimetic realism" as its "unexamined urge
to find the soft emotional center of its issues" (Rasula 393).

	<p>To what extent is it accidental that in the canon of
western literature, the poet taken to be the crucial founding voice of
the lyric (Sappho) is female, while the poet taken to be the crucial
founding voice of the epic (Homer) is male? In many of her poems,
Sappho specifically rejects the universalizing male warrior code of
Homer, replacing it with concern for the more ordinary and local
emotions of people around her. What does one make of the fact that the
American "poem with history" has been, until recently, with some
exceptions a relentlessly male project? Could the answer be as simple
that, historically, women usually have been denied the education that
would enable them to write a poetry of complex historical reference?
Or is it that such "historical reference" usually has meant reference
primarily to male historical activity? Is the lyric really
insufficient to handle post-structuralist problems? Isn't it true that
a whole host of factors, economic, behavioral, conventional and other,
have influenced both men's and women's choices to make use of lyric,
epic, or the "poem with history"?
	<p>I am interested in exploring the possibility of the
feminine in my writing (at the very least, exploring its impossibility
in my writing) as a way to make a problem of masculinity in writing,
which I do not reject but am interested in questioning. If in that
questioning I find I want to reject masculinity as it is currently
defined, I reserve that possibility, as I would reserve the
possibility of rejecting current definitions of the feminine. The
lyric has seemed one way of exploring gender dynamics in my writing,
because it allows me to explore issues of my own partiality, a
partiality which may use "emotion" as a multiplicity of legitimate
responses to material stimuli, and not simply as the unconscious,
degraded other of rational thought. 

 <p> 10) Uses of the "poem with
history" in the twentieth century have been complex and incisive, and
the "poem with history" continues to offer valuable possibilities for
avant garde exploration. As Joan Retallack has pointed out, writers
such as Stein, H.D., Abba Kovner, Susan Howe, Rosmarie Waldrop,
Marlene Nourbese Philip, Kamau Brathwaite, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and
Retallack herself have all refigured the "poem with history" for a
variety of necessary uses (Retallack). Anne Waldman's Iovis, Retallack
argues, discusses directly the gender dynamics of the "poem with
history" by both acknoweldging and challenging the "epic masters"
Williams, Pound, Zukovsky, and Olson (Retallack).

	<p>It is important, also, not to oversimplify the nature of
address in male use of the poem with history. Zukofsky's hermeticism
in A, for instance, thoroughly complicates the issue of whether his
address is public. Ron Silliman's long poems always complicate the
nature of address. And much of the male "poem with history" is weaved
through with an intense lyricism; think of the role lyric plays in
both The <i>Cantos</i> and <i>A</i>.
	<p>However, uses and refigurings of the lyric have been
equally as complex as that of the poem with history. Consider the uses
of lyric, of interpersonal or "subjective" concerns, or of and the
narrative "I," all of which critique in various degrees the notion of
a transcendent subject, in the work of Frank O'Hara, James Schuyler,
Allen Ginsberg, Bernadette Mayer, Kathleen Fraser, Alice Notley, Lyn
Hejinian, Hannah Weiner, Lee Ann Brown, Susan Schultz, Elizabeth
Burns, Jean Donnelly, Jennifer Moxley, Lisa Jarnot and many others. I
am interested in undermining the general dichotomy of address between
the lyric and the "poem with history" because of the ways in which
challenging limited notions of address, whether of the lyric or of the
"poem with history," can create a more specific understanding of who
poetry can reach and why. Why not use both the tradition of the lyric
and of the "poem with history" to explore complex social and aesthetic
questions?

  <p> 11) If a social collectivity of experimental artists
and others interested in those experiments can have any effect on the
social dynamics of the present moment, such effect must be active on
the level of day-to-day, specific encounters between individuals, and
must arise out of the perceived concerns of those individuals on a
highly specific, day-to-day basis. Any attempt to impose a totalized
collectivity is, I think, doomed to failure. I am reminded here of
Gramsci's concept of "organic intellectuals," whose ideas and concerns
arise from direct material contact with all the complexities of their
environments. Such intellectuals form direct relations with others,
out of which collectivity can perhaps emerge.

	<p>Although it seems to me that only large collectivities of
such artists could help counteract their decreasing power to influence
western culture, I am skeptical about the possible existence of many
such collectivities, or of their ability to gain power. As a book like
Guy Debord's <i>Comments on the Society of the Spectacle</i> (a later
reflection on his well-known text of 1967) makes perfectly clear,
optimism about the possibility of change may be a great mistake, may
in fact even prohibit its successful realization, if it is not
entirely prohibited already.

	<p>Yet I don't want my skepticism to stand in the way of
achieving meaningful social collectivity, should it be possible. In a
society in which useful discussion about the relation between
individuals and groups almost never takes place, I'm willing to
concede that my own thinking on this subject may not be sufficiently
complex. In that insufficiency, refigurings of lyric address have
allowed me a mode of writing through which to think towards
significant contact with others. But at this point in time I, like
many others perhaps, have little or no such contact.

 <p> 12)
Refigurings of the lyric mode have helped me write a "situationally
specific" poetry, one that deals with material, interpersonal,
political, detailed situations in as specific a manner as
possible. This was one of the primary intentions of my books
<i>Complications From Standing In A Circle</i> and <i>Every Day Is Most of My
Time</i>. I wanted to write a poetry that was as materially specific,
localized, and partial as I could. I am aware that there can be a huge
gap between what one wants to write and what one writes.  

<p> 13) My
sense of lyric as partial, specific, situational, contingent and local
in no sense suggests that I think of lyric as "local color", that is,
as presenting a "slice of life" for audience satisfaction. Rather, it
seems to me that in addressing, responding to, recognizing others in
the most specific possible way, the refiguring of lyric I am
suggesting presents a mode of world address that is potentially more
useful than a more generalized, public address that speaks at (and
therefore past) everyone. The sense of lyric I am suggesting here
potentially provides direct and meaningful material contact much of
the sort that William Carlos Williams was striving for when he began a
magazine called <i>Contact</i>. The possibility of this contact, theorized in
relation to Gramsci's concept of "organic intellectuals," is one
aspect of the lyric mode that has a definite social and collective
significance. Again, however, I can't avoid my skepticism about the
extent of that significance.  

<p> 14) According to many strict
definitions of lyric poetry, I have, in fact, written very few lyric
poems. In my work, languages of politics, technology, media deception
and credentialed "expertise" frequently disrupt any attempt to
narrowly define the subject matter or narrative voice of the "lyric
poems" I have written. But even a lyric poem that fit past definitions
of the lyric might be interesting, and I have written some such
poems. I see no necessary opposition between the personal and the
political, the confessional and the collective, the enacted and the
theoretical. But I do see that overly narrow definitions of these
possibilities dominate discussions of poetry at this particular
time. I see more danger in overly narrow definitions of form and genre
in poetry than I do in any form itself. Forms and genres are
possibilities, and as such, it always remains to be seen what can be
done with them.
