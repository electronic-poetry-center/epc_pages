<blockquote>
JABBER produces nonsense words that sound like English words, in the way that the portmanteau words from Lewis Carroll's <i>Jabberwocky</i> sound like English words. <p>

When a letter comes into contact with another letter or group of letters, a calculation occurs to determine whether they bond according to the likelihood that they would appear contiguously in the English lexicon. Clusters of letters accumulate to form words, which 
results in a dynamic nonsense word sound poem floating around on the screen with each iteration of the generator.<p>

JABBER realises a linguistic chemistry with letters as atoms and words as molecules.<p>

<strong>Notes:</strong><p>

<ol>
<li>Blue words are word fragments (or entire words)</li>
<li>Green words are compound words created from two blues ones.
<li>Red words are garbage words that will explode.
<li>The <i>output</i> button will toggle a text box containing all words produced by the generator. To get rid of the output box, hit the <i>output</i> button </li> again and it will disappear).
