<P>While working on a lipogrammatic project, I needed to look up the meaning of 
the i-only word 'bilinigrin', which was found by a PERL script looking through a 
word list. I could not find a reference to 'bilinigrin' in the online Oxford 
English Dictionary or the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. I entered the word 
in the Lycos search engine, and several of the links it returned had highly 
unusual descriptions, like the following:</P>

<P>When I followed the link to http://www.unixguru.org/list-archives I found myself 
browsing through an entire website filled with this kind of writing, formatted 
as web pages with hyperlinks, paragraphs and bulleted lists, but with utterly 
nonsensical and totally fascinating text like the following:</P><B><FONT

<P>The text's formal properties recall many of those found in the poetry of 
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writers. Grammar is eschewed, so that no meaning accumulates in 
the text: "Grammar precludes the possibility of meaning being an active, local 
agent functioning within a polymorphous, polysemous space of parts and 
sub-particles, it commands hierarchy, subordination and postponement" 
(McCaffery, <I>North of Intention</I> 98). Rare and archaic words abound, which 
recalls McCaffery's 'Lastworda' from <I>Theory of Sediment</I>. With a 
preponderance of medical and scientific terms, words from vastly different 
registers find themselves thrown together like in much of Bruce Andrews' work. 
Reading these web pages provides a pleasure in the materiality of the signifier 
like that experienced when reading L=...=E poetry.</P>
<P>After reading through numerous pages, and looking at the rest of the unixguru 
site, I could not determine why this panoply of bizarre web pages were written. 
None of the rest of the material at unixguru suggested that the list archives 
were of a literary nature. I contacted Grant Miller, the webmaster at unixguru, 
and asked him what list could produce such archives? He responded that the web 
pages were not written as the product of any list archives, but were in fact 
written by a computer program called Sugarplum. Devin Carraway, the creator of 
Sugarplum, explains its raison d'être:</P></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sugarplum is an automated spam-poisoner [spam is unsolicited email 
advertising]. Its purpose is to feed realistic and enticing, but totally useless 
or hazardous data to wandering address harvesters such as EmailSiphon, Cherry 
Picker, etc. The idea is to so contaminate spammers' databases as to require 
that they be discarded, or at least that all data retrieved from your site 
(including actual email addresses) be removed.<BR><BR>
Sugarplum employs a combination of Apache's mod_rewrite URL rewriting rules 
and perl code. It combines several anti-spambot tactics, includling fictitious 
(but RFC822-compliant) email address poisoning, injection with the addresses of 
known spammers (let them all spam each other), detection of so-called "stealth" 
spambots that masquerade as legitimate browsers, and, optionally, the activation 
of firewalling or launch of denial-of-service attacks intended to crash the 
spambot's machine, thus momentarily deferring the threat 
(Carraway).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The web pages appeared under the sub-directory 'list-archives' at the 
unixguru site in order to lure spambots into Sugarplum's trap. In the readme 
file, amongst a list of the anti-spam methods the program uses, is a statement 
of the poetics of Sugarplum:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Avoid counterdetection (letting the spambot know it's being poisoned) by 
rendering output in a fashion as close to normal human output as automatically 
feasible (even repeatable output, if deterministic mode is used). This involves 
variable HTML syntax and content, extensive randomization, vague attempts at 
grammar, etc. The primary assumption in this respect is to assume that the 
author of the spambot is at least as smart as you are -- and that it will notice 
any tricks obvious enough that you yourself could pick them up 
(Carraway).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Detractors of L=...=E poetry might find Carraway's statement of Sugarplum's 
poetics an accurately reductive dismissal of the work of L=...=E writers: close 
to normal human output, with extensive randomization and vague attempts at 
grammar.</P><B>
<P>Sugarplum Politics</P></B>
<P>One of the abiding concerns of L=...=E poets has been to fight the reference 
fetish in capitalist language formations: "The referential fetish in language is 
inseparable from the representational theory of the sign. Proposed as 
intentional, as always 'about' some extra-linguistic thing, language must always 
refer beyond itself to a corresponding reality" (McCaffery, <I>North of 
Intention</I> 152).</P>
<P>Sugarplum confounds the reader’s fetish for reference by planting imaginary 
email addresses, preventing the reader from reaching beyond language to anchor 
itself in a proper name from the extralinguistic world.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To demystify this fetish and reveal the <I>human</I> relationships involved 
within the labour process of language will involve the <I>humanization </I>of 
the linguistic Sign by means of a centering of language within itself; a 
structural reappraisal of the functional roles of author and reader, performer 
and performance; the general diminishment of reference in communication and the 
promotion of forms based upon object-presence: the pleasure of the graphic or 
phonic imprint, for instance, their value as sheer linguistic stimuli 
(McCaffery, 'Intraview' 189). [emphasis mine]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sugarplum reconfigures the author/reader functional roles and accomplishes 
the general diminishment of reference through a <I>mechanization</I> of the 
linguistic Sign, where each word's only value and function is that of sheer 
linguistic stimuli for its <I>mechanical</I> reader.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unlike most programs, wch are self-limiting, that of writing in the framework 
of capitalism carries within itself the admonition, typical of an economy 
predicated on technical innovation &amp; the concentration of capital, to ‘make 
it new’. The function of a truly political writing is to, first, comprehend its 
position (most explicitly, that of its audience) &amp; to bring forth these 
‘new’ meanings according to a deliberately political program (Silliman, 
168).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sugarplum’s technical innovation creates new meanings with every execution of 
its deliberately political programming.</P>
<P>On the ubu mailing list, Darren Wershler-Henry called attention to "an 
overanxiety among the Language poets about 'fetishizing' the text in any way, 
which resulted in weirdly puritanical-looking books." The book, which is the 
vehicle for the vast majority of L=...=E poet’s texts, is subject to 
fetishization regardless of the design. The small press editions of L=...=E 
texts published 20 years ago find themselves fetishized just like any other 
limited print run of poetry that is subsequently both studied and highly 
regarded. L=...=E poetry may counter capitalism in its textuality, but it does 
not counter capitalism in its production and dissemination: "any poem which 
adopts 'book' as its vehicular form must admit its complicity within a 
restricted economy" (McCaffery, 'Blood...' 176).</P>
<P>Sugarplum participates in a general economy of waste by producing voluminous 
texts meant to be ignored. If the texts are successful at thwarting spambots, 
Sugarplum will achieve its own apotheosis and never be read by human or machine: 
a completely unproductive expenditure that never enters into exchange. 
Sugarplum’s texts directly counter capitalist forces within their medium of 
exchange. </P>
<P>In spite of the pretences of many L=...=E writers, their texts <I>always</I> 
participate in a restricted economy, because there is a use value in terms of 
cultural capital. Reading their work accumulates the capital required to write 
essays in journals, which accrues academic benefits. Spending hours reading 
Sugarplum is a glorious waste of time.</P>
