mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Kurt Schwitter’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ursonate</i>
sound poem is ostensibly nonsense, however it still sounds German. Even when
trying to create nonsense, we unconsciously fall into the comfortable
linguistic patterns of our mother tongue. When we hear language that we
recognize as our own, the semantic is only one effect that signals familiarity.
If common syllables of English are combined in a random fashion, the results
are still recognizable as English.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The most prominent example of this phenomenon in
English is Lewis Carroll’s ‘Jabberwocky’ from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Through the Looking Glass</i>, which also provides the most common
model for the creation of neologisms. Alice is bewildered by the poem, and
turns to Humpty-Dumpty to help her interpret the hard words. She asks him what
slithy means, and Humpty-Dumpty responds: “Well, ‘SLITHY’ means ‘lithe and
slimy’. ‘Lithe’ is the same as ‘active’. You see it’s like a portmanteau—there
are two meanings packed up into one word”. The portmanteau word is a mixture of
bits and pieces of multiple words that are put together in a manner that
conforms to the rules of English word formation. The words are pronounceable
and familiar, although their meaning must be guessed at through a whimsical
etymology (a ’patymology, perhaps).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>That Humpty-Dumpty must also define ‘lithe’, one of
the constituent words of ‘slithy’, is significant in that it demonstrates that
the effect of neologism is present whenever we encounter any unfamiliar word.
The words of our language have been naturalised so that we have a comfortable
relation to a fixed set of letter combinations. Neologism disrupts this
familiarity. JABBER codifies and automates the disruption of neologism so that
each iteration of the generator provides a further estrangement from our
language. The unfamiliar smuggled into our language in the guise of the
familiar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>JABBER falls somewhere between the sound poetry of 
    Schwitters and the nonsense poetry of Carroll: the words are assembled from 
    bits of other words as in ‘Jabberwocky’, but like the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The analogy between the formation of words and the
formation of chemical compounds has a long tradition in Western philosophy. In
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Theatatus</i> Socrates relates:
“Methought that I too had a dream, and I heard in my dream that the primeval
letters or elements out of which you and I and all other things are compounded,
have no reason or explanation”. Although the letter has no reason or
explanation, laws exist to combine them to form compounds. The chemical analogy
is embedded within the Greek language: “The Greek word for alphabet, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stoicheia</i>, also carries the meaning <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>elements</i> with all the cosmological
associations of that term. For the Greeks, the letters had an atomistic and
elemental character. The letters were indecomposable: there was no smaller,
more significant, or more basic elements of the cosmic order. It was from these
units that the material form of the universe, and the natural world, was
constructed” (Drucker, <i>The Alphabetic Labyrinthe</i> 111).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Lucretius makes a similar analogy, but to different
ends: “At a key moment in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>De Rerum Natura</i>
Lucretius draws the analogy between atoms and letters. In Book One he explains:
‘basic bodies take a certain structure, / And have defined positions, and
exchange / Their blows in certain ways. The same bodies, / With only a slight
change in their structure, / Are capable of forming wood or fire. / Like
letters in the words for these same things, / Ignes and lignum: with slight
transpositions, / They can be nominated ‘flames’ or ‘beams’. ’ Atoms then are
to bodies what letters are to words: heterogeneous, deviant, and combinatory” (McCaffery
&amp; Rasula, <i>Imagining Language</i> 532).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>JABBER falls somewhere between the determined world 
    of Plato and the indeterminate world of Lucretius: the indivisible letters 
    constantly enact Lucretius’ minimal swerve of the clinamen in their random 
    meanderings, yet when they collide they follow the laws of combination like 
    the compounded elements of Plato. JABBER uses letter-atoms to form the word-molecules 
    of an alien world whose language is English spoken through a fun-house telephone.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The 40 phonemes of English are represented by
combinations of 26 letters, and these combinations are governed by
transcriptions of spoken language. This over-simplifies the complex historical
processes of orthography, but it is the implicit assumption of an ahistorical
investigation of orthography, as Bök tells us: “Serres argues that all laws for
combining (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foedera coniunctorum</i>) only
arise after the fact of combining (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coniuncta
foederum</i>) so that, in effect, the detection of order is simply the
hindsight of chaos: ‘The laws of nature come from conjugation; there is no
nature but that of compounds. In the same way, there are the laws of putting
together letters-atoms to produce a text. These laws, however, are only
federation. The law repeats the fact itself: while things are in the process of
being formed, the laws enunciate the federated’” (Bök, <i>'Pataphysics: The
Poetics of an Imaginary Science</i> 95 n.14).The laws for combining letters
inhere as latent information in the words in the lexicon – information that can
be retrieved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Once the laws are discovered, new words can be
synthesised. Serres provides an uncanny description of JABBER in operation:
“The alphabetical proto-cloud is without law and the letters are scattered at
random, always there as a set in space, as language; but as soon as a text or
speech appears, the laws of good formulation, combination, and conjugation also
appear” (qtd. Bök 84).The lexicon contains the laws of good combination, and
JABBER learns and then applies those laws to the alphabetical proto-cloud to
fill in the gaps between the words in the dictionary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>RACTER is one of the most famous Natural Language Generators, 
    and the author of the only book entirely written by a computer, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Policeman’s Beard is Half-Constructed</i>. 
    JABBER operates similarly to RACTER: whereas RACTER combines words according 
    to grammatical rules to produce sentences, JABBER combines letters according 
    to lexical rules to produce words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <h4><span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Writing<o:p></o:p></span><o:p></o:p></h4>

  <p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>When a class in the Girls’ Latin 
    School in Boston asked Carroll’s permission to name their school magazine 
    <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Jabberwock</i>, he replied:<o:p></o:p></p>

  <p class=MsoBodyText2 style='margin-left:.5in'>Mr. Lewis Carroll has much pleasure 
    in giving to the editors of the proposed magazine permission to use the title 
    they wish for. He finds that the Anglo-Saxon word ‘wocer’ or ‘wocor’ signifies 
    ‘offspring’ or ‘fruit’. Taking ‘jabber’ in its ordinary acceptation of ‘excited 
    and voluble discussion,’ this would give the meaning of ‘the result of much 
    excited discussion.’ Whether this phrase will have any application to the 
    projected periodical, it will be for the future historian of American literature 
    to determine. Mr. Carroll wishes all success to the forthcoming magazine.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>In the poem “Jabberwocky” the
result of the result of much excited discussion is that the excited discussion
is slain. In a less torturous syntax, what is most remarkable about the
portmanteau Jabberwocky is that Carroll destroys it. That this is so should
come as no surprise, since it accords with the long-standing interpretation of
the relationship between Lewis Carroll’s fantasy and Charles Dodgson’s logic:
Carroll’s fantasy is the grotesque result of not attending to the laws of
Dodgson’s logic. The dangerous terrain of nonsense is only traversed to
reinforce the safe domain of sense.</p>

  <p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>The first stanza of Jabberwocky 
    was written by Carroll many years before the Alice books, and published in 
    one of the private periodicals he created for his nieces and nephews as “A 
    Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry”:<span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>And the mome raths outgrabe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>The stanza contains 10 nonsense 
    words, and in his original explanations of the words, only a few of them are 
    portmanteaus. The rest are pure inventions. Tove is not derived from any other 
    words, and in Carroll’s explanation is “a species of Badger. They had smooth 
    white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag; lived chiefly on 
    cheese”. The word tove has no etymology to authorize this interpretation, 
    and exists as a creature of pure fantasy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>When we examine the poem
Jabberwocky, we see that the density of nonsense words in the first stanza
(which is repeated as the last stanza) is far greater than that of the
remainder of the stanzas. In fact, if we include the title of the poem in the
count for the first stanza we get 11, which is equal to the total number of new
nonsense words introduced in the next 5 stanzas. So we go from a density of 11
nonsense words in the first stanza, to an average of just over two nonsense
words per stanza in the remainder of the poem. Of the 11 nonsense words in the
remainder of the poem, seven of them are adjectives, one is an adverb, and 3
are nouns.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>After reading the poem, Alice
claims “Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas – only I don’t exactly know
what they are! However, somebody killed something: that’s clear, at any rate”.
We are not surprised that Alice figures out the action in the poem, because
after the first stanza she has to contend with so few nonsense words, and more
than three quarters of them are adjectives. The first and last stanza are the
ones that fill her head with unknowable ideas, and it is the middle that brings
Alice clarity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>In Martin Gardiner’s excellent
annotated edition of Alice’s adventures, he claims “few would dispute the fact
that ‘Jabberwocky’ is the greatest of all nonsense poems in English” (192). I
must count myself among those few. If Carroll’s poem is so great a work of
nonsense, why is there so little nonsense in it? In fact, if we compare the
structure of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Through the Looking Glass</i>
the book with that of ‘Jabberwocky’ the poem, we see that the looking glass
poem is in fact the inverse image of the book. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Through the Looking Glass</i> Alice begins in the sensible world,
enters the nonsense world, and then returns to the sensible world. In
‘Jabberwocky’ we begin with nonsense, then enter into a world of sense where
nonsense is killed, and then end with the castrated repetition of nonsense.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>The only glimpse we have of a
looking glass language occurs in the first and last stanzas of Jabberwocky.
What I propose to do in my current writing project is transform <i>Through the
Looking-Glass</i> into <i>Through the Larfing-Grell</i> by replacing every
non-deictic word in the looking glass world into looking glass language. Then
Alice’s journey into nonsense will be mirrored by the transition to the
language of nonsense. Each replacement word will share formal properties with
its source word: it will begin with the same letter, have the same number of letters,
and the same number of syllables. But it will be a nonsense word produced by
the JABBER engine. And not the sensible portmanteau words like ‘slithy’, but
the nonsense of ‘toves’.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Logic of Sense</i> Gilles Deleuze identifies the most common creators
and users of portmanteau words as poets, children, and madmen, and asks how can
we justify this grotesque trinity? His description of the problem acts as an
uncanny description of the project of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Through
the Larfing Grell</i>: “the problem is a clinical problem, that is, a problem
of sliding from one organization to another, or a problem of the formation of a
progressive and creative disorganization. It is also a problem of criticism,
that is, of the determination of differential levels at which nonsense changes
shape, the portmanteau word undergoes a change of nature, and the entire
language changes dimension” (83).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:.5in'>Lewis Carroll may have killed
the Jabberwocky, but with the JABBER engine and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Throught the Larfing Grell</i> I am resurrecting the Jabberwocky to let
it run amok.</p>
