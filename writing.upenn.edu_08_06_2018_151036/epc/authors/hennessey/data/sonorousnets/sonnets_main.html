      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During quotidian interactions 
        with the Internet we see only meaningful text written by humans. Beneath 
        the surface of every transaction that travels through the channels of 
        the Internet-- whether it's sending an e-mail, loading a web page, or 
        encrypting a message-- is a massive amount of alphabetsam. Readable, meaningful 
        text is always accompanied by a barrage of networking codes and handshaking 
        protocols that only have meaning to the machines they are communicating 
        with. If the Internet could talk, a third of what it would say would be 
        meaningless.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most familiar place where 
        letters are combined in ways that almost destroy the possibility of producing 
        meaning is the automatically assigned e-mail address. Usually 8 letters 
        long, companies or schools use them to ensure uniqueness. They are produced 
        using algorithms that combine initials and last names, most often coming 
        up with an unrecognizable new moniker that bears some resemblance to the 
        original. For example, my name is Neil Hennessy, and the e-mail address 
        I was assigned by my school is nhenness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presented here are 4 poems 
        that use automatically generated e-mail addresses to approximate what 
        the Internet might sound like if it spoke in sonnets.</font></p>
