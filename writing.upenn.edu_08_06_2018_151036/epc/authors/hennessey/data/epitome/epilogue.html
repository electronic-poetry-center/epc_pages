  <p class=MsoNormal>On discovering the formula that provides the title to this 
    book, Leonhard Euler declared “It was like looking at a proof that God exists.” 
    The formula can be derived from De Moivre’s Theorem by using the constant 
    <img src="pi_glyph.gif" width="11" height="9"> in place of the variable x.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><img width=143 height=93 src="epitome_derivation.gif"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The result, which serves no practical purpose in
mathematics, nevertheless connects in a succinct and direct relation “the five
most important constants in mathematics ... [which] symbolize the four major
branches of classical mathematics: arithmetic, represented by 0 and 1; algebra,
by i; geometry, by pi; and analysis [calculus], by e” (Maor 160). Each of these
branches of mathematics were considered separate disciplines, and the discovery
of such an astonishing result showed the interconnectedness of all mathematics.
The proof contains no theological elements, but the result appeals as mystic
evidence.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mathematics 
    and the Imagination</i> makes a grand claim for Euler’s result: “There is 
    a famous formula - perhaps the most compact and famous of all formulas - developed 
    by Euler from a discovery of De Moivre: <img src="formula_small.gif" width="65" height="18">. 
    It appeals equally to the mystic, the scientist, the philosopher, the mathematician” 
    (Kasner &amp; Newman). Those 4 groups of people can make for strange bedfellows, 
    and in this book they are joined by a fifth - a poet - where their interests 
    intersect at this most unique formula that epitomizes all of mathematics.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The initial inspiration that lit this author’s lamp was born 
    of a simple desire: to create a poem with a more strict <img src="pi_glyph.gif" width="11" height="9">-based 
    constraint than Oulipian author Jacques Bens used in his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>41 
    Sonnets Irrationels</i>. Bens used the decimal expansion of <img src="pi_glyph.gif" width="11" height="9"> 
    to govern the number of lines per sonnet in his 41 sonnets. In order to create 
    a more rigid constraint, I let the decimal expansion of <img src="pi_glyph.gif" width="11" height="9"> 
    govern the number of syllables in a line, and used the additional vocabulary 
    constraint that every word had to contain the letter sequence “pi” in it.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>Faced with a paucity of appropriate proper nouns, I relied 
    on what the Oulipians call a deportmanteau word, which is a single word divided 
    into constituent words through etymology, tmesis, or a more whimsical operation. 
    In this way pithy became pi thy. Consequently, the structuring element of 
    the text became the subject of the text itself: I was using <img src="pi_glyph.gif" width="11" height="9"> 
    to create formal constraints in an ode to <img src="pi_glyph.gif" width="11" height="9">.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The e poem is a univocal lipogram constructed using words 
    containing the vowel e to the exclusion of all other vowels. Like the <img src="pi_glyph.gif" width="11" height="9"> 
    poem, each line of the e poem contains the same number of syllables as the 
    decimal expansion of e. In addition, each line contains the same number of 
    e’s as the decimal expansion of e. This restriction excludes words like “here”, 
    “where”, and “there”, since they have more e’s than syllables. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The i poem for the imaginary constant is also a univocal
lipogram. If the lines are numbered 1,2,3... each line <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>n</i> has one word, with the same number of i’s as the minimum power of
i that equals i<i><sup>n</sup></i>. This takes
advantage of the cyclical exponentiation of i, which is demonstrated as
follows:</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><img width=224 height=231
src="imaginary_cycle.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1046"></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The powers of i only represent 4 unique numbers, and so the
poem follows the exponentiation of i by cycling the number of i’s on each line
through 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...</p>
