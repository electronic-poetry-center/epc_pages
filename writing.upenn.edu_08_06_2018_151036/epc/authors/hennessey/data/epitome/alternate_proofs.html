<p class=MsoCommentText><b>Alternate Proofs</b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Is mathematics invented or discovered? The conviction that 
  mathematical objects have an existence independent of any individual provides 
  the last refuge for Platonism. The astonishing power and beauty of mathematics 
  led the first mathematician to believe that it was discovered. Pythagoras declared 
  &quot;the universe is number.&quot; Mathematics discovered facts about the very 
  substance of the universe. To Pythagoras, numbers were restricted to ratios 
  of whole numbers. The first crisis in mathematics occurred when it was proven 
  that the diagonal in a square could not be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers, 
  which was a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem. The knowledge was scandalous, 
  since it eroded Pythagorean ontology. Legend has it that when Hippasus revealed 
  this discovery to the Greek world, Pythagorus killed him. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The numbers that could not be expressed as ratios of whole 
  numbers came to be called irrational. Each time new numbers were needed to solve 
  particular problems in mathematics, their existence was doubted, but they eventually 
  became incorporated into mathematics. When mathematics required the use of the 
  roots of negative numbers, their existence was called into question, but they 
  eventually became incorporated as the imaginary numbers.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Each time mathematics experiences a crisis, the mathematical 
  expands to include what was previously considered non-mathematical, and then 
  the universe is again number. Any disturbances in mathematics get smoothed over, 
  so that Platonists can claim the a posteriori coherence of mathematics was a 
  priori all along. However, attention to the poetic ironies of mathematics betrays 
  its ontological crises. Mathematical certainty is heralded as the paragon of 
  logical rationality, but its crises leave a paradoxical linguistic residue.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The Queen of Science is irrational, imaginary, incomplete, 
  and undecidable.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The same poetic irony is present in the symbol for equality, 
  which first appeared in Robert Recorde's <i>The Whetstone of Whitte</i> in 1500: 
  &quot;And to avoide the tediouse repetition of these woordes: is equalle to: 
  I will sette as I doe often in woorke use, a paire of parralles, or Gemowe lines 
  of one lengthe, thus: <span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>=, </span><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-CA'>bicause noe 2, thynges, can be moare equalle.&quot; The advent of non-Euclidean 
  geometries demonstrated that those 2 thynges can be not equal, which negates 
  the very authority of the equal sign. Hence, we can say unequivocally<o:p></o:p></span></p>
