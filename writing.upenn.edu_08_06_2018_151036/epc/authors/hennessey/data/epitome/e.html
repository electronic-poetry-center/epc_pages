7   behest beset best bet be
1   e.
8   we express excellent excess
2   when we
8   pen clever cleft clenches, tender
1   the
8   perfect entendres. the present
2   verses
8   select the present verb tenses,
4   yet they never
5   stress even metres -
9   they prefer e-meter fetters.

4   Feckless plebs spew
5   genre best-sellers;
2   they set

5   trends when they blether -
3   we effect
6   the excepted legends.

2   When we
8   render the e<sup>x</sup>pend sketch, the swell's
7   essences ever extend,
4   yet when we drew
7   the swept length's segmented depth
1   we
3   kept the set
5   bend. Kepler's crescents
2   reflect
6   the telemeter's lens,
6   then Legendre metres
2   the crest's
4   flex; Engels helps
9   excerpt, then renew Hegel's tenets:
7   whenever shrewd descendents
7   select precedent elder's 
5   best elements, then
7   extend yet reject
2   the terms,
4   they strengthen the
7   better emergent theses.

9   Sempstresses lengthen mended dress hems, 
3   then the lewd 
6   men get less leg. Stern shrews 
9   reject lechers, they select decent 
9   well-bred respected gentlemen, then 
9   hen-peck them when they wed. Temptresses 
5   redden the flesh, then 
9   the wretches' bent members swell erect. 
5   The fervent perverts 
7   screw the wenches, the peckers' 
4   testes spend sperm, 
9   then when they get herpes they regret 
6   the repellent sex. The 
6   genders repress the flesh, 
9   yet the menses she secreted, the 
6   semen he ejected, 
7   the feces they expel, the 
6   phlegm they retch (the wet 
2   excess 
7   essences) effervesces; 
7   when they smell the excrement, 
2   the flesh 
4   reprehends them.

3   Hermes the
5   Messenger sent the
3   letters, then
5   legends engender
4   texts. He kept the
7   brethren's sceptre, the
5   herdsmen's peg. Western
9   vespers refresh the medleys Shepherd's
4   glens knew. Hermes
5   helps mercers sell
7   velvet dresses, crew neck vests;
1   yet,
3   whenever
8   he helps jewellers peddle gems
2   he helps
1   the
7   jewel-theft. When the settlers'
8   vessel left the tempest, Hermes'
5   help set the helm's next
2   berth (they
5   better respect the
1   crew's
6   strength, lest they rebel)
6   When the settlers retrench
4   the expenses
2   they spent,
7   Hermes' hex settles the bets.
4   Whenever serfs
2   thresh the
7   leys they tend, Demeter helps
4   them get betel,
6   cress, fennel. Ceres' fresh
6   herbs perfect the chef's stew,
3   ferment the
9   keg's brew. Then when the servers held the
1   fest,
9   the well-fed threshers chew the resplendent
3   refreshments,
2   then belch.
