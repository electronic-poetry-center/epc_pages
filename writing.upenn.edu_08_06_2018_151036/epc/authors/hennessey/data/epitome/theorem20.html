<p class=MsoNormal>The Oulipo did much to thematize the connections between literature 
  and mathematics, and the Oulipian Jacques Roubaud describes how the method of 
  constructing mathematical texts can be used in poetic composition: “A constraint 
  is an axiom of a text. Writing under Oulipian constraint is the literary equivalent 
  of the drafting of a mathematical text, which may be formalized according to 
  the axiomatic method” (Roubaud 89). The axiomatic method in mathematics and 
  formal logic establishes axioms that consist of a set of symbols, a set of valid 
  combinations of the symbols, and rules to transform valid combinations of symbols 
  to other valid combinations of symbols. A combination of symbols is a theorem. 
  A theorem is proven true if you can start from an axiom and apply a series of 
  transformation rules to arrive at the theorem.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The rigorous theory of the axiomatic method took place as a 
  development in the ongoing search for the foundations of mathematics that arose 
  after the 19th century crisis. Until the 19th century geometry had been the 
  most secure and certain knowledge of which philosophy could boast. The theory 
  of geometry had been handed down unchallenged for thousands of years through 
  Euclid's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Elements</i>. In the 19th century 
  one of Euclid's postulates gave way. The parallel postulate states that &quot;Through 
  a given point, only one line can be drawn parallel to a given line.&quot; In 
  the first quarter of the century three different mathematicians (Gauss, Bolyai, 
  Lobachevsky) created geometries that denied the fifth postulate, and became 
  convinced that the non-Euclidean geometries did not lead to contradiction. This 
  knowledge was scandalous, and Gauss hesitated to publish his results. Some extremely 
  important and useful results required the parallel postulate, including the 
  Pythagorean theorem. The scandal waited in the wings until Beltrami proved in 
  1868 that Lobachevsky's non-Euclidean geometry was as consistent (ie. free from 
  contradiction) as Euclidean geometry. Mathematics until that point had Geometry, 
  now it had geometries. Mathematical research in the 19th century shook the two 
  thousand year old geometry at its roots, and the crisis arose with the loss 
  of confidence in the oldest and surest form of mathematics.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Due to the privileged place accorded to geometry in philosophy, 
  the crisis was more than mathematical, it shook the entire epistemology of Western 
  thought:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>The situation was intolerable because geometry had served, 
  from the time of Plato, as the supreme exemplar of the possibility of certainty 
  in human knowledge. Spinoza and Descartes followed the 'more geometrico' in 
  establishing the existence of God, as Newton followed it in establishing his 
  laws of motion and gravitation. The loss of certainty in geometry was philosophically 
  intolerable, because it implied the loss of all certainty in human knowledge. 
  (Hersh 15)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>The crisis inaugurated the search for the Foundations of Mathematics, 
  which aspired to provide a single theory from which all of mathematics could 
  be derived. The first comprehensive attempt at providing foundations came by 
  way of Gottlob Frege's logicism. If geometry could no longer be counted on to 
  ground all of mathematics, then perhaps logic could do so. The sure footing 
  for mathematics would be found in the logic of sets. Unfortunately for Frege, 
  just as he was about to publish the final volume of his series of works on the 
  foundations, Bertrand Russell showed how Frege's theory contained a paradox, 
  known commonly as Russell's paradox or the Barbers paradox.</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>A man of Seville is shaved by the Barber of Seville if and 
  only if the man does not shave himself.<br>
  Does the Barber of Seville shave himself? (Russell, ctd. Bunch 86)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>If the Barber of Seville shaves himself, then he must be a 
  man who does not shave himself, which is a contradiction. If the Barber of Seville 
  does not shave himself, then he must be one of the men who is shaved by the 
  Barber of Seville: another contradiction. Russell translated this paradox into 
  Frege's formal system at its roots, and thus dismantled it, since any logical 
  system that permits contradictions to be derived from its axioms can be used 
  to prove contradictory statements like &quot;1=2&quot;. Mathematics clearly 
  cannot admit such statements. Frege went through with the publication of his 
  foundations, but wrote in a postscript to the final volume: &quot;Just as the 
  building was completed, the foundation collapsed&quot; (Frege).</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead attempted to fill 
  the cracks in Frege's foundations by reformulating the concept of sets to exclude 
  the Barber paradox, which led to the publication of their magnum opus <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principia Mathematica</i>. The title echoed 
  the single most important scientific publication to that date, Newton's <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>, 
  and its aims were as ambitious in mathematics as Newton's were in physics, to 
  revolutionize and ground their respective sciences. Although noone found any 
  paradoxes in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principia</i>, most mathematicians 
  considered the machinery used to eliminate the Barber paradox to be unjustifiable 
  and obscure, involving constructions that strayed far from logic and any certainty 
  it provided.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>David Hilbert responded to the problem by shifting the focus 
  to mathematical methodology and began the study of the axiomatic method itself, 
  which came to be known as metamathematics. He advocated a formalism that reduced 
  mathematical activity to manipulating a set of symbols according to rules stated 
  as axioms. Any mathematical theorem was then either an axiom, or it was deducible 
  from the axioms by following a series of valid applications of the transformation 
  rules. In this way checking the validity of a theorem's proof would be equivalent 
  to checking that a series of mechanical manipulations of symbols followed the 
  rules. By reducing mathematics to the study of formal systems, Hilbert sought 
  the same end as Leibniz with his Universal Characteristic: &quot;For then reasoning 
  and calculating would be the same thing&quot; (Leibniz, ctd Derrida 78). Hilbert 
  believed that through this method mathematics could be shown to be complete 
  (every theorem could be proven true or false), and consistent (no theorem can 
  be both true and false, ie. no paradoxes). The effort undertaken to do so is 
  known as Hilbert's program. Unfortunately for Hilbert, Kurt Godel imported a 
  version of Epimenedes' Liar Paradox into Russell &amp; Whitehead's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principia 
  Mathematica </i>to show that mathematics could not be proven both consistent 
  and complete.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Epimenedes the Cretan said: &quot;All Cretans are liars.&quot; 
  Is Epimenedes a liar? If Epimenedes the Cretan is telling the truth, then all 
  Cretans are not liars, and Epimenedes is lying, which is a contradiction. If 
  Epimenedes is lying, then not all Cretans are liars, so the statement he made 
  is true. A better formulation of the paradox was given by Eubulides: &quot;This 
  statement is false&quot;. Godel brought Epimenedes to bear on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principia 
  Mathematica</i> by translating the Liar paradox into a theorem to say &quot;This 
  theorem is not provable.&quot;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>If the assertion &quot;This theorem is not provable&quot; is 
  false, then there are theorems that are false and provable (mathematics is inconsistent). 
  If the assertion is true, then there are theorems that are true and not provable 
  (mathematics is incomplete). Faced with the choice, mathematicians chose incompleteness. 
  To choose inconsistency, where a theorem can be proven both true and false, 
  would be to countenance proofs that &quot;1=2&quot;, and this way lies madness. 
  The consequence of the incompleteness of mathematics is that there are undecidable 
  propositions: theorems that are true, but cannot be proven from the axioms.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>These paradoxes involve an intrusion of one order of signification 
  into another, where an element considered on the outside is smuggled to the 
  inside, forming a vicious circle due to self-referentiality. Paradoxes are turned 
  into fallacies by denying the premises from which they issue; this death of 
  the paradox is necessary, for each time a paradox is reached in mathematics, 
  we glimpse the death of the system. Mathematics retreats from the death of reason, 
  for with it goes all truth. Opposed to mathematics, poetics seeks out and revels 
  in the death of language, in the dissolution of the reading subject in a paradox 
  of signification.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Pleasure of the 
  Text</i>, Roland Barthes theorizes the reader who seeks the dissolution of his 
  subjectivity in the reading act by opposing the texts of a comfortable pleasure 
  with the texts of a rapturous jouissance:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>Texts of pleasure: the text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; 
  the text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a 
  <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>comfortable</i> practice of reading. Text 
  of jouissance: the text that imposes a state of loss, the text that discomforts 
  [...], unsettles the reader's historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, 
  the consistency of his tastes, values, memories, brings to a crisis his relation 
  with language. Now the subject who keeps the two texts in his field and in his 
  hands the reins of pleasure and jouissance is an anachronic subject [...]: he 
  enjoys the consistency of his selfhood (that is his pleasure) and seeks its 
  loss (that is his jouissance). (14)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>While reading a text of pleasure, the reader participates in 
  creating meaning and narrative, which constitutes their subjectivity within 
  a discourse. When the materiality of the text insists upon itself through various 
  methods of linguistic excess, the illusion of discourse dissolves and we lose 
  meaning as a settled given. When we are forced out of participating in a discourse, 
  we become the text's voyeur, similar to the effect that occurs in reading when 
  I say to you that the word at the end of this sentence is meaningless. Mathematics 
  seeks out its paradoxes to eliminate the loss they incur, while poetics seeks 
  out its paradoxes to revel in the loss they produce:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>Paradoxes are recreational 
  only when they are considered as initiatives of thought. They are not recreational 
  when they are considered as &quot;the Passion of thought,&quot; or as discovering 
  what can only be thought, what can only be spoken, despite the fact that it 
  is both ineffable and unthinkable-a mental Void (Deleueze 75).</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>For Bertrand Russell, paradoxes are the &quot;Passion of thought&quot;:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>I wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people want 
  religious faith. I thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics 
  than elsewhere. But I discovered that many mathematical demonstrations, which 
  my teachers expected me to accept, were full of fallacies, and that, if certainty 
  were indeed discoverable in mathematics, it would be in a new field of mathematics, 
  with more solid foundations than those that had hitherto been thought secure. 
  But as the work proceded, I was continually reminded of the fable about the 
  elephant and the tortoise. Having constructed an elephant upon which the mathematical 
  world could rest, I found the elephant tottering [by arriving at paradoxes], 
  and proceeded to construct a tortoise to keep the elephant from falling. But 
  the tortoise was no more secure than the elephant, and after some twenty years 
  of very arduous toil [which encompassed the arrival of Godel's results], I came 
  to the conclusion that there was nothing more that I could do in the way of 
  making mathematical knowledge more indubitable (Russell).</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>For Roland Barthes, paradoxes are recreational initiatives 
  of thought:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>Imagine someone [...] who abolishes within himself all barriers, 
  all classes, all exclusions, not by syncretism but by simple discard of that 
  old specter: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>logical contradiction</i>; 
  who mixes every language, even those said to be incompatible; who silently accepts 
  every charge of illogicality, of incongruity; who remains passive in the face 
  of Socratic irony (leading the interlocuter to the supreme disgrace: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>self-contradiction</i>)[...]. 
  Such a man would the mockery of our society: court, school, asylum, polite conversation 
  would cast him out: who endures contradiction without shame? Now this anti-hero 
  exists: he is the reader of the text at the moment he reaches jouissance. Thus 
  the Biblical myth is reversed, the confusion of languages is no longer a punishment: 
  the text of jouissance is a sanctioned Babel. (3)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>The Oulipian formulation of Hilbert's program for literature 
  has clear and distinct limits, for the analogy of drafting a mathematical proof 
  according to the axiomatic method and a poetic text according to constraint 
  can only be carried so far:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>[E]ven if the 'axioms' of an Oulipian constraint may be established 
  with sufficient precision (as in the case of the lipogram), what will play the 
  rather primordial role of deduction in mathematics? What is an Oulipian demonstration? 
  One may think that a text composed according to a given constraint (or several 
  constraints) will be the equivalent of a [proof of] a theorem. It is a fairly 
  interesting hypothesis. It is nonetheless true that the foreseeable means of 
  passage from the statement of the constraint to its 'consequences', the texts, 
  remains in a profound metaphorical vagueness (Roubaud 89).</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>Mathematical proofs are teleological, whereas poetic texts 
  are not. The profound metaphorical vagueness separates mathematics and poetry 
  at the site of their paradoxes. Hence, by inspection</p>
