<p class=MsoCommentText><b>Theorem 2.1</b></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Hilbert's program failed to provide a secure foundation for 
  mathematics because the axiomatic method is not an adequate account of mathematical 
  truth. The upshot of Godel's incompleteness theorem is that there will always 
  be true theorems in mathematics that are undecidable in the system because they 
  cannot be proven from its axioms. When a theorem is undecidable within a formalization, 
  it cannot be proven true or false, so mathematicians must decide whether to 
  add the theorem or its negation as an axiom.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Hilbert's formalism fails to provide an adequate philosophy 
  of mathematics, for it ignores how mathematicians actually write and do mathematics. 
  Mathematicians do not follow the axiomatic method when publishing proofs of 
  theorems. Proofs are written with a mixture of natural and formal language. 
  According to Hilbert's formalism</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>[t]he authenticity of a mathematical proof is established by 
  verifying that a sequence of atomic symbol strings is legitimate. In point of 
  fact, proofs are not written in terms of atomic symbol strings. They are written 
  in a mixture of common discourse and mathematical symbols. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Definitions</i> are made to serve as abbreviations 
  for longer combinations of words and symbols [...] <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Corollaries</i> are introduced for the psychological 
  lift of obtaining deep theorems cheaply. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Splicing</i> two theorems is standard practice. In the course of a proof, 
  one cites Euler's Theorem, say, by way of authority [...] If splicing is common 
  to lend authority, then skipping is even more common. By skipping, I mean the 
  failure to supply an important argument. (Davis 171)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>As an example of a proof--which will 
  forego all the above shortcuts with the exception of definitions--take Euclid's 
  proof of the Prime Number Theorem.</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>Definition: A number is prime if it has no divisors, eg. 2, 
  3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Definition: A number is composite if it can be divided by prime 
  numbers, eg. 6 (2 x 3), 9 (3 x 3), 30 (2 x 3 x 5).</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Theorem: There are infinitely many prime numbers.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Proof: Assume, on the contrary, that there are not an infinite 
  number of primes. With a finite number of primes, there must be a last prime, 
  call it N. Multiply all the primes from 1 up to N together, call that number 
  P:</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>1 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 9 x 11 x ... x N = P</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Now add 1 to P. Is P + 1 composite or prime? If we divide P 
  + 1 by any of the primes that preceded it, we are left with a remainder of 1. 
  So P cannot be divided by any of the primes that preceded it, so P + 1 is prime. 
  This contradicts our assumption that there are not an infinite number of primes. 
  If an assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false (mathematics retreats 
  from paradox). So we conclude that there are in fact an infinite number of primes.</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>Euclid's proof is regarded as one of the most beautiful proofs 
  in mathematics. When proofs are short and incorporate ingenious reasoning, they 
  are said to be elegant and beautiful. Just as poets are esthetes of language, 
  mathematicians are esthetes of reason:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's 
  must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colors or the words must fit together 
  in a harmonious way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Beauty is the first 
  test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics. (Hardy)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>Aesthetics are the epistemological foundation of mathematics. 
  The truth of a proof relies on the beauty of its argument: &quot;Beauty is the 
  <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>first test</i>.&quot; To understand the 
  implication of that statement, we need to visit the mathematician at the moment 
  he takes his pleasure, we must become voyeurs.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Jacques Hadamard's study <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The 
  Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field </i>divides the methods of 
  the creative mathematician into 4 stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, 
  and verification. When trying to prove a theorem, the preparation stage involves 
  studying the problem with intense concentration, and considering the use of 
  various approaches common in the field. Once the problem is thoroughly understood, 
  and known approaches have been exhausted, the mathematician may experience a 
  sense of anxiety or frustration at being unable to attack the problem head on, 
  deductively. The second phase of incubation begins, where the mathematician 
  lives with the problem and allows unconscious processes to operate. If the mathematician 
  is lucky, illumination occurs, which is a momentary flash of insight that provides 
  the solution.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The illumination does not appear while the mathematician is 
  thinking about the problem directly. Hadamard tells the story of Henri Poincare, 
  who worked arduously at a problem for months without any success. The moment 
  of illumination arrived while on vacation: &quot;Poincare was not working when 
  he boarded the omnibus of Coutances: he was chatting with a companion; the idea 
  passed through his mind for less than one second; just the time to put his foot 
  on the step and enter the omnibus.&quot; (Hadamard, 31).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
  </span>In that moment of illumination, in that fraction of a second when the 
  solution presents itself unexpectedly, that is where beauty serves as the first 
  test of truth. The solution to the proof does not appear to the mathematician 
  as a chain of deductions, with the moment of illumination occurring at the last 
  axiomatic transformation. In the moment of illumination, the entire solution 
  can be checked in an instant, through a mental process similar to the pattern 
  recognition involved in recognizing someone's face.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The last phase of invention is verification, which is when 
  the mathematician writes out the deductive<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
  </span>argument whose structure appeared in the moment of illumination. This 
  can be a long and arduous process, but deductive reasoning cannot begin until 
  after the mathematician's intuition has provided the solution. This written 
  argument has to allow the reader to get the same insight as the author &quot;all 
  at once&quot;:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, every mathematician knows that a proof has not been 
  'understood' [or verified] if one has done nothing more than verify step by 
  step the correctness of the deductions of which it is composed and has not tried 
  to gain a clear insight into the ideas which have led to the construction of 
  this particular chain of deductions in preference to every other one. (Bourbaki)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>To this end, proofs must be short to be grasped. Philip Davis 
  has noted that overly long proofs have a lesser chance of being verified correctly: 
  &quot;Proofs cannot be too long, else their probabilities go down, and they 
  baffle the checking process.&quot; (173) We have seen that beauty is the first 
  test of truth, and both the beauty and truth of a proof are proportional to 
  its length. Beauty and truth are so intertwined that all mathematicians' espouse 
  Keats' maxim without the slightest trace of irony:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all<br>
  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>The literary analogue for the work of the creative mathematician 
  while trying to prove a theorem would not be a text written according to Oulipian 
  constraint. It would begin with the poet reading a triple-decker detective novel, 
  at the end of which the poet is convinced he knows the killer. Upon discovering 
  in a moment of illumination the irrefutable pattern that connects the evidence 
  to convict the killer, the poet inscribes the elegant proof as a haiku in the 
  margin of the last page.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Against Hilbert's emphasis on mathematical discourse, the mathematician 
  Philip Brouwer focuses on mathematical intuition: &quot;The first act of intuitionism 
  completely separates mathematics from mathematical language, in particular from 
  the phenomena of language which are described by theoretical logic, and recognizes 
  that intuitionist mathematics is an essentially languageless activity of the 
  mind&quot; (Brouwer 141-2).</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Jacques Hadamard's survey of mathematicians in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Psychology of Invention </i>largely confirms 
  that mathematical intuition is a languageless activity, and subsequent writers 
  have been content to cite him in this regard. Language only enters the scene 
  after the moment of illumination. The movement from intuitive revelation to 
  deductive reason is seen as the movement from spirit to body:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>Mathematical objects are perceived by the soul. (Plato)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>[H]ow does geometrical ideality (just like that of all the 
  sciences) proceed from its primary intrapersonal origin, where it is a structure 
  within the conscious space of the first inventor's soul, to its ideal objectivity? 
  In advance we see that it occurs by means of language, through which it receives, 
  so to speak, its linguistic living body. (Husserl 161)</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>Our souls perceive metaphysical objects, and then language 
  makes them physical. This passage is necessary for the mathematician to verify 
  his results, but it comes with some anxiety: &quot;The process of verification 
  can be very painful: one's terribly afraid of being wrong&quot; (Connes). Language 
  enters the scene as the Law, disciplining insight according to the dictates 
  of deductive reasoning.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>At the conclusion of his study, Hadamard declares &quot;In 
  conformity with a rule which seems applicable to every science of observation, 
  it is the exceptional phenomenon that is likely to explain the usual one&quot; 
  (136). In taking his advice with regards to his own text, we find ourselves 
  confronted with exceptional mathematicians who do use language in the process 
  of creative mathematics.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Jessie Douglas provides Hadamard's first exception: &quot;Jessie 
  Douglas generally thinks without words or algebraic signs. Eventually, his research 
  thought is in connection with words, but only with their rhythm, a kind of Morse 
  language where only the numbers of syllables of some words appear.&quot; Language 
  in Douglas' research thought loses all semantic effects in preference to its 
  rhythmic properties. By noting only the syllables of a string of words, Douglas 
  performs a mathematical analysis of language, abstracting a pattern from the 
  sensual phenomena. This pattern is nothing but poetic meter.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Hadamard devotes more space to the second exception:</p>
<blockquote><p class=MsoNormal>G. Polya's case [...]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is 
  different. He does make an eventual use of words. &quot;I believe, [...] that 
  the decisive idea which brings the solution of a problem is rather often connected 
  with a well-turned word or sentence. The word or sentence enlightens the situation, 
  gives things, as you say, a physiognomy. It can precede by little the decisive 
  idea or follow on it immediately; perhaps it arises at the same time as the 
  decisive idea... The right word, the subtly appropriate word, helps us to recall 
  the mathematical idea, perhaps less completely and less objectively than a diagram 
  or a mathematical notation, but in an analogous way... It may contribute to 
  fix it in the mind.&quot; Moreover, he finds that a proper notation - that is, 
  a properly chosen letter to denote a mathematical quantity- can give him similar 
  help; and some kind of puns, whether of good or poor quality, may be useful 
  for that purpose. For instance, Polya, teaching in German at a Swiss university, 
  usually made his junior students observe that z and w are the initials of the 
  German words &quot;Zahl&quot; and &quot;Wert&quot;, which precisely denote the 
  respective roles which z and w play in the theory which he was explaining.</p></blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal>The language that proves effective in aiding the creative mathematician 
  in the incubation stage is 'well-turned', and 'subtly appropriate', its most 
  concrete exemplar being a mathematical pun. To understand how well-turned phrases 
  and puns aid Polya in his mathematical research, we must turn our attention 
  to the role analogy plays in mathematics.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Polya provides a definition in his book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Induction and Analogy in Mathematics</i>: &quot;two systems are analogous, 
  if they agree in clearly definable relations of their respective parts&quot;. 
  In talking of specialization, generalization, and analogy, Polya posits analogy 
  as the most essential operation in mathematics: &quot;There is perhaps no discovery 
  either in elementary or in advanced mathematics or, for that matter, in any 
  other subject that could do without these operations, especially without analogy.&quot; 
  Many of the most astonishing proofs in mathematics connect disparate systems 
  through analogy so that once the necessary features of the systems are shown 
  to be analagous, a problem in one discipline of mathematics can be solved using 
  methods of another discipline. A pun creates an analogy between the system of 
  expression and the system of semantics. The pun posits a clearly defined relation 
  between the sonic or visual form of words and their meanings: a creative mathematics 
  of language. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The language present for Douglas and Polya while the creative 
  mathematician is at work in the business of mathematical intution is not the 
  formal language of mathematical discourse, but the fanciful language of poetic 
  play. Not the axioms and inferences of verification, but the puns and rhythms 
  of versification. The reason? Polya's puns are more mathematical than Hilbert's 
  axioms. Hence, by inspection</p>
