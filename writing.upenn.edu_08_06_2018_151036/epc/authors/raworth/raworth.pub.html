Tom Raworth was born and grew up in London.  During the 1970s he
traveled and worked in the United states and Mexico, returning to
England in 1977 to be Resident Poet at King's College, Cambridge, in
which city he still lives.  Since 1966 he has published more than 40
books and pamphlets of poetry, prose and translations, in several
countries.  His graphic work has been shown in France, Italy, and the
United States, and he has collaborated and performed with musicians
(Steve Lacy, Jo&euml;lle L&eacute;andre, Steve Nelson-Raney, Esther Roth, Nino
Locatelli), painters (Giovanni D'Agostino, Mica&euml;la Henich), and other
poets (Franco Beltrametti, Corrado Costa, Dario Villa).  In 1991 he
was invited to teach at the University of Cape Town: the first
European writer to visit there for thirty years.  <p>
