<br>
<br> though it might have been chronic 

  
<br>
around his neck and shoulders
<br>
filled with thick high weeds 
<br>
the road was lined with stone<p>

almost entranced she started 
<br>
ordering quantities of everything 
<br>
down the windows of your station 
<br>
combed and perfectly normal<BR>
<p>
bees through blood and perhaps 
<br>
night air while we rode back 
<br>
followed him to the front porch 
<br>
and the chimney bricks were fallen<br>
<p>
she hasn't heard from him since 
<br>
filled in on the background       
<br>
large machines can dig them 
<br>
forced to take shelter in that house<br>
<p>
watching her move about the kitchen 
<br>
a uniformed policeman was standing 
<br>
out like magic on the glass 
<br>
we were living under siege again<br> 
<br>
two more men came in carrying 
<br>
pages of an appointment book 
<br>
not very good lights things happening 
<br>
younger all clean and prosperous <br>
<p>
a grievance a legitimate grievance 
<br>
rumbled as the rain began 
<br>
heavily where the blades pushed it 
<br>
round doorways little brown children<br>
<p>
in your car and go somewhere 
<br>
dead or senseless at the wheel 
<br>
crouched there taking no part 
<br>
on the highway the sedan fishtailed<br>
<p>
mosquitoes had been real fierce 
<br>
with that wind coming off 
<br>
substandard materials and workmanship 
<br>
years of polishing have dulled<br>
<p>
professional sound of a woman singing 
<br>
damnation at an empty chair
<br>
soft black soot coats the slate 
<br>
too splendidly suburban for adequate<br>
<p>
illegible smears of block printing 
<br>
held motion to a crawl 
<br>
skimming over book titles 
<br>
postured alluringly around the room<br>
<p>
the important dynamic was between 
<br>
peculiar and unique powers 
<br>
to collect on his insurance 
<br>
that portion of it reported<br>
<p>
lovely little thing with eyes 
<br>
as efficient as she had to be 
<br>
shambling on down the tissue 
<br>
range where embers had gone out<br>
<p>
looking at everything said suicide 
<br>
the area about her had the look 
<br>
you see in old chromos 
<br>
breathing not daring to smoke or cough<br>
<p>
practically an abandoned road 
<br>
several varieties of mushroom thrived 
<br>
standing motionless in the shade 
<br>
small common objects of assault<br>
<p>
blown cell with a dusty bulb 
<br>
an instant to blank shining glass
<br>
blocking out the moon and stars 
<br>
vending machines on every floor
