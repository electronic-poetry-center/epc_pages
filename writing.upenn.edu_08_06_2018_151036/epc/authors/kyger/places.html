This is the ghost one I was referring to.<p>

<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">My Place was loosing the<br>
great beauty that came on horse reaching out to me as I lay<br>
locked, no I won't and running after, I want I want.  Nearly<br>
falling like a ghost, telling it like a ghost, becoming wet.<br>
Waiting.
<p>
I'll take it out again, the asking for candy and sweet in<br>
the woods where they go.  I know of course, and can't get<br>
through, just skating on thin ice out of danger bringing them<br>
candy and sweet away from the toes, being caught.
<p>
So then there seemed to be many things.  She almost caught<br>
me, as I looked up and was falling or I was looking down and<br>
was falling.  This was there worry.
<p>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">I didn't know how far<br>
it could extend, where ever the first move is to be made.
<p>
They hammer on the trees in the woods &nbsp;&nbsp;those boys, wearing<br>
white shirts, and guns.

Now it sours.  The things I made, I guess, are all a result,<br>
held away, the latter portion blooms.<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">Evelyne watched all<br>
the way through, the medium, rattling around, how, was it being<br>
sized up, when it is being left, unattended.<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see now<br>
whay I cut it away and called it my own.  They were cut away, the<br>
swhole world blooms.  I cut the dead branch off the honeysuckle,<br>
it started out last June going halfway up the porch.
<p>
It is better now the dead portion is cut away.  It is still<br>
true that I can fold, I mean the room can tilt, but half and<br>
hald, that's how it blooms.
<p>
I don't know it exactly, but he was struck blind when women<br>
had pleasure the most that they did not want to hear; or saw<br>
wrongly.  Was he born one way and then the other.  But he knew<br>
both as a man, lay dying, along the stream of blood to talk.
<p>
One side sleeps, the other awakes.  I would not worry of dream,<br>
if I were you.  It does not lurk, Saying it now, if you care to<br>
remember, oh, Did I say that?
<p>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows what they want.  They<br>
can plan it out and get thta beautiful construction, I mean<br>
mine is the most beautiful but I never get what I want.  You<br>
can't put the rocks in your <i>mouth</i> on the seashore, rub them<br>
in your eyes.

<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">Came up on a horse.  Those <br>
days were like breaking through sunlight, where the sand would<br>
bite at the feet.  God is with you.  I do poems before I go<br>
to sleep, these are dream poems, there is Snow White's bottom.
<p>
How high are the fences around?  There are still areas to<br>
play in, washing hair, poor Joanne.  Margaret took her first<br>
bite by herself.
<p>
And the terrible boredom, waiting, in the sun, with a house<br>
folded of cardboard and crayon people against the walls.  Carrots<br>
the girl next door, and we ate them.
<p>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif"><img src="blankbig.gif">Also the stone road goes
<br>
down perilously, the same pier awash, the water slide into the<br>
deep depths.
