"Oh Man is the highest type of animal existing<br>
&nbsp; or known to have existed<br>
<img src="blank.gif"> but differs from other animals<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more in his extraordinary mental<br>
&nbsp;development than in anatomical<br>
structure . . ."<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif">Well when I think of men<br>
<img src="blank.gif">I think of then in a sexual manner<br>
Otherwise, I don't notice the difference, you know
<p>
being absorbed as <i>being</i> &nbsp;one just thinks 'people'<br>
and not 'male' and 'female' so much as someone<br>
to talk to. And how men are all
<p>
the same being born from Man and Woman and out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of a woman's body commonly known as 'Mother.'
<p>
"And God said let us make MAN in our own image,<br>
&nbsp; after our likeness and let them have dominion."
<p>
<img src="blank.gif">And "Nature may stand up<br>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp; and say to all the world,<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;'This was a MAN!'"
<p>
<img src="blank.gif">And then "I pronounce you MAN<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and wife."
<p>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">Daddy you is dandy
<p>
when you're here.  Shrill and soft old Autumnal
<p>
<img src="blank.gif">wind blow &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and we are tucked below
<p>
the shallow soil where seeds spring<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp; up and wither quickly<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif">flirting madly.
<p>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got him now,
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the beautiful one for my part
<p>
of the year here in my dark<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif">&nbsp;and expensive underground<br>
<img src="blank.gif">&nbsp; all mine before he is shared
<p>
and killed again by the fearless boar<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif"> he is hunting and torn apart<br>
and his blood runs out and red roses and anemones
<p>
bloom &nbsp;&nbsp; and it is spring &nbsp;&nbsp; and<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is gone again
<p>
That man about town gone again . . .
