DESCARTES AND THE SPLENDOR OF
<p>
<i>A Real Drama of Everyday Life.</i>

In Six Parts.

PART IV
<p>
I reject as absolutely false all opinion in which I have the least doubt.<br>
As our senses often deceive us I assume they show us illusion, and must<br>
reject them.  As reason is subject to error, and who can offer more living<br>
proof of that than I, I must reject the faculty or reason.<br>
Finally I am aware that I am only <i>completely</i> and <i>confindently</i> aware of<br>
all this rejection and doubt.  This is all I can be sure of, this spinning out<br>
of my head.  HENCE I arrive at my First Fundamental Truth.  I THINK<br>
hence I AM.  OR I Doubt hence I Am; or I Reject hence I am. You get<br>
the picture.<br>
However this <i>I</i> is of the Mind, and wholly distinct from the Body.  But<br>
then further clear reasoning brings me to this: IN ORDER TO THINK,<br>
IT IS NECESSARY TO EXIST.  I never saw a dead man think, I never<br>
hope to see one, but I can tell you any how, I'd rather see than Be one.<br>
Dead men don't htink.  An therefore, everything we exactly and truly<br>
know, like THE REASONING ABOVE is because it is CLEAR AND<br>
DISTINCT.
<p>
I realize that to doubt is a drag, and a PerFECT BEING would accept<br>
everything.  But from WHENCE DID I GET MY IDEA OF<br>
PERFECTION!!!!! PLACED IN ME BY A NATURE, BY A NATURE<br>
IN REALITY MORE PERFECT THAN MIND and WHICH EVEN<br>
POSSESSES WITHIN ITSELF ALL THE PERFECTION OF WHICH<br>
I COULD FORM ANY IDEA, that is to say, IN A SINGLE WORD,<br>
<i>MOTHER GOD.</i><br>
Without this idea of the perfection of MOTHER <i>GOD</i> we should not exist.
<p>
Imagination is a mode of thinkin lomited to material objects.  AND THE<br>
STUFFY MIND ASSUMES IF YOU CANNOT IMAGINE, something,<br>
IT DOES NOT EXIST. WHICH IS beside the point and off the argument<br>
if not completely irrelevant to this text by which I am following myself<br>
in glory and splendor.  AM I A BUTTERFLY DREAMING I AM ME<br>
or ME DREAMING I AM A BUTTERFLY or am I MOTHER <i>GOD</i><br>
in Glory and Splendor?  Our ideas become confused because we are not<br>
WHOLLY PERFECT and our razor sharp reason must be wielded at all<br>
times to guard against ERROR, error of IMAGINATION and error of<br>
the SENSES.
