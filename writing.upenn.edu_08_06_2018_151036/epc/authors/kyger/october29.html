In a crowd of people I am suddenly elevated.  No matter that<br>
the crowd follows Ginsberg and Snyder, out on a quick<br>
demonstration march thru the halls of a tall building out<br>
into the gardens, their faces among the trees as little<br>
Chinese sages grained into the wood.  White walls, somewhat<br>
Grecian in the fancy takes you.  I AM ELEVATING! from a <br>
cross legged position, I rise slowly off the ground in a<br>
crowd of people, easy as can be.  ELEVATED! Mr. Ginsberg<br>
and Mr. Snyder frown, not so much? As they are on their busy<br>
way, as groups of people pour their respect and devotion to-<br>
wards them.  Pour, pour-they're busy drinking it up all day<br>
in teacups. Do you think we've sent these young ladies and<br>
gentlemen in the right direction? That is to say, haven't<br>
we sent thin in the right direction though.<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif"> With my back against a stone wall<br>
in a courtyard, I am closing my eyes and-Now if you will<br>
just observe me, I will move up off the ground, hopefully<br>
as much as a foot, two feet, grind. In my Tibetan bathrobe.<br>
Silence.
