Into the party, with engraved invitations, I am bored when<br>
I realize the champagne in the decrepit bowl is going to get<br>
filled up a lot. Well then, on the greens in front of the<br>
Mansion are walking Tom Clark and Ted Berrigan, what chums!<br>
Do you think I could possibly fall in step, as they turn same<br>
to far flung university on horizon, gleaming.  You bet your<br>
life not. The trouble, says Ted, with you Joanne, is that<br>
you're not intelligent enough.<br>
