<hr>
<p>
<img src="blank.gif">In the time of the ancients<br>
the earth went dark for 5 days<br>
and they broke many pots<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the pots spoke<br>
And the demons in the dark came forth<br>
<img src="blank.gif">from them:<br>
The lion, the snake, the jaguar<br>
And the people perished from them.
<p>

The little children sprouted wings.<br>
<img src="blank.gif">"You will die mother".<br>
And the child went outside<br>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp; at once<br>
And changed into a bird<br>
<img src="blank.gif">And the children survived.
<p>

At dawn, no single person<br>
<img src="blank.gif">left alive<br>
Only birds,<br>
Jay, woodpecker, sparrow . . .
<p>

The the people were <i>transformed</i>.  They were good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again.  The sun came out<br>
<img src="blank.gif"> in the soft white radiance.<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">And our father in heaven came down<br>
to make some other people<br>
<img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp; First from clay
<p>

<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif"> But they couldn't move well<br>
and he destroyed them again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulverized the clay<br>
and prepared the clay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and made the clay alive.<br>
And looked for food for them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they didn't like the grasses<br>
he gave them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so he gave them<br>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the delicious part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of his thigh<br>
And they fought trying to take it away<br>
<img src="blank.gif"> from eachother.<br>
"It must be that they like my body then"<br>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said our father.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the clay<br>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif"> began to talk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and became human<br>
one part man, one part woman.
<p>
Helloooooooooo

Are you here now?<br>
I am here now
<p>
Are you here?<br>

<p>

<p>
Will you drink a little<br>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to sweep away the fear?<br>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Breathing the gods, getting the goods

I dreamed I went to see the officials<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of our town<br>
<img src="blank.gif"> They were seated at a long table<br>
<img src="blank.gif"> I was handed a basket<br>
<img src="blank.gif"> Inside the basket were many flutes<br>
I chose one,<br>
<img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one that was not too new.<br>
I had been given the soul of the flute<br>
<img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif"> That is how I can play<br>
<img src="blankbig.gif"><img src="blank.gif"><img src="blank.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp; the flute today<br>
