The ventilator<br>
blades are tired  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of lifting dust over<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these lifeless objects<br>
objects in disuse.exhaling.restlessness.<br>
on a sinuous street an abandoned store<br>
and it's June it's called paradise.<br>
pressed against the window I'm chewing straw <br>
and see nothing specific definable: nothing costly<br>
the point being not to die not to see<br>
a boredom that once pertained to light<br>
stains here and there<br>
no one knows what of.<br>
spent &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; timeworn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
nothing costly<br>
waiting for a buyer to come: useless garment<br>
my left breast out from under my blouse<br>
there's a whetstone.<br>
the rats watch us, distrust us, watch us<br>
their reddish eyes behind a cardboard box.<br>
items that meant something once<br>
simulation. ovation.<br>
the melody is mediocre &nbsp;  a music blending<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; droning<br>
to complaints from the fan<br>
blades shuddering against themselves.  something moves<br>
seems to move.<br>
old lamps old artifice: nothing costly<br>
mirrors only images<br>
the opaque mercury against the eye of a previous object.<br>
we are sick of the performance and the indemnity.<br>
the street sinuous: storefront. monte street. paradise.<br>
setting down the second-hand store that allured me<br>
ok I was looking<br>
but now nothing's antique not even<br>
the proximity of their forms to curb the illusion<br>
among so many objects of no use no destiny<br>
resigned to their silent routine <br>
when not<br>
otherwise piled together<P>
