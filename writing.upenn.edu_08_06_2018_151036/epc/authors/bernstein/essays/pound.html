      <p><b><font size="4">Introduction to Ezra Pound, from <i>Poetry Speaks, 
        </i>ed. Elise Paschen, Rebekah Presson Mosby (Sourcebooks, 2001)</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="4">Charles Bernstein</font></b></p>
      <p>Ezra Pound is one of the most ambitious, influential, and innovative 
        poets of the modernist period (the first half of the 20th century). Pound 
        made significant contributions to American poetry not only as poet but 
        also as a translator, editor, polemicist, and essayist. </p>
      <p>Pound’s poetics had a profound influence on both the poets and readers 
        of his generation. He was a primary proponent of other modernist writers, 
        including Yeats (who served as a model for him), Eliot (with whom he edited 
        “The Waste Land”), James Joyce, William Carlos Williams, and H.D., and 
        poets of the next generation, such as Louis Zukofsky and Basil Bunting. 
        Pound strenuously attacked the prevailing verse styles of his time, which 
        he found flabby and vague. Such verse, he said, had lost its musicality 
        because of its lock-step adherence to metrical structures that substituted 
        the regularity of the metronome for the intricate patterning of composition 
        by ear. As a leading proponent of what came to be known, somewhat problematically, 
        as “free verse,” Pound said that poetry could be divided according to 
        three essential elements: phanopoeia, melopoeia, and logopoeia – the play 
        of image, music, and meaning. In his manifestos for imagism and vorticism 
        he advanced a poetry stripped of all nonessential elements, where every 
        word makes a necessary contribution to the poem, “which  presents an intellectual 
        and emotional complex in an instant of time.&quot;</p>
      <p>Pound’s “In a Station of the Metro” (1911), exemplary of the condensation 
        and obliqueness of the imagist aesthetic,  also reflects the influence 
        of classical Chinese poetry: </p>
      <p>IN A STATION OF THE METRO </p>
      <p>     The apparition of these faces in the crowd;</p>
      <p>     Petals on a wet black bough.</p>
      <p>A second approach that Pound took to poetry, early in his career, was 
        the use of masks or personae (<i>Personae </i>is the title he gave to 
        his collection of shorter poems). Rather than the poem representing the 
        voice of the author, as in much lyric poetry, the speaker in Pound’s persona 
        poems is a made-up character with whom Pound did not completely identify. 
        This allowed Pound to be satiric, even sarcastic, not only about the subject 
        of the poems but about their speaker, although he sometimes appears to 
        share the sentiments of the poem’s persona, making for an interesting 
        ambiguity. Section II of “Hugh Selwyn Mauberly” (on the accompanying CD) 
        lampoons what “the age” (the period just before World War I) “demanded” 
        – the superficial hit of “plaster” rather than the richer pleasures of 
        “alabaster.” Section V (also on the CD) is a bitter (and anti-patriotic) 
        comment on the futility of the World War I, in which so many young men 
        died for a “botched civilization.”</p>
      <p>“Cantico del Sole” (also on the CD) is a particularly funny example of 
        Pound’s critique of the contemporary American culture’s rejection of art. 
        The poem is based on a judge’s ruling that obscenity is okay in the classics 
        because the audience for the classics is so small. In his poem, Pound 
        mockingly repeats a sentiment that might be said by the advocates of censorship, 
        but he substitutes “classics” for “pornography”: “The thought of what 
        America would be like / If the Classics had a wide circulation / Troubles 
        my sleep.” Hearing Pound draw out “America” and “wide circulation” adds 
        a strikingly perfomative element to his send-up.</p>
      <p>The third, and most important, approach Pound took to poetic composition 
        is reflected in his “epic” poem <i>The Cantos</i>, a series of long poems 
        on which he worked from his mid-thirties until the end of his life. Pound 
        defined an epic as a “poem including history.” By calling his poem an 
        “epic,” Pound brought to mind such works as Homer’s<i> Odyssey</i>, Dante’s 
        <i>Divine Comedy</i>, and Virgil’s <i>Aenead</i>. Unlike these narrative 
        poems, however, <i>The Cantos</i> uses collage or what now might be called 
        “sampling” – the  juxtaposition of quotations from a carefully selected 
        range of Eastern and Western cultures, including a fair amount of American 
        history and current events.  Quoted material forms only a small part of 
        the overall text, however, since the entire poem is shot through with 
        Pound’s own interventions, interpolations, and compositional extensions. 
        Pound’s quotations were often in Chinese, Italian, French and other languages 
        and he usually left them untranslated.  This was because Pound was interested 
        in an opaque texture for the poem; he once commented that if you didn’t 
        understand something you should just push on. In the later <i>Cantos</i>, 
        Pound organized the words spatially on the page, decisively breaking with 
        the flush left orientation of much Western poetry up until that time, 
        though following the lead of Stephane Mallarmé’s <i>Un Coup de Dés</i>. 
        The result is a poem of immense sweep, often gorgeous lyricism, with a 
        sometimes baffling range of references and many infuriatingly didactic 
        passages. For this poetry of ideas, Pound maximized discontinuity, what 
        some would call fragmentation. At the same time, he tried to maintain 
        strong authorial control over the intended meaning to be derived from 
        the juxtaposition of what he called “luminous details.”</p>
      <p>Over the course of <i>The Cantos</i>, and in his essays, Pound became  
        increasingly obsessed with economics and, in particular, his belief that 
        charging interest on money lent – in other words, the whole system of 
        monetary credit – was destroying Western civilization. In Canto XLV (on 
        the CD), he attacks “usury” – lending money at exorbitant interest rates, 
        which for Pound was any interest rate. Pound believed interest eroded 
        the rock-solid value of things. </p>
      <p>Pound’s economic views became increasing rabid over time. He associated 
        Jews with money lending and usury (a common stereotype with genocidal 
        implications), insisting that Jews, not being grounded in the land they 
        own, contributed to a waste land of modern fragmentation (an unintentionally 
        ironic view for one of the greatest progenitors of modernist fragmentation 
        in poetry and one who lived most of life in exile). In World War II, while 
        living in Italy, Pound sided with the fascist cause, writing poems and 
        speeches extolling Mussolini and excoriating Roosevelt.</p>
      <p>Pound’s troubling politics are interwoven, throughout his work, with 
        his poetics and aesthetics, making for a useful, albeit sometimes distasteful, 
        study of the unavoidable relation of poetry to politics. Pound’s work 
        reflects, like much of the century in which he wrote, both the best and 
        worst of Western civilization.</p>
