A specter is haunting the literary academy: the growing
discrepancy between our most advanced theories and institutionally
encoded proscriptions on our writing and teaching practices. </font>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">I diagnose the problem as &quot;frame lock&quot;,
a kind of logorrheic lock jaw, or sandy mouth, or bullet-with-the-baby-not-just-quite-then-almost-out-of-reach,
as a mood swinging under a noose of monomaniacal monotones, the
converted preaching to the incontrovertible, the guard rail replacing
the banisters, stairs, stories, elevation, detonation, reverberation,
indecision, concomitant intensification system. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Frame lock, and its cousin tone jam, are the prevailing
stylistic constraints of the sanctioned prose of the profession.
No matter that the content of an essay may interrogate the constructed
unity of a literary work or a putative period; may dwell on linguistic
fragmentation, demolition, contradiction, contestation, inter-eruption;
may decry assumptions of totality, continuity, narrative progression,
teleology, or truth and may insist that meaning is plural, polygamous,
profligate, uncontainable, rhetorical, slippery or sliding or
gliding or giddy and prurient. The keepers of the scholarly flame,
a touch passed hand to hand and fist to mouth by generations of
professional standard bearers and girdle makers, search committees
and admissions officers, editors and publishers, maintain, against
all comers, that the argument for this or that or the other must
maintain appropriate scholarly decorum.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Theory enacted into writing practice is suspect,
demeaned as unprofessional. But that is because theory so enacted
ceases to be theory - a body of doctrine - insofar as it threatens
with poetry or philosophy. Theory, prophylacticly wrapped in normalizing
prose styles, is protected from the scourge of writing and thinking
as active, open-ended, and investigatory. The repression of writing
styles in the literary academy is enforced by the collusion of
scholars, theorists, administrators and editors across the spectrum
of periods and methodologies. PMLA would prefer to publish poets
writing in the patrician rhetoric of the nineteenth century about
the exhaustion of poetry than to permit actual poetic acts to
violate its pages. While many of the most innovative of the profession's
theorists and scholars sit on the board of PMLA, the publication
persists in its systematic process of enforcing mood and style
control on all its articles and letters, as if tone or mood were
unrelated to argument and meaning. Difference and otherness: these
values ring hollow if they are not applied, also, to our own productions
and articulations. If PMLA - a no doubt easy but nonetheless representatively
obtrusive target - is strictly whitebread, the radical claims
for diversity made within its pages seem stifled or neutered.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Professionalism and career advancement are the bogeymen
of frame lock. Dissertations must not violate stylistic norms
because that might jeopardize our young scholar's future. &quot;Let
them be radical in what they say but not in how they say it.&quot;
- Such is the pragmatic, and characteristically self-fulfilling,
argument that is made. The point here, as in most initiation
rites, is to be hazed into submission, to break the spirit, and
to justify the past practice of the initiators. Professionalization
is the criterion of professional standing but not necessarily
professional values; nor are our professional writing standards
at or near the limits of coherence, perception, edification,
scholarship, communication, or meaning. Underneath the mask of
career-minded concessions to normalcy is an often repressed epistemological
positivism about the representation of ideas. While the philosophical
and linguistic justifications for such ideational mimesis - for
example the idea that a writing style can be transparent or neutral
- have been largely undermined, the practice of ideational mimesis
is largely unacknowledged and, as a result, persists unabated.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">In order to explore unsanctioned forms of scholarly
and critical writing, graduate students and new faculty need to
be protected against the arbitrary enforcement of antiquated stylistic
constraints. Yet even those in the profession who are sympathetic
to these new - and indeed not-at-all new - writing forms may believe
that one's initial professional work should be stylistically orthodox,
with innovations considered only in later work. This argument
is akin to the idea that art students should first learn anatomy
and figure drawing before they embark on more expressionist or
abstract work. As a generalization, there is no merit to this
argument (while of course specific individuals may benefit from
different experiences). Younger scholars and critics are most
likely to bring energy and enthusiasm to their writing, to open
up new paths, to push the boundaries of the possible; once channelled
into frame lock, more often than not they get stuck in its claustrophobic
confines. And young scholars who are not supported for taking
new directions often drop out, or are forced out, of the profession:
a loss of talent that our universities cannot afford. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">It is no secret that universities reward conformism
and conventionality under the name of both professionalization
and currency. We see all around us dress and decorum advisories
for job interviews such as those this week at the MLA: as if dressing
the same as every one else - any more than writing the same or
citing the same 17 major theorists or authors as everyone else
- makes you a better researcher or cultural interpreter. Indeed,
there is no evidence to show that tone-lock, any more than interview
dress codes, make better teachers, or more committed or knowledgeable
scholars; on the contrary, there is plenty of reason to believe
this sort of career-oriented behavior, exacerbated by the present
scarcity of jobs, breeds a professional cynicism that is disastrous
for the infectious enthusiasm and performative limberness that
are crucial components for teaching. The forms we enforce among
ourselves serve not the content of our work but the perpetuation
of our administrative apparatuses. <BR>

<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Frame lock is a term I base on Erving Goffman's Frame
Analysis. As applied to prose, it can generally be characterized
as an insistence on a univocal surface, minimal shifts of mood
either within paragraphs or between paragraphs, exclusion of extraneous
or contradictory material, and tone restricted to the narrow affective
envelope of sobriety, neutrality, objectivity, authoritativeness,
or deanimated abstraction. In frame-locked prose, the order of
sentences and paragraphs is hypotactic, based on a clear subordination
of elements to an overriding argument that is made in a narrative
or expository or linear fashion. In what might be called the rule
of the necessity of paraphrase, the argument must be separable
from its expression, so that a defined message can be extracted
from the text. To this end, arguments must be readily glossable
and indeed periodically reiterated self-glosses are used as markers
to enforce interpretative closure. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">With the proliferation of frames of interpretation
over the past fifteen years, a menu of methodological choices
is available to the young scholar. In a campus version of the
dating game, our initiate may attend a series of seminars, each
promising the satisfactions of its newly rejuvenated, comprehensively
restyled, and radically overhauled approach. One frame of interpretation
beckons with its production of detail and cultural difference,
another allures with its astounding solutions, while the sociality
of a third seems magnetic; in contrast, the social responsibility
of a fourth is compelling, while the ultimate sophistication of
a fifth is irresistible. Finally, uber alles, the retro chic of
rejecting any and all the new frames of interpretation is always
in style, always a good career move - and the fast track for getting
quoted in national media.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">After a period of flirtation with several of these
approaches, our neophyte (the neophyte within each of us) makes
a commitment to one primary frame. The marriage is consummated
in the act of being announced. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Of course a newly chosen frame of interpretation
may replace an older one; indeed divorce and remarriage are as
inevitable as new consumers in a market economy. Serial monogamy
is typical, as long as the series doesn't get very long; breaking
frame is suspect. For the crucial ingredient of frame lock is
consistency, sticking to one frame at a time. When flames are
jumped, the new frame must appear to replace the old, which is
best publicly stigmatized as damaged goods, so much youthful idealism
or false consciousness or lack of rigor. This is called keeping
up or advancing with the field.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">If I exaggerate, and my commitment to exaggeration
is second to none, even I was surprised to get a couple of examination
copies in the mail this past month from Bedford Books of St. Martin's
Press that seemed to parody beyond my powers the problem of rigid
segmentation of frames of interpretation. In what could easily
be called The Frame Lock Series of Target Texts, we have the complete,
authorized, unabridged version of Polish immigrant Joey-Joey-Joey
Conrad's brooding Heart of Darkness, in what might as well have
been six-point type, an almost expendable pretext to a half-dozen
large-type chapters offering a menu of interpretative modes -
reader-response, deconstructive, psychoanalytic, new historical,
historical materialist, and feminist. Each critical section starts
with a ten-page gloss of the theoretical approach, written in
clear unambiguous prose, studded with quotations from well-known
practitioners of the theory: just enough lucid explanation to
make a travesty of each of these methods, stripped as they are
of their context, necessity, and complexity. Appended to this
are ten pages applying the now-manageable theory to the pretext,
the absent center that is so aptly named Heart of Darkness in
this case. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Most scholars resist such compartmentalization,
such marriages of convenience, despite the professional pressures
that push them into them. But our profession too rarely addresses
the conflict between inquiry and job-search marketing in which
one's work is supposed to be easily summed up, definable, packaged,
polished, wrinkles and contradictions eliminated, digressions
booted. Insofar as we make hiring decisions using these criteria,
insofar as we train graduate students to conform to such market
imperatives, insofar as we present our own writing and scholarship
and evaluate each other's along these lines, then the demands
of our work - teaching, research, encouraging creativity - will
be severely compromised. Professionalization need not be antithetical
to our work as educators and writers and searchers, but in itself
professionalization offers no protection against the emptying
of those values that many of us would espouse for our work.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">*</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Goffman's analysis of frames is valuable for understanding
the institutional nature of all forms of communication. In particular,
frame analysis can help elucidate disputes over the curriculum
in terms of both interdisciplinarity and core (or required) courses.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">By their nature, frames focus attention on a particular
set of features at the same time as they divert attention from
other features that Goffman locates in the &quot;disattend track&quot;.
A traditional, or frame-locked, curriculum is designed so that
each of its elements fits within a single overall scheme. Like
the fourth wall in an old-fashioned play, the curricular frame
is neither questioned nor broken. Even as curricular content (the
canon) is challenged and reconstituted, the new material tends
to be reframed within revised disciplinary boundaries. In contrast,
anti-lock syllabi emphasize a performative and interdisciplinary
approach that may undercut the passive learning patterns that
currently cripple many of our educational efforts. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">The process of locating disattend tracks, and bringing
them to the center of attention, can be understood as not only
a primary pedagogical aim but also a central project of much modernist
and contemporary art. Within text-bound literary studies, the
disattend track may include such features as the visual representation
of the language as well as its acoustic structure. Moreover, a
work may best be discussed within a context that not only includes
its historical or ideological context, but also its interdependence
on contemporary painting, theater, or music, not to mention the
&quot;popular&quot; arts of the period. The idea that works of
literature can be studied in isolation from the other arts, a
founding idea of the discipline of English literary studies, may
simply be mistaken. Certainly, the very limited aesthetic consciousness
of college graduates would support the proposition that current
approaches are misguided. Basic remodeling is necessary.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Not only our subjects, but also our methods, need
to be addressed from an interdisciplinary perspective. In much
of the discourse coming out of English departments, the art of
writing has been relegated to the disattend track. To insist on
the art of writing is, ironically, to press the need for interdisciplinarity
within a field bisected against itself. To call for greater interaction
between literary studies and the literary arts is to call literary
studies back to itself.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">My idea of a core curriculum will seem perverse to
many advocates of both traditional and progressive approaches.
My commitment to difference is not satisfied only by differences
of &quot;subject positions&quot;. To be sure, a course of differences
must include a broad range of subject positions (including ones
not easily definable by prevailing categories) but, to avoid frame
lock, it also needs to include radical differences in forms, styles
and genres of expression and nonexpression. Insofar as narratives
of personal or group experience are given primacy over other formal
and aesthetic modalities, difference is not only enriched but
also suppressed. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">My modest proposal no doubt hopelessly complicates
an already difficult task because it places virtually no limits
on the number or types of possible works that might be studied.
I find this a more stimulating starting point than determining
a convenient frame that makes the task easier and more rationalizable.
For example, I find myself surprisingly impatient with the obviously
well-intentioned idea that an English department should require
its undergraduate majors to take survey courses that cover canonically
and historically significant (though previously underrepresented)
works of English literature, along with a companion course in
major trends in literary theory. In many such curricular proposals,
and in the related &quot;multicultural&quot; anthologies published
in recent years, the choice of literary authors is made with a
commitment to diversity in mind. In contrast, there is rarely
a similar commitment to diversity among the authors to be studied
in theoretical and methodological courses. Furthermore, the new
literature curriculums and anthologies are generally restricted
to English language works, while it is hard to imagine a comparable
anthology or core course in literary theory restricted only to
works written in English. A number of problematic assumptions
are at work here. In the first place, there is the idea that theory
is a quasi-scientific form of knowledge that is able to transcend
- largely, if not totally - its particular subject positions,
and, as a result, is not dependent for its value on the fact that
it represents a particular subject position. The corollary to
this is that literary works do have their value in representing
subject positions, and, as a result, are infinitely substitutable:
in effect literature becomes a series of possible examples, any
one of which is expendable. The problem is analogous to the disturbing
practice of universities doing all their affirmative action hiring
in the infinitely elastic or &quot;soft&quot; humanities rather
than doing such hiring equally in the &quot;uncompromisable&quot;
social and natural sciences. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">What is English? While poetry may be said to be untranslatable
in a way that philosophical works are not, philosophy also may
be untranslatable in certain ways. Or rather, some philosophy
(call it theory) and some literature (call it sociological) pose
few translation problems. In this respect, it is revealing that
some of the new anthologies that purport to represent cultural
diversity - The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women, edited
by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, and The Heath Anthology of
American Literature, edited by Paul Lauter, are the most prominent
- emphasize contemporary poetry written in a single-voice confessional
mode that already seems to have been translated into the prevailing
idiom of the anthologies themselves. This stylistic discrimination
entails the rejection of works that challenge the idea that English
is a transparent medium that can represent cultural experience
as if it were information (already had a form). The result is
that both formally innovative work and work in nonstandard forms
of English are marginalized.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">I could go on. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Can Continental philosophy be understood in the absence
of Continental literature? Or does Continental philosophy without
Continental literature equal American literary theory? </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Disciplinary boundaries serve more to cordon off
areas of knowledge than to encourage students to search through
a wide range of historical writers and thinkers and art practices.
I would like to see the direction of undergraduate English programs
in American universities move expansively toward the world rather
than more parochially toward the literature of England and its
linguistic heirs. While I suppose one could argue that people
in the U.S. might have a special reason to know about the history
and literature of the U.S. (though possibly North America would
be the better frame), I can't see giving priority to the literature
of England as opposed to the literature of the other European
countries - or indeed other places in the world. English majors
usually major in English not because of special interest in England
but because of a more general interest in literature, writing,
art, the humanities, or the history of ideas. English is the host
language of their study. It's not as if students are likely to
study Li Po or Soupault elsewhere in their studies - much less
the Popul Vuh or Sapho. And, if that's so, it's hard to see how
the line can be usefully drawn without including the &quot;other&quot;
arts, and works from cultures that do not identify their cultural
productions by proper names. Jerome Rothenberg's and Pierre Joris's
forthcoming Poems for the Millenium: The University of California
Book of Modern Poetry goes a long way toward redressing this problem.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">*</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">But I digress. I came here to talk paragraphs. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">*</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">I like the idea of a paragraph developing its own
internal logic, pushing a stretch of thought, turning around a
term, considering a particular angle on a problem.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">But it's the shift from paragraph to paragraph that
creates the momentum, with the jump varying from almost indiscernible
to a leap. My method of teaching, as much as writing, is to place
one thing side by side with another and another, so that the series
creates multiple perspectives on the issues addressed.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">But what is the conclusion? What knowledge is gained?
What has been taught or demonstrated? - Performance has no value,
no substance. You want a theater of ideas but no knowledge. -
As if the process of critical thinking needed an end to justify
it. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Then why does poetry have its music, fiction its
stories, essays their ideas? </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">*</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">- But aren't you conflating literary and academic
writing? -Possibly. Not necessarily. Not at all. Why are you bothering
me? Can't you understand what I'm saying? I don't like to be spoken
to in that manner. I think I deserve an apology, an ontology,
a spin doctor, a value-added package with no financing, a one-way
ticket to the next oceanliner, a way out of this pleated bag,
container, vehicle, conveyor, storage bin, basement franchise.  </FONT>

<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Is that any worse than the way you conflate philosophy
and what you like to call theory, or criticism and sociology,
or interpretation and psychoanalysis? And anyway what is the natural
form of scholarly writing? Where do our present standards come
from? What values do they propagate? What and who do they exclude?
What kinds of teaching and research do they foster, what discourage?  </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">If some of the more interrogatory directions in literary
studies, following almost a century of artistic practice, suggest
we need to break down the distinction between high art and the
rest of culture in order to investigate the interdependence of
all cultural production, then it should come as less a surprise
than it evidently does that the distinction between research and
the thing researched will also break down. Erosion goes in both
directions, or all three, since we don't want to forget about
Aunt Rosie and the Babysitter's Club. Signifying is as signifying
does. To assume a form of writing is to make it always and forever
a cultural artifact. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">*</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Am I just complaining about being bored by certain
prose styles, rendered without the panache needed to give them
the intensity they sometimes possess? In any case, I'm not trying
to exclude any of the styles of writing now practiced in the university,
but to ask why we limit it to that. And if that should change,
my questioning would find new targets. Questioning is its own
reward. Frame-locked prose seems to deny its questions, its contradictions,
its exhilarations, its comedy, its groping. </FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">I find it more interesting to teach a class, or write
an essay, on something I don't understand than to represent in
a class or essay that which I already seem to have understood
at some time previous.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">*</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">I do not propose alternating between two subjects
or two frames: that merely multiplies what is a problem in the
first instance. I am suggesting a potentially endless series that
does not systematically return to the point of its comparison,
a parade of blackout sketches on Freud's mystic writing pad, whose
origin is in departure, whose destination is in going on.</FONT>
<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">One thing I want to break down is the virtually Kantian
picture of the studier and the thing studied. Serial composition,
one paragraph adjacent to the next, one topic followed by another,
one perspective permuted with another, refuses the idea that the
studied and the studier are separable. Next to us is not the work
that we study, which we love so well to explain, but the work
we are. I unclothe myself in addressing a poem, and the poem returns
to show me my bearings, my comportment, and the way to read the
next poem or painting, person or situation.</FONT>

<P>
  <FONT color="#000000" face="Adobe Garamond Pro">Is criticism condemned to be 50 years behind the
