      <p align=justify><b>Geoffrey O’Brien and I had this email exchange in August 
        2000 on the occasion of the publication of the first two volumes of <i>American 
        Poetry: The Twentieth Century</i> by The Library of America. The collection 
        follows The Library of America’s previous anthology of nineteenth-century 
        American poetry. The advisory board for the anthology consists of Robert 
        Hass, John Hollander, Carolyn Kizer, Nathaniel Mackey, and Marjorie Perloff. 
        O’Brien is the editor in chief of The Library of America. --CB</b> 
      <p align=justify> 
      <p align=justify>&nbsp; 
      <p align=justify><i>CB: </i>The first two volumes of <i>American Poetry: 
        The Twentieth Century</i> are extraordinary collections of work by poets 
        born between 1838 (Henry Adams) and 1913 (May Swenson). I say extraordinary 
        not just because I like the selection in this anthology—I do—but as a 
        reaction to the remarkable range of poets presented. You have included 
        poets who are in most other anthologies but also a striking number who 
        are almost never seen in contemporary anthologies of American poetry. 
        You include the popular and the radically innovative, the light and the 
        heavy, poets well regarded in their time but less so in ours, and poets 
        virtually unknown in their own time whose reputation seems to be on the 
        upswing in our own. And there is an exemplary sampling of popular song 
        lyrics, from Cole Porter to Robert <b>[End Page 1]</b> Johnson. In short, 
        you have produced a historical or period anthology that does not claim 
        to include only the “best”—by anyone’s lights—but includes poems that 
        reflect the many directions poetry took during the first half of the twentieth 
        century. I would differentiate this approach from a pluralist anthology, 
        in which editors with different tastes pick their favorite poems. It’s 
        my sense that some of the poems in this collection were selected not as 
        favorites at all but for other reasons. Can you describe your sense of 
        these “other” reasons? What are the precedents for this kind of anthology, 
        both in terms of other historical anthologies of poetry and also other 
        anthologies of this period? 
      <p align=justify><i>GO’B</i>: It would be easy enough to say that the anthology’s 
        goals are historical—to give a comprehensive survey of styles, themes, 
        social tendencies, et cetera—but clearly such an approach might have yielded 
        an altogether different anthology. In fact, the inclusion of topical poems—such 
        as Sarah Cleghorn’s quatrain on child labor, the World War I poems by 
        Edmund Wilson, Robert Hillyer, and John Peale Bishop, or Witter Bynner’s 
        poem on racial discrimination in the U.S. Army during World War II—was 
        a distinct but relatively minor aspect of the editing. Thousands of such 
        poems exist and could fill many carefully calibrated collections. You 
        could do a whole volume on Sacco and Vanzetti. Likewise with form: We 
        were happy to find sestinas or haiku or epigrams that worked, but that 
        also was not a primary guideline. One reader of the anthology said it 
        could be read as a kind of novel, and that’s closer to the mark. At a 
        certain point, the anthology acquired its own imperatives as a book, and 
        the poems that got in were those that seemed to supply some element—a 
        phrase, a place, a texture, a point of view, a cadence, a design pattern, 
        a character—that deepened the effect of the whole, that defined some accent 
        or trait not otherwise evident. When I say “imperatives,” I don’t mean 
        a set of preexisting guidelines but something more like the shifting requirements 
        of a field of action, or a game of go; one poem would, as it were, elicit 
        another poem in response; poems come upon by accident would seem to force 
        their way into the book and thereby change its boundaries however slightly. 
        It was a question of focusing intently on what each possible poem, or 
        possible poet, would do to the overall effect. It became a kind of “Book 
        of the World” created collectively. 
      <p align=justify>There was a working assumption that minor poets do things 
        that aren’t duplicated by major poets, and that each poem included would 
        earn its place by striking a note or evoking an attitude not replicated 
        elsewhere. Oddness and eccentricity were particularly welcome, and this 
        was a period <b>[End Page 2]</b> of American poetry very rich in strangeness; 
        the dutifully bland, even if well crafted, was as much as possible phased 
        out. In other words, we weren’t interested in giving a guided tour of 
        outmoded tastes, or in providing examples of kinds of badness, although 
        obviously any reader is likely to find a certain portion of the work unpalatable. 
        It’s almost impossible to imagine someone liking every poem in the book, 
        although I must say that years of immersion have made me fonder than I 
        could have believed of some admittedly very minor poets. 
      <p align=justify><i>CB</i>: I appreciate your increasing affection for the 
        minor. One of the remarkable facets of this period is the reversal of 
        fortune for many poetic forms and styles: Some considered marginal and 
        eccentric not only in their time but until relatively recently now seem 
        the most influential, while lots of the presumed majors now look more 
        like held-over corporals from the previous epoch. Not that there wouldn’t 
        be a lot of people who would give me an argument on any specifics I would 
        care to name. The LOA [Library of America] anthology doesn’t abolish the 
        categories of major and minor, at least if widely discrepant page counts 
        are taken as the guide. Seventy-three pages of Wallace Stevens are bordered 
        by twenty pages of Vachel Lindsay and three pages of Angelina Weld Grimké 
        [the book is ordered by poets’ birthdates]. I understand what you are 
        saying about not being simply historical, indiscriminately historical: 
        It is clear that this book is assembled for reading and not just to create 
        a representative record. But any good historian or editor makes precisely 
        these kinds of judgments. I would say that you have picked exemplary works, 
        but that only begs the question of what counts as exemplary: What, in 
        the year 2000, seems interesting, relevant, informative, unexpected? In 
        some sense, what remains alive? Along the way, I do think you are undermining 
        the major/minor distinction, because if I read this anthology as a book, 
        as you suggest, then the players with the smaller parts are indispensable. 
        The whole has an ensemble feeling, rather than a set of star turns or 
        continuous highlights. It insists that poetry is for reading, and if all 
        you want to do is skip to the so-called good parts, you are missing the 
        story. This, in turn, strikes a blow against a still prevalent reading 
        value for poetry—that the only thing that really matters is masterpieces, 
        those precious few. To read poetry filtered in that way is to take it 
        out of the social field, to deanimate it. It takes away from Stevens as 
        much as from poets overlooked. The spirit of poetry, not to say what matters 
        about poetry, can be experienced only if one reads around in it, checking 
        out not only the different types of work but also both the different orders 
        of success <b>[End Page 3]</b> and the different measures of success. 
        And this is not only because readers will disagree about what is the best, 
        accusing each other of perpetrating minors as majors, so that one never 
        will really be able to come out with consensus on just exactly who those 
        elect might be. The problem is with the idea of the “few” itself: Poetry 
        is a social field whose meaning comes, in part, from the relationship 
        among poems. To remove that social field is to strip poems of the cultural 
        context that lends them meaning. In contrast, the pluralism of many anthologies 
        just takes designated domains and presents the “best of” each: It actually 
        compounds the problem with the major/minor distinction. Another way of 
        saying this is that an anthology such as this one from LOA helps to reclaim 
        Stevens as minor, returning him to poetry again. Yet it can accomplish 
        this only by the very precise selection not only of Stevens’s poems but 
        also of the poems surrounding them. This process requires rather more 
        editorial intervention than the more typical “greatest hits” approach, 
        which often, just because of its lofty criteria, ends up coming up short. 
        If anthologies are something of a shell game, the point is not just to 
        uncover the peas but to present the shells as well, otherwise you may 
        find that the dish ran away with the spoon. 
      <p align=justify>All this reminds me of a story. A couple of critics were 
        speaking of their ideal anthology. The first critic compared two anthologies. 
        The first anthology was described as containing only the most perfect 
        works, sublime content married to consummate craft. The other anthology 
        was described as a ragtag and noisy affair of the good, the bad, and the 
        promising, the overstated or too ambitious, the utterly discountable and 
        the at-best-okay. Finally, the second critic got up to speak and said 
        that he agreed completely with the first critic: The two anthologies were 
        accurately described. The one anthology was indeed very crowded and boisterous, 
        and, no question, the other was pristine and solitary, unmarred by imperfection. 
        The only problem was that it was blank: there wasn’t a single poem in 
        it. 
      <p align=justify>Something of this is suggested by Grimké’s poem “Dawn”: 
      <blockquote> Grey trees, grey skies, and not a star; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey mist, grey hush; <br>
        And then, frail, exquisite, afar <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hermit-thrush.</blockquote>
      <p align=justify>In the anthology, this poem immediately follows Stevens’s 
        “Of Mere Being”—the poem that famously begins with “The palm at the end 
        of the mind.” And it’s as if the two poems are in conversation, as if 
        the whole book is in wild Bakhtinian dialogue (to turn Bakhtin on his 
        head): <b>[End Page 4]</b> 
      <blockquote> . . . A gold feathered bird <br>
        Sings in the palm, without human meaning, <br>
        Without human feeling, a foreign song. 
        <p align=justify>You know then that it is not the reason <br>
          That makes us happy or unhappy. <br>
          The bird sings. Its feathers shine. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align=justify><i>GO’B</i>: The idea of dialogue, of poets listening to 
        and responding to other poets, is pretty basic here. Sometimes explicitly—Hyam 
        Plutzik writing an open letter to T. S. Eliot about anti-Semitism (“Come 
        let us weep together for our exile”), or Carl Sandburg paying tribute 
        to Adelaide Crapsey upon her untimely death, or Max Eastman getting mad 
        at Genevieve Taggard, or Genevieve Taggard making a city map out of poetry 
        (“Myself, I’m living now on Fearing Sq. . . . I hear the rents are unusually 
        high out in the Tate section”), or Wilson savaging Archibald MacLeish 
        in his parody “The Omelet of A. MacLeish,” or Lindley Williams Hubbell 
        free-associating about forgotten poets (“and there was Mina Loy, whom 
        Ezra Pound / considered quite as good a poet as Marianne Moore, / now 
        quite forgotten [she might make a comeback, though]”). Then there are 
        the shadow-poets who were read, absorbed, and forgotten—Donald Evans, 
        whom Stevens knew and read, and whose “En Monocle” may have filtered into 
        “Le Monocle de Mon Oncle,” or Alfred Kreymborg, who at one point was regarded 
        by many as pretty much indistinguishable from William Carlos Williams: 
      <blockquote> To have reached <br>
        the ultimate top <br>
        of the stalk, <br>
        single and tall; <br>
        to hang like a bell <br>
        through sheer weight <br>
        of oneself; <br>
        to have six petals . . .</blockquote>
      <p align=justify>At some point in the thirties, you can <i>hear</i> Elizabethan 
        and Jacobean poetry being bodily lifted into American poetry (out of Eliot 
        and Hart Crane via James Agee, Louise Bogan, Yvor Winters, Delmore Schwartz). 
        Or you can trace a particularly stark and unadorned American iambic coming 
        down the pike from Edwin Arlington Robinson (“Here was the room again 
        where he had been”) through Frost (“The shattered water made a misty din”) 
        to Elizabeth Bishop (“The pigs stuck out their little feet and snored”). 
        Again, the <b>[End Page 5]</b> Whitmanic echo reverberating through folks 
        like Charles Erskine Scott Wood and Arturo Giovannitti and, more harshly 
        and pointedly, Robinson Jeffers. Jack Spicer’s words have been a kind 
        of motto for this project: “Poems should echo and reecho against each 
        other. . . . They cannot live alone any more than we can.” 
      <p align=justify>Which is not in any way to detract from the singularity 
        of the individual poem or poet. Quite the contrary: The specificities 
        stand out all the more strikingly when the poets are allowed to bounce 
        off each other. The reverberations go on forever, and in a sense such 
        an anthology could be infinitely long. If it isn’t, it’s because not too 
        many people could stand it. The length is not a cutoff, a way of saying 
        that there isn’t any more there, but a concession to the limits of attentiveness. 
        Because the more one reads, the more does keep emerging, as for instance 
        in the single poem by Skipwith Cannell that found its way (at the eleventh 
        hour, I might add) into the book, where I now cast my eye and find: 
      <blockquote> There is no land and the sea <br>
        Is black like cypresses waiting at midnight <br>
        In a place of tombs</blockquote>
      <p align=justify>A perfect stanza for the great unending imagist poem that 
        American poets have been working on since Whitman, I guess. There are 
        also those many premonitory echoes of the future, of the poetry of the 
        fifties and sixties, and of the twenty-first century, being written in 
        1920 or 1936. “The knave of diamonds, in his darkened room, / Holds in 
        his hands a key,” sang Bob Dylan to Conrad Aiken. All this leaves unanswered 
        the major/minor question, but in many ways it seems a false question. 
        The major poets were those whom everyone involved in putting these books 
        together felt to be so. On closer examination, they were those whose work 
        was profuse and profusely interesting; they gave the impression of imposing 
        their presence, of not submitting to be cut back. (I would apply this 
        also to a poet such as Lindsay, who demands a certain amount of room and 
        does not thrive with less. Charles Olson undoubtedly wanted more room 
        than we could give him; that was a tussle.) 
      <p align=justify><i>CB</i>: There’s no question that the reading of twentieth-century 
        poetry suffers under the idea that it is a lonely art of self-contained 
        works; the writers have known all along that that isn’t so, and readers 
        are always finding out. Those who dislike anthologies, whether period 
        anthologies like yours, or more aesthetically directed ones like Jerome 
        Rothenberg’s, may miss that fact. <b>[End Page 6]</b> (The companion anthologies 
        to yours, which I would recommend, would be <i>Poems for the Millennium</i>, 
        volume 1, edited by Rothenberg and Pierre Joris, and <i>Revolution of 
        the Word</i>, edited by Rothenberg.) As to Olson, don’t you know that 
        lack of anthology <i>space</i> is the central fact for poets born in America! 
        Olson’s thirty-one pages in volume 2 can’t really begin to give the sweep 
        of <i>Maximus</i>, which represents a third of the selection, while Elizabeth 
        Bishop’s thirty-one pages, neighboring Olson, as she is just one year 
        his junior, probably represent her poetry better. That’s inevitable, given 
        the differing nature of the work. Still, there is a delicious justice—after 
        years of comparative neglect—in having all of George Oppen’s “Discrete 
        Series” and Louis Zukofsky’s “Poem Beginning ‘The,’” the first major works 
        of each, even if readers will have to get their books to see the full 
        extent of the later work. Similarly, Lorine Niedecker and Sterling Brown 
        may have only nineteen pages each, but their work glimmers here, while 
        Melvin Tolson’s thirteen pages send you in the right direction. And while 
        Abraham Lincoln Gillespie and John Cage have only three pages each, those 
        pages are explosive enough to open up whole new textual possibilities. 
        And then there is only one page given to Eugene Jolas, but what a page: 
        It’s an American response to Hugo Ball, and it rocks: “illa mala rulidala 
        / singa rusta prilanala / buina ruli astara.” But I don’t want to get 
        into the counting game or even to naming my favorite game, or I want to 
        but I object to the reflex reaction. Still, it’s worth noting that volume 
        2, which begins with e. e. cummings, born in 1894, has a strong representation 
        of some of my favorite “sometimes overlooked” poets. Indeed, this second 
        volume is filled with more nooks and crannies than you find in Central 
        Park; of the two volumes, I think it’s the most intriguing and surprising, 
        since the great triumph of eccentricity among these second-wave modernists 
        has for too long been overshadowed by their immediate predecessors. And 
        I was delighted that you included one of my favorite Ogden Nash poems, 
        his great but unrecognized manifesto against metaphoric language and for 
        linguistic materiality, “Very Like a Whale,” which very nearly ends, “The 
        snow is a white blanket. Oh it is, is it, all right then, you sleep under 
        a half-inch blanket of unpoetical blanket material and we’ll see which 
        one keeps warm.” 
      <p align=justify><i>GO’B</i>: The naming of favorites, or of favorite conjunctions, 
        is hard to resist. I love the way two relatively obscure contemplatives, 
        Robert Francis and Lindley Williams Hubbell, brush up against each other 
        with meditations-on-the-edge-of-extinction like “Museum Vase” (Francis) 
        and “Waka” (Hubbell). The second volume, as you note, was by far the greater 
        stimulus, since so <b>[End Page 7]</b> many of these poets have not been 
        anthologized extensively. I hope, for example, that the scope of Yvor 
        Winters’s work, which has been presented selectively or, increasingly, 
        not at all, will be more apparent with more of the early imagist poems 
        in place. David Schubert is another poet who has been mostly—or perhaps 
        entirely—skipped over by anthologists; as Ashbery and others have said 
        for years, he’s distinctly a harbinger of the tone associated with the 
        New York Poets. Mary Barnard—a living poet writing very much in the tradition 
        of Pound and H.D.—likewise has been ignored. I would hope that all these 
        juxtapositions of things that are often kept apart and sometimes not included 
        at all might have a kind of irrigating influence. The cadences and images 
        do begin to reflect each other in unexpected ways, as, for example, glancing 
        across the page from Lightnin’ Hopkins to May Sarton, her “With solitude 
        for my domain” suddenly sounds like a blues line. Such happy accidents 
        and seemingly random connections can be as fruitful as finding what was 
        consciously intended, either by the poets or, for that matter, the anthologists. 
        Each reader, each reading, makes new maps. 
      <p align=justify>I should note, by way of concluding, that these volumes 
        have been extremely successful and have already gone into second printings. 
        The purpose of The Library of America is not only to publish but to get 
        the books into people’s hands on as wide a scale as possible, and in this 
        case that purpose has been met in gratifying fashion. I hope that it won’t 
        be too long before we’ll be able to add a third volume to this ongoing 
        project, a volume that would extend into the 1950s and 1960s and beyond. 
        Of course, such a volume would require a more rigorous culling, given 
        the expanded number of poets who would likely be under consideration. 
        But it would be exciting to extend the approach of these volumes into 
        more recent decades, leaving only our contemporaries and juniors to be 
        dealt with in yet a fourth volume. In the meantime, it would be nice if 
        these two volumes spark some further exploration and excavation of these 
        poets, so much of whose work remains out of print. The period was too 
        rich to be represented by a score of individuals.
