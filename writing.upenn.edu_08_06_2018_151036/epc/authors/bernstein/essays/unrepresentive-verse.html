The organizers of this panel have asked us to consider two famous
passages, one from Auden and the other from Adorno, that speak of the
political fate of poetry. Rogélio Lopez Cuenca contexutalizes the first
in one of his marvelous detoured signs: "DU CALME: Poetry Makes Nothing
Happen." <i>Relax </i>and so we shall -- But let me take this in a different direction before coming back to Adorno.
</strong></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>A hundred years ago Oscar Wilde 
        - a writer perhaps even more celebrated in Victorian England than Allen 
        Ginsberg in postwar America - was hounded to death while at the very height 
        of his fame and at the top of his magnificent form. Allen Ginsberg, and 
        to be sure many others, courageously refused to be bashed down by the 
        perverts who would end a person's life and career because of their sexual 
        orientation or lifestyle. He was part of a massive cultural movement to 
        make what happened to Wilde if not unthinkable at least unacceptable in 
        the U. S. of A. He did this not by presenting "positive" images of being 
        gay or smoking pot but by presenting by turns joyous and defiant images 
        of these things and a number of others. Wilde ends his days in jail and 
        then disgrace. Ginsberg is celebrated - on the occasion of his death two 
        weeks ago - even in the pages that reviled him - the <i>Times</i>, the 
        <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>&amp;</i>c - I say this not because it is not well 
        known to the people at this conference but because it suggests an idea 
        of the poet that Ginsberg so magnificently embodied - it is that idea 
        of the public poet that this panel has been asked to address.</strong></font></p>
      <p>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><strong> Allen Ginsberg is one of the few
poets of the postwar period to cross over both into popular and mass
culture &amp; this is primarily because he remained (among other
things) a poet of and for adolescent identification, right up to the
end of his life. By adolescence I mean the defiance of authority and a
sexual omnivorousness, combined with a bad boy image in which the poet
wears his, in this case considerable, learning as lightly as possible.
It was Ginsberg's genius to synthesize political and social dissent
into something intensely appealing to adolescents &#352; of all ages. But if
Ginsberg had astounding success at attracting media attention, this was
not because he took stands in an effort to gain public exposure; his
success in this realm is largely dependent on the authenticity of his
way of life as much as his positions, a mode of authenticity that he
takes, above all, from Whitman. Yet the twentieth century poet he ends
up most resembling is not Bill Williams of Patterson but Tommy Eliot of
St. Louis. Resembles, but only in the sense of a reverse or polorized
image: for Eliot became the poet as symbol of the closed, the
repressed, the xenophobic, the authoritative; in short, of high culture
in the worst sense; while Ginsberg became the symbol of the open, the
uncloseted, the anti-authoritarian; indeed, of low culture in the best
sense. Ginsberg's moves from ethnically particularized Jewishness (Al
from Jersey) to small b buddhism (bubba to Baba) is correlative to
Eliot's move from Christian-American to High Church Anglican - in both
cases an assumption of a new religion as vehicle for universal
identification that gets you high or anyway higher. Ginsberg, after
all, is an anarchist in politics, a libertine in lifestyle, a buddhist
in religion - the virtual inverse of Eliot's monarchist in politics,
uptight in lifestyle, Anglican in religion. Yet if Ginsberg's
adolescent sublime provided a role for the poet that was hugely
desirable in mass and popular culture, this was often at visible, if
not actual, expense of his poetry, consummately sophisticated political
acumen, and ethical grounding, none of which, on their own, could have
gained him access to the public space he occupied for near to 40 years.
Indeed his poetry was obscured by his public stature while that stature
provided an important, and relatively rare, platform for an admirable
form of liberationist politics. The dynamic is not unrelated to the
case of Eliot, for insofar as he became as symbol of poetry as the
antithesis of adolescence, the greatest achievements of his own poems
were also obscured; indeed, this is the central obscurity of Eliot's
poetry, not the textual difficulty that has been fodder for popular
accounts for so many years. (And after all "Prufrock" is also a great
work of the adolescent sublime.)</strong></font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>As a result of all this, Ginsberg's
legacy for poetry, just as Eliot's, is not an entirely happy one, which
I say without intending any negative judgment on each of their often
astoundingly great poems. Much of the poetry that shares a social and
formal affinity with Ginsberg has assiduously avoided just the forms of
grand address and narrow historical self-identification that projected
his poetry so decisively into a public space achieved by few of his
contemporaries or heirs. For it has seemed a greater urgency for poetry
to find means of articulation in which the poetic project itself - the
details of particular sounds in particular orders - is not subsumed by
a cultural project that is in many ways antipathetic to poetry; that
is, if poetry is understood not as an idea but a practice, and not a
matter of comrades-through-time or cultural positions, but of words and
syntax. The cultural project of this poetry of radically small scale is
- and this is surely Adorno's point -
to refuse such absorption by mass culture, so as to keep the
attentional focus on the possibilities of language, on what language
has to tell. Not only to sing of felicities and dance with facility but
trip and fall the better to make music of our flailing and of our
incapacities. And, yes, of course, that is also what Ginsberg, in <i>Howl,</i> in <i>Kaddish,</i> and indeed also Eliot, in <i>The Waste Land,</i> in <i>Prufrock</i>
may be said to be doing. So today I call them back from the nether
world of cultural representatives to the practice, their practice,
still largely obscured, of the writing and performance of poems in a
word that, as Jack Spicer put it, "no one / listens to poetry" but
which, from time to time, may heed the voice of the poet.

<font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>As I said at the outset, the
organizers of this panel have asked us to consider not only the
quotation from Auden ("Poetry makes nothing happen") but also one from
Theador Adorno, which they have slightly elided. </strong></font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><strong> In his 1949 essay "Cultural
Criticism and Society", Adorno wrote, "Cultural criticism finds itself
faced with the final stage of the dialectic of culture and barbarism.
To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. And this corrodes even the
knowledge of why it has become impossible to write poetry today.
Absolute reification, which presupposed intellectual progress as one of
its elements, is now preparing to absorb the mind entirely." [ -
Theodor W. Adorno, <i>Prisms,</i> tr. Samuel and Shierry Weber (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1981), p. 34.]</strong></font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>But it might be even more telling
to say that, after Auchwitz, it is not only the individual voice of
lyric poetry but also the ventriloquised voice of public discourse (in
poetry and the massed media) that flirts with barbarism by reifying
individuality and publicity, as if they were the same thing, in the
quenchless desire for absorption by the Culture-at-Large.</strong></font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Yet poetry, representative of the problem, may also provide unrepresentated alternatives.
As Little Orphan Anagram says, "Poetry fakes nothing actually."
But this is a poetry that we must continually reinvent and which must reinvent us.
