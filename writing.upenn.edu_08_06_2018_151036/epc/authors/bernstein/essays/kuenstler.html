           <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here's what I wrote for <i>13 1/2 Poems</i>: <br>
              <br>
              The publication 
              of <i>13 1/2 Poems</i> marks the twentieth anniversary of Film Culture's 
                  edition of Frank Kuenster's first book <i>Lens</i>. <i>Lens's</i> brilliantly iconoclastic and cosmic compression of syntax and lexicon 
                  ranks Kuenstler with such pioneers of Zaum (Khlebnikov's word for 
                  pervasively neologistic poetry) as Gillespie, Melnick, and Inman. 
                  In 13 1/2 Poems, we get another side of Kuenstler -- less intractably 
                  opaque, more lightheartedly amusing. Each of the poems in the new 
                  collection suggests a different style: Kuenstler has provided a 
                  group show all on his own. More remarkably, in the long, final poem, "Text", Kuenstler achieves a maniacally nonstop synthesis of "blunt" 
                cut-up and everyday "pandemonium" --"Foolish spirit foolish theory 
                  zeal almost macabre A craze ... alert aggressive, military Maudlin, 
                  extreme."</font>

                <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>LENS</i> remains, for 
                me, Kuenstler's great work. It is composed, basically, of two-word 
                pairs joined by a period (though a period follows every word pair 
                as well); though sometimes phrases stand in for single words. It is 
                flush right, with hyphens noting split words. It runs 92 pages and 
                is dated at the end: 1952-1964. Here is the opening of LENS (though 
              note the original is justified): </font>

              not only metaphorically but literally: I occasionally ran into him 
              in the xerox store and on the streets. For a number of years he 
              send out xeroxed pages of found art, with just an almost anonymous
