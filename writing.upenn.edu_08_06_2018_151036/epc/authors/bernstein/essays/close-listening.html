      <p>While the performance of poetry is as old as poetry itself, critical
        attention to modern and contemporary poetry performance has been negligible,
        despite the crucial importance of performance to the practice of the poetry of
        this century. The subject is wide-ranging and requires a range of approaches.
        At one end of the spectrum would be philosophical and critical approaches to
        the contribution of sound to meaning: the way poets, and especially twentieth
        century innovative poets, work with sound as material, where sound is neither
        arbitrary nor secondary but constitutive. At the other end of the spectrum
        would be critical interpretations of the performance style of individual poets.
        Such approaches may well encourage &ldquo;close listenings&rdquo; not only to the printed
        text of poems, but also to tapes and performances.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Close listenings may contradict &ldquo;readings&rdquo; of poems that are based exclusively on
        the printed text and that ignore the poet's own performances, the &ldquo;total&rdquo; sound
        of the work, and the relation of sound to semantics.&nbsp; Certainly,
        discussion of sound as a material and materializing dimension of poetry also
        calls into play such developments as sound poetry, performance poetry, radio
        plays and radio &ldquo;space,&rdquo; movie soundtracks, poetry/music collaborations, and
        other audioworks.&nbsp; Beyond that, &ldquo;close listenings&rdquo; call for a
        non-Euclidean (or complex) prosody for the many poems for which traditional
        prosody does not apply.<span style='font-family:"Times",serif'>

      <p>Since the 1950s, the poetry reading has become one of the most important
        sites for the dissemination of poetic works in North America, yet studies of
        the distinctive features of the poem-in-performance have been rare (even full-length
        studies of a poet&rsquo;s work routinely ignore the audiotext), and readings &ndash; no
        matter how well attended&nbsp; &ndash; are never reviewed by newspapers or magazines
        (though they are the frequent subject of light, generally misinformed,
  &ldquo;feature&rdquo; stories on the perennial &ldquo;revival&rdquo; of poetry).<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a

        large archive of audio and video documents, dating back to an early recording
        of Tennyson's almost inaudible voice, awaits serious study and interpretation.
        The absence of such a history has had the effect of eliding the significance of
        the modernist poetry traditions for postwar performance art. At the same time,
        the performative dimension of poetry has significant relation to text-based
        visual and conceptual art, as well as visual poetry, which extend the
        performative (and material) dimension of the literary text into visual
        space.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

</span></p>
      <p>The newly emerging field of performance studies and theory provides a useful
        context for this study.&nbsp; By considering examples of &ldquo;total&rdquo; performances
        in other cultures, performance theorists have reoriented the discussion of the
        relation of theater, audience, and text. While much of the discussion of
        postmodern performance art has been focused on this and related contexts, there
        has been considerably less focus on the implications for poetry
        performance.&nbsp; Particularly helpful for &ldquo;close listening&rdquo; <span
class=GramE>is&nbsp; Erving</span> Goffman&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Frame Analysis</i>,
        especially his conception of how the cued frame through which a situation (or
        work) is viewed necessarily puts other features out of frame, into what he
        calls the &ldquo;disattend track.&rdquo; Focusing attention on a poem&rsquo;s content or form
        typically involves putting the audiotext as well as the typography &ndash; the sound
        and look &ndash; of the poem, into the disattend track. Indeed, the drift of much
        literary criticism of the two decades has been away from the auditory and
        performative aspects of the poem, partly because of the prevalent notion that
        the sound structure of language is relatively arbitrary. Such elements as the
        visual appearance of the text or the sound of the work in performance may be
        extralexical but they are not extrasemantic. When textual elements that are
        conventionally framed out as nonsemantic are acknowledged as significant, the
        result is a proliferation of possible frames of interpretation. Then it becomes
        a question of whether we see these frames or strata as commensurate with each
        other, leading to a &ldquo;total image complex&rdquo; of the poem, to use Veronica
        Forrest-Thomson&rsquo;s term; or whether we see these strata as incommensurate with
        each other, contradictory, leading to a reading of the poem as
        untotalizable.&nbsp; Here &ldquo;strata&rdquo; might usefully be thought of also as the
        kind of layers, one finds in&nbsp;a palimpsest.&nbsp;<span style='font-family:
"Times",serif'>
  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>In a sense, the&nbsp;<i>Close Listening</i>&nbsp;collection emerged as a
        complex, multilayered response to a quite simple, and common, response to a
        poetry reading, as when one says: &ldquo;I understand the work better hearing the
        poet read it. I would never have been able to figure out that the poems would
        sound that way.&rdquo; (This is not to discount the significance of performances by
        poets that seem &ldquo;bad&rdquo; for one reason or another or may make one like the work
        less than on the page, nor to distract from the significance of the performance
        of a poem by someone other than its author.)&nbsp; Insofar as poetry
        performance is countenanced as a topic of discussion, the subject is often
        assumed to be exemplified by such high-octane examples as Vachel Lindsay's
        notorious &ldquo;Congo&rdquo; (&ldquo;MUMBO JUMBO in the CONNNG-GO&rdquo;), or Carl Sandburg's
        melodramatic presentation style (&ldquo;in the tooooombs, the coooool toooooombs&rdquo;),
        or Allen Ginsberg&rsquo;s near-chanting of &ldquo;Howl&rdquo;, or more recently the &ldquo;rap&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;slam&rdquo;, and &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; poetry.&nbsp; But the unanticipatably slow tempo of
        Wallace Stevens's performance tells us much about his sense of the poem's
        rhythms and philosophical sensuousness, just as John Ashbery's near monotone
        suggests a dreamier dimension than the text sometimes reveals.&nbsp; The
        intense emotional impact of Robert Creeley&rsquo;s pauses at line breaks gives an
        affective interpretation to what otherwise reads as a highly formal sense of
        fragmented line breaks &ndash; the breaks suggest emotional pitch and distress in a
        way audible in the recordings but not necessarily on the page.&nbsp; The
        recordings of Gertrude Stein make clear both the bell-like resonance of her
        voice and her sense of shifting rhythms against modulating repetitions and the
        shapeliness of her sound-sense; while hearing Langston Hughes one immediately
        picks up not only on the specific blues echoes in the work but how he modulated
        shifts into and out of these rhythms.&nbsp; Having heard these poets read, we
        change our hearing and reading of their works on the page as well.<span

</span></p>
      <p>No doubt, there are a number of factors that are involved in the
        dramatically increased significance of the poetry reading in the postwar period
        in North American and the United Kingdom. At the outset, though, let me put
        forward one explanation.&nbsp; During the past forty years, more and more poets
        have used forms whose sound patterns are<i>&nbsp;made up</i>&nbsp;&ndash; that is,
        their poems do not follow received or prefabricated forms. &nbsp;It is for
        these poets that the poetry reading has taken on so much significance. For the
        sound shapes of the poems of such practitioners are often most immediately and
        viscerally heard in performance (taped or live), even if the attuned reader
        might be able to hear something comparable in her or his own (prior) reading of
        the text.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The poetry reading is a public tuning.</i>&nbsp; (Think
        of how public readings in the 1950s by Creeley, Ginsberg, Olson, and Jack
        Kerouac established &ndash; in a primary way &ndash; not only the sound of their work but
        also the possibilities for related work. Bob Perelman&rsquo;s discussion of the
        poet&rsquo;s talk explores more recent versions of a practice largely established by
        these poets.)&nbsp; The proliferation of poetry readings has allowed a spinning
        out into the world of a new series of acoustic modalities, which have had an
        enormous impact <span class=GramE>in&nbsp; informing</span> the reading of
        contemporary poetry. These performances set up new conventions that are
        internalized and applied to further reading of the poetic texts. They are the
        acoustic grounding of innovative practice &ndash; our collective sounding board.<br>
  <br>
        To be heard, poetry needs to be sounded &ndash; whether in a process of active, or
        interactive, reading of a work or by the poet in performance.&nbsp; Unsounded
        poetry remains inert marks on a page, waiting to be able to be called into use
        by saying, or hearing, the words aloud.&nbsp; The poetry reading provides a
        focal point for this process in that its existence is uniquely tied to the
        reading aloud of the text; it is an emblem <span class=GramE>of&nbsp; the</span> necessity for such reading out loud and in public. Nor is the process of
        transforming soundless words on a page into performed language unique to the
        poetry reading.&nbsp; To give just one example, Jerome Rothenberg points to the
        ancient Jewish tradition of reading and incanting the Torah &ndash; turning a script
        without vowels into a fully voiced sounding.<a name="_ftnref3"></a><a
href="close-listening.html#_ftn3"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref3'>&nbsp;[2]&nbsp;</span><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref3'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref3'></span>Public
        recitation also brings to mind a number of sermonic traditions, from subdued preachment
        to Gospel call-and-response. And if the poetry reading provides unscripted
        elements for the performer, it also provides special possibilities for the
        listener, from direct response to the work, ranging from laughter to derision;
        to the pleasure of getting lost in language that surges forward, allowing the
        mind to wander in the presence of words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        When the audiotape archive of a poet's performance is acknowledged as a
        significant, rather than incidental, part of her or his work, a number of important
        textual and critical issues emerge. What is the status of discrepancies among
        performed and published versions of poems, and, moreover, between
        interpretations based on the text versus interpretations based on the
        performance? Amiri Baraka is one of the most dynamic poetry performers of the
        postwar period. For Baraka, making the words dance in performance means taking
        the poems off the page, out of the realm of ideas, and into action. In some of
        Baraka&rsquo;s most vibrantly performed poems, such as &ldquo;Afro-American Lyric,&rdquo; the
        text can seem secondary, as if, as William Harris seems to suggest in his
        discussion of the poem, the text &ndash; with its inventive typography &ndash; has become
        merely a score for the performance.<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn4"><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref4'>[3]&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref4'></span></a><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref4'></span>Surely, it is always possible for some
        poems to seem thinner on the page than in performance,&nbsp;<i>and vice versa</i>.&nbsp;
        But I don&rsquo;t think this is the case for Baraka, whose work is always exploring
        the dialectic of performance and text, theory and practice, the literary and
        the oral &ndash; a dialectic that will involve clashes more than harmony.
        Performance, in the sense of doing, is an underlying formal aesthetic as much
        as it is a political issue in Baraka&rsquo;s work.<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a
href="close-listening.html#_ftn5"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref5'>&nbsp;[4]&nbsp;</span><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref5'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref5'></span>&nbsp;
        The shape of his performances <span class=GramE>are</span> iconic &ndash; they
        signify.&nbsp; In this <span class=GramE>sense</span> the printed text of
  &ldquo;Afro-American Lyric&rdquo; works to spur the (silent, atomized) reader&nbsp;<i>into&nbsp;</i>performance
  &ndash; it insists on action; the page&rsquo;s apparent textual &ldquo;lack&rdquo; is the motor of its
        form.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
style='font-family:"Times",serif'>
  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>The text of &ldquo;Afro-American Lyric&rdquo; brings to mind the language of Marxist
        political pamphlets, foregrounding the poem&rsquo;s untransformed didacticism.&nbsp;
        Hearing Baraka read this poem on a tape of his July 26, 1978 performance at the
        Naropa Institute, however, gives a distinctly different impression. Baraka
        sounds the syllables of &ldquo;simple shit&rdquo; (&ldquo;Seeeeeeeeeee-immmmmmmmmmm pull&rdquo; in the
        text), interweaving and syncopating them with &ldquo;exploiting class, owning class,
        bourgeois class, reactionary class,&rdquo; turning the text&rsquo;s diatribe into a cross
        between a sound poem and a scat jazz improvisation.&nbsp; He makes playful yet
        dissonant music from the apparently refractory words of Marxist analysis,
        bringing out the uncontained phonic plenitude inside and between the words.
        This is no mere embellishment of the poem but a restaging of its meaning
        (&ldquo;Class Struggle in Music&rdquo;, as Baraka titles a later poem).&nbsp; Baraka's
        recitations invoke a range of performance rhetorics from hortatory to
        accusatory: typically, he will segue from his own intoning of a song tune to a
        more neutrally inflected phrase, then plunge into a percussively grating sound.<span
style='font-family:"Times",serif'>
  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>What&rsquo;s the relation of Baraka&rsquo;s performance &ndash; or of any poem performed by
        its author &ndash; to the original text?&nbsp; I want to overthrow the common
        presumption that the text of a poem &ndash; that is, the written document &ndash; is
        primary and that the recitation or performance of a poem by the poet is
        secondary and fundamentally inconsequential to the &ldquo;poem itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
        conventional view, recitation has something of the status of interpretation &ndash;
        it provides a possible gloss of the immutable original. One problem with this
        perspective, most persuasively argued by Jerome McGann in&nbsp;<i>Black Riders,
          The Textual Condition,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism</i>,
        is that there is often no one original written version of a poem. Even leaving
        aside the status of the manuscript, there often exist various and discrepant
        printings &ndash; I should like to say textual performances &ndash; in magazines and books,
        with changes in wording but also spacing, font, paper and, moreover, contexts
        of readership; making for a plurality of versions none of which can claim sole
        authority. I would call these multifoliate versions&nbsp;<i>performances</i>&nbsp;of
        the poem; and I would add the poet&rsquo;s own performance of the work in a poetry
        reading, or readings, to the list of variants that together, plurally,
        constitute and reconstitute the work. This, then, is clearly not to say that
        all performances of a poem have equal authority. An actor&rsquo;s rendition, like a
        type designer&rsquo;s &ldquo;original&rdquo; setting of a classic, will not have the same kind of
        authority as a poet&rsquo;s own reading or the first printing of the work. But the
        performance of the poet, just as the visualization of the poem in its initial
        printings, forever marks the poem&rsquo;s entry into the world; and not only its
        meaning, its existence.<span style='font-family:"Times",serif'>
  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>A poem understood as a performative event and
        not merely as a textual entity refuses the originality of the written document
        in favor of &ldquo;the plural event&rdquo; of the work, to use a phrase of Andrew
        Benjamin&rsquo;s. That is, the work is not identical to any one graphical or
        performative realization of it, nor can it be equated with a totalized unity of
        these versions or manifestations.&nbsp; The poem, viewed in terms of its
        multiple performances, or mutual intertranslatability, has a fundamentally
        plural existence.&nbsp; This is most dramatically enunciated when instances of
        the work are contradictory or incommensurable, but it is also the case when
        versions are commensurate. To speak of the poem in performance is, then, to
        overthrow the idea of the poem as a fixed, stable, finite linguistic object; it
        is to deny the poem its self-presence and its unity.&nbsp; Thus, while
        performance emphasizes the material presence of the poem, and of the performer,
        it at the same time denies the unitary presence of the poem, which is to say
        its metaphysical unity.<br>
  <br>
        Indulge me now as I translate some remarks by Benjamin on psychoanalysis and
        translation into the topic at hand:<span style='font-family:"Times",serif'>
  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>The question of presence, the plurality within being present, is of
        fundamental significance for poetry. The presence of the text (the written
        document) within the performance but equally the presence of the performance
        inside the text means that there are, at any one moment in time, two irreducible
        modes of being present.&nbsp; As presence becomes the site of irreducibility,
        this will mean that presence can no longer be absolutely present
        to&nbsp;itself. The anoriginal marks the possibility of the poem being either
        potentially or actually plural, which will mean that the poem will always lack
        an essential unity.&nbsp; (Within the context <span class=GramE>of &nbsp;poetry</span>,
        what could be said to be lacking is an already given semantic and interpretive
        finitude, if not singularity, of the poem.)&nbsp; It is thus that there is no
        unity to be recovered, no task of thinking of the origin as such, since the
        origin, now the anorigin,&nbsp;is already that which resists the move to a
        synthetic unity. Any unity will be an after-effect.&nbsp; Such after-effects
        are comprised of given publications, performances, interpretations, or
        readings.&nbsp; The poem &ndash; that which is anoriginally plural &ndash; cannot be known
        as such because it cannot exist&nbsp;<i>as such.</i><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a

        </span>The relation of a poem to variations created in a poetry reading has
        not, so far as I know, received previous attention. Variations created in
        performing &ldquo;oral&rdquo; poetry is, however, a subject of Gregory Nagy&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Poetry
          and Performance</i>, where, speaking of both the Homeric epics and troubadour
        poetry, Nagy writes, &ldquo;to perform the song &hellip; is to recompose it, to change it,
        to&nbsp;<i>move</i>&nbsp;it.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn7"><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref7'>&nbsp;[6]&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-bookmark:
_ftnref7'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref7'></span>Indeed, Nagy&rsquo;s
  &ldquo;poetics of variation&rdquo; is suggested by two variant epithets for the nightingale
        in&nbsp;<i>The Odyssey</i>&nbsp;&ndash; where the nightingale can be understood as a
        metaphor for the performer of poetry: &ldquo;patterning many different ways&rdquo; (49-50)
        and also &ldquo;with many resoundings&rdquo; (39).&nbsp; Nagy quotes Alfred Lord&rsquo;s study of
        Homer,&nbsp;<i>The Singer of Tales</i>:<span style='font-family:"Times",serif'>

      <p>Our real difficulty arises from the fact that, unlike the oral poet, we are
        not accustomed to thinking in terms of fluidity. We find it difficult to grasp
        something that is&nbsp;<i>multiform</i>. It seems ideal to us to construct an
        ideal text or to seek an&nbsp;<i>original</i>, and we remain dissatisfied with
        an ever-changing phenomenon.&nbsp; I believe that once we know the facts of
        oral composition we must cease to find an&nbsp;<i>original</i>&nbsp;of any
        traditional song. From an oral point of view each performance is&nbsp;<i>original</i>.<a

        </span>The poetry reading, considered along with typographic, holographic, and
        contextual variants, modulates and deepens what McGann calls the &ldquo;textual
        condition.&rdquo; The poetry reading extends the patterning of poetry into another
        dimension, adding another semantic layer to the poem&rsquo;s multiformity.&nbsp; The
        effect is to create a space of authorial resistance to textual authority.&nbsp;
        For while writing is normally &ndash;if reductively and counterproductively<a

        viewed as stabilizing and fixing oral poetic traditions, authorial poetry
        readings are best understood as destabilizing, by making more fluid and
        pluriform, an aural (post-written) poetic practice. And here the double sense
        of reading is acutely relevant. For in realizing, by supplementing, the
        semantic possibilities of the poem in a reading, the poet encourages readers to
        perform the poem on their own, a performance that is allowed greater latitude
        depending on how reading-centered the poem is &ndash; that is, how much the poem
        allows for the active participation of the reader (in both senses) in the
        constitution of the poem&rsquo;s meaning.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        I am proposing that we look at the poetry reading not as a secondary extension <span
class=GramE>of&nbsp; &ldquo;</span>prior&rdquo; written texts but as its own medium. What,
        then, are the characteristics specific to this medium and what can it do that
        other live performance media &ndash; instrumental music, song and opera, theater &ndash;
        cannot?&nbsp; The answer may be found in what seems to many the profoundly
        anti-performative nature of the poetry reading: the poetry reading as radically
  &ldquo;poor theater&rdquo; in Jerzy Grotowski&rsquo;s sense.&nbsp; If that is true, it may show
        how what some find as the most problematic aspect of the poetry reading may
        turn out to be its essence: that is, its lack of spectacle, drama, and dynamic
        range, as exemplified especially in a certain minimal &ndash; anti-expressivist &ndash;
        mode of reading. I&rsquo;m tempted to label this mode&nbsp;<i>anti-performative</i>&nbsp;to
        suggest a kind of rhetorical (in the stylisitc sense of &ldquo;antirhetorical&rdquo;)
        strategy and not to suggest it is any less a performance choice than the most
  &ldquo;theatrical&rdquo; reading. (John Cage&rsquo;s poetry readings are a good example of this
        mode.) In an age of spectacle and high drama, the anti-expressivist poetry
        reading stands out as an oasis of low technology that is among the least
        spectaclized events in our public culture.&nbsp; Explicit value is placed
        almost exclusively on the acoustic production of a single unaccompanied
        speaking voice, with all other theatrical elements being placed, in most cases,
        out of frame. The solo voice so starkly framed can come to seem virtually
        disembodied in an uncanny, even hypnotic, way. Such poetry readings share the
        intimacy of radio or of small ensemble or chamber music. In contrast to
        theater, where the visual spectacle creates a perceived distance separating
        viewers from viewed, the emphasis on sound in the poetry reading has the
        opposite effect &ndash; it physically connects the speaker and listener, moving to
        overcome the self-consciousness of the performance context. <span class=GramE>Indeed,&nbsp;
          the</span> anti-expressivist<i>&nbsp;</i>mode of reading works to defeat the
        theatricality of the performance situation, to allow the listener to enter into
        a concave acoustic space rather than be pushed back from it, as in a more
        propulsive reading mode (which creates a convex acoustic space). When a poem
        has an auditory rather than a visual source (the heard performance rather than
        the read text), our perspective on, or of, the work shifts.&nbsp; Rather than
        looking at the poem &ndash; at the words on a page &ndash; we may enter into it, perhaps to
        get lost, perhaps to lose ourselves, our (nonmetrical) &ldquo;footing&rdquo; with one
        another. According to Charles Lock, &ldquo;the absence or presence of perspective
        marks the crucial difference between &lsquo;pictorial&rsquo; and &lsquo;symbolic&rsquo; signs, both of
        which are &lsquo;visual.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn10"><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref10'>[9]&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref10'></span></a><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref10'></span>For a text is the only visual sign system
        that, as Lock puts it, is &ldquo;entirely free of perspective&rdquo; (418). Like a text,
        auditory phenomena do not permit perspective but they do have an auditory
        version of perspective,&nbsp;<i>location</i>, and that is a constitutive
        element of the medium of the poetry reading.

      <p>This formalist approach to the poetry reading may explain the common
        dislike, among poets, of actors&rsquo; reading of poems; for this <span class=GramE>registers</span> not a dislike of vocalization but of a style of acting that frames the
        performance in terms of character, personality, setting, gesture, development,
        or drama, even though these may be extrinsic to the text at hand. That is, the
  &ldquo;acting&rdquo; takes precedence over letting the words speak for themselves (or worse
        eloquence compromises, not to say eclipses,&nbsp;the ragged music of the poem).
        The project of the poetry reading, from this formalist perspective, is to find
        the sound in the words, not in any extrinsic scenario or supplemental
        accompaniment. Without in any way wishing to undermine the more extravagantly
        theatrical style of reading, I would point to this more monovalent, minimally
        inflected, and in any case unaugmented, mode as touching on the essence of the
        medium. For poetry cannot, and need not, compete with music in terms of
        acoustic complexity or rhythmic force, or with theater in terms of spectacle.
        What is unique, and in its own way exhilarating, about the performance of
        poetry is that it does what it does within the limits of language alone.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        (Let me note here Peter Quartermain&rsquo;s caution, in&nbsp;<i>Close Listening</i>,
        that the poet&rsquo;s voicing of a poem should not be allowed to eliminate ambiguous
        voicings in the text; nor should the author&rsquo;s performance of a poem be
        absolutely privileged over that of other readers and performers.)&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        The (unaccompanied) performance of poetry has as its upper limit music, as
        realized in what has come to be called sound poetry, and its lower limit
        silence, as realized in what has come to be called visual poetry.&nbsp; Visual
        poetry gets us to look at works as well as read them, while sound poetry gets
        us to hear as well as listen.&nbsp; Curiously, these two limits intersect, as
        when a visual poem is performed as a sound poem or a sound poem is scored as a
        visual poem. It&rsquo;s important, however,&nbsp;to stay focussed on the poetry
        reading in the ordinary sense, since it seems to me that this mode of reading
        is most critically neglected &ndash; or perhaps just taken for granted, if not
        derided. Even those sympathetic to performed poetry will remark that most poets
        can&rsquo;t read their work, as if such a sentiment suggests a defect with the medium
        of poetry readings. One might say that most of the poems published in books or
        magazines are dull without that observation reflecting on poetry as a medium.
        Perhaps it makes most sense to say that if you don&rsquo;t like a poet&rsquo;s reading it
        is because you don&rsquo;t like the poetry, to pick up on an observation of Aldon
        Nielsen on a recent internet discussion list. There are no poets whose work I
        admire whose readings have failed to engage me, to enrich my hearing of the
        work. That is not to say, however, that some readings don&rsquo;t trouble or
        complicate my understanding or appreciation. For related reasons, I am quite
        interested in audio recording of poetry readings. If, as I am suggesting,
        poetry readings foreground the audible acoustic text of the poem &ndash; what I want
        to call the audiotext of the poem, specifically extending Garrett Stewart&rsquo;s
        term&nbsp;<i>phonotext</i>&nbsp;&ndash; then audio reproduction is ideally suited to
        the medium.&nbsp; (Video, it seems to me, is often less engaging for poetry,
        since the typically depleted visual resources &ndash; static shots of a person at a
        podium &ndash; are no match for the sound track and tend to flatten out the affective
        dimension of the live performance. For me, the most energetic and formally
        engaging cinematic extension of the poetry reading are a series of films made
        from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s by Henry Hills, especially&nbsp;<i>Plagiarism</i>,&nbsp;<i>Radio
          Adios</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Money.</i>)&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        What is the relation of sound to meaning? Any consideration of the poetry
        reading must give special significance to this question since poetry readings
        are acoustic performances that foreground the audiotext of the poem. One way of
        approaching this issue is to emphasize the oral dimension of poetry, the origins
        of the sounds of language in speech. And <span class=GramE>of course</span> many poets do wish to identify their performance with just such an orality,
        even to the extent of stressing a &ldquo;return&rdquo; to a more &ldquo;vital&rdquo; cultural past,
        before the advent of writing. But I am interested in a broader range of
        performance practice than is suggested by orality; in fact, some of the most
        interesting poetry reading styles &ndash; from Jackson Mac Low to Stein to T. S.
        Eliot &ndash; defy orality in very specific ways: Eliot through his eerily
        depersonalized vocal style (emanating from the mouth more than the diaphragm);
        Stein with her all-over, modulating or cubist, resonances; and Mac Low with his
        immaculate enunciation of constructed word patterns. Orality can be understood
        as a stylistic or even ideological marker of a reading style; in contrast, the
        audiotext might more usefully be understood as aural &ndash; what the ear hears.
        By&nbsp;<i>aurality</i>&nbsp;I mean to emphasize the sounding of the&nbsp;<i>writing</i>,
        and to make a sharp contrast with&nbsp;<i>orality</i>&nbsp;and its emphasis on
        breath, voice, and speech &ndash; an emphasis that tends to valorize speech over
        writing, voice over sound, listening over hearing, and indeed, orality over
        aurality.&nbsp;<i>Aurality precedes orality</i>, just as language precedes
        speech. Aurality is connected to the body &ndash; what the mouth and tongue and vocal
        chords enact &ndash; not the presence of the poet; it is proprioceptive in Charles
        Olson&rsquo;s sense. The poetry reading enacts the poem not the poet; it materializes
        the text not the author; it performs the work, not the one who composed it. In
        short, the significant fact of the poetry reading is less the presence of the
        poet than the presence of the poem. My insistence on aurality is not intended
        to valorize the material ear over the metaphysical mouth but to find a term
        that averts the identification of orality with speech. Aurality is meant to
        invoke a performative sense of &ldquo;phonotext&rdquo; or audiotext and might better be
        spelled a/orality.<br>
  <br>
        The audiotext, in the sense of the poet&rsquo;s acoustic performance, is a semantically
        denser field of linguistic activity than can be charted by means of meter,
        assonance, alliteration, rhyme, and the like (although these remain underlying
        elements of this denser linguistic field). Thinking in terms of the performance
        of the poem reframes many of the issues labored over by prosodists examining
        the written text of poems, often syllable by syllable, phoneme by phoneme,
        accent by accent, foot by foot, stress by stress, beat by beat, measure by
        measure. The poem performed conforms even less to analysis of syllable and
        stress than the poem as read. Many prosodists have insisted that the (musical)
        phrase provides a more useful way of understanding poetry&rsquo;s sound patterns than
        do accentual systems, whether quantitative or syllabic, that break poetry into
        metrical feet. Consideration of the performed word supports that view, although
        the concept of phrasing and of musicality is much expanded when one moves from
        the metrical to the acoustic, beyond &ldquo;free verse&rdquo; to sound shapes.&nbsp; For one
        thing, the dynamics charted by accentual prosodies have a <span class=GramE>much
          diminished</span> place in the sound environment of a poetry reading, where
        intonations, pitch, tempos, accents (in the other sense of pronunciation),
        grain or timbre of voice, nonverbal face and body expressions or movements, as
        well as more conventional prosodic features such as assonance, alliteration,
        and rhyme, take on a significant role. But more importantly, regularizing
        systems of prosodic analysis break down before the sonic profusion of a reading:
        it&rsquo;s as if &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo; sound patterns are being measured by grid-oriented
        coordinates whose reliance on context-independent ratios is inadequate. The
        poetry reading is always at the edge of semantic excess, even if any given
        reader stays on this side of the border. In fact, one of the primary techniques
        of poetry performance is the disruption of rationalizable patterns of sound
        through the intervallic irruption of acoustic elements not recuperable by
        monologic analysis. While these irruptions may be highly artful, they may also
        fall into the body&rsquo;s rhythms &ndash; gasps, stutters, hiccups, burps, coughs, slurs,
        microrepetitions, oscillations in volume, &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; pronunciations, and so on
  &ndash; that is, if you take these elements to be semantic features of the performed
        poem, as I propose, and not as extraneous interruption.<a name="_ftnref11"></a><a

      <p>Prosody is too dynamic a subject to be restricted to conventionally metrical
        verse. Yet many accounts of poetry continue to reduce questions of poetic
        rhythm to meter or regularized stress, as if nonmetrical poetry, especially the
        more radically innovative poetry of this century, were not&nbsp;<i>more</i>rhythmically
        and acoustically rich than its so-called formalist counterparts. In the
        acoustic space of performed poetry, I would emphasize&nbsp;<i>distress</i>&nbsp;and
        asymmetry, as much as accentual patter: dissonance and irregularity, rupture
        and silence constitute a rhythmic force (or&nbsp;<i>aversion of force</i>) in
        the sounded poem<i>.</i><a name="_ftnref12"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn12"><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref12'>[11]&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref12'></span></a><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref12'></span>Such counterrhythmic elements create,
        according to Giorgio Agamben, &ldquo;a mismatch, a disconnection between the metrical
        and syntactic elements, between sounding rhythm and meaning, such that
        (contrary the received opinion that sees in poetry<i>&nbsp;</i>the locus of an
        accomplished and a perfect fit between sound and meaning) poetry lives,
        instead, only in their inner disagreement. In the very moment when verse
        affirms its own identity by breaking a syntactic link, it is irresistibly drawn
        into bending over into the next line to lay hold of what it has thrown out of
        itself.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn13"><span style='mso-bookmark:

  <br>
        If studies of prosody foundered in the early twentieth century on the inability
        to reconcile the musicality of poetry with strictly metrical classifications,
        then recitation usefully transforms the object of study from meter to rhythm,
        to use the distinction made by Henri Meschonnic, for whom meter is asocial and
        without meaning, while rhythm is grounded in the historicity of the poem and
        implies a sociality.<a name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn14"><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref14'>&nbsp;[13]&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-bookmark:
_ftnref14'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref14'></span>The issue is
        not the written &ndash; the text &ndash; versus the oral, but the embodied acoustic
        performance &ndash; the aurality of the work &ndash; versus an abstract or external
        idealization that is based on a projection of time as a &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; space, which
        is unilinear, homogenous, and incremental.&nbsp; The new prosody requires an
        engagement not with abstract time but with duration and its microtones,
        discontinuities, striations, and disfluencies. Traditional metrics, with its
        metronomic beats, remains a fundamentally Euclidean system that is unsuited to
        a full measuring of the complex prosodies of the twentieth century or,
        moreover, much older poetry as well as the verbal art of cultures that fall
        outside the purview of traditional Western literary criticism.<br>
  <br>
        In performance, meter is eclipsed by isochrony &ndash; the unwritten tempo (rhythmic,
        cyclical, overlapping) whose beat is audible in the performance as distinct
        from the text. In&nbsp;<i>Free Verse: An Essay on Prosody</i>, Charles Hartman
        quotes Karl Shapiro&rsquo;s comment that isochrony &ldquo;equalizes unequal accentual
        elements by varying the&nbsp;<i>time</i>&nbsp;of feet, whether in the ear or in
        the recitation.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref15"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn15"><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref15'>&nbsp;[14]&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-bookmark:
_ftnref15'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref15'></span>&nbsp;
        Hartman goes on to argue that &ldquo;equivalence <span class=GramE>&ldquo; has</span> &ldquo;only
        secondary bearing on English verse&rdquo; (38); to which I would say:&nbsp;<i>exactly
          the same secondary bearing as performance!</i>&nbsp;Insofar as the performed
        word is granted a reciprocal status to the text, isochrony becomes a dominant
        prosodic element, not just in the poetry reading but also in the silent reading
        (I would now say silent recitation) of the poem, as well as in the composition
        of poem &ndash; whether &ldquo;by ear&rdquo; (in Charles Olson&rsquo;s phrase) or by sentence (in Ron
        Silliman&rsquo;s). In short, recitation rests on temporal rather than syllabic or
        accentual measure, which themselves may become secondary. This greatly expands
        the sense of isochrony from slight variations of non-stressed syllables to
        larger acoustic and lettristic units, and indeed the sort of isochronic
        practice I have in mind would allow for the equivalence of temporally unequal
        units. For this complex or &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; prosody of sound shapes, such polyrhythmic
        equivalencies are created by performed pauses, syncopations, emphasis, as well
        as shifts in tempo and pitch; just as on the page equivalencies are indicated
        by visual organization (lines irrespective of tempo), by nonmetrical counting
        (of syllables or words), and the like.&nbsp; The page&rsquo;s enjambment and
        syntactic scissoring become performance&rsquo;s isochronic disruption of syntactic
        flow, creating a contra-sense rhythm (or anti-rhythm) that is abetted by
        breaking, pausing (temporal caesura), and other techniques that go against the
        flow of speech rhythms.&nbsp; Isochrony may also be used to create a stereo or
        holographic effect, for example in the intense overlapping phrasal units in
        Leslie Scalapino&rsquo;s readings.

        I am discussing in the context of performance, it is often possible to hear
        such rhythmic and arhythmic patterns in the process of close listening to the
        written text of the poem, as in Stein&rsquo;s aptly titled prose-format poem&nbsp;<i>How
          to Writ</i>e. Gerard Manley Hopkins&rsquo;s marvelously delirious attempts to
        visually mark such patterns in his texts is exemplary.) Performance also
        underscores (or should I say underwrites?) a prosodic movement of which I am
        particularly fond, in which the poem suggests a certain rhythmic pattern over
        the course of perhaps, a few lines, then segues into an incommensurable
        pattern, sometimes shuttling between the two, sometimes adding a third or fourth
        pattern: the prior pattern continues on underneath as a sort of sonic
        afterimage, creating a densely layered, or braided, or chordal, texture. The
        complex or fuzzy prosodics of such sprung rhythm produces the acoustic
        equivalent of a moir&eacute; pattern.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Performance also allows for the maximum inflection of different, possibly
        dissonant, voices: a multivocality that foregrounds the dialogic dimension of
        poetry.&nbsp; Hannah Weiner&rsquo;s performance of her&nbsp;<i>Clairvoyant Journal</i>&nbsp;is
        an exhilarating example &ndash; three competing voices of one &ldquo;self&rdquo; collide with one
        another in an electric ensemble consisting of Weiner, Peggy DeCoursey and
        Sharon Matlin in a tape published by New Wilderness Audiographics in 1976. But
        I am equally interested in the possibility of slippage among tones, dictions,
        accents, and registers in polyvocal performances in which different voices are
        evoked using performative cues rather than alphabetic ones. The potential here
        is to create rhythms and voicings that are not only supplemental to the written
        text but also at odds with it.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Such poetry is more usefully described as polymetrical or plurimetircal than as
  &ldquo;free&rdquo;; still, our technical vocabulary strains at accounting for more than a
        small portion of the acoustic activity of the sounded poem and there are a
        number of performative features that are only available in readings (in both
        senses) since they are not (readily) scorable in the lexical text.&nbsp; Ernest
        Robson, going steps further than Hopkins, developed an elaborate and eccentric
        system for scoring pitch and stress in the written texts of his poems.<a
name="_ftnref16"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn16"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref16'>[15]&nbsp;</span><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref16'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref16'></span>Among
        the most resourceful attempts to designate acoustic features of performed
        poetry has been Erskine Peters&rsquo;s, in his work-in-progress&nbsp;<i>Afro-Poetics
          in the United States.</i>&nbsp; Peters, together with an associate at the
        University of Notre Dame, J. Sherman, has developed a &ldquo;special font to document
        the sounds, rhythms, and melodies of the Afro-poetic tradition.&rdquo;<a
name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn17"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref17'>&nbsp;[16]&nbsp;</span><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref17'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref17'></span>&nbsp;
        The sixty characters in Peters&rsquo;s system designate such acoustic figures as
        accelerated line pacing, accented long and short stretches, blue noting,
        bopping, calibrated stagger, call-response, chant, crypting, deliberate
        stutter, echo toning, extreme unaccented, falsetto, field hollering, gliding or
        glissando, glottal shake, guttural stress, humming, moan, ostinato, pegging,
        pitch alteration (heightened and lowered), quoting, riff, rushing, scatting,
        slurring (3 versions), sonorous chant stretching, sonorous inhaling, sonorous
        moaning, sonorous tremor, spiking, syllabic quaver, tremolo, and ululating
        rhythm.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        One reason that Hopkins figures so prominently in&nbsp;<i>Close Listening</i>&nbsp;is
        that he initiates, within the English tradition, a complex prosody that
        requires performance to sound it out. With rational metrics, the &ldquo;competent&rdquo;
        reader could be presumed to be able to determine the poem&rsquo;s sound based on
        well-established principles. With complex prosody and poylmetricality, however,
        the performance establishes the sound of the poem in a way not necessarily, or
        not easily, deducible from the text.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Despite these many examples, many poetry performances tend to submit to, rather
        than prosodically contest, the anesthetized speech rhythms of official verse
        culture. Indeed, one of the effects of chatty introductions before each poem is
        to acoustically cue the performer&rsquo;s talking voice so that it frames the
        subsequent performance. David Antin radically extends and transforms such talk
        to become the main event of his performances, or &ldquo;talk pieces,&rdquo; which remain
        among the postwar period&rsquo;s most provocative critiques of &ndash; and useful
        interventions within &ndash;&nbsp;the poetry reading. Conversely, when a poet makes
        no incidental remarks, it may be to allow the sound of the poem to have its
        full sway. Clark Coolidge is a particularly adept practitioner of this style,
        and his remarkable extensions and riffs on speech rhythms are all the more
        resonant on account of it.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        What makes sound patterns expressive? Beats me. But a rose by any other name
        would no longer rhyme with doze or shows or clothes, unless the other name was
        pose or glows. A rose by any other name wouldn&rsquo;t be the same &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t arouse
        the same associations, its sound iconicity might be close but no pajamas. Sound
        enacts meaning as much as designates something meant.

  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>The relation of sound to meaning is something like the relation of the soul
        (or mind) to the body. They are aspects of each other, neither prior, neither
        independent. To imagine that a meaning might be the same despite a change of
        words is something like imagining that I&rsquo;d still be me in a new body. (<span
class=GramE>So</span> disagreements on this matter are theological as much as
        metaphysical &ndash; they cannot be reduced to factual disputes.) It won&rsquo;t come as a
        big surprise to most people that a poet is investing so much in sound &ndash; no
        doubt we&rsquo;ve been seduced into confusing the shell for the husk, or is it the
        pea for the nut? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
style='font-family:"Times",serif'>
  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>J. H. Prynne, in &ldquo;Stars, Tigers and the Shape of Words,&rdquo; makes the argument
        quite well, though it does bear repeating, since repetition is never
        interesting for what is the same but for what is different: While verbal
        language may be described as a series of differential sound values, and while
        it makes sense to say that it is these differences that allow for meaning, it
        does not follow that the only meaning these sounds have lies in their
        difference from other sounds. Positive meanings adhere to sound in a number of
        ways. To speak of the positive, rather than merely negative or differential,
        meaning of sound does not rely on what might be called &ldquo;pure&rdquo; sound symbolism &ndash;
        the perception that particular sounds and dynamic features of sounds (as in
        pitch, constellations of sound, intonation, amplitude, timbre) have intrinsic
        meaning; though there is much that is appealing in this view, as Walter
        Benjamin shows in his &ldquo;Doctrine of the Similar.&rdquo; The claim that certain sound
        vibrations have an inhering or immutable meaning is the perhaps mystical nodal
        point of a constellation of iconic attributes of language. Other points in this
        constellation cluster around the purely extrinsic meanings that adhere to
        sounds and dynamic features of sounds, either based on historical associations,
        which over time get hard-wired into some words or sounds; or, more intricately,
        based on the oral range made possible by a specific dietary pattern that alters
        the body&rsquo;s sounding board (dentation, palette, vocal chords, breath).&nbsp;
        Each language&rsquo;s specific morphology allows many possibilities for iconicity &ndash;
        from the physical size or&nbsp;number of characters in a word, to the number of
        syllables or patterns of syllables in a word, to associations with timbre or
        intonation or patterning. Iconicity refers to the ability of language to&nbsp;<i>present</i>,
        rather than represent or designate, its meaning. Here meaning is not something
        that accompanies the word but is performed by it. One of the primary features
        of poetry as a medium is to foreground the various iconic features of language
  &ndash; to perform the verbalness of language. The poetry reading, as much as the
        page, is the site for such performance.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Iconicity can also provide a way of hearing poetry readings, where the iconic
        focus shifts from an individual word to the chosen mode of performance; for
        example, the stress and tempo. I have already given an iconic reading of
        Baraka&rsquo;s performance style. John Ashbery&rsquo;s relatively monovalent, uninflected
        reading style &ndash; he is surely one of the masters of the anti-expressivist mode &ndash;
        is marked by an absence of isochronicity, a correlate to the fluidity and
        marked absence of parataxis in his texts. The cutting out of this rhythmic
        dynamic is iconically significant.

      <p>It is certainly not my intention to reinvent the wheel, just to let it spin
        words into acts. Any consideration of the relation of sound to poetry needs to
        point to the pioneering work of linguists such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Roman
        Jakobson, Linda Waugh, George Lakoff, and many others. In a recent treatment of
        this topic,&nbsp;<i>What Makes Sound Patterns Expressive</i>, Reuven Tsur quite
        usefully emphasizes a distinction between the perception of speech sounds (the
  &ldquo;speech mode&rdquo; of listening) and material sounds (the &ldquo;nonspeech mode&rdquo;).<a
name="_ftnref18"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn18"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref18'>&nbsp;[17]&nbsp;</span><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref18'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref18'></span>He
        argues that there is a marked cognitive difference in the way a listener hears
        a material sound &ndash; say a flapping flag or the pouring rain &ndash; and the way she or
        he hears human speech. Speech triggers a specific cognitive mode of
        interpretation in a way that material sound does not. This is something like
        the distinction Roland Barthes makes, in an essay called &ldquo;Listening,&rdquo; between
        hearing (physiological) and listening (psychological).<a name="_ftnref19"></a><a
href="close-listening.html#_ftn19"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref19'>&nbsp;[18]</span><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref19'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref19'></span>According
        to Tsur, and following Jakobson, the &ldquo;poetic function&rdquo; of language is a third
        type: it involves&nbsp;<i>hearing</i>&nbsp;what we are&nbsp;<i>listening</i>&nbsp;to.
        That is, poetry creates something of the conditions of hearing (not just
        listening to) a foreign language &ndash; we hear it as language, not music or noise;
        yet we cannot immediately process its meaning. Another way of saying this is
        that the poetic function &ndash; what Tsur calls &ldquo;the poetic mode of speech
        perception&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp; rematerializes language, returns it from &ldquo;speech&rdquo; back to
  &ldquo;sound&rdquo;; or rather, the poetic mode synthesizes the speech mode of perception
        and the nonspeech mode of perception. I want to project this frame of reference
        onto Barthes&rsquo;s evocative speculations on rhythm in &ldquo;Listening.&rdquo; Barthes uses
        Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s famous discussion of the child&rsquo;s game of&nbsp;<i>fort</i>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>da</i>,
        in which the child tosses out and pulls back a spool attached to a thread, as
        an example of a primal rhythmic oscillation of presence and absence, miming the
        presence and absence of the mother at the same time as it makes palpable the
        structure of the linguistic sign.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as if when I <span class=GramE>say</span> &ldquo;you&rsquo;re here&rdquo; / &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not&rdquo; the sounds are present but&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;are
        not. In the poetic mode of listening, there is an oscillation (or temporal
        overlap) between the materially present sound (hearing: the nonspeech mode) and
        the absent meaning (listening: the speech mode): this is a satisfaction of all
        reading aloud, as when we read stories and poems to children. The poetry
        reading allows for a particularly marked extension of this pleasure, especially
        when the performance seizes the opportunity to make rhythmic oscillations
        between its opaque soundings and its transparent references.&nbsp; No doubt
        this helps to explain the uncanny power of a great sound poem like Kurt
        Schwitters&rsquo;s &ldquo;Merz Sonata,&rdquo; with its exquisite passages of child-like entoning,
        which evoked tears from its first hearers. But it also a quality inherent in
        the structure &ndash; the medium &ndash; of the poetry reading itself, and it can be found
        in its most ordinary forms.&nbsp; In this way, the poetry reading occupies a
        formal space akin to song, but one in which the musicality, or sound-grounding,
        of the language is produced strictly within the range of speech-mode
        perception.&nbsp; It is the transformation of language to sound, rather than
        the setting of language in sound, that distinguishes song from recitation.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-family:

  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>As a matter of habituated fact, the distinction between speech perception
        and sound perception seems well established. I do hear the beat of a hammer,
        the lapping of water, or the bleat of a sheep in a way that is cognitively
        discontinuous with the way I listen to human speech. With the speech in which I
        am most at home, I automatically translate streams of sounds into streams of
        words with a rapidity and certainty that makes the sounds transparent &ndash; a
        conjuring trick that is slowed by variant accents and arrested by foreign
        tongues. But this transparency effect of language may be less an intrinsic
        property of speech than a sign of our opaqueness to the transhuman world, which
        also speaks, if we could learn (again) to listen, as writers from Henry David
        Thoreau in&nbsp;<i>Walden</i>&nbsp;to, most recently, David Abram in&nbsp;<i>The
          Spell of the Sensuous&nbsp;</i>have argued. &ldquo;It is animate earth that speaks;
        human speech is but a part of that vaster discourse&rdquo; (Abram, 179). Yet language
        is not just a part of the &ldquo;animate earth,&rdquo; its sounds also echo the music of
        the&nbsp;<i>nonanimate</i>&nbsp;earth. Speech-mode perception, as an habituated
        response to language, may indeed preemptively cut off our response to nonhuman
        sounds &ndash; organic and machinic &ndash; at <span class=GramE>the&nbsp; same</span> time
        as it dematerializes human language, muting its sonic roots in the earth as
        well as the world. Yet while Abram argues that our alienation from the sensuous
        is partly to be blamed on alphabetic writing, I would emphasize &ndash; against such
        self-proclaimed &ldquo;oralist&rdquo; perspectives &ndash; that our insistent separation of human
        and nonhuman sounds is not the result of writing (alphabetic or otherwise) but
        of human language itself.<a name="_ftnref20"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn20"><span

_ftnref20'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref20'></span>Alphabetic
        aurality is not cut-off from the earth but is a material embodiment of
        it.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        In attributing the transparency effect of language to speech-mode perception, I
        am eliding two prominent developmental models that provide powerful accounts of
        how and when language works to differentiate its users from their sensorial
        surroundings. In&nbsp;<i>Revolution of Poetic Language</i>, Julia Kristeva
        writes of infancy as an absorption in a pre-verbal &ldquo;chora&rdquo; that is (tellingly)
        a &ldquo;rhythmic space&rdquo; that&nbsp; &ldquo;precedes evidence, verisimilitude, spatiality,
        and temporality&rdquo; and indeed &ldquo;figuration.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref21"></a><a
href="close-listening.html#_ftn21"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref21'>[20]&nbsp;</span><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref21'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref21'></span>Kristeva
        goes on to theorize the subsequent development of a symbolic order in which a
  &ldquo;subject&rdquo; emerges from the chora when the child is able to differentiate
        herself from her surrounds.&nbsp; For Kristeva, the chora &ndash; which she
        associates with radically poetic language &ndash; is anterior to &ldquo;sign and syntax,&rdquo;
        anterior to the linguistic order of language: &ldquo;Indifferent to language,
        enigmatic and feminine, this space underlying the written is rhythmic,
        unfettered, irreducible to its intelligible verbal translation; it is musical,
        anterior to judgment, but restrained by a single guarantee: syntax&rdquo; (29). Abram
        and Walter Ong write not of the development of individual subjects but of human
        culture, charting the alienation that alphabetic writing inaugurates in
        previously oral cultures in terms of the loss of the &ldquo;presence&rdquo; of the word,
        for Ong, and the loss of language&rsquo;s interconnectivity with the more-than-human
        world, for Abram. Yet both of these accounts rely on unilinerar, progressivist
        models of development. The implication is that one stage of human consciousness
        replaces or supersedes the next and that something like &ldquo;poetic&rdquo; language is
        needed to put us back in touch with &ndash; to return us to, or retune us with &ndash; the
        previous stage.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        The problem is that writing does not eclipse orality nor does the symbolic law
        supercede the amorphousness of the &ldquo;semiotic,&rdquo; any more than objectivity
        replaces subjectivity (or vice versa). We don&rsquo;t return to anything &ndash; turning
        (tuning) is enough. The power of symbolic &ndash; of the ego or the alphabet &ndash; does
        not come in Faustian trade for the virtually Edenic space of undifferentiated
        connectivity. Moreover, this originary myth is literally delusional, for it
        leads us away from the concrete material situation of our connectivity through
        the alphabet, through aurality, <span class=GramE>through&nbsp; the</span> &ldquo;symbolic.&rdquo; Better than to speak of the preverbal, we might speak of the
        omniverbal. Rather than referring to the presymbolic, we might say asymbolic or
        heterosymbolic. Instead of projecting a preliterate stage we might say
        analphabetic or heteroliterate: for aren&rsquo;t the petroglyphs and megaliths &ndash;
        those earliest human inscriptions made on or with rocks &ndash; already writing,
        already &ldquo;symbolic.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref22"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn22"><span
style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref22'>&nbsp;[21]&nbsp;</span><span style='mso-bookmark:
_ftnref22'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref22'></span>&nbsp; As if
        the first human &ldquo;babbling&rdquo; were not already language, always social, a toll as
        well as a tool! We go &ldquo;From amniotic fluid to / semiotic / fluidlessness,&rdquo;
        where the semiotic is drenched in the symbolic and the symbolic absorbed within
        the semiotic.<a name="_ftnref23"></a><a href="close-listening.html#_ftn23"><span style='mso-bookmark:

style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref23'></span>&nbsp; As Nick Piombino observes in his
        discussion of D. W. Winnicott in&nbsp;<i>Close Listening,&nbsp;language is also
          a&nbsp;transitional object</i>.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        If &ldquo;orality&rdquo; or the &ldquo;semiotic,&rdquo; aurality or logic, are stages, they are stages
        not on a path toward or away from immanence or transcendence but rather stages
        for performance:&nbsp;<i>modalities</i>&nbsp;of reason;&nbsp;<i>prisms&nbsp;</i>not<i>&nbsp;</i>prisons.
        Or let me put this in a different way: Perhaps the first writing was not
        produced by humans <span class=GramE>but&nbsp; rather</span>&nbsp;<i>recognized</i>&nbsp;by
        humans. That is, it&rsquo;s possible that the human inscriptions on the petroglyphs
        frame or acknowledge the glyphs already present on the rock face (Lock,
        415-16). Then we might speak of the book of nature, which we read as we read
        geologic markers or the rings around a tree (&ldquo;can&rsquo;t see me!&rdquo;).

      <p>Poetry characterized as pre-symbolic (and praised or condemned as primitive,
        infantile or child-like, nonsensical, meaningless) would more accurately be
        characterized as post-symbolic (and thus described as paratactic, complex or
        chaotic, procreative, hyperreferential); just as such works, when they aver
        rationality, are not irrational. Rather, such works affirm the bases of reason
        against a dehumanizing fixation on the rigidly monologic and rationalistic. The
        problem is being stuck in any one modality of language &ndash; not being able to move
        in, around, and about the precincts of language. I am not anti-symbolic any
        more than I am pro<span class=GramE>-&ldquo;</span>semiotic.&rdquo; Rather I am
        interpolated in their folds, knowing one through the other, and hearing the
        echo of each in the next. This is what I mean to evoke by &ldquo;a/orality&rdquo; &ndash; sound
        language, language grounded in its embodiments.

      <p>Human consciousness has as much a sedimentary as a developmental
        disposition; stages don&rsquo;t so much replace each other as infiltrate or
        interpenetrate &ndash; I want to say&nbsp;<i>perform &ndash;</i>&nbsp;each other.
        Consciousness is a compost heap, to borrow a term from Jed Rasula. Neither the
        symbolic stage nor the rise of literacy marks language&rsquo;s de-absorption in the
        world. Language itself, speech itself, is a technology, a tool, that, from the
        first cultures to the first responses to the cry of a baby, allows us to make
        our way on the earth by making a world of it. The iconic sound shape of
        language beats the path. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

      <p>Iconicity recognizes the ability of language to present its meaning rather
        than to represent or designate it. The meaning is not something that
        accompanies the words but is performed by them. Performance has the potential
        to foreground the inexorable and &ldquo;counterlogical&rdquo; verbalness&nbsp; of poetry &ndash;
  &ldquo;thickening the medium&rdquo; by increasing &ldquo;the disparity between itself and its

        It is precisely because sound is an arational or nonlogical feature of language
        that it is so significant for poetry &ndash; for sound registers the sheer
        physicality of language, a physicality that must be the grounding of reason
        exactly insofar as it eludes rationality. Sound is language&rsquo;s flesh, its
        opacity as meaning marks its material embeddedness in the world of things.
        Sound brings writing back from its metaphysical and symbolic functions to where
        it is at home, in performance.

  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>Sound, like poetry &ldquo;itself,&rdquo; can never be completely recuperated as ideas,
        as content, as narrative, as extralexical meaning. The tension between sound
        and logic reflects the physical resistance in the medium of poetry. Rime&rsquo;s
        reason &ndash; the truth of sound &ndash; is that meaning is rooted in the arationality of
        sound, as well as in the body&rsquo;s multiple capacities for signification. Language
        is extra-lexical, goes beyond sense, and nothing shows this better than verbal
        performance, which, like the soundless performance of the body, exceeds what
        seems necessary to establish the substantive content of the poem &ndash; what it is
        saying, its metaphors and allusions.

      <p>In sounding language, we sound the width and breadth and depth of human
        consciousness &ndash; we find our bottom and our top, we find the scope of our ken.
        In sounding <span class=GramE>language</span> we ground ourselves as sentient,
        material beings, obtruding into the world with the same obdurate thingness as
        rocks or soil or flesh. We sing the body of language, relishing the vowels and
        consonants in every possible sequence. We stutter tunes with no melodies, only
        words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        And yet sound, while the primary focus of my considerations here, is only one
        iconically expressive medium of the performing body, and I specifically want to
        leave room for the apprehension, by non-acoustic means, of some of the features
        I have attributed to sound. I am thinking of a conversation I had with the
        English poet and performer Aaron Williamson, who is deaf, in which he noted
        that he is able to experience many of the physicalizing features I have
        discussed in terms of sound. Rhythm is an obvious but crucial example:
        Williamson pointed out that he could feel the rhythm of the poet&rsquo;s performance
        while reading and looking at (something akin to&nbsp;<i>listening&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;hearing</i>)
        the poet&rsquo;s lips. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
style='font-family:"Times",serif'>
  <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
      <p>Poetry readings, like reading aloud (and this is something most explicitly
        marked in sound poetry), are a performance of the carnality of language &ndash; its
        material, sensuous embodiment. But this bodily grounding of language is not a
        cause for celebration any more than it is a reason for repression: it is a
        condition of human being and a fundamental material for poetry; call it
        language&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>animalady</i>. Yet, in the present cultural context of the
        late twentieth century, this animalady loses its force as concrete experience
        when reified as (represented) speech or sentimentalized as (a return to)
        orality. The most resonant possibilities for poetry as a medium can be realized
        only when the performance of language moves from human speech to animate, but
        transhuman, sound: that is, when we stop listening and begin to hear; which is
        to say, stop decoding and begin to get a nose for the sheer noise of
        language.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Beyond all of these formal dimensions of the audiotext and the performed word,
        a primary significance of the poetry reading rests with its social character.
        Readings are the central social activity of poetry. They rival publishing as
        the most significant method of distribution for poetic works.&nbsp;They are as
        important as books and magazines in bringing poets into contact with one
        another, in forming generational and cross generational, cultural and
        cross-cultural, links, affinities, alliances, communities, scenes, networks,
        exchanges, and the like. While San Francisco and New York remain the centers of
        poetic activity in the United States, dozens of cities across the country, and
        in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain, have active local reading
        series that serve to galvanize local poetry activity. The range of such
        activity is so great as to be difficult to document, since the written record
        is so much poorer than that of publications. This absence of documentation,
        together with the tendency among critics and scholars to value the written over
        the performed text, has resulted in a remarkable lack of attention given to the
        poetry reading as a medium in its own right, a medium that has had a profound
        impact on twentieth century poetry, and in particular the poetry of the second
        half of the century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

      <p>The reading is the site in which the audience of poetry constitutes and
        reconstitutes itself. It makes itself visible to itself. And while the most attention
        had been paid to those moments when the poetry reading has been a means for
        poetry to cross over to a wider audience &ndash; as in the antiwar and other
        politically-oriented readings of the 1960s or in some of the performance poetry
        of the present moment &ndash; the fundamental, social significance of the reading, it
        seems to me, has to do with infrastructure not spectacle. For this <span
class=GramE>reason</span> I would turn around the familiar criticism that
        everyone at a poetry reading is a poet to say that this is just what is vital
        about a reading series, even the essence of the poetry reading.&nbsp; For
        poetry is constituted dialogically through recognition and exchange with an
        audience of peers, where the poet is not performing to invisible readers or
        listeners but actively exchanging work with other performers and participants.
        This is not to say that reading series geared to a more &ldquo;general&rdquo; public or to
        students are not valuable. <span class=GramE>Of course</span> they are. But
        such events resemble nonpoetry performances in that their value is
        dissemination to an unknown audience more than creation and exchange. They are
        not the foundries of poetry that a more introverted reading series can be.
        Poetry, oddly romanticized as the activity of isolated individuals writing
        monological lyrics, is among the most social and socially responsive &ndash; dialogic
  &ndash; of contemporary art forms. The poetry reading is an ongoing convention of
        poetry, by poetry, for poetry. In this sense, the reading remains one of the
        most participatory forms in American cultural life. Indeed, the value of the
        poetry reading as a social and cultural form can be partly measured by its
        resistance, up to this point, to reification or commodification.&nbsp;<i>It is
          a measure of its significance that it is ignored.</i>&nbsp;That is, the
        (cultural) invisibility of the poetry reading is what makes its audibility so
        audacious. Its relative absence as an institution makes the poetry reading the
        ideal site for the presence of language &ndash; for listening and being heard, for
        hearing and for being listened to.&nbsp;<br clear=all style='mso-special-character:

style='mso-bookmark:_ftn2'></span>There are only two collections that I have
        been able to locate that address the poetry reading:&nbsp;<i>Poets on Stage:
          The Some Symposium on Poetry Readings</i>, edited by Alan Zielger, Larry
        Zirlin, and Harry Greenberg in 1978 and&nbsp;<i>The Poetry Reading: A
          Contemporary Compendium on Language and Performance</i>, ed. Stephen Vincent
        and Ellen Zweig in 1981.&nbsp; The accounts of poetry readings in these
        pioneering collections are largely anecdotal.&nbsp; Also notable are the annual
        reports for 1981 and 1982 of San Francisco&rsquo;s 80 Langton Street Residency Program,
        assembled by Renny Pritikin, Barrett Watten, and Judy Moran, which provided a
        number sustained accounts, by different writers, of a series of talks and
        readings and performances at the space. More recently, the Poetics List, an
        electronic discussion group archived at the Electronic Poetry Center
        (http:/writing.upenn.edu/epc) often features accounts <span class=GramE>of&nbsp;
          readings</span> and conferences (including lists of those in attendance at
        readings and even the occasional fashion report). In contrast, reflecting
        standard academic practice, there is no mention of Wallace Stevens&rsquo;s recorded
        poetry performance in a <span class=GramE>recent&nbsp; book</span> on the poet
        by Anca Rosu, but there is some irony in this given the book&rsquo;s auspicious
        title,&nbsp;<i>The Metaphysics of Sound in Wallace Stevens</i>&nbsp;(Tuscaloosa:
        University of Alabama Press, 1995), which only goes to show that metaphysics
        tends to displace physics.<span style='font-family:"Times",serif'>

        nothing intrinsic to the alphabet that makes its effects on perception
        inevitable. Such writing has been used in many places and periods without any
        notion that it is an adequate or sufficient notation of the sounds of speech.
        What is rather as issue is the projection of phonemics (with its linear system
        of differences) back onto speech and its installation as the very foundation of
        a flattened (and &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;) conception of language. Yet we can recognize
        that the sounds coming from the next room are those of a person speaking&nbsp;<i>without
          being able to distinguish any phonemes</i>!&rdquo; (Personal communication, September
