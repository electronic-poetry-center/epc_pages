Pp. 298.       $35.00.       <!--_/bibliographic-->      <P align=justify>There are two domains of poetry too little attended: the         sound and the look. That is to say, <I>poetry</I> is too little attended:         sounds too quickly converted to words or images, the material space of         the page too quickly supplanted by the ideational space of the text (as         if MLA really meant "muted language association"). Too often, reading         habits enforce a kind of blindness to the particular graphic choices of         type, leading, page dimension, and paper, under the regime of a lexical         transcendentalism that accords no semantic value to the visual representation         of language.       <P align=justify>One poetic response to this derealization of poetry has         to insist, against all odds, that a work can be composed whose semantic         inhabitations are, if not "all" visual, then inescapably visual. Foregrounding         the visual dimension of the verbal domain--sounds like some sort of tap-dance         number by a performance artist called "The Wasted Apollinaires." The visibility         of the text thwarts the New Critical-cum-deconstructive sense of the linguistic         idea of the text: disrupting the idea of meaning as being hypermaterial         (beyond its material embodiments). As such, renewed critical and hermeneutical         attention to textual visibility is allied to the resurgence of bibliographic         and sociohistorical approaches in grounding poetry in its materially and         socially contexts, in and of the world. Two recent works exemplify this         movement: Jerome McGann's <I>Black Riders: The Visible Language of Modernism</I>         (1993) and Johanna Drucker's <I>The Visible Word.</I>       <P align=justify><I>The Visible Word</I> is a breakthrough study of the         materiality of the visual representation of language. Johanna Drucker         makes a fundamental contribution to aesthetics and the philosophy of language         as well as providing a cogent application of her theoretical investigations         to the visual and verbal arts of the modernist period.       <P align=justify>Drucker provides a powerful critique of repression of the         semantic contribution of the visible forms of writing, particularly typography,         in the French philosophical and linguistic tradition from the structuralism         inaugurated by Ferdinand de Saussure through such poststructuralist philosophers         as Jacques Derrida. She forces us to rethink a basic repression of the         materiality of language (sight and sound) that had gone unchallenged not         only within the French traditions and their American counterparts, but         also within the separate literary traditions of New Criticism (and their         successors) and the formalism of such art critics as <B>[End Page 173]</B>         Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried. No one before Drucker has made such         a comprehensive statement on this issue, although her study follows in         the wake of significant work in this area by Gerald Janacek, Marjorie         Perloff, Mary Ann Caws, Willard Bohn, and Dick Higgins.       <P align=justify>After its opening sallies against the windmills of linguistic         dematerialization, <I>The Visible Word</I> settles into a more practical         task: proving models for "close lookings" at the visual text of poems.         As a preface to this task, Drucker presents an illuminating reading/looking         at the interplay between the verbal and figural/visual elements of the         inaugural work for modernist visual poetry: Stéphane Mallarmé's <I>Un         Coup de dés.</I> In what proves to be a keynote of her antireductive interpretive         style, Drucker notes:       <BLOCKQUOTE>        <!--_extract-->        Mallarmé's concept of the figure is itself so abstract that his engagement         with the manipulation of material to figurative ends increases that antimimetic         ordering. It is in part for this reason that the work is so resistant         to interpretive closure. The "figures" refuse to be read in terms which         might reduce them to an equivalent either named or sketched. The textural         elements forge links of meaning in their visual and verbal relations but         those relations function as their own gestalt, not as the trace or image         of some other figurative form. [55]         <!--_/extract-->      </BLOCKQUOTE>      <P align=justify>This resistance to interpretive closure, however, is not         just a feature of <I>Un Coup de dés</I> but, Drucker argues, a feature         of the destabilization inherent in visual-verbal interactions of the radical         modernist typographic works that are the focus of her study.       <P align=justify>With Mallarmé as the starting point, Drucker proceeds to         reintegrate the common aesthetic and procedural approaches to materiality         in modernist visual and literary art in order to establish "experimental         typography as a modern art practice." At the same time, Drucker aims to         reverse the separation of the "purely visual" from the literary, which,         she notes, becomes a foundational idea in much modernist criticism. In         so doing, she charts how this highly problematic separation has played         itself out in terms of representation versus presence, <I>faktura</I>         versus autonomy. Drucker's revisionist history also questions the common         misconception that radical modernist art has a primary "concern for formal         values for their own sake" (67). By "debunking" such generalizations,         she shifts the terms of discussion onto "the structure of relations among         elements of signification" (67).       <P align=justify>In laying down the groundwork for interpreting typographic         works, Drucker stresses the distinction, already present in Gutenberg's         printing, between marked and unmarked texts:       <BLOCKQUOTE>        <!--_extract-->        [Gutenberg's] bibles, with their perfectly uniform grey pages, their uninterrupted         blocks of text, without headings of subheading . . . are the archetype         of the unmarked text, the text in which the words on the page "appear         to speak themselves" . . . Such a text appears to possess an authority         which transcends the mere material presence of words on a page . . . [95].         <!--_/extract-->      </BLOCKQUOTE>      <P align=justify>Drucker's book is a brief for the poetics of the marked         text. To make her case, she presents extended interpretations of the work         of four representative modernist figures, each of whom used typography         in strikingly innovative, but nonetheless dissimilar, ways. Her account         moves from the militant Italian Futurism of Filippo Tomasso Marinetti         to the vernacular lyricism of Guillaume Apollinaire and from the "hermetic         esotericism" of Ilia Zdanevich (Iliazd), a Russian <I>zaum</I> poet who         emigrated to Paris, to the highly rhetorical Dada subversions of Tristan         Tzara.       <P align=justify>Drucker traces the origins of modernist typographic experimentation,         as represented by Marinetti, Zdanevich, Apollinaire, and Tzara, not only         to Mallarmé but also both to the print <B>[End Page 174]</B> advertising         of the late nineteenth century and to the typographic self-consciousness         of, for example, William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Despite         the sharp aesthetic, social, and political differences among these typographic         practices, Drucker sees their use of marked texts as "aggressively situat[ing]         the reader in relation to the various levels of enunciation in the text--reader,         speaker, subject, author--though with manipulative utilization of the         strategies of graphic design. Such inscription, obvious marking, of the         assumed reader, forces language into the public domain" (97).       <P align=justify><I>The Visible Word</I> closes with a discussion of the         demise of typographic experimentation, as the unruly incursions of language         into public domain are transformed by the "efficient" and "modern," which         is to say uniformist, principles of graphic design into contained, unified         markers of corporate identity and packaging.       <BLOCKQUOTE>        <!--_extract-->        The devices so conspicuously laid bare in the experimental work of the         (albeit politically disparate) early twentieth-century artists became,         within two decades, the most efficient means of concealing not only the         marks of artistic and literary enunciation, but of the structures of economic         power in corporate, state, and military production as well . . . [245].        <!--_/extract-->      </BLOCKQUOTE>      <P align=justify>Drucker's passionate presentation of work too often overlooked         and her brilliant critique of the critical domestication of modernist         practice make <I>The Visible Word</I> crucial not just for our understanding         of the historical avant-garde but also for understanding what poetry is         and how it means.       <P align=right>        <!--_reviewername-->        Charles Bernstein         <!--_/reviewername-->        <BR>        <!--_affiliation-->        <I>State University of New York, Buffalo</I>         <!--_/affiliation-->      <P>&nbsp;       </FONT></TD>    <TD width="5%">&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
