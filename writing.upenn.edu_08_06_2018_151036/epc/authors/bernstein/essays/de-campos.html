      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Haroldo de Campos 
        is a defining figure for the poetry of the Americas. His work is essential 
        not just to an understanding of Brazilian poetry but also to the geography 
        -- conceptual, intellectual, cultural, and social -- of postwar poetry 
        in the world at large. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say -- 
        the world at small, for de Campos is determinately peripheral 
        to the large-scale cultural and economic forces that have, more often 
        than not, wrecked havoc on the possibilities for poetry’s indomitable 
        sprit as local, resistant, rebarbative, intractable, radiant; as infra- 
        and cross-cultural rather than pan-cultural; as intellectual fire rather 
        than sentimental noise.</i></font></p>
      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Haroldo de Campos 
        died on August 16, 2003, at the age of 73, just months before a planned 
        trip to the U.S. However, he was able to see the manuscript of Novas, 
        a selection of his poems and essays, edited by A. S. Bessa and Odile 
        Cisneros, which is forthcoming from Northwestern University Press. </font></i></p>
      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On January 12, 2002, 
        Bessa and Pablo <span class=eudoraheader>Helguera </span>brought a group 
        of us together at the Guggenheim Museum, which was then presenting its 
        gigantic show of art from Brazil, to talk about de Campos’s work. The 
        following remarks are adapted from that talk.</font></i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font></p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">De Campos is best known 
      as one of the inventors of Concrete poetry in the 1950s. But concrete, or 
      visual, poetry is only one aspect of de Campos’s work and his identification 
      with this movement may obscure his overall achievement. The dynamic of this 
      overshadowing, however, is a central part of the social meaning of his work. 
      De Campos wrote literary and political essays, which often appeared in São 
      Paulo’s daily newspapers. He also created poems in many new and old forms, 
      including abstract lyrics (resembling in some ways the early work of Clark 
      Coolidge, such as that collected in <i>Space</i>) and a new form of prose 
      poetry that he called <i>Galáxias</i>, which is characterized by the pervasive 
      use of portmanteau words (along the lines of late Joyce) and absence of 
      periods, and is possibly his greatest literary achievement. Yet perhaps 
      de Campos’s most resonant work was his writing about, and his practice of, 
      translation, what he called <i>transcreation</i>. Indeed, the poetics and 
      politics of trans- and re-creation informs not just de Campos’s incredible 
      range of translations into Portuguese -- <i>Genesis</i> and <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, 
      Homer and Dante, Joyce and Pound, Mallarmé and Mayakovsky --  but his work 
      overall. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">De Campos believed 
        that translation was a key issue for Brazilian modernism. And Brazil itself 
        is a necessary starting point for consideration of de Campos as poet and 
        transcreator. I approach this topic with both enthusiasm and trepidation, 
        for what I know about Brazil is determined, to a great extent, by what 
        has been exported; indeed, what’s available to me in translation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The problem is translating 
        de Campos without losing the Brazilian.  According to de Campos, the literary 
        work in Brazil starts full-blown with the Baroque and you can experience 
        this in a very striking way at the Guggenheim show. After ascending through 
        floors and floors of Baroque art, all of a sudden you end up in a display 
        of formalist modernism. There is practically no transition. Speaking today 
        amidst this profusion of Brazilian art, we can see that de Campos is both 
        Baroque and anti-Baroque.  For de Campos, however, it is perhaps more 
        cogent to speak of polyglotism, or what might also be called the syncretic. 
        Indeed, the tensions among the polyglot<b>,</b> the multilingual, and 
        the syncretic is a manifestation of the overlay of a reductive yet elegant 
        modernist formalism superimposed on a Baroque foundation. And indeed this 
        is the back story of de Campos’s poetry. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the Guggenheim, 
        such cultural contradictions were displayed in the most dramatic way in 
        the conflict between the Norman Rockwell show, in the new side wing of 
        the museum, and the Brazil show in the main atrium.  The Rockwell show 
        suggests a vision of America which is opposite to the syncretic and polyglot: 
        an art of America not the Americas. Rockwell is constantly reiterating 
        a unified and idealized image of what American (United States) culture 
        can be; looking at these images brings this America into being.  On the 
        Brazilian side, there is no similar singular image of national unity. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first book of 
        poetry published by a Brazilian author was <i>Música do Parnasso</i> by 
        Manuel Botelho de Oliveira (1636-1671); it was written in four languages -- Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, and Latin.  If one reads that book as 
        a virtual ground for de Campos’s project, it puts into play a very different 
        framework than for those of his North and South American contemporaries 
        who conceive of poetry as monolingual. But de Campos’s polylingualism 
        is not simply a measure of his internationalism -- for both the apparent 
        extroverted internationalism of Concrete poetry and of transcreation has 
        another, intensely introverted, dimension, which is a crucial dynamic 
        of de Campos’s work.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the Brazilian 
        modernism of the early 1920s, there was a focus on the specificity of 
        Brazil but also on the fact that Brazil -- its culture, its art -- was 
        unknown to the outside world.  And at this point a fundamental conflict 
        emerges between exporting and refusing to export “Brazil.” The fear of 
        exporting culture is that one may end up extracting, reducing, translating 
        (away),  sacrificing the heart for a hollow representation. Moreover, 
        there is the sense that one must <i>have</i> a culture in order to be 
        in dialogue with other cultures; so, first, there is the need to build 
        your culture into something substantial. Dialogue, in other words, export, 
        comes into conflict with self-development<b>.  </b>Or put it this way: 
        Internationalism comes into conflict with willed isolation, the insistence 
        on cultural solitude, which necessarily entails remaining unknown to the 
        outside world.  This issue, so central for de Campos, and other Brazilian 
        poets, was addressed, in the 1920s, by the Brazilian poet Oswald de Andrade 
        (1890-1954), when he writes of anthropophagy or cannibalism. Cannibalism 
        is a way to deal with that which is external. While related to both translation 
        and assimilation, cannibalism goes further: by eating that which is outside, 
        ingesting it so that it becomes a part of you, it ceases to be external.  
        By digesting, you absorb.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1952, when he 
        was twenty-three years old, de Campos co-founded the Concrete poetry movement, 
        the most visible Brazilian international literary export up until that 
        time, and, as a result, also very well known, even if initially controversial, 
        inside Brazil. Simultaneously, he was writing neo-Baroque poems, poems 
        that remain unknown outside Brazil. Concrete poetry was a successful Brazilian 
        export: it became part of, insofar as it could be assimilated to, the 
        international modernist style. You can look at a Concrete poem and get 
        the sense you understand it, without knowing Portuguese or anything about 
        Brazil, or indeed anything about the author. The design of the words on 
        the page, the evident lyric wit, made de Campos’s Concrete poems tremendously 
        appealing. In its initial guise of minimalist reduction, these poems look 
        international, suggesting a utopian possibility for postwar literary modernism, 
        connected, for example, with both the architectural style and left politics 
        of Oscar Niemeyer. The fact that a radically experimental visual poetry 
        has been Brazil’s best-known poetry export, and as a result achieved a 
        significant measure of acceptance within Brazil, reverses the dynamic 
        in almost all other places, where comparable forms of innovative poetry 
        work have been the among the most marginalized. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The situation of 
        Concrete poetry echoes the double-bind of Russian Futurist Velimir Khlebnikov’s 
        <i>zaum</i> (transrational) poetry. On the one hand, <i>zaum</i> was able 
        to transcend language barriers, as a kind of Esperanto.  Everyone would 
        be able to understand transense or made-up words because nobody could 
        understand them. In other words, like Concrete poetry, it appears to needs 
        no translation. On the other hand, in its materializing of the word, zaum 
        is completely opaque: untranslatable. It is this other side of the coin 
        that is related to de Campos’s turn from his earlier sleek international 
        modernism to Baroque transcreation, as he moved toward a capacious opacity 
        by a process of absorption and cannibalization. Within the light of de 
        Campos’s subsequent work, his Concrete poetry takes on a double life, 
        for its very lucidity is the surface reflection of its refractory, ludic 
        otherness; it’s like the sun shining on the surface of a body of water 
        whose depth has not yet been sounded.  Indeed, in many of de Campos’s 
        poems, an immediately appealing play of sound, on the order of sound poetry 
        for the non-Portuguese-speaking listener, doubles with a semantic complexity 
        unavailable in the sounds themselves. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In other words, I 
        keep coming back to that phrase, <i>in other words</i> we have to translate 
        even, especially, de Campos’s translations. The words alone are not enough, 
        what is required is an act of cultural transcreation and poetic exchange. 
        If I were to situate de Campos within an American poetry context, the 
        contemporaries of his that would come to mind immediately would be Robert 
        Creeley, Jackson Mac Low, Susan Howe, Jerome Rothenberg, and David Antin. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In considering Brazil’s 
        export culture, among the best known work is the bossa nova, as created 
        in the magnificent rhythmic asymmetries and lyric understatement of Antonio 
        Carlos Jobim (1925-1994) and Vinicius de Moraes (1913-1980), both roughly 
        contemporary with de Campos, and continuing on with what has come to be 
        called MPB (<i>Música Popular Brasileira</i>). Indeed, de Campos’s movement 
        away from assimilatable export, as he backed away from the window onto 
        (or out of?) Brazil provided by international abstraction, might be contrasted 
        to the <em>Tropicalismo</em> of that most gifted singer/songwriter/poet 
        Caetano Veloso (born in 1942), who has achieved a phenomenal international 
        success over the past two decades. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Haroldo’s brother, 
        and fellow Concrete poet, Augusto de Campos created a small storm among 
        Brazil’s innovative poets by once suggesting the <em>Tropicalismo<span
style='font-style:normal'> was more interesting than any of their work. I don’t 
        know what Haroldo thought of this, but I read his approach as being quite 
        different. </span></em>For Haroldo, the 1950s crystallized a moment of 
        political possibility, of utopian extroversion; after that, he turned 
        toward a non-utopian grappling with social complexity -- what he called 
        &quot;sign materialism.&quot;  Sign materialism provides a way to read 
        his journey from Concrete poetry to linguistic concretion by means of 
        transcreation. Translation then becomes a bridge, going back to his earliest 
        work and drawing on his interest in Pound’s, Zukofsky’s, and Benjamin’s 
        radical approaches to translation.  What de Campos calls transcreation 
        is, in effect, <i>re-creation</i>: in translating the poet (cannibalistically) 
        creates an original work in his or her own right, one no longer beholding 
        to the source.   </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thinking of this 
        in terms of dependency, and in terms of Brazil, trancreation/re-creation 
        becomes a metaphor for refusing dependency. The poet resists exporting; 
        resists, that is, becoming dependent on what’s exportable. At the same 
        time, the poet resists importing; resists, that is, developing a subsidiary 
        relation to the powerful literatures beyond. Trancreation is a means of 
        appropriating and remaking in one’s own right.  In the process, the work 
        made becomes refractory, opaque.  It must itself be translated and yet 
        it can’t be translated. De Campos’s translations are not subsidiary or 
        secondary to some original but have themselves become original work.  
        De Campos’s elaborations and extensions around a shifting center are the 
        Baroque element of his work, with its insistence on the materiality of 
        its languages and holding to its own specific gravity.  It comes to this: 
        de Campos’s work resists translatability through its cultural and linguistic 
        thickness. In this way, de Campos reverses any reductive understanding 
        of his internationalism. The work exemplifies what de Campos calls <i>concretion</i>, 
        in contradistinction to &quot;concrete&quot;:  a neo-Baroque complexity 
        that stands with its back askew to the internationally absorbable simplification 
        represented by his best-known work, his primary export item, &quot;Concrete 
        Poetry.&quot;  The work of de Campos is a dream of and by translation, 
        but with no bottom language. </font></p>
