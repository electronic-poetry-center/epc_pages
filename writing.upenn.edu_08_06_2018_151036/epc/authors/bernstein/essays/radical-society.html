      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In January 2002, Joshua Beckman, 
        an editor of <i>Radical Society</i>, asked several people to respond to 
        this quote from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We've just seen in Afghanistan 
              one way of getting a state out of the business of supporting terrorism. 
              The better way is for states to decide voluntarily that this is 
              not a good business to be in, and to look at what's happened to 
              the Taliban and say wait a minute, I don't want that to happen to 
              me. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We in the Department 
              of Defense, frankly, are not looking for extra work. We would much 
              prefer that all those countries that have been supporting terrorism 
              in the past would reconsider what they're doing and end state support 
              for terrorism because it is I think clearly an evil that's gone 
              from being just one of those bad things that happens in the world 
              to being something that's truly intolerable.<br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Politics might still be a 
        way of articulating values rather than obliterating thought, but we rarely 
        see any evidence of this from the official spokespersons of the state. 
        Even those most inclined to reject the language of State department briefings 
        are more than likely to focus on the supposed content, as if there were 
        one. It would be insufferably pedantic to constantly critique the language 
        of state business, except in the comic mode of the presumed incontinence 
        in the verbatim utterance of the two Bushes. These are attributed to defect 
        rather than policy, and any talk of what we used to call in the sixties 
        &quot;smoke screens&quot; now seems decidedly retro. Recent research on 
        smoke screens has come up with a scientifically accurate &quot;spf&quot; 
        rating - surreptitious policy factor. The quote at hand registered 64, 
        though they say anything over 32 is effective enough. My brief text scores 
        133 and counting. I am not, that is, advocating greater clarity or transparency, 
        which are the most common tools of deceit in the game. In this particular 
        case, the smoke may be hiding a policy that is not as bad as expressed. 
        But maybe the danger would be that if the policy was articulated in terms 
        of its values, then we would feel more compelled to follow its implications 
        and applications. This might have an inhibitory effect on the unilateral 
        actions we launch abroad. Moreover, holding people accountable for their 
        words might also be the best defense against what I guess we can now call 
        the Wolfowitz doctrine, which differentiates intolerable evil from the 
        evils we choose to tolerate. I use the term &quot;we&quot; loosely.</font></p>

        We in the Department of Poetry, frankly, are not looking for extra work. 
        We would much prefer that all those speaking for the people would reconsider 
        what they're saying. Truly we do. <br>
