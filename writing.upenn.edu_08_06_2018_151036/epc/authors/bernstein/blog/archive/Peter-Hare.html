H. Hare<br>
</font></b>(1935-2008) <br>
<br>
<img src="../images/Hare-Peter.jpg"><br>
</span><span class="rss-content"><br>
Peter H. Hare, philosopher and educator, Distinguished Service
Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University at Buffalo,
State University of New York, died peacefully in his sleep in
the early morning hours of Thursday, January 3, 2008 at his home
in Guilford, Connecticut. Born in New York City on March 12,
1935, son of the late Jane Perry and Michael Meredith Hare, Peter
is survived by his second wife, the poet Susan Howe, a brother
Michael, a sister Sarah, his son Clare, daughter Gwen, and grandchildren
Danielle and Monty, and numerous friends and students. His first
wife Daphne Hare preceded him in death in 1995.</span>
<p><span class="rss-content">While an undergraduate at Yale University,
Peter Hare began his life-long relationship with philosophy,
writing a thesis on Alfred North Whitehead as an exemplar of
multi-disciplinary integration. After graduating from Yale, he
earned his Ph.D. in philosophy at Columbia University where he
wrote a dissertation on G. H. Mead&rsquo;s metaphysics.</span></p>
<p><span class="rss-content">At the age of 36, Dr. Hare was appointed Full Professor and
Chair of the Philosophy Department of the State University of
New York at Buffalo. His experience working with a heterogeneous
group of Marxists, logicians, linguists, and Americanists inspired
him to continue the work of bringing together disparate strands
of 20th century thought into a unified vision of a modern philosophy
department.</span></p>
<p><span class="rss-content">Through his own writings and teachings, Hare left an indelible
impact upon the history of American philosophy, helping to draw
the works of C.S. Peirce, G. H. Mead, William James, A. N. Whitehead,
and John Dewey into international centrality. As a committed
educator, editor, and participant in professional organizations,
he never ceased in the work of bringing together disparate stands
of philosophy, literature, poetry and art. He was an accomplished
photographer, and at his death he was at work photographing the
Central Park neighborhood of Buffalo for a publication about
the architecture of that area. Many of his works hang on view
at the Philosophy Department where he taught for so many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="rss-content">Dr. Hare traveled widely in the service of philosophy. Among
other posts, he served as President of the New York State Philosophy
Association, the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy,
the Charles Sanders Peirce Society, and the William James Society.
He was the recipient of numerous awards and honors for distinguished
contributions to the understanding and development of the rich
diversity of the American tradition. Since the early 1970s he
was co-editor of the <i>Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society:
A Quarterly Journal in American Philosophy. </i>He was editor
or co-editor of numerous volumes, and he was author of more than
one hundred articles in scholarly journals.</span></p>
<p><span class="rss-content">A man of abiding pragmatism, optimism, kindness, enthusiasm,
generosity and energy, Dr. Hare will be remembered by students,
philosophers, and people of every walk of life, from Poland and
Russia, to South America to Buffalo.</span></p>
