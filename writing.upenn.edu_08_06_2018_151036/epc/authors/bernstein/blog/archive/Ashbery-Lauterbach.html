<b>John Ashbery Introduction<br>
15 September 2007<br>
</b><i> at &quot;That Feeling of Exultation&quot;<br>
Bard&rsquo;s
celebration of Ashbery&rsquo;s
eightieth Birthday</i>
</center>


<p align="left"> When John Ashbery&rsquo;s great friend and partner David
Kermani and I began to talk about this weekend&rsquo;s celebration,
we imagined a forum of activities that would animate the myriad
ways in which Ashbery&rsquo;s work is connected to the other
arts and artists of our time. Indeed, if you consult the on-line
Ashbery Resource Center, you will find an astonishing matrix
of such connections: to literature, music, visual arts, cinema,
television, radio and animation, theatre, dance, opera. Scratch
the surface, you will find everyone from Daffy Duck to Joseph
Cornell to Elliott Carter--- the list is, literally, endless.
To do this variousness justice, we would have needed not one,
but ten weekends. Think of this as a beginning, a touchstone. </p>
<p align="left"> The title for today&rsquo;s festivities was taken from one
of my favorite Ashbery poems, &ldquo;A Blessing in Disguise&rdquo;,
from <i>Rivers and Mountains</i>. To have a favorite Ashbery poem is
a little like having a favorite strawberry, or rose, or word.
But one does have favorites, based, like many favorite things,
on long-term familiarity. One turns and returns to certain poems,
and certain lines within those poems: &ldquo; and then I start
getting this feeling of exaltation.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"> This feeling of exaltation is certainly what I got when I
first heard John Ashbery read, in London, in 1971. His appearance
there was the culminating event in a series on contemporary French,
Eastern European and American poetry I had organized as curator
of literary events at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. </p>
<p align="left"> After his reading. I approached him with baffled enthusiasm
and declared, &ldquo;O Mr. Ashbery, I love clich&eacute;s!&rdquo; He
looked at me and, with an expression of slightly bemused interest,
replied, &ldquo;And they love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"> As his American English hostess, I got to hang out with him.
We went shopping for a velvet jacket on Carnaby Street. I hailed
him a cab after a day at the home of poet Anthony Howell, on
Hampstead Heath, and I remember saying to the Cockney cabbie: &ldquo;The
Ritz Hotel. And take good care of him, he is America&rsquo;s
greatest living poet.&rdquo; One night he read aloud to a small
group of us in his hotel room. He had just finished the three
long prose pieces that make up <i>Three Poems</i>. Imagine yourself
a young ex-patriot aspiring poet in a sea of Sylvia Plathian
intensities hearing these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
&ldquo;I thought that if I could
put it all down, that would be one way. And next the thought
came to me that to leave all out would be another, and truer
way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clean washed sea <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The flowers were. 
<br>
<br>
These are examples of leaving out. But, forget
as we will, something soon comes to stand in their place. Not
the truth, perhaps, but ---yourself. It is you who made this,
therefore you are true. But the truth has passed on <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
divide all.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>This feeling of exaltation is what came
upon those of us who heard him read his poems then, and to those
who hear or read them now. Amazing, when you think of it: beginning
in 1953 with a chapbook, <i>Turandot and Other Poems</i> and moving
through twenty-five collections to his most recent, the somber
and beautiful <i>A Worldy Country</i>. At nearly every page along the
way, we have been invited to re-imagine what a poem is, to listen
in a new way.</p>
<p align="left"> This newness shifted the ground on which a poem might be
resting. Indeed, the separation of figure from ground in an Ashbery
poem is all but dissolved; things seem to happen in a fluid solution,
as if always on the way to or from a destination that is itself
simultaneously approaching and receding. Observations, revelations,
ideas, encounters, and objects course through in such a way as
to suggest there is nothing to know outside of the poem. This
replete, mutating experience is carried along on the most elastic
yet taut syntax; and, because nothing stays in focus for long,
the notion of a poem as high-resolution picture, or story, or
memo to live by, gives way to the poem as a condition, a habitat,
a surround. </p>
<p align="left"> Between the high detail of the foreground and the abstract
distance of the horizon, the reader is invited in. One can take
one&rsquo;s stuff; it is quite roomy. It is the space, say, of
a city square, an open market, a corner bodega, a hotel lobby.
Here we greet each other, exchange information and opinion, but
because we are on our way elsewhere, a certain civility prevails;
we do not intrude, or impose. The diction is one of mild, good-natured
inquiry and response; a demotic grace and graciousness prevails,
invariably punctuated by mishearings, odd juxtapositions, the
marvelous, sometimes sad and often funny enjambments and eruptions
of actual life.</p>
<p align="left"> Ashbery&rsquo;s work has been central to our major critical
thinkers, from Harold Bloom&rsquo;s track of the American sublime
to Marjorie Perloff&rsquo;s poetics of indeterminacy; recently,
it provided the central example for Angus Fletcher&rsquo;s <i>A
New Theory for American Poetry</i>. Above all, as this weekend&rsquo;s
poets have so exuberantly demonstrated, John Ashbery has given
seminal inspiration and nourishment, across the generations,
to an extraordinary range of poetic energies. </p>
<p align="left"> To make poetry from the place of the commons, the middle
distance, is to remind us of ourselves in relation to each other;
that is, of our unique human engagement with language as a key
to our various and particular reciprocities. To enter an Ashbery
poem is to find oneself oddly consoled, at ease, within the deepest
boundaries of reception. It is the space of an ideal real: everything
is noticed, everyone is included: </p>
<p align="left"> &ldquo;I prefer you in the plural, I want you, <br>
You must come
to me, all golden and pale <br>
Like the dew and the air. <br>
And then I start getting this feeling
of exaltation.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="left">Ladies and gentlemen.<br>
Please welcome
John Ashbery </p>
