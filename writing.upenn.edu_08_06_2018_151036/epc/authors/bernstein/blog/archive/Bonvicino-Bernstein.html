<p>Dear Charles,</p>
<p>Obama is the &quot;beyond&quot; for U.S. He will give a &quot;public
dimension&quot; to the U.S. government, away from Bush&rsquo;s
treating&nbsp;  the government as a private state. If Obama is
elected, it will be welcomed in Latin America, Africa, and the
Islamic World. W. Bush is maybe the worst president the U.S.
has ever had. The state in the hands of the companies. The war.
The&nbsp; torture. He is just like our Brazilian dictators or
Pinochet or Idi Amim Dada. Obama means JFK, Bobby Kennedy, Martin
Luther King. <br>
<br>
The U.S. election in November is the most important election
of the last decades for the world. An Obama victory will be crucial
for Latin America in recovering the dialogue with the U.S. and
so bye, bye Ch&aacute;vez, Ortega, &Aacute;lvaro Uribe, Cristina
Fern&aacute;ndez (a thief just like Menen was). I can't see future
without true democracy in the U.S. and Obama. </p>
<p>Tell me please what do you think about Palin?</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>R&eacute;gis</p>
<hr>
<p><b>New York, September 6, 2008</b></p>
<p>Dear R&eacute;gis,<br>
<br>
During the Vietnam war (which for the Vietnamese was an act of
American terrorism), John McCain was shot down as an enemy combatant.
He was not given a fair trail and was subjected to torture. When
Sarah Palin, in endorsing McCain, expressed her contempt for
the rule of law, in a line that will live in&nbsp; infamy&nbsp; <strong>-- &quot;</strong>Al
Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America
... [Obama's] worried that someone won't read them their rights?&quot;--
she forever tainted any honor that McCain's war experiences might
reflect on her or her party.<br>
<br>
Palin-McCain show the Republicans to be <i>the&nbsp; party of
irresponsibility</i>, refusing to acknowledge the consequences
of their policies: unjustified wars; torture; global warming;
abrogation of civil liberties; unemployment; erosion of even
modest economic and medical safety nets; big business control
of government regulation of their industries; environmental degradation;
bloated prisons filled with those whose principal crime is being
born poor, black, and male; erosion of the urban infrastructure;
decline of public education (every child left behind); putsch-like
transformation of the Justice department and courts into anti-democratic
and extra-constitutional hit squads coked up by their contempt
for the rule of law; increased number of unwanted pregnancies
and abortions (both U.S. and worldwide); compromised worker safety
and worker wages; unprecedented mortgage defaults; and catastrophic
shift of wealth from working class and middle class to a tiny
plutocracy.<br>
<br>
The culture of irresponsibility and contempt for the civil liberties
enshrined in the U.S. constitution extends out from Republican
politicians to those who have voted for the Republican Party
in the last two presidential elections. I blame the voters --
for falling prey to their own resentments and racisms, their
homophobia, and intolerance. In 2000, to vote for Cheney-Bush
was to cast your lot with dark side of human history. <br>
<br>
You ask what I think about Palin: She is a sinister figure for
the U.S. -- a right wing pit bull (her own description for herself)
who is at core against America's most democratic and socially
optimistic values. We hear too many commentaries in the mediocracy
praise the &quot;style&quot; of her speech, but my teenage son
Felix got it just right when he said, simply, that &quot;she's
mean.&quot;&nbsp; The core of that meanness is related to the
Republican party's deification of intolerance and worship of <i>resentiment</i>.
You could hear it in Rudolph Guiliani's smarmy put down of &quot;cosmopolitans,&quot; normally
a code word for rootless Jews and girly men but here used to
sneer at all who reject fear mongering -- as if Christian fundamentalist
intolerance is the answer to Islamic fundamentalist intolerance. <br>
<br>
Palin is the case book example of Republican party's bait &amp; switch,
the party's most typical modus operandi: a woman candidate who
is anti-feminist and opposed the most basic issues of civil rights
for women, on the order of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas
as an anti-civil-rights black man. Palin represents a continuation
of the totalitarian aspects of Bush-Cheney by a party determined
to sustain those calamitous policies for four more years and
by any means necessary (including rigged elections and disinformation). <br>
<br>
Palin is a jingoist nationalist, a proud &quot;no nothing&quot; on
foreign affairs. She'd insist that the State force teenagers
to study her religious beliefs on the creation of the world,
and, at the same time, that the State prevent teenagers from
learning about human procreation so that they will have the knowledge
to act responsibly in the world. Palin would undercut science
classes by imposing a state religion of her choice, in this case
a rabid fundamentalism (not to be equated with Christianity),
but she would deny freedom of choice to those who don't swing
her way. In the guise of Big Brother abstinence-only &quot;no
sex&quot; (mis)eduction for teens, Palin is responsible for the
abortions and teen pregnancies that result. But she refuses to
accept the blame. In a similar vein, McCain, who voted for an
unjustifiable war, and even now has not renounced his vote, refuses
to accept the fact that he is personally responsible for the
horrific consequences of that war. <br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>

<p>Dear Charles,</p>
<p>Your letter is very strong and crucial<strong>.</strong> But
tell me what you think of Barack Obama's plans. What does <i>change </i>mean?
Who is he? Does he have content? How do you refute the Republican
line that he is a celebrity and not a politician
with ideas? It&rsquo;s not that I think this, but I have listened
in S&atilde;o Paulo to upper middle class people say that he
is a fool! You know, Brazilians are more racist than Americans.
But the black people from Rio's favelas love Obama<b>, </b>their
new hero<b>.</b> They call him &quot;O bamba&quot; --
homophonic translations of Obama, that means in slang tough guy,
bully, hood -- the best, the one. This word came from samba,
from Nigeria Bantu I think. There is a classic song by Ataulfo
Alves called &quot;Na cad&ecirc;ncia do samba&quot;:  &quot;Quero
morrer numa batucada de bamba / na cad&ecirc;ncia bonita do samba&quot;:  &ldquo;I
wanna die in the beat of &lsquo;bamba&rsquo; / in the beautiful
rhythm of the samba.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is my essay on the election
from yesterd<i>ay's &Uacute;ltimo Segundo</i> ay&rsquo;s(the
S&atilde;o
Paulo daily newspaper):<br>
<b><i>[translation by Odile Cisneros; <a href="http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/mundo/2008/09/06/em_defesa_da_poesia_1688025.html">Portuguese

<b><font size="+1">A Defence of Poetry <br />
R&eacute;gis Bonvicino</font></b>
</p>
</font></b>
</center>
<p>Antonio Ca&ntilde;o, a Washington correspondent for <em>El
Pa&iacute;s</em>, recovering a concept coined by the Italian
writer and film maker, Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1975), recently proposed Barack
Obama as poetry and John McCain as prose, realist prose. Some
time later, John Ludenberg, from the American portal <em>Huffington
Post</em>, unwittingly echoed Ca&ntilde;o when analyzing Obama's
acceptance address at the Democratic Convention called it &quot;the
poetry of a political speech.&quot; And he explains that although
poetry itself wasn't actually present in all the passages, it
nonetheless emerges in the rhythm. Ludenberg notes he does not
speak in metrical verse, bur rather in biblical cadences, like
Martin Luther King (1929-1968) or Walt Whitman's (1829-1892)
long verses. Whitman was the inventor of free verse and the first
American poet who openly addressed his homosexuality in <em>Leaves
of Grass </em>&nbsp;(1855), whose first edition, financed by
the author, had 95 pages and 12 poems. Ludenberg argues that
the repetition of words in the opening of phrases likens Obama's
speech to poetry.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	War-shington</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obama's
speeches are not poetry nor are McCain's &quot;prose&quot;, and
Obama does not represent the poetry nor McCain a certain type
of prose&mdash;the prose of, for instance, Oswald de Andrade
(1890-1954). The comparisons reveal the ignorance of the contemporary
world and the media when it comes to poetry. To be a poet, in
such terms, is to be a delirious dreamer, someone who proposes
quixotic ideas, one who is outside of reality. Although on a
different scale, the same prejudice exists in relation to prose.
Prose means wordiness, someone who talks too much and says nothing.
Still, prose seems more adequate as a way to characterize both
candidates, or any politician, for that matter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pasolini,
the brilliant author of <em>Mamma Roma</em> (1963), &quot;invented,&quot; in
an essay from 1975, the notion that in soccer there's a prosaic
and a poetic language. He argued that dribbling and individual
play were essentially poetry, while defensive and triangular
play were prosaic. In his view, prose-soccer was based on syntax,
on a collective and organized game, synthesized into a system,
while poetry-soccer, which he associated with the Brazilian team
in 1970, with Pel&eacute; and Tost&atilde;o, would be the unexpected,
the strange and the unforeseen. The definition was reasonably
correct (when it came to the unexpected), both for poetry as
for soccer. It is partially correct because there's no inspiration
without work and, mainly, without order. And, in many occasions,
just as in 1970, the victory was poetry's. Language has certain
functions, and the poetic function is one of them, just as the
referential function used by the media, whose aim is to disseminate
information privileging the facts about the object in the news
and not&mdash;as is the case of poetry or artistic prose&mdash;language
itself, its sounds, its rhythms, its unusual meanings. Prose-soccer
would be effective, and poetry-soccer would be individualistic
and &quot;inspired,&quot; according to Pasolini. Hence, for Ca&ntilde;o,
Obama would be &quot;inspired,&quot; when he proposed changes,
and McCain would represent an effective system lacking  &quot;magic,&quot; in
his reiteration of the Republican program. The two represent,
I believe, only and exclusively prose, because they aim at arriving
in &quot;War-shington&quot; in January 2009. I quote below a
passage from the poem &quot;A Bomba&quot; (1961, &quot;The Bomb&quot;)
by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, so the reader may have a clear
idea what great poetry is like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
bomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twists
all languages into its cloudy syntax<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
bomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; belches
imposture and political prosopopoiea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
bomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breeds
leopards in the backyard, sometimes in the living room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
bomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is
rotten<br />
<font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/library/Drummond-The-Bomb.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [see
translation of the whole poem at the PEPC library]</a> <br />
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prosopoeia
means a bombastic or vehement speech and is a figure of speech
whereby the speaker attributes human feelings to inanimate beings,
to animals or to dead people, for instance. In the poem, Drummond
uses the word in the sense of bombast but also of insul<strong>t</strong>.
For instance, when George Walker Bush, McCain, and Sarah Palin
defend war. He also used it in the sense of prosopopoeia as well:
pro-war politicians  &quot;speak&quot; of&nbsp; the dead. Palin
accused Obama of not using the word &quot;victory&quot; when
he talked about the Iraq War. This is the war-mongering, irrational
populism of Republicans: in 2003, Obama voted in Congress against
the invasion of Iraq. In this case, he behaved like essayistic,
analytic, and reflexive prose. Obama's proposals are rational
prose: to cut taxes by 95% for workers, to cut taxes for small
businesses and to increase them for big business, to invest in
education, in renewable energy, in research against global warming,
to reestablish civil rights erased by Bush, to restore dialogue
with other countries, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erosion
of Rights</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes
Obama is also common prose: when he acknowledges unilateral interventions
in countries that shelter terrorists, as in his book <em>The
Audacity of Hope</em> (2006). McCain is now an imitator of Obama
when he preaches &quot;changes&quot; to will the election and
leaving Hitlerian prose to Sarah Palin, who is against abortion
even in the case of rape (Brazilian law, for instance, allows
this), against any initiative against global warming, which was
not, in her opinion, created by man but by the will of God, against
the killing of polar bears, in favor of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, etc. McCain is fraudulent prose when he promises
to cut taxes for the rich even further and to &quot;prepare American
workers to compete in a world economy.&quot; McCain is Hollywood-style
prose when he repeats, about the terrorists, &quot;Wanted&mdash;dead
or alive.&quot; He himself suffers from skin cancer and could
be transformed into a &quot;prosopopoeia&quot; in a speech by
President Palin. It is probable that the McCain/Palin ticket
will win the U.S. election. From 1945 on, the Republican Party
has been in power for 36 years compared to the 23 years in power
of the Democrats, and among Democrats, only Jimmy Carter (1974-1977)
was a true social democrat. Lyndon Johnson (1963-1969) was a
right-leaning Democrat. John F. Kennedy (1961-1963) is, even
today, more the myth than a progressive. Harry Truman (1945-1963)
was a more right-leaning Democrat than Johnson.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No
politician is comparable to poetry, although Obama's dreams,
as Ca&ntilde;o rightly defined them, are more than necessary.
In the end, politicians too shall pass, even though their damage
lasts for decades, and poetry remains. Who can remember who the
president was during Fernando Pessoa's time? One must criticize,
vigorously, the fall of the level of civilization, which originated
in Europe, and the erosion of civil and workers' rights that
happened in the countries of the &quot;Free World&quot;  starting
in the 1990s. One must denounce mafia states such as Russia and
its appendix South Ossetia, and others, which emerged form the
debacle in 1991 of the deplorable Soviet Union. One must denounce
slave labor in Hu Jintao's China. The United States would have
a decisive civilizing role in this beginning of the century,
but there politicians overwhelmingly, deserve&mdash;and I hope
Barack Obama will be the exception Carter was&mdash;the contempt
Plato felt for them.</p>

Change for the Worse</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>New York, September 9, 2008</b></p>
<p>Dear R&eacute;gis,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that both McCain and Obama are &ldquo;prose,&rdquo; which
is as it should be. But it&rsquo;s interesting, in this light,
to consider what it means that Obama is attacked as if he were
poetry, where poetry means fluffy rhetoric that sounds good but &hellip; don&rsquo;t
amount to nothing! Just more elitist crap! &ndash;You don&rsquo;t
need Wallace Stevens to tell you that the imagination is the
most democratic thing of all. George Lakoff has been saying that
the Republicans understand the election is won by metaphors not
facts, that voters respond to the world view they idealize (discipline
and punish for the Republicans, contextualize and ameliorate
for&nbsp;  the Democrats). Unlike the Republicans, though, the
Democrats are uncomfortable with running just on metaphor, which
is all to the good, but not if it becomes a trap of the &ldquo;When
will you stop beating your wife?&rdquo; sort, which can&rsquo;t
be answered by facts without making you look like you did something
wrong. &ldquo;I love my wife, I never laid my hands on her, I
abhor violence against women, I contributed to the local battered
wives shelter, check the police record and&nbsp; you will not
see complaints, ask my neighbors.&rdquo; On all the policy questions &ndash; from
the economy, to taxes, to the war, to the environment, to healthcare
-- the Democratic party platform is better than the Republican
party platform. Obama is a moderate, centrist figure and he will
continually disappointed anyone committed to a more left agenda.
I don&rsquo;t believe he is tacking to the&nbsp;  center because
of the election, I think he was nominated because he&rsquo;s
a centrist. His whole &ldquo;post-partisan&rdquo; rhetoric strikes
me as a neoliberal evasion of ideology and&nbsp; history. But
on the policy questions, he is on the right side of history.
And on the crucial, and probably determining, questions of metaphor
and values, there&rsquo;s no contest.</p>
<p>The irony is that Obama is all content
while the other side is all bait and switch. (You vote to protect
yourself against WMDs and you get a tax holiday for big business.)
The idea that Obama has no &ldquo;substance&rdquo; or  &ldquo;content&rdquo; (too
many ideas not enough action, fancy words no deeds, girly man
that he is) is the Republican imaginary of discipline and punish.
The problem with the Republicans is not that they don&rsquo;t
have content, of course, but that their content is hidden in
endless waves of Big Lies and small lies, disinformation and
bile. The Republicans <i>are</i> the party of audacious change
and after eight years of Cheney-Bush the question is how much
more change of that kind will the American people be willing
to take before turning against the devil <i>inside themselves</i> that
keeps taking the bait and then feeling betrayed. <i>No, they
won&rsquo;t respect you in the morning.</i> And the love child
of this sado-masochistic Republican seduction makes the pods
in the <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers </i>seem kindler and
gentler. </p>
<p>But the sins against the world are
just one&nbsp; part of
the&nbsp;  problem. The sins against the earth cannot be forgiven.<br>

Love,<br>
<br>
