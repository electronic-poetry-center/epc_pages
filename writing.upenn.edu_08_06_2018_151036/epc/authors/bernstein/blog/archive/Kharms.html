I Wrote Nothing: The Selected Writing of Daniil Kharms</a></b></i><br>
ed &amp; tr
Matvei Yaklevich<br>
Woodstock, NY: Overlook Press<br>
<b> 2007</b></p>
<p><font color="#003399">Daniil Kharms, the key figure of second-wave
Russian radical modernism, extends, distorts, and renews the
achievements of Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky, and Blok, not to say
Gogol, in tales, verse, journals, and poet&rsquo;s theater. Kharms&rsquo;s
black comedies of disappearance and metamorphosis are both mystical
and majestic, Dadaist and dazzling. Matvei Yankelevich has done
an heroic job with his translations, selection, and introduction,
bringing this supreme poet of everyday life into English. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF3366"><b>This is a mockery, through and through! Good for nothing!
Bravo!</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><b> Holiday</b></p>
<p align="left"> On the roof of a certain building two draughtsmen sat eating
buckwheat kasha. <br>
<br>
Suddenly one of the draughtsmen shrieked with
joy and took a long handkerchief out of his pocket. He had a
brilliant idea&mdash;he
would tie a twenty-kopeck coin into one end of the handkerchief
and toss the whole thing off the roof down into the street and
see what would come of it. </p>
<p align="left"> The second draughtsman quickly caught on to the first one's
idea. He finished his buckwheat kasha, blew his nose and, having
licked his fingers, got ready to watch the first draughtsman. </p>
<p align="left"> As it happened, both draughtsmen were distracted from the
experiment with the handkerchief and twenty-kopeck coin. On the
roof where both draughtsmen sat an event occurred which could
not have gone unnoticed. </p>
<p align="left"> The janitor Ibrahim was hammering a long stick with a faded
flag into a chimney. </p>
<p align="left"> The draughtsmen asked Ibrahim what it meant, to which Ibrahim
answered: &quot;This means that there's a holiday in the city.&quot; </p>
<p align="left"> &quot;And what holiday would that be, Ibrahim?&quot; asked
the draughtsmen. </p>
<p align="left"> &quot;It's a holiday because our favorite poet composed a
new poem,&quot; said Ibrahim. </p>
<p align="left"> And the draughtsmen, shamed by their ignorance, dissolved
into the air. </p>

<p align="left"><b> Something About Pushkin </b></p>
<p align="left"> It&rsquo;s hard to say something about Pushkin to a person
who doesn&rsquo;t know anything about him. Pushkin is a great
poet. Napoleon is not as great as Pushkin. Bismarck compared
to Pushkin is a nobody. And the Alexanders, First, Second and
Third, are just little kids compared to Pushkin. In fact, compared
to Pushkin, all people are little kids, except Gogol. Compared
to him, Pushkin is is a little kid. </p>
<p align="left"> And so, instead of writing about Pushkin, I would rather
write about Gogol. </p>
<p align="left"> Although, Gogol is so great that not a thing can be written
about him, so I'll write about Pushkin after all. </p>
<p align="left"> Yet, after Gogol, it&rsquo;s a shame to have to write about
Pushkin. But you can&rsquo;t write anything about Gogol. So I&rsquo;d
rather not write anything about anyone. </p>
