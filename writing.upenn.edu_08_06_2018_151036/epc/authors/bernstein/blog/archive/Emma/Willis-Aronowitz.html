<p>I’ve known Emma for more than ten years, but I think of our
time together as two separate eras—pre- and post-GIRLdrive.<br />
<br />
Before winter 2006, our friendship was a rare treat to be enjoyed
at a distance.  We saw each other on special occassions and it
was always carefree, innocent, charmed.  I thought of Emma as
this fascinating combination: part drama queen, part total goofball,
part snappy dresser, part punk, part art…there were many associations.
She spoke in superlatives, like “Omigod, this is actually my
favorite song in the entire world” or “I just seriously had the
worst day of my whole life.”  And I’d have to go, “Really girl? 
Your faaavorite song?  The <em>worst</em> day?” And then she’d
laugh.  The girl knew how to laugh, and how to make fun of herself,
and she really knew how to have a good time.  She was one of
those friends I wouldn’t talk to for months, but then it would
be like no time had passed when we’d finally get together over
6th Street Indian food and a bottle of wine.<br />
<br />
Then everything changed.  In the last couple years we had become,
as I said on our blog, intellectual soulmates.  Through uncannily
parallel experiences, we developed the magic of GIRLdrive off
the tops of our heads one morning.  It was a perfect storm—our
curiosity, our feminism, our restlessness…it all came together,
and we understood each other.  We began to rely on each other
like never before.  We were a delicate balance of rationality
and art, I was Apollo and she was Dionysus.  Emma brought the
rush and the lyricism to the GIRLdrive adventure.  She was breathless
at the sight of the open road, often making me pull over to the
side and pose for a photo.  She was constantly orchestrating
the perfect soundtrack from her endless collection of iPod music,
insisting “trust me, this song goes perfectly with these mountains.” 
Every morning, she put together an awesome outfit from her enormous
suitcase in the back of my Chevy Cavalier.  Although she brought
her characteristic anxiety along for the ride, I could sense
that Emma had never felt more free.  On the trip, and always,
she was exhilarated by new knowledge, a new perspective to wrestle
with, new photographic beauty to feast her eyes on.  We were
experiencing daily revelations together. To have this sort of
connection with someone was just intoxicating.<br />
<br />
Later, it was overwhelming, frightening, even maddening to be
so intertwined in Emma’s daily existence. Her presence had always
filled a room, but lately it had overflowed.  Her pain was palpable,
her anxiety was vibrating. She felt so deeply and so hard, it
became impossible for everyone, including her, to bear.<br />
<br />
In the last couple weeks, it has been hard to look past this
layer of despair, to remember the fun times, and cute anecdotes. 
But once I strip away what happened, there are so many moments
with Emma where she displayed intense, almost euphoric lust for
life—for music, humor, art, food, and love.  One of the fiercest
debates we had recently was whether Radiohead was the most important
band of our generation.  I didn’t give our generation that much
credit; I was cynical about our ability to bond through a common
artwork.  She insisted I was wrong, that their music got inside
people, got inside <em>her</em>, defined her feelings, made sense
of her experience.  I immediately felt a stark difference between
the two of us…I just didn’t see music that way, and I felt shallow
and uncreative and just…lame like why don’t I feel this deeply
or something.  She sighed and told me she knew exaaactly what
I meant (she said that sort of stuff a lot).  This kind of reaction
and affinity to art was a blessing and a curse, she said.  On
one hand it breeds obsession, self-destruction, can be a really
dangerous way to view the world.  But it can also make life worth
living, to see everything through an aesthetic and emotional
lens, to feel each moment like a stab in the heart.  She explained
that in a way, this is where her feminism came from, just the
joy and beauty, but also the pain and complexity of the female
experience.  What happened to her is not romantic…not at all. 
But Emma herself was a hopeless romantic.  She even wrote on
her Myspace wall—I guess proving her Radiohead point—“I wish
it was the sixties, I wish we could be happy.” And Emma could
be ironic, but in this case, I really feel like she meant it.  </p>
