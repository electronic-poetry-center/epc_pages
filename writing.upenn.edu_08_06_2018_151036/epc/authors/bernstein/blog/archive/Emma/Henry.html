<p>My name is Sam Henry. I am greatly honored to have known and
loved
Emma and to speak in her memory today. Emma and I dated and lived
together for over three years during our time at the University
of 
Chicago. We traveled to Europe, were together on holidays, and
supported each other with the sincerest love and care. Over the
past
week and a half, I have been overcome with a flood of the day-to-day
memories that form the foundation of our bond. Days and things
that I
had long forgotten have come back with a newfound, bittersweet,
and
precious meaning. We shared in the trivial and the mundane, confided
and overcame our fears, shared and realized our hopes and dreams,
and
celebrated the good things in life with one another. Although
we were
as children together, Emma and I grew into man and woman and
loved as
husband and wife, father and daughter, mother and son, brother
and
sister, and the greatest of friends.</p>
<p>Although she was always a rebel, sometimes a rebel with pink
or blue
hair, Emma was, deep down, a sentimental traditionalist. She
was prone
to tears—tears that may have been shed in love, in response to
the
latest Olson Twins movie, or, unprompted, by her keen sensation
of the
ultimate sadness of the human world. However, those of us gathered
here today in her memory carry with us a remembrance of Emma's
contagious joy and her love of family, friends, and dance parties.</p>
<p>Emma nourished and fed me and her friends and family with
her
laughter, her smile, her willingness to listen and her ability
to
cook. I remember how proud she was the first time she served
her
grandmother Sherry's matzah balls and barley to a gathering of
friends. She wanted to share this tradition with some of her
friends
at school and had actually gotten Sherry to donate one of her
saltshakers so that the meal would be as authentic as if we had
eaten
it defrosted out of Sherry's frozen stockpile with a bit of cream
cheese followed by ice cream. Served with seltzer, of course.
The meal
was delicious even though—in Emma's words—it was more  &quot;matzah
mush&quot; than &quot;matzah ball&quot; soup. She was so proud
to have been able to share
this tradition with her new and continued friends.</p>
<p>Some things that Emma loved:</p>
<p>Nan Goldin, Sleater Kinney, sunglasses, the Met, taking cabs,
road
trips, <i>Heathers,</i> the <i>Wizard of Oz</i>, Giotto's angels, bagels, the
Sunday
<i>Times</i>, Coney Island, Morningstar Farms, Bollywood, Mrs. Rabbit,
Gary
Indiana, Riverside Park, theme restaurants, the magic hour, Mimiya
cameras, biking in Hyde Park, Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere,
day
planners, the Pre-Raphaelites, <i>Life As We Know It,</i> adventures,
Provincetown, Marie Cassatt, correctly pronouncing Italian foods
in
American restaurants…</p>
<p>With an unforgetting love, I bid fair peace to my and our
dearest Emma.</p>
