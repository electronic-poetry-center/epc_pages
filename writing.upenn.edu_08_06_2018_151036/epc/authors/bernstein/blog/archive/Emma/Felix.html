<p>I can’t help thinking of the line, “When one door closes,
another opens,” and what that has meant to me in the past few
weeks. One door has closed, just as all my doors were opening,
all my lights turning on. And now to go through those doors is
going to mean something entirely different. My path was disrupted
yet has not changed. My destiny will have a loss in its memory,
to be the background of whatever my foreground becomes. But I
walk the path just the same, learning to embrace the shadows
that follow me. Emma’s writings suggested that one must <em>be</em> despite
polarities. One such polarity, life and death, is something that
will be hard to ignore. Yet I will persist in my loving of Emma.
Our love was never constrained to life and death, anyway, and
it won’t start now. </p>
<p>How artists around me have understood this demonstrates how
coping requires you to find the process that means the most to
you. I sang at the funeral –  “Everytime We Say Goodbye.” To
the audience it may have been a comfort to hear a musical expression
of their grief. To me it was a comfort to express my doors paradox:
As I said goodbye, it was time for me to say hello, to announce
myself as an adult to the over 400 people present and to sing
in front of them: expose my destiny to them. </p>
<p>How much the door closes behind me I am not certain. After
Emma’s death I was certain that she lived on in me. I told my
parents to concentrate on her life not her death. I felt her
strength being passed to me. Julie Patton told me of her sibling,
a great singer, passing and of Julie literally being given her
voice, suddenly being able to sing. </p>
<p>I like to think the beautiful room is not empty. That both
Emma and I are mingling within it. Playing dress-up and discussing
gender together, forever. That beautiful room, the one of my
art and her art, my soul and her soul, is never destroyed by
death. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one such beautiful room;
in visiting with Toni Simon, I found it was quite alive and timeless.
Nothing was more comforting then being surrounded by archetypal
symbols of my suffering, giving me a perspective that changed
my perspective. </p>
<p>Reading James Hillman’s <em>Inter Views</em> at the time of
Emma’s death and finishing it after also helped me realize my
place in a world of suffering and love. And helped me come to
the conclusion that in many harrowing ways Emma’s doors have
closed to all of us, we’ve been shut out.  But in many other
ways the beautiful room is full. I can help make those sweet
dreams of hers come true. I won’t ever give up on it: Finding
a strength that she couldn’t and using it for her. In the tarot
card Strength, which Toni gave me a week ago, an angelic white
woman tamed a giant red beast. The card is my fate. I will be
strong enough to help enliven and continue the work of my sister.
We shared that room our whole lives and I am not alone in it
now. I will continue to learn from her and be inspired by her
and sing for her and write for her (and with her). Her death
awoke this room to me more fully than ever before. And a part
of me misses the days before her death when this room was trivial
and all was easy. But the door is wide open now and as I walk
into it, making the melancholy voyage into adulthood, across
the bridge of uncertainty, into the forest of my dreams. I will
never let Emma leave my side: that fashionable, smiling, wonder-woman,
Nan Goldin-loving, Betty Boop, photographer, extroverted, lovable
genius that she always will remain.  </p>
