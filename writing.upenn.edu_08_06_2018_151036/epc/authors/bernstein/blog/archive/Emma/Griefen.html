<p>For Emma Bee Bernstein, my friend and feminist co-conspirator</p>
<p>Before Emma left for Italy we met to get drinks and dinner
in Brooklyn. We sat by the fire in the backyard of Iona’s on
Grand Street and tried to catch up about all that had happened
in her life since she had last been home. There was always too
much to share in too short a time and we talked fast.  I told
her how proud I was of her for the internship at the Peggy Guggenheim
Collection.  She was tired, nervous and unsure, but quickly switched
to the topic of what she’d like to do with her second book. 
She planned to put together a book of interviews and portraits
of feminist artists she’d been working on and I was honored she
asked me to work on it with her.  We parted ways after dinner
but ran into each other later that evening.  Emma always seemed
to be everywhere at the same time.  When we sat outside briefly
to smoke a cigarette before I left, she joked about her hopes
of being swept away by an Italian prince while in Venice.<br />

I met Emma in high school at Friends Seminary when she was a
freshman and I was finishing my senior year. I was drawn immediately
from afar to her warmth, her incredible energy, and her ripped
pink fishnets and matching hair. The few years difference in
age and the short time we spent together at the same school made
very little difference in the depth of our friendship.  When
many other high school students were relishing a Sunday to sleep
in, Emma would make plans for us to see a museum show early in
the day, some galleries in the afternoon and a double feature
in the evening, with time in between to stop home for dinner
with her family. While I felt lucky to be frequently called upon
for opinions of her newest writing or photographs, more often
than not Emma was the one who introduced me to something new,
and I was the one to feel forever grateful to know her.  Because
Emma brought me to a young feminist organization, a New York
City Chapter meeting of Riot Grrrl she often attended, I found
a community of friends and fellow feminists, many whom I am closest
with even now.  Because of Emma, I found a career working with
women artists that gives more meaning to my life than I had before
thought possible. </p>
<p>From the time when we first worked in the darkroom together
over eight years ago, I was deeply impressed with Emma’s photographs.
Even in her earliest adolescent play with portraiture - a kind
of dress up game of which she never tired – she exhibited an
extra ordinary ability to bring something hidden out in her subjects.
I watched as her work grew throughout college.  I admired how
she fought to maintain her independent vision even when it was
not understood by those who has somehow missed the last thirty
years of feminist intervention in the art world.  Despite her
age, Emma had already exhibited her work at the Museum of Contemporary
Art in Chicago, The SMART Museum, and at A.I.R. Gallery, among
other venues. When she spoke about her most recent Masquerade
series at &quot;Beyond the Waves: Feminist Artist’s Talk Across
Generations,&quot; a panel I organized last year at the Brooklyn
Museum which also featured her mother, Susan Bee, Emma spoke
with wisdom and wit making a lasting impact on the audience members,
many who have contacted me since regarding her work. At the time
she said her historical influences for this series, were “Julia
Margaret Cameron and John Singer Sargent but filtered through
Antonioni and John Waters.” Like Julia Margaret Cameron’s women,
Emma’s subjects each exhibit a deep sense of agency, a knowingness
that suggests mystery and conspiracy, a beautiful and unsettling
collapse of artist and subject. No matter their actual distance
from the camera one feels close &#8212; often uncomfortably close
&#8212; to the people in her images &#8212; especially when it
is Emma herself. Her photographs are at once confrontational
and alluring.  She loved to play with opposites.</p>
<p>Emma’s commitment to collaboration is inherent in her photographs
and in all else that she created. I feel so lucky to list myself
among her many feminist co-conspirators. In an essay she wrote
after receiving a scholarship to attend The Feminist Future
Symposium at  the Museum of Modern Art in 2007, Emma wrote: “Let
feminism be an amorphous conceptual cloud that floats over women’s
ideation and visual experience &#8212; and that brings us together
instead of partitions us off from one another.” She thought that
perhaps, among other things the real hope for the future of feminism
might be, “the sustained creation of communities of support and
the continued bonds of sisterhood.” Almost everything she did
she shared, inviting others in to build something better together.
In the spirit of her brand of feminism, she never forgot to look
back, thankfully; for all that others had created before her.
But she was also gifted with an incredibly innovative mind. Every
new project she envisioned had a larger purpose and was based
on building communities, friendships and even movements that
would continue to grow organically and change the lives of her
friends, family, fellows feminists and artists and even many
woman and men she never met. I already feel how much I miss working
with Emma and sharing in her new ideas but I know that the work
she did - her writing and images &#8212; will continue to shape
my life and many others.</p>
<p>Emma, I love you and miss you everyday.</p>
