<p><b>For Emma Bee Bernstein</b></p>
<p>Ten years ago, Emma had her Bat Mitzvah on a day when the
atmosphere was volatile, threatening to storm. As the service
went on, the sky darkened, clouds lowered. But when Emma was
called to do her Torah portion and took her place before the
open scroll, a huge bolt of lightning cracked and an enormous
clap of thunder broke right over the synagogue. Emma had a flair
for drama. </p>
<p>I saw Emma in Chicago last summer. We had breakfast on a hot,
sticky morning when the glaring light was unkind to the gritty
urban neighborhood around the stop on the subway where we met.
A neighborhood not so much abandoned as left behind, it was almost
entirely deserted, but near to new galleries and a place Emma
was going for a symposium in the afternoon. When we went into
the breakfast place, however, it was, improbably, teeming with
people. From the back room three fully frocked Roman Catholic
priests appeared, dark ravens with winter skin, one tall and
sallow, one small and round with a fringe, one swarthy, heavily
built. They were not just characters, but types, as was the hash-slinging
slangy hello-dearies-honeys you are lucky you are getting anything
to eat waitress who treated us with exaggerated familiarity.
And there were children crawling over tables and under chairs,
picking up massive amounts of foot stuffs and sticking things
all over their cheeks, in their hair, screeching, cooing, caterwauling,
crying. In the midst of all this, a leprous homeless man, dancing
in and out among us. These were not just figures, types, but
stereotypes, archetypes. Emma and I spoke about art, her work,
photography, fashion, the avant-garde, and critical views in
some semblance of a sane exchange of common interests in the
midst of this mayhem. Later I realized that it was the theater
of Emmaâ€™s vivid imagination we had entered into, conjured according
to the exaggerating principles of her psychic universe. </p>
<p>Emma, our dear beautiful Emma, we will miss you as much as
we love you. </p>
