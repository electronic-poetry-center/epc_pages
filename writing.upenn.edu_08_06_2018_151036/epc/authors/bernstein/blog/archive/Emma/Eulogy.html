<p><strong><font size="+1">Eulogy for Emma</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beauty is momentary in the mind—<br />
The fitful tracing of a portal; <br />
But in the flesh it is immortal. <br />
<br />
The body dies; the body's beauty lives. <br />
So evenings die, in their green going, <br />
A wave, interminably flowing. <br />
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting <br />
The cowl of Winter, done repenting. <br />
                                    – Wallace Stevens</p>

<p><em>The day dark is when you I cannot see.</em></p>
<p>What happened to Emma is unfathomably unfair and excruciatingly
painful. Nothing I can say here will go beyond those two obdurate
facts. </p>
<p>Emma was surrounded by love and returned that love; and she
gave her love generously, even recklessly, as those of us know
who were lucky enough to have bathed in her angelic glow. But
love failed, love was insufficient to save her against the demons
inside her that grabbed hold of her hand and would not let go,
no matter how fiercely she fought against them. We know Emma
was always fierce so let it not go unacknowledged that in her
last moments she struggled fiercely and with all her soul against
something more powerful than she had ever known. Emma showed
the same courage in her last days as she did throughout her life;
the courage that made her seem to herself invincible and to us
indomitable – a blazing force of nature, a fiery comet that lit
up our lives, burning so bright it sometimes blinded, sometimes
scalded, burning until suddenly, catastrophically, the ball of
fire that she was expired. </p>
<p><em>Dark is the day when you I cannot see.</em></p>
<p>Emma’s courage illuminates her being even as it leaves us
dumbfounded that she could have come to this end. Only those
who have come close to something like what enveloped Emma in
the instant of her death can know how much she must have suffered
in the moment – so that all the care of those who loved her was
vanished from her thoughts and was banished from her heart. We
rightly rage against her death and against her for failing us,
for leaving us, we who had such hopes for her and who had hitched
the meaning of our lives on hers. Or then we search for some
meaning in a life cut short, a life of infinite potential, as
all lives have at such an age. But finding conscious purpose
in her death is to wrest meaning from its annihilation, adding
psychic insult to traumatic tragedy. For Emma’s death was an
act of total despair beyond her control, precipitated by a concussion
she had from a disastrous car wreck in late July of this year. </p>
<p>There is no consolation for her death – only going on in the
face of it, if and as we can.</p>
<p><em>Dark the day when you I cannot see.<strong></strong></em></p>
<p>So many of the letters we have received start by saying there
are no words sufficient for a tragedy of this kind. I keep thinking
– if that sentiment is too widely shared, it’s going to put us
poets our of business (what little business there is for us).
The problem is not that words are inadequate but that such a
terrifying turn as this leaves us speechless, is unspeakable,
or let’s say puts us on the border of sense and senselessness,
cry and communication. For us – Susan and Felix and me – all
the words we have been offered have been welcome and appreciated,
as water to those in a desert, even, maybe especially, those
words that begin by saying <em>there are no words …</em> <br />
<br />
People say you know who your friends are at a time like this
but what has happened to us goes beyond that; as we were sinking
deep into oceans of sorrows, we were buoyed up by a collective
force, a community, of poets and artists and family, that seems
determined not to let us sink. So many have been there for us,
even now when we have lost a sense of our own being there. </p>
<p>A father’s grief, a mother’s tears are all in vain. Because
the thing we both most feared came true. Emma is gone. All the
ways we try to come to terms with that always end the same; even
to think of coming to terms with this is obscene. </p>
<p>Nothing we think or say or feel will bring Emma back again,
she who was the center of our days and now haunts our nights. </p>
<p><em>Dark is, the day, when you I cannot see.</em></p>
<p>Felix says we must think not of Emma’s death but her life,
and he is right.</p>
<p>The meaning of Emma’s life cannot be measured by its end,
but by the quality of its being. Still, if it was in my power,
I would exchange that quality for time, to have her here again.
Nothing can ever compensate for her absence. </p>
<p><em>The day dark is when you I cannot see.</em></p>
<p>I wish I could use some black magic, fueled by all our grief,
and bring Emma back. I wish, like, Orpheus, I could go now to
the underworld to call her back to life, as my trip to Venice
now seems like a journey to Hades, travelling alone by boat to
a dream-like world of water and labyrinthine streets in a vain
effort to rescue her. And yet every day I think there must be
a way, that of all people, Emma, like the Houdini she was, would
find a way; only to have such idle waves of compulsive thoughts
smashed on the shores of reality.<br />
<em><br />
Dark, dark the day when you I cannot see.</em></p>
<p>In 2005, Emma created a site-specific conceptual photography
project in which she placed large hand-printed photographs –
unframed and vulnerable to the weather, which ultimately damaged
them – in different parts of the University of Chicago campus,
so that the viewer would encounter them in familiar yet unexpected
places. The photos, like her short life, were a gift, but a gift
not to have and hold but to come upon, so that the encounter
would change your relation to where you met it (or where it met
you), just as our encounter with Emma changes our relation to
where we met her or where she met us. Stanley Cavell wrote her
an email in response to this work – “you show,” he wrote her,
 “that human ingenuity not only takes away impressions but leaves
their impressions present where they have called, a persistent
present, immortal in its transience, forever part of history
that this happened there then that way.” </p>
<p><em>The day dark is when you I cannot see.</em></p>
<p>People say that losing a child is one of the worst thing that
can happen to a person. Surely, Emma’s death is, by leaps and
bounds, the most catastrophic thing that has happened to me.
But grief knows no hierarchies. For the mourner, the pain of
loss has no respect for whether a death is more or less appropriate,
timely or untimely, natural or unnatural. But I also know that
worse by far than the pain of Emma’s death, unbearable as it
to bear, would have been to be deprived of the pulsing, piercing,
radiant light that was her life; a light in which I woke each
day, richer; a light which I feel, even know, warming my chill
bones. </p>
<p>Tennyson writes in “In Memoriam” –</p>
<p>              I envy not in any moods <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; The captive
void of noble rage, <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; The linnet
born within the cage, <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; That never
knew the summer woods: <br />
              …. <br />
              I hold it true, whate'er befall; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   I feel it, when
I sorrow most; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  'Tis better to have
loved and lost <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Than never
to have loved at all.</p>
<p>Emma was a gift, one that we could not possess or contain,
but one for which I forever will be grateful. She transformed
my life as she constantly informed me; she remade my ideas, animated
my writing, was my great companion in conversation, in life,
in art, as she was for Susan and Felix. Her spirit is in everything
we are, do, and will do.</p>
<p><em>The day dark is when you I cannot see.</em></p>
<p>We have been overwhelmed with letters and calls and conversations
in praise of Emma. But for us, if Emma had done nothing in her
life, our grief would be no less; if Emma had died in some other
way, our grief would be no less; if she were less beautiful than
she was, our grief would be no less. </p>
<p><em>Grief knows no hierarchies.</em> </p>
<p>If we can feel sometimes, as Emma told us so many times, that
we did for all we could for her, to protect, support, and encourage
her, all we knew how, our grief is not abated, because as parents
anything short of her living is a cruel failure to which we will
never reconcile ourselves. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once more we sang: &quot;They do not die<br />
Nor lose their mortal sympathy,<br />
Nor change to us, although they change …”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Emma’s life <em>was</em> filled with astonishing vivacity,
intellectual adventure, and artistic accomplishment. Emma was
an enthusiastic participant and leader in all the things she
did, from her early schools and friendships, to her beloved Camp
Kinderland, to her days at Friends Seminary. </p>
<p>Emma loved to travel – first going to Italy – in high school
and later returning there two more times, but also spending a
semester in India and travelling throughout Europe.</p>
<p>And she loved her work for museums – first at the Brooklyn
Museum as a tour guide and later at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, the Smart Museum, the Renaissance Society, and the Art Institute
in Chicago, and most recently as a teaching artist at the Museum
of Contemporary Arts in Chicago. She was in Venice, Italy, this
past month working as an intern at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection,
where she had just presented a seminar on <em>GirlDrive</em> and
her photography and where she died. The Guggenheim closed the
day following her death in her honor. </p>
<p>Emma was also a fabulously lively writer who thought profoundly
about aesthetics, especially the presumed conflict of art and
fashion, a binary she worked ferociously to undermine. When she
was 13, at her Bat Mitzvah, she argued with the rabbi about the
existence of God; after that, no comfortable thought was safe
against her probing questions and her stubborn brilliance. At
the University of Chicago she was the photography editor and
photographer for the student newspaper and then later for a new
magazine of erotica (which she far preferred).  She wrote a senior
thesis on fashion, art, and masquerade but beyond that produced
a major body of photographs that put her ideas into action. The
photographs are astonishingly good, conceptually and aesthetically. 
She graduated from University of Chicago with a BA with honors
in Art History and Visual Arts in 2007. And in the time since,
published essays on a new generation of feminists, spoke on several
panels, and exhibited her work in New York and Chicago</p>
<p>Her photographs were one part of <em>GirlDrive</em>, her fundamental
focus for the past year. She and  Nona Willis Aronowitz  got
a book contract from Seal Press for this inspiring project of
social activism and feminism in/as a road trip. The book plans
and web site ripple with an infectious liberation and exuberant
charm. GirlDrive includes Emma’s marvelously inventive portrait
photographs along with interviews and reflections and writings
by Nona, to which Emma also contributed. Yet Emma has already
begun interviewing artists for Henry Hills’s epic film <em>Emma’s
Dilemma,</em> which she began working on when she was 12 years
old. <em>Emma’s Dilemma </em>includes filmed interviews with
dozens of artists, in which the  young Emma asks startling and
unexpected questions, disarming even the most canny and guarded
interview subjects. </p>
<p>During her final weeks, she was working on a book for Belladonna,
the women’s poetry series in New York. She had finished the basic
work for the book and was looking forward to a February event,
where she was to appear with Marjorie Perloff and Susan. That
book will be out soon and perhaps we will find a way to celebrate
her, her politics, and her commitment at the Belladonna event
in February.<br />
            . <br />
I last saw her in Venice a few weeks ago. During her days off
we went to museums and museum, church after church, Emma dwelling
on each painting or fresco, ecstatic about the magnificence of
each work, explaining to me the genius of Tintoretto’s chiaroscuro
and Max Ernst’s birds.</p>
<p>No one who met her, from the high school kids she tutored
in Chicago, to the campers she counseled, to her U Chicago professors,
to her many intimate friends and her extended family, forgot
her. She lived a full life compressed into her 23 years.</p>
<p>Swinburne writes –</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no help, for all these things are so, <br />
And all the world is bitter as a tear. <br />
….<br />
She shall not hear us if we sing hereof,&nbsp; <br />
Nor see love's ways, how sore they are and steep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dickinson says
that “after great pain” comes </p>
<blockquote>
<p>            …
the hour of lead<br />
Remembered if outlived,<br />
As freezing persons recollect the snow--<br />
First chill, then stupor, then the letting go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we will not, cannot let go, not now, not yet. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> ….neither
the angels in Heaven above, <br />
Nor the demons down under the sea, <br />
Can ever dissever our souls from the soul <br />
Of the beautiful Emma Bee:-- </p>
