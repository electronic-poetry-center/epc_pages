Is Art Criticism Fifty Years Behind Poetry?</b></font></span></p>

<p><span class="rss-content">In <i>Frank O&rsquo;Hara: The Poetics

of Coterie</i><a href="Parkett.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a>,

Lytle Shaw&rsquo;s ostensive subject is how &ldquo;coterie&rdquo; works

in the poetry and poetics of Frank O&rsquo;Hara. The opening

chapters provide a cogent discussion of the role of proper names

in O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s poetry within the context of a linguistics-inflected

examination of naming and reference. Shaw notes the different

levels of proper naming in O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s work &ndash; figures

of popular culture, political and social figures, as well as

different levels of his personal circle (from identifiable artists

and poets to obscure names). <br>

<br>

For Shaw, coterie is not a closed world of intimates but an interlocking,

open-ended set of associations and affiliations. He links coterie

to the socio-historically self-conscious poetics of the local,

community, and other collective formations. The poetics of coterie

is presented by Shaw as an alternative to universalizing conceptions

of poetry. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s location of himself not in an

homogenous elite but rather in intersecting constellations of

persons (real and imagined affiliations), together with his famous

time-stamping of his poems (it&rsquo;s 12:18 in New York as I

rewrite this sentence) both work against the Romantic Ideology

of timeless poems by great individuals. <br>

<br>

Still, no discussion of coterie can completely free itself from

the negative connotations of <i>clique</i> and <i>scene</i>.

For best effect, the first chapters of Shaw&rsquo;s book should

be read beside Andrew Epstein&rsquo;s&nbsp; <i>Beautiful Enemies:

Friendship and Postwar American Poetry</i><a href="Parkett.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a>.

Epstein offers exemplary Emersonian readings of the intricate

web connecting individual talent and collective investment in

the poetry and poetics of John Ashbery, Amiri Baraka, and O&rsquo;Hara.

Averting the Cold War myth of the individual voice in the wilderness

of conformity, Epstein gives us voices in conversation and conflict,

suggesting that resistance to agreement is at the heart of a

pragmatist understanding of literary community.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

&nbsp;The role of proper names and the nature of O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s

personal circle are not the only concerns of <i>Frank O&rsquo;Hara:

The Poetics of Coterie</i>. In the book&rsquo;s final chapters,

another theme emerges with equal force: O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s

approach to the visual arts in his poems and criticism. Shaw

sees O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s art writing as a powerful and necessary

counter to the monological and hyperprofessional rigidity that

descends from Clement Greenberg (who dismissed O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s

art writing) to Michael Fried and, I&rsquo;d add, extends to

the <i>October</i> brand, the epitome of, let&rsquo;s just say,

High Orthodoxical art criticism. For if the luminous rigor and

prodigious insights of Greenberg and Fried end in the tragedy

of misrecognition, the self-serious vanguardism of the High Orthodoxical

ends in the farce of academic gate-keeping and market validation.

In other words, Greenberg&rsquo;s and Fried&rsquo;s insistence

on <i>conviction</i> and <i>agonism</i> morphed into a practice

of regulation by exclusion.<br>

<br>

For Shaw, the aversion of poetry in both formalist and High Orthodoxical

art criticism is a sign of its own aesthetic failure. In contrast

to Greenberg&rsquo;s and Fried&rsquo;s rebuke of &ldquo;poetic&rdquo;  art

criticism, he suggests that O&rsquo;Hara was doing an &ldquo;art-critical&rdquo; poetry

that, for example, has resonances with Robert Smithson&rsquo;s

writing.<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a> &ldquo;O&rsquo;Hara

moves toward modes of hybridization and proliferation that are

diametrically opposed to the narrowing lexical range Greenberg

and Fried imagined as the cure to a threatened art criticism

of the 1950s and the 1960s&rdquo; (p. 171).&nbsp; Shaw illustrates

his point with a&nbsp; a section&nbsp;  of O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s

poem &ldquo;Second Avenue&rdquo; that explicitly addresses DeKooning: <br>

<br>

The silence that lasted for a quarter century. All<br>

the babies were born blue. They called him &ldquo;Al&rdquo; and &ldquo;Horseballs&rdquo;<br>

in kindergarten, he had an autocratic straw face like a dark<br>

in a DeKooing where the torrent has subsided at the very center<br>

classism, it can be many whirlpools in a gun battle<br>

or each individual pang in the  &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; of electrodes,

so<br>

totally unlike xmas tree ornaments that you wonder, uhmmm?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what

the bourgeoisie is thinking of. Trench coat. Broken strap. <br>

<br>

O&rsquo;Hara practiced a complicit<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">4</a> and

promiscuous criticism that stands in stark contrast to the ideologies

of formalist criticism of his time and the <i>October</i>-tinged

orthodoxicalities of the 1970s and 1980s. &nbsp;As Shaw puts

it, &ldquo;O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s painting poems present &hellip; a

special kind of interdisciplinarity, or what Michael Fried would

call &lsquo;theatricality&rsquo; &hellip; They &hellip; initiate

almost infinite substitutions among discourses in their rapid,

line-to-line attempt to imagine contexts for painting. <i>It

is for that reason that they seem, and are, antiprofessional</i>&rdquo; (p.

179; italics added).<br>

<br>

Both formalist and the later <i>October</i>-branded criticism

and its many knock-offs preached views of meaning that, while

at odds with one another, were sufficiently proscriptive as to

void the full range of aesthetic approaches in the art championed

and to simply dismiss (as &ldquo;pernicious,&rdquo; as Fried

called  &ldquo;Dada&rdquo;<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a>)

work that contested the limits of received ideas of meaning-making.

This criticism operated not by &ldquo;negating&rdquo; or deconstructing

meaning (the empty encomium of the High Orthodoxical Art) but

by articulating newly emerging constructions of meaning-as-constellations

(a poetics of affiliation, association, combine, conglomeration,

collage, and coterie). In effect, both formalist and High Orthodoxical

criticism see theatrical or allegorical methods, respectively,

as emptying meaning. But while the former decries the putative

demise of opticality and the latter valorizes it, neither has

a sufficiently pliable approach to engage with the new semantic

embodiments of the  &ldquo;frail / instant,&rdquo; as O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s

puts it in his poem &ldquo;For Bob Rauschenberg.&rdquo;<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">6</a> O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s &ldquo;frail

/ instant&rdquo; could be called the weak absorption of coterie,

which, like the &ldquo;unevenness&rdquo; of everyday life is

both discontinuous and fluid, self-aware and constructive, &ldquo;semantically

various and unstable,&rdquo; atomized and chaining.<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">7</a>&nbsp; O&rsquo;Hara &ndash; in

his reviled poeticizing &ndash; was able to articulate a poetics

of adjacency, of queer juxtapositions, to which his critical

others remained blind.<br>

<br>

Thomas McEvilley makes the point very succinctly in his 1982

essay &ldquo;Head It&rsquo;s Form, Tales It&rsquo;s Not Content,&rdquo;  prefacing

his remarks with a quote from O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s &ldquo;Having

a Coke with You&rdquo; &ndash; <br>

and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just

paint <br>

you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them &hellip;<br>

<br>

Here&rsquo;s McEvilley:<br>

In the attempt to free art from the plane of content, the formalist

tradition denied that elements of the artwork may refer outside

the work toward the embracing world. Rather, the elements are

to be understood as referring to one another inside the work,

in an interior and self-subsistent esthetic code. The claim is

imprecisely and incompletely made, however, because the formalists

take much too narrow a view of what can constitute &ldquo;content.&rdquo; Greenberg,

for example, often uses the term  &ldquo;non-representational&rdquo; to

describe &ldquo;pure&rdquo; artworks &ndash; those purified of

the world. But as he uses it, the term seems to rule out only

clear representations of physical objects such as chairs, bowls

of fruit, or naked figures lying on couches. Similarly, Fried,

assumed that only &ldquo;recognizable objects, persons and places&rdquo; can

provide the content of a painting. But art that is non-representational

in this sense may still be representational in others. It may

be bound to the surrounding world by its reflection of structures

of thought, political tensions, psychological attitudes, and

so forth. <a href="Parkett.html#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">8</a> <br>

<br>

As Shaw acidly notes, to cast &ldquo;the poetic&rdquo; as the

last bastion of private insights, or indeed &ldquo;as a kind

of metaphysics of content, of pure meaning,&rdquo; requires a

concerted effort to ignore the formally radical poetries outside

the domain of Official Verse Culture and especially those poetries

that explore collage, collision, disjunction, overlay, and contradiction. &nbsp;Mispresented  &ldquo;as

such it is no wonder that the poetic has had a long list of detractors &ndash; stretching

from Greenberg and Fried to Benjamin Buchloh and James Meyer&rdquo; (p.

220). Indeed,  &ldquo;they&rdquo;&ndash;&nbsp; both the prophets

of a sublime late modernism and the apostates who argued for

dystopian postmodernism &ndash; &nbsp;&ldquo;were all cheated

of some marvelous experience / which is not going to go wasted

on me which is why I am telling you about it,&rdquo;  as O&rsquo;Hara

wryly puts it in the final lines of &ldquo;Having a Coke with

You.&rdquo;<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">9</a> O&rsquo;Hara

is not, <i>not nearly</i>, the better critic, and Shaw shows

his allegiances as being more to the <i>in between</i> than to

any one of his shifting positions &ndash; curator, poet, critic,

lover, social magnet, arts administrator. But more than &ldquo;they&rdquo; he

recognized that &ldquo;form is never more than an extension of

content.&rdquo;<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">10</a> &nbsp;<br>

<br>

This is certainly not to say that the normative, descriptive,

fashion- and market-driven modes of art criticism are to be preferred,

whether written by poets or not. The problem is not that art

criticism is too conceptually complex but, on the contrary, that &ndash; &ndash; even

at its putatively most theoretical &ndash; its poetics and aesthetics

are too often willfully stunted, marked by a valorized incapacity

to respond to how meaning is realized through multiple, incommensurable,

or overlaid discourses &ndash; <i>kinship</i>, in Shaw&rsquo;s

terms &ndash; within a single work. Meaning is not an end but

a between.<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">11</a> &nbsp;<br>

<br>

The significance of O&rsquo;Hara (or McEvilley or Shaw) is not

that they are poets who do criticism, which is also true of Fried,

but their polymorphous dexterity of their writing; their aversion

of simple description (of visual appearance or of ideas) in pursuit

of phenomenological unevenness (in Shaw&rsquo;s terms) or complexity

found in the visual art work they address. This is the legacy

of Baudelaire, Mallarm&eacute;, Apollinaire, and Stein, not the &ldquo;belle

lettristic&rdquo; approach that is often, and banally, contrasted

with orthodoxical criticism. <br>

<br>

Shaw&rsquo;s approach provides a useful historical context for

such projects as <i>M/E/A/N/I/N/G</i>.<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">12</a> In

doing so, it helps to explain not only the aversion of radical

poetics and poetry in formalist and <i>October-</i>flavored criticism

of the 60s to 80s, but also the fear of the taint of poetry by

even such apparently poetry-related artists as Lawrence Weiner

(who declines to have his work exhibited in poetry-related contexts).

</span><span class="rss-content">Consider,  for example, that Meyer, in his introduction to a recent collection of the  poetry of Carl Andre, never mentions the word &ldquo;poetry.&rdquo;<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">13</a> The

lesson is that linguistic works of Weiner or Andre (Vito Acconci

or Jenny Holzer) can only be deemed significant <i>as art</i> if

they are purged of any connection to (radically impure, content-concatenating)

poetry and poetics. <br>
As Dominique Fourcade noted at the Poetry Plastique symposium,

poetry literarily devalues visual art (we were talking about

how Philip Guston&rsquo;s collaborations with Clark Coolidge

had a lower economic value than comparable works without words).<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">14</a> But

perhaps this devaluation provides a necessary route for removing

visual art from any Aesthetic System that mocks both aesthesis

and social aspiration.<a href="Parkett.html#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""> </a> <br>

<br>
Reading Shaw&rsquo;s study of the 50s and 60s, underscores, once

again, how, indeed, <i>pernicious</i> is the clich&eacute; that

poetry is fifty years behind visual art. On the contrary, art

criticism, insofar as it succumbs to a paranoiac fear of theatricality

that induces frame-lock, lags behind poetry at its peril. Meanwhile,

the visual and verbal arts remain complicit with one another

50 years ago and today. </span></p>
