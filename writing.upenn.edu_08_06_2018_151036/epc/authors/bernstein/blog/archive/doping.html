Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose poetry has been <br>
linked to his
use of <font arial="" helvetica="" font="" face="verdana," size="-1">laudanum </font> and nitrous oxide.

<p><br>
July 30, New York (AHP2 News Service) &ndash; The poetry world
has been rocked by recent revelations that several of the most
prestigious national poetry contest winners in 2005 and 2006
were written with the aid of performance-enhancing drugs. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Over the past decade, poetry contests have emphasized
our openness to all participants, with the promise that each
manuscript is judged on its merits along,&rdquo; said Guadalupe
Maximino Glumstein, the Chancellor of the International Poetry
Contests Federation (IPCF). &ldquo;Doping is a huge step backward
in our efforts, since it gives an unfair competitive advantage
to those who are willing to do anything, including risk long-term
damage to their bodies and minds, in order to write the best
poem.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The IPCF advocates testing for performance-enhancing drugs
as a prerequisite for national book publications, slam competitions,
as well a poetry contests. Poets that violate IPCF rules would
be ineligible for prizes or anthologies for penalty periods of
one year for first offenders to eternity for repeat offenders.
Poets that comply with IPCF guidelines get a sticker to affix
to all their publications certifying their poems as doping-free. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Unless we want poetry to sink back into the margins
of society, we must assure readers that poets produce their work
with their own sweat and imagination. When we teach a poem to
a young person in a school setting, to inspire and instruct,
we need to be able to say that anyone can aspire to write a poem
as good as this. We can&rsquo;t afford to send a message that
doping is necessary to write the best poems. We have to have
an even playing field.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Several leading poets were asked to comment on the scandal
but refused to talk on the record, for fear of provoking IPCF
investigations of their conduct. Unlike the use of doping in
track and cycling, poets often use poetry-performance-enhancing
drugs to cause temporary physical and mental impairment or paralysis,
in order to hyperactivate their imaginative capacities. The practice
has been shown to cause a number of long-term physical and mental
maladies. </p>
<p> But 11-year old Daisy Threadwhistle of Incontrobrogliaria,
New Jersey, was eager to speak on the record. Ms. Threadwhistle
said she was very disappointed when a poem from her school reader
was removed when its author tested positive for performance-enhancing
drugs. &ldquo; &lsquo;The Moon Is My Revenge, Venus My Soldier
of Midnight&rsquo; &rdquo; was my favorite poem this year. I
feel cheated. I don&rsquo;t think I want to read any more poems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In early 2006, IPCF introduced a battery of blood and psychological
tests to detect poetic doping. An IPCF study group is now investigating
whether the use of certain computer programs and search engines
also should be banned from poetry.</p>
