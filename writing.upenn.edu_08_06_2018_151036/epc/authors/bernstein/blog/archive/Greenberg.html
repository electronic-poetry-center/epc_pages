      <p align="left">Samuel Greenberg &ndash; a second-wave moderist poet &ndash; was born in Vienna  in 1893 and died of tuberculosis in New York in 1917, a the age of 23. An immigrant, he came to New York's Lower East Side  when he was seven and went to school only until the seventh grade.  Unpublished in his own lifetime, Greenberg is primarily known as an  important source for Hart Crane, whose &quot;<a href="http://oocradio.blogspot.com/2006/06/emblems-of-conduct-by-hart-crane.html">Emblems of Conduct</a>&quot; is a pastiche of  Greenberg's work. Similar in sprit to somewhat later second-wave  &quot;ideoloectial&quot; modernists (such as Crane), Greenberg practiced a radical form of  sprung lyric -- a wild, sound-wracked, syntactic syncretism that verges on the  abstract and the rhapsodic, which I associate with Crane and Hopkins (and which also brings Blake to mind), but might  also be described as  a cross between Leo Gorcey reciting Shakespeare and the  poetical works of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. In the postwar period,&nbsp;I'd point to Joseph Ceravolo's <i>Fits of Dawn</i>, many of the works of Clark  Coolidge and J. H. Prynne, Kenneth Koch's <i>When the Sun Tries to Go On</i>,  the early poems of David Marriott, though none of these poets have quite the ecstatic grammatic extavagance&nbsp;of Greenberg (I certainly I feel an affinity with Greenberg in my own farflung sprung lyrics).</p>
      <p>Greenberg's work was first collected as <i>Poems from the Greenberg Manuscripts</i>, edited by James Laughlin (New York: New Directions in 1939); followed by the Henry Holt edition in 1947, <i>Poems: A Selection from the Manuscripts</i>, edited with an introduction by Harold Holden and Jack McManis, with a preface by Allen Tate. Tate described Greenberg's work as   "turgid and bathetic" &#8212; but then  bathos is part of what makes these poems so appealing (and  bathos is a central rhetorical choice of thes poems). Depite the great efforts the editors made to preserve and publish Greenberg's work, their edition makes a number of unwarranted changes to the manuscript, especially with punctuation and capitalization, cleaning the poems up but in the process erasing some of the charming quirkiness and also some key semantic dynamics. </p>
<p>In &quot;Young Poets Dead, &quot; a generous response to Greenberg published in <i>The Sewanee Review</i>, (Vol. 55, No. 3; July-September, 1947), John Berryman writes that Crane and Greenberg share &quot;reliance on inspiration and ejaculation&quot; (p. 505). &quot;There is some power of phrasing, but not much of composition. Greenberg had with rare exceptions so little control over syntax ... &quot; (p. 506). I think this is what I like as much as anything else in these work, what gives them their most radically modernist dimension. His swerve from syntax as a principal of clausal subordination and hierarchy opens up the field of serial apostrophe that pushes to liberate itself from the confines of &quot;literary&quot; diction. </p>
<p align="left">In 2005, Michael Carr and Michael  Smith edited a small edition of Greenberg called <i><a href="http://katalanchepress1.blogspot.com/">Self  Charm: Selected Sonnets &amp; Other Poems, </a></i>ed. (Cambridge:  Katalanch&eacute; Press, 2005). </span><span class="rss-content">The editors have carefully noted the erratic spelling and punctuation of  Greenberg's poems,  for example, restoring the hanging comma in the last line of  &quot;Enigmas&quot;: &ldquo;Mine eye lids shut, I fell into unfelt realms,&rdquo;. </span><span class="rss-content">Greenberg, whose holograph manuscripts are at the Fales collection at New York University, has  been fortunate in finding these remarkable editors. In addition, Michael Smith has  , a stunningly good web site for Greenberg: <a href="http://logopoeia.com/greenberg/">http://logopoeia.com/greenberg/</a>. </span> See for example Smith's <a href="http://logopoeia.com/greenberg/sonnets1.html#spirituality">website version</a> of the &quot;Spirituality&quot; [below] , which corrects erroris in the 1947 published version; note, though, that Smith's web version  does not  use his own late, presumably more accurate, version of &quot;Enigmas.&quot; The web edition is going in the right direction, but it's not there yet.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Apology to Sprituality: A Case Study</b></p>
<p align="left">The 1947 Holt edition reproduce a draft of the &quot;Spirituality&quot; sonnet, but not the final holograph copy text that the editors used for their edition:</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="Greenberg.jpg" width="720" height="970"></p>
<p align="left">Here is my transcription of the draft:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> The Apology<br>
      to Spirituality Sonnet.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">In what finite tendon dost thou rise?<br>
  though pon thy omnipotence, thence we find,<br>
  The glory of wicked truth, which flaps its wings to Bind<br>
  All!&nbsp; But the Hollow lute, that pipes its strain &rsquo;yon!<br>
  Lower Hill, mid vat of fragrance, ah ye<br>
  Melancholy &rsquo;frain. oft have I left thee!<br>
  to slumBer my memory of such real disdain<br>
  I mend no path! since my faith is but<br>
  A star oer noxious Blue - within my soul Hath<br>
  ClomB, unto thy tales of old - round fire listened,<br>
  I saw nobly, that through History - my youth come nigh -<br>
  And whispered joy! E'er this might of love!<br>
  Hath meekly found its room, so called immortality</p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Now, here is the holograph ms of the final version, which the Holt editor's used  as their copy text. The holograph is used with permssion of the Fales Library at New York University; my thanks to Fales for letting me present it here:</p>
<p><img src="Greenberg-Sprituality.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1017"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most striking change from the draft is in the second line, &quot;though pon thy Ominpotence&quot; is now &quot;Though 'pon the omnipresence&quot;. Also Greenberg  added an enire phrase to the final lines, to bring the poem from 13 to 14 lines. </p>
<p align="left">This is what the Holt edtiors printed (changing to make consistent a number of erratic elements in Greenberg final holgraph &ndash; that is, &quot;correcting&quot; punctuation, capitalization, and, in line 9, rendering &quot;clomB&quot; &ndash; past tenese of climb &ndash; as &quot;Climbed&quot;:</p>
<span class="rss-content"><img src="Greenberg-print.jpg" width="576" height="520">
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Here is Michael Smith's transction from the Greenberg web site:
<p><b>Spirituality </b></p>
<p>In what finite tendon dost thou rise?<br>
  though 'pon thy omnipresence, thence we find<br>
  the glory of wicked truth, which flaps its wings To Bind<br>
  All - But the hollow lute, that pipes its strain yon<br>
  Lower Hill, mid vat of fragrance, ah ye<br>
  Melancholy 'frain - oft have I left thee<br>
  To slumber my memory of such real disdain<br>
  I mend no path - since my faith is as<br>
  the star o'er noxious Blue - within my soul Hath<br>
  Clomb, unto the tales of old, 'round fire listened<br>
  I nobly saw, that through History my youth come nigh<br>
  And whispered joy - within my breast from efforts clear<br>
  Forgive our memory stain! e'er this might of love<br>
  Hath meekly, found its room - so called immortality</p>
<p>This is very close to Greenberg's fair copy, and corrects a number of the unwarranted changes in the Holt edition; but closer still would be this transcription by Michael Carr (changes from Smith marked in red).  Carr is presently working on a new edition of the sonnets.</p>

<p>It is not possible to ascertain Greenberg's intentions; for example, in respect to the lower case &quot;t&quot;s that begin four lines (in costrst to the caps that begin all the others) or the final cap in &quot;ClomB.&quot; (As someone who makes many &quot;typogrphical&quot; errors, I undersatnd the problem.) But that is part of the &quot;vat of fragrance&quot; that through which this work &quot;flaps it wings To Bind.&quot;</p>

         Pregnant buds, where spring has failed the lewd heart<br>
         Darkness over the ocean's deep was offering moonlight<br>
         Movable, silver, vanishing waves that enrolled<br>
         The wild summer blossom that in sanguine<br>
         Peace bared the ray of gold; until bronze<br>
         Shades of autumn quietly lowered a<br>
         Humble veil upon the ground in preservation --<br>
         Thick clouds that separate over the<br>
         Spotless blue of glazing greys. A simple<br>
         Tint vanishes, as the storm of fusion<br>
         Displays the shocking flood that vapors have gathered<br><br>
