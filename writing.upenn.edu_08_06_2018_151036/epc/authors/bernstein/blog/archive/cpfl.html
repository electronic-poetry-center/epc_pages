<i>The mask of the original unveiled.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Proposal</b> <br>
The twentieth century appears to have bestowed on us a legacy
of constant and seemingly irreparable disaster. It left us with
the aporia that poetry, as the synthesis of intellectual and
creative activity, has become incapable of dealing with stupidity
and barbarism. This is evident in the Nazi and Fascist crimes
as well as in the institutionalization of economic violence in
a world that is becoming both global and disorganized at the
same rate, with catastrophic consequences in the form of local,
ethnic conflicts moved by hate, sectarianisms, and private tragedies.
What remains of the nationalist projects has become a strategy
to strengthen corporate interests; at the same time, internationalism,
rather than opening up to pluralistic and democratic human experiences,
has boiled down to a strategy of exploitation&mdash;economic,
touristic, and for the sake of legitimizing racial and social
prejudices. </p>
<p> In the beginning of this century, a new form of such violence has begun to emerge, one derived precisely from its continued existence: it is the muffling, the dampening down of the scene of destruction. An impotent creation --lagging behind technology, the market and a voracious media and communications industry, lacking any political impact or liberating aesthetic--, it survives by shrinking poetic goals or the audience for poetry. Skepticism vis-&agrave;-vis revolutionary transformation, the consistency of the avant-gardes or ideological dogmatism has not resulted in actions that are freer, as we would like to think, but, instead, has given us a more garrulous production in increasingly homogeneous environments. Joint property of peers, corporate genre practices&mdash;all these fragment and render poetic production banal. Parochial activity takes offence at criticism and debate. Condescendence, lack of courage, a pact of peers, mutual forgiveness make evident the scant seriousness accorded to poetry, as well as the disbelief in its transformative power. But what type of real production could relinquish the power to transform? </p>
     <p> An impressive consequence of that legacy of catastrophic continuities (which precisely dampens down and absorbs disaster as a normal occurrence) is the conformity poetry displays vis-&agrave;-vis an average production. In that environment, writing becomes an inconsequential habit, a &quot; hobby&quot;&mdash;i.e., a activity of one's childhood or youth and that one abandons upon reaching adulthood, or that is continued merely as a weekend activity--, or instead, a professional occupation, as any other, a modest way to earn a living alongside other editorial or university-teaching tasks. In such times, there is no more reason to expel the poets from the Republic --as Plato would have it&mdash;which does not mean a lack of spiritual progress: apparently, no poet is perceived as dangerous anymore, as incongruous or rapturous, to the point of affecting the disorderly order of contemporary uncivil life.</p>
     <p> How to respond to such a lack of vision and of urgency peculiar to poetry, a realm that by definition is hostile to mediocrity? How to resist that barbarian shrinking of horizons, proportional to the redundant proliferation of garrulous writing? Or, at least, how to denaturalize disaster and reconquer the pain emerging from it? Can poetry still be more than an affirmation of frivolity, arrivisme, and intellectual affectation or --on the opposite end of the spectrum-- of loutish modesty and a hopeless remainder? If we don't already have plans for the future, it's important to say that the present also does not belong to us: the dampening down of expectations produces indifference, alienation and routine, not the enjoyment of a pleasant life. What can poetry do against this state of things which seems to have no end? And if it can do nothing, can it be more than frivolity? </p>

           Title of talk: <br>
&quot;On the Superfluous&quot;&nbsp; </p>
     <p>Abstract: <br>
         The process of writing is a process of endless and leading re-reading, i. e., displaying the &quot;self&quot; at the margin of the experience, where poetry itself, as a form of the &quot;speech,&quot; is impossible yet where in fact it reveals the possibility of&nbsp;&quot;becoming.&quot;<br>
R&eacute;sum&eacute;: <br>
My name is Arkadii Dragomoshchenko.<br>
I'm retired but I continue to run a seminar entitled &quot;Another Logic of Writing&quot; at the &quot;Smolny Institute of Liberal Arts and Science&quot; (an affiliate of New York's Bard College in Saint Petersburg, Russia).<br>
Also I work for the &quot;Academic Project Press&quot; as an editor... as well as a journalist for few monthlies.<br>
In conclusion -- I'm a member of the Russian Union of Writers. </p>
     <p><b> Leevi Lehto<br>
     </b> &nbsp; Title of talk: <br>
     &quot;Poetry, Power, Freedom&quot;<br>
     <br>
     &nbsp; Abstract: <br>
     I'm interested in poetry as a peculiar, and possibly crucial, form of critique - i.e. of ideologies and power structures - and how this is both made possible by and requires a certain absolute freedom of content and form. This is especially important in our time - which, indeed, is that of <i>both</i> War and Banality: in the face of ready-made ideologies, poetry can offer a method of (constant, open-ended) questioning.<br>

     Title of talk: <br>
&quot;Some Words on the Subject&quot; <br>
       Abstract: </p>
     <p> This paper will be a reflection on the current state of Latin American poetry (in Spanish and Portuguese) in light of its inherited disturbances (the end of the &quot;tradition&quot; of the avant-garde and the lack of spirit, the minimal or non-existent resistance of a poetics of change) and social and historical contingency which overpowers not only poetry but all honest human expression. The talk will be interspersed with a reading of my poems. </p>
     <p> R&eacute;sum&eacute;: <br>
       Eduardo Mil&aacute;n is a poet and essayist. He is Professor of Literary Theory and Latin American Poetry at the Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana in Mexico City. He has also taught at other universities in Mexico, including UNAM, Casa Lamm, and Universidad Iberoamericana. </p>
     <p><b> Charles</b><b> Bernstein<br>
     </b> Title of talk: <br>
     &quot;Poetics of the Americas&quot; </p>
     <p> Abstract: <br>
  Taking Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;'s &quot;Our America&quot; as a starting point, an attempt to articulate North-South affinities of form and project, without losing sight of the particularity of the poetries that emerge in English, Portuguese, Spanish, French and in relation to indigenous languages. </p>

     <p><b> Yao</b><b> Feng<br>
     </b>Title of Talk: <br>
     &quot;Chinese Poetry and the Internet&quot; </p>
     <p> Abstract: <br>
       In a country like China that is making big strides towards economic globalization, poetry has ceased to play the role it traditionally did in social and cultural life, having become instead a literary practice limited to only a few people. In spite of that, poetry has never been as accessible to those people as it is now. With a greater creative freedom and the widespread use of the internet, poets can write more freely and can quickly post their works on internet sites. There are in China hundreds of sites and many &quot; civil&quot; (i.e., non-governmental) poetry magazines dedicated exclusively to poetry. Fueled by the new means of communication and by a growing openness, Chinese poetry appears vigorously alive, displaying a variety of styles and new tendencies. </p>

     &quot;The Place of the Poet and of Poetry Today&quot; </p>
     <p> Abstract: <br>
       Some reflections on the role of the poet and of poetry in a time that has been characterized by Octavio Paz as &quot;post-utopian&quot;: an entire historical cycle that began in the Romantic period seems to have come to an end, and poets and artists in general are forced give up the hyperbolic self-image that had been attributed to them in the last two centuries. </p>
