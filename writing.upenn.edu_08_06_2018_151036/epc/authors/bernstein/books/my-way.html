      <P>"Verse is born free but everywhere in chains. It has been my project to rattle 
        the chains." (from "The Revenge of the Poet-Critic") 
      <P>In My Way, (in)famous language poet and critic Charles Bernstein deploys
        a wide variety of interlinked forms--speeches and poems, interviews and
        essays--to explore the place of poetry in American culture and in the university.
        Sometimes comic, sometimes dark, Bernstein's writing is irreverent but
        always relevant, "not structurally challenged, but structurally challenging.
      <P>Addressing many interrelated issues, Bernstein moves from the role of
        the public intellectual to the poetics of scholarly prose, from vernacular
        modernism to idiosyncratic postmodernism, from identity politics to the
        resurgence of the aesthetic, from cultural studies to poetry as a performance
        art, from the small press movement to the Web. Along the way he provides
        "close listening" to such poets as Charles Reznikoff, Laura Riding, Susan
        Howe, Ezra Pound, Allen Ginsberg, and Gertrude Stein, as well as a fresh
        perspective on <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</I>, the magazine he coedited that became
        a fulcrum for a new wave of North American writing.
      <P>In his passionate defense of an activist, innovative poetry, Bernstein
        never departs from the culturally engaged, linguistically complex, yet
        often very funny writing that has characterized his unique approach to
        poetry for over twenty years. Offering some of his most daring work yet--essays
        in poetic lines, prose with poetic motifs, interviews miming speech, speeches
        veering into song--Charles Bernstein's <I>My Way</I> illuminates the newest
        developments in contemporary poetry with its own contributions to them. <BR>

        An imaginative mensch fruitfully complicates poetry. Bernstein ...
        is one of the most sophisticated readers and writers we have. And he's
        also a wag, but seriously. His alternative perspective can only rejuvenate,
        partly because he's both a teacher (SUNY-Buffalo) and a student (by temperament),
        both the critic and the criticized, earnestly engaged with and yet also
        helpfully detached from poetry and its ongoing politics. Combining commentary
        on general intellectual issues (e.g., multiculturalisms move into the academy)
        and criticism (of Ezra Pound, Charles Reznikoff, et al.) with interviews
        and even poems, which here tend to double as philosophical or aesthetic
        credos, this excellent collection could serve well either as an introduction
        for newcomers or as the latest installment, for familiars, of a continuing
        conversation with the author. For, more than is true of most literary thinkers,
        Bernstein remains a committed personalist (without downsizing the scale
        of his investigations): You hear his voice as though he were sitting beside
        you, offering an amazingly mixed bag of wise asides and sensibly contrarian
        discussions.... Bernstein's pluralism, favoring the goal of finding the
        possibilities for articulation of meanings that are too often denied or
        repressed, is in fact anything but politically correct; as a founder of
        language poetry, he has always chosen to side with outsiderhood. Its remarkable
        how much more persuasive his renegade stance now seems than that of the
        poetic mainstream. For, as Bernstein so eloquently shows and tells us,
        ``Language, along with outer space, is the last wilderness.'' (12/15/98)
      <P><B>from Rosmarie Waldrop:</B> <BR>
        This is <I>froehliche Wissenschaft</I> indeed. Turbulent, open-ended
        thought mounts a much-needed attack on sclerosis of word and mind--and
        will have you in stitches as it pits PC ('personal cappuccino') against
        the 'ideopigical,' sound poetry against unsound poetry, and the 'refractory
        insouciance of the intractable' against tone lock, frame freeze, and mediocracy.
      <P><B>from Marjorie Perloff:</B> <BR>
          <I>My Way</I> is, quite simply, one of the most brilliant, exciting
        literary books to be published in the nineties. It is unique in its imagination,
        its bite, and above all, its deadpan and dazzling wit.
      <P><B>from <I>Booklist</I>:</B> <BR>
        One of the leaders of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E school of poetry, Bernstein
        is a poetic gadly, uncompromising in his questioning of what language is,
        why we use it as we do, and what values are conveyed with our linguistic
        choices. Bernstein will make few readers comfortable; there is something
        here to irritate almost everyone, beginning with Bernstein's radical vision
        of language ... American poetry needs Bernstein to keep it radcially honest,
        and he is, playfully and annoyingly, delighted to meet that need. (--Patricia
        Monaghan, 12/15/98)
      <P><B>from Peter Straub:</B> <BR>
          <I>My Way</I> is an entirely apt, allusive, and irreverent name for
        the latest of Charles Bernstein's demonstrations that the persistent application
        of a freely responsive and inventive intelligence to the idea of the text
        and its manifold uses enlarges both literature and those who read it.
      <p><b>from Rob Wilson (via Amazon.com):</b><br>
  "My Way" offers a contrarian and Emersonian shakeup (and shakedown) of US poetics and its normative
        liberal pieties. I find these mixed-genre essays to be stimulating,energizing, dismantling, inventive,
        taking the grounds of "a poetics" into a newfoundland of play, risk, and stylistic mixture. By this, I
        mean that the prior senses of voice and forms of genre, not to mention the stabilities of "poetic
        diction," are taken into stranger post-ego areas of language risk, secular conversion, and fun. Sinatra
        did it "my way," and Charles Bernstein (like a zanier Bob Dylan watching a Marx Brothers movie while
        reading Deleuze and composing the Greenwich Village Joe Hill Blues on a used mouth harp) did it his, and
  "official verse culture" in the United States will never be the smug same old poesy again. Not for those
        whose version of pastoral is still made of petunia flowers, tylanol, and sheep.
