        <td><p><em>ALL THE WHISKEY IN HEAVEN: SELECTED   POEMS</em><br />
          By Charles Bernstein<br />
          Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $26<br />
          <br />
          Aptly depicted by John Ashbery as   &quot;a vast department store of the imagination,&quot; the long-awaited   selection of Charles Bernstein's poems, &quot;All the Whiskey in   Heaven,&quot; is a stunning display of the poet's incredible verbal   acrobatics, soaked in hilarious humor and serendipitous <br />
          wit, and anchored by   a powerful emotional undertow.<br />
          For more than three decades, Mr.   Bernstein has remained American poetry's most daring <br />
          <br />
          provocateur as well as   the genre's most articulate advocate. Today, even in the hands of its most   widely acclaimed practitioners, poetry seems decorative, superfluous,   apologetic and dispensable. It seems as if there were no better place for   poetry in contemporary culture than those window boxes in The New Yorker, or   as if it could find nothing better to do than be a <br />
          milquetoast coda to Jim   Lehrer's &quot;NewsHour.&quot;<br />
          <br />
            With Mr. Bernstein, however, poetry is   a speech act in the public arena in contention with, not as a housemaid to,   political rhetoric, commercial advertising, financial diagrams, medical   diagnostics, literary pulp and all the other genres of human language that   make up the essential parts of our life at the dawn of the new millennium.<br />
            <br />
            From &quot;Asylum&quot; (1975) to   &quot;Matter of Policy&quot; (1980), from &quot;The Lives of the Toll   Takers&quot; (1994) to &quot;Let's Just Say&quot; (2003), the poet looks at   life with a kind of whimsical humor, pleasure and sarcasm that once   characterized Benjamin Franklin's alter ego, that stalwart of American whiz   kid cum arch-sage, Poor Richard. Just as the founding father's aphoristic   wisdom laid the foundation of American culture, Mr. Bernstein, as a supreme   satirist and unrelenting critic, has been shaking loose that foundation, or   subjecting it to a poetic water-boarding.<br />
            <br />
            His recent poems, especially, have   sounded the unfathomable depths of the ground zeroes in our public and   private lives. &quot;Report from Liberty Street&quot; (2001) is a capacious,   mesmerizing symphony written in the wake of 9/11, a 21st century &quot;Leaves   of Grass&quot; of Walt Whitman and &quot;America&quot; of Allen Ginsberg.   &quot;War Stories&quot; (2006) is a powerful indictment of the destructive   forces, including our own benightedness and complicity, that roam on earth in   the sheep clothes of peace. And the book's title poem, &quot;All the Whiskey   in Heaven&quot; (2008), at once an elegy and love letter of unsurpassable   sadness, beauty and courage, is no apology for poetry but a manifesto as   timeless as those Shakespearean lines that define the apex of English poetry,   &quot;So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,/So long lives this, and   this gives life to thee.&quot;<br />
