        Biographical Note<br />
      for <i><a href="index.html">All the Whiskey in Heaven</a></i></strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Charles Bernstein was born in 1950 in Manhattan, the youngest of three children.  His father, Herman (1901?-1977), one of 11 brothers and sisters, was also born  in Manhattan.  Herman’s father, Charles, and his mother, Jenny, emigrated from Western Russia  in the 1890s, settling in the Lower East Side and then Greenwich   Village. Jenny ran a Jewish resort on the Jersey shore and later a  restaurant in lower Manhattan.  Herman worked in the garment industry and was a manufacturer of ladies’ dresses.  He married Sherry in 1945. Sherry, an only child, was born in 1921 and grew up  in Brooklyn. Her mother was born in Western  Russia; when she was seven she was sent, alone, to America to join her step-family.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br />
        Bernstein  grew up in a sometimes secular Jewish household on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He attended  the Ethical Culture School<strong>,</strong> but adapted to it poorly (as  chronicled in “Standing Target”).  He  went on to the Bronx High School of Science, graduating in 1968.  It was also in 1968 that he met visual artist  Susan Bee Laufer, whom he subsequently married, and with whom he has two  children, Emma (1985-2008) and Felix (born 1992). <br />
        During his  years at Harvard College (1968-1972), Bernstein was  active in the anti-war movement. He directed several experimental theater works  and, as a senior, started his first small press magazine. He studied philosophy  with Rogers Albritton and Stanley Cavell and wrote his undergraduate  dissertation on Ludwig Wittgenstein and Gertrude Stein. After a brief stint  near Vancouver, where he met Robin Blaser, and  was first in touch with Jerome Rothenberg and Ron Silliman, he and Susan Bee  moved to Santa Barbara  in late 1973, where he worked as a health educator for a free clinic and wrote  the minimalist poems of <em>Disfrutes</em> (published in 1981). Bernstein moved back to the Upper   West Side in 1975 and has lived there since. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br />
        In New York, Bernstein  connected with a loose circle of iconoclastic poets who were committed to  formal invention and who shared a sense of the importance of poetics as an  activist historical and ideological project. He published his first two books  with Asylum’s Press, which he started with Bee, named after his first book (1975).  In addition to the title poem, included in <i>All the Whiskey in Heaver</i>, <em>Asylums</em> included the dense imploded-syntax prose of “Lo Disfruto”  and a long list poem “My/My/My,” from which he also produced a multi-track  sound poem that was collected on the audio release <em>Class</em> (1982) . In 1976, he made a series of densely overlaid  typewriter visual poems entitled <em>Veil</em>,  which he later reworked in holographic and digital media. The full text of his  early works and visual works, as well two visual/typographic collaboration with  Bee –<em> The Occurrence of Tune</em> (1981)  and <em>The Nude Formalism</em> (1989) – are  available on-line via Bernstein’s author page  (writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bersntein).<br />
        Bruce  Andrews and Bernstein published the first issue of <em>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</em> in 1978. It ran till 1981. <em>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</em>  was a  home-made poetics periodical that brought together mostly North American poets  committed to connecting their work to radical modernist traditions,  articulating philosophical and aesthetic foundations for poetic composition,  and, overall, promoting forms of poetry and poetics that were antipathetic to  what Bernstein, in an early essay, called “Official Verse Culture.” <em>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</em> and its associated  poetry created a great deal of controversy (not to say hostility) in the  literary world, since its disruptive “aversion of conformity” went against  received ideas of voice, tone, coherence, and verse form, and implicitly  questioned the exclusive prominence given to poets taken to best represent  these received ideas. </font></p>

        In the  1970s and 1980s, Bernstein worked as a medical and healthcare writer and  editor. In 1986, at the New Poetics conference in Vancouver, he presented an early version of  what was to become <em>Artifice of Absorption</em>,  which was collected in <em>A Poetics </em>(Harvard  University Press, 1992).  This 3000 line  poem-essay contrasted absorbing and absorptive poetry with poetry of opacity  and impermeability. Bernstein argued that, like all binary oppositions, the two  terms are not aesthetic absolutes but context-dependent. <br />
        In 1990,  despite not having a graduate degree, Bernstein was appointed to the David Gray  chair at the State University of New York at Buffalo, previously held by Robert Creeley.  With Creeley, Susan Howe, Raymond Federman, and Dennis Tedlock, Bernstein started the Poetics Program and became  its Director; he was later appointed SUNY Distinguished Professor. The Poetics  Program brought an extraordinary group of young poets and scholars to Buffalo; they sought  doctoral degrees but also the chance to write, read, and publish poetry in a  charged literary community. In 1995, with Loss Pequeño Glazier, Bernstein  founded the Electronic   Poetry Center,  one of the earliest and most sophisticated models for digital poetry resources  on the web. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br />
        Bernstein  has collaborated with visual artists Susan Bee, Mimi Gross, and Richard Tuttle  on books, paintings and sculptures. In the early 1990s, he wrote three operas  with composer Ben Yarmolinsky, collected as <em>Blind  Witness: Three American Operas </em>(Factory   School, 2008). And  starting in 1999, he worked with composer Brian Ferneyhough on <em>Shadowtime</em>,  a “thought opera” in/around the work and life  of Walter Benjamin, which was published by Green Integer (2005). These libretti  are not included in <i>All the Whiskey in Heaven</i>.<br />
        In 2003,  Bernstein moved to the University   of Pennsylvania, where he  was appointed Donald T. Regan Professor of English and Comparative Literature.  At Penn, he cofounded, with Al Filreis, PennSound, a vast web-based audio  archive of poets reading their work. In 2006, Bernstein was elected a Fellow of  the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br />
        From 1974  to 2009, Bernstein  published 13 full-length collections of poetry  along with 21 additional pamphlets and artist’s books, three collections of  essays, and two books of libretti. He also has edited numerous magazine, essay,  and poetry collections. His writing has been translated into many languages and  selected works in translation have been published (or are in process) in  Brazil, France, Sweden, Finland, Yugoslavia, Mexico, Cuba, Mexico, Germany, and  China,  </font></p>
