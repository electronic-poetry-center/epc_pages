        Red, Green &amp; Black is almost (just about, quite like, virtually, similar 
        to) a translation of Cadiot's French &quot;original,&quot; with this difference: 
        its life in &quot;the American&quot; hits the &quot;target&quot; just 
        as often as in the French. Olivier Cadiot -- one of Paris' most provocative, 
        original, and funny new poets -- teams up with L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E's Charles 
        Bernstein to compose a poem noir, where it's never clear what's happening 
        or who done it -- only that a new kind of poetry from France has just 
        arrived. </p>
      <p><br>
        &quot;The game is grammatical, but the arrow hits: a real corpse decomposes. 
        Between repetition, tautology and quotation, falls dead silence. What 
        seems a sort of ready-made language (in which Charles Bernstein's playfulness 
        matches Cadiot's) turns out to be a carnival on top of `catastrophe/catastrophic'. 
        Need I add: a poem for our time?&quot;<br>
