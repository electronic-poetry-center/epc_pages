        &quot;It&#146;s strange to think of Charles Bernstein&#146;s insurrectionary 
        <i>Controlling Interests</i> as a &#147;classic,&#148; but there (here) 
        it is. Written in &amp; on that paradigmatic moment when &#147;guacamole 
        has replaced turkey as / the national dish of most favor&#148; &#150; 
        1980, three years after the oil crisis and the slippage of fordism toward 
        the modular elusiveness of post-fordist globalization &#150; these texts 
        register and report on the (local &amp; partial) displacement of the arduous 
        demands of production by the diffuse injunction to take up a &#147;lifestyle&#148; 
        and consume. But they&#146;re characterized by a sometimes savage exuberance 
        that hardly fits the Jamesonian mantra of the pomo lamb lying down complacently 
        with its late-capitalist lion. That&#146;s evident not only in the sometimes 
        overt accents of critique, but also in the pervasive madcap pleasures 
        of bizarre one-upsmanship: no mode of production could be more modular 
        and mobile than this carnival of madly compressed &#147;turnover time.&#148; 
        Indeed things move fast enough that, if this were a carousel (why not?), 
        a lot of the fixtures &amp; bric-a-brac of their historical moment would 
        go zooming off toward some asymptotic limit we might call a horizon. What 
        we can dimly discern there is surprising, and makes this hyperbolically 
        comic text also intensely moving: say Benjamin&#146;s angel of history, 
        struggling to recover blown shards of the wreckage of history (the sacred) 
        before it&#146;s too late; or some strange avatar of Thoreau (courtesy 
        of Stanley Cavell) dreaming not that the language might be made whole 
        &#150; and make us whole &#150; but that it already is (we are) if we 
        can hear it. Controlling Interests points us toward the communal space 
        articulated in those almost audible words. But it won&#146;t let us forget 
        that all of it &#150; junk and junket and critical juggernaut, and the 
        words that make and remake them &#150; is &#147;us&#148; not &#147;them.&#148; 
        So that: comedy, and empathy, and hope: arm in arm, neck &amp; neck &#150; 
        we&#146;re off!<b> --Tenney Nathanson, University of Arizona</b><br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;In the poems of CONTROLLING 
        INTERESTS Bernstein continually reveals his desire for the concomitance 
        of the individual and the world, of all language and experience . This 
        book is one of the most original and imaginative in American lyric verse&quot; 
        --<b>Douglas Messerli</b>. (<a href="../reviews/messerli.html">Go to Messerli's 
        entire 1982 review.</a>)<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Bernstein presents the reader with a world in which the articulation 
        of an individual language is all but prevented by the official discourses 
        that bombard the consciousness from all sides . He [is] on to something 
        important&quot;--<b>Marjorie Perloff</b><br>
        <br>
        &quot;It is writing of absolute necessity, demanding not to be appreciated, 
        but understood&quot;--<b>Ron Silliman</b>. </font></p>
