will never win the war on terror/But neither will error abetted
by error," is the stinging couplet Charles Bernstein drops midway
into his seriocomic tour de force "The Ballad of the Girly Man," the
poem that concludes his latest collection, "Girly Man," published
last month by the University of Chicago Press. </font></p>
</span>
<p><span class="storyText"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"> Bernstein,
who succeeded Robert Creeley as Gray Chair of Poetry and Letters
at the University at Buffalo and served for nearly a decade and
a half as director of the UB </font></span><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">poetics
program, returns to Buffalo this weekend as a participant in
UB's "On Words: A
Conference on the Life &amp; Work of Robert Creeley." At 8 Saturday,
he will join celebrated poet and former MacArthur Fellow Ann
Lauterbach in the conference's concluding reading at Trinity
Church, 371 Delaware Ave. Bernstein co-founded the groundbreaking
journal L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E in 1978 and soon emerged as the most
persuasive advocate and spokesman for what came to be known as
the "Language" movement in American poetry. In recent years he
has risen to even greater prominence as a public intellectual,
champion of formalist innovation in poetry and all the arts,
and perhaps the wittiest and most philosophically savvy of the
second-generation poets associated with the so-called "New York
School." </font></p>
<span class="storyText">
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"> Bernstein's mastery
of conceptual approaches to writing produces some compelling
ready-mades, including the stipulative "Let's Just Say" with
its harrowing last line: "Let's just say that the lie of the
mind is the light of perception." No American poet traverses
the ground between high and low culture more entertainingly either,
as demonstrated by the juxtaposition of "Language, Truth, and
Logic" (an abstract on A.J. Ayer's 1936 classic text of logical
positivism) with the hilarious "Slap Me Five, Cleo, Mark's History," which
reads like a Mel Brooks monologue on art history. </font></p>
</span>
<p><span class="storyText"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"> If there is a gradual
warming shift in tone from Bernstein's earlier, more self-consciously
experimental work, it manifests itself primarily in poems addressed
to his children and colleagues. "Castor Oil," a poem dedicated
to his daughter Emma, begins: "I went looking for my soul/In
the song of a minor bird/But I could not find it there/Only the
shadow of my thinking."</font></span></p>
