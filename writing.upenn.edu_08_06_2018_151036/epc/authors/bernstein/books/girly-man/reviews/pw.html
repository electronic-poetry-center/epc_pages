Charles Bernstein. Univ. of Chicago, $24 (160p) ISBN 0-226-04406-8 <BR>
<br>
Cofounder of the journal <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</I>, from which language
poetry takes its name, as well as the online poetics list and
the audio poetry archive PENNsound, Bernstein is also a prolific
critic and a consummate poet, as he shows again in this collection
of seven discrete chapbooklike works. After the invocational
four-poem opening of "Let's Just Say," the book moves to "Some
of These Daze," Bernstein's prose dispatches in the immediate
aftermath of 9/11, and on to the acerbic intimacies of "World
on Fire," which critiques clich&eacute;s like "what are we fighting
for?" "In Parts" takes up the serial form Bernstein perfected
in the classic <I>Islets/ Irritations</I> (1983) to examine the
pieces of "a world in which there are no narratives in which
to believe// simultaneous double negative// flop flip." A fascination
with the sloganlike rhetoric of Tin Pan Alley runs through the
collection, culminating in the title poem: "So be a girly man/ &amp; sing
this gurly song/ Sissies &amp; proud/ That we would never lie
our way to war." <I>(Sept.)</I> <BR>
