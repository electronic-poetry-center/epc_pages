<h1></h1>
<p>Charles Bernstein is a controversial poetry critic, vanguard
poet, and a leading member of a group of writers widely called "language
poets." Since 2003, he has also been the Donald T. Regan Professor
of English at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, Bernstein's passionate critical
essays, manifestos and lectures on contemporary poetry have amounted
to a direct critique of what he calls "official verse culture."</p>
<p>Among other things, Bernstein holds poetry to be "an intervention
within the culture against static forms of knowledge, against
schooled conceptions and traditional formulation."</p>
<p>Oddly, <i>Girly Man</i>, which is Bernstein's 30th collection
of poetry, is his least formally unorthodox and least elusive
book to date. It is also his most emphatic and rewarding poetry
collection so far.</p>
<p>Bernstein continues to explore modes of the satirical, political
and philosophical. He also skillfully continues to employ aphorisms
("Poetry is patterned thought in search of unpatterned mind")
and pitch-perfect one-liners ("Simply stated, there's nothing
to state"), both employing and lancing cultural cliches.</p>
<p>Still, in light of his long-standing antiformalist stance, <i>Girly
Man</i> offers a spirited change of direction. Bernstein, it
appears, is indeed charting new ground by remapping older poetic
ground.</p>
<p>In a great chain of poetic being, <i>Girly Man</i> features
doggerel, haiku, list poems, lyric poems, sonnets, satires and
translations. In addition, Bernstein also offers a tale, a meditative
poem, a confessional poem, a nursery rhyme, a dream poem, a serial
poem, a collaboration poem and a ballad.</p>
<p>So what do you do when the most adamant antiformalist poet
in America writes a book using the tried-and-true forms? Get
the book; proceed with caution; and read a master poet practicing
his cunning art in top form.</p>
<p>Let's look at the poems more closely:</p>
<p><i>Girly Man</i> includes several well-made sonnets with pop-tune
lyrics for titles: "In a Restless World Like This Is" and "Ghost
of a Chance." The poem "Don't Get Me Wrong" is bluesy and songlike:</p>
<p><i>Don't get me wrong<br>
</i><i>I'm never right<br>
</i><i>Busted up and feelin' slight<br>
</i><i>The hay's in the hayloft<br>
</i><i>My monkey's bent and sore<br>
</i><i>But still I'm mad to see you<br>
</i><i>Slumping at the door.</i></p>
<p>The collection includes a walking poem titled "Report From
Liberty Street"; a letter poem titled "Letter From New York";
and a now-classic "I do this I do that" New York School poem
about 9/11 called "It's 8:23 in New York." The last poem is stylized,
but also seems sincerely elegiac, reflecting the speaker's reactions
to the horrific events in New York, where Bernstein lives.</p>
<p>Similarly, the confessional poem "There's Beauty in the Sound
of the Rushing Brook as It Forks &amp; Bends in the Moonlight" is
earnest about its irony, and vice versa. He writes:</p>
<p><i>I've had trouble with<br>
</i><i>sincerity -<br>
</i><i>people say my<br>
</i><i>irony is static &amp; that<br>
</i><i>I can't get "with"<br>
</i><i>detail. But<br>
</i><i>I've been<br>
</i><i>doing aerobics &amp;<br>
</i><i>completed my third session<br>
</i><i>with the<br>
</i><i>chiropractor &amp; been<br>
</i><i>better in groups</i></p>
<p>In "Further Color Notes," the speaker instructs (with some
borrowed language from his wife, the painter Susan Bee): "Pg.
8, lighter and brighter overall." The poem seems to be a series
of design instructions for a book we don't have in front of us.
And since we don't have the book, we are free to imagine on several
levels at once, with moments of surprise such as the line "Pg.
20, red should be more orange."</p>
<p>Bernstein shows a keen ear for sentences in the American grain: "I'll
give you ten minutes and if you don't come out I'll give you
ten more minutes."</p>
<p>His serial poem is aptly named "In Parts," and there is "Death
Fugue (Echo)," after Paul Celan's significant and daring poem.</p>
<p>"Sign Under Test" can be classed both in the category of "postmodern
poem" and "meditative poem":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On an evening in June, alone with anxious mediations, reading
by mobbed light, I come again, taste to taste, with my own self-inoculation<i>s.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Responding
to Wordsworth's comment that poetry is "emotion
recollected in tranquillity," Bernstein writes: "I come again,
taste to taste." The poem also echoes a favorite Wordsworth metaphor
- "drinking in" - and is another example of just how layered
many of these poems can be.</p>
<p>There is a poem that appears to be Objectivist ("The Bricklayer's
Arms") and "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie," a projective verse poem (which
uses the page to score the poem chugging across its great wide-open
plains). There's a poem of philosophic investigation ("Language,
Truth, Logic") and humorous satires such as "Thank You for Saying
Thank You."</p>
<p>The title poem, "The Ballad of the Girly Man," is both a political
poem and a ballad. The poem directly responds to Arnold Schwarzenegger's
cheap-shot characterization, in 2004, of opponents of President
Bush's policies as "girly men." Bernstein writes: "So be a girly
man/ &amp; sing this gurly song/ Sissies &amp; proud/ That we
would never lie our way to war." Another stanza reads:</p>
<p><i>Thugs from hell have taken freedom's store<br>
</i><i>The rich get richer, the poor die quicker<br>
</i><i>&amp; the
only god that sanctions that<br>
</i><i>Is no god at all but rhetorical crap</i></p>
<p>I felt a charged excitement when I first heard Bernstein read
the poem in 2004, but now on the page, true as it is, it has
less of an impact for me. Ballads have deep roots in the oral
tradition, and true to form, the poem may work best on the stage
than on the page.</p>
<p>Overall, Bernstein's direct engagement of traditional poetic
forms in <i>Girly Man</i> is a major achievement. Yet a key dilemma
remains: If sincerity can be an affect, something artful and
made, where does that leave sincerity? How much is appearance
of sincerity in many of the poems here also a commentary on sincerity,
too? Questions open for fruitful thought. Anyone interested in
contemporary poetry should seek out the collection, if only to
read one of our most provocative poet-critics writing his most
engaging poems to date.</p>
