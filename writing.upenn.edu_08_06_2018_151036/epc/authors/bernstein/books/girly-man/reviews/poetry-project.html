<br><b>CHARLES BERNSTEIN </b>
<br><b><i>GIRLY MAN </i></b>
<br> UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS I 2006 
<br>REVIEW BY CHUCK STEBELTON 
<br>&nbsp; 
<br>Charles Bernstein's new volume <i>Girly Man</i>, richly furnished
in hard- 
<br>cover with a gorgeously rendered Susan Bee dust jacket, cites
the 
<br>original chapbook publication of two chapters as pamphlets
rather 
<br>than chaps. By calling them pamphlets, which call to mind
slogans, 
<br>Bernstein suggests that he intended to affect an immediate
outcome 
<br>beyond a beautiful book object or a cannonball in the gift
economy. 
<br>The individual poems take on necessarily different resonances
than 
<br>when read against the primary context in which they first
appeared. 
<br>Some take on multiple registers, others seem more muted here. 
<br>Many, thankfully, find complement elsewhere in a growing number 
<br>of sound files and critical responses on the author's EPC
page and 
<br>at Penn Sound. 
<br>&nbsp; 
<br><i>Girly Man&rsquo;s</i> opening chapter appeared with Chax
in 2003, lovingly 
<br>hand sewn with a spiffy little woodcut figure thinking a speech
bal- 
<br>loon that says, &quot;Let's Just Say.&quot; The book-ending
of first and final 
<br>pieces allow each of the four poems here to make fullest use
of the 
<br>smaller format. Both the opening poem &quot;In Particular&quot; and
the final 
<br>untitled poem &quot;every lake has a house&quot; proceeds
as a list of impos- 
<br>sibly shifting positions, each ending on an inversion of the
opening 
<br>line. In the case of &quot;In Particular,&quot; &quot;A black
man waiting at a bus stop 
<br>/ A white woman sitting on a stool&quot; cap a four page litany
of 
<br>impolitic characters and caricatures. &ldquo;A Wiccan matron
swimming in 
<br>glue. A balding brownnoser in tutu.&rdquo; The poem comes
into its own 
<br>the moment it returns to what' it first meant to dodge: &quot; A
white man 
<br>sitting on stooll A black woman waiting at bus stop.&quot; 
<br>&nbsp; 
<br>The short untitled poem &quot;every lake has a house&quot; frames
the same 
<br>trick in the shorter space of a single page. Bernstein inverts
its title 
<br>line by closing on &quot;&amp; every house has a lake.&quot; In
the process he pro- 
<br>ceeds to zoom in on that house and every house to a level
of improb- 
<br>able and even impossible detail: &quot;&amp; every face has
a thought / &amp; 
<br>every thought has a trap.&quot; Given four poems in a single
package, this 
<br>bracketing by inversion is a send up at the level of the poem
and on 
<br>the level of sequence. At the opening of this larger collection,
the 
<br>tone leading chapter &quot;Let'sJust Say&quot; wants to contain
each impulse 
<br>the rest of the collection's poems will follow or else slyly
resist. 
<br>One of the impulses in Girly Man is to have fun at the expense
of 
<br>facts that aren't logically necessary. The two part &quot;Language,
Truth, 
<br>and Logic&quot; is a hoot, insisting as always that there's
no need to be 
<br>too precious. Longer poems that resist this same impulse,
take 
<br>&quot;Likeness&quot; with its &quot;The repetition is like
the repetition,&quot; a real 
<br>groaner, can come off as mere scores. 
<br>&nbsp; 
<br>The most topical section is &quot;Some Of These Daze,&quot; composed
oflet- 
<br>ters and notes from late 2001. There's a strong sense of family
and 
<br>neighbor. Mostly comInitment and aftermath: 
<br><br>
&quot;It's a bit ominous,&quot; a friend writes, &quot;the way
the politicos are 
<br>speaking about talking with one voice.&quot; 
<br>
--I am just trying to get by talking with no voice.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp; 
<br>Other sections strike a bemused, comic 
<br>tone and document the sense of a poet very 
<br>much of his own time. &quot;He's So Heavy, 
<br>He's My Soka1l&quot; is a wry performance in 
<br>itself: &quot;I'm laughing so hard I could sigh.&quot; 
<br>Throughout Girly Man Bemstein is at play 
<br>with thinking and this leads him to coin 
<br>what could immediately become a new slo- 
<br>gan: &quot;War is the extension of prose by other 
<br>means.&quot;
