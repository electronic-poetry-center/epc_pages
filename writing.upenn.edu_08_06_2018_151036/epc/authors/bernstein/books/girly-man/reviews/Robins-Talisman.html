<b>Charles Bernstein, <i>Girly Man</i><br>
</b> University of Chicago Press, 2006. <br>
<br>
<i>Girly Man</i>, Charles Bernstein's latest assault on contemporary
life, is poetry to be read for pleasure and solace in our rather
sobering time. A collection of warnings, aphorisms, journal entries,
inverted definitions, it also includes, &quot;Some of These Daze,&quot; a
sixteen-page chronicle of life in New York City after 9/11, delineating
time, the weather, and rhythms of the streets. Before and after
this section, the poems give a conglomerate of orders, such as
Don't touch, make sense, and parade your legalease. In the wake
of 9/11, humor is a serious business. But Charles Bernstein&rsquo;s
seriousness is an uncertain business. The poems discombobulates
the reader so that she will never know/ when and where Henny
Youngman, Danny Kaye and Charles are not joking.</p>
<p>The answer to that as of a third rereading is always and never.
Meanwhile as Bernstein writes in his poem &quot;Choo, Choo, Ch
'Boogie,&quot; &quot;Refurbishment is just around the hospital
coroner.&quot; The book's assembled sections will not be pinned
down. The poem &ldquo;A flame in your heart&quot; ends &quot;for
infinite finitude: just a walk down the street / of the imaginary
enclosure that becomes real // when shared.&quot; These two poems
are from the section in <i>Girly Man</i> titled <i>World on Fire</i>.
If you have not up to now made the acquaintance of Bernstein's
postmodern lip, Charles Bernstein to date is the creator of the
movement Nude Fonnalism and more than twenty other poetry books. <i>Girly
Man</i>, according to Susan Howe on the jacket cover &quot;is
his most accessible collection.&quot; Maybe so. Meanwhile, I
miss Susan Bee's blithe images of mother goose and others that
dance through the earlier pages of his books. It seems to me
maybe the pre-9/11 poems were lighter and lither. I am not questioning
Bernstein's wit. It's not flagging here. But the earlier books
presume a kind of light-hearted indirection in some of the poems.
His cartwheels with language never reached higher. In the last
twenty-five years, Bernstein has achieved a gray eminence. He
has become the Donald T. Regan Professor of English at the University
of Pennsylvania, and his last two books, <i>My Way</i> and <i>Girly
Man</i>, bear the imprint of the University of Chicago Press.
But before allowing ourselves to be drowned in his current academic
respectability, if we examine the poems we will see Bernstein
redeem himself over and over and especially in the book's two
final poems, &quot;The Bricklayer's Arms&quot; and &quot;The
Ballad of the Girly Man,&quot; which manage to also make clear
how and why the congressional election turned out how it did
for the Democrats. This is, by the bye, not to be taken for a
complaint, Charles Bernstein manages to make his political points
via merciless wit. &quot;So be a girly man [he writes] / &amp; sing
this girly song / Sissies and Proud / That we would never lie
our way to war.&quot; </p>
