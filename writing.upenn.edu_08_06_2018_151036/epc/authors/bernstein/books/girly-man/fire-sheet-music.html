song The &quot;song [was] first introduced by another African-American
group - Harlan Leonard and his Kansas City Rockets. After Pearl

version went to no. 1 on the charts. [<a href="http://www.umkc.edu/lib/spec-col/ww2/1939/jive-txt.htm">&#8212; Kelly

<br>
I don't want to set the world on fire<br>
I just want to start<br>
A flame in your heart<br>
In my heart I have but one desire<br>
And that one is you<br>
No other will do<br>
<br>
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim<br>
I just want to be the one you love<br>
And with your admission that you feel the same<br>
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of<br>
<br>
Believe me!<br>
I don't want to set the world on fire<br>
I just want to start<br>
A flame in your heart <br>
