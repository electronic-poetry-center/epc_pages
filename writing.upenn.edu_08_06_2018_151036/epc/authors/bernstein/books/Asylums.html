<p align="center"><font color="#666666">I wrote about this book
in response to some questions posed to me by Aryanil Mukherjee,
editor of the Bengali publication <i><a href="http://www.kaurab.com">Kaurab</a>.
</i>.  My essay was published this past summer in <i>Japonchitra</i> (Kolkata,
India). Presently I am working on&nbsp; an interview with Mukherjee
for his magazine, as part of his effort to increase dialog between
American and Bengali poets. (See, for example, Mukherjee's <a href="http://kaurab.tripod.com/poetry_peripherals/mark_wallace.html">interviews</a>with Mark
Wallace and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.)  <br>

<br>
<br>
My first book of poetry, published in 1975, when I was 25, is
called <i>Asylums</i>. Susan Bee and I created our own press &ndash; Asylum&rsquo;s
Press &ndash; for the occasion, though in this first book the
press name is given on the back of the last page of the book
as Asylums Press. I have always like the association of poetry
with the press of asylum, though whether lunatic or a sanctuary
remains an open question. Over the next couple of years, we went
on to publish five other books under the imprint: Susan&rsquo;s <i>Photogram</i>,
her first artist&rsquo;s book, a fantastical reinvention of the
photogram, and four works of poetry &ndash; Peter Seaton&rsquo;s <i>Agreement</i> and
Ted Greenwald&rsquo;s <i>Use No Hooks</i>;  Ray DiPalma&rsquo;s
typewriter visual poem, <i>Marquee</i>, with an introduction
by Steve McCaffery, and my second book, <i><a href="parsing.html">Parsing</a></i>.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Asylums</i> had a lovely presstype cover,
by Susan, printed on light grey card stock, with a blank back
cover. It was 48, 8&frac12; x 11&rdquo; pages, xeroxed from the
(Remington) manual typewriter manuscript of the five poems included: &ldquo;Asylum&rdquo; (March
1975), &ldquo;Lo Disfruto&rdquo; (August-September, 1975), &ldquo;Ipe&rdquo; (March
1975) ,&ldquo;Out of This Inside&rdquo;(February-March, 1975)
and an untitled 15-page poem that consists of a continuous progression
of two-word lines, each beginning &ldquo;my&rdquo; (July 1974).
The binding was the poetry classic of the moment: sidestaple.
There is no table of contents or title page, just the typescripts
of the five poems. And there is no date given for the book publication,
though each of the poems is dated. I am not sure how many copies
I made, probably no more than 50. There is no colophon. </p>
<p align="center"> The structure of this book, a constellation
of markedly discrete works, is one I would come back to again
and again. Each poem makes its own world, each is formally and
thematically distinct from the other poems in the book &ndash; if
not an asylum than a &ldquo;republic of reality.&rdquo; The title
poem uses short clips &ndash; lines usually made up by taking
the last words of a sentence and the first words of the next &ndash; from
Erving Goffman&rsquo;s <i>Asylum</i>, a book that explored social
institutions cut-off from the outside world, from prisons to
monasteries to psychiatric wards. This poem was also one of my
first magazine publications: Ron Silliman included it in his
little magazine (also xerox and sidestapled), <i>Tottel&rsquo;s</i> in
1976. And I later included the poem in <i>Islets/Irritations </i>(1983),
the book that is perhaps the best structurally realization of
what I had in mind for <i>Asylums</i>. &ldquo;Lo Disfruto&rdquo; and
a very revised version of  &ldquo;Out of This Inside&rdquo; were
included in <i>Poetic Justice</i> (1979), a collection of prose
poems, which was subsequently included in the large collection
of books published by Sun &amp; Moon in 2000, <i>Republics of
Reality: 1975-1995</i>. &ldquo;My/my/my&rdquo; was never otherwise
published, though I did a multi-track tape realization of the
work in 1976 that was published as a part of a collection of
my audioworks called <i><a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Bernstein-Class.html">Class</a></i>&nbsp; (now
available on PennSound).</p>
<p align="center"> &ldquo;Ipe&rdquo; is the one poem from <i>Asylums</i> I
never subsequently published, even though it remains a kind of <i>ur</i> piece
for me. The 13-part serial poem is closely related to <i><a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bernstein/books/disfrutes">Disfrutes</a></i>,
written in 1974 but first published in 1981, which I have just
released this year in a web edition.
Both could be described as quasi-minimal: the poems built on
shifts and dislocations often occasioned by the change of a single
letter. </p>
<p align="center"> I was, and am, committed to the concept of
self-publishing; that writing poetry is part of a nexus of publishing
poetry, reading poetry, reviewing poetry, writing poetics, teaching
poetry. It was important to me not to just &ldquo;privately circulate&rdquo; my
manuscript &ndash; which in a sense is what I was doing &ndash; but
to publish it, to call it a finished work ready for the world,
not waiting for someone else to legitimate. Also, publishing
my own work in this way brought me directly in the economy of
exchange that has been such a central experience of doing poetry
and was a direct impetus to starting a reading series at the
Ear Inn in New York in 1978 (with Ted Greenwald) &ndash; a series
that continues on to this day, in the same Saturday afternoon
time slot, though now it is at the Bowery Poetry Club; and, also
in 1978 coediting, with Bruce Andrews, a magazine of poetics, <i><a href="http://eclipsearchive.org/eclipse/projects/LANGUAGE/language.html">L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</a></i>,
also a typewriter-and-quick-copy affair (both offset printed
and later Xeroxed). Jumping ahead to the mid-90s, these experience
were also fundamental to the connection of the Electronic Poetry
Center (writing.upenn.edu/epc), a web site on which I have worked as
editor since its founding by Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier, as
well as <a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound">PennSound, </a>
a vast archive of sound recordings, which is cofounded with Al
Filreis in 2005. </p>
<p align="center"> My advice to young poets is always: start
your own magazine or press, &amp; publish your own work and those
of your contemporaries whose poems seem most crucial for the
art. And if possible, respond as much as possible, through poetics
and reviews, to this work. Articulate its values, value its articulations.
The web certainly makes such publishing easier, but it does not
solve the hardest part, finding a community of other poets that
allows for active and intense exchange, not based just on location
or friendship or like-mindedness, but on the qualities and quiddities
of the work as it unfolds in time and space, on earth and in
the heavens of our imaginaries.</p>
