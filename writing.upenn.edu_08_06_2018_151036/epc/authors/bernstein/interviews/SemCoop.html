      <h1><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Interview with Charles 
        Bernstein </font></h1>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recently poet/critic/professor, 
        Charles Bernstein gave a reading at our store from his newest collection 
        of essays, and poems, <i>My Way</i>. Bernstein's has been a voice in experimental 
        poetry since the 1970's as one of the founders of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E and 
        is the author of over twenty books of poetry and criticism. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Seminary Co-op</b>: 
        Watching TV the other night I saw you on a commercial for the Yellow Pages. 
        This did not seem so surprising since in your autobiographical interview 
        with Loss Glazier, you cite the Manhattan Yellow Pages as one of the biggest 
        influences in your early life. What draws you to the Yellow Pages and 
        how has it informed your poetry and thinking about poetry? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Charles Bernstein</strong>: 
        In that interview, I was trying, somewhat obliquely, to contrast literary 
        works with various kinds of compendiums, dictionaries, encyclopedias, 
        cookbooks, handbooks, manuals, catalogs, and guides. I am very attracted 
        to the way these books are organized: alphabetically and also by category: 
        lists within lists. Lists, though, doesn't quite get at what's interesting 
        here, better to say arrays or constellations. Such compendiums are marvelous, 
        even magical, sources for nonnarrative and nonexpository ordering. I say 
        magical, thinking of ancient works like <em>The Greek Magical Papyri</em>, 
        which is made up of spells and potions, which themselves can be read as 
        forms of lists. These works are cornucopias of cultural particulars, both 
        utterly referential, in the sense of stranding out into the "real" world, 
        but also creating their own interior imaginative space it's that doubleness 
        I find intensely attractive. You can read the list of restaurants in the 
        Yellow Pages because you plan to go out or you can read it because you 
        plan to stay in. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: Speaking 
        of large reference volumes, in <em>My Way</em> you cite some of the failings 
        of the steady, if unspectacular large poetry anthologies (Norton, Heath, 
        etc.) that are read in introductory poetry classes. Where do they go wrong? 
        What should an introductory poetry anthology accomplish for a new reader 
        of poetry? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: Marjorie 
        Perloff gave a wonderful talk on anthologies at this year's MLA, just 
        a few weeks ago, in which she argued that as some of the new anthologies 
        are getting bigger, to include everything they feel morally obliged to 
        include, they are getting deadlier and deadlier. Anthologies are, after 
        all, largely about the dead, but the point is to bring the dead to life, 
        not to make them into stiffs. Reading poetry, reading literature, shouldn't 
        be made into an obligation when it can be a pleasure. My goal in teaching 
        is to get students to be maximally engaged with poetry, so that they continue 
        to read after they leave the class; this means I am not focused on testing 
        knowledge of a predetermined set of important facts but rather in opening 
        up a world of verbal sensations. I appreciate that some anthologies are 
        more activist than canonical, but I regret that so much of that activism 
        has a literal agenda that has resulted in the exclusion of most of the 
        formally imaginative work by the generation of poets born during and after 
        the second world war. What's important to me about poetry, I don't claim 
        it as a universal value, is not the message but the style and form and 
        structure. Poetry is not about, or anyway doesn't have to be about, moral 
        uplift or affirmation or positive sentiments about individuals or groups. 
        It isn't about using the language in correct or acceptable ways. So I 
        think too many of the general anthologies are keeping the cap on poetry, 
        hiding what is really dynamic and wild and uncontained about it, despite 
        all that they are adding in. And the sad thing is that they are doing 
        it for what they imagine to be noble reasons. Too much nobility, too little 
        art. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Co-op</b>: You 
        also criticize "official verse culture." What or who exactly do you see 
        as constituting this culture? And how does it violate what you feel poetry 
        should strive for? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: When I 
        was in Chicago a few weeks ago, just before the reading at 57th Street 
        books, I met with the European and American Avant-Garde Workshop at the 
        University of Chicago, an ongoing seminar of faculty and graduate students. 
        In the course of the afternoon, Robert von Hallberg said that he assumed 
        that when I referred to "official verse culture" I meant works that I 
        didn't consider to be poetry. He was surprised when I said that not only 
        do I consider works of official verse culture to be poetry (which is not, 
        for me, an honorific category), but also that one of the key features 
        of official verse culture was that it could necessarily include some poetry 
        that I liked quite a lot. I think Bob assumed I was invoking the old-time 
        disparaging distinction between verse and poetry, though I actually like 
        any word that has such extensions as perverse, reverse and inverse. The 
        problem with official verse culture, what makes it official, is its unreflected 
        assertion of centrality. Official verse culture's appropriation of an 
        imaginary center operates through its a series of exclusions of the bulk 
        of what is for me the most active and engaging work being done. This ends 
        up giving poetry a bad name, makes it seem a dull art for genteel readers. 
        In my original formulation of "official verse culture," in an essay on 
        William Carlos Williams published in <i>Content's Dream</i>, I list the 
        publishing and reviewing practices of a series of national magazines, 
        newspapers, and poetry organizations. In the twenty years since, I don't 
        think that the disproportion of attention and systematic exclusions that 
        I outlined there has improved. I still think the problem is the tyranny 
        of the taste of a relatively small segment of the poetry community. This 
        doesn't mean there is no value in any of our official modalities of poets 
        (my complaint has less to do with poets than institutions of poetry and 
        even the most accepted poet has her or his work reduced and diminished 
        by the grinding mill of official verse culture). Moreover, it well may 
        come to pass that some of the poetry to which I am most committed takes 
        it place as part of official verse culture. I understand, in making these 
        kind of remarks, that I open myself up to charges of being polemical and 
        partisan, for it a fundamental tactic of official verse culture to pass 
        over in utter silence what it cannot absorb while harshly dismissing structural 
        criticism of the kind I am making as ideological or fringe. Membership 
        has its privileges, including the idea that those who don't fit probably 
        don't belong and those who protest just prove the point. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: You 
        seem to feel comfortable or at least seek out the challenge of the "semiotic 
        maelstrom," i.e., the confusions and fumblings of language. And at times, 
        you argue that mainstream poetry is unwilling (to its own detriment) to 
        delve into this uncertainty. However, do you feel that many readers of 
        poetry want a sanctuary or escape from confusion, i.e., they want poetry 
        as a transformative or a distilling experience? More precisely, poetry, 
        at least in the popular imagination, is sometimes seen as an expression 
        that is apart from the commotion of everyday life. Is there any way to 
        "reposition" poetry in our culture? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: I think 
        you put the question very well. There is a tendency in the American poetry 
        world to divide up along the lines you suggest and there is some "splitting" 
        going on, each side negatively projecting onto the other. In <em>My Way</em> 
        I transform William Wordsworth's famous line "poetry is emotion recollected 
        in tranquillity" into "Poetry is tranquillity recollected in emotion, 
        commotion projected in tranquillity, recollection unsettled by turbulence." 
        But it would be foolish to suggest that turbulence or tranquillity were 
        mutually exclusive prerequisites for poetic value, since poetic values 
        are always contestable, and it is the contesting itself that is part of 
        what it is interesting. Still, you're right to suggest I want to "reposition" 
        poetry, partly by noting that the history of poetry is as much on the 
        side of turbulent thought as it is on the side of distillation. There 
        is no doubt that some readers seek out a poetry apart from the commotion 
        of everyday life and are horrified to find poetry indulging in all those 
        things poetry is supposed to rise above. But for many other readers, the 
        image of poetry as a form of refinement has made it seem the least interesting 
        of the contemporary arts and has obscured the most dynamic developments 
        within poetry. Poetry's famous obscurity is not the result of its intrinsic 
        difficulty but rather the result of the fact that what's most interesting 
        about it has been largely hidden from view. The Beats have become the 
        most popular of mid-century American poets and this is, in part, because 
        they are identified with rebellion and nonconformity and turbulence, both 
        in lifestyle and writing. The question for us now is whether that crossover 
        into popular culture is completely dependent on lifestyle or if the poems 
        can take on a life of their own, absent the celebrity of the author. I 
        think without the "oxygen of publicity," to use a phrase of Andrew Ross's, 
        a "textual" poetry will persist only on a small scale. This small scale 
        of poetry, however, is not a limitation in the negative sense, it is a 
        limit that allows the activity to thrive and to attract those readers 
        who desire the verbal intensities it alone can provide. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: In 
        a recent book about the New York School of Poets, <i>The Last Avant-Garde,</i> 
        David Lehman suggests that this was the last true avant-garde movement 
        in poetry and the possibility for a new one springing up in today's postmodern 
        world is unlikely (after all, goes the argument, we've seen it all). What 
        do you think of the potential for the creation of a "new" poetry? With 
        the presence and possibilities for experimental poetry on the internet, 
        could cyberspace be the place for the next avant-garde? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: I thought 
        this meant the last avant-garde that David Lehman had written a book about, 
        last in the sense of most recent to be noticed by him. The last one until 
        the next one. I supposed there would be a series, just like one year's 
        "best" is replaced the next year's "best" (and perhaps they are not the 
        best at all). The new isn't going anywhere because despite our best efforts 
        to the contrary the ground is constantly shifting under us. I expect poets 
        will respond to changing conditions by writing work that reads differently 
        and that means differently. The new digital writing space can be expected 
        to have a profound effect on writing and on the distribution of writing. 
        Poetry continues to be a crucial site to probe the possibilities of this 
        new medium. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: Can 
        poetry on the internet bring new readers into the fold or will it be more 
        important for its ability to bring together people already interested 
        in experimental poetry? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: Both. 
        The Internet is already crucial as a means of getting word out about books, 
        magazines, readings, and conferences; as a means to distribute small press 
        publications; and as a place for discussion. At the same time, more of 
        more poetry magazines are originating as web publications, because poetry 
        publications will seek out the cheapest possible means of reproduction 
        and distribution. That was true of mimeo and xerox in the 60s, 70s, and 
        80s, and it is true of the web right now. On this subject, let me also 
        recommend a terrific book that documents the history of small press poetry 
        magazines: <i>Secret Location on the Lower East Side: Adventures in Writing, 
        1960-1980: A Sourcebook of Information</i> by Steven Clay and Rodney Phillips. 
        At the present time, there are lots of potential readers cruising the 
        web for "content" who are visiting these poetry sites but who would not 
        read print versions of the same material: so these are the new readers 
        you are asking about. At this point, poetry is one of the leading "contents" 
        on the web; but as the web becomes more and more commercial, poetry's 
        web profile will diminish. The best sense I can give you about poetry 
        on the web is to direct you to the Electronic Poetry Center, which was 
        created by Loss Pequeno Glazier and of which I am a cofounder. We are 
        now getting about one million "hits" (requests for files) each year, which 
        is phenomenal. One key thing we are doing at the EPC is curating the space. 
        As the world wide web gets wider, editing becomes the crucial ingredient. 
        As editors, we stand behind all the material and links we have on the 
        site. Machines don't solve problems, they create new problems. Those familiar 
        with e-mail discussion groups will be aware of how destructive and also 
        pervasive "flaming" can be. The more open the Internet environment, the 
        easier it is to abuse and the harder to maintain forums for dialogue and 
        exchange. Despite the automation provided by computers, it's the labor-intensive 
        work based on aesthetic and social judgments that is making poetry sites 
        on the web indispensable. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: And 
        now for a self-interested question: As an employee of an independent bookstore 
        the rise of the superstores and Amazon.com has caused a fair amount of 
        anxiety. Should readers of experimental or contemporary poetry be equally 
        anxious about this? Or does the presence of a (friendly?) behemoth like 
        Amazon.com make available works that for many are very difficult to get? 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: Writers 
        who work with small and independent presses and magazines share a common 
        interest with independent book stores. Such book stores are crucial for 
        our survival and should, in my judgment, be supported in every way possible. 
        At minimum, this means buying books from such stores and not from the 
        large chains. Computer book buying is convenient, but there are a number 
        of independent book stores who sell books over the web or by e-mail. Even 
        if purchasing books from the independents may be slightly less convenient, 
        ensuring that these stores stay in business is worth any effort necessary. 
        Without them, the circulation of independently produced literary work 
        would be seriously hurt, as would the circulation of university press 
        titles and other books that have limited print runs and negligible advertising 
        dollars . . . . a bookstore stocked with hard-to-find and noncommercial 
        books and magazines is as vital a cultural space as any university library 
        or museum. It is the unregulated, or anyway not strictly commercial, nature 
        of the best independent bookstores that makes them crucial sites for reading 
        as an adventure in thought and a place for discovery. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: I know 
        you recently attended the MLA meeting in San Francisco. In <em>My Way</em> 
        you devote several articles to the state of American academia and the 
        "frame lock" or rigidness of English professors and departments. After 
        spending a few days surrounded by professors and academicians do feel 
        things are changing? If not what needs to be done? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: The biggest 
        problem in the university is the move away from full-time tenured faculty 
        to part-time, adjunct teachers. This represents a historically disturbing 
        shift away from the postwar promise of making a high quality liberal arts 
        college education available to all. There seems no longer the political 
        will to spend the money on faculty and students and facilities to make 
        this democratic ideal a reality. The defunding of the university will 
        have negative consequences not only for the possibilities of a democratic 
        society made up of informed citizens but also for the economic future 
        of the U.S. But the idea that a liberal arts education, and by that I 
        mean to emphasize an education in the arts, has a social or economic value, 
        has been hit very hard over the past two decades and this view needs to 
        be vociferously contested. As to the literary academy, I am not a believer 
        in models of improvement. I think we're lucky just to keep some space 
        open for change. I think it is amazing that in the postmodern university 
        it is possible to teach poetry and poetics at all, much less with the 
        perspective on the subject I bring to it. "Frame Lock" is still very much 
        in place but at least the MLA and other university forums support such 
        critiques as these, even if the academic journals remain committed to 
        a fairly standardized form of professional writing. I do sense a returning 
        interest in the "aesthetic" and in art practices; I hope this is the case. 
        There is a piece I wrote on this subject after the essays collected in 
        <em>My Way</em>. It's called "A Blow Is like an Instrument" (the title 
        is after a line from Lenny Bruce's "Shorty Petterstein Interview") and 
        is was published in a special issue of <em>Deadulus</em> on "The American 
        Academic Profession" (126:4, Fall 1997). </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: You 
        have achieved prominence as critic, poet, and academic. Do these three 
        roles ever conflict with one another? In what ways do they interrelate? 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: Conflict 
        is the material I work as a poet, essayist, and teacher. They interrelate, 
        or not, as you make them, as the various pieces of a poem can be made 
        to interrelate. In a sense, the organization of <em>My Way</em>, composed 
        as it is of so many visibly and stylistically different types of writing, 
        is meant to play out an answer to that last question, but of course it 
        doesn't play out an answer, it just hums a bunch of tunes. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: You 
        recently edited a collected volume on the poetry readings, performance 
        poetry, and audio-texts (<i>Close Listening)</i>. How does this "aural" 
        (and often overlooked) aspect of poetry effect your work? What do you 
        make of the recent resurgence of poetry readings and slams as well as 
        the possibility for spoken-word poetry on the web? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: <em>Close 
        Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word</em> addresses just this problem. 
        Surprisingly, it is the first book to comprehensively address the history 
        and significance of the poetry reading. In my introduction to the collection, 
        I argue that the poem in performance is not secondary to the written text 
        but equally important. There is an online interview I did with Dana Luther 
        on this book, so perhaps I can just direct you there (there are two parts): 
        http://www.novalearn.com/wol/archives/dana7.htm <br>
        http://www.novalearn.com/wol/archives/dana8.htm </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CO-OP</b>: You 
        also wrote the introduction to <i>Figuring the Word </i>a new collection 
        of essays and works by Johanna Drucker, a prominent book artist and poet. 
        What is the importance of the visual layout of a poem effects the linguistic 
        meaning of the poem? </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CB</b>: This connects 
        up to one of the essays in <em>My Way</em>, which is, in part, a response 
        to Johanna Drucker's work. In that piece "The Response as Such" I wrote: 
        "There are, it seems to me, two domains of poetry that are insufficiently 
        recognized, too little attended to: the sound and the look. This is another 
        way of saying that poetry is too little attended to: sounds too quickly 
        converted to words or images, the material space of the page too quickly 
        supplanted by the ideational space of the text (as if MLA really meant 
        'muted language association'). Too often, reading habits enforce a kind 
        of blindness to the particular graphic choices of type, leading, page 
        dimension, and paper, under the regime of a lexical transcendentalism 
        that accords no semantic value to the visual representation of language. 
        The poetic response to this derealization of poetry is to insist, against 
        all odds, that a work can be composed whose semantic inhabitations are 
        all visual" or, I should add, all sound (without words). Drucker has done 
        an enormous amount to explore not only the possibilities for making words 
        visible, in her artist's books, but also for investigating the meanings 
        of language visibility, in such books at <i>The Visible Word: Experimental 
        Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923</i> and her new book, <em>Figuring 
        the Word: Essays on Books, Writing, and Visual Poetics</em>. I also want 
        to mention a series of collaborations I have done with the artist Susan 
        Bee: <em>The Occurrence of Tune</em> (Segue, 1981); <em>Fool's Gold</em> 
        (Chax Press, 1991, o/p); <em>The Nude Formalism</em> (Sun &amp; Moon, 
        1989); <em>Little Orphan Anagram</em>, a limited edition, hand painted 
        book (Granary Books, 1987); and most recently, and most easily available, 
        <em>Log Rhythms</em> (Granary Books, 1998). </font></p>
