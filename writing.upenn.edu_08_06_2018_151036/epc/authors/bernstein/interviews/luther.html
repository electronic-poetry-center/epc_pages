      <p><b>My, What Sharp Ears You Have!</b></p>
      <p>by Dana Luther</p>
      <p><i>Originally published on “Writers-on-Line,” a web site, in July and 
        August 1998, based on transcripts of a phone interview. </i></p>
      <p>Did the fact that April was National Poetry Month escape you? If you 
        knew and paid attention, you might have received a number of conflicting 
        messages from the media, none of which painted a clear or realistic impression 
        of what poetry is and how it functions in current culture. Either there's 
        not a lot out there you'd want to read because it's all of a type, or 
        there's a lot out there you'd like to read but can't understand, or there's 
        a sudden resurgence of both poetry texts and public poetry readings.</p>
      <p>All are barely more than half-truths. Charles Bernstein, editor of <i>Close 
        Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word,</i> is quick to dispel the many 
        fairy tales the public is told about the definitions and functions of 
        poetry.  Active in multiple poetry performance arenas, with twenty books 
        of poetry to his credit, Bernstein is David Gray Professor of Poetry and 
        Letters in the SUNY-Buffalo Poetics Program. He is one of the originators, 
        and Executive Editor, of The Electronic Poetry Center, as well as host 
        and co-producer of the LINEbreak Poetry Radio series, available in RealAudio.</p>
      <p><i>Close Listening</i> is the first critical volume exclusively devoted 
        to exploring the practice of poetry as performance art. In forms that 
        make them creative works themselves, seventeen essays by poets and poet-scholars 
        address the acoustic and visual aspects that make performance poetry significant. 
        They effectively enrich the ways performance poets and their audiences 
        can &quot;attune&quot; to the sounded and visualized word.</p>
      <p>To venture into <i>Close Listenin</i>g<i>s</i> is to quickly revise such 
        questions as, &quot;If you want to read in public, what kind of skills 
        and material make the process fulfilling?” From the book’s perspective, 
        this is the wrong question. It would be better to ask, “What makes a good 
        audience in order to get the most out of literary performance, and how 
        can performers and listeners better <i>attend</i> to the work?” The burden 
        shifts to the listener, and the definition of  “poem” is allowed to drop 
        its expected association with text.</p>
      <p><i>Close Listening</i> is oddly revolutionary;  it's tempting to ask 
        why such a collection hasn't been published before. In an interview, Bernstein 
        offered clear opinions about media perceptions of poetry, as well as about 
        the significance of poetry readings and the concept of &quot;good&quot; 
        and &quot;bad&quot; craft. He also had advice for poet-performers.</p>
      <p><i>DANA LUTHER: Why do mainstream media neglect poetry? For instance, 
        why wasn't there much about National Poetry Month?</i></p>
      <p>CHARLES BERNSTEIN: The whole issue of having a National Poetry Month 
        is itself an indication of a problem. A lot of the promotions around national 
        poetry month tend to be feature and “soft” stories, human interest stories 
        which I think have little to do with the activity of writing and reading 
        poetry for those most involved with it. These promotions don’t really 
        promote an active and sustained engagement with poetry.</p>
      <p><i>What could change that?</i></p>
      <p>Ultimately, poetry at its most vital can’t rely upon national media attention 
        or wait for a response that is simply not likely to happen, given that 
        poetry's not a commercial proposition. The alternative is what’s been 
        going on for some time, which is the organization of poetry readings by 
        poets and editors, publication of the work by small and independent presses 
        and magazines, resourceful distribution systems like Small Press Distribution, 
        a network of committed independent book sellers, and the exchange of information 
        between and among poets and readers in self-sustaining communities.</p>
      <p><i>How can technology boost the exchange?</i></p>
      <p>Right now the internet provides a very important tool for distribution, 
        not simply  distribution of the work, though that’s an attractive aspect 
        of it -- that you can read material and also hear sound online -- but 
        also for the promotion of books, magazines and reading series. The potential 
        of electronic mailing lists of people nationally who might want to hear 
        about a book that you like or that you've published is enormously useful.</p>
      <p>Poetry tends toward the least line of resistance. That is to say, poetry 
        is very responsive to technology because in the economic (or anti-economic) 
        spectrum in which we work, one is always looking for ways to do it at 
        the least cost with the maximum exchange. In the 60’s and 70’s, mimeo, 
        photocopy and side-staple publications abounded. At the present time the 
        cheapest way to disseminate work is through electronic distribution and 
        poetry readings. A lot of the poetry on the web is better, certainly comparably 
        better, than work in the other arts because poets are putting up their 
        work somewhat more freely and comprehensively, or maybe you could say 
        with more sense of necessity. In a way, these sites are better than many 
        others because they’re not commercial. The sites are not about selling 
        something else. They’re about what they’re providing -- ends in themselves</p>
      <p><i>Is that why now is the time for </i>Close Listening<i>?</i></p>
      <p>The value of a book like this is that is doesn’t attempt to do anything 
        other than what a poem does: the impulse of these poet-scholars and scholar-critics 
        is to extend their thinking about what they do, their obsession in life 
        -- writing poetry and reading poetry. Their activity is not necessarily 
        involved with evaluation, promotion or even explanation; it's an activity 
        that's valued in and of itself and for the possibilities for exchange 
        that it provides.</p>
      <p>I think that to the extent this book is a product of its time, it has 
        to do with a set of sometimes conflicting interests converging at this 
        moment. It also has to do with a willingness to accept a range of open-ended 
        exploration and investigation of poetics that are much less rigidly determined. 
        That's something that poets of the last 20 years have been very insistent 
        on – a more imaginative, open-ended style of creative essay writing, essay 
        writing that isn’t completely expository, that isn’t completely rationalized.</p>
      <p><i>Why is the notion of a &quot;resurgence&quot; of poetry readings misguided?</i></p>
      <p><i>Close Listening </i> is, to a large extent, about poetry reading, 
        but also the visual performance of poetry. I think the current resurgence 
        of attention to poetry readings is great, but I would emphasize that poetry 
        performances go back further than written forms of poetry. So we’re not 
        talking about something new, but actually something very old. Nonetheless, 
        within critical and scholarly approaches to poetry, there had been an 
        idea that the written text was the gold standard of the poem -- it was 
        the full embodiment of the poem -- and that performances were secondary, 
        that they were illustrations.</p>
      <p>The idea that poetry should be read out loud to be understood has never 
        entirely gone out of favor. Many people think that we are now in a &quot;heyday&quot; 
        for performance poetry, but that has partly to do with the kind of  “fuzzy” 
        feature attention that poetry performances receive in newspapers. Generalized 
        articles about performance poetry usually don’t talk about individual 
        poets’ works or performances, but talk about a &quot;social phenomenon.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>You don’t have a discussion of a classical music concert by saying, “It 
        was interesting -- all these people got up with their instruments and 
        it’s a wonderful thing. They seem to gather every Friday night at Lincoln 
        Center to hear each other play, and the audience claps and seems very 
        enthusiastic. They’re playing things like violins . . .” Poetry readings 
        are treated not so much as an art activity or an aesthetic activity, but 
        primarily as a social activity.</p>
      <p><i>What’s the major value of poetry performance, and how do readings 
        differ from other literary genres?</i></p>
      <p>Poetry operates on a small scale. Poetry readings are intimate occasions; 
        they don't take place in stadiums. They don't have long runs. This intimacy 
        of scale is poetry’s great value in this society, because it offers possibilities 
        that are not available in mass-culture. Not that poetry's better than 
        mass culture, not that it replaces it, but that it's different, and that 
        the possibilities that it does offer are fundamental. To have a culture 
        operate at its best, or even to operate functionally, we can't do without 
        the possibilities poetry offers.</p>
      <p>Poetry performance brings into concrete realization the dimension of 
        language itself: the languageness of language, the wordness of language, 
        the acoustic quality of language, that which exists only in and as language. 
        It's a dimension in which the language, the sound, and the particular 
        words in the particular order are <i>not</i> dispensable.</p>
      <p>This indispensable quality, this feature of the medium of verbal language 
        itself, is something that's a fundamental value for a culture that tends 
        to treat these features as insignificant. This culture tends to think 
        of language and its forms as being disposable in some way -- as we seek 
        some truth in content, or some truth in message, or some truth in image, 
        or some truth in the meaning understood as being <i>separable</i> from 
        the way in which the meaning is created. Poetry puts us back in touch 
        with the ways in which meaning is generated and the musicality, the aesthetic 
        pleasure, of this medium. It considers language as having primary value 
        within this constrained context of the poem, of the poetry reading. I 
        wouldn't call it a &quot;moral&quot; value, but I would say there's a 
        political value to it, an ethical value.</p>
      <p><i>How can poetr</i>y<i> readings benefit the public audience?</i></p>
      <p>A large part of the U.S. population reads. A very small part of those 
        readers read poetry. People who are unfamiliar with reading poetry at 
        all often are inclined to think that poetry is difficult, or incomprehensible, 
        or  -- and I think this is the much more damaging assumption -- uninteresting. 
        Not because they might not be interested in a poem, but perhaps when they 
        look at the poem for the first time they have no information about how 
        they are to read the poem differently from how they read an issue of <i>Time 
        Magazine</i> or a popular novel.</p>
      <p>People can easily go through their whole lives without any basic orientation 
        to reading poetry. Poetry readings are particularly good crash courses 
        in listening to poetry, because after being forced to sit through several 
        readings, all of a sudden a lot of the ideas we are discussing will come 
        to you on your own. But people reading the page often won't get beyond 
        the poem, they won't read through the whole thing, they won't see what 
        the shape is, or pick up on the value of the sound. Never having considered 
        that sound had any value at all, they won't be used to listening or to 
        reading out loud. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately the way some of the promoters of poetry (around National 
        Poetry Month) want to address this issue of readers' unfamiliarity with 
        poetry is to promote and present poetry which is the most like the reading 
        experiences that readers usually get from reading large circulation magazines, 
        newspapers and popular novels. They present watered-down versions of the 
        popular materials that the readers are familiar with, but are <i>less 
        interesting</i> than those things. People may understand the poem, because 
        this “diminished capacity” poem doesn’t require any reading resources 
        that they are not using normally, but it likely to be less interesting 
        than the mass culture items with which it is trying to compete.</p>
      <p>What's interesting about poetry is the ways in which it's <i>not like 
        </i>other forms of writing. I think in general, the whole conception of 
        &quot;accessibility&quot; is misguided. Very often what's being presented 
        is . . . something that's no longer interesting as poetry. It's the least 
        like poetry that it can be, and then it loses the readers that are actually 
        looking for that which is specific to poetry that isn't available elsewhere.</p>
      <p>To offer anything less is valueless, because it merely <i>looks</i> like 
        poem. So then what's the point? Is there something wrong with TV and movies, 
        pop songs, non-fiction literature? The mass media has plenty of great 
        and engaging works to offer. It would be as if, in order to attract people 
        to read non-fiction literature, one presented it in light, free verse! 
        Why would you want to read it that way? Let people read nonfiction as 
        what <i>it</i> is, and poetry as what <i>it</i> is. They can't be conflated 
        quite in the way as those who would promote &quot;accessibility&quot; 
        as a kind of a ramp for the handicapped would want. Poetry is accessible, 
        it is auditable, it can be heard. It just requires throwing yourself into 
        it and becoming engaged with it as a complex, developed art form that's 
        quite sophisticated. </p>
      <p><i>If you think of poetry as a call-and-response form, are you asking 
        people to help themselves develop a new kind of response?</i></p>
      <p>Right, that's the whole idea of poetry in the late twentieth century. 
        Poetry is an activity that allows us to interrogate language and meaning. 
        What's interesting about it is that it's not popular culture, as such. 
        It's certainly not mass media as such. Many people interpret that to mean, 
        &quot;it's better,&quot; or &quot;it's elitist.&quot; But of course it's 
        popular culture and mass culture that tend to be elitist, because they 
        argue that only those things that get the biggest ratings are finally 
        worthwhile. The things that have lesser ratings or lesser interest scale 
        are valueless.</p>
      <p><i>How does poetry performance differ from other literary genres?</i></p>
      <p>People can and will get very excited about poetry at its <i>most</i> 
        complex, at its <i>most</i> difficult, in ways that it's <i>most</i> <i>unlike</i> 
        other kinds of reading because you can get kinds of language and acoustic 
        experiences that you can't get in other modes of writing. It's those things 
        that ultimately attract the die-hard poetry audience, which is very intense 
        and very committed. That's really what poetry has to offer.</p>
      <p>Without getting into too complex a way of explaining it, it has to do 
        with improvisation. The poetry reading presents so many different kinds 
        of significant experience that are often contradictory, that it makes 
        it harder to think of a poem as a fixed, static thing with a limited series 
        of features associated with it. The poetry reading introduces a number 
        of additional elements that also shift over time, and may not even be 
        consistent in the one performance.</p>
      <p>In multiple performances of the poem, combined with the multiple dynamics 
        of each performance (intonation, volume, timbre, the social environment 
        in which the poem is being introduced, the non-verbal body language of 
        the performer), and combined with the text of the poem, there are more 
        elements than can actually be brought into a single rationalized description. 
        The poem in this multi-version sense exceeds any single scheme for understanding 
        what it means or what it is.</p>
      <p><i>Would you explain your</i> term<i>, &quot;animalady&quot;?</i></p>
      <p>The &quot;animalady&quot; of poetry is the sensorial, bodily dimension, 
        the way in which language is exchanged in terms of the acoustic. The actual 
        physical sound of the exchange is related to meaning. The meaning is not 
        something that exists in an idealized way that <i>doesn't</i> have to 
        do with the bodies that produce it and the bodies that hear it. This is 
        a limitation: so my &quot;malady&quot; has to do with our “condition,”  
        the limitation that we're inside. We <i>can't</i> get outside of it; though 
        we can idealize language to imagine it has meanings that exist outside 
        these physical boundaries. Of course, much contemporary  philosophy will 
        also criticize the idea that there are transcendental meanings, but in 
        doing that, such philosophy often doesn't fully recognize the significance 
        of the media that we use for poetry: the visual representation of the 
        language and the acoustic sound of the language.</p>
      <p><i>In your Introduction, you speak of  &quot;the poetry reading as a 
        public tuning.&quot; By this do you mean a sounding board for the continuous 
        evolution of a work?</i></p>
      <p>Right. I meant that in one sense in a <i>technical</i> way. When you 
        think about a poem existing in a <i>primary</i> way in a reading, in a 
        performance, as opposed to on the page, then certain kinds of prosodic 
        and rhythmic possibilities, timbre and intonation, present themselves 
        which are not possible on the page. You can shift or keep constant how 
        fast you read, vary the quality of your voice. So one way in which the 
        work actually comes into tune, so that people can hear what these performative 
        patterns might be, is in the poetry reading. When people hear a poet read, 
        they become attuned to the kinds of sounds that that person is producing, 
        which may not be apparent in the printed text of the poem.</p>
      <p>Performance affords the poet the opportunity to tune herself or himself 
        up, to hear how her or his work may sound, just as musicians don’t just 
        think about how something sounds, but try it out and often try it out 
        in public, where they can improvise, get tuned in and up to create the 
        sound that they want. So it’s a tuning both for the performer and for 
        the reader.</p>
      <p>And I also mean &quot;tuning&quot; to emphasize the improvisatory quality 
        of poetry readings over and against the idea that a poem is a fixed, stable 
        thing. You <i>write</i> the poem, and it may seem to become this absolutely 
        immutable, static thing on a page. At a poetry performance <i>nobody</i> 
        imagines it that way. Everybody reads their poems a little bit differently 
        each time: the people who are present change the way you feel; or you 
        hear the poem in a different way depending on your mood, the people you’re 
        with, the physical space, and so on. So that mutability, and the improvisatory 
        quality that underlies poetry performance, could be thought of as a tuning. 
        Trying things out, exploring and in this way creating. So the process 
        of tuning becomes what the activity of poetry is. The activity of poetry 
        is not just producing these objects on a page, though that’s part of it 
        of  course. But there is also this tuning in public before other people 
        and with other people, which is a very different kind of exchange than 
        print culture allows.</p>
      <p><i>Are &quot;success&quot; and judgment irrelevant in a living process 
        that isn't goal oriented? What makes a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; 
        reading?</i></p>
      <p>I think that there isn't a right way to read a poem, or a &quot;better&quot; 
        or &quot;worse&quot; way to read a poem, any more than there's a &quot;better&quot; 
        or &quot;worse&quot; way to write a poem. But the reading, the performance, 
        is an <i>extension</i> of what the poem is, and vice-versa (the writing 
        of the poem is an extension of what you're doing in the performance of 
        it). Different poems will demand different kinds of vocalization, and 
        in respect to the quality of poetry, very often poets dislike actors reading 
        poems, because they read them too well. It's hard to explain why that 
        is, but it's a common dislike.</p>
      <p><i>What advice would you give poets who </i>want to get involved in performance?</p>
      <p>It's not only important to give poetry readings but also to organize 
        poetry readings, to recognize that organizing a poetry reading series 
        is as important as editing a magazine. Or for that matter, to review poetry 
        readings as well as poetry books. Or review the way in which a person 
        reads their work in the context of also reviewing a publication of their 
        work. Don't leave out the performance dimension when you imagine what 
        the work of a poet is in those contexts of criticism.</p>
      <p>So,  yes, it’s important to take every opportunity you can to read your 
        work out loud, to do performances of your work, not just once in a blue 
        moon, but as a frequent part of your work as a poet. Just as you might 
        seek to publish poems in a number of magazines, or publish many books, 
        it's also good to have many chances to read.</p>
      <p>Then, take those readings that you do as being <i>as significant as the 
        publication</i> of the work in print media. That would mean, for example, 
        rehearsing your work. Making a tape of your reading and listening back 
        to it and possibly &quot;scoring&quot; the page with different ideas you 
        have as you listen to it. You could be faster here, slower there, leave 
        a pause here. </p>
      <p>Also, listen to the tape of your reading in different situations. Not 
        just where that's the only thing going on, but while you're washing the 
        dishes or walking in the street, or exercising, or on the subway or a 
        bus, so that you don't focus just on the <i>poem</i> from beginning to 
        end, but hear it more as ambient sound. Then, so far as you can focus 
        on the reading as ambient sound, pick up on dimensions of the performance 
        that you wouldn't get if you were just focused on the main message of 
        the poem.</p>
      <p><i>So you think it's important to approach this as a continuous process 
        rather than allowing yourself to get into a single habit of reading?</i></p>
      <p>Right. Continue to rethink for each reading the way in which you read, 
        and not to assume that the way you read once should be repeated. Try out 
        different styles, different rhythms and so on, and don't assume that you 
        automatically know how to read every kind of poem. Try out performance 
        dynamics that might seem to be contrary to what the poem would lend itself 
        to, to try to provide some tension or contrast. There's no direct system 
        for reading a poem that was written on the page. In a performance, you're 
        adding things. So you have to come to the same kinds of decisions that 
        you make in writing the poem itself. You may think that you don't need 
        to make those decisions because you're relying on certain habitual patterns 
        of how people read or how things should be read. But you should try out 
        several ways. Don't go with the first thing or what seems the most obvious 
        to you.</p>
      <p>Then, keep re-rehearsing and rethinking what the performance is and what 
        the possibilities for your work are through your life as a poet. By performance, 
        I don't mean a highly theatrical, loud, demonstrative reading at all. 
        I think one of the things you realize when you listen to a tape and attend 
        closely to how you read is that often the &quot;chamber music&quot; side 
        of poetry is more intensely appealing than anything else. Often, being 
        low-key has great value. You can read in a very introverted way and still 
        have that work, if you intend it to be introverted. If your quietness 
        is the result of nervousness, and never thinking it through, it doesn’t 
        come off that well. But if it's actually an intense thing that you're 
        articulating -- that has to do with the music of the work -- that can 
        be just right.</p>
      <p>When people come to poetry readings, they're not expecting to be at rock 
        and roll concerts and can be put off by outrageous, over-the-top readings. 
        So by &quot;performance,&quot; I don't mean revving up. Often you can 
        be more subtle.</p>
      <p><i>Can this also persuade an audience to attend more to the language?</i></p>
      <p>Yes, it may <i>allow</i> the audience to attend. Often poetry readings 
        are a kind of sensory deprivation for people who are used to more theatrical 
        kinds of performances. There's a sense of poetry reading as &quot;poor 
        theater.&quot; But a poor theater, low-tech performance is no less fully 
        realized as a performance than a high-tech, multimedia performance. It's 
        not something that is done because you can't do anything else; it's something 
        that can be done because this is the sound you want to hear.</p>
      <p>The more, of course, you rehearse and read, the more comfortable you 
        are in the space of the poetry reading, the more you are able to play 
        around, to improvise, and to understand that the reading's its own kind 
        of space. When you're doing a poetry reading you can have almost the experience 
        of being at home writing in a notebook. You're creating the sound as you 
        go along. If you're not  too self-conscious about the script, you can’t 
        focus on the actual work of producing the sound.</p>
      <p>Also, try listening to other people reading. Pay attention to the different 
        styles of readings. Listen to tapes of historical poetry readings and 
        poetry readings that you would not be able to attend locally. Consider 
        the possibilities and become immersed in the performance of poetry as 
        much as you are in the reading of poetry on the page. </p>
