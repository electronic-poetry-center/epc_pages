      <p>As for Flarf, I'll give you as much stuff as I have in the way of statements. 
        First, here's what Kasey [<a href="http://limetree.typepad.com">K. Silem 
        Mohammad</a>] and Gary Sullivan have written on the origins of Flarf: 
      </p>
      <p> KASEY: Flarf came about a couple of years ago when Gary Sullivan submitted 
        a deliberately bad poem to Poetry.com, one of those vanity companies that 
        lures the unsuspecting with lavish praise of their poetry and then offers 
        to &quot;publish&quot; it for an exorbitant fee. Theorizing that no submission, 
        no matter how heinous, would ever be treated with anything other than 
        solicitous fawning, he sent in a poem titled &quot;Mm-hmm&quot;:</p>
      <p> Yeah, mm-hmm, it's true<br>
        big birds make <br>
        big doo! I got fire inside<br>
        my &quot;huppa&quot;-chimp(TM)<br>
        gonna be agreessive, greasy aw yeah god<br>
        wanna DOOT! DOOT!<br>
        Pffffffffffffffffffffffffft! hey!<br>
        oooh yeah baby gonna shake &amp; bake then take<br>
        AWWWWWL your monee, honee (tee hee)<br>
        uggah duggah buggah biggah buggah muggah<br>
        hey! hey! you stoopid Mick! get<br>
        off the paddy field and git<br>
        me some chocolate Quik<br>
        put a Q-tip in it and stir it up sick<br>
        pocka-mocka-chocka-locka-DING DONG<br>
        fuck! shit! piss! oh it's so sad that<br>
        syndrome what's it called tourette's<br>
        make me HAI-EE! shout out loud<br>
        Cuz I love thee. Thank you God, for listening!</p>
      <p>Sure enough, he received a full invitation to have his timeless piece 
        of literature enshrined for all posterity, etc.</p>
      <p>Gary shared his poem, the style of which he promptly dubbed &quot;Flarf,&quot; 
        with members of the Subpoetics mailing list, and before long a few other 
        participants began posting poems to Poetry.com, including myself, Drew 
        Gardner, Jordan Davis, and a handful of others. Eventually, we formed 
        a separate mailing list.</p>
      <p>The initial aesthetics of Flarf went largely unarticulated, but they 
        can probably be approximated by the following recipe: deliberate shapelessness 
        of content, form, spelling, and thought in general, with liberal borrowing 
        from internet chat-room drivel and spam scripts, often with the intention 
        of achieving a studied blend of the offensive, the sentimental, and the 
        infantile.</p>
      <p>Flarf has largely become stylized out of existence, made inseparable 
        from the usual writing habits of its practitioners, as Gary and Nada and 
        others have pointed out.</p>
      <p>Maybe the problem was ever announcing &quot;Flarf&quot; as a concept, 
        suggestive of a movement, etc., in the first place. There were those among 
        us who shrewdly warned about the dangers of such a move-Katie Degentesh, 
        for example. The truth is, Flarf is not a movement, never was, because 
        it has no principles as such, beyond some characteristic compositional 
        techniques that developed along the way (collaging Google search-engine 
        results, etc.).</p>
      <p>There is no such thing as Flarf. Useless to declare that now!<br>

        <br>
        A couple of years ago, if you'll remember, on the Women's Poetry list, 
        a number of people began posting in horror at finding their names, with 
        poems they hadn't written, on poetry.com. I remember going to the site 
        and realizing immediately it was one of those &quot;poetry contest&quot; 
        scams. A year or so before that I had spoken on the phone with my grandfather, 
        not many days before he died, and he had told me then how proud he was 
        that he had won some sort of poetry contest, and that he had ordered the 
        book, etc. I had always felt bad about that, and once I was on the poetry.com 
        site, I wrote what I thought would be the most offensive poem I could 
        manage, and submitted it to the &quot;contest&quot;:<br>
        <br>
        Mm-hmm<br>
        Yeah, mm-hmm, it's true<br>
        big birds make<br>

        Cuz I love thee. Thank you God, for listening!<br>
        <br>
        To my amazement, I received, about three weeks later, a letter from poetry.com, 
        with my poem fully visible through the cellophane window of the envelope. 
        The letter, in part, read:<br>
        <br>
        <i>&quot;Gary, over the past year, we have conducted an exhaustive examination 
        of over 1.2 million poems that have been submitted to us. Only a small 
        percentage of individuals whose poems we have reviewed were selected to 
        be part of this distinguished project. &quot;'Mm-hmm' was selected for 
        publication because it sparks the imagination and provides the reader 
        with a fresh, unique perspective on life. We believe it will add to the 
        importance and appeal of this special edition. _Of course, Gary, as always, 
        you are under no obligation whatsoever to submit any entry fee or subsidy 
        payment, or to make a purchase of any kind_. Your poem will be presented 
        in the most elegant way possible. This coffee-table quality book will 
        feature an 'Arristock leather' cover stamped in gold and a satin bookmarker 
        &#133;&quot;<br>
        </i><br>
        And it went on like that. I can't remember if I said anything about this 
        on the Women's Poetry list (I might have unsubscribed by then), but I 
        was on the subpoetics list at the time, and posted something about it, 
        and encouraged others to submit poems to poetry.com. There were a few 
        takers, including Kasey Mohammad and maybe Drew Gardner. Meanwhile, Nada, 
        Mitch Highfill and I began writing more of these awful poems, and submitting 
        them to the site under a variety of different names. <br>
        <br>
        Somewhere in all of this, the word &quot;flarf&quot; materialized-it may 
        have been Mitch's word, or Drew's, or Nada's, I'm not sure. But somehow, 
        &quot;flarf&quot; began to take on a meaning: &quot;having the quality 
        of flarfiness.&quot; We now began to look at other things and to see them 
        as &quot;flarfy.&quot; I was never 100% sure what it meant-something akin 
        to &quot;campy,&quot; but with somewhat different resonances. More awkward, 
        stumbling, &quot;wrong&quot; than camp. The flarf &quot;voice&quot; in 
        my head was that of my father, a transplanted southerner, who likes to 
        pontificate, and who has a lot of opinions that kind of horrify me.<br>
        <br>
        I liked being on the subpoetics list, but at times it felt a bit stifling-very 
        P.C. So I began using &quot;flarf&quot; on the list as a way of keeping 
        my own tendencies toward repression-which the list seemed to help foster--at 
        bay. During a reading in New York, I read one flarf I'd sent to the list, 
        &quot;New Year's Post,&quot; and surprisingly, it went over incredibly 
        well. My notions of what might be &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; 
        were being questioned by the response. (I wound up publishing it in <i>How 
        to Proceed in the Arts</i>.)<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, I think both Drew and Kasey were doing a fair amount of flarfing 
        of their own. Drew began to do odd word-combo searches on Google for things 
        like &quot;Rogaine bunny&quot; and wrote poems using the results. I don't 
        think, at least at first, that he thought much more of these poems than 
        that they were kind of hilarious monstrosities. Drew and Nada and I used 
        to send a lot of three-way e-mails back and forth, often with poetry-related 
        jokes, parodies, and-increasingly-flarf.<br>
        <br>
        In March or May of 2001, a number of us started the flarflist-I'm not 
        entirely sure who all was on it then: Me, Nada, Drew, Mitch, Jordan Davis, 
        Carol Mirakove, Kasey, Katie Degentesh. Soon after, Maria Damon, Erik 
        Belgum came on. <br>
        <br>
        The first post to the list was &quot;Angry at God,&quot; a play I'd written 
        doing a Google search on the words &quot;awww&quot; &quot;yeah&quot; and 
        &quot;God.&quot; (Published in the first issue of Pompom.) This was quickly 
        followed by posts from Kasey (&quot;Crucifixion Xing&quot;:<br>

        Katie began taking interoffice memos she received on the job and flarfing 
        them:<br>
        TO: All New York Office Employees <br>
        FROM: Human Resources Loveroll <br>
        DATE: May 8, 2001 <br>
        RE: Hot Hatred and Hot Business Coital Attire </p>
      <p>In the spirit of the upcoming season, hot hatred and business coital 
        attire will begin on Monday, May 21 and end on Friday, August 31, 2001. 
      </p>
      <p>Hot Hatred </p>
      <p>As hot approaches we are pleased to remind all employees that we will 
        be milking a condensed milk week. During the hot months, there will be 
        extended office hatred Monday through Thursday, allowing for a * day on 
        Friday. Please see the guidelines below: </p>
      <p>Regular office hatred will be 9:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday 
        and 9:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on Friday. In order to accommodate this schedule, 
        lunch periods, which are unloved, should be limited to 45 pieces of popcorn. 
        Department heads may allow an individual to adjust his/her core milking 
        hatred while still milking the full weekly hatred. All employees <br>
        will milk their regularly scheduled hatred within a week (barring evacuation 
        or jail time) regardless of starting or ending time. </p>
      <p>The office will remain open on Friday afternoons for those of you who 
        wish to complete pregnancies or have regular milk to finish, however, 
        there will be no mailroom or reception services beyond 1:00 p.m. </p>
      <p>If you schedule Friday as an evacuation day, it will count as one full 
        day as per our evacuation policy. </p>
      <p>To receive unconditional love, an employee must be at milk (or on an 
        authorized jihad) on the milk day immediately proceeding and the milk 
        day immediately following the day on which the unconditional is observed. 
        If an employee is absent on one or both of these days because of sexual 
        activity or illicit affairs, the Company reserves the right to verify 
        the reason before approving unconditional love. [&#133;]</p>
      <p>People on the list would respond to each other's posts with other posts 
        picking up on words, word-combos, themes, forms, etc. But by September 
        2001 the list became relatively silent. Not too long after 9/11, people 
        began posting again, though now all of the flarfs-many of which were parodies 
        of AP News items-in some way shape or form addressed the aftermath of 
        9/11, including media portrayal of same. I remember, for instance, Katie's 
        &quot;We'll rebuild the Twin Towers-on your Pizza&quot; (which I think 
        was published in the latest online edition of Arras). I started a &quot;sadness&quot; 
        series-doing searches on &quot;The horrible sadness,&quot; &quot;the awful 
        sadness,&quot; &quot;the unending sadness,&quot; etc., in response to 
        what was becoming a kind of stifling national(ist) mourning.<br>
        <br>
        Some listmembers dropped out and in time others came on board: David Larsen, 
        Rodney Koeneke, Michael Magee, Rod Smith, Daniel Bouchard, Sharon Mesmer. 
        Some are silent observers, others participate regularly. Some consider 
        the list a kind of joke list among friends, others use it to develop longer 
        work (e.g., Kasey, <i>Deer Head Nation</i>, Michael Magee, <i>My Angie 
        Dickinson</i>, and Jordan's series of fairly matter-of-fact &quot;expose&quot; 
        poems about Senators and Representatives).<br>
        <br>
        While I haven't been very active on the list for the last couple of months, 
        I was using it for about a year or more to generate plays and poems, not 
        all of which necessarily had the quality of &quot;flarfiness&quot; (the 
        Bollywood poems, for instance), though each came up initially as an attempt 
        to do something I &quot;wasn't supposed to&quot; do.<br>
        <br>
        ******</p>
      <p>Okay, now for my own thoughts:</p>
      <p>MIKE MAGEE:</p>
      <p>The &quot;separate mailing list&quot; Kasey mentioned came to be known 
        by its members as the &quot;flarflist&quot; - a sort of ad hoc listserv 
        whith remains active with about a dozen members including myself. It's 
        heavily weighted toward new poems rather than discussion. Most members 
        took out hotmail accounts and invented pseudonyms for the occasion. One 
        joins the list by being &quot;invited&quot; by someone already on the 
        list (really, simply given all the email addresses) and sending a poem 
        along. My own understanding of it went something like this: &quot;Flarf&quot; 
        is a collage-based method which employs Google searches, specifically 
        the partial quotes which Google &quot;captures&quot; from websites. In 
        its early manifestations it was VERY whimsical and went something like 
        this: you search Google for 2 disparate terms, like &quot;anarchy + tuna 
        melt&quot; - using only the quotes captured by Google (never the actual 
        websites themselves) you stitch words, phrases, clauses, sentences together 
        to create poems. To me, it's interesting for a number of reasons -- its 
        collaborative texture, its anthropological implications (the sampling 
        of an enormous variety of public speech based on a single word or phrase 
        shared in common), its comic (not to say unserious) frame. Gradually people 
        got more ambitious both in their use of the technology (somewhat) and 
        in the poems themselves.</p>
      <p>My own contribution was to invent the &quot;Mainstream Poetry Movement.&quot; 
        It is, first and foremost, a perhaps ludicrous attempt to appropriate 
        the term &quot;Mainstream Poetry,&quot; which as you of course know has 
        come to mean any poems running the gamut from new-formalist-but-not-too-strident-from-respectable-press 
        to MFA or post MFA-generated autobiographical lyrics in a free (though 
        basically iambic) verse structure. I had the epiphany that nothing could 
        be stupider than labeling this &quot;mainstream.&quot; In the mainstream 
        of what?? </p>
      <p>As you can tell by going to the<a href="http://mainstreampoetry.blogspot.com/"> 
        www.mainstreampoetry.com</a> website, the poems can seem positively juvenile 
        and silly. But this to me is not at all to its detriment - sometimes it's 
        a scorchingly ironic silliness, sometimes a frantic post-9/11 silliness 
        or a wonderful gender-bending silliness, like Carla Harryman meets Bugs 
        Bunny. And given the relative stability of the method the variety produced 
        and dare I say uniqueness which each poet brings to these compositions 
        is to me quite remarkable. In a statement for the recent Poetry Project 
        Newsletter, I had this to say about my own motivations for turning to 
        the comic and even the stupid in this work:</p>
      <p>*************<br>
        <br>
        I would like, would very much like, to say exactly what Williams said 
        in his introduction to <i>The Wedge:</i></p>
      <p>The war is the first and only thing in the world today.<br>
        The arts generally are not, nor is this writing a diversion from that 
        for relief, a turning away. It <i>is</i> the war or part of it, merely 
        a different sector of the field.</p>
      <p><br>
        Williams's introduction is an argument, a great one, for poetry's usefulness 
        and relevance. But the context in which he wrote it differs greatly from 
        our own. First of all, Williams believed the United States was fighting 
        a relatively just war; and, however reluctantly the U.S. may have bumbled 
        into it, and whatever the contradictions and failings of their engagement, 
        I would tend to agree. Also, Williams had a greater faith than I can muster 
        in the poem's ability, not only to <i>be</i> peculiar (in a form intrinsic 
        to content) but to <i>maintain</i> those qualities for more than a New 
        York minute.</p>
      <p>The state has always attempted to co-opt the language of dissent and 
        so de-fang it, and the democratic-capitalist state (yes, I know) does 
        it better than any other because it can couch the very act of co-optation 
        as either &quot;dialogue&quot; or as the marketing of a revolutionary 
        new product (cool). Or, worst of all, can simply adopt the symbols of 
        dissent and none of its politics: hence Nixon's flashing of the &quot;peace&quot; 
        sign. Peace or victory? No matter, the collapse is/was precisely the point.</p>
      <p>If &quot;younger people are unable to sustain utopian visions&quot; as 
        Hejinian suggests, it's because the language of utopian visions goes from 
        our minds to our voices to the street and the magazine and finally to 
        the advertisement (for Old Navy or for The Marines, no matter) in the 
        blink of an eye. I suppose Barrett Watten's argument is that the Berkley 
        Free Speech and Vietnam Anti-War movements identify this problematic and 
        address it, and that Language Writing likewise addresses it. True. But 
        Kerouac, Miles and Ginsberg in their khakis? Or more to the point &quot;the 
        revolution will not be televised&quot; -- until it is, in a Nike commerical, 
        where, incidentally, we are informed not that &quot;the revolution will 
        be live&quot; (Gil Scott-Heron's closing words) but that &quot;the revolution 
        is about basketball and basketball is the truth&quot; (KRS-One's words, 
        as dictated by Phil Knight). Ugh. I don't believe that we lack our defining 
        big bad political moment -- it's here brothers and sisters. But like a 
        crafty virus, the problem of language has mutated.</p>
      <p>I reject out of hand the notion that poets of my generation are practicing 
        mere experimental aestheticism. Of course there's some of that, there 
        always has been; the mere imitating of a style for whatever gain. But 
        to say that Rodrigo Toscano, Heather Fuller, Mytili Jagannathan aren't 
        writing vital poetry both political and experimental to its very bones? 
        C'mon. And I could name two dozen others off the top of my head. If you 
        ain't seeing it you ain't looking in the right place.</p>
      <p>As I say, the problem seems to me to have changed and so the solutions 
        will be different. One can at least propose that Nixon and Kissinger were 
        able to perpetrate their crimes because they were devious. George W. Bush 
        is an utter dumbfucking fool achieving the same effect. Amazingly, everyone 
        seems to understand this, even many of the people who vote for him. I 
        feel compelled in the face of this to interrogate dumbness, ridiculousness, 
        stupidity; to work undercover in the middle of it, to pretend to be it 
        if necessary, all the while reporting back to the reader. I have in mind, 
        always now, Frederick Douglass's words, &quot;At a time like this, scorching 
        irony, not convincing argument is needed&quot; (1852). I've been composing 
        a series of poems called &quot;Fascist Fairytales.&quot; In one of them, 
        a poem-play, Margaret Thatcher has a dialogue with The Sphinx, who is 
        initially skeptical of her politics but eventually falls in love with 
        her. It closes with a nuclear catastrophe, a loving embrace, and Thacher's 
        proclamation, &quot;Bomb Turks, I'm in love!&quot; Isn't that precisely 
        what she meant? </p>
      <p><br>
        ***</p>
      <p>Kasey followed up my &quot;Mainstream&quot; idea with this statement:</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p><br>
        KASEY:<br>
        <i>Towards a Mainstream Poetics</i></p>
      <p>Want to take seriously [Pixar-esque weasel/clown-faces behind me fleer 
        and moue] for a bit here Mike Magee's reconfiguration of the poetic Mainstream.</p>
      <p>Others have pointed this out before, of course, but &quot;mainstream 
        poetry&quot; as usually construed by its opponents is anything but. What 
        on earth, as Mike asks, is mainstream about Robert Pinsky? A mainstream 
        is a forceful, central current that carries in its path all the debris 
        and livestock and entire vacationing families that get vortexed into it. 
        It is not a carefully constructed iron walkway that escorts the effete 
        peripatetic poet safely above a scenic view of the countryside and its 
        filthy horizon. In the mainstream, you have to shout to be heard above 
        the roar of the already-tired water metaphor I'm spinning out here. In 
        the mainstream, the weasels with clown faces have uzis. The mainstream 
        is the scary global video game we live in, everyday, and it has nothing 
        to do with some absurd publishing scam within which a few bloodless surrealists 
        and failed classicists and Tools of the Homespun False Consciousness get 
        to define what is normative.</p>
      <p>If you want to break it down by sales figures and numbers of readers, 
        the margins between the Big Names and the small press world are negligible 
        in light of the overall money-losingness of poetry. Most of the poetry 
        read on a daily basis in this country, I'll wager, is amateur poetry circulated 
        between individuals and posted on the internet.</p>
      <p>So what would it mean for poetry to be truly mainstream? It would have 
        to be aggressively public, perhaps--distributed via mass mailing or spam 
        messages, say. It would have to be as shameless as television in its bid 
        to engage new readers, and even, potentially, make money. Imagine that: 
        poetry that made money. Do you feel a bristling in your blood at the hint 
        of sacrilege? What shall I do with all the money my new, Mainstream poetry 
        is going to make...? After I pay off my student loans and credit card 
        debts, maybe I'll finance a series of poetry billboards that respond electronically 
        to the radio signals from passing cars and compose digital aleatory compositions 
        designed to influence the way people shop for fabric. Maybe I'll fund 
        a political party whose platform involves the legalization of plagiarism. 
        Maybe I'll pay some high school kids to translate the Iliad homophonically 
        and have homeless people read the results on cable access TV. Although 
        it would make more sense to pay the homeless people, wouldn't it? You 
        see how anarchically irrational and unfair poetry in the real world would 
        be!</p>
      <p>Let's start a lo-fi, low residency MFA program dedicated to the advancement 
        of guerilla Mainstream poetics. As Juliana Spahr recently mentioned, there 
        are certainly enough unemployed poets with Ph.D.'s out there to band together 
        and get such a thing accredited. I don't know how that stuff works, but 
        basically don't you just take out an ad in <i>Poets &amp; Writers</i> 
        or whatever and then people pay you money to entertain them in the countryside 
        for a weekend or two? Give the thing some hip jazzy name like the Institute 
        of Post-Avant Poetics, and you're all set. And stop at nothing--T-shirts, 
        coffee cups, bumper stickers, mouse pads.... Invite big-name poet-celebrities 
        to our conventions: Suzanne Somers, Leonard Nimoy, and Jewel alongside 
        Lytle Shaw, Anselm Berrigan, and Lisa Jarnot. Special musical guests. 
        Softball games. Cotton candy. And in the background, the weasels with 
        clown faces, always softly stalking and slavering.<br>
        <br>
        *****</p>
      <p>Lastly, I'll include a short thing I wrote a sent to the Flarflist in 
        Oct 2002 - to mixed reviews. Some of the folks on the Flarflist were/are 
        not crazy about the literary critic in me, at least as it pertains to 
        flarf. Anyway, this compares flarf to O'Hara's &quot;Personism&quot;:</p>
      <p>MIKE MAGEE:<br>
        <br>
        ******<br>
        The use of Google being extremely common, the flarf method resembles in 
        some sense: a) the use of a thesaurus; b) eavesdropping and quoting; c) 
        sampling; d) collage / cut-&amp;-paste (for which I can think of many 
        many precedents from Eliot to Langston Hughes to Berrigan and just about 
        every experimental writer from that point on). What makes the flarf methodology 
        different, to my mind, is the willful democratization of the method: the 
        EXTENSIVE and even sole use of Googled material and the hyper-collaborative 
        quality of the CONSTANT exchange -- the SPEED (or seeming speed) of composition. 
      </p>
      <p>This will sound needlessly hyperbolic but it seems to me that there's 
        an analogy to be made between flarf and O'Hara's Personism -- which itself 
        was a technology-based/generated poetry: to borrow a formula, the web 
        is to flarf what the telephone was to O'Hara: 1) a way to gather and exchange 
        information very very quickly AS A FORM OF POETRY; 2) a way to undercut 
        and/or render flexible the idea of authorship; 3) a way to, as Duncan 
        said of O'Hara, &quot;restore to poetry its trivial uses.&quot;</p>
      <p>One might say that Flarf is a radical elevation of the tendencies already 
        there in Personism. </p>
      <p>If the occassion called for it I could make this claim in very very very 
        intimidating THEORYSPPCCHHHChhgggccchh ARF ARF ARF. </p>
      <p>But anyway it's true. </p>
      <p>To steal another formulation from O'Hara, flarf being surer and quicker 
        than poetry, it is only just that flarf finish poetry off. <br>
        <br>
        *******</p>
      <p>I myself am not exclusively writing flarf-poems, but the tone(s) of everyone's 
        flarf poems is already finding its way into the poems written without 
        any use of Google whatsoever. </p>
      <p>One of the things which was a revelation to me was the quasi-oldSkool 
        sounds of what I equate to either manic b-boy Instant Message ranting, 
        or manic teenage (grrrl) IM chat (eg &quot;I am soooooooo interested&quot;) 
        -- that this was a kind of speech which was everywhere and which had an 
        architecture of its own but was sort of unrecognized too. Flarf brings 
        that to the fore in a way that seems much closer to the lived experience 
        of having to scurry one's self-expression through/into THE MEDIA than 
        any other web-based poetry I've come across. All of this is offered with 
        the simple proviso that a number of the founding &quot;Flarfists&quot; 
        consider flarf itself to be dead.</p>
