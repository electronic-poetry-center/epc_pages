        <hr>
        <P> Charles Bernstein, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, 
          is known as a theorist and writer of "language" poetry. Among his 12 
          collections, the two most recent are "With Strings" (University of Chicago 
          Press, 2001) and "Republics of Reality: 1975-1995" (Sun &amp; Moon Press, 
          2000). But he's also an active essayist, editor and translator, and 
          has collaborated with composers. </P>
        <P>Our excerpt — four sections from "Doctrine of Similarity (13 Cannons)" 
          is the third scene of the libretto for "Shadowtime" (1998-2000), a collaboration 
          with composer Brian Ferneyhough on the life and work of the German Jewish 
          cultural critic Walter Benjamin. The opera was commissioned by the Munich 
          Bienalle for May 2004, and will have a U.S. premiere in July as part 
          of the Lincoln Center Festival. [<a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/linking-page/Bernstein-2000.html">More 
          information and audio at PENNsound.</a>]</P>
        <P>"Doctrine of Similarity" refers "to a key essay by Benjamin in which 
          he explores the mimetic/echoic relation of language, world and cosmos," 
          Bernstein told the Forward. There's lots of mimicking and playful echoing 
          in the poems as well. Bernstein works with words as meanings and words 
          as words — as objects to be manipulated, shuffled, distorted and juxtaposed, 
          often exposing new meanings not apparent at first glance. </P>
        <P>In "Sometimes," the burning book and "staying alive at a particular 
          time" clearly refer to dramatic events in Benjamin's lifetime, cut short 
          at age 48 — he was an influential literary theorist who escaped from 
          Germany, only to die crossing into Spain in 1940. In the second half 
          of the poem, Bernstein rearranges the opening phrases, redirecting the 
          text toward our present predicament. "Sometimes/ you burn a book because" 
          — the phrase is not completed because "because" cannot make sense, or 
          perhaps because for those who burn books, "because" is its own reason. 
          Bernstein produces a new text with multiple possible readings that resonate 
          with and extend the initial expression.</P>
        <P>A similar approach can be seen in "Schein," a German word with many 
          meanings — sheen, shine, glow, illusoriness, sham — that Bernstein puns 
          over into English, researching the "space between shine and shame."</P>
        <P>Finally, in "Anagrammatica," Bernstein obsessively rearranges the name 
          Walter Benjamin into a series of identities, some apt epithets — "Brain 
          mantle Jew/ Brain mental Jew" — others at best cryptic, like "A mint 
          bran jewel." The work reaches cadence with "Atman Berlin Jew," attaching 
          the universal soul of Hinduism to a very particular identity that proved 
          to be Benjamin's fate. In one deft anagram, Bernstein tersely eulogizes 
          a major thinker who lived in complete freedom of mind, but died as a 
          Jew. </P>
