      <p>My wing is poised to beat<br>

        -- Gershom Scholem, &#147;Greetings from Angelus&quot; [tr. Richard Sieburth]<br>
        <br>
        There is a painting by Klee called <i>Angelus Novus</i>. It shows an angel 
        who seems about to move away from something he stares at. His eyes are 
        wide, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how the angel of 
        history must look. His face is turned toward the past. Where a chain of 
        events appears before <i>us, he</i> sees on single catastrophe, which 
        keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it at his feet. The angel 
        would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. 
        But a storm is blowing from Paradise and has got caught in his wings; 
        it is so strong that the angel can no longer close them. This storm drives 
        him irresistibly into the future to which his back is turned, while the 
        pile of debris before him grows toward the sky. What we call progress 
        is <i>this</i> storm.</p>
