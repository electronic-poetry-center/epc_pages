            <P><CITE>Les froissements des Ailes de Gabriel</CITE> (The beatings 
              of Gabriel's wings) brings together two persisting threads in Ferneyhough's 
              music of the past couple of decades. On the one hand, it continues 
              a series of works for soloist and chamber ensemble, each of which 
              finds a new way of evoking yet questioning the traditional &quot;concerto&quot; 
              concept. On the other, it forms part (in fact, the second scene) 
              of the &quot;scenic work&quot;. <CITE>Shadowtime</CITE>, an &quot;opera 
              ofs&quot; centering on the philosopher Walter&nbsp;Benjamin that 
              has preoccupied the composer since 1999. Without wishing to push 
              paradox too far, one might say that we are dealing here with a &quot;concerto&quot; 
              that is not really a concerto, forming part of an &quot;opera&quot; 
              that is not really an opera. </P>
            <P>The figure invoked in the title is, evidently, the angel of the 
              Annunciation, the rustling of whose wings long ago opened Heinrich&nbsp;Biber's 
              cycle of &quot;Mystery Sonatas&quot;, and more significantly, led 
              the 12th century Persian mystic Sohravardi to surmise that the two 
              wings -- one orientated to celestial light, the other to earthly 
              shadow -- were the channel by which divinity could pass from heaven 
              to earth. But there's a broader angelology at work here. Since <CITE>Shadowtime</CITE> 
              revolves around Benjamin, the natural starting point is Paul&nbsp;Klee's 
              picture <CITE>Angelus Novus</CITE> -- in Benjamin's interpretation, 
              an image of the &quot;Angel of History&quot; who gazes back at the 
              debris of everything that still lies in front of us. This in turn 
              evokes the &quot;terrifying&quot; angels of Rainer&nbsp;Maria&nbsp;Rilke's 
              &quot;Duino Elegies&quot;: the ones who &quot;serenely disdain to 
              annihilate us&quot;. </P>
            <P><CITE>Les froissements des Ailes de Gabriel</CITE> is the one scene 
              of <CITE>Shadowtime</CITE> where -- perhaps self-evidently -- no 
              words are sung or spoken. So what is it doing in an &quot;opera&quot;? 
              It's no surprise to learn that it has a symbolic function. After 
              a more or less realistic first scene, at the hotel on the Spanish 
              border where Benjamin will commit suicide, this &quot;angel concert(o)&quot; 
              seeks to perform a sort of allegorical &quot;extinction of time&quot; 
              analogous to the &quot;deafness to time&quot; sometimes attributed 
              to angels (who are alleged to act within time, but to be oblivious 
              to it). </P>
            <P>The work is written for solo guitar and an ensemble of 13 
            players: 4 woodwinds, 3 brass, 2 strings, and various &quot;struck and 
            plucked&quot; instruments (harp, piano, percussion, and most notably a 
            second guitar, tuned down a quarter-tone, which one can partly 
            regard as the soloist's &quot;dark other&quot;). Ferneyhough describes the 
            piece as &quot;an investigation of suddenness as aesthetic and formal 
            category&quot;, and this in itself gives cause for thought. For most 
            composers (and indeed listeners), musical &quot;form&quot; acts as a kind of 
            security: as something reliable to cling on. With Ferneyhough, this 
            is rarely, if ever, the case: on the contrary, &quot;form&quot; is conceived 
            more as a precarious tightrope over an abyss. But even in 
            Ferneyhough's terms, <CITE>Les froissements</CITE> represents an 
            extreme. He once described it, with a touch of gallows humour, as 
            &quot;245 bars of total non-sequiturs&quot;; more specifically, there are 124 
            fragments, each rarely more than a few seconds in length, and each 
            meticulously sculpted, with its own distinctive instrumentation and 
            (often glittering) &quot;texture types&quot;. The point at issue here is that 
            the material intentionally passes by too fast for one to make 
            connections, even if they do in fact exist. This is turn gives an 
            ironic twist to the invocation of Gabriel: can his message -- his 
            &quot;annunciation&quot; - in fact be received within &quot;human&quot; time? In this 
            context, it may not be too fanciful to interpret the soloist's last, 
            whirling figure as a final, exasperated rustling of the angel's 
            wings. </P>
