      <p>Unlike my approaches to stylistic continuity in instrumental compositions, 
        I have always begun a new vocal work with a certain amount of trepidation. 
        This is, to be sure, partly to do with entering the complex world of another 
        artist as, as it were, an overweening late-comer; whilst this is of course 
        not to be understated, it does not lie at the centre of my concerns, which 
        is to be found, rather, in the array of implicit or explicit fault lines 
        exposed by two world systems, those of verbal / conceptual as opposed 
        to musical discourse. </p>
      <p>I have sometimes spoken of music as being, if not a language, them amenable 
        to being treated as if it were a language. This primarily operative assumption 
        aids my stylistic evolution to the extent that it enables me to ignore 
        wider philosophical concerns which, because articulating more abstract 
        issues, are likely to stand in the way of concrete, context oriented enactments 
        of meaning production. One might imagine, I suppose, that this would render 
        the alliance of poetic texts and musical con-texts less, rather than more, 
        problematic: in fact, however, it is not infrequently precisely this twofold 
        emphatic emplacement of aesthetic locality which gives rise to a fatal 
        flaw or discontinuity which the composer ignores at his peril. </p>
      <p>Thus we are left with alternate but equally enervating states of affair. 
        On the one hand, the demands of 'standard received' textual conventions 
        - sentence structure, accentuation, case agreements and the like - relentlessly 
        conspire to undermine optimal deployment of musically immanent parsing 
        devices; on the other, the very departure from these norms which characterizes 
        much highly-individuated poetic locution presents the composer with the 
        prospect of text-music discontinuities of daunting proportions. Since 
        it is usually music (as the aptly named 'setting') which is imagined as 
        faithfully serving the text by displaying it to best advantage, the composer 
        not prepared to accept this ritual self-effacement is constrained to formulating 
        and realizing quite complex work-specific strategies. In effect, he must 
        accept, re-inscribe and thus empower this fundamental fracture of communicative 
        discursivity as the price of creative liberty. </p>
      <p>Let me offer here only two examples from 20th Century vocal practice. 
        Firstly, I would argue that the striking discontinuity experienced when 
        reading the George texts taken by Sch&ouml;nberg for 'Das Buch der H&auml;ngenden 
        G&auml;rten' serves a double purpose. Who does not experience the energized 
        void, the ephemeral flickerings of transience evoked by the musical rhetoric 
        (if such be the appropriate term for the undissimulated energeticism of 
        expressive identity) in these songs? It is to be sure the transience of 
        the historically-bounded, the moment of ultimate dematerialized release; 
        at the same time we cannot by any manner of means discount the fact that 
        this release is achieved on the basis of poetic incorporation of sultry, 
        world-weary imagery and extreme self-aware artificiality of structure. 
        Who could argue that this staging of symbolic re-absorbtion of the Romantic 
        subject into the luxuriously oceanic presence of voluptuously tempting 
        materiality does not provide the composer with the opportunity to posit 
        another, fleeting and yet potent sense of Innerlichkeit, an inwardness 
        of the moment? In the same way, perhaps as the ubiquitous self-mirroring 
        of the row forms in late Webern frees us from the slavish reconstruction 
        of redundantly through-rationalized enactments of epistemological legitimization, 
        proposing to us a refreshingly uncloying perspective of compositional 
        liberty in other dimensions of decision making, so the suddenness of Sch&ouml;nbergian 
        expressivity in this seminal work is predicated on the presence of George's 
        ultimate foregrounding of mediation. </p>
      <p>My second example, also from Sch&ouml;nberg, is 'Pierrot Lunaire'. here, 
        musical and textual imagery go hand in hand. it is sometimes impossible 
        to say with certainty at which points the transcriptive effusion of vocal 
        usage flows over into the circumambient instrumental environment. Here, 
        one encounters the composer himself applying himself with exuberant excess 
        to the creation of musical forms which both distance themselves from, 
        and ultimately consume (and, in restrospect, ironically validate), the 
        crude dandyish formality of the texts themselves. </p>
      <p>Common to both these examples is the awareness of the impossible fracture 
        I spoke of at the outset. The composer who ignores or seeks to cosmeticize 
        this discontinuity can scarcely avoid locating himself on one side or 
        the other of this basic divide. If, however, we succeed in finding new 
        ways, no matter how provisional or work-specific, of mapping and resonating 
        the divide this is still a challenge worth the candle.</p>
      <p>It is difficult for me to completely separate my identity as a composer 
        from that of pedagogue. I find myself frequently asking myself the same 
        questions that I might pose to a pupil as a way of surmounting a creative 
        obstacle. When text is involved one needs, above all, to acquire a sense 
        of the degree to which the active sense of its context is to be rendered 
        account of in the conjoined form. A certain degree of autonomy may be 
        defined along this path. On occasion, though, I am strongly persuaded 
        of the expediency of undertaking the assimilative process in several discontinuous 
        steps. If, for instance, the text to be set is viewed initially as 'available 
        material' there are many qualities contributory to its aesthetic presence 
        which can serve the composer's purpose in, as it were, the prelapsarian 
        space of fractureless innocence. Information gleaned from such considerations 
        can be deployed by the composer either as conceptual regulators or as 
        value-free quanta to be regarded as equals in precompositional dispositions. 
        The empowering aspects of the fracture come increasingly to the fore the 
        more the communal materiality of text and music are invoked. </p>
      <p>Each of my own vocal works has necessarily given rise to lengthy reflections 
        on such matters, and each work has succeeded - or failed - on the innate 
        degree of plausibility with which sufficient aspects of the textual dimension 
        are first of all bracketed out, then folded back in at a later stage of 
        the compositional process. Text setting is always a process, in that the 
        expression of time passing in the sedimentation and mutual infiltration 
        of incommensurables contributes to the sense of distance or proximity 
        with which text and music speak to (or past) one another. Vital concerns 
        of a developing musical language (however defined) must withstand the 
        test of fire and prove themselves equal, in any given work, to the formal 
        or pragmatic concerns of the text. They may be similar, they may be (as 
        in the first Sch&ouml;nberg example) crassly distinct; important, above 
        all, is the composer's awareness of the mutual incomprehension. </p>
      <p>At this point I should finally make the not insignificant distinction 
        between solo vocal and choral music. The latter is, in my experience, 
        somewhat easier to deal with than the former, in that a single voice invariably 
        engenders the impression of a single individual who speaks. Oftentimes 
        this impression proves more powerful than whatever other aspects of the 
        text the composer is attempting to address. In choral music, in contrast, 
        the obvious degree to which the text is 'orchestrated' is a constant corrective 
        to overly simplified and assimilative modes of reading. </p>
      <p>Most recently, work on my 'Shadowtime' has caused me to reflect upon 
        the conventions of characterization, the use of received historical forms 
        as mediational instances and the nature and demands of libretti. Remembering 
        my previous experience in vocal music, I asked Charles Bernstein, my librettist, 
        himself fully awake to this complex of issues, to produce a text that 
        at one and the same time would accept manipulation (permutation, repetition, 
        mass exchange of segments) and be, in its own right, an independent poetic 
        text. This he achieved, so that I was able to modulate with great fluidity 
        between very diverse levels of structure and music - text interaction. 
        The first scene (the evening of Walter Benjamin's suicide on the Spanish 
        border in 1940) and the fifth both accept the conventions of dramatic 
        identity of individual figures. In order to ameliorate this for me unfamiliar 
        intimacy of person and 'voice' I adopted two distinct strategies. In Scene 
        1, although the action evolves in real time, several independent layers 
        of action, each with its own ensemble of voices and imagery, are superimposed, 
        thus forcing the ear to distance itself from the totality of what is heard 
        in order to focus on specific instantiations of character projection. 
        Scene 5, representing Benjamin (more precisely his post mortem avatar) 
        interrogated by a series of figures taken from history or mythology also 
        seeks to present each character through a specific set of musical devices. 
        Objectivizing instance here is the fact that each encounter also adopts 
        the conventions of a particular historical musical genre (rondo, passacaglia, 
        isorhythmic motet, quodlibet etc.), whereby the succession of interrogations 
        on the stage is paralleled by an overview of the development of occidental 
        musical forms from the 11th to the 19th Century. Perhaps the larger temporal 
        scale involved in music theatrical projects demands a more excessive or, 
        at any rate, explicit, form of fracture.</p>
      <p>All other vocal music throughout 'Shadowtime' is choral in nature, although 
        'The Doctrine of Similarity' seeks to maintain a fragile sense of permanent 
        recalibration of sense and mutual dissent by being divided into thirteen 
        separate movements, each of which is both clearly set off from the rest 
        by considerations of choral / instrumental disposition and re-integrated 
        in retrospect by a slowly emerging large-scale set of formal correspondences. 
        Like the writings of Benjamin himself, 'Doctrine' concerns itself in the 
        first instance not with presentation but 're-presentation', and it is 
        this dimension which permitted me to continually re-initialize the power 
        of auratic distance from movement to movement. The final scene is likewise 
        for choral forces only. The 'other' in this instance is the addition of 
        computer generated sounds. On a more intimate level, two distinct texts 
        are presented simultaneously, vying for prominence and, in addition, there 
        are many abrupt interventions of settings of an artificial 'negative vector' 
        language of my own devising. On each level, therefore, I sought to recall 
        to the mind's eye the vital fracture of word and world, of world within 
        world which - nolens volens - lies at the heart of all vocal composition.</p>
