      <p>Brian Ferneyhough (1943 - ) is one of the best-known composers of new 
        music and he has friends in high places. When he composes his first opera, 
        it is sure to attract attention. No sooner has the piece been completed 
        than offers pour in from all over the world to perform it: Paris, London, 
        New York. For his libretto, he gets an Ivy League professor of English, 
        the award-winning poet Charles Bernstein. And he has a famous champion 
        for his work: the incredible Peter Ruzicka, director of the Salzburg Music 
        Festival, conductor, and also artistic director of the Biennale, the German-based 
        International Festival of New Music. Ruzicka commissioned the work for 
        this year's Biennale because &quot;Ferneyhough is an incredible composer 
        and the impact of his work is immense.&quot; ...<br>
        <br>
        Coventry-born Ferneyhough has the right pedigree for someone to make it 
        big even in today's difficult times. He studied at the Royal Academy of 
        Music and then had some scholarships to go study in Amsterdam and Basel. 
        He then taught in Germany until he was called to San Diego as professor. 
        Since 2000, he teaches at the prestigious Stanford University. And now 
        his first opera, Shadowtime, had its world premiere on May 25th, 2004. 
        Munich's Prinzregententheater, of which Ruzencka is the former director, 
        was lucky enough to host the event. People travelled from all over the 
        world to see this: many flew especially from the United States, others 
        came from England, from France, from all over Germany, from Italy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Shadowtime is about the life, death and works of Walter Benjamin, the 
        Jewish philosopher and poet, who killed himself in September 1940 on the 
        Spanish-French border while trying to flee from the Nazis. &quot;The older 
        we get, the fewer possibilities are open to us,&quot; Ferneyhough said 
        before the world premiere in Munich. &quot;Until, eventually, there is 
        only one option or, when we die, none left.&quot; Ferneyhough's many years 
        spent Germany explains why he speaks the language so well and, in part, 
        also his love for German literature and philosophy.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Shadowtime is an extremely visually engaging opera, which is carried 
        in part by a truly extraordinary libretto, written by the poet Charles 
        Bernstein who is Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania. 
        &quot; I believe that it is important that a libretto is real poetry, 
        as it was in the days of Verdi, and not just a vehicle to carry someone's 
        music and story. Libretto writing as an art form has all but disappeared 
        these days and so I try to counteract this trend,&quot; Bernstein said 
        after the premiere.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Here are some excerpts from Bernstein's libretto of Shadowtime, too good 
        to be missed:</p>
      <p><br>
        Emotion is the trace of a moment in time. It never signifies an end.<br>
        <br>
        I hold tight but find in my arms only the past.<br>
        <br>
        What transpires now has never before been and is already gone as you reflect 
        on it.<br>
        <br>
        I speak of the Messiah whom the poet senses without naming<br>
        the painter feels without seeing<br>
        the composer hears without noting<br>
        the philosopher supposes without knowing<br>
        <br>
        Mourning is a kind of listening<br>
        where the dead sing to us<br>
        and even the living tell their stories<br>
        <br>
        Death a veil<br>
        that opens onto a void<br>
        in which the heavenly<br>
        gathers itself<br>
        <br>
        Beauty is never the lifting of a veil<br>
        it is the secret of its enfolding<br>
        <br>
        When winds of change are gone<br>
        blasts of fear take hold<br>
        <br>
        Is the future a memory projected into time<br>
        or is the past a shadow of a future that never happens?<br>
        The past never passes but we pass over it<br>
        again and again, not listening to what it tells<br>
        but to the empty stories we tell about it.<br>
        <br>
        Are you waking from a dream or are you waking into a dream?<br>
        Are you remembering your dreams or dreaming that you have memories?<br>
      </p>
      <p>The opera was two hours without break, which some premiere guests considered 
        to be rather long, but the presence of a gang of angels, 16 of them, all 
        red-haired and singing a mixed chorus, solo and canons, was so engaging 
        that everyone paid attention until the end. It remains a mystery why angels 
        have red hair or why they watch and assist someone's suicide rather than 
        stepping in to prevent it, but then, modern opera is all about mystery 
        and about discovering what lies beneath the obvious.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;At first glance, my opera may seem disjointed,&quot; Ferneyhough 
        said, &quot;but this is because I want my audience to really pay attention 
        and find out that beneath the surface, there is unity and a very together 
        story that is being told in the music.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Shadowtime consists of seven scenes that act as self-contained units with 
        their own sound images, instrumentation and structure. The most engaging 
        of those is the fourth, which Ferneyhough calls &quot;the central showdown, 
        the frozen heart of the opera&quot;. Benjamin's journey into the underworld 
        is symbolized by a bar pianist. Playing his heart out long after the bar 
        has closed, he keeps discussing epistemological issues with his piano 
        and with the angel who stands by to turn the pages of his score.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you want straight-forward opera of the Verdi type, then Shadowtime 
        is not for you. But if you are a very visual person who likes a challenge 
        and a modern piece of work that forces you to think along with it every 
        step of the way, and if you love good poetry, then Shadowtime is a great 
        and unique artistic experience that you will never forget.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After Munich, Shadowtime will be performed in Paris, then London, and 
        then it goes across the pond for a New York performance.<br>
        <br>
        Bernstein's libretto, plain and simple, is the finest contemporary libretto 
        that I know of. For the sake of new music and the somewhat ailing standards 
        of libretto writing in general, one can only hope that Bernstein will 
        continue to take time out from his busy teaching and book writing schedule 
        to remain involved in music and write some more librettos in the years 
        to come. </p>
