        There are times when the music seems to go past too quickly, one idea 
        following the next at such speed that it's impossible to take any of them 
        in. This is deliberate. Angels, we are told, are deaf to time, since they 
        exist beyond it. Brian Ferneyhough wants us to know what it feels like 
        to be an angel. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Shadowtime is a big event in the new music world. It's the 61-year-old 
        composer's first opera, an unlikely and savagely complex debut. <br>
        Maturing in the intellectual exile of continental Europe, British-born 
        Ferneyhough soon became a dominant figure in Darmstadt, home of post-war 
        modernity. The term &quot;new complexity&quot; was coined for his style. 
        Now Ferneyhough teaches at Stanford University, but the Californian sun 
        hasn't mellowed him. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Four-and-a-half years in the making, Shadowtime is a seven-part reflection 
        on the philosophy of Walter Benjamin. Its premiere at the Munich Biennale 
        this week will be followed by performances in Paris, New York and the 
        Ruhr Valley. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course there is nothing as trashy as a narrative in the work, though 
        it does open with the last night of Benjamin's life, just before his 1940 
        suicide on the Spanish border. For the rest, there are canons, interrogations, 
        tableaux and lectures, all arranged in strenuous symmetry around Charles 
        Bernstein's opaque libretto. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Nobody can play Ferneyhough's music. The best they can hope for is an 
        approximation of the score. In this, the Neue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart 
        and the Nieuw Ensemble Amsterdam under Jurjen Hempel come formidably close 
        to achieving the impossible. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Director FredericFisbach does what he can to make a homogenous whole 
        from this disparate hodge-podge, but he can't disguise the fact that this 
        is not an opera but an assortment of musical numbers that lasts for two 
        hectic hours. Challenging? Yes. Entertaining? Occasionally. Comprehensible? 
        Perhaps to an elite handful. </p>
