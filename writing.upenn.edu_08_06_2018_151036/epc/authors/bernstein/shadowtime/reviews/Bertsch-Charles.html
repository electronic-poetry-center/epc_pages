<pre class="ct"><a name="AN0021414298-4">SHADOWTIME, an opera composed by Brian
Ferneyhough. Libretto by Charles Bernstein.
NMC Records. April 25, 2006
</a></pre>
<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">IS IT POSSIBLE TO
FORGET WITHOUT remembering that one has forgotten?" The words ring out
clearly, in stark contrast to the ones that precede and follow them,
forming an island of sense in a sea of sonic confusion. Even so, they
don't sound right. There's a trace of a lisp in the voice. The
pronunciation of "remembering" is askew, with a delay on the second
syllable, creating an aural hyphen. The strings in the background
underscore the vocalist's mannered delivery with a tension that holds
no promise of release. If Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland had been
properly set to music, this is what his hookah-smoking caterpillar
would have sounded like. And this is one of the more accessible moments
in composer Brian Ferneyhough and librettist Charles Bernstein's
challenging opera Shadowtime.</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">Indeed, it's hard to
imagine more uneasy listening. For those music lovers who keep their
home or car stereo tuned to a frequency that plays a steady stream of
Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, Shadowtime is bound to be off-putting.
Whereas the music of the masters creates a bubble of comfort that wards
off everyday pressures, Ferneyhough's composition stabs violently into
the personal space of its audience, savaging the illusion of serenity
promoted within the world of mainstream classical music. But because
Shadowtime reflects on the life and work of the leftist Jewish thinker
Walter Benjamin, noted for the density of his melancholy, and focuses
in particular on the tragic circumstances of his passing as he was
trying to flee France after the German invasion, the work's edginess is
understandable. The burden of hearing Shadowtime serves a purpose. This
is art that refuses to let you forget what you should always bear in
mind. That means the Shoah, first and foremost, but also loss more
generally.</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">Aside from its
atonality, the opera's most salient feature is Ferneyhough's decision
to obscure most of the words he asked Bernstein to write. Unless a
listener has the separately published libretto in hand while the CD is
playing, the majority of the text proves impossible to hear as text.
Words are reduced to the same status as other sounds, their meaning
under erasure. Asked, in an interview conducted for this piece, how it
felt to see his sublimely inventive poetry treated this way, Bernstein
expresses complete support for Ferneyhough's approach, underscoring the
importance of, "the different things that you can't hear, that are not
audible,' and those, "that become audible at the price of other things
not being audible. You can't hear everything all at once in crystal
clarity." The title of the opera, he adds, derives from the interplay
between what can and cannot be discerned. "The idea of the shadow or
the echo is crucial to the whole meaning of the opera. And it's played
out in this very issue of only partial legibility at any given time.
When you move to another mode, you gain something and you lose
something."</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">This formulation
provides a way to think more broadly about the aesthetic that
Shadowtime exemplifies and its implications for our understanding of
Benjamin's approach to culture. While drawing on recent innovations in
the use of rhythm and meter, as well as the vocal and narrative
conventions of Baroque opera, Ferneyhough's score is first and foremost
a tribute to the twelve-tone "new music" developed by Arnold Schönberg,
Alban Berg, and Anton Webern in the first two decades of the twentieth
century and then vigorously promoted by Benjamin's friend, philosopher
Theodor Adorno, well into the post-World War II era. The paradox of
this music's novelty is that, while it was already dismissed for being
dated when Adorno took up its cause as a music student in the 1920s, it
continues to sound more cutting edge than much newer work. To the
extent that the musical avant-garde is still associated with a kind of
sonic punishment, in which the listener is forced to confront the
ideological implications of pleasure, the "new music" of 1910 remains
the standard-bearer for progress.</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">It is worth noting
that even Schönberg ended up softening his opposition to tradition and,
as a consequence, his more popular rival Igor Stravinsky. Over time,
the innovations of the "new music" were incorporated into pieces that
also made use of traditional octaval melody and harmony. In the work of
Kurt Weill and Hans Eisler, the two composers who worked closely with
playwright Bertolt Brecht, traces of Schönberg's most radical work give
an edge to a sensibility that derives as much from the cabaret as the
concert hall. Despite the overwhelming evidence of serious music's need
to breed with popular culture, however, Adorno never relented in his
insistence that such hybridization represented the worst reactionary
tendencies. When he set out to write his own short "song-play" in the
early 1930s, a piece based on Mark Twain's fiction called The Treasure
of Indian-Joe, he composed vocal parts that refused the conventions of
nineteenth-century bourgeois opera and their modern continuation in the
work of Sergei Prokoviev, Richard Strauss, and Stravinsky. The two
extant songs from this unfinished project sound like a lot like
Schönberg, not to mention the Ferneyhough of Shadowtime.</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">This is where things
get a bit tricky. Eager for the approbation of his intellectual elder,
Adorno sent the libretto for The Treasure of Indian-Joe to Benjamin,
who managed not to comment on it, despite several requests, until he
finally provided his assessment in a letter. Lamenting the text's
"reduction to the idyllic," Benjamin compared it unfavorably to Jean
Cocteau's novel Enfants Terribles. He also indicated his lack of
interest in Adorno's struggle to defend the "new music." Benjamin
writes that, "the range of material itself--quite apart from the
musical question about which I cannot venture any opinion
whatsoever--appears to me to be an unpromising one." For someone who
wrote so widely on modern culture, it's truly startling how little
Benjamin had to say about music. Despite the fact that Adorno
repeatedly refers to music in their extensive correspondence, all that
Benjamin could muster in response was this rather condescending
profession of ignorance.</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">There's something a
little odd, then, about an opera on Benjamin's life and work that
largely conforms to Adorno's rigid musical standards. It begs the
question of whether a more populist approach might have been
preferable. After all, during the same period in which Adorno is
writing Benjamin about The Treasure of Indian-Joe, Benjamin is praising
Brecht in reply, almost as though he wanted to raise his friend's ire.
Bernstein remarks that, "in terms of Benjamin's interest in popular
culture, there doesn't seem to be a sampling or an engagement with
certain aspects of what people would consider to be popular music
within the Ferneyhough score. That's something many people mention to
me, even if they don't say it in those terms" What Shadowtime loses, in
other words, in prioritizing the "new music" over newer, less pure
musics, is this engagement with the popular.</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">But it also gains
something in the process. Bernstein goes on to contrast Ferneyhough to
"a John Adams or a Philip Glass or any number of other contemporary
composers that are doing opera, who make many more concessions to a
certain aspect of popular music." Bernstein continues:</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">I like popular music
quite a lot. And I'm not a composer. Probably if I were a composer I'd
be more like Kurt Weill than I would be like Brian Ferneyhough. A lot
of people don't like severe, atonal music. But that's what he does. You
never hear it on the radio either. Not just Brian's music, but the
whole twentieth-century tradition of it rarely comes on the radio, even
on the satellite radio shows. It's almost like spinach or something. I
love that music. I find it very engaging. There's a lot of stuff that
people enjoy and I enjoy too, that gets a lot of mileage in the New
York classical and new music scene. And ! understand that this is what
Ferneyhough doesn't do, which is what a John Zorn, say, does. But, in
the end, it seems to me that Ferneyhough's project is a very powerful
one and complexly interesting, whereas some of the stuff that we all
enjoy seems slighter to me.</a></p>

<p class="medium-normal"><a name="AN0021414298-4">Even if Shadowtime
seems to place Benjamin too squarely on the side of an anti-populist
Modernism, people interested in his work might benefit more from the
bitter greens of Ferneyhough's uncompromising music than from the
artificially sweetened fare we have come to expect in this era of
guilt-free collage. That bitter taste in your mouth might just remind
you of what you would have otherwise forgotten.</a></p>
