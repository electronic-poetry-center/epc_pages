      <DIV align=justify>The name of Brian Ferneyhough, who in the 1970s was 
      England’s most prominent export to the heartland of modernist Europe and 
      in the eighties consolidated a reputation as spiritual leader of the ’new 
      complexity’, seems even today to be a byword for all that is best and 
      worst about hard-line musical modernism.
      <HR>
       In the year after his sixtieth birthday, Ferneyhough must be the most 
      senior British composer of international standing still to be dismissed 
      outright or not taken seriously by a sizeable proportion of the 
      contemporary-music establishment at home. At the same time, he continues 
      to be feted both in America – where he has held a series of prestigious 
      teaching appointments – and in continental Europe, where he is a regular 
      guest lecturer at festivals and summer schools.
      <HR>
       It is some time since Ferneyhough received major exposure in London: last 
      year’s birthday celebrations centred, as far as the country of his birth 
      was concerned, on events in Durham and Huddersfield. He is probably best 
      known for his cycle of works inspired by Piranesi etchings, Carceri 
      d’Invenzione. (Indeed, Piranesi furnished the theme for the Purcell School 
      young composers’ workshop that took place earlier on this afternoon.)
      <HR>
       Among other vastly original aspects, Carceri – which comprises seven 
      works for varying forces, ranging from a piccolo solo to a fully-fledged 
      song-cycle and taking in three ensemble works along the way – seems to 
      have cultivated a taste for multi-work ’projects’ among composers of a 
      certain modernist bent. James Dillon, seven years Ferneyhough’s junior, 
      has often tended to work in this manner, creating ambitious cycles of 
      works for diverse forces, and <I>the soadie waste</I>, the piano quintet 
      for which seasoned Dillon interpreter Noriko Kawai joined the Arditti 
      Quartet in its afternoon concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall (though at 
      times the generic model seemed distant, and Kawai sounded more like an 
      accompanist in the intense rhythmic jolting and writhing of the ensemble), 
      is to feature in a new project – Anthropology, for narrator, dancers, 
      mixed ensembles and electronics. Quizzed on this way of working before the 
      Quintet’s UK premiere at last year’s Huddersfield Festival, Dillon 
      suggested that it might be an attempt by composers to gain more control 
      over the context in which their works are presented, an enticement away 
      from traditional mixed concert programmes. But it is striking how often we 
      are presented with not a concert-length staging of such a design, but a 
      collection of individual works by Dillon, Ferneyhough, Barrett and 
      company, works from larger cycles we rarely hear as such.
      <HR>
       Of course, single-work presentation is written into the bargain, both 
      artistically and commercially: the pieces are detachable after all, and a 
      composer would rather hear his music than wait for an ideal staging. And 
      if you are into big projects, as Stockhausen discovered with LICHT, you 
      can keep up appearances in the twenty-odd or however many years it takes 
      by incorporating precisely such detachable modules. Today’s batch of new 
      pieces comprised regional premieres of several works belonging to larger 
      projects as-yet-incomplete – whether just starting, as with Dillon’s, or 
      nearing their end, as is Ferneyhough’s Shadowtime project, due for its 
      integral premiere at the Munich Biennale this coming May when Seven 
      Tableaux Vivants Representing the Angel of History as Melancholia, heard 
      as a free-standing work in this Sinfonietta programme, will form its 
      penultimate section.
      <HR>
       Shadowtime is an opera on the death and (literal and ideational) 
      afterlife of Walter Benjamin, the German-Jewish literary critic and 
      philosopher-essayist who killed himself on the Spanish border in 1940 
      while trying to flee Vichy France. It’s true that not many operas contain 
      a detachable section for reciter and ensemble, never mind a guitar 
      concerto or a piece for speaking pianist. But Ferneyhough’s conception is 
      intensely theatrical. The latter work, Opus Contra Naturam, which has 
      already been heard in recital several times over the last four years, 
      stages Benjamin’s descent into the underworld to a series of questions and 
      open-ended answers concerning representation, spoken and finally shouted 
      by the white-clad, Liberace-like pianist at his black piano.
      <HR>
       In the last ten years or so Ferneyhough has carved out an aesthetic niche 
      with an admixture of Anglo-Saxon linguistic whimsy – a strong feeling for 
      the sensuous quiddity of language – to more abstract European 
      philosophical speculation, a combination which is both exciting and 
      endearing and which also well encapsulates the virtues of his librettist 
      Charles Bernstein’s texts of the piece played here. These ranged from 
      lyric re-workings of Heine, incorporating Benjaminesque concerns with 
      ’correspondences’ between apparently diverse phenomena of art, society and 
      economics, to offbeat humour such as the memorable and supremely 
      incontrovertible formulation “Fresh fruit is better than oily pyjamas.”
      <HR>
       Ferneyhough is a very earthbound intellectual, his complexities grounded 
      in a “conceptual synaesthesia” (as he called it in one of the filmed 
      interview extracts which introduced his pieces) which ties every idea to a 
      concrete image in a fashion rather like the Baroque ’emblems’ which so 
      fascinated Benjamin. Among his gifts is the ability to create striking 
      textures for the openings of pieces or sections, like the sudden 
      glissando-crescendo ’zoom’ which inaugurates the densely gestural 
      discourse of the Third Quartet or the strident piccolo-and-trombone 
      mixture at the start of Carceri d’Invenzione I. Seven Tableaux Vivants 
      conjured some extraordinary, ferocious sounds from a trio of deep bass 
      clarinets, and its wind-dominated tuttis at times recalled the sound-world 
      of Carceri d’Invenzione III. But, in a musical language which perhaps 
      relies too much on very elaborated, complex gestures, the by-now 
      inevitable falling-away from such openings is becoming something of a 
      trying mannerism, as in Seven Tableaux Vivants yet another piece starts 
      with a bang and ends with a whimper. Nonetheless, Incipits, heard in the 
      middle of today’s three concerts, made a sometimes-striking piece out of 
      the idea of continual successive openings, and contained some austerely 
      beautiful textures.
      <HR>
       A word on the delivery of the text for the new piece. Roderick Williams 
      is a very good baritone with excellent theatrical sense. But his voice was 
      both too close to the predominant low-hued instrumental timbres of 
      Ferneyhough’s music and, perhaps, insufficiently at home with its 
      idiosyncratic combination of registers. Ferneyhough, who gave the world 
      premiere in Paris last month but was not present tonight, might have 
      proved a better – more lively, and more audible – reciter.
      <HR>
       Seven Tableaux Vivants, and the Carceri d’Invenzione piece played in the 
      final concert, were heard alongside Richard Barrett’s texturally lucid 
      <I>stirrings</I>, six minutes’ worth of his evening-length Dark Matter, 
      and Morgan Hayes’s Dark Room for clarinet and ensemble. The Hayes and 
      Barrett were new to London, brought from a Bath Festival concert last 
      summer. These are two composers not played by the Sinfonietta on its home 
      ground before, and it is good to see these regional premieres finding 
      their way to the capital. (The Sinfonietta will UK-premiere music by Georg 
      Friedrich Haas, one of the most interesting of the middle generation of 
      German composers and practically unknown this side of the Channel, 
      alongside a piece by Wolfgang Rihm on 17 March.)
      <HR>
       Also in the evening concert, and also conceived as part of a larger 
      cycle, came the premiere of a work specially selected for the event by the 
      SPNM. Tazul Tajuddin’s Kehalusan Ukiran was all decoration, filigree, but 
      well heard enough, and surely more interesting than another new piece by a 
      young composer heard earlier in the day. Brian Herrington’s Symphonia, the 
      Royal Philharmonic Society Prize commission, was worthy, well-made and 
      almost wholly unmemorable.
      <HR>
       Yet another initiative for young composers, the London Sinfonietta’s Blue 
      Touch Paper project, had been the subject of a lunchtime round-table, 
      meanwhile, and one of the resulting pieces, Dai Fujikura’s Fifth Station, 
      also took its place in the concerts. Fujikura had the Sinfonietta’s 
      players disposed around the hall for a series of exchanges with the 
      onstage cello and (mainly muted) trumpet, and made sonic drama out of 
      trill-laden harmonic stasis.
      <HR>
       Puzzlingly, none of these pieces seemed to bear any strong connection to 
      Ferneyhough. The underlying agenda seems to have been that they, and all 
      the workshops and discussions, were there because this was two events in 
      one: a Ferneyhough day, but also a reinvention, unacknowledged as such, of 
      the “State of the Nation” weekend in which the Sinfonietta, SPNM, PRS and 
      other bodies have participated in recent Februarys. It is curious that the 
      Sinfonietta should be so shy about admitting to this – presumably because 
      it is a day, down from a whole weekend; in any case, the programming 
      juxtapositions to which it led were at times uncomfortable.
      <HR>
       Of the young composers we did hear, Morgan Hayes might have been thought 
      to fit best with the ’new complexity’ trio of Ferneyhough, Dillon and 
      Barrett. In fact, although Hayes’s Dark Room bore a passing resemblance to 
      aspects of Ferneyhough’s La Chute d’Icare (not heard tonight), it has more 
      in common with the music of his teacher Michael Finnissy, its surface 
      complexity open to diatonically-based pitch structures and to a strong 
      concern with melody – whether in interlocking heterophonic textures or as 
      decorative modal lines evoking the piece’s Moroccan inspiration. Likewise, 
      Hayes’s rhythmic language is grounded in a dance-like conception of bodily 
      movement, however complexly elaborated. Beginning with the oboe attempting 
      to assert itself as soloist, Hayes’s mini-concerto ended with the clarinet 
      soloist retreating again to join the oboe at the back of the stage. This 
      interesting conceit belied a relatively schematic formal trajectory, 
      though the sectional progression from the sharply-etched heterophonic 
      opening through the more chordally accompanied dispersion of energies was 
      certainly well-managed enough.
      <HR>
       Set against such elegantly-achieved musical competence, Ferneyhough’s 
      risks may have seemed too great at times, his compositional solutions 
      failing to live up to his stimulating, endlessly questing diagnosis of the 
      problems as a highly engaging public speaker, self-confident and 
      articulate. If the music falls flat, nothing is gained. But music is 
      nothing anyway if it is not more than the notes. Technical accomplishment, 
      such as we heard on and off throughout this day of new music, is the 
      necessary vehicle for a communicative impetus, which must establish common 
      ground with other areas of human endeavour, artistic and intellectual. I 
      was excited by my first encounter with Ferneyhough’s Opus Contra Naturam; 
      less so, on this one hearing, by Seven Tableaux Vivants. I look forward to 
      Shadowtime as a complete, musical and dramatic experience. I hope it comes 
      off.
