          <p>"I'm a problem-oriented composer," said Brian Ferneyhough at Inventions: 
            Ferneyhough in Focus, a day of concerts showcasing his work alongside 
            that of composers he has influenced. He was speaking to us by way 
            of a filmed interview, his face hovering like a shaggy-haired deity 
            over the Queen Elizabeth Hall auditorium as the London Sinfonietta 
            noisily re-set the platform between pieces. Given his reputation for 
            complexity, his comment caused polite titters among the audience. 
          </p>
          <p>The centrepiece was the UK premiere of Seven Tableaux Vivants, a 
            scene from his music theatre work Shadowtime, which receives its premiere 
            in Munich in May. Ferneyhough's subject is Walter Benjamin, the German-Jewish 
            writer who committed suicide in 1940 while fleeing the Nazis and who 
            subsequently became an intellectual icon for the post-war German left. 
            Refusing to describe Shadowtime as an opera, Ferneyhough calls it 
            "a theatrical representation of the afterlife of Walter Benjamin's 
            ideas". This sounds deadly, though the music is anything but. </p>
          <p>The Tableaux Vivants essentially link Benjamin with other inter-war 
            Austro-German artists whose work was proscribed by the Nazis. Poems 
            by seven of Benjamin's favourite writers are declaimed sprechstimme 
            (between speaking and singing) by a narrator (here, Roderick Williams) 
            after the fashion of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire over sparsely beautiful 
            textures that flow from one instrumental section to another. At one 
            point a clarinet begins to pick out the basic note row of Berg's Lulu. 
          </p>
          <p>Time alone will tell whether this can work as music theatre, but 
            the score has a lucid immediacy that sets it apart from other Ferneyhough 
            pieces we heard during the course of the day - the austere Incipits 
            and the clamorous, Piranesi-inspired Carceri d'Invenzione 1. The sensuality 
            that Ferneyhough's music occasionally lacks was supplied by pieces 
            by other composers, most notably Morgan Hayes's Dark Room - a sexy, 
            very operatic clarinet concerto - and Dai Fujikura's Fifth Station, 
            a ferocious sequence of dialogues for an on-stage cellist and instrumentalists 
            placed around the auditorium. Under Martyn Brabbins, the London Sinfonietta 
            played with tremendous clarity and brilliance. </p>
