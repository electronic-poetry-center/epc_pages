      <b>WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE OPERA: <br>
      FERNEYHOUGH'S &quot;SHADOWTIME&quot; PREMIERES IN MUNICH </b>
<p><b>Wolfgang Schreiber</b>, <i>S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung,</i> 27 May 2004</p>
      <p> I recall the first encounter with him, thirty years ago at the Avantgarde-Music 
        Festival of Royan, on France's Atlantic coast: The young Englishman Brian 
        Ferneyhough, 31, from Coventry, began to emerge as an outstanding musician 
        of his generation. And that he is -- a modern stylist on the tracks of 
        Schoenberg-Webern-Boulez, who, despite beginnings in postmodernism, is 
        a composer and musical thinker who pursues great density of expression 
        and a blazing constructivism.</p>
      <p>Serious, with an expansive intellect and an eloquent compositional craft, 
        this student of Karl Huber in Basel was defending his ideas even then 
        at that hardly overflowing festival of world premieres, but his works 
        commanded immediate attention. The following year, listening to his 45-minute 
        string quartet, this listener excitedly scribbled: &quot;&#133;Startlingly 
        concise feats of harmonization.&quot; Then, in 1986, there was an entire 
        concert dedicated to Ferneyhough-the seven-part cycle <i>Carceri d'invenzione 
        </i>(Dungeon of Invention).</p>
      <p>And now Brian Ferneyhough in 2004, as opera composer at the Munich Biennial? 
        The conciseness, the precision is unchanged. At the world premiere of 
        his opera <i>Shadowtime</i> -- which is more of a scenic lab experiment 
        dedicated to 20th century intellectual icon Walter Benjamin -- it was 
        only a few measures before the music, resonant with the composer's presence 
        of mind, made absolutely clear that Ferneyhough will not limit his expectations 
        of himself, nor does he intend to restrain his fiery will to artistic 
        expression. A glance at the libretto and the seven sections of the score 
        confirmed it: We are not observing a narrative opera, but we are engaged 
        by a philosophically sound &quot;opera of thought.&quot; Indeed, the German 
        Press Agency would proclaim on the following day that the work lacks &quot;sensuality.&quot;</p>
      <p>Ferneyhough labored five long years, while teaching at the famed Stanford 
        University in California, to complete the seven parts of Shadowtime. His 
        topic is our past: the tragic figure, the way of life, and the conflicting 
        function of the European intellectual of the 20th century as embodied 
        in the German-Jewish cultural philosopher Walter Benjamin. Superficially, 
        the opera is centered on the final moment of Benjamin's life -- it is 
        the year 1940, and as Benjamin flees the Nazis via France and continues 
        on to Spain, heading to the United States, he is stopped at the Spanish 
        border and escapes deportation through suicide. Critical to the opera 
        is what occurs within that moment, in the wide-ranging interplay of characters, 
        texts, symbols, and sounds.</p>
      <p>It begins with an outline of the time, the situation of a refugee who 
        looks back on his life. Layers are interlaced: reflective episodes and 
        periods of redemption and release, featuring Benjamin's friend, the religious 
        philosopher Gershom Scholem, and H&ouml;lderlin as authorities. With diverse 
        rhythmic formulas and units, the American poet and literary theorist Charles 
        Bernstein has created a libretto of poetic-philosophical language that 
        allowed Ferneyhough something essential: the freely permutational use 
        of texts and contexts.</p>
      <p><b>Out of a Great Mystery</b></p>
      <p>Exemplary of Ferneyhough's approach is the thoughtful character of Benjamin, 
        especially in its prismatic richness of aspects and meanings. Sort of 
        how Gershom Scholem saw him: &quot;What Benjamin said and wrote sounded 
        as if it came out of a great mystery -- his power, however, came from 
        evidence.&quot; For two hours, Ferneyhough tracks down mystery and evidence, 
        and it is to this relentless pursuit that the opera owes its darkly hypnotic, 
        dreamy, and puzzling quality.</p>
      <p>It would be impossible to briefly describe what takes place in the sounds 
        and images of this work-manifold in the succession of perspectives, in 
        text and meanings, between life and memory, words, sounds, suggestion. 
        The preparation for death follows Benjamin's fictitious descent into the 
        underworld, where his questioning of his contemporaries is set in a concentrated 
        European vocal polyphony so intricate as to be, possibly, without precedent. 
        The &quot;Angel of History,&quot; after Paul Klee, plays a central role 
        in the super-elevation of the tragedy. It is the books and their fates, 
        the rituals of memory and death; it is the unfathomable strangeness that 
        appears in word, sound, and projected image.</p>
      <p>It is a wonder that the Shadowtime-kaleidoscope conveys any dramatic 
        unity at all. There is the grand, crazily virtuosic piano solo of Part 
        IV (Nicolas Hodges), intended as a vision of Las Vegas as the gate to 
        the netherworld. Luckily there are the purely vocal sections performed 
        by the Ensemble der Neuen Vocalsolisten Stuttgart (Ensemble of New Vocal 
        Soloists Stuttgart). They realize the monstrously elaborate score with 
        extraordinary rhythmic and dynamic precision. And the musicians of the 
        Nieuw Ensemble Amsterdam, under the baton of the sensationally analytical 
        and ambitious Jurjen Hempel, provide optimal clarity and luminosity. The 
        final passages breathe with the beauty of the most complex bel canto style.</p>
      <p>That one perceives musical and theatrical unity is largely due to the 
        patient, purposeful direction of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Fisbach. In witty, 
        animated scenes of Emmanuel Clolus, Fisbach lets caution prevail in the 
        portrayal of a sad &quot;Hero&quot; (played by Ekkehard Abele as the Cipher 
        of Waiting and Faithfulness). The last part (&quot;Stelae for Lost Time&quot;) 
        is magnificent -- an extravagantly beautiful movement for voices, a sound 
        and light crescendo of weightless mourning.</p>
      <p>Can one say that the passion for thought and the profound musicality 
        of this work obstruct its &quot;sensuality&quot;? Yes, one can. But there 
        is pure artistic fervor here, and it is gripping. If the listener can 
        forget about plots -- like the ones that novels, films, and operas tend 
        to have in order to be understood -- he will embark on a musical adventure 
        of the most artful complexity, freed from all expectation. Even if, as 
        in this production, the matter of conveying the text to the listener still 
        needs work.</p>
      <p>In any case, there was much applause in the Prinzregententheater and 
        no howls of protest. After the premiere, Peter Ruzicka compared this piece 
        to Helmut Lachenmann's epic <i>M&auml;dchen mit den Schwefelh&ouml;lzern</i>. 
        And rightly so. Brian Ferneyhough's opera is an apex of modern operatic 
        artistry, and the greatest co-production of the Biennial to date. Performances 
        are booked in London, Paris, New York, and at the Ruhrtriennale. A incredible 
        finale for the Munich music theater festival.</p>
