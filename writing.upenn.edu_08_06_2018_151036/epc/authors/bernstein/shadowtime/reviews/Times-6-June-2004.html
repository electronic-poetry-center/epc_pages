      <p><b><font size="4">Opera: Mind over matter <br>
        Ferneyhough&#146;s debut opera stimulates the intellect but leaves passions 
        unstirred,<br>
        </font></b><b><font size="4">says Paul Driver<br>

        Post-war composers have not always been inclined to opera. Messiaen waited 
        till nearly 70 to write one, Carter till 90, and Stockhausen till he was 
        in his fifties, though, admittedly, he then wrote seven. Boulez, who once 
        said that opera houses should be burnt, still hasn&#146;t produced one; 
        and, clearly, the more strident a modernist you are, the more inimical 
        this quintessential 19th-century form will seem, even if Boulez has proved 
        himself a revelatory conductor of Wagner&#146;s Ring. Brian Ferneyhough 
        (b 1943) has long been Britain&#146;s most audacious avant-gardist, and 
        if anyone was averse to the form, one would swear it was he. Yet I&#146;ve 
        just attended the premiere of his opera Shadowtime, given at the Ninth 
        Munich Biennale, a production due at Sadler&#146;s Wells next year. </p>
      <p>There is no need to worry, however. This is far from being opera in a 
        conventional sense, though it could be described as a dramatic madrigal. 
        Whatever it is, it is in seven scenes and about the death of the German-Jewish 
        cultural philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892-1940). Marxist and hermeneuticist, 
        bibliophile and prophet of the media age, this saturnine figure could 
        stand as the intellectual&#146;s intellectual. For Ferneyhough and his 
        librettist, the American &#147;language poet&#148; Charles Bernstein, 
        he stands at the dark heart of modernity, embodying its contradictions, 
        enacting its demise. When he committed suicide at the French-Spanish border 
        after being stopped in his flight to America, he symbolised, in Ferneyhough&#146;s 
        view, the tragic failure of the European intelligentsia as a whole to 
        resist the Nazis. </p>
      <p>In the face of such a capitulation, intellectuals such as Ferneyhough 
        can only go on intellectualising, though in full awareness of the futility 
        of the task. Hence the im- possible complexity of his musical idiom, in 
        which no detail is too small to be calibrated, no amount of it too large 
        to be crammed into a bar. Whatever one may think of Shadowtime, its launch 
        at the Prinzregententheater was a triumph for his perverse persistence 
        with modernism in its most unregenerate form. It is apt it should be in 
        Germany, where the appetite for such high-brow excursions is undiminished, 
        and even the U-Bahn Muzak will be a Mozart concerto. </p>
      <p>Benjamin&#146;s experience at the border is the basis of Scene 1, the 
        only one to offer any kind of realism, an offer declined, however, by 
        the director Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Fisbach. The exchanges between the 
        characters were hard to distinguish, yet Bernstein&#146;s tricksy linguistic 
        permutations were only getting going and might have been intelligible 
        if any sung words had been so in this unsurtitled staging. (Slices of 
        libretto occasionally dropped from the flies.) It hardly helped that the 
        characters were all members of the chorus, Neue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart, 
        in similar red wigs. Benjamin himself (Ekkehard Abele) stood out only 
        to a degree. Very little solo singing takes place, and the choral writing, 
        though beautiful in its wrought way, is rather samey. </p>
      <p>Benjamin dies at the end of the scene and his avatars in the Beyond take 
        surprising forms. The wordless Scene 2 is conceived as a guitar concerto 
        (Mats Scheidegger) of fragments so fleeting that only angels could make 
        them out &#151; angels and fragments both being Benjamin preoccupations. 
        Scene 4 is a prodigious solo for a pianist in the underworld of a Las 
        Vegas nightclub, who keeps up an &#147;epistemological&#148; patter as 
        he plays. Nicolas Hodges did this brilliantly, and he emerged with his 
        acting and even singing elsewhere a startling all-rounder. </p>
      <p>He was the reciter in the sixth scene, Seven Tableaux Vivants, which 
        bring Bernstein&#146;s allusive word games to the fore but did not here 
        amount to much in the way of tableaux. In the spirit of Benjamin&#146;s 
        friend Brecht, the staging refuses to enchant, preferring bareness &#151; 
        though there is a dangling clutter of quasi-baroque &#147;emblems&#148; 
        (Hitler, Einstein, a Cerberus with the heads of Groucho and Karl Marx) 
        &#151; and the wings are exposed by the end, as though the theatre has 
        become a ruin. The final scene, Stelae for Failed Time, dispensing with 
        the players (Nieuw Ensemble, Amsterdam), is for choir and an electronic 
        transformation of the composer&#146;s voice. A language of his own invention 
        is also used, in case we&#146;d been starting to glean sense from the 
        foregoing. The opera fades into the shadows, ending as self- effacingly 
        as it began. </p>
      <p>It is an interesting, all-too- interesting piece &#151; somewhat reminiscent 
        of Stockhausen&#146;s operas &#151; but it desires more than it delivers. 
        Meaning is so densely packed in layers that little can get through. It 
        is an abstract idea of an opera rather than the thing itself, an opera 
        of abstract rather than musical ideas. The latter could be memorable (as 
        in the writing for three clarinettists) and the conductor, Jurjen Hempel, 
        did a fine job. But I came away with too much going on in my mind, not 
        enough in my solar plexus. <br>
