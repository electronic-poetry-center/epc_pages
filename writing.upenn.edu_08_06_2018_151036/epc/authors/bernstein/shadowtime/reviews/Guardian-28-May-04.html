Ferneyhough, who turned 60 last year, is increasingly the prophet without honour 
in his own country. Born in Coventry, he has lived abroad for more than 30 
years, first in Holland and Germany, and since 1987 in California. That's the 
main reason why British performances of his demanding works have been sporadic, 
while across Europe he is recognised as one of the most important composers of 
our time. The premiere of Shadowtime, Ferneyhough's first stage work, was the 
most eagerly anticipated event in this year's Munich Biennale, the festival of 
music theatre founded by Hans Werner Henze in 1987. 
<P>Whether Ferneyhough has produced a theatre piece at all, though, let alone an 
opera in any conventional sense, is doubtful. There's a libretto, by the 
American poet Charles Bernstein, and also one scene, the prologue, with the 
outlines of a realistic narrative. But the rest of Shadowtime is a cycle of 
independent pieces - the second a guitar concerto, for instance, the fourth a 
work for reciting pianist - most of which have already been performed in 
concert. All relate in some way to the death and legacy of the Frankfurt-school 
philosopher Walter Benjamin, who killed himself on the Franco-Spanish border in 
1940 after fleeing the Nazis and being prevented from crossing into Spain. 
<P>The composer compares the two-hour work to a 17th-century Rappresentazione, 
in which dramatic scenes, philosophical or religious meditations and musical 
interludes were all interleaved. But only two of his seven sections are dramatic 
in any sense. Apart from the prologue - New Angels/Transient Failure - which 
ends with Benjamin's death, only the sixth part, Pools of Darkness (11 
Interrogations), has real theatrical content, as well as some vocal writing that 
is almost conventionally operatic. The rest is a typical Ferneyhough labyrinth 
of impacted musical surfaces, intricate structural conceits and literary 
allusions bound together by music of wonderful detail, with sometimes an 
extraordinarily powerful charge. Beneath his tangled modernist rigour 
Ferneyhough hides a passionate commitment to expression. 
<P>The Munich production by Fréderic Fisbach (due to come to Sadler's Wells in 
September next year) works hard but not always successfully to create a 
theatrical context for the whole work, but then an opera house is the wrong 
place for it. Shadowtime's future is in the concert hall, where most of its 
elements sit most comfortably, and where the theatrical moments could be 
introduced quite naturally. That environment, too, would point up the superb 
quality of the musical performances under Jurjen Hempel - the Nieuw Ensemble 
Amsterdam and the Neue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart singing the vocal roles, and 
Nicolas Hodges as the reciting pianist revealing a unsuspected gift for dead-pan 
humour.
