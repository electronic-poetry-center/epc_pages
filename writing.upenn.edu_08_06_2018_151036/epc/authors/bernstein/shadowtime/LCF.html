      <p><font color="#666666" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Shadowtime</b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> is a &quot;thought opera&quot; based on the work and life of Walter Benjamin (1892-1940). Benjamin is one of the greatest philosophers and cultural critics of the twentieth century. Born in Berlin, he died on the Spanish border while trying to escape the fate that awaited most of his fellow Central European Jews. In its seven scenes, <font color="#666666"><b>Shadowtime</b></font> explores some of the major themes of Benjamin's work, including the intertwined natures of history, time, transience, timelessness, language, and melancholy; the possibilities for a transformational leftist politics; the interconnectivity of language, things, and cosmos; and the role of dialectical materiality, aura, interpretation, and translation in art. Beginning on the last evening of Benjamin's life, <font color="#666666"><b>Shadowtime</b></font> projects an alternative course for what happened on that fateful night. Opening onto a world of shades, of ghosts, of the dead, Shadowtime inhabits a period in human history in which the light flickered and then failed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Andrew Porter writes in <i>TLS</i>: &quot;Ferneyhough creat[es] music from thoughts of Benjamin (and much else) with exuberance, generosity, mastery. Wonderful sounds, musical moves that tell, technical exigence turned to eloquence: <b>I listened spellbound</b>.&quot; David Patrick Stearns calls the opera &quot;<b>a monument to the constructive poweres of the mind</b>&quot; in the <i>Philadelpia Inquirer</i>. Fred Kirchit, in the <i>NY Sun</i> calls <font color="#666666"><b>Shadowtime</b></font> &quot;<b>one of the brightest presentations of contemporary music</b> this season.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Wolfgang Schreiber, in <i>S&uuml;ddeutsche 
            Zeitung</i>, calls <font color="#666666"><b>Shadowtime</b></font></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>&quot;darkly hypnotic.&quot; 
        </b>Brian Ferneyhough is &quot; ... an <b>outstanding musician of his 
            generation </b>... a modern stylist on the tracks of Schoenberg-Webern-Boulez, 
            who, despite beginnings in postmodernism, is a composer and musical thinker 
            who pursues great density of expression and a blazing constructivism. 
            ... There is <b>pure artistic fervor</b> here, and it is gripping. ... 
            a musical adventure of the most artful complexity, freed from all expectation. 
            ... Brian Ferneyhough's opera is an <b>apex of modern operatic artistry</b>, 
            and the greatest co-production of the Biennial to date. <br>

      and Vision</i>, says &quot;Bernstein's libretto, plain and simple, is <b>the finest contemporary libretto that I know of.</b>&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Andrew Clements, in <i>The 
        Guardian,</i> writes that <font color="#666666"><b>Shadowtime </b></font> 
        has &quot;music of<b> wonderful detail</b>, with sometimes an <b>extraordinarily 
        powerful charge.</b> Beneath his tangled modernist rigour Ferneyhough 
        hides a passionate commitment to expression.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">John Warnaby, in <i>Sight 
        &amp; Sound, </i>declares that &quot;<font color="#666666"><b>Shadowtime</b></font> 
        is Ferneyhough&#146;s unique contribution to music-theatre: essentially<b> 
        his magnum opus</b>, incorporating most of the fundamental elements of 
        his creative imagination.&quot;</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Keith Potter in <i>The Indpendent</i> (London), prasises onductor Jurjen Hempel; &quot;the singing and the playing 
        of an 18-piece ensemble appeared of a <b>uncommonly high standard</b>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Von Claus Spahn, in <i>Die 
        Zeit</i>, says, &quot;Ferneyhough takes on <b>the absolute challenge </b>(and 
        extraordinary demand) of <b>music as an intellectual force</b>. He take 
        up the inheritance of Anton Webern and the serialists. He insists on material 
        progress for the medium.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Commissioned by the Munich Biennale, <font color="#666666"><b>Shadowtime</b></font> has its world premiere in May 2004 and soon after was featured at the Festival D'Automne.
