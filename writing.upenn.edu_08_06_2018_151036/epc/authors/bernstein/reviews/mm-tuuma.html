      <P align=justify>This past summer, I went up from London to Cambridge with 
        friends to hear James Tate and John Ashbery read poems at Jesus College. 
        This was a poetry reading competing with the finals of the World Cup, 
        so I was not surprised to find a small audience of thirty or so, many 
        of them poets themselves, some of them joking a little about the scheduling 
        conflict in the way that one jokes about the inevitable with a proper 
        groan. Of course all of these people are here for a reason, I thought, 
        or rather a variety of reasons. These would include interest in and curiosity 
        about the event and the desire to hear poems previously encountered on 
        the page. Maybe some had heard one of the Americans read another time 
        and wanted a chance to witness and hear another performance of familiar 
        work. Tate had not been announced as part of the program so the fact of 
        his poetry having recently acquired a British publisher is unimportant, 
        but Ashbery's latest book was also just out and thus there was new work 
        to be heard, though in some twenty years of poetry readings I have never 
        heard this used as a reason for getting out to one. A sense of duty to 
        poetry itself--that august art besieged by apathy--was also a factor, 
        perhaps, if unexpressed, and for two or three in the room the need to 
        honor old friendships or literary alliances. 
      <P align=justify>Adding to the diffuse atmospherics of old stone and wood 
        in the dimly lit room that overcast evening was a reading lamp atop the 
        table up front, the sole source of non-natural and thereby nondwindling 
        light. After a word or two by way of introduction from Kevin Nolan, it 
        <B>[End Page 153]</B> occurred to Tate, at about the same moment it occurred 
        to me, that he was destined to conduct this reading sitting down behind 
        this lamp. "I'm used to reading standing up but I guess I'll just sit 
        here," he said, or something like that, the awkwardness of this arrangement 
        for him obvious. That awkwardness was produced by the configuration of 
        a site which could only suggest cloistered or private, subvocal reading. 
        Tate's momentary defeat in contemplating this setting became the primary 
        content, the most lasting impression, of his reading as I sat in the back 
        not quite able to see his face, just a little anxious for the main attraction 
        to come on. 
      <P align=justify>My mind wandered to memories of other readings. Just a 
        few months earlier one of the British poets present in the room, Tom Raworth, 
        had read at my own institution in Ohio to a much larger undergraduate 
        crowd mostly required to attend. He'd begun with a poem called "University 
        Days," which in its print incarnation has the words "this poem has been 
        removed for further study" set in the lines of a narrow box, as if a museum 
        placard. He'd ended with "Poem Poem," which consists of the slow and tinkling 
        tones of a Parisian music box playing the punched out words of the title, 
        the low tech music strangely eerie and beautiful moving out across the 
        carpet--even while I knew it might have been motivated by a similar critique 
        of the confining frames of the "poetic." Between "University Days" and 
        "Poem Poem" there had been a long poem consisting of syntactically fragmented 
        sentences of quotidian observation and proposition, read at a speed that 
        helped the poem gather a force and affect that one undergraduate, noting 
        also the poet's dress, accent, and slightly reddened complexion, tried 
        to capture for me by saying, "Wow, he's really angry." Having read this 
        poem and played his machine, Raworth quietly added that he found most 
        poetry readings boring and left the podium. 
      <P align=justify>Sitting there in Cambridge, then, I was remembering those 
        words and thinking about better and worse poetry readings I'd been present 
        for, trying to find some language to explain what accounted for the difference--for 
        me anyway. Though there's more than a little the readings I've mentioned 
        have in common, they were also worlds apart, the one cozy as an old chair, 
        the other on the edge of bewilderment and confrontation. Ashbery's reading 
        that evening--he like Tate obliged to sit behind the table--took on distinction 
        and specificity for me about two-thirds of the way through when, while 
        reading recent poems, the discursive profusion of the poems being uttered 
        in a hushed monotone was counterpointed by the admission or accident--no 
        way of speculating without having <I>read</I> the poems--of sudden pauses 
        or silences of uneven duration mid-poem, as if the poet had somehow lost 
        his place. The nature and effect of those pauses entered the semi-public 
        discussion of the performance afterwards, as champagne was uncorked in 
        an elegant study. Thus, for better or worse, they came to constitute the 
        only critical account of the reading we are likely to have except for 
        this one, which has been influenced by that same discussion. 
      <P align=justify>I am now left to wonder: how can I write of all of this 
        except anecdotally or impressionistically? Would it be possible or even 
        desirable to develop and extend a critical vocabulary such that one might 
        have a conversation about the performance or public reading of poetry? 
        What would count as criteria? And how many of those criteria would involve 
        matters not only beyond the text as ink and writing but also beyond the 
        dimensions and purposes of the sounded word? How many of them would involve 
        the nature or presentation of the performance site and the poet's alertness 
        to its limits and ability either to resist or respond to these limits 
        along with the expectations of the audience present? How many of them 
        would involve only the company I was keeping? Would there be any way in 
        which it would be possible to speak of the (visual) <I>spectacle</I> of 
        these readings? How could I explain the experience of Jimmy Santiago Baca 
        compounding a fumbling reading of a long poem he seemed bored to be reading 
        with stories of meeting Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, stories 
        transparently designed to impress undergraduates? How to compare that 
        with the affect generated by the siren-tones of Leslie Scalapino's calm 
        and mellifluous voice reading her poems' recursive probings of urban experience? 
        What about Amiri Baraka beating on the podium and humming a few bars of 
        "So <B>[End Page 154]</B> What" before launching a poem, or Frank Bidart's 
        facial contortions while reading in a darkened theater's cone of light 
        a poem inhabiting the persona of Nijinsky on the edge of madness? Is an 
        eighty year old J. V. Cunningham prefacing each poem by announcing its 
        metrical scheme really doing the same thing as cris cheek stalking the 
        stage with hand-held speakers wafting Madagascarian music while uttering 
        the memorized lines of a text echoing and subverting fragments of <I>Robinson 
        Crusoe?</I> 
      <P align=justify>In his introduction to <I>Close Listening,</I> Charles 
        Bernstein argues, 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <!--_extract-->
        In an age of spectacle and high drama, the anti-expressivist poetry reading 
        stands out as an oasis of low technology that is among the least spectaclized 
        events in our public culture. . . . In contrast to theater, where the 
        visual spectacle creates a perceived distance separating viewers from 
        viewed, the emphasis on sound in the poetry reading has the opposite effect--it 
        physically connects the speaker and listener, moving to overcome the self-consciousness 
        of the performance context. Indeed, the anti-expressivist mode of reading 
        works to defeat the theatricality of the performance situation, to allow 
        the listener to enter into a concave acoustic space rather than be pushed 
        back from it. . . . [10-11] 
        <!--_/extract-->
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify>An oasis is always welcome, though sometimes it proves 
        to be mirage. Spectacle, in this usage, conjures Guy Debord's demons of 
        mediatization and manipulation as Bernstein seeks both to defend the value 
        and identify the essence of this medium and activity now ubiquitously 
        present in and beyond academic culture, if rarely discussed. 
      <P align=justify>The poetry reading, in its purest form, is of course "live." 
        Liveness, as performance theorist Philip Auslander reminds us, assumes 
        its value and meaning today against the possibility and existence of the 
        recorded or re-presented--it makes no sense to speak of Greek theater 
        as "live"--which would seem to suggest that, real oasis or only mirage, 
        the desert remains in view at the poetry reading. This is one reason that 
        discourse concerning poetry readings cannot elude politicized and moralized 
        referents, even that deadly self-satisfaction and lilting uplift one fears 
        most at the poetry reading itself. <SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/modernism-modernity/v006/6.1er_bernstein.html#FOOT1" 
      name=REF1>1</A></SUP> Bernstein's poetry reading as oasis does not avoid 
        such referents, distantly echoing critiques of mass culture from the past, 
        though it is possible that what poetry readings need most is a discourse 
        of unabashed pleasure, a defense of the activity as exactly <I>entertaining.</I> 
        Bernstein cedes a lot of ground when he writes that readings are not required 
        or able to compete "with music in terms of its acoustic complexity or 
        rhythmic force, or with theatre in terms of spectacle" (11). The poetry 
        reading looks for its successes elsewhere. What the performance of poetry 
        has especially to offer, he argues, is intimacy, by which he means not 
        the intimacy of a person confessing or speaking <I>as</I> person but the 
        intimacy of aurality as it binds performer and audience, the intimacy 
        of a non-theatrical "sounding of the writing." Not wanting to limit aurality 
        in what some have called the era of "secondary orality," he writes that 
        "<I>Aurality precedes orality,</I> just as language precedes speech. Aurality 
        is connected to the body--what the mouth and tongue and vocal chords enact--not 
        the presence of the poet. . . . The poetry reading enacts the poem not 
        the poet" (13; author's emphasis). <SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/modernism-modernity/v006/6.1er_bernstein.html#FOOT2" 
      name=REF2>2</A></SUP> 
      <P align=justify>His is, Bernstein admits, a formalist approach to the poetry 
        reading, though he will acknowledge that the study of the social and institutional 
        function of the poetry reading might also be expanded. His term "anti-expressivist" 
        means to identify a specific mode of reading and performance that goes 
        to the essence of the medium; Bernstein knows that other modes have been 
        employed and continue to exist. As someone who once rang a tiny bell between 
        sections of a long poem he performed for an audience consisting primarily 
        of other "experimental" poets, he surely knows of (and is capable of satirizing) 
        varieties of theatricality beyond the rotund vocal posturing which we 
        associate with actors reading poems or the vocal gymnastics of Dylan Thomas. 
        But because the essays he has collected hope not only to contribute to 
        the <B>[End Page 155]</B> study of a neglected subject, poetry in and 
        as performance, but also to "fundamentally transform" (4) our thinking 
        about the sounding of poetry and "the contribution of sound to meaning" 
        (5), his emphasis on the acoustic intimacies of the poetry reading seems 
        appropriate. 
      <P align=justify>Among the best essays in the volume are those offering 
        critical frames allowing us to think once again, as we haven't thought 
        for some time now in the wake of Jacques Derrida and others, about "sound 
        as material, where sound is neither arbitrary nor secondary but constitutive" 
        (4). Nudging the New Critics aside, but perhaps also remembering their 
        attention to poetry, Bernstein's "close listening" invites discussion 
        of matters such as the cognitive differences distinguishing speech and 
        sound perception (Bernstein on Reuven Tsur); the distinction between listening 
        and hearing (Jed Rasula); the legacies and limits of Roman Jakobson's 
        and others' sound symbolism (Bernstein; Peter Middleton); the social and 
        political possibilities and consequences of "noise" and the "emancipation 
        of sound" (74) from pedestrian functionality (Bruce Andrews); the history 
        of avant-gardists reading the "sheer physicality" (21) of poetry's voiced 
        or technologically-assisted auralities and their extrasemantic, alogical 
        force from within discourses as various as Hugo Ball's mysticism and Georges 
        Bataille's "general economy" (Steve McCaffery). Close listening will also 
        teach us, Bernstein writes, the limits of most prosodic systems, which 
        involve their reliance on "context-independent ratios" unresponsive to 
        "the intervallic irruption of acoustic elements not recuperable by monologic 
        analysis"(13). The most extensive discussions of prosody in this book 
        are Jed Rasula's and Marjorie Perloff's; the latter also takes the visual 
        field of the book-page into account together with technologies of font 
        and print. Such matters are more extensively and exclusively Johanna Drucker's 
        subject in an essay called "Visual Performance of the Printed Text," which 
        is generous in its sampling of avant-garde texts from Filippo Marinetti 
        to Ana Hatherly. 
      <P align=justify>The idea of a "theater" or "performance" <I>of</I> and 
        <I>on</I> the page is one of those analogical extensions of "performance," 
        like Judith Butler's use of the word with reference to identity, that 
        Peter Middleton mentions elsewhere, just a little worried about the myriad 
        ways in which the term is recently finding use. One position, evident 
        in some of the essays here and certainly in the decision to include studies 
        of a visual and book-bound poetry, would argue that it is simply impossible 
        for any writer, no matter how monkish, to avoid issues of performance, 
        as every edit and re-edit, every testing of the conventions and frames 
        for presenting even bald text finds language "performing." Attention to 
        the extralexical and extrasemantic aspects of writing and text as well 
        as to the "incidentals of orality (pauses, tonal inflections to pARTs 
        of words, stutters, tongue clicks, erms and ums, sputters and so forth)" 
        <SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/modernism-modernity/v006/6.1er_bernstein.html#FOOT3" 
      name=REF3>3</A></SUP> does distinguish an avant-garde tradition--the "mainstream" 
        position more typically being that sound should be corralled for the purposes 
        of expression, for emphasis and the underscoring of meaning. The page 
        no less than the sounded word must negotiate what can be an ideologically 
        tense and mobile line between focus and distraction, between what Auslander 
        calls the "matrixed" and "non-matrixed" and what Bernstein, following 
        Erving Goffman's frame analysis, writes of as "cued frame" and "disattend 
        track" (5). 
      <P align=justify>Perhaps the dominant framework in the academy for understanding 
        what I will call in reductive shorthand the force of sound in poetry is 
        still Julia Kristeva's post-Lacanian one, here resoundingly rejected for 
        the developmental narrative encoded in its terms; her "presymbolic" is 
        replaced with an "asymbolic" or "heterosymbolic." Bernstein's defense 
        of poetry as performance has little use for pyschoanalysis and understands 
        itself as materialist. It is the ability of particular modes of poetry 
        (especially) to resist the "transparency effect" of familiar speech and 
        writing and thereby to remind us of "our opaqueness to the transhuman 
        world," our deafness to the "nonanimate" that he values (19). The contribution 
        of the essays in this volume to the many questions raised by the sound 
        and sounding of poetry strikes me as considerable, and the poets (most 
        of the essayists are also poets) are able to hold their own against if 
        not altogether trump more influential theorists. Jed Rasula's essay takes 
        up Michel Foucault, <B>[End Page 156]</B> Roland Barthes, Bataille, Jakobson, 
        and Garrett Stewart, for instance, affirming the need to reconsider "oral 
        plenitude" at this point "several decades into the ontological readjustment 
        sponsored by Derrida, purporting to wage holy war on logocentrism" (234). 
      <P align=justify>Speculation and theorizing on the matter and consequences 
        of material sound and human vocalization are far from the only point of 
        interest in these essays, however. After sketching the technological developments 
        that leave poets on one or the other side of the voice preserved in recording, 
        Rasula lingers over the fascinating notations of Alexander Melville Bell, 
        "author of some of the most influential manuals of oratory and elocution 
        in the nineteenth century" (247). Peter Middleton's long essay ranges 
        far beyond questions of sound symbolism and J. H. Prynne's important rejoinder 
        to a literary criticism written under the sign of Ferdinand de Saussure 
        and includes an abbreviated history of the contemporary poetry reading 
        as it emerged from elocution movements and other public and educational 
        practices. The interested reader might supplement this essay with another 
        by Mark Morrisson detailing the importance of the public reading of poetry 
        in Victorian pedagogical reform and the early British modernist period 
        of London's Poetry Society and Harold Monro's Poetry Bookshop. <SUP><A

      name=REF4>4</A></SUP> Middleton is closest to offering a way into the paratextual 
        elements of the poetry reading that I have somewhat provocatively linked 
        with "spectacle" in my opening for his attention to a "reading space" 
        which might involve "talk above the noise of drinkers returning from the 
        bar" as well as "unplanned sound, material objects that insist upon other 
        social purposes, obtrusive failures of attention" and so forth, and he 
        is careful to note that "the contemporary poetry reading is an event deeply 
        marked by the age of consumption" (270). No escape from the desert here, 
        and indeed one might well wonder how it would even be possible to imagine 
        one, given what Auslander, Walter Benjamin and others have taught us about 
        the ability of newer technologies to refocus and reframe the objects (and 
        modes) of our everyday perception. I also admire the thinking about intersubjectivity 
        that leads Middleton to assert that "poetry readings foreground the ordinary 
        processes whereby meanings are produced" (295) while arguing that,

        Instead of thinking of the poem as something that moves around being variously 
        interpreted, read aloud, published in different forms, and generally provoking 
        distinct interpretations, we might be better to think of it as a large 
        heteroclite entity, that mixes texts, people, performances, memories, 
        and other possible affines, in a process that engages many people, perhaps 
        only briefly, over a long period of time, whose outcomes are usually hard 
        to see, and which has no clear boundaries, not the page, the reading, 
        the critical study. [294]

      <P align=justify>The limits of space here are such that I won't attempt 
        more than a cryptic summary of essays in this volume such as Susan Howe's 
        autobiographical tour de force meditation on sound, memory, and identity; 
        Susan Stewart's excursion into Gerard Manley Hopkins in advance and support 
        of the proposition that "the sound of poetry is heard in the way a promise 
        is heard" (46); Bob Perelman's musing on the "talk" as genre and the engagement 
        with and reshaping of its conventions in writer-performers such as David 
        Antin and Steve Benson; or Ron Silliman's polemic in "Who Speaks: Ventriloquism 
        and the Self in the Poetry Reading," an afterword aimed in part at "the 
        ventriloquists of canonization" and insisting upon the need to recognize 
        and find strategies for empowering real and specific readers, authors, 
        and listeners in an era in which "the instrumental language of an absent 
        subject" has become pervasive (361). Other essays include Nick Piombino's 
        exploration of the effect of the "aural ellipsis" in poetry and the utility 
        of D. W. Winnicott's concepts of the transitional object and "holding 
        environment"; the poem might be a "potential space" insofar as "the effect 
        of the 'aural ellipsis' in poetry allows that, at certain points, the 
        poem may exist within an indeterminate site of significant verbal experience 
        that is simultaneously physical and mental, objective and subjective, 
        <B>[End Page 157]</B> heard aloud and read silently, emanating from a 
        specific self yet also from a nonspecific site of identity, coming toward 
        comprehensibility and disintegrating into incoherence" (54). Dennis Tedlock 
        begins in Mayan poetry and ends in Emily Dickinson, reading and raising 
        questions concerning the function of parallel syntactic forms, pairings 
        of words and phrases and the use of complementary metonyms, arguing in 
        the end for a poetics of an anti-systematic "polyphony and translatability." 
        In reading his essay I was reminded of a remark Basil Bunting once made 
        about Dante being superior to Shakespeare for the latter's insistence 
        on casting several times at the same object, and I was left to ponder 
        the absurd proposition (not Tedlock's own) that it made sense to call 
        the Mayans postmodernist rather than modernist. Peter Quartermain's brief 
        essay proposes in passing a continuity between the virtuoso reading of 
        poetry by the actor Theodore Marcuse and the "pataphysical performances" 
        of more recent and self-consciously avant-garde sound poets (219-220). 
        Along the way toward concluding remarks on "the allure of the unsayable" 
        he works to trouble ideas of good or bad reading as of "ideal" or "competent" 
        speakers or listeners while not concealing his investment in a poetics 
        of "coming-into-speech" which would embrace indeterminacy and error, stammering 
        and stuttering. Poetry's life is on the edge of the unsayable, he thinks; 
        we must also remain alert to disjunctions between subvocal and vocal readings; 
        neither good nor bad reading is "wholly possible; either might bring us 
        to the threshold of speech. Strength of vocables: to bind" (228). 
      <P align=justify>I've set aside three essays which belong more consistently 
        or exclusively to literary history, ethnography, or cultural studies. 
        These are Lorenzo Thomas's "Neon Griot: The Functional Role of the Poetry 
        Reading in the Black Arts Movement"; Maria Damon's "Was That 'Different,' 
        'Dissident' or 'Dissonant'? Poetry (n) the Public Spear: Slams, Open Readings, 
        and Dissident Traditions"; and Susan Schultz's "Local Vocals: Hawai'i's 
        Pidgin Literature, Performance, and Postcoloniality." The question raised 
        or implicit in all three essays involves the nature or composition of 
        the audience and thus might be dubbed, after the academic mantra Silliman 
        alludes to in his anti-academic essay, "Who Speaks." All three essays 
        also sit a little uneasily beside Bernstein's introductory discussion 
        of the "social character" and social function of the poetry reading. The 
        poetry reading, Bernstein suggests, is the site where the "audience of 
        poetry consitutes and reconstitutes itself," where it "makes itself visible 
        to itself" (22). Noting that much of the attention to readings in literary 
        history and anecdote has focused on moments when readings provided "a 
        means for poetry to cross over to a wider audience"--such as in the anti-war 
        movement of the 1960s--Bernstein proposes that "the fundamental, social 
        significance of the reading . . . has to do with infrastructure not spectacle" 
        (22-23), which is to say that its social significance resides in its structure 
        as an institution rather than its effects or consequences for an audience 
        not already participating in the institution's life. Just as he is willing 
        to acknowledge that there are more or less theatrical as well as "anti-expressivist" 
        performance styles, Bernstein does acknowledge the value of other kinds 
        of readings (those for a more general audience, for instance, or students), 
        but the outline of his <I>ideal</I> reading describes something close 
        to a workshop of adepts, "foundries" for "creation and exchange" (23) 
        among poets. 
      <P align=justify>This is meant to counter the banal complaint that the audience 
        at some poetry readings is often largely other poets. But if Bernstein 
        is right that readings demonstrate the extent to which poetry is a "socially 
        responsive" and dialogic activity, "one of the most participatory forms 
        in American cultural life" as he enthuses, and not "the activity of isolated 
        individuals writing monological lyrics" (23), we might also do well to 
        wonder to what extent a neo-avant-garde amply represented by the essayists 
        in this volume is content with its audience and willing to subordinate 
        other ends to aesthetic ones. "It is a measure of its significance that 
        it is ignored" (23), Bernstein writes, referring to poetry and its performance 
        both, one supposes, in mildly defiant tones that ultimately amount to 
        special pleading--in these terms my unwritten novel also bears significance. 
        Mark Morrisson's history of verse recitation in England early <B>[End 
        Page 158]</B> in the century shows the extent to which, by comparison, 
        Harold Monro and others surrounding him (such as Ezra Pound) "attempted 
        to tap into the popular practice of verse recitation" as promoted by the 
        Poetry Society in order to promote a modernist poetry. <SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/modernism-modernity/v006/6.1er_bernstein.html#FOOT5" 
      name=REF5>5</A></SUP> Rejection of the "artificiality and visual spectacle 
        of elocution" (32) were also common at the Poetry Society; far from being 
        exclusive to an avant-garde, this was part of an effort to shape and legitimate 
        poetry for the middle classes. Perhaps it is a measure of the security 
        or even middle-class status of such a self-consciously avant-garde practice 
        as the one Bernstein aligns with his ideal reading that the continuing 
        production of poems and readings should be measured and taken as a sign 
        of health rather than the effects or consequences of poetry in and on 
        adjacent (or containing) institutions. It is revealing that there is no 
        essay devoted to the academically-sponsored poetry reading in this book. 
        <SUP><A

      name=REF6>6</A></SUP> 
      <P align=justify>One might read Bernstein's ideal reading either as reflecting 
        resignation <I>or</I> realism about the limits of the medium in a culture 
        clustered in professional groups and hobbies splintering a mass united 
        only by spectacle-blinding mediatization, but it's certain that, in the 
        past just as today, such an ideal reading is far from the only reading. 
        Lorenzo Thomas's essay on the poetry reading in the Black Arts Movement 
        begins in the nineteenth century by discussing the multiple purposes and 
        valences of dialect, and then remembers the self-consciously "low-brow" 
        entertainment of the "poet-performer" movement of 1870-1930 (Will Carleton, 
        Ella Wheeler Wilcox, James Whitcomb Riley, Vachel Lindsay). He notes that 
        Langston Hughes, like Paul Laurence Dunbar, "understood what his audience 
        wanted" (304), meaning by "audience" something other than the professionals 
        and quasi-professionals alluded to in Bernstein's participatory democracy 
        of writers. The purer space and functions imagined by Bernstein pertain 
        less to the history of readings detailed here by Thomas as these involve 
        form and function both. The community-building, political goals of readings 
        by (or organized by) Amiri Baraka and others as part of the Black Arts 
        Movement are closer to the purposes or effects of the Hawaiian poetry 
        readings Susan Schultz discusses in her essay, which begins by admitting 
        that, at first, she felt altogether outside the identity-gathering affirmations 
        being performed and received at a reading she attended, prepared as she 
        was to be "participating in an aesthetic drama" while "almost everyone 
        else was participating in a social one" (343). Thomas's contextualism 
        in identifying different and plural functions for the poetry reading is 
        useful in refusing the nearly discrete categories and the less discreet, 
        if more familiar, valuations implicit in Bernstein's defense of the reading 
        as a medium. Thomas's judicious appraisal of the interaction of the poetry 
        reading with other media is welcome too. He notes the unenthusiastic reception 
        by jazz fans of Kenneth Rexroth's readings to jazz, and the more successful 
        multimedia performance of Charles Mingus's <I>A Modern Symposium of Poetry 
        and Music</I> (1960). He quotes approvingly another scholar arguing that, 
        for Black Arts Movement artists habituated to if sometimes ambivalent 
        about pulpit oratory, "poetry <I>becomes</I> theatre" when read aloud 
        (310; my emphasis). Poets admitting their status as entertainers on the 
        one hand and as community activists on the other; a willingness to compete 
        with other media by inhabiting or hybridizing its forms--all of this seems 
        crowded out of Bernstein's ideal. 
      <P align=justify>No doubt this late in the century the economic success 
        of the "poet-performers" mentioned above might well seem out of reach, 
        though there is an economics of the contemporary poetry reading which 
        goes largely undiscussed in this book, one with shapes and possibilities 
        varying from location to location. (The English critic Andrew Duncan writes 
        recently that "Today, a poet has to perform in public in order to have 
        a career.") <SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/modernism-modernity/v006/6.1er_bernstein.html#FOOT7" 
      name=REF7>7</A></SUP> Most curious about the discourse sustaining what one 
        might call Bernstein's "poetry-reading-essentialism" is his comparative 
        neglect of multimedia creations such as Mingus's or, more recently, Nathaniel 
        Mackey's <I>Strick</I> (poetry and world music) as well as of the performances 
        of poets such as Brian Catling or cris cheek who sometimes mix poetry 
        reading and performance art. (Catling's performance of his text "Cyclops," 
        he writes, "was structured to sound the building, to use its layers <B>[End 
        Page 159]</B> to echo a contrast to the seated audience who faced a vast 
        humming screen, the video projector behind it, impatiently itching the 
        surface. A long lead ran from there through the basement rooms to a handheld 
        video camera." <SUP><A 
      href="http://80-muse.jhu.edu.gate.lib.buffalo.edu:2048/journals/modernism-modernity/v006/6.1er_bernstein.html#FOOT8" 
      name=REF8>8</A></SUP> ) I am certain that Bernstein is aware of such hybrid, 
        multimedia performances, including at the low tech end Tom Raworth's "Poem 
        Poem," but it's hard to see how such phenomena wouldn't be demoted by 
        a hierarchy of values in which a live, untheatrical, and unaccompanied 
        "sounding" of poems is king. Bernstein does hope that proliferating recordings 
        of readings will retune our ears for poetry, and few would disagree, but 
        this is a different matter. What Bernstein is ultimately defending is 
        not performance but poetry, it seems to me, though it is not as if--the 
        entire book surely demonstrates this much--the two can be wholly separated. 
        And his defense is not all that unconventional except insofar as it displaces 
        the scriptural from its position of privilege. 
      <P align=justify>Along some of the same lines sketched above, Maria Damon's 
        provocative essay on poetry slams and open mic readings challenges some 
        of the more "purist" and aestheticist judgments of Bernstein's introduction. 
        Damon's own performance as the voice of progressive cultural studies obliged 
        to reprimand avant-garde and mainstream poetry worlds alike for tacit 
        or overt elitisms shows up just a little awkwardly in the phrase "But 
        dis is de stuff I like," which is several times set off from the continuous 
        type of scholarly paragraphs. This is the refrain as Damon briefly summarizes 
        what it is about "traditional academic critics" (326) as well as avant-gardists 
        and several varieties of left critics that explains their refusal to engage 
        such poetries. Harold Bloom and Helen Vendler are "responding from a narrow 
        conception of what poetry is: the highly crafted, aesthetic transmutation 
        of private emotions into lapidary objects a select audience can, with 
        much specialized training, learn to appreciate" (326). But experimentalists 
        with very different ideas concerning the nature and status of poetry or 
        poetry "appreciation" also believe that poetry reaching for a wider audience 
        typically "suffers a diminution in subtlety and sophistication--the 'lowest 
        common denominator' critique of mass culture theory" (326). The Right 
        finds slams "too public" and aimed "too aggressively" at "mass appeal" 
        (327). The Left finds them "not public enough," already compromised because 
        of the perception or reality of poetry's purportedly eternal status as 
        an elite art--or, after the Frankfurt School, a distraction from or illusory 
        resolution of real and continuing social problems. The avant-garde might 
        object to rhythms and idioms given to use in perpetuating the structures 
        of oppression or vulnerable to co-optation by the regular or the nutty 
        Right, and these would extend beyond textual matters to elements of performance 
        where the theatrical and the charismatic emerge as anxiety-producing. 
        The criteria for success among the slammers, Damon notes, include "a skilled 
        congruence of content, performance, and performer" and "some kind of 'realness'--authenticity 
        at the physical/sonic and metaphysical/emotional-intellectual-spritual 
        levels" (328-329). She's right that visions of the "bullying theatricalism" 
        and amateurish political rant of the slam poet, the pumping of Beat pastiche 
        or some other beat borrowed from Audre Lorde or anybody else who's made 
        it through the anthologies and out into the street, all of this amplified 
        by body-language galore, are based in nothing more than stereotype or 
        "superficial observation" (329). But, alas, I lack evidence--and, here, 
        as elsewhere in the book, I'm not offered much by way of textual versionings 
        of the performances discussed. Damon scores points with a riposte to those 
        who would worry about one dimension of the slam's purported vulgarity, 
        the practice of setting up and advertising the reading as a competition 
        among poets. That's no worse, only more overt, than the competition for 
        jobs, publications, and prestige among other networks of poets in and 
        beyond the academy. True enough, I agreed, and the more subtle competition 
        can be more dangerous, breeding manic networking and titanic powerblocks 
        in all camps. However, a suspect practice cannot be justified only because 
        it is less vicious than another suspect practice. If anything, the slam 
        is more honest about the collapse of a viable evaluative criticism of 
        poetry that would be able to reach carefully across the sometimes artificial 
        divisions now long in place among poetry readers and <B>[End Page 160]</B> 
        poets, among close listeners and those of my students trained by the movies 
        to watch a poet's eyes first. 
      <P align=justify>Damon's anecdotes and analysis should be enough to get 
        us to listen more closely to slam poets and other populist poets, and 
        that itself is quite an accomplishment. She is less convincing when she 
        tries to link such poetries to oral poetries produced before the era of 
        print and capitalism. It won't do to mention, via Daniel Boyarin, a Jewish 
        tradition in place through the Rabinnic period in which "reading" is understood 
        to mean public haranguing, or Gregory Nagy's studies of oral traditions 
        and composition among the Greeks and others. The orality of the poets 
        Damon is studying is on the other side of a technological divide, and 
        one would have to begin (perhaps as Dennis Tedlock does) by showing what 
        has survived and in what form. A study of the influence of the movies 
        and of standup comedy in "live" and mediatized versions might have just 
        as much to offer, but Damon is eager to hear voices otherwise excluded 
        from the so-called public sphere, and she finds these at the slam: that 
        is a large part of her motive. If the empowerment of marginal groups is 
        really the evaluative criteria, we must nevertheless take her at her word 
        when she says "but dis is de stuff I like." I suppose that the idiom might 
        be said to "perform" a solidarity--though my own response to the dynamics 
        of this idiom is to read it uncomfortably against the racialized history 
        of obsolete debates concerning highbrow/lowbrow. 
      <P align=justify>Though I've picked a little at some of the essays in it, 
        I want to stress how useful, timely, and generally excellent this collection 
        of essays is. Just for its ability to reanimate the discussion of sound 
        in poetry it might very well be the most important book on poetry published 
        in some years. In its effort to open the study of poetry in and as performance 
        it has a better chance than earlier, related books (listed in a useful 
        bibliography), some of the most important of which (such as Stephen Vincent 
        and Ellen Zweig's <I>The Poetry Reading: A Contemporary Compendium on 
        Language and Performance</I>) haven't had the benefit of an imprint like 
        Oxford. For that matter, an increased interest in performance studies 
        and, in England, performance or live writing programs can't hurt either. 
        What I miss here beyond the imaginary essays I've mentioned above on the 
        culture and economics of the academic poetry reading and on poetry participating 
        in established or newer multimedia versionings, is a critical language 
        that would help me and others better discuss why I tend to prefer what 
        I prefer, and why I'm right or not to have difficulty even in talking 
        about some readings beside others. 
      <P align=justify>But I don't miss it too much. To return to my opening examples, 
        I'm certain that in Cambridge I much preferred Ashbery to Tate, but would 
        find it hard if not impossible to say that what Tom Raworth did at my 
        institution even bears comparison, though universities were involved in 
        both cases. All three poets meet, perhaps on slightly more even ground, 
        on the page, which is one of the (less often articulated) reasons the 
        page has been and will probably remain for some time the primary site 
        of critical attention. Discussions of poetry in performance will be able 
        to afford the luxury of anecdote for a while yet as scholarship moves 
        on from here, and that does not seem to me a bad thing. 
      <P align=justify>Bernstein's collection provides analysis that should help 
        us at least begin to think more about kinds of readings and the formal 
        and social factors to be considered in writing about or discussing them, 
        and to his credit his own preferences are there for all to see. I will 
        admit that I found these just a little surprising, given the strains of 
        populism and theatricalism I've witnessed at some self-consciously avant-garde 
        events, where I've heard others whisper that Bernstein himself is a frustrated 
        standup comic. The wager of these essays is a very serious one indeed, 
        to the extent that academic capital can be tossed in specific directions 
        and impact the future of an art form. While it is possible, as the English 
        critic Andrew Duncan has argued, that the study of poetry in performance, 
        by scholars and practioners alike, will lead to a "performance academicism" 
        (74) as well as to the devaluation of some good poets inattentive to performance 
        and performance spaces, it is a risk that Bernstein seems prepared to 
        take, if not <B>[End Page 161]</B> without the several cautions that I 
        have outlined above. I'm left to wonder whether the reading in Cambridge, 
        perhaps the product of a refusal to breed "performance academicism" as 
        much as of plain old crusty tradition, might be close to the ideal that 
        Bernstein identifies, and I'll admit that the possibility leaves me a 
        little befuddled.
