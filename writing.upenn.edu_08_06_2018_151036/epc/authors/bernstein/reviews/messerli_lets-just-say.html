      <p><strong> The Possibility of Rectitude </strong></p>
      <p><em> &nbsp;</em>(originally published in <em><i>The New Review </i>2:2 </em>(2005) </p>
      <p> Since his first book publication in 1976, Charles Bernstein has been producing some of the most important poetry and critical thinking about poetry in the United States&mdash;perhaps in the world. Over the years, in 25 books and chapbooks of poetry, according to my account, he has charted both familiar and new territory. His most recent work, <em>Let&rsquo;s Just Say</em>, a short chapbook of just four poems, is as probing and charming as ever, and, although short in length, is strangely as representative of his work as many a longer publication. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;In Particular,&rdquo; beginning with a quote from his son, Felix (&ldquo;I admit that beauty inhales me / but not that I inhale beauty&rdquo;) is typical of Bernstein&rsquo;s appropriation of his own children&rsquo;s and others&rsquo; innocent wisdom. Indeed, in the past few years no other poet I know of has so engaged children&rsquo;s language and play in the context of philosophical investigation. This poem&rsquo;s first line calls up an ordinary image of &ldquo;A black man waiting at a bus stop,&rdquo; and ends some nine pages later with a similarly everyday &ldquo;black woman waiting at bus stop.&rdquo; But in between, through rhyme, oxymoron, and antithesis, it presents us with a world driven by a mad sexual, religious and racial diversity. An adolescent Muslim writes terza rima, a Mongolian imitates Napolean, a Syrian swami appears on Lake Oragami, and a stuttering Iranian is caught up in a blue and gold fog. In its often funny juxtapositions, the poem reveals a strong sense of isolation for its sexual and racial types: there is something terribly sad in the tell-tale somnambulist rehearsing <em>Gypsy</em> followed by &ldquo;A homosexual child in a taxi.&rdquo; The diaspora of &ldquo;In Particular&rdquo; is oddly unparticular and dehumanizing. In a world where anyone from anywhere does what everyone does everywhere&mdash;which we know is the reality of life&mdash;there is no longer any need for racial and sexual stereotypes, but neither is there any thing to cling to, is there any identity remaining. In a world in which a Latvian miner break dances with the coroner, it means little to be either a coroner or a person from the country of Latvia. The black man and woman waiting at the bus stop&mdash;images which in other hands might have begun a commentary on social conditions&mdash;in Bernstein&rsquo;s poem become images of us all. But as in cartoon drawings titled &ldquo;What is missing?&rdquo; we recognize that in this grand cultural and social leveling something perhaps has been lost. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Thank you for Saying Thank You&rdquo; is a brilliant satire on those critics who have claimed Bernstein&rsquo;s poetry and others&rsquo; early connection with &ldquo;Language&rdquo; writing, in its linguistically probing underpinnings, is without emotion. Like those many poets who drearily argue to be completely understood by their readers through the use of &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; language, Bernstein faces the subject head on: &ldquo;This is a totally accessible poem&rdquo; Indeed it is. &ldquo;There is nothing in this poem that is in any way difficult to understand.&rdquo; As Bernstein argues, the poem expresses &ldquo;the feelings of the author: <em>my feelings.</em>&rdquo; The poem is indeed all about &ldquo;communication&rdquo; and celebrates&mdash;as many an academic and would-be best-seller poet argue for&mdash;&ldquo;the triumph of the human imagination amidst pitfalls &amp; calamities.&rdquo; But unlike nearly any of his other poems, Bernstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thank You for Saying Thank You&rdquo; has utterly no emotion, no soul. Without enigma, obviously, there is no wonderment; without anything left to the imagination of the reader, there is no imagination possible. And without any dogma, ideas, or commitment, the poem is not a poem. It is, just as the author proclaims, &ldquo;real.&rdquo; It is not art. </p>
      <p> I have long argued that Bernstein writes some of the best love poetry around. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Just Say&rdquo; is a good example of that genre&mdash;although, as many miss the forest for the trees, some might here miss the subject for the words. The repetition in every line of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say&rdquo; hints that the reader has been plopped down into the middle of some combative discussion in which, since the couple cannot agree, the speaker attempts to find a simpler solution, a ground on which he and the other can begin to build a consensus. But the images following the phrase are anything but simple, are filled with melancholy, insomnia, dreams, hunger, knives in the back, and loss. Yet a sort of peace is reached through language in this short poem: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say that mankind suffers its language,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say that little is gained when nothing is lost.&rdquo; As Bernstein has expressed in his writing time and again, language is necessary, and action needed to be perpetually repeated if there is ever to be the &ldquo;possibility of rectitude.&rdquo; </p>
