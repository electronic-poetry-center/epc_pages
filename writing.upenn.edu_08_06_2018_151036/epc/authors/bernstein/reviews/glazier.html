      <P><A name=MainEssaySection>Charles</A> Bernstein is mostly widely known 
        for his early influence in Language poetry. A loose constellation of experimental 
        writers in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto, Language poetry emerged 
        in the late 1970s and early 1980s and promoted new forms of experimental 
        writing that paid attention to language itself. Much as, in the art world, 
        movements such as Abstract Expressionism called attention to the materiality 
        of their artistic medium, Language poetry engaged a similar task for writing. 
        Exploring some of the overlooked breakthroughs of literary and philosophical 
        predecessors such as Gertrude Stein, the Objectivist poets, and Wittgenstein, 
        Language poetry at times is seen as developing and extending some of the 
        experimentalism of the earlier Black Mountain and New York Schools, particularly 
        as those schools had begun to explore the place of the "I" in the poem. 
        At the center of the emerging school was <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
        magazine, edited by Bernstein and Bruce Andrews. <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
        (from which the movement also got its name) allowed for the circulation 
        of a rich web of essays and literary writings. These writings explored 
        the literary influences, theories, and modes of writing that formed a 
        loose nucleus around which many of these writers conducted their investigations. 
        Bernstein and Andrews edited <I>The <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=E 
        Book</I>, a volume that allowed for the much wider circulation of many 
        of the key essays and writings from the magazine. <I>The L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E 
        Book</I> was instrumental in laying a foundation for a new sense of writing 
        and vividly articulated the multidisciplinary and polytextual sweep of 
        this writing's core investigations. 
      <LI>
        <P>Beyond his highly visible activities at the beginning of Language writing, 
          Bernstein's presence in the world of experimental writing has been consistent 
          and extraordinary. His work has been published in nearly every major 
          experimental magazine over the past two decades; he has been a key voice 
          in many significant conferences. Besides the voluminous amount of poetry 
          he has written, he has been tireless in his devotion to the work of 
          writing. His reviews, essays, and other writings have been influential 
          in championing new voices in literature, in calling attention to overlooked 
          writers from the past, and in exposing the complacent lethargy of what 
          Bernstein calls "official verse culture," that body of conventional 
          opinion that often seems at odds with new possibilities. Now the David 
          Gray Professor of Poetry and Letters at the State University of New 
          York at Buffalo, Bernstein remains a strong literary influence on many 
          through his continued writing and teaching, the many publications published 
          through Buffalo's Poetics program, the Poetics discussion list on the 
          internet (which Bernstein moderates), and the Electronic Poetry Center 
          (for which Bernstein serves as chief advisor). Bernstein has been acclaimed 
          by such important critics as Marjorie Perloff, Jerome McGann, and John 
          Shoptaw; he is a frequent keynote speaker at major literary events, 
          and there are panels about his writing at gatherings such as the Modern 
          Language Association and the Twentieth Century Literature conferences. 
          He continues to be active as both a poet and critic. </P>
        <P>Charles Kegel Bernstein was born on 4 April 1950 in New York City to 
          Herman and Sherry Bernstein. His father worked in the garment industry, 
          mainly as a dress manufacturer. The youngest of three children, Bernstein 
          grew up near Central Park in Manhattan. He attended the Bronx High School 
          of Science and edited the school newspaper. In 1968 he met his future 
          wife, the artist Susan Bee (born Susan Bee Laufer). From 1968 to 1972 
          Bernstein attended Harvard University and was active in the antiwar 
          movement. He concentrated in philosophy, studying with Stanley Cavell 
          and Rogers Albritton. His senior thesis, "Three Compositions on Philosophy 
          and Literature," was a reading of Gertrude Stein's <I>Making of Americans</I> 
          (1925) through Ludwig Wittgenstein's <I>Philosophical Investigations</I> 
          (1953). Some of his thesis has subsequently been published in Richard 
          Kostelanetz's <I>Gertrude Stein Advanced: An Anthology of Criticism 
          </I>(1990). Bernstein edited Harvard's freshman literary magazine and 
          published <I>Writing </I>, a photocopy magazine. He was also actively 
          involved in radical theater, directing several productions. He graduated 
          Phi Beta Kappa in 1972. </P>
        <P>In early 1973 Bernstein won a William Lyon MacKenzie King fellowship, 
          enabling him to move, with Bee, to the Vancouver area. At Simon Fraser 
          University, Bernstein took a seminar on Emily Dickinson with Robin Blaser, 
          an experience that proved influential for him. Following nine months 
          in Vancouver, Bernstein and Bee moved to Santa Barbara where Bernstein 
          worked part-time as a health education coordinator in a community free 
          clinic; his writing from that time would be later published as <I>Asylums</I> 
          (1975) and <I>Disfrutes</I> (1979).Bernstein and Bee moved back to New 
          York in early 1975. They married in New Hampshire in 1977; their children, 
          Emma and Felix, were born in 1985 and 1992, respectively. </P>
        <P>Although he had met poets in Vancouver, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco, 
          where he had traveled to meet Ron Silliman, it was not until his return 
          to New York that Bernstein became fully engaged in poetry as public 
          practice. He met Bruce Andrews shortly after his return, spent much 
          time going to St. Mark's Poetry Project and other New York readings, 
          and in 1978 cofounded with Ted Greenwald the acclaimed Ear Inn series, 
          a significant venue for emerging writers. A compact disk of some of 
          the readings was produced by Bernstein in 1993. </P>
      <P>While Bernstein devoted himself to poetry and poetics, his income was 
      not related to literary activity. For nearly twenty years his living would 
      come from his work as a medical and healthcare editor and writer. In 1977 
      and 1978, for example, he wrote medical abstracts full-time for the 
      Canadian edition of <I>Modern Medicine</I>. In an unpublished August 1995 
      interview he commented that "this immersion in commercial writing and 
      editing--as a social space but more in the technical sense of learning the 
      standardized compositional rules and forms at the most detailed, and 
      numbingly boring, level--was informing in every way." He also noted that 
      he and Bee designed the <I>Health Manpower Consortia Newsletter</I> in the 
      same format that would be later used for 
      <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
      magazine. Bernstein has adapted medical vocabulary for poetic purposes and 
      has, like Stein, Wittgenstein, and the Objectivist poets before him, 
      continued to explore "rules and forms." </P>
      <P>Brought out by his and Bee's Asylum's Press in New York, Bernstein's 
      first two books, <I>Asylums</I> and <I>Parsing</I> (1976), were produced 
      in the manner of such influential publications as <I>Adventures In Poetry, 
      C</I> and <I>The World</I> as side-stapled photocopies of manually typed 
      pages. The poem <A name=asylum>"Asylum,"</A> which Bernstein chose to 
      reprint in <I>Islets/Irritations</I> (1983), begins:

        </BLOCKQUOTE>This poem is striking in several ways. First, the 
      <I>field</I> of the poem, the way the lines look on the page, is 
      constantly shifting, constantly modified. Not only does this repeatedly 
      modified field suggest chaos and a clash of multiple voices and tones, it 
      marks a direct refusal to accept the concept of poetic "order." This poem 
      will not assume tidy stanzas or give the reader the comfort of predictable 
      line lengths. Second, there is no fixed narrative element to this poem. 
      The first line of the poem seems to be the middle of a sentence, and the 
      poem is built from a series of objects and their sounds, which are placed 
      "in line." Third, this poem is dense in its diction; it is hard to read 
      aloud and the words at time seem to clash, butt up against each other, and 
      grate. Last, the poem is about institutions. (The title is a reference to 
      one type of institution; poetry itself is another type.) The reader can 
      feel the artificial pressure and stark reality of the institution 
      throughout this poem. It has "locked doors, high walls, barbed / wire"; 
      the poem "create[s] and sustain[s] / a particular kind of tension." It 
      warns of danger and also speaks of a victory that apparently comes as long 
      as the literal surface tension of the poem can be maintained.

      <P>Critic John Shoptaw describes "Asylum" as "a disturbing poem composed 
      of broken lines unjustly arranged upon the page." Shoptaw asserts that in 
      the poem "Bernstein confronts the objectifying capacity of the list." 
      <I>Asylums</I> also includes an early version of "Out of this Inside," a 
      poem Bernstein later rewrote for <I>Poetic Justice</I> (1979). <A 
      name=_parsing><I>Parsing</I></A> contains two sections--the first, 
      "Sentences," giving way to the second, "Parsing," as sentences break up 
      into phrases. Bernstein's concern for order is evident in "Roseland": 
      "this axis this / the human order / more or less / you have a map." </P>
        <P>In 1978 Bernstein and Bruce Andrews founded <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
          magazine. In "An Interview with Tom Beckett," included in <I>Content's 
          Dream: Essays 1975-1984</I> (1986), Bernstein recalls that the motivation 
          to publish the magazine grew from the exchanges he had in correspondence 
          with Andrews and Silliman. "The impulse for the magazine was to make 
          that kind of exchange ... more public, to share the thinking and conceptualizing 
          with as large a group of people as we could interest." As to the magazine's 
          prose format, Bernstein comments that the project as conceived would 
          have included poetry, reviews, and art, but this was not affordable. 
          The scope of the original vision was eventually realized through a small 
          group of periodicals. "<I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
          was one piece of this larger project," Bernstein suggests, "which to 
          some degree did come into being in a modular way--if you think of <I>This 
          </I>, or <I>Roof</I>, or <I>A Hundred Posters</I> or <I>Tottel</I>'s 
          as other parts." </P>

      was published until 1981. This run encompassed thirteen regular issues, 
      three supplements, an index, and a final number copublished as an issue of 
      the journal <I>Open Letter</I>. Despite its modest format and limited 
      circulation, 
      <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
      has proven to be one of the most influential little magazines of the 
      period. It introduced many writers who have since enjoyed significant 
      recognition as poets and scholars. 
      <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I>

      common in academic and poetic discourse. </P>

      shared a common interest, the magazine was never intended to serve as the 
      center of a literary school or movement. According to Steve McCaffery, 
      "Though many contributors conceived the practice of writing to be 
      primarily a social fact and saw the production of meaning as occupying, 
      with a certain inevitability, a sociopolitical position within the 
      politics of representation, there was never a suggestion of a unitary 
      group of movement." In <I>Content's Dream</I> Bernstein's assertions show 
      him to be uncomfortable with the notion of a 
      <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I>

        and my own work, as expressing certain shared views about reading and 
        about the constituting power of language, about seeing language itself 
        as the medium of the work and foregrounding that medium. And yet this is 
        not a movement in the traditional art sense, since the value of giving 
        an aesthetic line such profile seems counterproductive to the inherent 
        value of the work.</BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>He expresses agreement with Frederic Jameson's statement from <I>The 
      Prison House of Language</I> (1972) that when a literary writing "marks my 
      affiliation with a given social group, it signifies the exclusion of all 
      the others also--in a world of classes and violence, even the most 
      innocuous group-affiliation carries the negative value of aggression with 
      it." </P>

          advanced poetic thought by foregrounding specific interests that stood 
          in opposition to the prevailing academic tastes. "Language writers have 
          used structuralist and poststructuralist theory at times, to furnish 
          ad hoc support for assertions about the problematic status of description, 
          self, and narrative in poetry," Bob Perelman asserts in "Write the Power," 
          "But these positions have come out of writing practices closely informed 
          by the modernists, especially Gertrude Stein, and the Objectivists, 
          especially Louis Zukofsky, and to some extent by the New American poets 
          and the New York school. Thus--to be schematic about it--language writing 
          occupies a middle territory bounded on the one side by poetry as currently 
          instituted in the academy and on the other by theory." As to its position 
          between "the workshop poem's commitment to voice and immediate experience" 
          and the ambiguities of texts generated by "theoretical regimes," Language 
          writing is different in its "foregrounding [of] the activity of writing."

      <P>Bernstein's next three books were published during the 
      <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
      years: <I>Shade</I> (1978), <I>Poetic Justice</I>, and <I>Senses Of 
      Responsibility</I> (1979). These books began to establish his work at the 
      vanguard of experimental writing. <A name=_shade><I>Shade</I></A>, a 
      typescript publication in the style of Bernstein's first two books, enjoys 
      the distinction of being the first book publication of Sun &amp; Moon 
      Press, now a major publisher of avant-garde writing. It includes sixteen 
      poems constructed of short lines that challenge the reader to leap from 
      thought to thought. In "Ballet Russe," for example, Bernstein writes: "I 
      love motion &amp; dancing. / I did not understand God. / I have made 
      mistakes." The jaggedness in the progression of phrases becomes even more 
      emphasized when lines are shorter, as in "The Bean Field": "Yet I / 
      gelatinous mildewy tether / hissing of urn / screech-owl or / this vast. 
      Range / too." </P>
        <P>In contrast to the predominant white space of <I>Shade</I>, Bernstein's 
          <A name=_poeticjustice><I>Poetic Justice</I></A> exhibits a twisting 
          landscape of intermingled prose utterances stretching from margin to 
          margin, as is shown in the following line from "Lo Disfruto": "One a 
          problem with a fragment sitting. Wave I stare as well at that only as 
          if this all and not form letting it but is it." Also present in this 
          collection are works such as "eLecTrIc" and "AZOOT D'PUUND," a poem 
          in which Bernstein experiments with dislocated typography in the spirit 
          of Jackson Mac Low's change permutations:

      this work, it is clear that Bernstein is exploring the permeability of 
      language. What does one see when one can not be lulled into reverie by 
      what the words say? What is the emotional result when capitals and other 
      typographic markers are radically recast? What does the reader get from 
      such typography--is it sound, a visual work, an assault on conservative 
      poetic value? A final and very important point is the question that such 
      texts raise about where a poetic work comes from. Maybe the above 
      characters are intentional. Maybe they occur as a result of errors by the 
      typist. How could one decide?

      <P>One of Bernstein's often cited poems is called <A name=liftoff>"Lift

      diminutive of <I>HRH; seineocpcy</I>, the Seine River; <I>me"ius</I>, a 
      parody of Latin; <I>jeuvine</I>+<I>pee</I>, juvenile plus urination) in a 
      hilarious cacophony and raucous visual clutter. If one of the issues that 
      experimental writing explores is to remove the authorial "I," then this 
      poem is an excursion to a terrain that is purely experimental. If one of 
      the issues is where a poem comes from, this poem not only begs the 
      question but laughs at one for asking since it is a transcription of the 
      correction tape from a self-correcting typewriter. As such it is a 
      primarily poetic work constructed from the literal typographic detritus of 
      other works, both literary and nonliterary. The emphasis on typographical 
      elements in these poems creates texts where, as Shoptaw writes, "the 
      characters themselves sometimes make the music."

        <P>Originally published by Lyn Hejinian's Tuumba Press, <A name=_sensesofresponsibility><I>Senses 
          Of Responsibility</I></A> was reprinted in 1989 by Paradigm Press. This 
          small collection contains six poems made up mostly of short lines, though 
          its sonorous sentences often continue over several lines. Shoptaw has 
          pointed to this collection as showing that Bernstein has "occasionally 
          stopped and hovered over [John] Ashbery's fluid measures." <I>Senses 
          Of Responsibility </I>shows not only Bernstein's consideration of Ashbery's 
          poetics but also his command and translation of them into his own form.

      <P>In 1980 Bernstein received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative 
      Writing Fellowship. Also that year he led a workshop at the Poetry Project 
      at St. Mark's Church in New York, and his works <I>Legend</I> and 
      <I>Controlling Interests</I> were published. In <I>Legend</I> Berntein 
      collaborated with Andrews, Ray DiPalma, McCaffery, and Silliman to explore 
      a wide range of textual presentations. <I>Controlling Interests</I> was a 
      milestone volume in Bernstein's career, the first of his books to present 
      poems in heterogeneous formats. The formal variance of its seventeen 
      poems, ranging from single stanza poems to mixtures of prose and verse in 
      fields of words, foreground an intentional unevenness. </P>
        <P>"Disrupting chronology," Silliman notes in his essay in <I>Controlling 
          Interests</I>, "is a defense against the reduction of poetry to 'mere' 
          autobiography, particularly when the formation of a subject is taken 
          as the persistent content of the work." Bernstein's use of a temporally 
          fragmented authorial subject, Silliman argues, allows him to focus on 
          the "constitutive aspect of language, rather than treating it as a self-forming 
          <I>object</I>." In the "discontinuous units" that comprise this collection, 
          language is foregrounded as subject. Barrett Watten asserts that "The 
          politics of the work are in [Bernstein's] internalization of 'radical 
          structural means'; oppression, seen as an act of language, will be increasingly 
          revealed. 'To push things into further nature' is the impulse; <I>Controlling 
          Interests </I>intends a further statement conceived entirely on the 
          ability to act." <A 
      name=_controllinginterests><I>Controlling Interests</I></A> contains such 
          crucial Bernstein poems as "Matters of Policy," "Sentences My Father 
          Used," and "Standing Target." Writing of "Sentences My Father Used," 
          Perelman maintains: "Language here is investigating itself, proclaiming 
          its opacity, revealing words as code or husk. The bonds of grammar are 
          loosened ... Statement and image half appear and then fade into something 
          other." </P>
      <P>The last issue of 
      <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
      was published in 1981 as were three of Bernstein's books, <I>Disfrutes, 
      The Occurrence of Tune</I>, and <I>Stigma.</I> <A 
      name=_disfrutes><I>Disfrutes</I></A> was written in 1974, published 
      privately in 1979, and then reprinted that same year by Potes &amp; Poets 
      Press. It is an unpaginated, chapbook-sized volume that evokes the 
      alphabet with its twenty-six untitled poems (or sections of a poem). 
      Highly abstract, each poem/page is a single column of text containing one 
      to several words. Phrases, parts of phrases, grammatical parts such as "of 
      it / on / the it / she / on the / it she" make the reader aware of the 
      white space surrounding the words, the silence surrounding language's 
      content. The regularity of the white space or silence is occasionally 
      blurred or broken as certain lines malfunction: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

        <P>th ... b ...rb ...n th ... mb...l ... n ... [.]</P></BLOCKQUOTE>The 
      poems thus suggest an "alphabet" that refuses language's capacity for 
      communication. Shoptaw notes that <I>disfrutes</I> in Spanish means 
      "enjoyment." Alternatively, the poems might be read as the disaffiliated 
      "fruits" of language. 
      <P></P>
      <P>Bernstein collaborated with Susan Bee, who provided photographs, in the 
      creation of <A name=_theoccurrenceoftune><I>The Occurrence of 
      Tune</I></A>. The third line of the text declares that there is "no 
      presence, no things," a statement that in the context of the volume 
      asserts the limitations of concrete reality (what words describe, what 
      images depict) to imply meaning. The altered photographs by Bee contain 
      recognizable images whose familiar meanings are either overpowered or 
      undermined by the manner of their presentation. In Bee's cover for the 
      book, for example, American icons are overbearing despite their physical 
      decay: a run-down fast food restaurant advertising "Frankfurters, Table 
      Service, Fountain, Hamburgers" hovers over a pattern that suggests a 
      highway landscape. Likewise, the text establishes patterns of words that 
      are at odds with "normal" reality by juxtaposing snatches of conversation 
      in quotes, aphoristic declarations, and blocks of prose showing "much 
      flurry, little <I>regard</I>" for standard syntax. </P>
      <P>Consisting of eleven single stanza poems, each headed with a title in 
      bold type, <A name=_stigma><I>Stigma</I></A> presents a more conservative 
      textual format than <I>The Occurrence of Tune</I>. It includes such 
      traditional titles as "New Year's," "December," and <A 
      name=april>"April."</A> This presentation, however, merely serves as a 
      conventional frame from which Bernstein immediately departs. "April," for 
      example, begins:

      juxtaposed words and phrases in the "webbed space" of the poem is neither 
      logical nor predictable. Even as "projected," it breaks down until 
      "haecceity" is invoked. The title word <I>stigma</I> carries the senses of 
      both a mark and a stain. In this collection, it is as if the words 
      themselves stain the text; they are not words but faults that "convene, 
      argue plans, yet point / At any loss, so much, erasing / Our undoing, 
      greatest wildness. Continuous / Focus--shift, blur, become transparent, 
      persists."

        <P>The most important event in the reception of Bernstein's early work 
          was the 1982 publication of the "Charles Bernstein Issue" of <I>The 
          Difficulties</I>, edited by Tom Beckett. The issue included Beckett's 
          interview with Bernstein that was reprinted in <I>Content's Dream </I>(a 
          continuation of this interview was published as "Censers of the Unknown-Margins, 
          Dissent, and the Poetic Horizon" in <I>A Poetics</I> in 1992) as well 
          as critical essays, homages, and poems. The contributors include Silliman, 
          Robert Creeley, Perelman, Jackson Mac Low, Watten, Alan Davies, and 
          others. James Sherry commented on the poet's attempt to reshape thought 
          in language: "sentences reflect the constant intrusion of the world 
          on the mind and the impossibility of meditation/mediation.... Bernstein 
          is not concerned with grammar and sentences as correct ... [but with] 
          ... patterns of thought in the patterns of [his] phrases rather than 
          given standards of the shape of the thought as in the grammatically 
          oriented notion of the sentence." Craig Watson maintains that in Bernstein's 
          work "the apprehension of meaning is not conditioned by substance or 
          continuity alone, but by the constitution of relations in a network 
          of possibility; the object is mediated and named by our whole experience 
          with it. Cognition is made up of a vast circuitry within which language 
          is gestural and continually subjective. Through these circuits we conduct 
          and create our selves, a reality." Perelman writes that "Bernstein's 
          ... language centered writing never fails to be centered around the 
          person, and the pressures of culture and history that thwart language's 
          power." </P>
      <P>The issue also contains twenty-five pages of poems by Bernstein, 
      concluding with <A name=substanceabuse>"Substance Abuse"</A> in which the 
      poem's speaker relates, "I feel (felt) stripped by these / changes, I / 
      don't know what I received and what / I was shut up with" and "I feel like 
      a very nervous man." These sentiments are relevant to the occasion of the 
      special issue, and the poem in this context seems a comment on Bernstein's 
      new level of public prominence: "So these sorrows pronounce themselves / 
      in rhymes before my eyes" and "I make this point because your gazing / at 
      a so projected grouping 'at a / distance' clouds your view--." Bernstein 
      astutely displays the dynamics of what such a recognition does to the 
      speaker: "One / guise disguises itself within myself, / the other within 
      my text." The sounds of these lines echo the sentiments of the speaker: 
      "guise" is within "disguise" as the guise is "within myself." Secondly, 
      the guise "within myself" is repeated by the sound of "within my text." 
      "Myself" and "my text" are parallel elements and reveal their difference 
      only in the disparity between "self" and "text." Near the end of the poem, 
      the speaker says, "Anxious and waiting for something, but not / 
      definable-amorphous. What pans out? / I'm afraid to set it down, to 
      contend with / the medium at hand." In "Substance Abuse," Bernstein 
      purposefully dramatizes the poet's public persona. </P>
      <P>After editing a selection of Language poetry for the <I>Paris 
      Review</I> in 1982, Bernstein the next year brought out two 
      collections--<I> Resistance</I>, a gathering of eighteen hard-edged, 
      densely packed poems, and <I>Islets/Irritations </I>. The poems in <A 
      name=_islets/irritations><I>Islets/Irritations</I></A>--including 
      "Sprocket Damage," "Gradation," "Asylum," and one of Bernstein's 
      best-known poems, "The Klupzy Girl"--are particularly interesting because 
      they display a wide range of poetic form. The title poem, the first in the 
      collection, is an example of a modified field format--the terrain Berstein 
      can establish through his densely packed, often ironic weave of words. Its 
      first two lines indicate how Bernstein uses regular spacing at irregular 
      intervals to form his field: "to proper to behindless weigh in a rotating, 
      / rectilinear our plated, <I>embosserie des petits cochons</I>." He uses a 
      completely different form in the poem "Contradiction Turns To Rivalry" by 
      juxtaposing colorful sentence-length paragraphs: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>On-the-street subjects render fragmented versions; a two-way

      <P>In his 149-line single-stanza poem, <A name=theklupzygirl>"The Klupzy 
      Girl,"</A> Bernstein engages the reader from its opening lines: "Poetry is 
      like a swoon, with this difference: / it brings you to your senses." Early 
      on Bernstein delares, "Not clairvoyance, / predictions, 
      deciphering--enacting," a line that indicates the energy he strives to 
      attain in his dense poem. He juxtaposes diverse voices (including Walter 
      Benjamin's "'There is no document of civilization / that is not at the 
      same time a / document of barbarism'"), lines propelled by clipped grammar 
      ("It has / more to me than please to note acquits / defiant spawn"), and 
      various <I>forms</I> of address:

      <P>Bernstein's next project was to edit <I>The

      (1984), in which he included a selection of work published in 
      <I>L</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>N</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>U</I>=<I>A</I>=<I>G</I>=<I>E</I> 
      magazine. The same year he also published some of his own translations of 
      Claude Royet-Journoud's work from <I>The Maternal Drape</I> (1984). The 
      nearly three-hundred-page <I>The

      about half of the material published in the original magazine. Awarded a 
      John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in 1985, Bernstein attended the 
      New Poetics Colloquium in Vancouver that year. During this period he wrote 
      the essay "Being A Statement On Poetics," later published in <I>Rough 
      Trades</I> (1991). He makes a strong argument for a new poetics, declaring 
      that "A poem should not be but become" and humorously insisting on the 
      poem's social materiality: "The problem / is not the bathwater but the 
      baby. I want / a poem as real as an Orange Julius." </P>
      <P>Bernstein's first essay collection, <A 
      name=_contentsdreamessays19751984><I>Content's Dream: Essays 
      1975-1984</I></A>, contains work that originally appeared in

      such crucial works as "Three or Four Things I Know about Him," "Thought's 
      Measure," "Writing and Method," "Characterization," "Words and Pictures," 
      "The Objects of Meaning: Reading Cavell Reading Wittgenstein," and "Blood 
      on the Cutting Room Floor." As Jerome McGann points out, 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The problem of poetry's relation to prose (and vice versa) 
        is a recurrent preoccupation of Bernstein's work. <I>Content's 
        Dream</I>, for example, is subheaded 'Essays 1975-1984' but the 
        collection itself calls into question the distinction between poetry and 
        prose. 'Three or Four Things I Know About Him' (which opens the 
        collection); 'A Particular Thing'; 'G--'; are these texts poetry or are 
        they prose? It is not easy to say. Similarly, his books of 'poetry' all 
        print texts which do not, for various different reasons, 'look like' 
        poetry at all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P></P>
      <P>Bernstein investigates writing as a practice that is not subordinate to 
      a particular genre. In "Writing and Method" he asserts that "One vision of 
      a constructive writing practice I have, and it can be approached in both 
      poetry and philosophy, is of a multi-discourse text, a work that would 
      involve many different types and styles and modes of language in the same 
      'hyperspace.' Such a textual practice would have a dialogic or polylogic 
      rather than monologic method." In "Thought's Measure" Bernstein argues 
      that "Language is the material of both thinking and writing. We think and 
      write in language, which sets up an intrinsic connection between the two." 
      <I>Content's Dream</I> allows the reader to trace the interweavings of 
      writing and philosophy that inform the poetry that Bernstein writes and 
      admires. He believes that "language is measure. And it is with this that 
      we make our music--by ourselves, privately (if so that the measure's 
      heard)--a private act, a revelation of the public. So that writing that 
      had seemed to distance itself from us by its solitude--opaque, obscure, 
      difficult--now seems by its distance more public, its distance the measure 
      of its music. A privacy in which the self itself disappears and leaves us 
      the world." </P>
        <P>Bernstein also puts forth a precise description of the forces that are 
          at odds with the poetry that attracts him. He refers to the "nexus of 
          poets and critics who enforce norms of poetic value based on transparent 
          language" as "official verse culture." In the essay "The Academy in 
          Peril: William Carlos Williams Meets the MLA" he explains his definition: 
        <BLOCKQUOTE>Let me be specific as to what I mean by "official verse 
        culture"--I am referring to the poetry publishing and reviewing 
        practices of <I>The New York Times, The Nation, American Poetry Review, 
        The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, Poetry</I> (Chicago), 
        <I>Antaeus, Parnassus</I>, Atheneum Press, all the major trade 
        publishers, ... [and most] major university presses.... Add to this the 
        ideologically motivated selection of the vast majority of poets teaching 
        in university writing and literature programs ... as well as the 
        interlocking accreditation of these selections through prizes and awards 
        judged by these same individuals.</BLOCKQUOTE>Bernstein's objection is to 
      "biased, narrowly focussed and frequently shrill and contentious accounts 
      of American poetry, [which claim,] like all disinformation propaganda, to 
      be giving historical or nonpartisan views." 
      <P></P>
      <P>Bernstein's struggle in the arena of literary politics is a major 
      thrust of his work. His premise is that writing is the practice of 
      ideology, not an occupation that uses a transparent or neutral medium. As 
      McGann comments in <I>Black Riders: The Visible Language of Modernism</I> 
      (1993), "Bernstein manipulates the visible and audible features of his 
      work because those features give material shape to the writing's social 
      and intellectual commitments. The writing means to declare its ideological 
      goals." In describing the concerns of Bernstein's writing, McGann uses the 
      phrase "the poet's office," an expression that well fits Bernstein's 
      conception of writing as a political act. Bernstein has edited a volume 
      titled <I>The Politics of Poetic Form: Poetry and Public Policy</I> 
      (1990). In the essay "Optimism and Critical Excess (Process)" in 
      <I>Content's Dream</I> he argues that "Poetics is the continuation of 
      poetry by other means. Just as poetry is the continuation of politics by 
      other means," echoing Silliman's assertion that "Poetry, like war, is the 
      pursuit of politics by other means." In his consideration of Bernstein's 
      <I>A Poetics</I> (1992) in "Write the Power," Perelman argues that 
      "Bernstein frames the book with gestures that make poetry a counter-State 
      or non-State." Such a view of poetry may account for the title of 
      Bernstein's forthcoming collection of poems, "Republics of Reality." </P>
        <P>In 1986 Bernstein received the University of Auckland Foundation Fellowship 
          and became a visiting lecturer in the English department of the New 
          Zealand school, an appointment that enhanced his international reputation 
          and brought him into contact with active New Zealand poets. His sojourn 
          in New Zealand was followed by the publication of several works, including 
          <A name=_veil><I>Veil</I></A> (1987), a work he had written in 1976. 
          The collection is prefaced by a quotation from Nathaniel Hawthorne's 
          story "The Minister's Black Veil": "There is an hour to come ... when 
          all of us shall cast aside our veils. Take it not amiss ... if I wear 
          this piece of crape till then." The "veil" of this book is manifested 
          by unreadable print a text of superimposed and blurred characters. In 
          effect <I>Veil</I> is a collection of visual poems. According to Perelman, 
          "its wordless pages, light gray with an overlay of letters, furnishes 
          a textbook illustration of [how] ... dissonances, fore-grounding their 
          own incompleteness [can be] considered in some sense normative." Bernstein 
          also published <I>Artifice of Absorption</I> and the collection of poems 
          <I>The Sophist</I> in 1987. The next year he brought out <I>Four Poems</I>, 
          a fine press edition of short poems on a single large sheet. He also 
          edited an issue of the journal <I>Boundary</I> 2 titled "43 Poets (1984)" 
          and a collection of statements about the line, "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Lines," 
          which was included in <I>The Line in Postmodern Poetry</I> (1988). </P>
      <P>The poems in <A name=_thesophist><I>The Sophist</I></A> have sparked 
      considerable critical interest. Literary critics such as Marjorie Perloff, 
      Jerome McGann, and John Shoptaw have hailed such poems as "Safe Methods of 
      Business," "The Simply," "The Years As Swatches," and "Amblyopia" as 
      important to contemporary poetry. <A name=dysraphism>"Dysraphism"</A> is a 
      poem from the collection that charts new poetic ground: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
        <P>Did a wind come just as you got up or were
        <P>you protecting me from it? I felt the abridgement
        <P>of imperatives, the wave of detours, the sabre-
        <P>rattling of inversion. <I>All lit up and no</I>
        <P><I>place to go</I>. Blinded by avenue and filled with
        <P>adjacency. Arch or arched at. So there becomes bottles,
        <P>hushed conductors, illustrated proclivities for puffed-
        <P>up benchmarks. Morose or comotose. "Life is what you find, existence 
        is what
        <P>you repudiate." A good example</P></BLOCKQUOTE>A major poem in his 
      oeuvre, "Dysraphism" brings together many of the approaches Bernstein made 
      in earlier work: his humor, the auditory density of his words, and the 
      dramatic compression of a multitude of voices into a continuous hiss or 
      apparent scrawl. The impermeability of texts such as "Shade" and the 
      accidentalism of "Lift Off" collide here. The qualities of typographic 
      compression and density are present despite the readability of the text. 
      Further, the accidental qualities of the voices and phrases seem 
      completely natural and effortless though the poem unwaveringly drives home 
      its powerful presence, establishing an argument and an enactment of 
      Bernstein's poetics. 
      <P></P>
      <P>In a footnote to this poem, Bernstein makes clear that he is using a 
      medical term to describe a method of constructing poems. <I>Raph</I> means 
      seam, Bernstein writes in a note to the poem, "so for me disraphism is 
      mis-seaming--a prosodic device." Perloff remarks in <I>The Dance of the 
      Intellect: Studies in the Poetry of the Pound Tradition</I> (1985) that 
      "<A name=dysraphism>'Dysraphism'</A> playfully exploits such rhetorical 
      figures as pun, anaphora, epiphora, metathesis, epigram, anagram, and 
      neologism to create a seamless web of reconstituted words" and that 
      "sensitivity to etymologies and latent meanings is reflected in the poem 
      itself, which is an elaborate 'dysfunctional fusion of embryonic parts' a 
      'disturbance of stress, pitch, and rhythm of speech' in the interest of a 
      new kind of urban 'rhapsody.'" The sound of "Dysraphism" almost achieves 
      the status of a rhapsody or a song while in it Bernstein achieves moments 
      of brilliant poetic speech. For example, "blinded by avenue and filled 
      with adjacency" demonstrates exactly how this "seaming" that Bernstein 
      proposes would work. The monolithic, ordered path ("avenue") is blinding; 
      that is the traditional form of poeisis. What intrigues the reader is the 
      idea of "adjacency," the materials at hand, next to us, next to each 
      other. These are the materials that will be dysraphically combined. Even 
      as Bernstein makes this assertion, his next words are "arch or arched at," 
      words that are "adjacent" because of their sound. </P>
      <P>Bernstein's <I>Artifice of Absorption </I>, published as a special 
      issue of <I>Paper Air</I> in 1987, is a further articulation of his 
      poetics. Called "the best introduction to Language poetry likely to be 
      written" by Shoptaw, this essay in poem format immediately foregrounds the 
      question of genre by its own form. In his introduction to <I>A Poetics</I> 
      (where an emended version of this text was later republished), Bernstein 
      comments, "If there's a temptation to read the long essay-in-verse ... as 
      prose, I hope there will be an equally strong temptation to read the 
      succeeding prose as if it were poetry." He makes a similar point later in 
      <I>Rough Trades</I>, "Nowadays, you can often spot a work / of poetry by 
      whether it's in lines / or no; if it's in prose, there's a good chance / 
      it's a poem." Shoptaw points out that genre-blurring occurs in Bernstein's 
      "versified narrative summaries" where he "blurs the lines between poetry, 
      fiction, and prose." </P>
        <P>In <A name=_artificeofabsorption><I>Artifice of Absorption </I></A>Bernstein 
          writes an essay that looks, on the page, like a poem. It is through 
          this positioning that this text is able to so clearly set the stage 
          for the description of the frame of Language poetry. The operative vocabulary 
          of this description consists of two main terms, "absorption" and "artifice." 
          A poem, Bernstein asserts, is writing "designed to absorb." Artifice 
          is "a measure of the poem's intractability to being read as the sum 
          of its devices and subject matter." Perelman notes that "even though 
          its line breaks foreground its artifice, the poem-essay contains much 
          conventional wiring. A large part of it is devoted to an omnibus review 
          of contemporary poetry, providing capsule summaries of a number of language 
          writers," including McCaffery, Susan Howe, Perelman, Nicole Brossard, 
          David Antin, and Lyn Hejinian. The essay is an excursion, concisely 
          stated, into poetry's terms, and gives, through references to other 
          crucial texts in the terrain, specific descriptions of the textual particulars 
          that constitute such writing specifically, what alternatives there are 
          to a view of the text as a "transparent carrier of 'meaning.'" Bernstein 
          writes that meaning, in such poetry, "is not absent or / deferred but 
          self-embodied as the poem / in a way that is not transferable to another 
          code / or rhetoric." Thus, the significance of this essay is that it 
          does not surrender the ground of the essay, but redefines it--and in 
          a way that is consistent with Bernstein's poetic achievements. </P>
      <P>"Most of [Bernstein's] poetry," McGann writes in <I>Black Riders</I>, 
      "does not surrender any of the territory of writing, any of the means to 
      meaning. As a consequence, his writing extends across an unusual semiotic 
      range--from the most minimal textual units, pre-morphemic, to the most 
      complex rhetorical and semantic structures; and it carries out this 
      'opening of the field' not as an exercise in, or display of, imaginative 
      mastery, but as an enactment--literally--of the world of writing." 
      Bernstein's achievement in <I>Artifice of Absorption</I> is that he goes 
      beyond simply mapping this new territory to claiming it through his own 
      parody of artifice. </P>
      <P>Bernstein had several appointments as a visiting professor during the 
      late 1980s at such schools as the University of California at San Diego, 
      the New School for Social Research, the State University of New York at 
      Buffalo, and at Princeton University. In 1989 Bernstein and Bee published 
      the lavishly illustrated <A name=_thenudeformalism><I>The Nude Formalism 
      </I></A>, a book of short parodic poems, described by McGann as "parodies 
      of the emblem tradition in [a] witty collaborative collection." Also 
      interested in musical theater, Bernstein worked with composer Ben 
      Yarmolinsky and wrote three librettos, <I>Blind Witness News, The 
      Subject</I> (1995), and <I>The Lenny Paschen Show</I>. Bernstein also 
      wrote <I>Cafe Buffe</I>, a libretto commissioned for composer Dean 
      Drummond's New Band. </P>
        <P>A milestone in Bernstein's career was his appointment in 1990 as the 
          David Gray Professor of Poetry and Letters at the State University of 
          New York at Buffalo, where he is also an associate member of the Department 
          of Comparative Literature. After his appointment, Bernstein cofounded 
          the Poetics Program, through which he has supported the New Coast and 
          other conferences as well as publications such as <I>Chain, Poetic Briefs</I>, 
          and <I>Situation</I> and resources such as Leave Books, Meow Press, 
          and the Electronic Poetry Center. He coordinates the "Wednesdays At 
          Four Plus," a reading series that has brought in important literary 
          figures to read and discuss their work, and also directs the Poetics 
          discussion list, an international online discussion group. Bernstein 
          received a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in 1990. </P>
      <P>Among Bernstein's publications in the early 1990s was <A 
      name=_roughtrades><I>Rough Trades</I></A>, a large collection that 
      presented poems in three sections: "The Riddle of the Fat Faced Man," 
      "Rough Trades," and "The Persistence of Persistence." Notable for its 
      display of Bernstein's sense of comedy, the collection opens with a clever 
      poem whose title evokes a tropical geography: <A 
      name=thekiwiwildlifebirdinthekiwitree>THE KIWI BIRD IN THE KIWI TREE</A> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

        <P>surround a baby's gurgling: encir-

        <P>beclouding the mind's acrobatic vers-
        <P>ions. The first fact is the social body,
        <P>one from another, nor needs no other.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>The reference to 
      the "downpour of words" suggests not only a tropical climate but also a 
      profusion of tropes and literary devices. Bernstein uses the poem to call 
      for heterogeneous writing, not the "paradise" of a rigidly hegemonic model 
      in which all is subordinated to a central image or insight. This 
      fourteen-line poem makes notable use of enjambment in its decasyllabic 
      lines. The hyphenated words <I>beyond, encircling</I>, and <I>versions</I> 
      add a stammering element to the sound of the poem but also relate to its 
      meaning: <I>be</I>- emphasizes being; <I>encir-cling</I> breaks the very 
      circle the word means to circumscribe while clinging to the attempt; and 
      <I>vers-ions</I> suggests both verse and <I>vers</I>, which means toward 
      or against in Latin. The sense of direction in "vers-" is reinforced by 
      the word's second half's being in a different direction, on the far left 
      of the next line. Thus, the word <I>version</I> itself becomes a 
      contortionist, dramatizing its own adjective, <I>acrobatic</I>. In this 
      poem and others Bernstein calls for writing described in "Reading the 
      Tree: 1," that is "turned into creamed figures, like constant / commotion, 
      [is] repeatedly connoting." 
      <P></P>
        <P>A significant theme of <I>Rough Trades </I>--one that recurs in Bernstein's 
          work--is suggested by its title. For Bernstein poetry not only is a 
          vocation but also a business--and in either sense, a rough one. This 
          theme is more than literary; it is true to Bernstein's generous and 
          tireless involvement with poetry. As McGann notes in <I>Black Riders</I>, 
          "The meaning of the work of poets like Lyn Hejinian and Bernstein is 
          partly a function of their involvement with the social and material 
          production of texts," and "like Morris and Pound, both have been actively 
          involved in every aspect of poetry's production--from writing to book 
          design to editing to distribution." While the difficulty of Bernstein's 
          poetry limits his audience, he believes in the poet's social role: "The 
          first fact is the social body, / one from another, nor needs no other." 
        </P>
      <P>Bernstein's "How I Painted Certain of My Pictures" was included in 
      <I>Best American Poetry, 1992</I>, but the more significant event of the 
      year was the publication of Bernstein's second book of essays, <A 
      name=_apoetics><I>A Poetics</I></A>. Significant essays, including "State 
      of the Art," "Play It Again, Pac-Man," "Optimism and Critical Excess 
      (Process)," "The Second War and Postmodern Memory" and the revised 
      "Artifice of Absorption," explore poetics, philosophy, and the social 
      dimensions of the text. Perelman comments, "Bernstein's continual 
      humor--certainly a pleasure in the critical landscape--and the finesse 
      with which he traverses institutional contexts (contemporary photography 
      and painting, TV news and ads, video games, poststructuralism) mask the 
      intransigence that ultimately informs the book where poetry is concerned." 
      </P>
      <P>Everywhere in his writing Bernstein's direction is toward the plural. 
      In "State of the Art" he asserts, "<I>Poetry is the aversion of conformity 
      </I>." "Occasionally," Perelman points out, "Bernstein envisions a 
      capacious unity, as in his call for 'a poetry and a poetics that do not 
      edit out so much as edit in....'" This is difficult ground, however. As 
      Perelman observes, "Such unities of poetry and poetics, modern and 
      postmodern--e pluribus unum--flip into their opposite. Instead of an 
      enlarged identity ... writing becomes the site of an intimate 
      demonstration of the impossibility of identity." </P>
      <P>An engaging piece in this collection is <A 
      name=hopeoptimismandcriticalexcessprocess>"Optimism and Critical Excess 
      (Process),"</A> the recast transcription of a talk given in Buffalo in 
      1988, which begins with the statement, "This is not a transcription." This 
      essay is particularly valuable because of Bernstein's consciousness of it 
      as a performance and his working through his main points with multiple 
      voices--the literary historian, the comic, the truly poetic in a manner 
      that crosses multiple disciplines. Poetics itself, in Bernstein's view, is 
      the site of a confluence of possibilities. It is exploratory and declines 
      reductive conclusions; it is "an activity that is ongoing, that moves in 
      different directions at the same time, and that tries to disrupt or 
      problematicize any formulation that seems too final or preemptively 
      restrictive." </P>
        <P>Furthering his efforts to give experimental poetry a platform, Bernstein 
          edited two works in 1993. He chose and edited recordings for the compact 
          disk <I>Live At the Ear</I>, which made available selections from the 
          reading series conducted from 1984 to 1993 at Ear Inn, a restaurant-bar 
          in lower Manhattan. The poets who can be heard include Bernstein as 
          well as Susan Howe, Ron Silliman, Bruce Andrews, and Rosmarie Waldrop. 
          Bernstein also worked with Howe to edit "13 North American Poets" for 
          <I>TXT</I> magazine in France. </P>
      <P>Bernstein's thirteen-poem collection <A name=_darkcity><I>Dark 
      City</I></A> shows his continuing mastery of multiple approaches to 
      experimental poetry. Its major poems include "The Lives of the Toll 
      Takers," "How I Painted Certain of My Pictures," "Emotions of Normal 
      People," "The Influence of Kinship Patterns upon Perception of an 
      Ambiguous Stimulus," and its title poem. According to Hank Lazer, <A 
      name=thelivesofthetolltakers>"The Lives of the Toll Takers,"</A> the first 
      poem in <I>Dark City</I>, "establishes a consideration of the state of 
      poetry today as one ... recurring concern for Bernstein." Lazer also 
      suggests that this poem contains "some seemingly simple and 
      straightforward axioms or conditions for poetry." Early on in the poem 
      Bernstein rejects an alliance with theories of empty signifiers:

          <P>In dreams begin a lot of bad
        <P>poetry.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P></P>
      <P>A diverse collection, <I>Dark City </I>, as Lazer explains, is "built 
      on a principle of difference--i.e., each poem different from those which 
      surround it and a book of poems which offers conscious resistance to 
      signature and the cults of personal voice [and] personality." Lazer points 
      to "Emotions of Normal People," a catalogue of seemingly found language in 
      the form of "an extended collage-poem," as one of the most important in 
      the collection and praises Bernstein's "compositional arsenal," which 
      includes "a wide-ranging vocabulary..., the recurrence of a peculiarly 
      clotted sound-effect, a kind of line and sound that is deliberately but 
      interestingly difficult to say, [and] a kind of anti-melliflousness." The 
      collection has the difficulty, rewards, and delight ("as difficult as / 
      Keeping a hat in a hurricane / Or an appointment with an erasure," 
      Bernstein writes in "The Influence of Kinship Patterns") that one would 
      expect from a major poet. </P>
      <P>Bernstein's work has commanded the attention of leading national 
      scholars and been widely read. Lazer reports that his writing has been 
      published in Argentina, China, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, France, 
      Switzerland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, England, Canada, 
      Mexico, Finland, Yugoslavia, and Japan. A correspondent for <I>Sulfur</I>, 
      Bernstein also serves on the editorial boards of <I>M/E/A/N/I/N/G </I>(New 
      York), the Segue Foundation (New York), and many other organizations. His 
      readership and reputation as a poet will probably rise when his next 
      collection, <I>Republics of Reality: Poems 1975-1995</I>, is published by 
      Sun &amp; Moon Press. It will include Bernstein's earlier, nearly 
      unobtainable books--<I>Parsing, Shade, Poetic Justice, Resistance, Stigma, 
      Senses of Responsibility, The Occurrence of Tune</I>, and <I>The Absent 
      Father in Dumbo</I> (1990)--and will feature a new sequence of poems 
      titled "Residual Rubbernecking." </P>
      <P>Bernstein has been called a "difficult" poet, but such a label surely 
      in part indicates his integrity as an artist. The body of Bernstein's 
      writing is evidence of his tireless investigation not only of but also 
      inside language. It is a record that cannot be collected in a single 
      volume because the disparate nature of each investigation must, of 
      necessity, modify the form it undertakes. As Bernstein remarks in his 
      essay "Optimism and Critical Excess (Process)," "We don't know what Art is 
      or does but we are forever finding out." McGann puts the case well in his 
      essay in <I>Contemporary Poetry Meets Modern Theory</I>: 
        <BLOCKQUOTE>For Bernstein, poetic "meaning" is never a product, and hence 
          cannot be coded or decoded. It is a process of writing through which 
          [in Shelley's words] "the before unapprehended relations of things" 
          have to be <I>attended to</I> (in both senses of that phrase). Among 
          the most important of those unapprehended relations are the ideological 
          formations--the constellated sets of different social opinions and understandings--which 
          define (sometimes even dominate) "the way we live now." The poet's office, 
          for Bernstein, is to put those constellations at the reader's disposal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
        "Like Shelley," McGann continues, 
      "Bernstein pursues this revelation not for its own sake, but to break the 
      spell of ideology by dislocating its forms of representation." 
      <P></P>
      <P>Much of the difficulty of Bernstein's work is part and parcel of his 
      aim as a writer. "The function" of such writing, according to Silliman, is 
      "to make the reader aware of the role of projection as a <I>response to 
      form</I> in the constitution of the reader as subject." McGann in <I>Black 
      Riders</I> also recognizes the centrality of the reader in this process: 
      "Poetry pursues its truth-functions by revealing agencies of meaning and 
      by implicating the reader in the processes of revelation." Being 
      implicated in this "process of revelation" places a demand on the reader. 
      In <I>Radical Artifice</I> Perloff suggests that a text is called 
      difficult because it does not meet the expectations of readers: "It is not 
      because meaning won't reveal itself to a receptive reader, but because the 
      culture has preconceptions of how images should be articulated and 
      connected. The stumbling block, that is to say, is not so much obscurity 
      as convention." </P>
      <P>Discussing the kinds of texts that have been called difficult in his 
      essay "In the Middle" from <I>A Poetics</I>, Bernstein suggests that one 
      must first differentiate between types of textual fragmentation: "To do 
      this, one has to be able to distinguish between, on the one hand, a 
      fragmentation that attempts to valorize the concept of a free-floating 
      signifier unbounded to social significance ... and, on the other, a 
      fragmentation that reflects a conception of meaning as prevented by 
      conventional narration and so uses disjunction as a method of tapping into 
      other possibilities available within language." In "Writing" from 
      <I>Content's Dream</I> he argues that the latter kind of text is not so 
      much difficult as incomplete, in the sense that it must be completed by 
      the reader: "In contrast to the predetermined interpretations of a text 
      based on the primacy of the self or of logic, it is the formal autonomy of 
      the text as model that elicits a response, an interpolation." The response 
      that such a text demands makes the text inclusive rather than exclusive, 
      since the reader's interpolation enters the fabric of the text. 
      Ultimately, such a text enters a new realm of truth because "its autonomy 
      is not of the self or logic but of nature, the world. Its truth is not 
      assumed but made." What Bernstein attempts to make with his reader is a 
      truth far greater than the tradition of author-centered texts could ever 
      achieve. Bernstein's work--beyond the issue of its so-called 
      difficulty--positions the text,its reader, and its meanings into a 
      constellation of activities that open new possibilities made real in 
      writing.</P>
