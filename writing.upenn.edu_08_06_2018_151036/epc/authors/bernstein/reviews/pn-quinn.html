       </big></big><big><big><br>
        </big></big></b></small><big><br>
        </big><big>Paul Quinn </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </big><big>A periodic and agonistic encounter
with Plato&nbsp; has marked the career of the philosophy-trained poet, Charles
Bernstein. His pivotal collection, <i>The Sophist</i> (1987), rubs Socrates
the wrong way,&nbsp; positing sophistry as a valid counter-hegemonic force. In Plato's Republic&nbsp; poetry
was to be stigmatized,
censored, or banished; in Bernstein's 'republics'&nbsp; poetic thinking is
critical in providing a model of autonomous, creative society. Like the sophist
who, to Socrates's chagrin, dangerously elides the categories of 'sophist,
statesman, philosopher', Bernstein has subsumed poetics and politics throughout
his work. He prefaces an important early essay, 'The Dollar Value of Poetry'
with an epigraph from Simone Weil's <i>Oppression&nbsp; and Liberty</i>:
'thought ... in so far as it is ceaselessly creating a scale&nbsp; of values
"that is not of this world" ... is the enemy of forces which control&nbsp;
society'. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>Bernstein seizes on this statement as an 'appeal  to another
world ... whose horizon is not totally a product of the coercive  delimiting
of the full range of language (the limits of language the limits  of experience)
by the predominating social forces'. Even at this early stage  of Bernstein's
writing career, we are presented with a crucial cluster of  philosophical
concepts and images that will figure throughout his work: the  utopic glimpse
of other worlds, the citation of Wittgenstein (a handy cognitive  map reference,
indeed, through the range of Bernstein's writing), and the  constant testing
of, and casting at, the horizon - a ubiquitous trope in later poems, where
it signifies variously a limit or a challenge, an unreachable  barrier or
a socially constructed geodesic dome, ripe for shattering. The  publication
by Sun and Moon Press of <i>Republics of Reality: 1975-1995</i>  enables
us to consider such continuities in Bernstein's work over a twenty year period,
even while experiencing the diversity of forms and methods that has expressed,
compressed, or repressed them. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>The stakes in Bernstein's poetics are certainly  high:
poems are republics founded in the reading process and enacted in the  open
agora constituted by a certain kind of writerly text; poems help propose
 other ways of relating, other forms of (self) government. His writing constantly
 configures and reconfigures the limiting agencies of borders, horizons,
rules.  In spite, or possibly because of, this considerable ambition, Bernstein
has  often been portrayed as a linguistic terrorist, or at best, a purveyor
of  gobbledegook; he has been positioned as American poetry's agent provocateur,
 its Jewish comedian, its Puck. For some, Bernstein and his comrades associated
 with the poetics journal, <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i>, represent an exhilarating 
fusion of critical theory and avant-garde poetics; a poetry as politicized 
and socially deconstructive as it is linguistically adventurous and exploratory. 
Other less enamoured American contemporaries have viewed this development 
angrily or askance, usually from within the safe-house of a university writing 
program, perceiving it as a jargon-laden, Theory-driven, and soul-denying 
anathema. Typically, Bernstein's own belated entrance into the academy - as
David Gray Professor of Poetics and Letters at SUNY-Buffalo - has been a
transforming one; drawing on the pioneering work of his distinguished predecessor 
and colleague still, Robert Creeley, Bernstein has striven to make this institution
 a poet's bolt-hole like no other: a place where practitioners teach poetics
 not poetry, the art rather than the craft. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>Bernstein's CV can be read almost as an exemplification
 of Derridean theory, to the extent that a deconstructive logic follows him
 (or always-already precedes him) wherever he goes: <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i>
 , which he co-edited with Bruce Andrews, with its Frankfurt-schooled, short-sharp
 theory-bites, changed the conventions of what a poetry journal should be,
 its impact lingering long after its short shelf life (19781982); the independent
 publishing ethos of Language poets, though in itself hardly a novelty in
the poetry world, helped create an impressively resilient and vigorously
alternative network of publication and distribution; the SUNY-Buffalo Poetics
Program is, as aforesaid, a rare place where poets are expected to engage
with the epistemological and theoretical implications of writing, rather
than, as in the American campus norm, serve time as colourful cap-and-belled
stock-characters in the University's rich tapestry. Traditionally, poets
in residence are not expected to worry their little heads with such matters,
are expected to leave all that to the heavyweights in the English faculty.
Bernstein describes a fellow poet of some standing talking about poets as
the 'guests of the university', or, shifting subservient analogies, as 'going
into mines, bringing out the ore that the critics then take away'. Bernstein
does not subscribe to this division of labour. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>He has also eagerly subverted the conventional  contexts
and genres of literary production. The prose collections <i>Content's  Dream</i>
 (1986), <i>A Poetics</i> (1987), and <i>My Way</i> (1999) similarly attempt
to subvert the genre they engage with - in this case the critical essay.
Though often brilliant pieces of expository writing, live with critical energy,
they cannot resist formal excursions into verse (the most thoroughgoing insight
into his methodology that Bernstein has produced, 'Artifice of Absorption', 
is a verse-essay), self-consuming artifice, or jokes. The seductive efficacy
 of the latter should not be underestimated, for even many of his detractors
 would admit that Bernstein's essays are full of wit and brio. Indeed, they
 are almost counter-productively so, to the extent that the comparative accessibility
 of his essay collections (the two most recent published by large university
 presses) means that the poetry itself is in danger of being overlooked or
 overshadowed. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><i>Republics of Reality: 1975-1995 </i>is the best opportunity
yet to gauge the poet's designedly disruptive contribution to poetic practice
in the period preceding, including, and following L=A=N=G=U=A=G= E magazine
and its attention-garnering flurry of manifestos. The dust has now settled
somewhat, and many of the poets associated with Language have been assimilated
or forgotten, excoriated or championed by the adherents of 'official verse
culture'. This latter phrase is one of Bernstein's most controversial and
wilfully wave-making formulations, first brandished in the early essay 'The
Academy in Peril: William Carlos Williams Meets the MLA'; an essay which
is the literary critical equivalent of the last stand of Peckinpah's The
Wild Bunch there is a gatling-gun inclusivity in its targetting, you may
have doubts about its unrelenting clamour, but you can't deny the bravery,
the anti-pragmatic disdain for diplomatic escape routes. Here then, is a
chance to consider twenty years of poetry by Language's most visible and
vocal spokesman. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>It is undoubtedly the case that much of the actual poetry
produced by those who have been associated with Language has been obscured
by the discourse swirling around it: both the discourse generated  to support
it (the poetics, the polemics) and the discourse directed against  it. A
representative example of the latter was the ruffled response of Glyn  Maxwell
in the <i>TLS </i>in 1993, when he bemoaned the stubborn determination of
Language poets to publish 'long after the magazine that gave them their name
has disappeared along with the likelihood of anyone else taking an interest'.
 If this is the case then these decapitated chickens have shown remarkable
 stamina, clocking up countless laps even after Maxwell's lament. David Bromwich,
 too lofty to stoop to exasperation, offered the Olympus-eye-view instead,
 'They do not appear, as yet, to write good poems'. Things have been more
rancorous in the United States, where at the very least the Language poets
were seen as puncturing the idea that everyone in the poetry world was part
of the same happy cheese and wine party, all equal in the eyes of the grant
committee, and at the most were seen as Trotskyite entryists despoiling poetry's
hitherto disinterested glades. Things have now moved on somewhat; Bernstein
and other Language poets have been embraced by university presses, are widely
taught, and are beginning to make inroads into the crucial anthologies. If
anything the charge has shifted to accusations of selling out - 'The Long
March to Tenure' in the caustic phrase of movement pioneer Ron Silliman.
      </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><i>Republics of Reality</i> thus appears at a transitional
moment in the reception of this particular avant garde. It brings together
eight earlier collections and chapbooks now out of print or hard to find.
A ninth segment, 'Residual Rubbernecking', collects recent short poems. It
is important to remember that <i>Republics of Reality</i>  is not a Collected
Poems as such; many of the most significant Bernstein volumes of this period
- <i>Controlling Interests</i> (1980), <i>Islets/Irritations</i>  (1983),
T<i>he Sophist</i>, and <i>Dark City</i> (1994), for example - are not included
in whole or part, because of their easier availability. Nevertheless, the
continuities and innovations of perspective and practice evident in those 
more well-known books are also readily traceable here within the covers of 
one volume. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>The very first poem included, 'Sentences', from      
 <i>Parsing</i> (1976), plays punningly on its title to imply the ways the
Self is clenched by clich&eacute;, trapped in the prison-house of the proverbial.
It is possible over the course of Bernstein's work, even as it is excerpted
in <i>Republics of Reality</i>, to discern negative and positive poles to
the poetry (though one should bear in mind the claim of one of Bernstein's 
inspirations, Theodor Adorno, that 'consumate negativity, once squarely faced, 
delineates the mirror-image of its opposite'). Thus, many of the early poems 
in particular describe a world in which we are the oppressed subjects of ideology
(such poems thematize oligarchies with fake-democratic Smiley masks rather
than republics), and explore the procedures by which language is used coercively,
the ways it shapes and socializes. Against this, is the poetry's saving emphasis
on the materiality of language (the 'actual word stuff' to borrow a phrase
of another of Bernstein's crucial models, Louis Zukofsky), which helps divert
the hierarchical relays enshrined in what the poet calls 'The conduit theory
of communication' - whereby Power perpetuates itself with transparent ease.
Ranged against this are syntactical and linguistic experiments designed to
elude official templates. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>'Sentences', however, like a number of the more  melancholy
early satiric poems, is ultimately less concerned to suggest escape  routes
than to transcribe the trap: the lifesentences to which many are condemned
 and contorted, the ready-to-wear phrases to which we cut our cloth in turn.
 The poem's sentences seem to mix standard middle class ennui, with non-standard
 underclass alienation ('they want you to clean / They dont have no feeling
 / They want to know - what should I call you? '). One of Bernstein's achievements
 in poems like this is, by a process of accumulation, selection, careful
collage,  paradoxically to suggest a subject, or a number of subjects, coming
to awareness  of their own subjection, yet unable to express this in anything
other than  the language that enchains them: 'I had to become what everyone
wanted me  to be.' </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>This latter phrase links a number of key poems  produced
throughout Bernstein's career which incorporate (and parody) the  official
languages of selfhood's construction. In his insider's literary history of
the Language poets, <i>The Marginalization of Poetry</i>, Bob Perelman  suggests
that for a number of these poets 'breaking the automatism of the  poetic
- I - and its naturalized voice', was the first heave. In Bernstein,  the
'I' gets fractured into school-reports, psychiatric case-histories, peer-reviews.
 To some extent the emphasis on coercion of such poems returns us to the
etymological  roots of the word 'character', a word used both for a letter
and for a personality,  which is derived from a Greek word for a branding
iron, which in turn is related to a word for a pointed stake. Perhaps the
most notorious of these social characterizations can be seen in 'Standing
Target', from <i>Controlling Interests</i> , which includes in its found
materials actual reports from Bernstein's childhood Summer Camp: 'Charlie/is
not strong in manual dexterity. (This/may be part of a mixed dominance/situation
Mrs. B. And I discussed in/relation to tying shoes.).' But there are plenty
of comparable moments in <i>Republics of Reality</i> , not least in the prose
poem 'Palukaville', where a cacophony of voices, some of which may belong
to Charles Bernstein are heard, but all of which share the bad faith inherent
in the daily masquerade: </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
       </big><big>       </big><small>       </small>
      <blockquote><big> My elementary school teachers thought I was vague, 
unsocial, &amp; lacked the ability to coordinate the small muscles in my hands.
The way it feels. The mistake is to think you can put on the mask at work
and then take it off when you get home. I enjoy it. If I acted like a manager
to please my managers it would be irrelevant what I thought 'privately'. The
one-two punch: behaviorism and meritocracy. I couldn't spell at school and
still can't </big><small><br>
        </small><small>         </small><big>       </big><small><br>
        </small><small>         </small>       </blockquote>
        <small>         </small><big><br>
        </big><big> The parataxical method of procedure, the deployment  of
the individual sentence rather than the line as the principal unit of the 
poem, the way the sentences sometimes tenuously sometimes tantalizingly connect, 
or at other times are free-standing, forcing the reader to make their own 
connections, makes this seem an instance of 'The New Sentence' as influentially 
defined by Bernstein's friend and sometime collaborator Ron Silliman. Certainly 
this dystopian strain in Bernstein's work tends to produce poems like this, 
which depict our ideological positioning in the world, and the part that received,
normative and official languages play in the process. In <i>A Poetics</i>
  Bernstein further describes such strategies as constituting another delimited 
horizon, attacking 'the policing, the colonizing, the standardizing, and those
structures, styles, tropes, methods of transition that connote or mime or
project (rather than confront or expose or redress) these approaches to the
world'. The early work represented in <i>Republics of Reality</i> is, then,
very much from a period when much Language poetry was as preoccupied with
describing Althusserian interpellation as prescribing utopian alternatives. 
Nevertheless, even at this early phase, there are still glimmers of resistance 
(the title of a transitional collection, included in <i>Republics of Reality</i>
 ), of the urge to 'confront or expose or redress', and of a non-alienated
 awareness. There is a focus on the material act of writing, for example,
on the actual physical body that writes and is more than a mere receptacle
for top-down propaganda. Thus, in the most Sillimanesque sentence of all,
'An erotic pleasure pressing against the pen with my thumb, sore under the
nail from a splinter.' </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </big><big>Furthermore, there is a sense of other
ways of being, other ways of using words: 'I'm trapped by the job only insofar
as I transpose my language to fit it.' To use language in ways that do not
succumb to the traps and snares of command or convention, to the job-description
or the inherited form, is central to the politics and poetry of much Language
writing. The William Carlos Williams whom Bernstein has tried to wrest back
from the clutches of official verse culture avows in his <i>The Embodiment
of Knowledge</i> that 'it is to divorce words from the enslavement of the
prevalent clich&eacute;s that all the violent torsions (Stein, Joyce) have
occured ' In <i>Language</i> poetry such torsions are on behalf of, and in
collaboration with, readers - those fellow fugitives from the chain-gang;
the goal is a collective activity more thoroughgoing and even more integral,
more explicit and dynamic, than the necessary reciprocation poets always
seek. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>Crucially, the poems attempt to produce 'exemplary'  (Bernstein,
at his most didactic and palpably designing in 'The Dollar Value  of Poetry',
uses this word when calling for poems that are 'an instance broken  off from
and hence not in the service of this cultural-social-force called  capitalism
- a chip of uninfected substance') perceptual republics where the reconstituted
'reality' is created by the community of readers, and realised  in readings
not bound by habituated thought or forms. The sheer otherness  of the other
worlds such poetry inspires us to imagine is brought home most  vividly in
their syntactical transgression, and in a clamorous oddity particularly  evident
in many of Bernstein's utopian later poems, which seem to hover at  the horizon
between sound and sense, a bee-loud glade of sonic excess, and  where his
indebtedness to Hopkins, Swinburne and Bunting is as evident as  the more
obvious antecedents of the Objectivists and the New York School.  When I
recently interviewed Bernstein, he attributed his love of reading poets like
Hopkins and Swinburne (poets who possess and require what he terms a 'double
hearing') to the way in which in their poems the sound, the heavily  accented
patternings of vowels and consonants, the thickened dictions, often  overpowers
or delays sense, in the same way a Turner seascape is washed in  waves of
paint that threaten to drown the figuration in the almost-abstract.     
  </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>To achieve his own comparable effects, Bernstein  has
moved increasingly from the concrete blocks of collaged discourse prevalent
 in the early poems to short, overdetermined lyrics that clang with exaggerated
 assonance and half-rhyme. The most pronounced of these are poems in a self-invented
 mode he has dubbed, 'The Nude Formalism', a carnivalesque parody of the
sonorous  austerities of The New Formalism. 'Pinky Swear' is a typical sonnet
of this  type : </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>Such mortal slurp to strain this sprawl went  droopy </big><big><br>
        </big><big>Gadzooks it seems would bend these slopes in  girth </big><big><br>
        </big><big>None trailing failed to hear the ship looks loopey   
   </big><big><br>
        </big><big>Who's seen it nailed uptight right at its berth...   
    </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big> And so the poem proceeds on its awkward way;  many of
the other poems represented here possess 'the beauty in a lack of  grace'
that Bernstein has described elsewhere, apparently seeking a poetry  that
can dance with two left feet. Not for nothing is he a poet who can wax  lyrical
about the kinetic clumsiness of Jerry Lewis, or cite Antonio Carlos  Jobim's
'Desafinado' as a clarion call: 'You insist my music goes against  the rules
/ But rules were never meant for lovesick fools / I wrote this little song
for you but you don't care / Its a crooked song oh but all my love is there.'
The 'slightly out of tune' tonality is sounded throughout these later poems.
But for all the distracting noisiness, sense is not jettisoned, instead it
is intimately bound up with what is striving to be said in this strange off-key
music, the improvised anthems of these new republics. And buried it may be,
but imagery is discernable too - there is a Turneresque drowning boat at
the heart of 'Pinky Swear'. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>The title is also significant, a throwaway promise  to
a child (and thus of the utmost importance) sanctified by conjoined pinky
 fingers: 'do you pinky swear that you will do it'? Bernstein has retreated
 (or advanced?) deeper into the nursery as his career has developed; riddles,
 nursery rhymes, nonsense verse have all been eagerly embraced. If the early
 poems saw the child as the sitting target for socialization, the latter
see  the child as the site of resistance, a potential space where words can
be  played with like sand in sand-pits, a stage when the world is still malleable.
 Children, or the childlike, are the potential citizens of Bernstein's republics.
 Which is not to say that Bernstein has turned away from complexity or disjunction;
 on the contrary the nursery rhymes and nonsense verse are seen as a kind
of ur- inherited form, which the poet adapts and deforms by overloading the
poem with a vast array of technical languages, philosophical propositions,
literary references till it, as in the poem 'Shell', 'scrapes/buckles, walls'
or in 'Verdi and Postmodernism', it 'spills &amp; sprawls &amp; booms'. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>This utopian straining in Bernstein then, necessitates
 strange and fascinating forms. His longer collages have become ever more
elaborate in their variety of found materials; the comedy has become more
integral than ever - both directly, in vaudevillean jokes and puns, and indirectly,
 in a comedy of different scales and registers mixed and matched. <i>The
Sophist          </i>(probably still the best indicator of his range) begins
with 'The Simply', which, for the critic Jerome McGann is a model poem, where 
the subject is 'the enactment rather than the representation of meaning'. 
Which is to say it is another 'exemplary' space where the reader is made constantly
aware of the methodologies and mindsets from which meaning is made. Hence
the bizarre parade of incorporated discourses - philosophical meditations,
poetics, archaic dictions, etymological sleights, and pop cultural references.
By contrast, the last poem in that volume, 'The Harbour of Illusion', is
a much more constrained and restrained piece, which reads like the husk of
a lyric poem, within which ruined space the beautiful, the elegaic, the sonorous
- all the sighing ghosts of traditional lyricism - pass through fleetingly.
Through, in the poem's own figuration, a 'thoroughfare / of noon's atoll'.
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>This lyricism becomes increasingly evident in        
 <i>Republics of Reality</i>, and it is not always the parodic, off-key version
of lyricism either. Short lyrics like 'Buffalo Nights' and 'Mall at Night'
effortlessly achieve the kind of non sequitur beauty beloved of Ashbery,
but do so in a clotted, compacted manner all their own. Often there is a
conscious sense of rug-pulling, such as in 'Hard Copy', where a lyric register
is carefully wrought: </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big> To be tutored by the rain &amp; still care for darkness
- </big><big><br>
        </big><big>not restraint, exactly, where the fall of the  window
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>Prefigures an older tale of teeming advertence  - </big><big><br>
        </big><big>The lock on the meadow or frame around the bee.      
 </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big> The sonnet proceeds on its stately way until  gleefully
announcing a Miltonic pratfall: 'Stand / on guard, let others take  the fall
- she also serves / who wades.' Ever the vaudevillean, Bernstein  cannot
resist providing even his most lush constructions with their own banana  skins.
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </big><big>This particular sense of 'exploded lyric',
in Bernstein's phrase, is none the less a revision of traditional poetic
values of a kind that Language poets would have been less likely to admit
to in the first flush of iconoclasm. Increasingly too, there is a sense of
heightened language which ( to borrow a perceptive image of the poet and critic
Geoffrey O'Brien) seems 'to hover near meaning in a state of frustrated desire'.
The principle effect then, is of a clamorous sound-world which operates aslant
meaning, on the brink of semantics, never quite connecting. This, however,
is an intensification rather than a revolution in Bernstein's work. Indeed,
the roots of this particular trope can be traced back to comparatively early
poems like the aforementioned 'Palukaville', whose title alludes to the living
hell invoked in <i>On the Waterfront</i>, the one to which losers like Terry
Malloy are given one-way tickets. Even in the barren terrain of this generally
bleak prose poem, Bernstein stakes out a pioneering republic of reality where
' ... love of language - the hum - the human - excludes its reduction to
a scientifically managed system of reference in which all is expediency and
truth is nowhere'. Elsewhere, in 'The Taste Is What Counts', Bernstein is
again restlessly prowling the perimeters of his material, language: 'The
boundaries perceivable in a form attended on both sides by a border within
which limitlessness lives, hung as press of confusion. I in boundary, the
very hum of it'. Compare this, from the book length poem, <i>The Occurrence
 of Tune</i>: 'desire projected &amp; recast, to unmake the borders of logic'.
 In many such poems from different periods a thematic and tropical obsession
 recurs: language as desire humming at the borders of meaning. At their most
 utopian these poems extend Wittgenstein by seeking limitlessness in language,
 they seem intent on proving that the horizon is merely a t<i>rompe l'oeil 
        </i>stage set &agrave; la Peter Weir's <i>The Truman Show</i>. </big><big><br>
        </big><big><br>
        </big><big>To return briefly to 'The Dollar Value of Poetry',  Bernstein
claims in that essay that the value released in the reading of a poem that
is not 'commoditized', is not 'dollar value' (transferable, instrumental)
 but, instead, 'that nongeneralized residue that is specific to each particular
 experience'. The very singularity of the reading experience that such poems
 offer, therefore, provides resistance to 'any form of normative standardization
 in the ordering of words in a unit or the sequencing of these units, since
 determining the exact nature of these is what makes for the singularity
of  the text'. Bernstein's epigrammatic coup-de-grace is to declare that
'Caesar  himself is the patron of our grammar books'. Against this roman
road of authoritarian  thought, Wittgenstein is once again invoked as an
ally, one who worried that  'the world can easily be reduced to only the
straight rows of the avenues  of the industrial district, with no place for
the crooked winding streets  of the old city.' But even this old city can
help us conjecture a new republic  : 'To imagine a language is to imagine
a form of life' - think of that first  imagine as the active word here. This
substantial collection may help change  the view of many who see only aimless
iconoclasm and irresponsible deconstruction  in the legacy of Language poetry;
for here, Bernstein implies, are building  blocks for a new republic, just
an horizon away. </big><big><br>
