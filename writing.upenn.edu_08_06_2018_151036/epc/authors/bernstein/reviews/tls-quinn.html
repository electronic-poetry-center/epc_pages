<p>&nbsp;The surprising survival of Language poetry and poetics
<p>&nbsp;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E equals what? The fact that a plethora of publications
are still asking that question, twenty-one years since the poetics journal
with the infamously equalizing masthead (signifying both the political
goal of equality that galvanized most of its poets, and the close scutiny
of the sign itself, that marked them all) was first published, sixteen
years since it ceased publication, and almost thirty years since the constellation
of poets originally associated with Language poetry began to meet and circulate
their work, is testament to the impact, abiding interest, and the still
potent challenge thrown down to traditional literary procedure by Language
poetry. In the words of one of its most significant poets, Ron Silliman,
"no other current poetic tendency in America has been subject to the constant
flow of dismissals and exposes, many of them composed in the threatened
rhetoric of fury".
<p>&nbsp;Language poetry arrived on the American scene in part as a critical
reaction to the narrow, speech-based poetics then prevalent. The experimental
poet Robert Grenier's provocative statement "I HATE SPEECH", published
in the proto-Language-journal This in 1971, is seen by some as an inaugural
moment, ushering in a new era of Writing writ large, where the signifier
was foregrounded; where, borrowing a phrase of one of their elected forefathers,
Louis Zukofsky, the "actual word stuff" was paramount. One of the things
that made the Language poets so interesting and unusual, was that despite
their outsider status, their determined distance from the Academy (the
editors of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews, were at
the time of its initial publication, respectively, a freelance writer of
medical abstracts and a political economist), and from its conservative
writing programmes, they shared an easy familiarity with the Continental
theory and philosophy about to sweep through the literature programmes,
if not the creative-writing departments, of America. Where their Poundian
and Olsonian antecedents had looked to Chinese or Mayan cultures for working
models to make modernity's fragments cohere, the Language poets drew on
the likes of Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Adorno, Althusser and, more problematically,
but still productively, Derrida, Barthes and Lacan, to think through the
fragmentation; it was as if the Beats had been schooled at Frankfurt, rather
than Columbia.
<p>&nbsp;The Language poets, then, were and are a group of writers more
than prepared to hoist a flag proclaiming Here Be Theory over a literary
terrain hitherto either oblivious to or sealed off from it. Opponents of
Marxist aesthetics and post-structuralist thought could no longer say such
work was hopelessly aether-bound and ipso facto redundant for literary
practice; whatever they thought of the results, here was a poetry palpably
grappling with it. Poets within the movement, however (and "movement" itself
should be placed carefully within quotation marks), have always been keen
to stress that the poems should not be seen as secondary, or merely elaborate
illustrations of abstruse Continental theories. Language poets have most
often drawn their inspiration from earlier poetic experiments, arguing
in their critical writing that this precursor poetry often goes far beyond
the meditations on language of much theory. Thus, Gertrude Stein has been
read as attentively as Wittgenstein; Zukovsky's great poem including history
and (Marxist) economics, "A", is as much a favoured resource as Adorno's
Negative Dialectics; other antecedents include poets as diverse as William
Carlos Williams, Larry Eigner, Jackson Mac Low and the John Ashbery of
The Tennis Court Oath, that extraordinary poetic toolbox and toybox; the
constructivist Ashbery, that is, rather than the post-Pulitzer, late-Romantic
Ashbery, promoted by Harold Bloom into an eternal agonistic contest with
Wallace Stevens.
<p>&nbsp;From this conflux of influences has emerged a remarkable range
of poetry too little known in Britain: Susan Howe's skilled use of textual
and literary history to produce poems that read like a haunting and haunted
combination of variorum edition and palimpsest; Bruce Andrews's rebarbative
lyrics that fizz with the slang, the obscenities and the ecstasies of modern
communication; Ron Silliman's ongoing long poem The Alphabet, which mingles
quotidian observation, linguistic-philosophical reflection and street-level
social critique to produce as vivid, systemic and cumulatively moving an
account of contemporary life as any poet now writing.
<p>&nbsp;This latest batch of studies testify to a transitional moment
in the movement's history. The outsiders have to some extent come inside:
Charles Bernstein is a now a distinguished professor, albeit at an institution
capacious enough to have once housed Charles Olson's maverick spirit, the
State University of New York at Buffalo; reciprocally, there have been
steadily increasing signs of rapprochement from the academy, pioneered
by long-time advocates such as Marjorie Perloff, who in a number of critical
works has been keen to place the Language poets in a post-Poundian tradition
of experiment, and Jerome McGann, for whom they represent an inspirational
and exemplary fusion of politics and poetics. Language poets like Silliman,
who intransigently remain outside the academy's co-opting gates, have been
somewhat barbed in their attitude to those like Bob Perelman, who have
moved within. Language poetry is concerned, then, with what it is to be
radical in theory, practice and institutionally: should an avant-garde
adopt and adapt existing institutions, or must it remain resolutely within
its own alternative networks? Certainly, with its impressive range of small
presses, journals, web-sites and dedicated distributors, Language poetry
has hitherto fought hard to avoid both dependence on academic patronage
and the lurking threat of the market's maw.
<p>&nbsp;The title of Charles Bernstein's collection of essays, My Way,
is characteristically ironic; only in the most alternative of universes
could Bernstein be imagined as Old Blue Eyes, leader of his own literary
Rat Pack. More seriously, virtually every sentence in the book demonstrates
that there can only be ways - provisional and plural. Moreover, the book's
caustic and cautionary comments on identity politics - the dominant preoccupation
in American literary practice and theory alike - suggests the "My" is equally
problematic. As ever, Bernstein puts into practice what he preaches; far
from being conventional expository prose, the volume is a bricolage of
poems in essay form, essays in verse, interviews, polemics, provocations
("There's more innovation and more cultural acumen in any episode of Ren
and Stimpy than in any of the books of our last trio of (American) poet
laureates"), puns and jokes. This seems appropriate for a poet who, in
an earlier essay on comedy, boasts of working under the influence of the
three Marxes - Chico, Groucho and Karl - and the four Williamses - Raymond,
William Carlos, Tennessee and Esther. There is even (a somewhat revisionist
gesture for so pointedly impersonal a poet) an autobiographical interview,
which is, nevertheless, a good introduction to the poet and his preoccupations.
<p>&nbsp;Trained in philosophy under Stanley Cavell at Harvard, Bernstein
has long argued for "poetry as epistemological inquiry". As befits a writer
whose pivotal collection of poems is called The Sophist (1987), he is joyfully
contrarian and ever ready to reveal the rhetoric in both his own writing
and the world's prevailing narratives: "Verse is born free but everywhere
in chains. It has been my project to rattle the chains."
<p>&nbsp;The project in My Way is not "to break down generic distinctions
as much as to bring genres and styles into rhetorical play with one another".
The key institutional corollary of this is a desire to alter the discursive
practices of academic writing, to challenge the "tone lock" that limits
thought to MLA guidelines. Bernstein's brief, then, is to extend poetic
thinking to pedagogy, aware, as he is, that "You can't fully critique the
dominant culture if you are confined to the forms through which it reproduces
itself". This is demonstrated in various instances through the book, not
least in the charged arena of identity politics, where, through the agency
of the workshop poem, diverse ethnic material and experience is refamiliarized
into the cultural norm. In an earlier book, A Poetics, Bernstein satirized
such workshop formulas that can easily replace "I see grandpa on the hill
/ next to the memories I can never recapture" with "I see my yiddishe mamma
on hester street / next to all the pushcarts I can no longer peddle", and
so on, inserting your ethnic variant at will.
<p>Bernstein's own poetry practice has been tireless in striving to find
a language fit to reflect and affect the times. If his essays are an ambitious
and exciting attempt at a formally various methodology, his poems are collages
of extraordinary range and texture; no American poet since Ashbery has
woven such multifarious material into his poems. This is allied to a full-blown
and mordantly funny critique of the roles we are made to adopt, of socialization's
masquerade. In a poem like "Standing Target" from Controlling Interests
(1980), the poet includes his own reports from summer camp ("Charlie has
grown to enjoy our organised games / His interest carries throughout the
/ period, as a rule . . ."); similarly in "Asylum", from Islets/Irritations
(1983), the language of definition with all its damaging shorthand is again
to the fore, but proceeding in syntactically severed sentences, so that
each line plunges us in medias res, encouraging the reader to construct
a fuller sense, rather than take the word of authority on trust.
<p>&nbsp;The much-anthologized "The Klupzy Girl", from the same collection,
with its beguiling opening lines ("Poetry is like a swoon, with this difference:
/ it brings you to your senses"), is another compelling combination of
found texts, exaggerated euphony (unlike some of his contemporaries, Bernstein
veers often from "ordinary" speech, finding echoes in those poets he claims
possess a "double hearing", in the soundplay of Ossian, Swinburne, Hopkins),
and the palpably designing: To stroll on the beach is to be in the company
of the wage-earner and the unemployed on the public way, but to command
a view of it from a vantage both recessed and elevated is to enter the
bourgeois space; here vantage and view become consumable.
<p>&nbsp;This poem, then, rejects the view from the honeymoon suite on
to "Dover Beach", an ear cocked for the "long, withdrawing roar", just
as it rejects the distanced and raised Romantic position of "Lines Composed
A Few Miles above Tintern Abbey"; it insists instead on the thick of things,
on the web of words one cannot remove oneself from and contemplate in tranquillity.
Much purportedly modern poetry in fact cleaves to Romantic and pastoral
models; Bernstein calls instead for a poetry "that engages the social world
directly, by taking on its jargon and its technologies, its blather and
its displacements, not only as subjects but as methods of organisation,
as environments, to be sounded and tested and thought through by and in
the poem".
<p>Bernstein's latest book of poetry, Log Rhythms, a serial poem made in
collaboration with his wife, the artist Susan Bee, contains a segment that
uses the Manhattan Yellow Pages as a resource, both to suggest the modern
world's infinite variety and to track our circumscription by designation
("Bob's Construction / Bob's Diner / Bob's Hardware / Bob's Train and Hobby
Center"); elsewhere in the poem's echo chamber, it is as if we are experiencing
bourgeois culture's thousand twangling instruments, humming about our ears:
advertising jargon, skewed commonplaces, nonsense verse and mock nursery
rhymes abound. Nursery rhymes have a special significance in Bernstein's
verse: they offer both a reminder that ideology coos at us over the crib
and a potential liberation from conventional sense, a dawning awareness
that the world is still to be made.
<p>&nbsp;Marjorie Perloff has been one of the most trusted chaperones for
Language poetry inside the academy. She is, moreover, one of the best close
readers of innovative poetry. Her absorbing new collection of occasional
essays, Poetry On and Off the Page, extends preoccupations articulated
in previous works - for example, with poetry in an era of technological
transformation, with the way figures from other disciplines, like John
Cage, have charted the possibilities of a post-linear poetry through a
kind of linguistic unconscious, and with the impact of Wittgenstein - particularly
his claim that "the limits of my language are the limits of my world" and
its implications for poetry. Among the Language poets writing under the
sign of Wittgenstein that Perloff scrutinizes are Steve McCaffery, who
in his Evoba writes "If the aim of philosophy is, as / Wittgenstein claims,
to show the fly the / way out of the fly-bottle,then the aim of / poetry
is to convince the bottle that / there is no fly". Perloff's deft exegesis
emphasizes that in poetry, there is only the bottle itself, no extractable
fly, no inside or outside language. Another chapter is devoted to Lyn Hejinian,
whose Oxota: A short Russian novel exemplifies a poetry based on the rhetorical
figure of parataxis - units placed together without connectives or subordination,
thus requiring the reader's participation in the sense-making process.
It is a mode Hejinian has previously adopted in her classic My Life, an
ongoing poetic autobiography with a chapter and sentence for each year
of the poet's life. This self-imposed formalism, and the variety of materials
and positions with which she constructs her sentences, enables Hejinian
to resist the atomization of conventional autobiography.
<p>&nbsp;In Artifice and Indeterminacy: An anthology of new poetics, Christopher
Beach usefully brings together a number of influential essays and excerpts
from larger studies by Language poets, and by a growing number of university-based
critics and scholars interested in Language-oriented work. The subtitle
alludes cunningly to Donald Allen's highly influential 1960 outsider anthology,
The New Poetry, while the shift from poetry to poetics is a telling sign
of the times. Bob Perelman's essay addresses the impact of Ron Silliman's
conception of "The New Sentence" - a way of making the sentence, rather
than the free-verse line, the basic unit of the poem - as a procedural
method, and its adaptation by various poets including Hejinian. Each New
Sentence gains its disorienting effects by being placed next to another,
to which it has, apparently, only tangential relevance. Some, such as the
Marxist critic Fredric Jameson, have seized on such techniques to portray
Language poetry as but a symptom of the radical disconnection of the times,
but Perelman persuasively argues that Silliman and Hejinian fight the random
parataxis of the channel-hop or supermarket visit with a more oppositional
version, where readers create community through precise and creative acts
of reading. In Silliman's words: "The point at which you read each word
(the / only point there is), two minds share a larger whole."
<p>&nbsp;In another essay in the collection, Barrett Watten seizes on one
of Silliman's decidedly unheroic particulars, an apparently banal sentence
from the long poem Tjanting: "Small white plastic fork whose handle ends
in the figure of 'golden' arches." For Watten, this sentence is more than
a piece of social realism, it comments on larger social forms: monopoly
capitalism will create many such forks, but there can be only one in the
poem, transformed through attention. This seems to bear out Perloff's claims
that, however difficult or rarefied these poets are accused of being, they
are also intensely in and of the world. In Poetry On and Off the Page,
she takes Jameson to task for the "synecdochic fallacy" by which he is
able to locate high modernism in Van Gogh's "A Pair of Boots", with its
"violent transformation of a drab peasant object world" and postmodernism
in Andy Warhol's "Diamond Dust Shoes", "debased and contaminated in advance
by their assimilation to glossy advertising images". For Perloff, Jameson
is simplifying both periods and artists; but it is also possible to see
drab objects in Silliman's poetry - like the McDonald's logoed fork - as
hovering tantalizingly between these terms: a space where contemporary
poetry might operate critically.
<p>&nbsp;In a typically combative essay on literary journalism's mistreatment
of innovative poetries, Perloff includes among her exhibits a review in
the TLS in 1993 by Glyn Maxwell of a range of books of poetry criticism
(including some Language-oriented titles), in which the exasperated reviewer
bemoans the fact that these poets continue to write about each other "long
after the magazine that gave them their name has disappeared along with
the likelihood of anyone else taking an interest". One wonders when exactly
was the literary moment when (to borrow one of Charles Bernstein's splendidly
chippy catchphrases) "official verse culture" actually did take an interest;
but the objects of such neglect thrive regardless. Works as stimulating,
calculatedly cantankerous, and irrepressibly entertaining as My Way, and
readings as acute and suggestive as those offered in Poetry On and Off
the Page, suggest it will be worth following Language poetry and poetics
for some time yet.
