      <H3><!--_a-head-->1. Language is the Stuff of the World 
      <!--_/a-head--></H3>
      <P>Of course nothing could be more paradoxical than a poetry of language, 
      or language poetry. Poetry is, after all, made of the stuff. Starting off 
      from its name, language poetry is a redundancy, the sort of thing we take 
      off for on our students' compositions. And nothing could be riskier than 
      discussing a radical and variegated poetic movement in terms of the 
      contributions furnished by a single one of its practitioners, Charles 
      Bernstein. Anything that his poetry and theorizing can say about other 
      splendid poets, including Susan Howe, <B>[End Page 1193]</B> Ron Silliman, 
      and Bruce Andrews may be limited, but not in an insignificant or 
      uninteresting way. 
      <P>Language poetry, both the term and the enterprise, may acquire 
      additional nuances when placed in context of some of the most significant 
      literary and theoretical developments of the past four decades. Like few 
      other moments in the history of culture—although there are important 
      parallels—the twentieth century, above all its linguistics, literature, 
      graphic art, and music arises in a vertiginous apprehension of the 
      linguistic constitution of what we think of as "Being" or "reality." Over 
      and over again, the linguistics of Saussure, the fiction of Kafka, Proust, 
      and Joyce, and the painting of Picasso and Klee remind us that the world, 
      such as we perceive, "experience," or conceptualize it, is comprised of 
      language, signs, and a rhetoric of tropes by which signs are 
      interconnected, rather than by any entity, essence, structure, or 
      discipline that "precedes" language in sequence or essentiality. The Freud 
      of <I>Studies on Hysteria</I>, <I>The Interpretation of Dreams</I>, and 
      <I>Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious</I> essentially knows this, 
      as do, in different ways, Robert Musil, Virginia Woolf, Gustav Mahler, and 
      Charles Ives. The forerunners (or perhaps better "furreigners") of 
      language poetry are as much in prose as in poetry, are as conceptual as 
      they are "aesthetic." 
      <P>A significant portion of the important conceptual work done in the 
      twentieth century, whether it coincides with or succeeds these esthetic 
      examples, revises the prevailing wisdom of the scientific and social 
      scientific disciplines in accordance with this basic apprehension of the 
      linguistic nature and dynamics of reality and its human understanding. 
      Heidegger, for example, demonstrates that if there must be anything so 
      fundamental and general as Being, it can only perform the complexity and 
      density of well-written poetic language. Foucault would treat history not 
      as the grand succession of events and concepts but rather as the 
      fluctuating epistemological horizon in which certain types of statement 
      become possible. 
      <P>Language predicates and structures the world, such as we are in a 
      position to apprehend, comprehend, or know it. Stein and Joyce are as 
      intensely aware of this as are Paul de Man or Jacques Derrida. This 
      apprehension is crucial. It is the stuff good poems are made of, yet it 
      places the practice of poetry in a slightly uncomfortable position. For if 
      poems are "made" of this apprehension, if they are objects in which the 
      language-nature of Being and reality have already been installed, 
      pre-programmed in an implicit or immanent way, how then are <B>[End Page 
      1194]</B> poems to register this distinctive twntieth-century "agenbite of 
      inwit" without in some sense relinquishing their poetic nature, without 
      becoming something other than poems, as traditionally understood. This is 
      a predicament in which any poetry of language, any poetry responding to 
      this sort of linguistic apprehension, would place itself. If the 
      linguistic constitution and motive of poetry shuttle from immanence and 
      silence to explicitness, can poetry still be poetry? Or will a mode of 
      poetic discourse have emerged that is somehow poetry and not poetry at the 
      same time, sharing the same bizarre fusion of organic and inorganic, dead 
      and living elements of Kafka's Odradek? <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT1" 
      name=REF1>1</A></SUP> Such an uncomfortable but at the same time funny and 
      mold-shattering poetry might well be something new under the sun. 
      <P>But this wider theoretical meditation is perhaps best reserved for 
      later. When language poetry becomes aware of itself, in the early 1970's, 
      it celebrates with exuberance the language-constitution of the world. 
      Poetry is no longer a rarified form of language, itself the abused 
      handservant of some overarching and prior truth or spirit. The world, such 
      as it exists, is already language, and poetry is the index, the very 
      culmination of this linguistic dynamics. The world is already a poem, 
      oftentimes a brutal and sad one, if we are only prepared to read and see 
      the lineaments of its composition. This is not the spiritually allegorical 
      world-poem that Foucault assigns to the Renaissance. <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT2" 
      name=REF2>2</A></SUP> The world is a text already there, under the service 
      of poets, not priests. The world is composed less of discrete works or 
      acts than of poetic substance of the sort initially synthesized by 
      Mallarmé, and introduced into the American vein by Stein, Pound, Williams, 
      and the objectivists. The poetic stuff of modernity and its implicit 
      successor, whatever it may be called, resides in the heart of the 
      economies of manufacture and waste. Wallace Stevens' dump is a privileged 
      site of its composition. By the time such poets as Susan Howe, Ron 
      Silliman, Bruce Andrews, and Bernstein discover that they have certain 
      complex poetry games in common, the linguistic material they work has long 
      derived from the repository of exhausted cultural remains, whose form is 
      the traditional rhetoric of poetry supplemented by the explosiveness of 
      modern poetic space. The raw material of poetry is signs with considerable 
      circulation to their credit. If there is a certain shopworn quality to 
      material deriving from the repository of exhausted cultural remains, we 
      regard this material with a certain distance as well, we "leverage" it 
      with the humor that becomes a distinctive mark of this type of poetry. 
      <B>[End Page 1195]</B> 
      <P>The poetry of language is hence free to celebrate the poetic 
      composition of a world knowable only as language. It is in this context 
      that Charles Bernstein writes, in an essay entitled "Thought's Measure." 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->Language is the material of both thinking and 
        writing. . . . Just as language is something that is not separable from 
        the world, but rather is the means by which the world is constituted, so 
        thinking cannot be said to 'accompany' the experiencing of the world in 
        that it informs that experiencing. It is through language that we 
        experience the world, indeed through language that meaning comes into 
        the world and into being. As persons we are born into language and 
        world; they exist before us and after us. Our learning language is 
        learning the terms by which a world gets seen. In talking about language 
        and thinking, I want to establish the material, the stuff of writing, in 
        order, in turn, to base a discussion of writing on its medium rather 
        than on preconceived literary ideas of subject matter or form. And I 
        want to propose 'thinking' as a concept that can help to materially 
        ground that discussion. <SUP><A 
        href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT3" 
        name=REF3>3</A></SUP> <!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>At the same time that Bernstein's addressing language as the substance 
      of writing and the world is clear, we do not wish, through any theoretical 
      fervor, to exclude the cognitive and sociological dimensions of his 
      critical scenario. Indeed, it is only through misreading that critical 
      theory, with its own grounding in the apprehension that language 
      structures the world, appears indifferent to these dimensions. Bernstein's 
      interest in the relation between language and thought opens poetic 
      thinking to the enterprise of logical analysis, which, I would argue, 
      resides at the spare or anorexic extreme of the distinctive literary 
      styles devised by twentieth-century discourse. Less important than the 
      formal characteristics of any of these styles is the fact that 
      twentieth-century literary and conceptual discourse has been uncomfortable 
      with residing in the middle ground of moderate prose; it has, rather, 
      gravitated, where possible, to the extremes illustrated, on the one hand, 
      by the precision, spareness, and depression of certain of Kafka's sketches 
      and the prose designed for Wittgenstein's <I>Tractatus 
      Logico-Philosophicus</I> and at the opposite end by the florid, endlessly 
      self-qualifying, and fussy stylistic medium common, in different ways, to 
      Proust's <I>Recherche</I>, <I>Finnegans Wake</I>, and the philosophical 
      discourses, respectively, of Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida. <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT4" 
      name=REF4>4</A></SUP> The play between the anorexic and florid extremes of 
      language is marvelous material for fiction as well as poetry, and language 
      poetry, in its appeal to Wittgenstein, no more excludes the poetics of 
      expansion explored by Heidegger and Derrida than should contemporary 
      literary criticism. The sociological dimension to the <B>[End Page 
      1196]</B> linguistic apprehension evident in Bernstein's "Thought's 
      Measure" is also hardly inimical to the concerns of contemporary theory. 
      Language not only composes reality, such as we know it; it is the 
      encompassing medium of communication between human beings. This poetry, in 
      referring back to the material of which it is made and the manner of the 
      world's composition, only augments the theoretical resources of its 
      readership. 
      <P>The poetry of language issues its birth announcement of itself in the 
      exuberance of its apprehension of the linguistic composition of reality, 
      thought, and culture. It is in this sense that the 1980 <I>LEGEND</I> 
      collaboration by Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Ray di Palma, and Ron 
      Silliman <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT5" 
      name=REF5>5</A></SUP> incorporates line drawings and cartoons, concrete 
      and geometrical arrangements of syllables and words as well as 
      recognizable compositions of free verse. As part of a multiform manifesto 
      of the priority of language in poetry and culture, <I>LEGEND</I> includes 
      compositions of hash-marks. Language, the collection illustrates, can be 
      entirely devoid of substance, whether regarded as content or extension, 
      and still compose itself in interesting ways. A sequence of cartoons 
      develops in a way not entirely alien to a sequence of stanzas or narrative 
      episodes. Every form of writing, demonstrates <I>LEGEND</I>, graphics as 
      well as words, the poetry of logical propositions and the poetry of free 
      verse, constitutes the Derridean trace, the rupture in Being and knowing 
      that is the site from which writing declares and performs its 
      primordiality, its inevitability. 
      <P>Within the context of the linguistic composition of the world, the 
      varieties of poetic utterance and discursive form are merely different 
      fruits of the season, to be enjoyed in their time and their difference. 
      Collations of Wittgensteinian propositions are no more authentic than 
      columns and diagonal slashes of inarticulate syllables. Both experiments, 
      and language poetry is a highly experimental mode of writing, have their 
      place. Through all the fashions of literature and intellectual history, 
      poetry has functioned as the preserve of language's exploration of its own 
      parameters and qualities. The poetry of language thus celebrates the 
      variety of modes and forms in which the fundamental linguistic 
      apprehension of the world takes place. 
      <H3><!--_a-head-->2. Let it Be Concrete <!--_/a-head--></H3>
      <P>Arising in an intellectual milieu at least to some extent disabused of 
      its logocentric and onto-theological delusions, language poetry includes 
      among its demonstrations the concrete handling of words, <B>[End Page 
      1197]</B> responding to their empirical qualities as things more than to 
      their ideational significations. The treatment of words as things, the 
      transformation of words into things corresponds to the diversion that 
      takes place when we focus on the soprano's zipper, and are deaf to her 
      song. In the case of <I>LEGEND</I>, among other examples, we hone into 
      such data as the shape and sound of words, syllables, or letter-clusters 
      either in place of, at the expense of, or in supplemental relation to the 
      "idea" that they might "convey." 
      <P>This field of poetry insists that the materiality of language be 
      accommodated within its register. Language comprises the building blocks 
      of any communicative or cultural production. It in turn incorporates its 
      own materiality. To speak to the materiality of language at once addresses 
      its non-ideational, non-metaphysical dimensions, and emphasizes its place 
      within an economy of production and reception, within economy per se. The 
      concrete handling of words and word fragments thus resides at the extreme 
      of language's generative capabilities. It also participates, however, in a 
      slowdown or defamiliarization of referential and logical functions that 
      otherwise become too easy. 
      <P>The syllabic experiments that abound in the <I>LEGEND</I> collaboration 
      thus correspond to an exploration of the dual referential surplus and 
      shortfall produced when words are treated in accordance with their thingly 
      facet. The collectively authored "Fantasy on a Hymn Tune" (and collective 
      authorship in poetry already constitutes an important questioning of the 
      sublimity of poetic genius or inspiration) begins with a syllabic matrix 
      or graph, whose initial x-axis reads "apl/epl/ipl/oopl/upl/opl," and whose 
      y-axis reads down, "apl/abl/afl/asl/adl/azl." The matrix goes on to 
      explore, between its axes, the other syllabic variants on these fragments. 
      This constellation amounts to a systematic treatment, a systamatization, 
      of unfulfilled semes, which, although capable of sustaining some meaning, 
      stop short of lexic definition. The poem thus begins in the shadowy world 
      between total nonsense, or a semantic void, and conventional meaning. The 
      following section of the poem, also a matrix, alternates lines consisting 
      of these unmeaning syllables with lines composed of slighly fuller 
      "extensions": "apl/epl/ipel/oopl/upl/opl" becomes "apple eppul ipel oopul 
      opal." We find two recognizable words in the latter line, "apple," and the 
      semiprecious "opal." The poem begins to inhabit that marginal space in 
      which the narrator of Borges' "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" isolates on a 
      map of an imaginary world two or three recognizable places from our own. 
      In gravitating toward concreteness, <B>[End Page 1198]</B> language poetry 
      has thematized and dramatized the limits of meaning, at lexic, semantic, 
      and syntactic levels. 
      <P>In the concreteness of its demonstration, <I>LEGEND</I> gravitates 
      toward the Wittgensteinian extreme of its utterance. In terms of the 
      experiment pursued by the <I>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</I>, the text 
      of this volume would reproduce a logically-constituted world, the world as 
      it would appear were it hypothetically composed according to the 
      propositions of logic. The elements of this world would be logical 
      propositions, and they would be related by mathematics and logical 
      operations. Such an experiment is of course doomed to failure, but it 
      makes for striking poetry as well as interesting reading. In addition to 
      asking us to "say no more than we can know," something harder for 
      academics than for practicing poets, such an enterprise treats 
      propositions (in poetry we would say lines) as the tangible components of 
      a world. Wittgenstein's philosophical project is willing to treat the 
      elements of discourse, whether regarded as logical propositions or lines, 
      as building blocks, construction elements, and regards the relations 
      between these elements as the possibilities of a logical or discursive 
      world. 
      <P>In at least one of its demonstrations, then, this poetry pushes 
      sentences toward the concreteness and rigor of propositions, and then 
      explores the possibilities opened up by their juxtaposition and 
      interrelation. This experiment works both to the effect of parodying 
      logical rhetoric and procedure and of installing a certain rigor within a 
      situation that might not readily appear to be the case. Wittgenstein is a 
      marvelous context for these particular experiments because he both 
      explored the claims and possibilities of language in general and because 
      he distilled such a distinctive minimalist style in constructing a picture 
      of the world as a constellation of logical propositions. The appeal of 
      this poetic state of affairs to Wittgenstein and critical theorists is not 
      anomalous. The vexed schism between "logical analysis" and "Continental 
      Philosophy" is one of the decisive optical illusions of the academic 
      world: both explored the lineaments of language, one in its hyperbolic, 
      the other in its stripped down articulation. It is in this context that we 
      can appreciate the poetic propositions in such <I>LEGEND</I> texts as 
      Bernstein's "My Life as a Monad," Ron Silliman's "It is a five-pointed 
      star . . ." and Ray DiPalma's "Perfect impressions give you lessons. . . 
      ." From the first of these we read, "39. Let's buy a box of bandaids," and 
      "89. On Monday I sail for Tunis." <B>[End Page 1199]</B> 
      <H3><!--_a-head-->3. Let it Be Poetry <!--_/a-head--></H3>
      <P>At the heart of his epoch-making "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," in 
      which he accounts for the disjunctiveness of modern experience at the same 
      time that he composes a structurally self-deconstructing text, Walter 
      Benjamin cites a captivating question by Baudelaire: "Who among us has not 
      dreamt, in his ambitious days, of the miracle of a poetic prose? It would 
      have to be musical without rhythm and rhyme, supple and resistant enough 
      to adapt itself to the lyrical stirrings of the soul, the wave motions of 
      dreaming, the shocks of consciousness." How curious and touching it is 
      that prose poetry, with its hovering at a discursive watershed, could 
      figure among the factors by which Benjamin would account for the "decline" 
      of modern experience, its structuration by the shocks which, in the 
      Freudian scenario, announce their impact in the penetration of defensive 
      shields, in the invasion of protected fields of energy. <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT6" 
      name=REF6>6</A></SUP> 
      <P>The division of labor between the poetic and the prosaic is an 
      implicitly rich field, made all the more interesting by such equations as 
      the one drawn by Hegel between prose and history. Language poetry does not 
      neglect to include this "demilitarized zone" in its multifaceted 
      exploration of the resources and performances available to poetry. The 
      poets of language are no more reverential toward a prescriptive division 
      of labor here than they are toward the bulk of the metaphysical and 
      aesthetic baggage that poetry-making drags with it. Bernstein's recent 
      "Artifice of Absorption" is in fact a theoretical essay, predominantly set 
      in verse, on the poetics of transparency and opacity as it conditions the 
      options currently available to poetry and other discourses. This text 
      furnishes a masterful demonstration to critics of how verse, with the 
      variable length of its lines and its freedom in the spatial arrangement of 
      words, offers certain features particularly suited to the logical turns 
      and delicate qualifications of theoretical discourse. On its side, 
      "Artifice of Absorption" performs many functions that we come to expect 
      from criticism: it pursues ongoing thematic issues, such as absorption and 
      opacity, in relation to a wide variety of literary and scholarly sources, 
      including Artaud, Bataille, Lévi-Strauss, Veronica Forrest-Thompson, and 
      Jerome McGann; it comes replete with footnotes. And yet, I would argue, 
      for all its receptivity to prose and its questioning of any privileged 
      position assigned to poetry, the poetry of language contributes above all 
      to the body and amplification of poetics. <B>[End Page 1200]</B> 
      <P>While Bernstein's work appeals to the prosaic as a defamiliarization 
      away from poetic convention, its insistence on discontinuity as a 
      compositional principle is too strong for it simply to merge into the 
      linear thrusts of conventional prose. Bernstein's writing is hardly 
      insensitive to the sustained linguistic defamiliarization performed by 
      Joyce's <I>Finnegans Wake</I>. Bernstein as well disfigures his words, 
      opens up his syntax, reduces his signifiers to their sub-verbal elements. 
      Yet with all its distortion on the microscopic level, <I>Finnegans 
      Wake</I> is invested in a certain narrative continuity, in the completion 
      of certain structural elements, however "soft" or self-effacing its 
      structure may be. For all its theoretical sophistication and technical 
      receptivity and improvisation, language poetry stops at the marvel of what 
      Baudelaire would call "prosaic poetry" before acceding to the linear 
      momentum of prose itself.

      <P>While this passage is indeed set in prose, it contains enough material 
      about perspective to explain that its prosaic interest emerges from an 
      exploration of the perspective of prose. The exploration is all. There is 
      a pronounced inconsequentiality about this prose. Where it leads, what it 
      accomplishes, is far less important than the mood it establishes, the 
      jarring juxtapositions (between the window frame and the boat) it effects, 
      and the discontinuities that it incorporates. This language is much 
      plainer than the discourse of <I>Finnegans Wake</I>: if poetry is simply 
      the play of language, we would have to think of <B>[End Page 1201]</B> 
      Joyce's novel as more poetic. Yet Joyce, in order to break and parody the 
      implicit habits of reading, relies heavily on narrative flow, on the 
      promises of conclusiveness made by all types of discourse. Prose 
      occasionally crystallizes within the experimental and theoretical space of 
      language poetry, but only as one additional mode of arrangement. The 
      promises it keeps last only as long as the experiments in which it 
      figures, and even within its scope, continuity is a promise existing 
      largely to be broken.

      <P>According to this passage, what Bernstein terms anti-absorptive works 
      "flaunt" their artifice, defined earlier as the "measure of a poem's / 
      intractibility to being read as the sum of its / devices &amp; subject 
      matters" (AA, 9). "Absorption may dissolve / into theater," he warns us 
      (AA, 30), and a "flaunting" of poetic qualities is manifestly theatrical. 
      The artifice of poetry is the supplement, the unknown quantity beyond the 
      themes and devices, and one of the crucial endeavors of language poetry 
      will be to dramatize this artifice, in the theatrical space furnished by 
      the blank page. It is in keeping with this dramatic impulse that Bernstein 
      and the poets he writes about will synthesize some of its most distinctive 
      styles: a serpentine poetry of dispersion, wandering about the page, 
      demonstrating the silence and emptiness surrounding its far-flung 
      signifiers; a rigid and erect lyric composed of ultra-short lines, 
      initially explored by Williams, emphasizing the mass of individual words 
      and the arbitrariness of line-breaks; and conventional lyrics, whose 
      seemingly ordinary lines camouflage unmarked deletions or bubbles of 
      introjection. <SUP><A

      <P>"Language poetry" synthesizes such stylistic models, and there are 
      others, not only for the sake of variety, but because each one is 
      particularly suited to dramatize—current psychoanalytical discourse would 
      say "act out"—specific features and activities of poetic composition: the 
      spacing of words on the page, their division into lines and stanzas, the 
      distinction between capital and miniscule letters, the <B>[End Page 
      1202]</B> latter tested fully in Bernstein's "Like DeCLAraTionS in a HymIE 
      CEMetArY." It is at least partially instructive to think of each distinct 
      discursive mode crystallized by language poetry as the poetic equivalent 
      of an elaborate Wittgensteinian language game. 
      <P>As one of its enterprises, then, the poetry of language would aim at a 
      making explicit of the linguistic acts and assumptions responsible for 
      poetry, in part because at other moments in the history of poetry, the 
      very same acts and assumptions have remained implicit, submerged, 
      understated, immanent—sustaining an ideology of poetic magic, genius, 
      wizardry, and inspiration. Poetry is for Kant the highest of the arts, the 
      native habitat for original genius. As Derrida, de Man, Foucault, and 
      others have pointed out, the presumptions of immanence and secrecy that 
      might surround poetic creation have been marshaled innumerable times in 
      support of ideological, political, and conceptual totalization and 
      repression. And if we appreciate the fact that an analogous explicitness, 
      or making explicit, of the ideological, logical, theological, and 
      metaphysical attitudes underlying vast stretches of Western or dominant 
      thought has comprised one of the ongoing efforts of contemporary critical 
      theory, it seems perfectly reasonable to assert that language poetry, in 
      its flaunting or dramatic dimension, is inherently theoretical, that 
      language poetry and critical theory are engaged, if not married, in a 
      joint endeavor of making explicit. 
      <P>While such an enterprise as deconstruction has also sought to dramatize 
      or figure, in a "positive" way, the departure of language from systematic 
      thought, the incommensurability and evanescence of language's 
      non-systematic traces, this figuring has always been founded on a 
      disclosure and release of the points of conceptual fixity or closure in 
      texts, artifacts, and systems. Such a conceptual release or uncoupling 
      absolutely depends on the making explicit of assumptions, biases, 
      orientations—the strong arms by which institutions, whether of state or 
      learning, twist the particulars into conformity with the ideological 
      thrust. Deconstruction thus goes hand in hand with a making explicit, an 
      expose, an investigative reportage concerning ideology's dirty secrets, 
      its smoke-filled back-rooms, where its findings and imperatives 
      collaborate with its concepts. 
      <P>"Language poetry" and critical theory thus share a certain commitment 
      to the explicit, to rendering overt and subject to question conceptual and 
      operational underpinnings which in the context of dominant culture are 
      hidden, occulted, sublimated, and a prioritized. Deconstruction is an 
      inherently public posture or set of strategies, in <B>[End Page 1203]</B> 
      a similar sense to the way in which language poetry demands explicitness 
      regarding its production and procedures. At the risk of relinquishing 
      time-honored conventions and techniques, language poetry participates in a 
      poetics of explicitness. Much of what Bernstein says about absorption 
      concerns the relationship between the implicit and the explicit. This 
      insistence on explicitness gives both deconstruction and language poetry a 
      certain political and ethical dimension. The enterprise of theorizing may 
      be in large measure regarded as an articulation or making explicit of what 
      makes states, systems, and other institutions go. Let's be clear, then, 
      that language poetry's theoretical dimension is not at odds with its 
      political interest or commitment; they are part and parcel of each other. 
      Language poetry doesn't privilege certain "socially oriented" forms of 
      theory over other more "cerebral" or "Continental" varieties. Its 
      theoretical nature is tantamount to its making explicit or its poetic 
      "acting out." 
      <P>The present point in my own exposition is the moment when one would 
      properly expect a lengthy and weighty digression on the theoretical and 
      philosophical backgrounds of language poetry. Yet for reasons cited above, 
      now is precisely the moment for us to delve into specific texts in a 
      specific way, to read them as closely as possible. The theory of language 
      poetry dwells not somehow apart from the poems themselves. It is 
      inscribed, invaginated within the poems. 
      <P>The poetics of explicitness, for example, does much to account for the 
      remarkably rich assortment of texts and experiments that Bernstein sets 
      out for us in <I>Controlling Interests</I>. "The Next Available Place" is 
      a veritable laboratory of associative chainings and thematic 
      displacements. A fragmentary and much-submerged narrative situation 
      suggests problematic travel arrangements to Africa. Difficult as it may be 
      to secure places on this journey, the language of the poem cannot control, 
      cannot resist, digressions and indirections of many, if not every, 
      possible order. The poem's progress is only too vulnerable to onomatopoeic 
      riffs: "Ether," "Esther," "Erstwhile"; "Orthopsychiatry, opthalometrics, / 
      gastrojejunerology, cryptopsychopathology, oncogenetics"; "Japanese shoe 
      repair. / Iraqi, Iroquois"; and, "Mrs. Happenstance had a happy / 
      hysterectomy" (the latter recalling Joyce's "do ptake some ptarmigan" in 
      <I>Ulysses</I>). <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT10" 
      name=REF10>10</A></SUP> Even in this sampling, the modes of expansion are 
      markedly different: the combination of Iraqis and Iroquois, although 
      happy, is almost purely assonant; the list of fantastic medical branches 
      begins in the assonance of "o-words," and culminates in increasingly 
      outrageous sciences ("cryptopsychopathology"). There may indeed be a 
      stroke of happiness in happenstance, <B>[End Page 1204]</B> but in all 
      likelihood the fictive character is not all that happy about her 
      hysterectomy: this chain of signifiers is crowned by irony. 
      <P>"The Next Available Place" is the only destination possible in playful 
      language. Yet the poem not only circumscribes several varieties of 
      indirection; it declares and dramatizes these tendencies as well. One line 
      exhorts us to "Pattern a once remembered hope that one time. Seepage." 
      "Seepage," like "pattern" is at once a thing and an activity. The poem 
      dramatizes a certain seepage taking place in signification and meaning, 
      the excess and superfluity in words that allows them to take unexpected 
      turns. The speech act performed by the line is demand, exhortation. The 
      line tells us to pattern forgotten hope—and to read: see the pages. The 
      French homonym of seepage is <I>cèpages</I>, the involuted plants of 
      viniculture. In the same gesture, then, the poem thematizes, exemplifies, 
      and critically problematizes the displacement taking place within its own 
      language. 
      <P>It is hardly out of place, then, within the contours of "The Next 
      Available Place," to come upon a language about twisting and involution: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><!--_poetry-->Curvacious slurs: misanthropy, cliquishness,

      <P>Apart from describing, on a discursive level if you will, a set of 
      spatial and stylistic options available to poetry, this passage pursues an 
      important interrogation into the status of psychological and 
      psychoanalytical categories within a linguistically aware poetic medium. 
      While psychoanalytical situations and terms are as interesting and 
      available as any other subject matter, it is clear that within the domain 
      of this poetics, such issues as vertigo, weakness or depression, and 
      regression ("backward swaying") must work themselves out poetically, on 
      the page: "Seepage." "Curvacious slurs" and "Labyrinthine irritation" make 
      for a fine interlude in "The Next Available Space," but these terms also 
      account for one of the major poetic styles or substances that language 
      poetry has synthesized as a medium for its dramatization of the qualities 
      of poetic language and space, what I <B>[End Page 1205]</B> have termed 
      above the poetry of dispersion or dissemination. In the context of 
      "Curvacious slurs" and "Labyrinthine irritations," it can be no accident 
      that the next poem in Controlling Interests, "The Hand Gets Scald But The 
      Heart Grows Colder," begins with precisely such a lyric, whose fragmentary 
      proto-lines, in order to accentuate their unrelatedness to each other, or 
      at least the tenuousness of the connections between them, are strewn over 
      the page, in "Curvacious slurs." 
      <P>The State of Maryland has been called a microcosm of America, because 
      within its relatively compact borders thrive most of the environments 
      spread out over the nation at large: mountains, big cities, suburbs, flat 
      farmlands. Within <I>Controlling Interests</I>, such poems as "The Hand 
      Gets Scald" and "Standing Target" encompass many of the styles that 
      language poetry has devised for its demonstrations: in addition to the 
      labyrinthine poem of dispersion, we find compact columns of ultra-short 
      lines, often themselves sub-verbal; nuggets of irregular lines which are, 
      through the density of their typesetting, at the edge of prose poetry; 
      and, last, but surely not least, "conventionally" appearing passages of 
      lyric that literally dissolve through their truncations and unannounced 
      bubblings. This anthologization of different styles is not in itself new: 
      in modern poetry it goes back at least as far as such Yeatsian medleys as 
      "Upon a Dying Lady." Yet what is striking about these experiments is the 
      extensiveness, and again, explicitness with which each stylistic medium 
      explores its unique linguistic capabilities at the same time that it 
      "processes," poetically more than psychoanalytically, the "material" at 
      hand. Thus, a poem much concerned with mood-swings, "The Hand Gets Scalder 
      but the Heart Grows Colder," is free to break off into a column of 
      capitalized colors, "Red / Pink / Orange / Pimento," and so on, which 
      them-selves "illuminate" different moods, or serve as a synesthetic 
      accompaniment, in terms of color, to such moods. The poem arises, of 
      course, in the confusion nurtured by the English language that the modal 
      (and caloric) opposition between scalding and coldness can be undercut by 
      a certain homonymic similarity. The heart can lose its sympathy regardless 
      of what is taking place physiologically or sexually. Whether we interpret 
      the hand's getting "scalder" in terms of thermodynamic loss or gain, the 
      "heart" can operate on its own wavelength. The poem goes on to play along 
      the rift between activity and affect, to sustain poetically a certain 
      disinterest. Remember that the book is entitled <I>Controlling 
      Interests</I>, that Walter Benjamin once appropriated a sterling image for 
      the actor's sensibility from Kafka's <B>[End Page 1206]</B> description of 
      hammering as "real hammering and at the same time nothing." <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT11" 
      name=REF11>11</A></SUP> 
      <P>By the same token, "Standing Target" is as autobiographical a text as 
      one can imagine belonging to the body of something called "language 
      poetry." The poem incorporates a biography of someone named Ralf D. Caulo, 
      "Deputy Director of the / HBJ School Department," and reports, presumably 
      from summer camp or early school, regarding the progress of someone named 
      "Charlie" in such areas as swimming and arts and crafts. On its 
      internalized bulletin-board, "Standing Target" displays corporate 
      biographies and snatches of Proustian recollection (and self-citation) to 
      illustrate the solidity and focus, the sense of meaning, continuity, and 
      prevailing that such discourses provide. At the same time, the poem begins 
      precisely nowhere, "Deserted all sudden a all / Or gloves of notion, 
      seriously / Foil sightings, polite society" (<I>CI</I>, 39)—and it does 
      not end before it has dissolved this biographical and existential 
      coherence in an unusually disparate lyric of dispersion, beginning, 
      "fatigue / of . . . of / open for / to, sees doubles" (<I>CI</I>, 45). The 
      poem duly notes the inevitable fatigue accompanying such intense awareness 
      of self-constitution only in language. It has already accounted for the 
      sadness of lines, "crisscrossing / out the hopes of an undifferentiated / 
      experience, the cold sweeps / past" (<I>CI</I>, 41), and it has 
      characterized the end results of an experience whose sudden separations 
      and voids, like going to summer camp, are as empty as the vacuums of the 
      poetic page: "The end result was a gradual / neurosis superimposed upon a 
      pre-existing / borderline character structure" (<I>CI</I>, 43). 
      <P>Within the radically variegated poetic space of "Standing Target," the 
      self, social life, and psychological experience, such as they exist, are 
      functions of poetic potentials and activities. Any coherence that seems to 
      emerge from the losses and separations that structure our experience is 
      subject to the unpredictable chaining and dispersion that prevail within 
      the poetic page. Each of the styles of poetry highlights different aspects 
      of linguistic ambiguity, flow, syntax, and semantic slippage. 
      <P>Even at the risk of fatigue, which it inventively avoids, Bernstein's 
      more recent work sustains this multifaceted exploration and dramatization 
      of distinct poetic modes in what Derrida would call their local 
      difference. Indeed, as the work proceeds, each different style or poetic 
      utterance seems to gain in resolve, increasing the incommensurability of 
      the "whole." The prose poems are only more unrepentant <B>[End Page 
      1207]</B> in their prosaicness, and the ultra-short lines have become, if 
      anything, only more abrupt and leaden. I think of Bernstein's 1987 
      collection, <I>The Sophist</I>, <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT12" 
      name=REF12>12</A></SUP> and I close my own initiation into his work and 
      the wider enterprise of those associated with him with the blurred and not 
      unjaundiced eye of "Amblyopia." 
      <P>Opening with a lyric of lines as stark, final, and blunt as anything 
      that language poetry could imagine, this poem goes on to cast its ambling 
      eye on the current state of cultural illiteracy. Sludge, stunted growth, 
      and the repression of criticism are among the most powerful images by 
      which this extended text articulates the current moment of cultural 
      blindness. "He was a moral dwarf in a body as / solid as ice," "Amblyopia" 
      begins, speaking of a hypothetical cultural subject in an age of "fear and 
      / evasion" (<I>S</I>, 112). We live in a time when "The world grows 
      simpler" (<I>S</I>, 121), the poem complains, "Many people have trouble 
      with everyday / activities, such as speaking, thinking, responding, 
      dreaming, eating, sleeping. A crutch / shares the weight of burden" 
      (<I>S</I>, 126). The state that Bernstein describes is one of enforced 
      cultural mutism, substance devoid of the articulation inseparable from 
      informed deliberation. Amid this darkness, "It is not the eye / but it's 
      the gleam of which we dream" (<I>S</I>, 118).

      <P>It should come as little surprise that Bernstein, as he elaborates the 
      socio-cultural conditions for this intellectual dimming and regression, 
      ranges widely in the institutions and rhetorics that he incorporates into 
      the poem. The poem's ongoing cultural and disciplinary perspectives are 
      psycho-sexual, economic, biological, and commercial. The "Ministry of 
      Psychological Science" issues a pronouncement in prose: "Exposure to big 
      businessmen, right-to-life Christians, military officers, career managers, 
      and New York Times cultural editors causes otherwise healthy young people 
      to become perverts. <B>[End Page 1208]</B> . . . Orgasms can only be 
      achieved by this kind of pervert by enacting or fantasizing racist, 
      sexist, ageist, or authoritarian acts" (<I>S</I>, 114-15). In this 
      passage, the biases of the culture industry are as oppressive as the 
      cultural wasteland. Bernstein's critique extends every much to the current 
      truisms put forth by the publicly sanctioned intellectual world as it does 
      to the sludge or blindness issuing from continued cultural 
      non-articulation. Hence,

      <P>The sludge of the inarticulate thus invades the institutions of 
      literacy, courtesy of Textron. What we have here so far in "Amblyopia" 
      corresponds in many ways to our model for a present and future language 
      poetry: it is vibrantly open to a wide range of rhetorics and technical 
      models; its poetic forms dramatize the subject-matter and discourse at 
      hand. It incorporates no less than three types of discourse: prose, 
      "conventional lyric," and a starkly abbreviated line. With all this 
      argumentation and social contextualization, "Amblyopia" is nowhere more 
      radical than where it appears most conventional. Indeed, this field of 
      poetry's most devastating theorizing, its most explosive undermining of 
      conceptual and formal expectations, may well take place in its most 
      conventional-seeming lyrics. The most profound revolution effected by 
      language poetry consists in the venerable lyrical contracts that it 
      refuses to honor; it is in the refusal to honor that the most devastating, 
      although nearly invisible, critique and theory of poetry takes place. The 
      most radical section of "Amblyopia" is hence severed from its polemic, 
      although a complex one, on the state of cultural articulation. It is 
      simply another lyric, <B>[End Page 1209]</B> potentially like any other. 
      In closing this fragmentary reading of the poem, I cite it:

      <P>This is precisely the poetry that cannot be read in the arena of 
      cultural amblyopia or stunting. It is pervaded by invisible breaks and 
      insertions that force it to violate the contract of making sense, even in 
      the permissive lyrical way. Like the late Joycean prose that arises in 
      Molly Bloom's monologue in the ultimate, "Penelope" episode of 
      <I>Ulysses</I>, this discourse absents itself of the breaks and markers in 
      flow that might clarify its intent. When coherent phrases begin to form, 
      they are truncated by introjections that emerge from nowhere. "Turn / out 
      of the last" begins, only begins to make sense at the top of this extract, 
      when "out of accumulated" enters, pulling the rug out from under its 
      sense-making. This is a poetry of invisible seams and invisibly introduced 
      bubbles. And yet it is very much poetry, indeed, it opens up the matrices 
      of meaning and sequential flow. It is radical in the sense that it exists 
      both within and beyond the framework of "Amblyopia," some of whose terms 
      we have explored. Some of Bernstein's poems, notably "So really not visit 
      a . . . ," in <I>Controlling Interests</I>, consist entirely of this 
      resistant but volatile discourse. This particular poetic stuff, with its 
      repudiation and intensification of poetic contracts, <SUP><A 
      href="http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:8201/journals/mln/v118/118.5sussman.html#FOOT13" 
      name=REF13>13</A></SUP> may well hover at the radical extreme of language 
      poetry's multifaceted, explicit, performative, and theoretical experiment. 
      <B>[End Page 1210]</B> 
      <H3><!--_a-head-->5. The Trial of the Explicit <!--_/a-head--></H3>
      <P>We come full circle as we close, asking ourselves if there is not some 
      bill we pay as poetry moves toward the extreme of its own explicitness, or 
      if perhaps, the poetry of language offers us a theoretical tool which now 
      helps us discern the glimmerings of explicitness within the ostensibly 
      traditional and naive. The question is parallel to the one we ask when we 
      ask if the overt experiments in line and color in modern painting do not 
      ultimately speak to the representational issues taken up by, say, Memling 
      or Rembrandt. 
      <P>Once poetry has problematized itself theoretically, once it has 
      performatively indicated and questioned its moves, can it ever be exactly 
      the same as before? Perhaps not. Previously, poetic discourse had if 
      nothing else irony to place in relief and at a certain distance its 
      affirmations. It may be, though, that in a systematically experimental 
      universe of letters, one joined, in different ways, by Joyce, Kafka, and 
      Wittgenstein as well as more contemporary experimentalists, irony loses 
      some of its pervasiveness and becomes one possibility amid a battery of 
      distortions available to poetic and fictive discourse. 
      <P>Must we experience this internal theorizing of poetry through the 
      making explicit of its moves and attitudes as a loss? Here both 
      contemporary critical theory and the poetry itself have much to say. 
      Rather than a loss or deprivation, this experiment constitutes an opening, 
      vastly extensive if a bit frightening. We are indeed fortunate that the 
      experiment has been taken up in such a playful and inventive way. <BR><BR>

      in our later parlance and disproportionately colors our attitudes toward
