<p>Reading &#147;In Particular,&#148; the first of the four poems gathered into 
  <i>Let&#146;s Just Say</i>, an intensely beautiful chapbook by Charles Bernstein 
  just out from Chax Press, I remembered listening to Charles read the poem aloud 
  last fall at The New School as part of the launch activities for Short Fuse: 
  The Global Anthology of New Fusion Poetry, edited by Todd Swift &amp; Phil Norton, 
  where the poem first appeared. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the time I remember being struck, as I have on other occasions when I&#146;ve 
  heard Charles read, especially over the past decade, at the degree to which 
  Bernstein reminds me of the late Allen Ginsberg. They&#146;re very different 
  people, poets &amp; readers, of course, but what they share in common is a fundamentally 
  satiric approach to their art, an approach that, it seems to me, is not always 
  understood or appreciated as such. In part, I suppose, that&#146;s because our 
  culture &#150; Official Verse Culture as Charles would say (OVC), tho the issue 
  extends beyond just that slice of the aesthetic torte &#150; tends to devalue 
  satire. But this similarity also is because each poet ultimately has proven 
  so important to the history of American letters that their presence &amp; influence 
  can&#146;t be understated. One way not to understate their importance, by this 
  convoluted logic, is to understate the role of the comedic in their work. They&#146;re 
  hardly the first writers to suffer this misimpression &#150; you have to wade 
  through a lot of critical worshipfulness to reach the clowning in Pound or Joyce 
  as well &amp; a lot of readers still don&#146;t get it in Olson.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bernstein has inoculated himself from this problem partly by approaching the 
  problem as Stein did, foregrounding humor. But he has also inoculated himself 
  from the one problem that Stein in her lifetime never solved &#150; not being 
  taken seriously &#150; through as judicious a management of OVC institutions 
  as any poet in my generation.* Bernstein Amid the Bureaucracies will someday 
  make for a fascinating exploration of the social structures surrounding verse 
  at the end of the 20th century &amp; start of the next. And it should be noted 
  that Charles was careful not to foreground humor too often too early in his 
  career. Whether one reads the narrative of publication as one of evolution, 
  Bernstein becoming more of a comic over time, or one of the careful sequencing 
  of disclosure as to just how funny he is, Bernstein is now clearly in a position 
  to do what he wants, when he wants, how he wants. For an artist, that is as 
  close to a perfect situation as one could imagine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#147;In Particular&#148; is a poem of 107 lines, virtually every one of which 
  consists entirely of a complex noun phrase involving a person. Here is the opening 
  passage, revised slightly from the version that appeared in Short Fuse:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A black man waiting at a bus stop<br>
  A white woman sitting on a stool<br>
  A Filipino eating a potato<br>
  A Mexican boy putting on shoes<br>
  A Hindu hiding in igloo<br>
  A fat girl in blue blouse<br>
  A Christian lady with toupee<br>
  A Chinese mother walking across a bridge<br>
  A Pakistani eating pastrami<br>
  A provincial walking on the peninsula<br>
  A Eurasian boy on a cell phone<br>
  An Arab with umbrella<br>
  A Southerner taking off a backpack<br>
  An Italian detonating a land mine<br>
  A barbarian with beret<br>
  A Lebanese guy in limousine<br>
  A Jew watering petunias<br>
  A Yugoslavian man at a hanging<br>
  A Sunni boy on scooter<br>
  A Floridian climbing a fountain<br>
  A Beatnik writing a limerick<br>
  A Caucasian woman dreaming of indecision<br>
  A Puerto Rican child floating on a balloon<br>
  An Indian fellow gliding on three-wheeled bike<br>
  An Armenian rowing to Amenia<br>
  An Irish lad with scythe<br>
  A Bangladeshi muttering questions<br>
  A worker wading in puddles<br>
  A Japanese rollerblader fixing a blend<br>
  A Burmese tailor watching his trailer</p>
<p>The last two lines of the poem reiterate in inverted form (but with the gender 
  of the figures switched) the first two above.** While each line presents a complete 
  image, if not statement, there are no predicates here &#150; essentially the 
  same formula as Sitting Up, Standing, Taking Steps. But where my 1978 prose 
  poem focused on the question of what happens to predication &amp; action when 
  the verb is absent, Bernstein, by virtue of a much stricter parallelism, focuses 
  instead on the construction of figures, one might say of social personhood. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bernstein first begins to reveal his strategy to the reader in the fifth line, 
  an incongruous juxtaposition of a Hindu &#147;in (article absent) igloo.&#148; 
  The lines aren&#146;t depictive, but representative, specifically of categories 
  &amp; structures. It very quickly becomes evident that each element in these 
  seemingly simple ensembles is built up out of a repertoire of social codes that 
  can fit together with the substitutability of a child&#146;s toy &#150; insert 
  your favorite image of Legos, Tinker Toys or Mr. (or Mrs.) Potato Head here. 
  Yet the humor rises precisely where (&amp; how, &amp; why) terms aren&#146;t 
  infinitely interchangeable. The presumed social neutrality &#150; the &#147;purity&#148; 
  &#150; of syntactic structures becomes clotted, clouded &amp; lumpy as the real 
  world, with all of its biases &amp; complex schema of race, class, age, body 
  type, religion or what have you attempt to pass through it. This literally is 
  the content of the two epigrams that head up the body of Bernstein&#146;s text, 
  the first from his son Felix:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>I admit that beauty inhales me<br>
  but not that I inhale beauty</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&amp; the second ascribed to &#147;the genie in the candy store&#148;:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>My lack of nothingness</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bernstein&#146;s point, to the degree that a comic poem can be characterized 
  as didactic, is that Chomsky&#146;s infamous impossible sentence, Colorless 
  green ideas sleep furiously,&#148; becomes such in the everyday world &#150; 
  the sentence has long been shown to be meaningful within the realm of poetry 
  &#150; not for reasons of grammar, but reasons of society. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>* Admittedly, Bernstein has not had as tough a problem in this regard. Stein 
  seriousness was discounted because she foregrounded humor, but also because 
  of her gender &amp; sexual orientation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>** It would be a whole other discussion, although one worth having, to consider 
  whether such a gesture toward symmetry &#150; really a bracketing effect &#150; 
  constitutes real closure, a gesture toward closure or even possibly a satire 
  of it.<br>
