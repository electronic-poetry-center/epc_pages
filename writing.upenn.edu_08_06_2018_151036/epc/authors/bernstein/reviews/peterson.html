                              <h2>December 23, 2004</h2>
                              <h3></h3>
                              <p>To finish the season here, I'd like to talk about 
                                the Analogous Series reading with <a href="http://www.analogous.net/bernsteinbee.html">Susan 
                                Bee and Charles Bernstein</a> which took place 
                                a few weeks ago. It was really a pleasure to have 
                                Charles and Susan in town to give a talk about 
                                their collaborations with various different people, 
                                and I like this notion, similar to what Silliman 
                                was talking about this week, of a &quot;poet's 
                                talk,&quot; which is not necessarily academic 
                                but is concerned with practice and process, and 
                                done by poets and artists for other working poets 
                                and artists.</p>
                              <p>Susan, who is a painter by profession and who 
                                does a lot of collaborative projects, mainly focused 
                                on the book arts in her talk, showing slides from 
                                books she has done with Bernstein, Susan Howe, 
                                and Joanna Drucker. She also brought physical 
                                copies of the books along so we could look at 
                                them during the break and after the talk. The 
                                first piece she showed was <em><a href="../../bee/images/fools.jpg">Fool's 
                                Gold</a></em>, a fold-out broadside/book arts 
                                piece done by Charles Alexander at Chax Press 
                                which featured text by Bernstein interspersed 
                                with images by Bee -- playfulness was the most 
                                striking element here, a willingness to cut loose. 
                                Contrast this with the much more graphically and 
                                typographically traditional <em><a href="http://www.analogous.net/bernsteinbeecollab.html">The 
                                Nude Formalism</a></em> -- or is it? The design, 
                                though ornamental and neoclassically concerned 
                                with framing the poems (strange putti frisk through 
                                various borders), is erratic and funny also and 
                                changes dramatically from poem to poem. When Bernstein 
                                read one of these pieces, a quite hilarious Elizabethan-sounding 
                                parody called &quot;Gosh,&quot; I was surprised 
                                by how slowly and seriously he read it, with a 
                                kind of ceremony which deepend the experience, 
                                or at last made you think about the poem carefully 
                                on a sonic level. </p>
                              <p>Bee's other collaborations with Susan Howe (Bed 
                                Hangings) and with Joanna Drucker (<a href="http://www.analogous.net/beedruckercollab.html">A 
                                Girl's Life</a>) were respectively severe and 
                                wild, both wonderful. These pieces introduce interesting 
                                additional issues that would not be present with 
                                poems or images alone: how to put a book together, 
                                for example -- how should it be laid out and designed, 
                                how should the material be distributed. These 
                                books were really made to fit the content. I found 
                                my favorite pieces here worked on the model of 
                                the Chax piece, freer and more immediate in the 
                                exchange of text and image, for example Susan's 
                                paintings such as <a href="../../bee/images/amor-perdido.jpg">Amor 
                                Perdido</a> which took pieces of Bernstein's poems 
                                and actually inserted them into the paintings 
                                as slips of paper, varnished over. There seems 
                                to be a lot that Susan and Charles have in common: 
                                playfulness coexisting with a sinister or dark 
                                quality, the use of a noir vocabularly, unsympathetic 
                                bouts of entertaining rhetorical hysteria, also 
                                bits of recognizable scenes chopped up and reassembled. 
                              </p>
                              <p>Some of the most moving and strange pieces here, 
                                I thought, were her more recent paintings such 
                                as &quot;<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bee/images/See-no-Evil-100dpi.JPG">See 
                                No Evil</a>,&quot; an almost symbolist-like composition 
                                featuring a large, bifurcated tree in a surreal 
                                geometric backdrop. The branches of this tree 
                                extend to culminate at the ends in objects like 
                                a Marilyn Monroe head, which is somehow really 
                                horrifying under the circumstances. I asked Susan 
                                about this dark quality in a lot of her paintings, 
                                because it's obviously not the darkness that we 
                                find in the male uncanny of surrealist automatism 
                                (her work with the journal M/E/A/N/I/N/G in the 
                                late eighties and nineties established among other 
                                thing how this category is not really a useful 
                                way to look at the work of female artists). Susan 
                                agreed that she felt the paintings were dark, 
                                but wasn't sure she could or wanted to talk about 
                                why, just that she had noticed this and was aware 
                                of it.</p>
                              <p>Charles' talk focused mostly on his collaboration 
                                with Richard Tuttle, the conceptual artist. The 
                                two of them <a href="../../../features/poetryplastique/Images/With_Strings/WithStrings1.JPG">made 
                                a piece together</a> that was based on Charles' 
                                poem &quot;With Strings,&quot; and employed a 
                                procedure/pattern: Tuttle built large styrofoam 
                                letters corresponding with the first letter of 
                                each line of the poem, and then printed the text 
                                of the entire poem on a typed strip of paper running 
                                around the edge of each of these letters. The 
                                letters in turn were pierced upon and threaded 
                                through a large metal coil which sat on the floor 
                                of the gallery. Most of the physical construction 
                                was done by Tuttle, and Charles made a joke about 
                                this at one point by showing a slide with Tuttle 
                                and himself &quot;at work&quot; in the studio: 
                                Tuttle is hammering away at something while Bernstein 
                                stands there intently examing one of the letters, 
                                &quot;kibbitzing,&quot; as he put it. They are 
                                both very absorbed in their tasks. </p>
                              <p>Charles also read a number of poems, including 
                                &quot;Without Strings&quot; itself as well as 
                                one short poem from <em>World on Fire</em>, &quot;Didn't 
                                We.&quot; The best experience of the whole evening, 
                                I thought, was the second half of the reading: 
                                Charles read two dramatic and very moving long 
                                poems, &quot;<a href="../poems/war_stories.html">War 
                                Stories</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://bostonreview.net/BR25.2/bernstein.html">Stelae 
                                for Failed Time</a>&quot; (a text written in the 
                                voice of Benjamin's angel of history, which is 
                                currently being made into an <a href="../shadowtime/index.html">opera</a>) 
                                while Susan showed some of her aforementioned 
                                newer paintings as a backdrop. These beautifully 
                                sad, urgent poems, occasionally resetting themselves 
                                with their own reproducibility of gesture via 
                                refrain (&quot;journeyed back&quot;) with estranging 
                                forays into the nonsensical and the foreign, were 
                                perfectly timed amid the election aftermath and 
                                the war, which were on everyone's mind still that 
                                night. But there was playfulness and humor in 
                                the performance as well -- halfway through the 
                                reading Charles made a rather dadaesque gesture 
                                and said &quot;I think I'm going to come sit behind 
                                you now,&quot; and walked out and sat in back 
                                among the audience. Some people turned around 
                                to look at him, but what most of us saw for the 
                                remainder of the reading were these rather purgatory-esque 
                                noir landscapes inhabited by the ghostly, floating 
                                voice of Charles Bernstein, and that was just 
                                fabulous.</p>
                              <p>After the reading a lot of people looked at the 
                                books Susan brought (very good audience for this 
                                event -- one of the biggest yet), and a number 
                                of us adjourned to Legal Seafood over across the 
                                street. I had a long time to talk with the two 
                                of them because we spent so long waiting for a 
                                table, and one of the things I discovered was 
                                that Charles does not come from any kind of academic 
                                background -- indeed this seems to evade the kinds 
                                of comments by Allen and others that they find 
                                his personality to be &quot;<a href="http://tribute-airy.blogspot.com/2004/11/back-from-beebernstein-thing.html">professorial</a>.&quot; 
                                On the contrary, I discovered that his father 
                                was a dressmaker. This brought to mind for me 
                                these words from his poem &quot;Lines&quot;: &quot;my 
                                father pushed a line / of ladies dresses, not 
                                down the street / in a pushcart, but upstairs 
                                in a fact'ry / office. My mother has been more 
                                concerned / with her hemlines.&quot; How amazing 
                                to realize that those lines are actually biographical 
                                -- I had thought they were merely rhetoric or 
                                surreal props when I first read the poem. It's 
                                fascinating to learn that Bernstein's life does 
                                actually intersect with his work this way, though 
                                at oblique angles and at the edges of the engagement 
                                with language. </p>
                              <p>Another example is the<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bernstein/poems/self-help.html"> 
                                recent poem</a> posted on the Buffalo list which 
                                establishes a pattern of complaining and then 
                                trying to find an upside to the situation, often 
                                to very comic effect. Bernstein said this poem 
                                came out of a personal experience of waiting at 
                                the restuarant while everyone else had already 
                                gotten their food (&quot;Lake Tang Woo Chin Chicken 
                                with Lobster and Sweet Clam Sauce still not served 
                                and everyone else got their orders twenty minutes 
                                back. - Savor the water, feast on the company.&quot;). 
                                For some reason this poem was one of the few things 
                                that could make me laugh following the horrible 
                                recent election, I think because it's so exasperated. 
                                But even here we can see an aspect of his limits 
                                foregrounded too -- the humor is ultimately a 
                                blocked or very dark thing, and ultimately recognizes 
                                that reality affects language but that it very 
                                rarely goes vice-versa. So there's a veering-away 
                                at the end, a sadness which dovetails towards 
                                resolution for the sake of the poem itself, turning 
                                inward: &quot;Self help -- Other drowns.&quot; 
                                If only we could indeed recover that sense of 
                                empathy in public discourse.</p>
                              <p>It was fun hanging out with Charles and Susan 
                                after the reading and discussing everything from 
                                digital poetry to kids to early American musicals 
                                -- we heard a lot of lines from Charles, who is 
                                really quite hilarious in person, from Cole Porter 
                                songs, Porgy and Bess, and other classics, looked 
                                at with an eye for the pastiche of appreciation 
                                in ironic contemplation. This was great for me, 
                                because I'm a fan of bad puns. An important element 
                                of the New York school which people often denigrate 
                                or dismiss as fluff (and which Bernstein gets 
                                from Ashbery) is the moment where something very 
                                funny suddenly causes the bottom to drop out and 
                                opens up into something very serious and dark. 
                                Jokes are serious and substantial things, because 
                                what makes us laugh is the unconscious frame of 
                                reference by which we evaluate experience: this 
                                is an important aspect of poetry I learned from 
                                my friend Tenney Nathanson, who not coincidentally 
                                has done some wonderful writing on Bernstein's 
                                work. In any case, an eye for the potentially 
                                embarrasing or awkward funny moments can be revealing 
                                in this sense, I think. Thanks again to everyone 
                                involved who made this series such a success the 
                                first season: Kelly Sherman for helping with publicity, 
                                Gerrit Lansing, Ruth Lepson, Jack Kimball, Christina 
                                Strong, James Amanda&nbsp; and Abi Cook, Sean

                                Mark Lamoureux and Rachel for varying degrees 
                                of devoted attendance and moral support (like 
                                carrying the AV equipment), and all the others 
                                involved. This has been really fun, and we're 
                                about to do it again!</p>
