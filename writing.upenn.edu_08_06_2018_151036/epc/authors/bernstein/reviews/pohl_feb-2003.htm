<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>POETRY<BR><B>INNOVATIVE MAGAZINE HELPS TO 
CREATE 'LANGUAGE POETRY'</B><BR>R.D. POHL<BR>Special to The 
News<BR><BR>02/02/2003<BR>Buffalo News<BR>FINAL<BR>G6<BR>(Copyright

<P>
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>This month marks the 25th anniversary of 
the first issue of "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E," the groundbreaking magazine published by 
then New York City-based experimental poets Bruce Andrews and <B>Charles</B> 
<B>Bernstein</B>. In its 13 issues and three supplements published from 1978 to 
1981, the magazine -- which was produced as coverless photocopied and stapled 
booklets -- had an influence on contemporary writing and poetry that far 
outstripped its modest origins, ultimately lending its name to a constellation 
of writing and thinking about writing that came to be known as "Language 
Poetry." 
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>In a 1986 interview, Bernstein recalled the 
motivation to publish the magazine arose from correspondences he was having with 
Andrews and San Francisco-based poet Ron Silliman about reconceptualizing the 
role of poetry: "The impulse for the magazine was to make that kind of exchange 
-- more public, to share the thinking and conceptualizing with as large a group 
as we could interest." Implicit in the exchange was a critique of mainstream 
literary culture in the United States (which Bernstein dubbed our "official 
verse culture") for its willfully naive assumptions about the transparency of 
language, coherence of a narrative "self," and self- limiting assumptions about 
gender and social class.<BR>
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>A quarter of a century later, Bernstein -- 
who will read from his work at 2 p.m. Feb. 23 at the Burchfield-Penney Art 
Center at Buffalo State College -- is recognized as perhaps our leading advocate 
and most articulate spokesperson for critical reading strategies, innovative 
poetries, and writing as the exploratory trace of human consciousness in 
American literary culture. He is the author of more than 20 books of poems, 
essays, speeches and other hybrid forms including such recent titles as "My Way: 
Speeches and Poems" (1999), "Republics of Reality: 1975-1995" (2000) and "With 
Strings" (2001). 
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>For the past 14 years, he has held the Gray 
Chair in Poetry and Letters at the University at Buffalo and directed the UB 
Poetics Program, where his accomplishments include co-founding the Electronic 
Poetry Center (widely regarded as best free online resource center on 
contemporary American poetry) and curating the extraordinary Wednesdays at 4 
Plus Series of poetry readings, lectures, discussions and performances at UB. I 
caught up with Bernstein between classes last week at UB, and we began this 
discussion, which continued on in the form of e-mail over the course of several 
days. 
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>Q: A quarter-century after the first issue 
of "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E," do you think any of the central tenets of "Language 
Poetry" have been assimilated by what you once referred to as our "official 
verse culture"? What do you think the legacy of the magazine and the "movement" 
it lent its name to will be? 
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>A: There has been a shift in poetry 
culture, for sure: a greater openness on the part of a large number of poets and 
committed readers to engage with many more stylistic and formal and conceptual 
approaches to poetry. And there has come with that a more profound 
acknowledgment of the legacy of radical modernist American poetry. At the same 
time, the national media -- what I like to call the "mediocracy" -- has, if 
anything, gotten worse, with newspapers like the New York Times doing an 
embarrassingly incompetent job in their coverage of contemporary poetry, in 
comparison for example to their coverage of the other arts. But there is an 
interesting paradox in your question, or anyway in my sense of the issue: The 
poetry I have been professing all these years wants to be assimilated (or 
accepted), but on its own terms, including its resistance to assimilation. But 
then you don't go to poetry for consistency, or at least I don't. I like the 
lumps and so I guess I have to take them, too. I appreciate your question (about 
the legacy of the magazine), but for me the fact that this remains unknown is a 
reason to continue on since the value is, as Gertrude Stein once wrote, not in 
what is won but in what is done. 
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>Q: Under your leadership over the past 14 
years, UB's Poetics Program (which offers a doctorate rather than an MA or MFA 
as most graduate writing programs do) has become increasingly prominent on the 
national scene as a result of its advocacy of innovative and experimental 
poetries and the fact that it has graduated a number of talented younger 
poet/critics who have been hired at schools like Temple, Harvard, U/Mass and 
Wesleyan. How does the program reflect your ideas on how contemporary 
poetry/poetics should be taught? 
<P><FONT face=helvetica,arial size=2>A: A key feature of the graduate Poetics 
  Program is that we are not a creative writing program but a creative reading 
  program. Graduate students come to Buffalo to research poetry and also to create 
  it, to write critical essays and also edit literary magazines, to teach and 
  also to give (and curate) poetry readings. The formal, academic part of the 
  program -- the seminars and the dissertations -- concentrate on poetics and 
  critical thinking. So it isn't just a matter of "what" or "who" we teach, but 
  also how we teach and the collective energies that emerge out of that work. 
  So, yes, it has certainly brought to UB a stellar set of poets and scholars, 
  many of whom have gone on to get good jobs and produce terrific and influential 
  work. But while most of the attention to Poetics is, appropriately, focused 
  on the graduate program and the Electronic Poetry Center (which was founded 
  by Loss Glazier in the mid-1990's), for me one of the most satisfying and successful 
  parts of my work at UB has been developing an undergraduate Poetics program. 
  Here undegraduates get a chance to talk to visiting poets and writers almost 
  every week and also get a chance to have an intimate engagement with modern 
  and contemporary poetry through interactive reading workshops. For many students, 
  it's their most intense encounter with contemporary art.<BR>
