      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In the past few 
        years, Charles Bernstein has gained national reputation for his involvement 
        with what he and others have described and defined as “Language” poetry. 
        But that reputation has accrued more as a result of his theories than 
        of his poetic output (amazingly, nine books to date); and, invariably, 
        it is more of his poetic practices than of specific poems of which his 
        critics and admirers write and speak. Much of this focus has been incalcated 
        by Bernstein himself; like Ezra Pound earlier iln this century, Bernstein 
        (as well as other “Language” poets) has felt the need to write about writing 
        almost as actively as to write poetry. Indeed, for this author, as for 
        many contemporary writers, there has been a purposeful equivocation of 
        the lingusitc activity of creating a poetics by which to live and that 
        of creating an artifact. That Bernstein’s particular poetics, moreover, 
        has been perceived as a kind of “warrior” movement–is a poetics that has 
        enraged as many readers as it has engaged–has helped to divert attention 
        from the his poems to his allegiances.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     Concomitantly, 
        it is clear that many critics of contemporary poetry find it terribly 
        difficult to discuss a particular poem that is not <i>about</i> something, 
        but <i>is</i> something “fixed “ in perpetual process. Reflecting this, 
        obviously, is the conversion from New Critical practices to Phenomenologist, 
        Structuralist, Semiotic, and other methodologies–all shifts from a reading 
        of the poem to an exploration of what causes and determines the poetic 
        act. But although this has been a healthy antidoe to the textual stupor 
        into which American critics of previous decades had fallen, for younger 
        poets it has resulted in a radical disregard of their writings. This is 
        particularly unfortunate in this instance, for not only have Bernstein’s 
        ideas stirred and stimulated the literary community, but his poems are 
        some of the most original and imaginative of American lyric verse. Those 
        of his recently collection, <i>Controlling Interests</i>, especially lie 
        in wait for a <i>con</i>textual reading, if not for an old-fashioned textual 
        one.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     Certainly, 
        these poems represent a great many of the “Language” strategies. Passages 
        from “The Next Available Place” and “Standing Target” can almost be read 
        as paradigms for the extensive use of alliteration, onomatopoeia, aural 
        and visual punning, syntatic fragmentariness, enjambment, and outright 
        glossolalia that characterize much of “Language” writing. In such passages–</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">                           
           Dread, scuzzy. Perhaps Polish (polish). I</font></p>

        myself. ...               (“The Next Available Place, p. 32)––</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Bernstein evinces 
        his commitment to a poetry of thinking in process and demonstraes the 
        “controlling interests” of a literary mode that permits the “leaps, jumps, 
        fissures, repetitions, bridges, schisms, colloquialisms, trains of associations, 
        and memory” that are integral to the music and rhythm of contemplation 
        “as it is being lived in a body” (see Bernstein’s essay, “Thought’s Measure,” 
        collected in <i>Content’s Dream</i>). In these poems, there is an enigmatic, 
        charm-like effect, an almost cabalistic quality which is alien and even 
        frightening to a society that still believes that reading a poem is related 
        to an <i>explication de texte</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     What Bernstein’s 
        poetry demands of us is that we be intuitive as we are analytic, that 
        we use the right side of our craniums as much as the left. Reading a poem, 
        Bernstein’s writing implies, is an act that permits the reader to bring 
        the unrational into touch with reason, that allows the reader to hear 
        the unspoken self in the voice of its hegemonical sister. Meaning, accordingly, 
        is not a closed system; the author does not declare ideas cloaked in poetic 
        language, but rather, through his language explores a range of ideas and 
        experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     The first few 
        lines of “Sentences My Father Used,” for example, seeingly abandon the 
        reader to a landscape of uninterpretable fragments:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">                           
           Casts across otherwise unavailable fields.</font></p>

        in its.  .... (p. 21)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Who or what is “casting” 
        in the first line of this passage? Of what “fields” is the poet speaking, 
        and why are they “otherwise unavailable?” Who or what “Makes plain” in 
        the second line, and what is being “made plain” or “explained?” Who or 
        what is “ruffled,” and does the word here mean “irritated,” “undualated,” 
        or “gathered along one edge?” Who is trying to “alleviate his false,” 
        and where is the object? <i>What</i> is “false?” These and dozens of such 
        questions understandably lmay discourage the uninitiated reader. Yes he 
        who would turn away would miss the point and experience of reading this 
        remarkable work. For, the meaning does not lie in answers, but in the 
        very questions which the poem generates. The “indeterminancy” of this 
        sort of poetry, as Marjorie Perloof argued in her <i>Poetics of Indeterminancy</i> 
        (1981), permits us to receive its images as “living phenomena,” as words 
        that exist in a fluid and plastic relationship.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">      It doesn’t 
        really matter that we cannot determine immediately who or what “casts 
        across” the “fields,” for the action occurs even without its subject, 
        an action that not only “reveals” or “manifests” itself (“makes plain”), 
        but also “begets” (another meaning of “makes”) a “plain,” a flat or level 
        field. Similarly, it isn’t important to know who or what is “ruffled,” 
        for the word alone serves to signify simultaneously a “vexation” or “irritation” 
        (perhaps because the fields are “otherwise unavailalbe?”), a sudden “undulation” 
        (of the flat “plain?”), and a “gathering [of people] along one edge” (of 
        the now <i>available</i> “fields?”) The floowing phrase introduces a male 
        subject through the pronoun, and the reader cannot help but connect him 
        with the previous actions and with the title of the poem. But even this 
        new information is framed in aposiopesis, is cut off in mid-sentence, 
        so that the reader must continue the process of relating word to word, 
        line to line in order to discern the object of the father’s “false” (“faults?”). 
        Like a detective, the reader must (re)construct the details, must (re)build 
        the poem to its meaning. As the author implies in the first lines, one 
        comes to “realize” the poem “slowly,” “through surprising details that 
        hide more than announce” (p. 21).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     In saying this, 
        Bernstein is not arguing for obscuratism, but for a poetry in which the 
        reader must use all of his or her faculties, in which he must “listen” 
        for meaning as well as look for it. The reader of this poem cannot read 
        merely at the level of the denotation or connotation of the words, but 
        must experience their rhythms, sounds, and patterns the way one might 
        read a score for orchestra. As any musician knows, a successful interpretation 
        of a symphony depends not only upon reading notes, but upon playing with 
        the nuances of phrase, rhythm, volume, pitch, and timbre; similarly, Bernstein 
        requires that the performer of his poem attend to all the nuances of language.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     That is not 
        to suggest that in a poem such as “Sentences My Father Used,” style outweighs 
        content. The attentive reader soon discovers that the poems does have 
        denotative/connotative meanings. As we (re)construct the poem, we encounter 
        the poet’s father, a man who has gone through life in “shut belief,” with 
        “a sense of purpose divorced from meaning.” Having put “everything....into 
        the business,” he is isloated from family, friends, and life itself. The 
        concerns of the poem–“Could life have been different?” “Is there hope 
        for change, a possibility to ‘recover what was in your pocket, the watch 
        your / parent gave you if you would only milnd / the hour’” (p. 27)–are 
        issues that might have been raised by any Modernist poem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     But it is here 
        that Bernstein’s reader is rewarded. In the hands of a lesser poet, such 
        questions would be answered with an image, symbol, or statement of reconciliation 
        (or perhaps nonreconciliation) introduced into the poem by the author, 
        or, at most, generated by a series of authorial devices which inherently 
        would exclude the reader from involement. I Bernstein’s poem, however, 
        the answers derive directly from the language and the reader’s commitment 
        to it. For the sensitive performer of the poem, I suggest, the “field” 
        of the poem’s beginning is gradually perceived to be not merely a field 
        to the edge of which the poet’s father has come to alleviate his “false” 
        or “faults,” to be not only a “canvas of truped up excuses” for the father’s 
        evasion of “the chain of connections,” but also to be a field through 
        which the reader must journey, a terrain o fpain and missed opportunities 
        through which the reader must search with the poet (and through the poet, 
        with his father) to bring meaning back into touch with purpose. If the 
        reader is successful in the linguisitc (re)construction, he eventually 
        comes to view the “field” or “plain” of the poem from a new perspective, 
        by the end of the poem, things are, indeed, “made plain,” as from the 
        windows of a “plane” the reader glimpses the “gleaming lights” which “waken 
        the passengers to the possibilities of the terrain” (p. 26), lights which 
        enlighten us to new ways of seeing and signify the potentiality of reuniting 
        that individual vision with society. Depending as they do on each of our 
        interpretations, upon the consciousness which each reader brings to the 
        poem, these new ways of seeing, these “possibilities” are “dreadfully 
        private”; not everything can be spoken. But, if wwe have floowed the flux 
        and reflux of the language, with the poet we share a breakthrough at poem’s 
        end, as the pain and isolation which the poem has recounted is transformed 
        into the “pane” of the “pleane” window, which “gives way, transparent, 
        / to a possibility of rectitude” (p. 27).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     It is this 
        “possibility of rectitude,” the potential for righting or correcting the 
        individual’s and society’s refusals to participate in the act of making 
        meaning which Bernstein offers in nearly all the poems of this collection. 
        The first poem of the book, in fact, focuses on that very problem. In 
        “Matters of Policy,” the reader is asked to participate with the poet 
        in an exploration of the failures and successes of contemporary American 
        culture, a culture that has assimilated and now presumes the great technological 
        advancements of this century, a society that, through “electricity” and 
        “Speed,” has seemingly been given more time for amusement and, thus, has 
        achieved a greater worldliness than any society in history. As the poet 
        somewhat cynically observes:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">                              
              ....Electricity hyperventilates even the</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In such a post-Mauberlian 
        world, guacamole may have cast out turkey (as “croissants” have replaced 
        “absinthe” [p. 1], but, along with the poet, what we most care about / 
        is another sip of....Pepsi-Cola” (p. 1). For, the benefits of change have 
        engendered not only extreme eclecticims, but an unsatiable desire for 
        change itself, as if it, too, were a consumer product; “Even nostaligia 
        has been used up” (p. 4). Our perspective has shifted from despair for 
        what we have lost to impatience for what the future is about to bring. 
        The “wasteland” has metamorphosed into “a broad plain in a universe of 
        / anterooms” (p. 1), into one boundless waiting place.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     But what is 
        most disturbing, Bernstein hings, is not <i>that</i> we wait, but <i>how</i> 
        we wait. There is a “spirit / of the place–a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> 
        that / lurks, like the miles of subway tunnels, electrical / conduits, 
        &amp; sewage ducts, far below the surface” (p. 3); there is a passive 
        acceptance of the future thatis of far greater import than the customs 
        and values we have surrendered. As we (like our reporters) “sit around 
        talking over Pelican Punch tea about the underlying issues” (p. 5), there 
        is a danger that we will fail to note our own demise, there is a possibility 
        that we may become the “<i>matters</i> of policy” – the subjects of a 
        course of action. Will we be determined by or will we determine our future 
        technology? The poet fears that, although there’s now “plenty of time,” 
        there are few ilndividuals “with enough integrity or intensity to / fill 
        it with the measure we’ve / begun to crave” (p. 7).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     Indirectly, 
        these are issues raised by John Ashbery’s early poem, “The Instruction 
        Manual,” a work which, at moments, Bernstein’s poem seems to parody in 
        its search for answers. Both poets seek to revitalize the technological 
        society in which they find themselves through the creative act of thinking/making 
        a new world out of language, and in pursuit jof that, both interweave 
        the technical language of the word-day world with more lyrical evocations 
        of exotic landscapes. But Ashbery’s dream-tour of Guadalajara, “City of 
        rose-colored flowers,” reappears in Bernstein’s poem as a farcical journey 
        to a</font></p>

        parasiacal scenes that reaffirm the imagination, Bernstein hallucinates

        relapse into the surrounding technological structures:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Similarly, Both 
        Ashbery and Bernstein look for a resolution between the languages of the 
        visionary and the technocrat in the venacular of the tourguide, who, if 
        unable to express the full meaning of such voyages, at least can summarize 
        events. And for Ashbery, in fact, this is the best we can hope for, a 
        kind of poetic jargon, half-way between the dreamer and the society in 
        which he lives:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">For Bernstein, however, 
        twenty five years later, there is an inherent ridiculousness in such a 
        compromise, and th epoet and reader are mildly mocked for believing in 
        such simplistic solutions:</font></p>

        (“Matters of Policy,” p. 8)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">For, while Ashbery’s 
        vision derives from a basic juxtapositioning of antithetical positions, 
        for an aesthetic of collage with roots in the Hegelian dialectic, Bernstein’s 
        oetics, with its traces of American Romanticism, functions in terms of 
        the simultaneity of object and experience. Any “answers” that “Matters 
        of Policy” proffers to the questions it has raised result from the synchronism 
        of reality–which I have expressed in my own poetry as the “seams in seems”–rather 
        than from accomodation. Everywhere in Bernstein’s poetry there is an immediate, 
        nonsymbolic simultaneousness of meaning. Language for Bernstein is both 
        creator and agent of ideation, and it is in the words as objects, accordinly, 
        that the potetial solutions of our culture’s dilemmas lie. Although, along 
        with the poet we may fear that our society is more interested in buying 
        and selling art than in creating or experiencing it (“our museums are 
        clogged with commerce”), there is a possibility that the museums can become 
        places of social intercourse (another meaning of “commerce”). The cause 
        of the constantly changing colors of the sky of which the poet writes 
        is probably pollution, but the shifts of the hour and the season can also 
        produce dazzilng changes of color. Although “hyperventilation” usually 
        results in a “black out,” an intake of extra oxygen can be temporarily 
        invigorating, and, as applied to medical technology such as breathing 
        apparatuses, it can save lives.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">     It is our capacity 
        to understand this simultaneity of things in and through language that 
        will determine whether, as individuals or a society, we can “fill” our 
        cravings. We must understand that the “measure” with which we fulfill 
        our desires is not simply a “capacity,” but also is both “a course of 
        action” (a “matter of policy”) and a “standard” by which our future can 
        be constructed. Like the poet, who, upon completing the voyage, takes 
        out his “harmonica” and “bang[s] out some scales,” we must create our 
        own “measure,” we must devise our own means of survival through the language, 
        music, rhythm, and beat of life. If we can accomplish such measures, like 
        the bongo player in the candy store with whom the poem closes, our meaning 
        will penetrate the silent inaction of the world around us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">      In nearly 
        all of the poems of <i>Controlling Interests. </i>Bernstein reveals his 
        desire for an fascination with the concomittance of the individual and 
        the world, of all language and experience. But simultaneity, as I suggested 
        earlier, functions in his work not merely in terms of meaning, but in 
        terms of nearly all the senses, in terms of the actual texture and sounds 
        of the words and sentences he uses. It is this texture, this entagled 
        density and richness of syntax, which is the meat of his poetry, but which, 
        in its very inpenetrability, is lost in any standardized reading. Yet, 
        it is this maze of seemingly superfluous matter that is the most important 
        aspect of his work; for it is in his “forensic bouts with the subterrean,” 
        as he puts it in the last poem of the book, that he “hears the way the 
        world hears,” permitting him to allow readers with radically different 
        experiences and sensibilities to draw simultaneously upon the poem for 
        their range of private associations and understandings. It is this attempt 
        to “portray a / version of that timeless time, ...that our nostalgia clings 
        to an our reason discounts” (“Island Life,” p. 77), I argue, that is Bernstein’s 
        most original contribution. For this reason I have described my couple 
        of readings as contextual, readings <i>with</i> the text, as opposed to 
        readings <i>of</i> the text. No one reading of a Bernstein poem could 
        ever be complete, and that is the wonder of each. My readings, thus, must 
        not be seen as “fixes” on these poems, but should be understood as one 
        reader’s attempts to bring his unspoken feelings about Bernstein’s writing 
        into touch with a more analytic critic. It is this kind of synchronism, 
        this act of making the mind whole, which Bernstein ultimately asks of 
        his readers and fellow poets in his poetry and criticism both. </font></p>
