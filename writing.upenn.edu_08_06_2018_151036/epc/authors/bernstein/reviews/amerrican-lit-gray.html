      <P align=justify>With this new collection, Charles Bernstein asserts himself 
        as one of the boldest poet-critics of his generation. A fearless opponent 
        of “Official Verse Culture,” Bernstein laments the “lobotomization” and 
        “suburbanization” of an American poetry that ignores the highs and lows 
        of culture, where the most innovative art resides (37, 39–40). What we 
        need, he argues, is a more “pro-vocative” poetry (106), a “PSL” (or “poetry 
        as a second language,” 50) that resists the easy epiphanies nurtured in 
        creative writing workshops and disseminated by the <I>Norton Anthology</I>, 
        the <I>New Yorker</I>, and PBS.</P>
      <P align=justify>Bernstein leads his attack on two fronts. As a poststructural 
        theorist he wants to “interrogate how language constitutes, rather than 
        simply reflects, social meaning and values” (4). As a L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E 
        poet he tries to hide behind a veil of words, much like Hawthorne’s minister, 
        to show that “whatever communication we can manage must be in terms of 
        our opacities and particularities, or resistances and impermeabilities—call 
        it our mutual translucency to each other” (32). Poetry thus becomes an 
        “ideolectical mode,” a process of thought, an investigation of how the 
        figurative world is produced rather than discovered.</P>
      <P align=justify>A gifted punster and mimic, Bernstein rekindles the subversive 
        quality that literary manifestos tend to lose after awhile. Accordingly, 
        Robert Creeley’s old rallying cry for the New American Poetry—“Form is 
        never more than an extension of content”—is updated to read, “Theory is 
        never more than an extension of practice” (ix), “Form is never more than 
        an extension of sound and syntax” (26), and, best of all, “Form is never 
        more than an extension of malcontent” (111). Similar witticisms arise 
        elsewhere. How does one get to Carnegie Hall? For Bernstein, the answer 
        to the well-worn joke is not “practice” but “theory” (7). To those in 
        the academy who would label him antiprofessional, <B>[End Page 663]</B> 
        he rejoins, “[Y]ou can’t go wrong if your attitude is bad from the start” 
        (48). Facing an imagined audience of middlebrow hecklers, he promises 
        to make their barrage of insults part of a stage act in his “own private 
        Borscht-Belt” (106). A poem entitled “Don’t Be So Sure (Don’t Be Saussure)” 
        is an ambiguous warning to all who would take him at his word.</P>
      <P align=justify>In the midst of this shtick, Bernstein gives some serious 
        consideration to alternative branches of modernist poetry. “Poetics of 
        the Americas” contains as nuanced an appraisal of postcolonial verse as 
        one will find anywhere. More successful still is “Reznikoff’s Nearness,” 
        a lengthy prose meditation whose title suggests not only the Objectivist 
        poet’s “adjacency” to his urban material (205–6) but his kinship with 
        those who seek to “move beyond a tortured and reductive conception of 
        [Jewish] identity” (233). In these and other essays Bernstein reminds 
        us that America is not so much a place as it is “an attitude toward language” 
        (225), an “image-nation” we construct in our imagination (136).</P>
      <P align=justify>An heir apparent to Stevens’s “Connoisseur of Chaos,” Bernstein 
        has emerged as postmodern poetry’s <I>sous</I>-chef of insouciance. <I>My 
        Life</I> is another of his rich concoctions, fortified with intellect 
        and seasoned with laughter.</P>
