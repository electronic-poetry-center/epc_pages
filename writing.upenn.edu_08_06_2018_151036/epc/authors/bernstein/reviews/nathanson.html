            business-style language with fractured phrases of a similar, but disassociated 
            nature. These phrases are intended to enable the reader to produce 
            their own meaning rather than consume the meaning created by the poet.

              isn't so much a narrative as the drastic prolepsis of one; it encapsulates 
              a life that it invites us to think of as both professional and personal, 
              and we might unfold any number of narratives out of it, each proceeding 
              in the terms this pair of sentences deploys. Rather than unpacking 
              this thumbnail sketch, though, Bernstein's strategy is instead to 
              double it, or more precisely to triple it. I quote the first of

            <P><font color="#000000">This reproduction, of course, brings out 
              sharply the reified quality and reifying function of this language, 
              directing our attention firmly away from the so-called content of 
              these individual portraits to the discursive practices that give 
              them their form as well as their meaning, producing the selves they 
              offer for our approval. For Bernstein as for many of the other Language 
              poets, narrative is simply the playing out of premises already latent 
              in the discourse that purveys it; its progress and closure naturalize 
              meaning-producing operations that ought to be foregrounded rather 
              than concealed. This pre-Bakhtinian equation of narrative with monologic 
              discourse and untroubled totalization is surely questionable; but 
              it helps account for the disenchantment with unimpeded narrative 
              in the work of Bernstein and the poets often associated with him. 
              Language poetry might indeed be regarded as a realization by more 
              drastic means of the dialogic project Mikhail Bakhtin assigns to 
              the novel; rapid collage, answer as more disconcerting strategies 
              of interruption, exhibit a multitude of received discourses and 
              dialogize their hegemonic claims. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">In Bernstein's work, however, the refraction 
              of collaged discourse tends to take place along more consistent 
              and predictable lines than it does in the novelistic practice Bakhtin 
              extols, in which a full range of heteroglossia competes for dominance 
              and thus displays what Bakhtin calls the socio-ideological contradictions 
              of the society in which they emerge. Such carnivalistic jostling 
              does sometimes occur in Bernstein's poetry. But for the most part, 
              in Controlling Interests, discursive practices are exhibited to 
              more schematic effect. The material surrounding the corporate bios 
              in "Standing Target" displays the book's characteristic strategy 
              sharply The verse paragraph I quoted is succeeded by the following: 
              </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">The end result was a gradual </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">neurosis superimposed upon a pre-existing 
              </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">borderline character structure. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">Note the exclusive right-side-up feature. 
              </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">(43) </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">The explosive quality of the last line depends 
              on its explicit release of a content also discernible in the material 
              that precedes it, here given hyperbolic form. The corporate bios, 
              too, function as commodification, while the shoot-from-the-hip diagnostic 
              language both standardizes deviance and implicitly mobilizes corrective 
              procedures. The percussive "Note the exclusive right-side-up feature" 
              thus lays bare an ideological machinery to which Bernstein's triple 
              portraiture has already drawn our attention--the human depth evoked 
              by the corporate blurbs, in which an individual complete with family 
              and hobbies does not simply lurk behind but implicitly pervades 
              and humanizes a corporate role, is peremptorily flattened by this 
              cheery brandishing of a commodity, and by the standardized language 
              that touts its standardized features. Bernstein's procedures foreground 
              this latter, linguistic commodification. As Controlling Interests 
              displays it, this version of the personal is itself a product, and 
              what produces it is a standardized, highly reproducible discourse. 
              </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">The critique of language practices that pervades 
              both Bernstein's poetry and his essays thus proceeds from Georg 
              Laukacs's classic discussion of commodity reification in History 
              and Class Consciousness. "The problem of commodities," Lukacs argues 
              there, "must not be considered in isolation or even regarded as 
              the central problem in economics, but as the central, structural 
              problem of capitalist society in all its aspects" (83). "In consequence 
              of the rationalization of the work-process," Lukacs suggests, "the 
              human qualities and idiosyncrasies of the worker appear increasingly 
              as mere sources of error when contrasted with these abstract special 
              laws functioning according to rational predictions" (89). For Bernstein 
              as for Lukacs, this critique is applicable to discursive practices: 
              "Clerks &amp; secretaries spend their time typing neatly, removing 
              idiosyncrasies from the language &amp; presiding over a tan neutrality--|unobtrusive'--with 
              the smoothness of flow allowed by explanatory transition" ("Three" 
              25). Ron Silliman's analysis in the influential essay "Disappearance 
              of the Word, Appearance of the World" is more sweeping, deploying 
              the notion of commodity reification to explain not only the standardization 
              of institutional discourses but also the project of what he calls 
              "realism" or unproblematic reference, the smooth movement from signifier 
              to signified that supposedly characterizes bourgeois discourse. 
              Standardized language, that is, presents itself as a seemingly neutral 
              or transparent medium, a kind of linguistic free market in which 
              objectified and supposedly objective messages are exchanged. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">Intervening in this putative marketplace 
              of ideas by foregrounding the coding operation itself, Language 
              poetry attempts to draw our attention to the way discursive practices 
              produce the reality they appear simply to convey. Often presenting 
              a more densely fragmented surface than the passages from Bernstein's 
              "Standing Target" I have quoted so far, Language poetry also works 
              to impede reference or smooth "projection." Whether it thereby makes 
              us conscious not only of the standardizing procedures at work in 
              language but also of their intractability, or instead offers us 
              an alternative to them, discovering another mode of linguistic functioning, 
              is a vexed point in several in-house discussions. Arguments often 
              turn on the homology between economic and linguistic production 
              I have been discussing, which is sometimes brandished with more 
              exuberance than caution.(1) I shall turn in a moment to these stretches 
              of what might be called pulverized language in Bernstein's poetry, 
              and to the competing readings of such extreme disruption that various 
              Language poets have offered. I want first to attend briefly to another 
              passage of less </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">violently condensed collage, from the long 
              "prose poem" "The Italian Border of the Alps"; like the passages 
              from "Standing Target," it seems more involved with exhibiting reified 
              language than with embodying a revolutionary alternative to it. 
              The passage is part of a longer movement that shares the focus of 
              the portions of "Standing Target" I quoted above: it fastens on 
              the discursive production of what we think of as individuality, 
              and on the compensatory role this notion plays. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">While the corporate language in "Standing 
              Target" gives this commodification of individuality rather obvious 
              form, this portion of "The Italian Border of the Alps" displays 
              a subtler but more pervasive standardization: </font>

            <P><font color="#000000">The production of the personal is by no means 
              the only focus here. This long passage is more heterogeneous than 
              many in Controlling Interests, more involved in that unfettered 
              collision of competing idioms and ideologies Bakhtin called carnivalization. 
              Bernstein's abrupt movement from discourse to discourse livens up 
              this excerpt by providing both giddy incongruity and the repeated 
              shock of recognition. Yet the pervasive though not quite monolithic 
              tendency to cliche here makes the passage progressively drearier, 
              the humor it provokes increasingly wan. By its end, the poem has 
              produced a sense not so much of carnival as of stupor mundi: our 
              attention comes to be occupied less with the competing claims of 
              each socially saturated discourse than with the already-spoken quality 
              of the whole, a feature that is global rather than local. "Not all 
              words for just anyone," Bakhtin suggests, "submit equally easily 
              to ... seizure and transformation into private property: many words 
              stubbornly resist, others remain alien, sound foreign in the mouth 
              of the one who appropriated them and who now speaks them ... it 
              is as if they put themselves in quotation marks against the will 
              of the speaker" (294). What for Bakhtin is true of some words in 
              some contexts comes in this passage from "The Italian Border of 
              the Alps" to feel true of all words all of the time: here utterance 
              takes on the uncanny air of citation. This reification is most likely 
              to strike us as wrenching when it produces assertions of individuality 
              as well as the subject committed to making them--"I believe in change 
              and I understand the impulse that makes you want to strike out against 
              regimentation." It is especially bleak when a desperate attempt 
              at individuation takes the form of what might better be called product 
              differentiation: "I like hard work and I don't care how long my 
              hours are. I have an inquisitive and analytical mind, make a good 
              appearance and get along well with others." </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">But another portion of this passage offers 
              a finally more disconcerting if less immediately heart-rending instance 
              of the reifying power of discourse: "Temporary inactivity, make 
              sure, no place, had been a receptive, in anticipation were allowed 
              at great lengths some material, &amp; after the dignitaries, shocked 
              by anything, social gathering through a maze of attics." This nervous 
              fragment offers a condensed, rather chilling demonstration of that 
              fading of person into discursive position which the whole passage 
              displays: here not only the sender but also the message fades from 
              view as predication disappears; what remains is a series of available 
              phrases from available codes. Whatever they mean to say, this fragment 
              implies, persons and predicates will say only this. Which is not 
              nothing: here speech-acts fade not into thin air but into discursive 
              practices and the ideologies they purvey "Ideology," Louis Althusser 
              suggests, "Interpellates Individuals as Subjects" (160). "You and 
              I," Althusser also notes in a mock-confidential tone which the content 
              of his pronouncement makes a little lurid, "are always already subjects, 
              and as such constantly practice the rituals of ideological recognition, 
              which guarantee for us that we are indeed concrete, individual, 
              distinguishable and (naturally) irreplaceable subjects" (161-62). 
              In Controlling Interests, brief, densely fragmented passages like 
              the one above tend to infect the slightly more extended and seemingly 
              individuated speech-acts that surround them: in this passage as 
              a whole there is less of a sense of people using language to say 
              what they mean than of discourse recruiting them to mean what it 
              says. What ought to be the expression of individuality is instead 
              the interpellation of subjects. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">In their critical writings, Bernstein and 
              other Language poets sometimes suggest that displaying these rituals 
              of ideological coherence is the crucial task of Language poetry; 
              a good deal more might be said about the subtle and frequently humorous 
              means by which Bernstein's poems pursue this critique. But I want 
              instead to turn to some more ambitious claims writers associated 
              with Language poetry have sometimes made about their work. These 
              claims concern the redemptive value of the poetry's disruptions 
              of discourse and syntax and center on what has often been called 
              the repossession of the word. I have especially in mind remarks 
              that appeared in the often-apocalyptic theoretical discourse that 
              accompanied Language writing in the seventies. While some of the 
              specific positions taken then have since been jettisoned, the vision 
              of linguistic reclamation outlined in these early manifestoes continues 
              to surface in recent, less overtly polemical justifications of Language 
              writing, notably in essays by Bernstein himself. We will turn briefly, 
              further on, to some of these recent pronouncements; but we can get 
              at the issues at stake in them by returning to the earlier polemics 
              in which claims for the repossession of the word were given their 
              sharpest form. I want to employ the tactic of appealing to an essay 
              that has since been extensively rewritten, Steve McCaffery's influential 
              "The Death of the Subject: The Implications of Counter-Communication 
              in Recent Language-Centered Writing." Published in 1977, the piece 
              appears in revised form, as "Diminished Reference and the Model 
              Reader," in McCaffery's 1986 collection North of Intention. While 
              the quotations I will marshal reflect positions from which McCaffery 
              has since distanced himself, their interest is not merely historical. 
              Cited repeatedly throughout the seventies and given considerable 
              critical attention in George Hartley's Textual Politics and the 
              Language Poets, the essay maps out positions that often resemble 
              those since articulated in such pieces as Bernstein's 1983 "Characterization," 
              his 1984 "Living Tissues/Dead Ideas," and his 1987 Artifice of Absorption. 
              (2) My argument, for which a close examination of some of the extreme 
              claims McCaffery makes in the 1977 piece can serve as a sort of 
              down payment, is that the utopian strain evident in Bernstein's 
              own recent essays offers a way of interpreting Language writing 
              that is both theoretically problematic and at odds with the textures 
              of the poems themselves. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">The kinds of claims I want to isolate are 
              most often provoked by passages of even more violently fractured 
              writing than those I have discussed so far. A section near the end 
              of "Standing Target," the poem with which I began, offers a stretch 
              of what might be called pulverized language. We can use it as a

            <P><font color="#000000">In "The Death of the Subject," McCaffery 
              suggests two different but supposedly equally liberating ways of 
              construing such extreme disjunction. We can, he argues, read what's 
              in front of us as the incomplete transcription of an utterance it 
              is our task to reconstructor, as he would have it, construct. But 
              we might instead teach ourselves to regard what's in front of us 
              as complete rather than fragmentary. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">In McCaffery's essay, these reading strategies 
              derive their appeal from the analogy between linguistic standardization 
              and commodity reification I mentioned earlier. The fascination these 
              visions of language compel, that is, involves the supposed political 
              implications of this verbal practice. If we regard passages like 
              this one as fragmentary transcriptions that require our participation 
              in order to attain completion, we supposedly become producers rather 
              than consumers of meaning: such writing, McCaffery suggests, "is 
              not... [a] textual commodity, replete with reference to be consumed 
              by |an understanding' reader. The demand is for praxis not consumption" 
              (71). We can thus supposedly escape the ideological presumptions 
              that pervade prepackaged and passively consumed discourse: "The 
              initial problem in readership here," McCaffery suggests, "is to 
              abandon all prejudicial perceptual sets and to consciously assist 
              oneself in producing one's own reading among the polysemous routes 
              that the text offers" (63). Bruce Andrews, who coedited the magazine 
              L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E with Bernstein, hazards a less cautious formulation: 
              "The constitutive rules of meaning are not taking the words away 
              from us. We can create those rules as we go along .... Obedience 
              to Authority vs. the improvisation of rules.... A carnival atmosphere, 
              therefore, ... workers' control... self-management." Taken as it 
              were off the linguistic market, generated by oneself and for oneself, 
              meaning would thus be produced for its use rather than its exchange 
              value, enjoyed rather than circulated, in a linguistic practice 
              no longer alienated or alienating. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">Accounting for much of the allure this linguistic 
              prospect possesses, the analogy between verbal and economic production 
              also lends it an air of plausibility But the vistas this analogy 
              opens may well be figmentary. I wonder whether what readers confronting 
              this text in fact experience is the liberating effect of being able 
              to produce rather than consume meaning. It is at any rate far from 
              obvious what it might mean to produce a reading of one's own here, 
              at least if that reading is to be neither determined by the linguistic 
              marketplace nor circulated there as something others might be prepared 
              to consume. "The whole idea of understanding," as Wittgenstein says 
              in a related context, "smells fishy here. I do not know whether 
              I am to say I understand it or don't understand it." He is responding 
              to the following intriguing proposition: "These deaf-mutes have 
              learned only a gesture-language, but each of them talks to himself 
              inwardly in a vocal language'" (Philosophical Investigations sec. 
              348). This parable is itself part of the so-called private language 
              argument, in which Wittgenstein undertakes to show, precisely, the 
              dependence of linguistic functioning on determinate public norms 
              or codes, on discursive practices or what he calls language games. 
              "Each of these readers sometimes construes according to prejudicial 
              perceptual sets or available discursive codes; but sometimes he 
              abandons them and instead assists himself in producing his own reading." 
              I do not know whether I am to say I understand it or don't understand 
              it. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">McCaffery's other reading paradigm is even 
              more radical, or at least more radically disconcerting: it attacks 
              not just the idea that reference is something already encoded which 
              we consume rather than produce, but the very notion of reference 
              itself. A text that so persistently makes referential projection 
              difficult, that is, might be conceived of as doing without it, as 
              simply, so to speak, being itself--"a signifier," as McCaffery's 
              solecism puts it, "without a signified and whose destination is 
              inward to the center of its own form" (75). McCaffery lends this 
              rupture and recentering implications that might be called apocalyptic:

            <P><font color="#000000">(68) </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">This is an old dream--archaic, we will see 
              in a moment, in more than one sense. Here again the embracing appeal 
              to an economic paradigm lends this assertion both its attractiveness 
              and its initial air of plausibility. "At its core," McCaffery argues, 
              "linguistic reference is a displacement of human relationships and 
              as such is fetishistic in the Marxian sense. Reference, like commodity, 
              has no connection with the physical property and material relations 
              of the word" (62). Reference and the communicative purposes it serves, 
              which constrain linguistic production, are like commodity exchange 
              and the reification it leads to: market or exchange value becomes 
              more real than the material reality of the thing itself; like reproduction, 
              representation hollows out material presence. This linguistic debacle 
              is supposedly avoidable. We know what it might mean to produce something 
              without having an eye to exchanging it; might not language also 
              be generated, so to speak, for itself, without the pervasive structure 
              of linguistic exchange affecting its production? But here too the 
              whole notion of understanding smells fishy, since it depends on 
              a conception of verbal immanence that turns out to be not quite 
              thinkable. "Language," McCaffery wants to argue, "enters the domain 
              of its own inwardness; the conventional centrifugality of signification 
              is reversed and the Sign turns inward through the absence of grammar 
              to pure, lexemic presence" (63): the word itself, the word as thing, 
              shines forth in all its autonomous splendor, detached from the codes 
              that allow us to exchange it only because they have already subjected 
              the word "itself" to mechanisms of exchangeability. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">But it is hard to imagine what "lexemic presence," 
              the word "itself" absent these structures of substitution, might 
              be. Even the pulverized passage from "Standing Target" is traversed 
              by the ghostly working of diacritical structures. Even if we think 
              of it as the complete transcription of an utterance aspiring to 
              expressive, nonreferential immediacy, rather than as the incomplete 
              record of an utterance we are to fill out, this pulverized passage 
              conveys a strong sense of the inescapability of the already spoken. 
              From the very beginning--"fatigue / of of"--these isolated words 
              seem to flit, whether in desperation or in weariness, among received 
              if not quite specifiable discourses and language games. This effect 
              is partly a function of the particular lexical content: bursts of 
              language that imply social or ethical imperatives--"must," "must 
              get"--recall the socializing, interpellating function of language 
              itself. But the sense that "lexemic presence" loses itself among 
              already extant structures derives as well from the foregrounding 
              of shifters--"they" "her"--and articles--"and the / The," or the 
              concluding, dangling "an"--which display the encoding function of 
              language; their predominance suggests an eerie priority of langue 
              to parole, of available structures to the content they process or 
              produce. This passage thus more strongly suggests the fading than 
              the realization of a dream of expressive potential or unmediated 
              linguistic presence. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">These radically truncated utterances, which 
              disrupt syntactic and semantic coherence, do feel like a resistance 
              to symbolic closure and ideological interpellation; we can read 
              this musicated passage as a determined effort to bring out the gestural, 
              rhythmic, or kinesthetic potentials of the word that symbolic language 
              occludes. But such expressive potential is disturbed in turn by 
              the recalcitrant and seemingly ineffaceable presence of symbolic 
              structures, codes that reshape this performance and expropriate 
              its gestures, alienating them in the very moment of their enunciation. 
              Reading this pulverized passage might better be analogized to consuming 
              these structures than to producing them; we read here the way they 
              consume and produce us. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">The terms of my discussion here are meant 
              to recall Julia Kristeva's. While Kristeva is rarely mentioned in 
              Bernstein's own essays, her notion of the necessary interpenetration 
              of the registers she calls the semiotic and the symbolic might provide 
              the most useful way of reading the passages of pulverized language 
              in Bernstein's work. Bernstein's poems repeatedly evoke a musicated 
              language, gravitating toward the semiotic and disrupting symbolic 
              coherence; they thereby resist the ideological interpellation that 
              symbolic closure sustains, exhibiting the often invisible violence 
              with which subjects are constructed and inserted in symbolic structures 
              and the practices that purvey them. Yet the poems never embody a 
              language exempt from these structures and the demands they mobilize. 
              </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">Kristeva suggests that this failure is necessary. 
              Her global terminology may present problems of its own; but it is 
              a useful antidote to the possible misuse of the analogy between 
              linguistic standardization and commodity reification we examined 
              earlier. Faced with the implicit suggestion that a language practice 
              no longer modeled on commodity reification might escape mediation 
              through a code, thus offering a model of unalienated subjectivity 
              with political as well as personal repercussions, it is indeed tempting 
              to argue that the intractability of linguistic structuring also 
              sets limits on what political liberation might mean. But it is safer 
              to suggest that linguistic practice, however revolutionary, will 
              itself offer neither the means to nor the realization of such apocalyptic 
              regeneration. </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">It is important to note that the messianic 
              pronouncements by Language poets that I have been resisting are 
              matched by a series of more limited and, I think, more tenable claims. 
              A vision of Language poetry as critique rather than apocalyptic 
              liberation, for example, dominates Ron Silliman's reading of Bernstein's 
              Controlling Interests. Bernstein's poetry, Silliman suggests, "restates 
              the constitution of the subject through ideology, insisting ... 
              that, at least by the practice of poetry ... one does not unravel, 
              go beyond, this knot" ("For Charles</font> <font color="#000000">Bernstein" 
              110). In a 1981 interview with Tom Beckett, Bernstein himself suggests 
              that his principal concern is to "[focus] attention on the constitutive 
              nature of conventions.... So that the poem itself becomes a machine 
              that spells and dispells [sic] illusion upon illusion, so that illusion's 
              engendering may be witnessed" (392). A remark in the 1981 "Socialist 
              Realism or Real Socialism" complements these formulations by taking 
              up a skeptical stance toward the notion of "expression," implicitly 
              identifying the task of poetry as the foregrounding of particular 
              mechanisms of alienation rather than the projection of a language 
              that would escape them: "The role of the individual isn't so much 
              expressing his or her individual self, but rather resisting various

              a better model for such resisting than emoting or expressing" (415). 
              </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">These declarations, however, are matched 
              in Bernstein's essays by arguments that approach McCaffery's in 
              their willingness to suggest that poetry may itself embody a no 
              longer alienated language and subjectivity. Bernstein has himself 
              attacked Saussurian linguistics on a number of occasions, often 
              along lines more like McCaffery's Bakhtin's. In a 1983 round-table 
              discussion later published under the title "Characterization," he 
              declares: "I disagree with the way language is characterized within 
              French structuralist thought from Saussure to Derrida, in which 
              language is thought to be divided in a polarity between the signifier 
              and the signified, as two different things, and that the relation 
              between the sound and the mental image is arbitrary" (442). </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">Bernstein's remarks on structuralism and 
              poststructuralism are sometimes hasty asides. But it turns out that 
              here Bernstein very much means what he says: meaning inheres in 
              sound, whose value is thus not merely differential but directly 
              expressive. "Sound," he argues in "Living Tissue/Dead Ideas," a 
              lecture delivered at Berkeley in 1984, </font>

            <P><font color="#000000">We are very close here to the vision of language 
              invoked by McCaffery and Andrews--of the word as positive lexemic 
              presence and present expressive event, liberated from the prior 
              diacritical codes that engender meaning only at the price of robbing 
              the word of its self-sufficiency and the speaker who deploys it 
              of his unalienated autonomy. A formulation Bernstein offers a bit 
              further on in "Living Tissue/Dead Ideas" gestures at just this sort 
              of expressive autonomy and originary integrity: "As against other 
              writing practices, poetry explicitly holds open the possibility 
              of producing, rather than reproducing, ideas. Beyond that, it may 
              make this production of ideas audible" (368). Bernstein thus sometimes 
              suggests that one value of Language poetry is its presentation of 
              what he calls utopian content.(4) "The promise of the return of 
              the world," he argues in the 1977 essay "Three or Four Things I 
              Know about Him," "can [be] (&amp; has always been) fulfilled by 
              poetry. Even before the process of class struggle is complete. Poetry, 
              centered on the condition of its wordness-words of a language not 
              out there but in here, language the place of our commonness--is 
              a momentary restoration of ourselves to ourselves" (29-30). </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">I'd like to suggest instead that one peculiar 
              value of Bernstein's poetry is its inability to present such content. 
              His poems do not embody a language that would escape symbolic constraint, 
              but instead register, in their straining against received discourse 
              and normative syntax, the desire for such apocalyptic liberation. 
              Unrealized and perhaps unrealizable, this desire may nonetheless 
              energize political practice. "We know," Walter Benjamin remarks 
              in the last of the enigmatic "Theses on the Philosophy of History," 
              </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">that the Jews were prohibited from investigating 
              the future. The Torah </font>

              however. This stripped </font>

            <P><font color="#000000">(264) This parable can be read as a counterpart 
              to the one revolving around Paul Klee's "Angelus Novus" earlier 
              in the "Theses": </font>
            <P><font color="#000000">This is how one pictures the angel of history.

            <P><font color="#000000">Benjamin's iconographic and rhetorical intensity 
              may seem like an odd match for the often laconic textures of Bernstein's 
              poetry. Yet I think a reading of Controlling Interests that managed 
              to keep both of Benjamin's antipodal fragments in mind would register 
              the terrors as well as the utopian aspirations mobilized by Bernstein's 
              work. These parables might preside, for example, over the regathering 
              of discursive wreckage that ends "Standing Target," succeeding the

              (3.) This passage weirdly echoes the doctrine of Elizabeth Peabody's 
              prize transcendentalist linguist, Charles Kraitsir, who influenced 
              Thoreau. See Kraitsir's Glossology. This is a peculiar lineage for 
              a broadly Marxist poet; Bernstein's studies at Harvard with Stanley 
              Cavell are a persistent and sometimes surprising influence. See 
              also Bernstein's 1987 Artifice of Absorption (8, 12-13, 32-33, and 
              36-37) for glossological assertions. <br>
