this form is the lena<br>
after my daughter<br>
here she is I will have to<br>
hold    on a minute tell you her line.<br>
<br>
a scribble<br>
the universe and planets holes and scribbles<br>
pure<br>
interruption she gets   her changing<br>
<br>
she is the only music she gives<br>
the intervals<br>
in which it is written.<br>
she is<br>
<br>
back she only wanted me to pick her up to say so.
