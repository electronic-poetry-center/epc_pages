<h3>Proposed Dissertation</h3>

Ralph Waldo Emerson and Fredrick Douglass; and lower-

Carlos Williams, Mina Loy, James Weldon Johnson,
Langston Hughes, and Louis Zukofsky; and the mind's talk
in Melvin Tolson, Jack Kerouac, Amiri Baraka, Charles
Olson, Hannah Weiner and David Antin to ascertain the
predominance of the talking subject in self-consciously
American poetics.</blockquote>
