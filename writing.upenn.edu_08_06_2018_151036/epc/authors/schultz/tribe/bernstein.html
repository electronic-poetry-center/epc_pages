<font size=4>The Influence of Kinship Patterns upon<bR>
Perception of an Ambiguous Stimulus<br>
</font>Charles Bernstein
<p><br>
What's money worth?  Not a whole lot if
<p>
You come up a few bits short & come
<p>
Away empty handed.  If that was the case
<p>
What would you have to say then?  At least
<p>
The motorperson knows how to blow a whistle.
<p>
At least in the winter it's not summer
<p>
(God damn mosquitoes & horseflies).  What did
<p>
The Mandela say to the Mandela?  BOY
<p>
HITS IGLOO.  Snowed motion, i.e., frosted or
<p>
Laminated.  To be such a bitter pill
<p>
& have nothing wrong.  <I>Don't laugh
<p>
It really hurted</I>.  If you put on
<p>
My shirt then what shirt am I
<p>
Going to wear?  The kind of people
<p>
Wear plaid Bermuda shorts.  The kind of
<p>
People that judge people who wear
<p>
Plaid Bermuda shorts.  The kind of
<p>
Day this has been (I think I am
<p>
Falling into a tunnel of love but
<p>
Forget to get on).  For a long time I'd
<p>
Say <I>twirl</I> when I meant 'spin'.  Have you
<p>
Heard the one about the fly & the
<p>
Paper?  The fly bottle could not found
<p>
The fly.  The Mother Bear could not
<p>
Find the rest of the story.  Harry has his
<p>
Troubles too but these are not interesting enough
<p>
To bear replay.  "That's a very
<p>
Suspicious-looking baby." "It's hard
<p>
Not to be a baby." "But
<p>
Are there really babies or just baby-
<p>
Behavior?" -For the purpose
<p>
Of your request I'm including this
<p>
Sentence about the influence of John
<p>
Ashbery.  While the packet
<p>
Boat sunk I can still imagine I am
<p>
Crawling into it; at the same time the ice
<p>
Is too thin to
<p>
Pretend to fall through.
<p>
<I>Meanwhile</I>, the water is wetter in the
<p>
Rich man's pond but doesn't taste
<p>
As good. -Hey wait a minute!
<p>
That's a bit <I>too</I> close, try to stay
<p>
Back <I>at least</I> 10 inches.  So what
<p>
If the margins don't
<p>
Turn out right?  Whadda you <I>mean</I> you're
<p>
Going to the next poem?  <I>This is the best
<p>
Part!</I>  Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood
<p>
You. -But nobody seems to want to hear
<p>
About the pain we men feel
<p>
Having our prerogatives questioned.
<p>
A bunch of darn-dash pragmatists
<p>
With justice on their side (for all
<p>
The good that will do them).  Don't
<p>
Frame me or I'll bust you in the
<p>
Doldrums. -Now let's
<p>
Switch the subject & try to find
<p>
Out what's on <I>your mind</I>.  Voyage of life
<p>
Getting you down?  Felt better when things
<p>
Were really rocky & now there's smooth
<p>
Sailing but it's lost its meaning?  I'm a
<p>
Good listener & only mildly demanding:
<p>
There's just the one-time fee (mostly
<p>
For paper & printing & distribution
<p>
Costs) & unlimited returns.  I'm bubbling over
<p>
With empathy & good advice & I'm not
<p>
Afraid to tell you where I think you've
<p>
Gone wrong.  Let's face it-
<p>
From the word go you've
<p>
Resented me-resented my being finished
<p>
In the face of your-what?-continuing
<p>
On? But I don't mean to be complete
<p>
If that makes you feel distant; still
<p>
As I say, I
<p>
Do want some distance.  She was a
<p>
Sort of Betsy Ross figure but without the
<p>
Accoutrements-no washer/dryer, just the one
<p>
TV. I said to her-What can you <I>expect</I>
<p>
From a poem?-evidently a lot less than
<p>
She did.  A poem bleeds
<p>
Metaphorically, just like I do.  I can
<p>
No more breathe than face
<p>
The music.  But if the first
<p>
Banana smells a rat look out for
<p>
Lost leader (tossed reader). -"I
<p>
Don't think I'm ever
<p>
Going home." -1 don't think
<p>
I've ever been home.  <I>We are looking for
<p>
Cheerful, enthusiastic self-starters
<p>
With solid backgrounds in detailed
<p>
Wails.</I>  The point
<p>
Not to change history but to change
<p>
Events.  For instance, you
<p>
Can change in the car, change on the
<p>
Beach, or use a changing room
<p>
At the beach.  Don't change me
<p>
& I won't change a hair on your
<p>
Chinny chin chin.  Or let me
<p>
Put it this way: You can call
<p>
Me anything you want to but give me
 <p>
The right change.  That's right: I
<p>
Haven't changed, you have.  It's
<p>
Not the time it's the beer.  I'm in
<p>
A rush, don't forget to send a
<p>
Check.  Not a con
<p>
just a dodge.  Not a dodge a Lincoln-
<p>
Mercury.  <I>Take me to your leader</I>.  Take me
<p>
To the 5 & Dime I've got to go.
<p>
Faith under leisure: as difficult as
<p>
Keeping a hat in a hurricane
<p>
Or an appointment with an erasure.
<p>
<I>One Mandela hit the other Mandela in the nose.</I>
<p>
What color blood came out?
<p>
R - E - D spells <I>red</I>.
<p>
Are you people?  You're about the nicest people
<p>
I know & I know some pretty unpleasant
<p>
Characters.
