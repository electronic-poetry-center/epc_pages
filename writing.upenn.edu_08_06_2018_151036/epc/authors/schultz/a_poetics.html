       Archibald MacLeish declared, "a poem should not mean
     but be," but of course he didn't mean it.  MacLeish's poems
     meant perhaps too much, and sang too little, to submit to
     his definition.  Marianne Moore wrote of a poet's ability to
     create imaginary gardens with real toads in them, and so to
     create being out of meaning.  More than any of the other
     moderns, Hart Crane self-consciously created poetry as
     MEDIUM and wanted language to spring us to somewhere beyond
     language.  This unmediated medium remained, however
     problematically, "natural"; the poem was an organism that
     grew on its own; it was the poet's truly born child.

       Crane incorporated advertising language into his myth
     in "The River" section of <i>The Bridge</i> as if pre-packaged
     language could also be used as a springboard to a
     non-linguistic realm.  But what happens when the order of
     transmission is reversed, when advertising copy coopts
     poetry, when the medium becomes the media, when the only
     poetry that most people encounter comes in the guise of
     slogans like "I wanna be like Mike" (which refers us to a
     basketball player and culture hero whose very style is
     "poetic")?  In this contemporary example, of course,
     advertising language is so strong that it has the ability to
     change the names by which we know our heroes--no one though
     of Michael Jordan as "Mike" until Gatorade (not,
     unfortunately, the company with the sight-rhyme, "Nike")
     needed to transform the hero to make him rhyme, make him
     even more friendly (is it possible?) to consumer culture.

       Marjorie Perloff's provocative claim in <i>Radical
     Artifice</i> is that advertising language is that of Modernist
     poetry; advertising's tenets were not laid down so much by
     Madison Avenue as by Ezra Pound.  "Exact treatment of the
     thing, accuracy of presentation, precise definition--these
     Poundian principles have now been transferred to the realm
     of copywriting" (94), she argues (and I wonder it we might
     not find more irony still in the word itself, "copy write";
     "copy right"; "copyright").  Perloff, ever an exact and able
     close-reader, takes the following billboard message in hand
     to show that, "as the 'look' of the standard poem begins to
     be replicated on the billboard or the greeting card, an
     interesting exchange begins to occur" (100):
<P>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><PRE>               O. R. LUMPKIN. BODY-

                  TY.    WE TAKE THE DENT
                  OUT OF ACCIDENT.</PRE></tt></blockquote>
     "Surely," she enjoins, pointing to the lineation of this
     "free verse" bit of advertising, with its clever wordplay
     and enjambment, "the next time we have an accident, this
     memorable punning will stick in our minds and draw us to O.
     R. Lumpkin rather than some other body shop" (100).  This
     "standard poem" might well be printed in <i>The New Yorker</i> or
     <i>Poetry</i> or <i>American Poetry Review</i> (the latter with a
     photo of Mr. Lumpkin himself, no doubt).  The punning
     begins, of course, with Mr. Lumpkin, who takes our lumps and
     makes them right again.

       Advertising's power, of course, lies in its simulation
     of authenticity; the potential consumer may know that the
     American Express card ads that show the familial love
     between father and daughter are "artificial," and still wipe
     tears from her eyes.  Hence Dan Quayle's insistence that
     television should show us a more authentic version of
     ourselves.  And so authenticity becomes a form of nostalgia.
     Crucial to this sense of authenticity, Perloff would claim,
     is its presentation--as in the Lumpkin ad--through the
     medium of free verse, which we think of as "natural" and
     unmediated through the artifice of traditional forms.  "Free
     verse = freedom; open form = open mind, open heart: for
     almost half a century," writes Perloff, "these equations
     have been accepted as axiomatic, the corollary of what has
     come to be called, with respect to poetic language, the
     'natural look.'"  I suspect that she means us to hear the
     conflation of poetic language with hairstyle, and the
     attendant confusion between image and "self," whatever that
     is; Perloff's persistent attacks on the univocal lyric over
     the past ten years or so are based on a profound distrust of
     the "self" created through it.  She writes: "Most
     contemporary writing that currently passes by the name of
     'poetry' belongs in this category which [Jed] Rasula wittily
     calls PSI, for 'Poetry Systems Incorporated, a subsidiary to
     data management systems.'  The business of this particular
     corporation is to produce the specialty item known as 'the
     self,' and it is readily available in popular magazines and
     at chain bookstores" (19).  Need one add that there is a
     magazine of that name: <i>Self</i>? 
<P><font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2"

<LI>
</font>

       While Modernists worked from a dualist model that set
     in tension "the image and the real," and believed that one
     was related to the other, Postmodernists, according to
     Perloff, see that relationship replaced by one "between the
     word and the image" or between "the simulacrum and its
     other" (92).  In this new poetry, the image itself is
     deconstructed, because after all, who can trust advertising
     to tell us the truth about ourselves, whoever those selves
     are?  If advertising has become our mirror, then the poet's
     goal is to distort that mirror in such a way that we see the
     inherent distortion in images--reflection must give way to
     refraction, deflection. 
<P><font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2"
color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>

       So we abandon the Imagist image and return to language,
     but language understood in a new way, not as mediator but as
     medium (in  the material, not the psychic, sense).  Where
     the modern imagist free verse poet would write the Lumpkin
     ad as it appears above (and as the ads flash by in Crane's
     "the River"), the postmodernist poet would  begin not from
     the image of a wreck, and the message that the wreck would
     be fixed, but from the words used to convey that
     message--whose real import is mercantile.  For the language
     of advertising, above all, sells.  The postmodernist poet
     might play on the name O. R. Lumpkin, its relation to lumps
     and kin and lumpenproletariat, and in so doing, unmessage
     the  message by making the medium the subject.  It bears
     quoting the three  ways in which Perloff sees Postmodern
     poets deconstructing the image:
             <P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><!--_extract--><P>(1) the image, in
all its concretion and
          specificity, continues to be foregrounded, but it
          is now presented as inherently deceptive, as that
          which must be bracketed, parodied, and submitted
          to scrutiny. . . .     
             <P>(2) the Image as referring to something in
          external reality is replaced by the word as Image,
          but concern with morphology and the visualization
          of the word's constituent parts: this is the mode
          of Concrete Poetry[.]
             <P>(3) Image as the dominant gives way to syntax: in
          Poundian terms, the turn is from phanopoeia to
          logopoiea.  "Making strange" now occurs at the level of
          phrasal and sentence structure rather than at the level
          of the image cluster so that poetic language cannot be
          absorbed into the discourse of the
media. . . . <!--_/extract--></tt></blockquote><P

       The real strength of Perloff's book is in the narrative
     it elaborates  as a way to understand the NEED for Language
     poetry in a now unfolding literary history.  Thus, "[i]f
     American poets today are unlikely to write passionate love
     poems or odes to skylarks or to the Pacific Ocean, it is not
     because people don't fall in love or go birdwatching or
     because the view of the Pacific from, say, Big Sur doesn't
     continue to be breathtaking, but because the electronic
     network that governs communication provides us with the
     sense that others--too many others--are feeling the same
     way" (202-3).  In other words, poems about great vistas can
     already be found--either in the <i>Norton Anthology</i> (see
     Keats) or, in their fallen form, in a Hallmark shop.  This
     passage, which expresses Perloff's yearning for a unique and
     unsullied perspective on (past) nature, sounds to my ear
     transcendentalist in its idealistic paranoia, its yearning
     for, yes, authenticity.  Perloff's defense, like Whitman's,
     would be to celebrate self-contradiction, knowing that
     nothing else is possible.  Like her allies the Language
     poets, Perloff would claim with Gertrude Stein that
     repetition is actually insistence, and that to sound the
     transcendentalist note in the 1990s is to say something
     new.  Yet it's hard for her to do this without somehow
     worshipping the unsullied and autochthonous "self" that she
     so easily dismisses in rear-guard free verse poetry.

       Charles Bernstein and Ron Silliman and other of the
     Language group of poet-critics agree with Perloff on this--
     as on most--points; our particular way of seeing such a
     vista has been pre-determined, so the argument goes,
     precisely by the Norton (at best) and by Hallmark (at
     worst) or by the more likely (con)fusion of the two.  This
     way of seeing insures that we do conform with others, also
     programmed to buy Hallmark cards and do other good deeds for
     capitalism; the only way to be a good Emersonian these days
     is to de-form the language, which is also to reform it.  As
     Bernstein says it (he, too, sounding a lot like someone who
     has found the original Waldo amid a crowd of faces):
     "<!--_%--><I>Poetry is aversion of conformity</I><!--_/%--> in
the pursuit of new
     forms, or can be" (1); and "I care most about poetry that
     disrupts business as usual, including literary business: I
     care most for poetry as dissent, including formal dissent;
     poetry that makes sounds possible to be heard that are not
     otherwise articulated" (2).  These claims are not, in and of
     themselves, radical.  The Language poets' means of acting on
     these claims ARE more radical, but their attempt to create
     once against a language that has not been coopted by the
     media, an un-transparency that is transparent, puts them
     squarely in the line of American idealists that includes
     Emerson and Gertrude Stein.  Their quest for originality, a
     writing free of all quotation, is at once as admirable and
     quixotic as was Emerson's.

       Bernstein is perhaps the most intelligent and most
     consistently interesting of contemporary thinkers on poetry
     and poetics; he is also the most self-contradictory.  His
     work bears the kind of confused (nay, panicked) attention
     that Emerson's does; like Perloff, his argument against the
     Romantic and Modernist image owes perhaps too much to the
     first American Romantic.  He is at once aesthete (he adores
     Swinburne and Wilde) and proto-Marxist; purveyor of
     <!--_%--><I>claritas</I><!--_/%--> and
<!--_%--><I>obscuritas</I><!--_/%-->; deconstructionist and
     fetishist of the word; preacher and skeptic; fiction-writer
     and disseminator of truths--the train could go on, derailing
     itself as it goes.  This is, of course, part of Bernstein's
     world view; his is a vision that tries to leave the binary
     behind (by containing multitudes), and engage in the
     polymorphous multiplicity of things.  Yet I wonder if many
     of these contradictions are not, in fact, incompatible;
     Bernstein's Swinburnian poems seem somehow at odds with the
     needs of a leftist politics, for example.  Yet Bernstein's
     prose is, for the most part, clear; he would pass a
     university course in argumentative writing.  It is far
     clearer than his poetry, and serves (ironically) to
     advertise the poetry by explaining its purpose, if not its
     content.  In fact, the content of the poems seems to me to
     be the elaboration of the  prose, as if poetry were a "proof
     text," rather than the proper subject of our so-called
     science.

      Bernstein's claims for poetry are in many ways even
     stronger than Perloff's, although he begins from the same
     starting blocks with (an all-too-easy?) attack on
     advertising culture, arguing that poets should display
          <P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><!--_extract-->a willingness to engage in
guerrilla warfare with the
          official images of the world that are being shoved down
          our throats like so many tablespoons of Pepto Bismol,
          short respite from the gas and the diarrhea that are
          the surest signs that harsh and uncontainable reality
          hasn't  vanished but has only been removed from public
          discussion.<!--_/extract--></tt></blockquote>  <P

     Bernstein replaces Perloff's creators of false "selves" with
     the purveyors of what he calls "official verse culture."
     That these are the purveyors of a political, as well as a
     poetic, message Bernstein makes clear in his argument that
     the notion that "we can 'all' speak to one another in the
     universal voice of history" is a "disease."  His heroes,
     then, are poets who work "in opposition to the dominant
     strains of American culture" (6).     
<P><font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2"
color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>

      These dominant strains, for Bernstein as for Perloff,
     are evidenced in the strains of the American lyre.  But
     where Perloff's poetic heroes are those who replace "form"
     with "artifice"--who replace sonnets with numerically
     generated bits of language that have the virtues of
     formalism without any of the taint (and what a taint there
     is!), Bernstein erases the differences between all forms of
     writing:
          <P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><!--_extract-->if there's a temptation to
read the long
          essay-in-verse ("Artifice of Absorption"), which
          follows these opening notes, as prose, I hope
          there will be an equally strong temptation to read
          the succeeding prose as if it were
poetry.<!--_/extract--></tt></blockquote>  <P
Align="right"><!--_attribution-->(3)<!--_/attribution-->
<P>
     Whether prose or poetry, his writing is meant to be taken as
     fiction; in a Steinian way he writes, "when <i>Content's
     Dream</i> was published I wanted that to be classified as
     'essays/fiction.'  People sometimes ask me if I'm interested
     in writing a novel.  I say, well, I did, that's it" (151). 
<P><font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2"

<LI>
</font>

      While Bernstein persuades me that the categories by
     which we write and read literature no longer do us much
     good, it seem to me that he himself holds to these
     categories, and needs to hold to them to make his argument
     fly.  I find "Artifice of Absorption" the most compelling
     piece in <i>A Poetics</i>--Bernstein's verse "Essay on Poetry,"
     as it were.  For here is an essay-poem that contains the
     virtues of the essay form (it is readable, cogent) and of
     the poem (it relies on enjambment for its rhythm and drama--
     the same kinds of enjambments, I might add, that make poets
     such as Amy Clampitt such easy targets for critics such as
     Perloff).  Bernstein begins from the question that springs
     "naturally" from his work as a poet-critic (or poet-poet or
     critic-critic); in so doing, he refines Perloff's discussion
     of "artifice":
          <P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><!--_extract-->A <!--_%--><I>poetic
reading</I><!--_/%--> can be given to any piece of
          writing; a "poem" may be understood as writing
          specifically designed to absorb, or inflate with,
          proactive--rather than reactive--styles of
          reading.  "Artifice" is a measure of a poem's
          intractability to being read as the sum of its
          devices & subject matters.<!--_/extract--></tt></blockquote>
<P Align="right"><!--_attribution-->(9)<!--_/attribution-->
<P>
     For Bernstein, artifice is not so much a new kind of form,
     as it is for Perloff, as a way of writing that foregrounds
     technical devices over and above "content" and "meaning."
     To paraphrase Bernstein's discussion of "voice" in the
     <i>Language Book</i>, "content" is but one possibility for
     poetry.  But "content" and "meaning" are not the ends of
     poetry, just more means; they are not the same thing,
     either, for "content never equals meaning" (10).  Artifice
     is, according to Bernstein's jargon, non-absorptive; one
     cannot "get lost" in a Language poem the way one can get
     lost in a Harlequin romance--but the reader is also not in
     danger of losing her soul to the particular demands made on
     it by the Harlequin (which are fundamentally conservative,
     despite--or because of--the soft porn).  And, as Bernstein
     sees it,
          <P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><!--_extract-->much contemporary

          poetry is based on simplistic<br>
          notions of absorption through unity, such<br>

          (who as his work shows<br>
          knows better, but who has made an ideological<br>
          commitment to such

      Bernstein places himself characteristically at both
     ends of his artificial dualism:
          <P><BLOCKQUOTE><tt><!--poetry-->In my poems, I<br>
          frequently use opaque &amp; nonabsorbable<br>
          elements, digressions &amp;<br>

          arsenal to create a more powerful<br>
          ("souped-up")<br>
          absorption than possible with traditional,<br>
          &amp; blander, absorptive
techniques.<!--_/poetry--></tt></blockquote> <P

<P>
     He acknowledges that "[t]his is a / precarious road" that
     makes the reader more conscious of technique than of
     experience, but I wonder if Bernstein believes in the
     currency of terms like "experience."  After reading
     Bernstein's work over an extended period, the world of
     language becomes THE world, always threatening/promising to
     dissolve into a chaos of no-definition.  Finally, though,
     Bernstein proposes a kind of reading that is rather
     pragmatically critical, even as it is creative.  As Perloff
     points out toward the beginning of <i>Radical Artifice</i> (and
     this is one of its least interesting moments), "Not only
     does the boundary between 'verse' and 'prose' break down but
     also the boundary between 'creator' and 'critic'" (17). 
<P><font face="Humanist, GillSans, Ariel, Helvetica" size="-2"
color="#996699">
<LI>
</font>

      Like Stein's language, Bernstein's is always
     "foreign"--alien, confusing, and above all, never sacred.
     Bernstein's most recent book of poems, <i>Rough Trades</i>, must
     be read in this way, as a celebration and cerebration of
     language in and for itself, and as an exercise in
     non-absorptiveness that is meant to refashion prevailing
     world political views.  In the contradiction between these
     two purposes lies an abyss; Bernstein seems at times too
     much like a New Critic who attempts to change the world by
     ignoring it.  But Bernstein, however much he seems to be the
     Pope (Alexander, that is) of the postmodern, means to
     undress us of our layers of expression in order that our
     means of expression can clothe us in new (and utopian)
     possibilities.  He and Perloff, in their complementary
     assaults on the common-places of the American language at
     this fin-de-siecle, provoke us to look past the image by way
     of the (small-w) word, and to re-invest our words with
     whatever ideals we have left.  The poetry that they
     advertise is not written in a "common" language, but in one
     that we cannot yet think in, non-absorptive to the point of
     being non-sensical.  It <!--_%--><I>may</I><!--_/%--> get us to
another world.  But
     then again, that's a soap opera.
