      <br />
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't remember seeing it any other way but whole, a big<br />
round rock wheeling about the heavens and comin' on green to<br />
crack sidewalks,  gentle and undemanding, as if I saw it first,<br />
approaching it from somewhere  else.</p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything about it always seemed right. The roundness is<br />
      right. The way it spins.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to wonder why you couldn't break every speed  record<br />
  just by going straight up and somehow hang up there awhile,<br />
  while the  world spun around beneath you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose you dug a tunnel all the way to China and then<br />
  jumped into the hole. You'd fall down through the center, and<br />
  then  fall up &#8211; almost to the other side. Then you'd fall back <br />
  down again, up again,  down again, each time losing a little distance,<br />
till finally you'd be hanging  there, exactly in the middle &#8211; the only<br />
place in the world where every way is  up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody said it's way too hot in there and nobody could<br />
  possibly do it. Others thought I'd shoot out way up over China<br />
and then fall  back and miss the hole ('cause the world would<br />
turn a little in the  meantime) and just end up killing my damn <br />
fool self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I liked the part at the very end, when you're falling  only <br />
  50 feet or so, through and back and through again, like a very <br />
  slow kind  of floating quiver or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could bounce on it, later, or even walk around on it<br />
(in it, through it). You keep going <em>through </em>it all the time. Like<br />
those dolls with weighted bottoms only you don't  ever have a <br />
table top to end up right side up on. A weird bouncy sort of<br />
spin  thing you couldn't ever get out of. You could try, but <br />
you'd never make it:  3,959 miles straight up in all directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the colors are right. We say it's mostly green and blue, <br />
  but other  animals see it differently than that and when you <br />
  get up high enough it all  gets black, so maybe it's just our eyes<br />
that make the colors right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of land and water is right &#8211; a very good thing<br />
in a spinning  ball. If too much weight were on one side it'd <br />
shake itself to pieces, or get  into some wacky eccentric extra
        <br />
        orbit kind thing &#8211; worse and worse till finally it all breaks <br />
        loose from the Sun's pull and wings  on out into nowhere, <br />
        crashing into planets and suns and generally causing all  kinds <br />
        of unimaginable hassles and disasters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is  the land and water balanced right, the shapes <br />
  are very beautiful. The two big  land-shapes are strikingly<br />
similar, for example, and right. They both have  narrow places <br />
near the middle &#8211;  the right place to be narrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is right, clear down to the smallest parts of  it.<br />
I know a beach that's made up entirely of little round stones<br />
the size of a  pea or smaller. All smooth and round little pieces<br />
of jade, jasper, agate,  moonstones, glass from broken bottles,<br />
shells, tiny pieces of wood &#8211;
and you  get so hung up in a few<br />
  square yards you just can't stop collecting and hunting  and<br />
  looking into it and suddenly there's an unbelievably tiny little <br />
  pure white  claw of a crab and <em>on that</em> is something even smaller,<br />
  crawling!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even smaller than that, it's right. You can spend your<br />
  whole life looking through microscopes at subworlds living off <br />
  further  subworlds, just as surely as looking through a telescope<br />
  at light years and  light years of worlds so far away they aren't <br />
  even there anymore &#8211; nothing's  there except this little blip of <br />
  light that finally travelled far enough to hit  your human eyeball <br />
  and live, thereby. The whole thing finally coming together  as <br />
  Rexroth said: . . . &quot;like looking at a drop of ink and suddenly<br />
  finding  you're looking at the Milky Way.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or John Muir waking in a Sierra meadow, in spring, and<br />
  finding, inches from his waking eye, a wildflower he, and nobody<br />
  else, had ever  seen. Rising, he found himself in a field of delicate<br />
  color so complicated he  spent the whole day in only ten square<br />
feet
  of it, classifying and drawing  pictures of hundreds of little <br />
  plants for the first time in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An average of a ton of insects for every acre of a field like<br />
that.  Deer-hoof crushing a flower. Rodents at the roots of it. <br />
Birds diving and  pecking at it. Big trees crowding it out with <br />
their shade. Mushrooms in the  warm fall rains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridges rising into  mountains and air too thin and not much<br />
  dirt for it. Shy little Coneys nibbling  at tiny moss. Snow and <br />
  Glaciers and the peaks at last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal snow where  no matter how far up it is you can bet <br />
  your life some man, sometime, stood, and  looked, and wept <br />
  again for wonder of this Human eye!</p>
