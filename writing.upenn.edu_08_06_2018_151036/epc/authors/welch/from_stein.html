      <p class="body_justified"> Much of her writing is, in a way significantly different  from other literature, a demonstration of an abstraction (generalization) which  has been derived from her analysis of literature, and she often uses the methods  of literature to make the same points which critics make by means of  expositionary writing. It is convenient, therefore, to begin with the critic's  discussion of language, before investigating Stein's &quot;demonstration&quot;  of the same point.

      not sufficient.  Literature does contain thought, while&nbsp;emotional 
      language is by no means  confined to literature . . . the ideal scientific language is purely  &quot;denotative&quot;: it&nbsp;      aims at a one-to-one correspondence between sign 
      and  referent. The sign is completely arbitrary, hence 
      can be replaced by equivalent  signs. The sign is also 
      transparent; that is, without drawing attention to  itself, 
      it directs us unequivocally to its referent.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> . . .whatever the mixed modes apparent upon an examination        of concrete literary  works of art, the distinction between the literary use and the scientific use  seems clear: literary        language is far more deeply involved in the historical structure of the  language; it stresses the awareness of the sign itself. . . .

    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p class="body_justified">This  distinction is useful although, like any generalization about literature, it  becomes difficult to apply at times. It is, for instance, not easy to maintain  that the words of W. C. Williams, Wallace Stevens, or other &quot;imagist&quot;  poets draw attention to themselves as signs. But like most generalizations, it  is useful insofar as it gives us a way to discuss a phenomenon that undoubtedly  contributes to our enjoyment of many, perhaps most, specific poems and  individual poets.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> It is  certainly sensible to suppose that the writer of literature is more acutely  aware of language than are most of his readers, whether he wishes his finished  work of art to draw attention to its signs, or to the images to which those  signs refer. Gertrude Stein has taken this position but instead of making the  above kind of statement, has written a book entitled <em>How to Write</em> in which she  attempts to force one into an acute awareness of sign. She does not teach one &quot;how to write,&quot; but attempts to give one  an experience with language that will enable one to write.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> She does  this by a treatise on language, sentence structure, and grammar which is  presented almost exclusively by means of example. She includes only enough  &quot;exposition&quot; to assure one that her point is the teaching of the  elements of English, and uses the title to show the reader that her lesson and  the way in which it is being &quot;taught&quot; has to do with the writing of  literature. Her statements of &quot;exposition&quot; usually look like this:  &quot;here is a sentence&quot; or &quot;think in articles&quot; or  &quot;successions of words are so agreeable it is about this.&quot; But perhaps  her most explicit statement is: &quot;It is impossible to avoid meaning and if  there is meaning and it says what it does there is grammar.&quot; (<span class="detail_italic">How To Write <span class="detail">71</span></span>)</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> But how is it possible for meaning to &quot;do&quot; with the result that  there is grammar? An example is this sentence: &quot;Grammar makes her name  trout and love birds.&quot; It is possible to read the sentence to mean that  her name is trout, but if one does this the phrase &quot;and love birds&quot;  demands that one consciously change &quot;name&quot; from a noun to a verb.  This sentence does not always elicit this response; I have tested it upon  several people, about half of whom responded in the above way, and half just  stared. The following sentence usually succeeds in making one conscious of  syntax: &quot;A seated pigeon turned makes sculpture.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> She uses many such tricks with words, always to the end of making one  conscious of the fact that the reader is enforcing the syntax upon each  sentence, that syntax is not the obvious and passive thing that one had perhaps  supposed.</p>

    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p class="body_justified">It is  interesting to notice that she makes one aware of the sign &quot;and&quot; by  making it into a noun. Perhaps being conscious of &quot;and&quot; is not very  important, but it seems to me that she had to do it this way because of all  parts of speech articles and conjunctions have the least obvious referent, and  at the same time are very rarely noticed as signs. It is, for example, very  difficult to think of &quot;pigeon&quot; as a sign, for one always tends to see  the bird. But once having been made aware of articles in the above way, the  step to thinking in a like manner of all words is a short one.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> It is  also interesting to notice that although of course articles are not  &quot;predetermined and trimmed,&quot; by saying this she turns &quot;predetermined&quot;  and &quot;trimmed&quot; into signs and at the same time one is entertained. The  entertainment value of such verbal playfulness is extremely important in a work  such as this, for unending examples of sentences could  easily become terribly tedious.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I have  tried it on many of my acquaintances, merely by giving them the book without  comment, and have noticed that they usually become quickly absorbed and find it  necessary to read aloud sentences such as these from the first pages:  &quot;Painting now after its great moment must come back to be a minor  art&quot; and &quot;When a dog is no longer a lap dog there is a temporary  inattention.&quot; The first of these sentences, and perhaps the second as  well, may have seemed interesting because of their content, but I hardly think  that this is true of a sentence from the third page, which was read aloud to me  by all of those who continued reading this far: &quot;Apart disposed deposed  that he went.&quot; This too was popular: &quot;It was joined and generally  resembled when it is and belongs to all which they rent.&quot;</p>
    <p class="body_justified"> We might compare a passage from a systematic presentation  of this subject with a passage from <em>How to Write</em>, judging the two both for their  ability to hold one's attention, and for their ability to make their point. I  quote from <em>English Grammar, </em>selected  and prepared by the editorial staff, United States Armed Forces Institute, page  47 &#8212; not a definitive work, but one which attempts to be very simple and very  clear.<br />

      it takes  the implications of this way of looking at language to greater lengths than I  have indicated, but I will discuss these extensions later when I analyze <em>Tender Buttons. How to Write </em>makes  one aware of words as signs by means of heaping together a great many &quot;referentless&quot;  sentences and phrases with the result of gradually reducing the importance of  the referent, and gradually increasing the importance of the sign. It also  forces one into a consciousness of the formal structure of the sentence, by  including groups of words which are not sentences among ones that are, and by  repeatedly reminding one of sentences by using the word &quot;sentence,&quot;  until one feels a conscious relief and sense of solidness when a balanced  sentence appears.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Although  she has achieved &quot;opacity&quot; of sign by destroying the referent, I do  not think that a sign's drawing attention to itself necessarily means that it  will do so at the expense of the referent. I am certain that Wellek and Warren  do not mean to imply this in the general statement with which I opened.  Actually, I think that the contrary conclusion would more nearly follow, since  being aware of the sign only means that one is consciously aware of a correspondence  of two things, whereas before he might only have been aware
        of the one &#8212; the referent. And when Stein herself desires to use language  as a means to a referent, she very successfully achieves a one-to-one  relationship between sign and referent and at the same time draws attention to  the sign itself.<br />

    <td colspan="2"><p class="body_justified">The highly specialized, but very  clear, use of &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;classified&quot; is a good  illustration.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> However,  if one does become in the habit of noticing the sign, and I think that every  student of literature arrives at this kind of awareness, it also becomes  possible to read only on the level of sign, or at least with very little  concern for the referent. Recently a friend of mine delighted herself, and an  entire group of word-conscious ones, with the sentence: &quot;There is, then,  no unanimity of sundials.&quot; The phrase &quot;unanimity of sundials&quot;  not only elicited an immediate joyful response, but also became a phrase that  could be mumbled to oneself with pleasure. Most of us have also known the  pleasure of repeating lines from, poetry until they become only a chain of  words. We do not exactly remove the meaning entirely, nor listen to them only  as sounds, we simply enjoy them verbally. I think that the sentence from Stein  that I have already quoted is an example of this sort of thing: &quot;They are  found and able and edible. And so they are predetermined and trimmed.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> This is  certainly not the end of a study of literature, but it is a common by-product  of a serious and intensive study, and is perhaps a more important by-product  than we usually admit. I would even go so far as to take the position that  without having had the experience of recognizing language in this way, and of  finding delight in the recognition, one is seriously hampered in the study of  literature, whether he puts his study to use as a critic, an author, or simply  as a reader. For if one of the characteristics of literature is that it tends  to draw attention to its signs, and I think that this is undeniable, then being  conscious of this is a very important part of the sensibility of reader,  critic, and writer. It is not enough simply to be &quot;told&quot; to watch for  this characteristic, one must have had the experience of
        noticing it, and of finding delight in the noticing.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> A statement like Wellek and Warren's is valuable to the  reader who has already had the experience, but is meaningless to those who have  not. Wellek and Warren can show the experienced reader that he should be even  more aware of this sort of thing than he has been, and their distinction  between &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;referent&quot; might, as it has for me,  offer a way to explain why certain writing is the way it is. These are the  functions of systematic writing, and must not be undervalued, but neither  should we undervalue the importance of Stein's way of making the point. It will  be Stein's method that produces more conscious readers; it will be Wellek and  Warren's method that provides a more coherent way of talking about that which  one has read.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I have  admitted that almost every student of literature has had this experience with  language, then why is Stein's book necessary or useful? Why not gain this  experience simply by reading literature in general? The answer is that Stein  accomplishes the job, entertainingly, in slightly less than four hundred pages,  thereby forcing one into a greater realization of implications, a more  intensified awareness, than one would be apt to gain if he left it to chance  and time.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> But what  are the implications of this experience aside from those I have mentioned? They  can best be discussed, I think, by using examples of Stein's writing, for she  has experimented in this area more than has anyone with whom I am familiar.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> As I  have said, if you become hyper-conscious of language as sign, it becomes  possible to read on this level almost to the exclusion of content. Usually we  do not go very far with this, but at times, as with unusually obscure poetry,  it is more or less forced upon us. I, for instance, read Eliot&rsquo;s <em>The Waste Land</em> so many  times that I almost memorized it, but for nearly a year I had no idea what was  going on in it. Now that I have a general notion of what Eliot is trying to do,  I still read the poem more or less as I did in the beginning because his  &quot;meaning&quot; simply does not interest me. His poem does.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> It seems  most sensible to explain my past and present fascination [with <em>The Waste Land</em>] by saying that the  &quot;mechanism&quot; of the poem holds my attention, and did so even though  the content was not clear to me &#8212; that is, that I was enjoying the poem on the  kind of verbal level I have been describing. And I do not mean that the words  are being read as nonsense syllables. I have said this to many people who are  convinced that such a thing is impossible, since words do have meanings and  since they cannot conceive of the possibility of separating the two. And when I  say that they are not
        exactly separate, they have no idea what I mean.</p>
    <p class="body_justified"> But I  know that this is possible, and I know what I mean, because I know that I have  done it with certain of Stein's books which operate only on this level. The  best of these is <em>Tender Buttons. </em>The  following passage in entitled &quot;Cranberries&quot; but actually you should  just think of &quot;Cranberries&quot; as being its name.

It seems better to say that I had difficulty making the  referents of the words add up to a coherent &quot;total referent.&quot; There  is no such complication in <em>Tender Buttons. </em>Here you  have to read to a more extreme degree in the same way that I read <em>The Waste Land </em>before I  could figure out its &quot;total referent.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> This  &quot;explanation&quot; of <em>Tender Buttons </em>is an  example of the astonishingly simple explanations that are usually the answer to  Stein's writing. The first impression is usually the right one in this case:  &quot;Why, these are only words.&quot; But it is possible to arrive at very  interesting things if one is willing to look at words as words and as words in  combinations. I realize that this sounds terribly esoteric and sterile, but it  really is not. In this chapter I shall continue to show the general  applications of the experience to be gained from <em>How to Write</em>,  and will leave the closer analysis of <em>Tender Buttons </em>to a later chapter.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I shall  assume that I have made clear what I mean by reading on a verbal level, for  actually if you read even the short passage from <em>Tender Buttons </em>and the extracts from <em>How to Write </em>and read  them just for what they are, it will be obvious that this is what I mean. But I  am sure that I must show what a recognition of this sort of thing can lead to  before it will cease to seem nothing more than a pointless game. It is a game  all right, but it is not at all pointless.</p>
    <p class="body_justified"> It is apparent that the basic thing about <em>How to Write </em>and <em>Tender Buttons </em>is that  in these works Stein objectifies words, thus implying that she is insisting  upon their intrinsic value. The next step from this, if you are a writer, will  be the insistence upon the intrinsic value of a poem &#8212; a group of words  artfully arranged. Here again one might expect that such a writer will be more  interested in what a poem is &#8212; as a form, as an object &#8212; than in what that poem  can convey.<br />

    <td colspan="2"><p class="body_justified">This is  the position that Stein has taken as the result of a very common line of  argument. If it is true, as it seems to be, that a paraphrase of the &quot;meaning&quot;  of a poem is usually ordinary, usually something that anyone could have said,  then perhaps the &quot;poem,&quot; in its essence, is not what is said, but is  the manner of the saying. We can ponder this forever and never get further than  the above formulation, for it is quite obvious that words do have meanings, and  that all of the poetry that we have read takes advantage of this fact. It is  therefore impossible ever to demonstrate, wholly to one's satisfaction, the  point at which the meaning ceases to function and the &quot;mechanism&quot;  begins.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> But the  artist can be obstinate. He can set about to build a poem that is only &quot;of  the essence of its going&quot; in order to demonstrate the lengths to which  this argument can go. The academician cannot do this, for he can only formulate  from the poetry that has been made. It is perfectly obvious that if no one had  made a poem, there would
        be no concept of  &quot;poetry&quot; that begs a formulated definition.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> <em>Tender Buttons </em>puts us again in the  position of him who saw the first object that elicited the response: &quot;that  is a poem.&quot; For if <em>Tender  Buttons </em>elicits the response, &quot;That is a poem, or is at least  disarmingly like other poetry,&quot; then we must call it a poem and attempt to  discover what it has in common with other poetry. That is, we must if we are  academicians, for that is our job. The artist need only present us with the  object that he has built.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> In this particular discussion I make no distinction between prose and  poetry, but call &quot;poetry&quot; any writing written with artful intent or  which gives the impression that it is artful. I define poetry as we usually  have to admit that we define it, as that which elicits the response,  &quot;That is a poem.&quot; The fact that there is a great concordance of  opinion as to which pieces of writing are poetry and which are not, is what I  shall rely on in order to assume that what I am talking about will be  understandable to my readers, or at least communicable.</p>
    <p class="body_justified"> Stein,  then, has written in <em>Tender  Buttons </em>a group of poems which are intended to be only &quot;of the  essence of the going&quot; of poetry. To her, this essence is a matter of  interrelationship of parts, with the &quot;movement&quot; of those parts, the  rhythm, being the most important effect of the interrelationship.<br />

      <p class="body_justified"> It is &quot;still happening&quot; today, in the painting that is called  &quot;non-objective&quot; and which is only now beginning to have very much of  an audience. But the activity in painting that is based upon this idea has become  less and less, for it really is &quot;not any longer very interesting&quot; to  the artist. I will go into this in Chapter III. But there are still a great  many people who have not experienced these paintings, and there are a great  many more who have seen them but who are unable to refrain from putting objects  and stories into them. Just as
        with <em>Tender Buttons </em>the idea basic to &quot;non-objective&quot;  painting is not realized by the vast majority of its audience. The paintings  are still annoying, at times irritating, and to some stimulating; to Gertrude  Stein this means that they ought to be &quot;interesting&quot; to their potential  audience.</p>
    <p class="body_justified"> The cubist painting of Gertrude Stein's day bears a close relationship to  the writing in <em>Tender  Buttons. </em>The cubist painter demands that his painting be looked at  as a painting, as a demonstration of the idea &quot;painting,&quot; not as a  demonstration of what ideas a painting can convey. What must be looked at is  the formal analysis of the objects in the painting &#8212; not the objects as  objects, but the formal analysis that has gone into their making &#8212; and the relationships  of form to form, color to color, and line to line, within the bounds of the  frame. I say &quot;within the bounds of the frame,&quot; for the fact that Juan  Gris, for instance, painted hundreds of still lifes all of which have the same  objects in them, vase, guitar, pipe, newspaper, should indicate that after all  these objects cannot be important. That is, they are not important as they  relate to real objects, but they are important as objects within the frame &#8212;  painted objects. They exist only in relation to themselves.<br />

This gets us back to the objects in the paintings, or  the &quot;subject matter.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> We can  put into the terminology I have been using elsewhere in this discussion, the  kind of treatment of objects that is to be found in cubist painting. A painted  vase can be a sign with a one-to-one relationship to its referent, a ceramic  vase, or the painted vase can be a sign that only draws attention to itself.  The vase in a
        cubist  painting tends to be an &quot;opaque&quot; sign, which means that the painter  is insisting upon the right that his paintings be looked upon as paintings, and  the objects within the painting simply as objects in a painting  &#8212; signs.</p>
    <p class="body_justified"> Gertrude Stein speaks about the painter's way of looking at the subject  matter of his art in a way that might well be applied to the subject matter of  her writing. I am using &quot;subject matter&quot; to mean what the writing  talks about, and what objects are painted, without considering to what end they  are talked about or painted.<br />

An oil painting is an oil  painting, and these things are only the way the only way an oil painter makes  an oil painting.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p class="body_justified">Analogies  between arts can easily be pushed too far, but this relationship is especially  appropriate since Stein was so very interested in twentieth-century painting.  She writes in <em>Picasso</em>: &quot;I was alone at this time (1909) in understanding  him, perhaps because I was expressing the same thing in literature . . .&quot;  (<span class="detail_italic">Picasso</span> <span class="detail">16</span>).</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> For some time this sentence seemed only cryptic to me, but I now see  that, as usual, Stein meant what she said in the most literal possible way. I  have spent a good deal of time looking at and thinking about the paintings of  this century and have talked to a great many painters who are struggling, more  or less successfully, with the general ideas expressed above. As I began to  know this painting and as I came to know Stein's writing, the relationship I  have described became clear to me. The determining factor of the relationship  is to be found in their similar ways of analyzing their arc, and in the fact  that both Stein's writing and cubist painting are essentially analytic &#8212; that  is, the finished products are analytic.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> The  analytic procedure upon which both arts are based can be briefly described as  one which insists upon the validity of a painting as a painting, a poem as a  poem, almost as if they were being
    regarded as objects like any man-made object &#8212; like a clock for instance.  The painting and writing of past centuries are analyzed to see what makes each  work, and what makes each be what it is. Then an example of the conclusions  thus derived &#8212; which will be abstract &#8212; is made into an object which is offered  for the considerations of others. You might say that it is only different from  any other man-made object &#8212; a clock &#8212; because a conscious intelligence has  attempted to make it be a very interesting object, a complex object, a pleasing  object, a beautiful object. The process is not quite so cold-blooded and so  &quot;conscious&quot; as it appears in this brief abstraction. In Chapters II  and III, I shall go more deeply into the factors which are not fully  &quot;understood&quot; by the artist, while he is creating. However, the above  is essentially correct as I understand it, with the analytic process being an  historically determined &quot;way of seeing&quot; of which the artist is more  or less conscious.<br />

    <td colspan="2"><p class="body_justified">And so  it is with <em>Tender Buttons </em>and with  much of the writing of this century. The interesting thing is that the critics  of today, in general, have this attitude but are prevented from stating it  flatly because of a concern for &quot;historical perspective.&quot; The artist  is able to flatly say that he is of the twentieth century and sees things in a  certain way, but the academician must attempt to be able to see past art as it  was seen when it was made.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Even so the critics of the past day &#8212; Wellek and Warren are good examples  &#8212; repeatedly insist that to experience poetry you should look at the poem, not  asking to what use it can be put, or what kind of a man wrote it, until after  you have first seen what it is. It seems sensible to say that critics are  influenced by their century's &quot;way of seeing&quot; just as the artist is,  and that the growing acceptance of this position is due to temporal factors.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Questions  of genre [and related matters of critical study] become unimportant when one is  faced by writing like Stein's, by painting like Picasso's and Gris', by writing  like Williams' and Stevens', because it is so obvious that one is being faced  by something  that is so undeniably an object, and so undeniably artful, that all one can do  is ask: &quot;What is it?&quot; The tendency is not to give it a name (novel,  poem, portrait) but to attempt to describe it as it is. The fascinating thing  is that when one asks these questions, when one describes in this way, one is  quickly led to very basic theoretical questions: &quot;What has it to do with  art in general?&quot; &quot;What is painting?&quot; &quot;What is poetry?&quot;</p>
    <p class="body_justified"> It is  important to realize that we of this century do tend to look at art in this  way. We should admit it, and we should admit that one of the reasons for the  tendency is that the artists of the century have demanded that we look at their  art for what it &quot;is.&quot; Stein demands this more insistently than does  anyone else. From reading even a very small amount of her work we learn the  importance of relaxing all standards until the experience of the work has been  realized. We also learn that this can be done even if we have a large  erudition, some very settled habits, and remembered responses. We learn it  because we are forced to do it. It has always been true that we derive theories  of art from experiences we have had with art. From Stein's &quot;difficult&quot;  writing, and it is difficult to learn to be simple enough to accept the fact  that she means what she says, and that she says it as simply as it can be said,  from Stein's difficult writing, then, we can learn to depersonalize ourselves  when we look at a work of art, so that the experience is not at once related to  or rejected by other experiences, but is an additional experience that  realigns, perhaps, our earlier perspective. It is from the experience that we  derive the theory; and the experience to be gained from <em>How to Write</em> and <em>Tender Buttons</em> is one that  leads to very exciting things, and is one that can only be gained, in an  intense way so that you &quot;know yourself knowing it,&quot; from Gertrude  Stein.</p></td>
