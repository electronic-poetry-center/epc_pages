        I lived here  nearly 5 years before I could<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet the middle western day with anything approaching <br />
        Dignity. It's a place that lets you<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand why the Bible is the way it is: <br />
      Proud people  cannot live here.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The land's too flat. Ugly sullen and big it <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pounds men  down past humbleness. They <br />
        Stoop at 35 possibly cringing from the heavy and  <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrible sky. In country like this there<br />
        Can be no God but Jahweh.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the mills and refineries of its south side Chicago  <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passes its natural gas in flames<br />
        Bouncing like bunsens from stacks a hundred feet high. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  stench stabs at your eyeballs.<br />
        The whole  sky green and yellow backdrop for the skeleton <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steel of a bombed-out town.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Remember  the movies in grammar school? The goggled men <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        doing strong things in<br />
        Showers of steel-spark? The dark screen cracking light <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  the furnace door opening with a<br />
        Blast of orange like a sunset? Or an orange?</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was photographed by a fairy, thrilled as a girl, or <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a  Nazi who wished there were people<br />
        Behind that door (hence the remote beauty), but Sievers, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose old man  spent most of his life in there, <br />
        Remembers a &quot;nigger in a red T-shirt  pissing into the <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;black sand.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">        It was 5  years until I could afford to recognize the ferocity. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends helped me. Then I  put some<br />
        Love into my house. Finally I found some quiet lakes <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a  farm where they let me shoot pheasant.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Standing in the boat one night I watched the lake go  absolutely <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        flat.&nbsp;Smaller than raindrops, and only<br />
        Here and there, the feeding rings of fish were visible a  hundred yards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away &#8211; and the Blue Gill caught that afternoon<br />
        Lifted from its northern lake like a tropical! Jewel at  its ear <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belly gold so bright you'd swear he had a<br />
        Light in there. His color faded with his life. A small<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green fish . . .</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> All things considered, it's a gentle and undemanding  <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planet, even here. Far gentler<br />
        Here than any of a dozen other places. The trouble is <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always and only  with what we build on top of it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There's nobody else to blame. You can't fix it and you <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't make it go  away. It does no good appealing <br />
        To some ill-invented Thunderer<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooding above some  unimaginable crag . . .</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It's ours. Right down  to the last small hinge it<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all depends for its existence <br />
        Only and utterly upon our  sufferance.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Driving back I saw Chicago rising in its gases and I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew  again that never will the<br />
        Man be made to stand against this pitiless, unparalleled  <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monstrocity. It<br />
        Snuffles on the beach of its Great Lake like a <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind,  red, rhinoceros.<br />
        It's already running us down.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You can't fix it. You  can't make it go away.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what you're going to do about it, <br />
        But I know  what I'm going to do about it. I'm just <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going to walk away from it. Maybe<br />
        A small part of it will die if I'm not around</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feeding it anymore.</font></p>
