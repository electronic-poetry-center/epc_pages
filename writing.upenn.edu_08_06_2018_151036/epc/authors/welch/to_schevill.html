      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified">PRESS RELEASE</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Poet Lew Welch,  one of the major figures of the new San Francisco Renaissance, appears for The  Poetry Center of San Francisco State College on Wednesday, October 26, at The Museum of Art, Van Ness and  McAllister Sts., at 8:15 p.m.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Widely published  both here and in Europe, Welch is known for the wide range of  &quot;voices&quot; in his work, and for a down-to-earth style he sometimes  calls &quot;letting America speak for itself.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified">        His many  readings have been among those that reshaped the idea of Poetry Reading into  its modern form &nbsp;&mdash; a new theater art far  more flexible, challenging, and entertaining than what we had in the past.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Welch will perform his  poems, songs, and plays in a program called &quot;One-Man Plays.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified">        PROGRAM NOTE</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> I first read for  the Poetry Center in 1959. I said, in the program note: &quot;When I write my  only concern is accuracy. I try to write accurately from the poise of mind  which lets us see that things are exactly what they seem. I never worry about  beauty, if it is accurate there is always beauty. I never worry about form, if  it is accurate there is always form.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified">        I phoned that  statement from work. I had a dreary, underpaid job for the Bemis Bag factory,  and the roar of their presses and bag machinery was almost too loud to think,  or talk over.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Since 1959 all kinds of  things have happened to me and the world, but I still hold to this statement,  absolutely.</span>      </p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> What was then  the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; is now down to a few survivors, each of whom  went his only way. Most of us are gone (as so many makers go early) into  prisons, loony bins, penthouses, graves, and the other silences of whatever  desperation.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> It has been no  different for us than for any generation. Witness Rexroth's poem on the death  of Dylan Thomas, where he lists the victims he loved, who lost. Then counter  this, or any other, with the list of poets, painters, dancers, musicians who  lived beyond their fortieth year.</span>      </p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Happily, I'm  still alive and am just turned 40. From such a rare height it is possible to  say (in defense of my work, and others here or gone), that today, foolish as  they may appear to the frightened eye, young America swings much harder than we  did, with less fear, and more love.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> American poetry,  for at least 54 years, has had to  screech above the din of a Bemis Bag, Hart Crane's daddy wanted him to manage  the family candy factory. Whitman could say it was marvelous to see the muscled  workers. But the poets who followed him (who had to be those workers, at jobs)  know that there ain't no muscled workers, they's only victims.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Whitman, the  roaming spectator, was victimized later. Fancy professors do it, daily, in the  state universities. There's a Walt Whitman Savings and Loan in his old home  town. It only goes to show what the reward is, if you work real hard and never  cheat.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> The sound we hear from our tribe is not much  different from the thousand sparrows who used to sleep in a palm tree outside  my window, once. The racket was unbelievable, but the birds were only arguing  about who has the right to sleep, and where.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> So, in my  poetry, I've tried to keep the din while being accurate to the poise of mind  that lets us know what's what. Sometimes I've called this din &quot;Letting America`speak for itself.&quot; Often  it's a depressing job.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> But I still have  faith that if I do this right, accurately, the sound will emerge a  &quot;meaningless din of joy.&quot; Because I know that the true sound of  living things, a carrot or a tribe, is meaningless, and that we, watching it,  feel joy.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> This sound, the  din of joy, is quite distinct from the sound of the Pentagon, Washington in  general and especially Mr. Johnson, the fear-ridden hateful spites of J.  Edgar Hoover, and the killing orders of anyone who wants to &quot;boss&quot;  anything whether or not the work ought to be done.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Therefore, &quot;One-Man  Plays,&quot; some of the din of the Tribe, speaking for itself. Accurately.
