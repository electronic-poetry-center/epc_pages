When I taught one semester at College of Marin I had to fill out a form which  had, among others, a question which went &quot;have you ever suffered from  undue worry or fear?&quot; They also made me promise I wouldn't burn flags,  politicians, draft cards, or money.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> I also enclose a  ticket to a major public reading to be held on June 30, as per the ticket. I'd  be very pleased if you and your friends could come to hear us. The cause is  righteous. Further, you might want to see, in action, what kind of nut you have  hired.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> I  can't tell you how delighted I am to join your school. Until, hopefully, June  30th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lew Welch</span></p>

      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> The nature and usage of  American English will be studied with especial emphasis on daily speech, the  source language we use on our streets and in our homes. The best writing has  always been written in this living tongue, it has never come from libraries  dictionaries, grammar books and the like, for these last are long after the  fact. While examples from great American writers will be studied, the art of  listening to contemporary speech and then using it will be the heart of the  course. Call it ear training.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Grammar and  usage will be looked at in the modern manner of structural linguistics &nbsp;&mdash; a lively new approach to the real problem of  verbal communication, not just a bunch of rules. The history of our language  will be studied to show how languages constantly change in uncontrollable,  almost organic, ways.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Creative writing  is seen as the art of transforming thoughts and observations into words.  Poetry, Plays, Novels, Songs, Essays, all will be called &quot;Writing.&quot;  The student is encouraged to find his own range of writing, he will not be  bogged down by arguments about genre, style, existing forms, rules and so  forth. You cannot analyze writing until that kind of writing has been written.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> Frequent field  trips will be taken into the City's parks, bus stations, and streets, where the  students will practice observing as writers do, and listening as writers  listen. From these notes and visions will come the stuff of written exercises. <em><br clear="all" />

      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"><em>The Instructor</em><br />
        Lew  Welch is one of the strongest of the poets identified with the &quot;Beat Generation&quot;  of the early 1950s. His popularity has spanned 2 generations at least, and he  now speaks both to the new generation of young, active students, and to the  older academic world of liberal scholars and professors.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> He has published 4 books and appears in countless  journals of the avant-garde &quot;little magazine&quot; world. In spring of  1970 his first major collection, <em>Ring of  Bone, Poems 1950 to 1970</em> will appear from Grove Press. He  appears in many textbooks and anthologies of modern verse here and in Britain,  and has been translated into Italian and Spanish.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> He is noted for powerful performances of his work,  standing high among those who have recently established the art of Poetry  Reading as perhaps the most exciting verbal theater in America today.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> A graduate of Reed College in 1950, he studied more than 3  years in the graduate school of the University of Chicago, majoring in  structural linguistics, philosophy, and history.</span></p>
      <p><span class="body_justified"><span class="body_justified"> He teaches the Poetry Workshop for the University of  California Extension, a position he has held for 5 years, and is the frequent  guest lecturer and visiting Poet at special university programs all over the  United States and Canada.</span></span><br />
