      Bixby Canyon,<br />
      July 1962</p>
      <p> <span class="body_justified">Dear Robert,&nbsp;&nbsp; It is odd that I  should want to write this letter to you, since I know so many of us better, who  I respect as much. But at this moment my spirit, what's left of it, needing to  speak, can only speak to you.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I must speak to one who has gone through something as black as this, and  who made it somehow  &mdash; or at least is still there, operating his Human Being (your  phrase) decently, as a poet.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I have reached what I hope is nearly the end of 5 months of a total withdrawal  of all love, all spirit, all hope, all vision  &mdash; my whole being drawn into a fist  pounding bitterly against Everything, for it has seemed that Everything is  dedicated only to mocking MAWKING all that I know is good, and  here. I cannot shut out the din anymore. I am afraid,</p>
      <p class="body_justified"><br />
      The  other night I miss-heard on television a fat trained fake&shy;virile voice boom:</p>
      <p class="body_justified">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . OUTNUMBERED, AFRAID, AND UNCORRUPTIBLE</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I don't know what was actually said, but now I use  this as my letterhead (the couplet was not intended, I am not giving this  letter, always, the care I give to my Writing  &mdash; where I always hear the<br />
        music just before I find the  words that sing it)</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I will not list the details of my personal  troubles, it's the usual list of details.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> For it all goes down, now, right to the bottom. All action, all movement,  sur-real scenes in an accurate movie &mdash; the cashier in the supermart, the  dialogue in the bedroom, all true &quot;literally and in all senses&quot; . . .  and it's important to remark that the &quot;literal,&quot; the &quot;stubborn  fact&quot; of it is vividly there for me, as I'm sure it will always be.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> For though I am mad, I am mad in the way Poet is always, must be, mad. It  is the difference (as Jung put it to Joyce, trying to convince him that his  daughter was in grave danger, and Jimmie said &quot;Nonsense, what you describe  is what I do all the time. It is even a game we play together.&quot;) And Jung  answered, &quot;Yes, Jimmie, but you <em>dive </em>to the bottom of the river. She is <em>sinking</em>.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified">        The poet can never sink and, while sunk, be Poet. His diving is always a  dive, even if to do it he must sniff the vapors in his oracular cave &mdash; or  otherwise drastically wrench himself open that the <em>whole river </em>flow through. (Which is what is wrong with Jung's  phrase &mdash; he makes it sound a little prim: as if one could learn to mount the  board, properly suited, spring a few times, and do the trick cleanly whenever  one wills.)</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> And so I have not sunk. And the sickness I've been through had nothing to  do with the bottom of any river. It was the worse thing: the deliberate <em>closing</em>  of myself.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> And I found that whatever it is that chooses to flow through me is so  powerful it will destroy me if I resist it <em>in any way</em>. That I must open to it  or die. And the death will be a suicide.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I opened to it 2 days ago, here, at Ferlinghetti's Big Sur cabin, after  being alone for 5 days. It wasn't a clean opening. It was a pulse. A timid  thing, like that way a trout lies still and timidly works his gills a while  when you land one and then return him to the water.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> ,And I got the most radiant vision of openness. I saw how this was all  meaning. That I was only a mess of gates. That having Human Being is to have  many many gates, that it <em>all</em> all flow through.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> That it  was all right, too, that we have a Self. That it <em>all</em> be transformed. Different  on the way out.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> And all  of this was so powerful my penis came erect, with no sex to it, and, as the old  saying goes &quot;putting your prick through the 
        window, and fucking the world&quot; with helpless  love!</p>
      <p class="body_justified">What is this? Some black satori?</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> For I  cannot stay open to it. It hurts too much. But what is it that hurts?</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I have dropped all devices. I cannot even drink wine anymore. All last  night my dreams were horrible nightmares: my mother and I and my best friend  (who kept shifting, being all friends, and who I called my brother) left a  movie and walked through a deserted, poor, neighborhood trying to reach our  car. We started past a school and I said, &quot;Not that way, it's  horrible&quot; for the playground was full of darting, dangerous, figures and  there was a ghastly refuse-heap that smelled of carrion. So we walked another  way and came past another schoolyard, this one full of &quot;monkey bars&quot;  and slides and swings. Hundreds of vicious youths of both sexes were sitting on  them. They spotted us and yelled &quot;There go 3 of them!&quot; and attacked  us. I tried to reach the car but, seeing it was hopeless, stopped and picked up  a wine bottle. I broke the bottle, making it into a weapon &mdash; jagged glass with  the neck a stout handle. (The bottle was an empty half &mdash; gallon of Tivola &mdash; a  good choice.) The largest, most vicious of them made a similar weapon (the  street was full of empty bottles). I glanced at the others. My  &quot;brother&quot; was lost in a swarm of them. My mother was handing them her  purse, begging mercy. It was like being set upon by a troop of baboons . . .</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I woke up and said, &quot;Well, those are only thoughts. They may have  come from something real, but now they are only thoughts. I can take  them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified">        And I deliberately went back into the dream, over and over again (for  that is something I have trained myself to do, seeing it as one of the skills  of Poet). I met that viciousness over and over again, trying this way, and then  that way &mdash; nothing worked.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I then woke fully, and began to weep. I have been weeping ever since. I  cannot stop! (the grammar of that last sentence is not pity, but astonishment)  I cannot <em>stop</em> ! (astonishment and despair)</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I am  struck by what is meant [by] &quot;crying in the wilderness.&quot;  </p>
      <p class="body_justified">&quot;Literally and in all senses&quot; how wise Rimbaud was! (and that the <em>literally</em> part is what is most befogged &mdash; till we write down and down and down,  as I have, almost getting to a plainness that obviates all poetry. Fighting the  baboons again. As if to shatter that &quot;more truth than poetry&quot; vicious  saying of all our vulgarity! And still to get ((from <em>Wobbly Rock</em>))!!!! the cry  &quot;I don't understand it.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Why don't you write so that  everybody can understand it.?&quot;</p>

      <p class="body_justified"> My God!!!</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> After the  radiant vision of openness (which it will take me books to bring into words,  for I thought at the time &quot;no poetry, do not stop the flow of it (snagged  in flight) but let it go through you&quot; &mdash; and, incidently, realized that  that is what's wrong with wrong writing: it stops us, whereas Poetry means only  &quot;this is <em>flight</em>!!!! This is the open flow of it!!!&quot;)</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> After the  radiant vision of openness, yesterday, I saw myself a ring of bone in a clear  stream, and vowed never, ever, to close myself again.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> But can I do  it? Will it always hurt this much? What is it that hurts?</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Shall I close myself a  little while? Today? (I am eyeing the wine bottle again. I pour myself a cup of  wine. I will rest.)</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Will closing rest me?</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> What is it that hurts? What is it that needs resting?</p>
