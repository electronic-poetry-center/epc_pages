      <em>Preface</em><br />
      <p class="body_justified">Since 1965 I have been teaching a class for the University of  California Extension called Poetry Workshop 819. There is no credit for the  course and it is open to all. This year, 1970, my course was dropped for  budgetary reasons, and I miss teaching it so badly I decided to write a written form of the  course. I say &quot;write a written form of the course&quot; because the course  itself could never be transcribed since its nature is oral and dependent upon  the kind of students who happen to take it.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I always try  to have a working writer as a guest for at least one meeting (we used to meet  ten Tuesday nights for two hours) and once Allen Ginsberg was the one. I barked  for one hour (Allen surprised and delighted me by dropping in unannounced so I  just kept on going with whatever I was talking about) and after the break Allen  gave a beautiful talk about and demonstration of chanting.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> After the  class, over drinks, I told Allen I had become a little concerned about the form  of the class, that gradually over the five years it had distilled into a loose,  rambling, skip-about thing that was really a course in Lew Welch, 1A.  &quot;Of course,&quot; he said, &quot;all they want is to see and hear a live  poet. Where else can they find one?&quot;</p>
    <center>&#8226;</center>
      <p class="body_justified">      That is one way of going at it. Another way  is to think of what language is from the long historical building of it.</p>
<p class="body_justified">In America we speak and write American English,  which is completely different from British  English, and it all comes from the Sanskrit, we are told, but we learned it  from our parents and our friends. It is all we have. Our native speech.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Of course there are  other speeches we have, from reading. We have Walpole saying: &quot;I write to  relieve, not the emptiness of my purse, but the fullness of my mind.&quot; It  is almost impossible to read that sentence aloud without going into a British  accent. </p>
      <p class="body_justified"> American  English has sentences in it like Burroughs': &quot;Motel, motel, motel  loneliness blows across the continent like foghorns blowing over still oily  tidal water rivers.&quot;</p>
      <center>&#8226;</center>
      <p class="body_justified">        And to know how recent it is! Whitman had no language to write in. There  was no American English when he wrote, which is why his poetry seems so awkward  at times. For all his rightness and  greatness we have to see Whitman as a man fumbling among languages, the  British, the French and the emerging American.</p>
      <center>&#8226;</center>
      <p class="body_justified"> Language is speech. You ought to be able to say language  is speech and then get on with the rest of it, but you can't because so very  few believe it.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Language is what goes on when you open the door of a  banquet-room and there are 300 ladies having lunch. It is very interesting to  hear. It rises and falls, and every once in an inexplicable while it will  suddenly stop, there will be a total silence, and then all 300 ladies will hear  that silence and comment on it at the same moment. Then you get a roar.      </p>
      <p class="body_justified">Language is speech. Any other form, the printed one or the taped one, is  a translation of language. All poems        are translations. This book is a translation of the speech I use when I  teach this course, talking to people.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Once I lived  in an upstairs room with a single window in it. Outside the window was a large  date palm tree. Every sparrow for miles around slept in that palm tree. The din  each evening was unbelievable, and it was the same thing every dawn, hundreds  of sparrows chattering to each other about where they were to sleep and how it  went last night or whatever.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> That  is language. Speech. The din of a Tribe doing its business. You can't control  it, you can't correct it, you can only listen to it and use it as it is.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> If  you want to write you have to want to build things out of language and in order  to do that you have to know, really know in your ear and in your tongue and,  later, on 
        the page, that  language is speech. But the hard thing is that writing is not talking, so what  you have to learn to do is to write as if you were talking, and to do it  knowing perfectly well you are not talking, you are writing.</p>
