      <p class="body_14_italic"><em>To Donald Allen,<br />
        from 728 Plumas Street, Reno,<br />
      18 December 1959</em></p>
      <p>
        <span class="body_justified">Don,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was written when I was 23 despite the reluctance of the entire  Reed staff (excepting Frank Jones who, even tho he could not read Stein looked  upon being my advisor as a challenge, and worked with me with good glee).
      </span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I wrote  it in 3 weeks and everybody thot it  was very good. After my orals (which I, myself, with all that youth, conducted  from a
      great overstuffed chair,  tolerating all questions, answering magnanimously), the newcritic of the  staff, Macrae, said:</p>
      <p> <span class="body_justified">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; I  wonder why I would rather read you than Stein. and I said (high, on air and  victory)</span></p>
      <p> <span class="body_justified">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Some  people would rather read anybody on anybody than anybody.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Which really hurt him and made me feel terrible because I have never been  able to speak really comfortably from my arrogance.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Then Williams came to Reed on his tour (see his <em>Autobiog.</em>) and Whalen and  Gary and I met him and we all wrote poems together, drunk, and when Williams  opened his lecturing he said: &quot;It is a pleasure to be here at Reed which  is the only college I have seen that understands the importance of Gertrude Stein.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified">        I told Williams I was coming to NY and he invited me to visit his home,  which I did, and he offered to write an intro to the book (which he always  called &quot;your Stein script&quot;) and wanted me to give it to his editor at  Random House.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> And [at] this point my big freeze began. I thot: it isn't <em>mature</em> enough.  It isn't smart enough. I don't know the difference between meaning and being. I  ought to compare it to Dewey or something. I don't want to start a critic, I'm  a poet. Etc.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Whalen  used to say: &quot;There you go Welch, flaying yourself again.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified">        The  freeze was a long one, another story, but anyway I didn't really try to do  anything with it.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> So the thesis has a story.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I think  a lot of different things about it now. Pleased at yr. request to read it. It  was typed up at great expense by an idiot steno, so you'll have to drive your  wit through typos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lew</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> [P. S.] Allen also said he'd  like to read it maybe, I'll leave that up to you  &mdash; I worry about his finding  time for real work.</p>
      <p class="body_justified">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="detail"> &quot;This was written&quot;: Welch is describing the B.A. thesis he  wrote on Gertrude Stein at Reed College in 1950.</p>
