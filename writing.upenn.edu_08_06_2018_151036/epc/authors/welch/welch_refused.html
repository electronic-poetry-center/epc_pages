        Sometimes Margaret's mind,</p>
      <p align="center"> while she sipped a single brandy <br />
        or stitched after dinner  on a dress she'd bought,</p>
      <p align="center"> would drift  on back through <br />
        all of Life and Time</p>
      <p align="center"> since first our cells slid mindlessly <br />
        in hot</p>
      <p align="center"> and ancient Seas,      </p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"> and then, before her inner eye, it soon began <br />
      to writhe  and crawl upon the land</p>
      <p align="center"> take to the trees and up on out of them <br />
        or live in them  and <br />
        climb back down again, dully</p>
      <p align="center"> staring at a broken stick and a <br />
        sharpened piece of stone,</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"> until attention fixed at last upon the complicated <br />
        liquor<br />
        the needlework<br />
        her fingers, hands, her thighs her <br />
        walls</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"> wherein she lived a clean strong life</p>
      <p align="center"> alone</p>

      The figure  of Margaret came from a waitress in a Wisconsin resort, a young girl of such  strong beauty I bewailed the vision I had of her certain loneliness. No man  could stand against her strident health, her total ability to love if loved  enough in return.</p>
      <p align="justify"> Originally the poem was to be  the final paragraph (sentence) in a short story where Margaret, the virgin at  the resort, got laid young, then became a nurse in World War II, fell in love  with a crazy army psychiatrist, returned to the U. S. (after seeing her love  for the doctor fail) and then fell in love with a real freak of
      a civilian doctor, and  finally, now nearing 40, had resigned herself to a lonely, but productive,  nursing life.</p>
      <p align="justify"> There was a  passage in the story where the author speculated on the excellence of Margaret  in pioneer days whereas today she is too powerful to be useful.</p>
      <p align="justify"> I never wrote that  story and I'm glad.<br />
