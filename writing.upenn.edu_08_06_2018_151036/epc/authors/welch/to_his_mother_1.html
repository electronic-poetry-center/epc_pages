      from 49 Southwest First Avenue, Portland,<br />
      28  September 1949</em></p>
      <p>
        <span class="body_justified">Dear Mom,&nbsp;&nbsp; Many things of interest have happened so fast  that I have not felt able to sit down and write to you. The entire school seems  to be upon a new footing. The air is charged with stimulations, but faculty and  students alike are more relaxed, and less exhausted and manifest this fact by  being witty and stimulating without the grimness I sometimes noticed last year.  Time will no doubt change this.</span></p>
      <p class="body_justified"> My adviser  received my thesis topic in a way that I had not expected. That no one would be  in position to advise me regarding [Gertrude] Stein, I knew, and this proved  to be the case &mdash; no one on the faculty has even read her, much less studied her  writings and her approach to them. I therefore was prepared to be discouraged  or to be treated with diffidence or humored or allowed to proceed on my own  with a marked lack of enthusiasm or interest of any kind. I received none of  these reactions. Instead, after outlining my possible approach to the subject  my adviser, a Mr. Frank Jones who I now admire for reasons obvious to you in a  moment, said: &quot;I have never heard a thesis subject outlined in a manner  which better convinced me that the student was upon sure ground, and more  capable of producing a worthwhile dissertation. Further, I am delighted to  think that someone has the courage to venture upon an uncharted course (the  metaphor is, I assure you, his) rather than search for a new angle upon a tired  old subject such as Virginia Woolf.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_justified">        I was, as you  might guess, somewhat overwhelmed by such a show of confidence, which later  become one of <em>respect, </em>extended to me  by one established in my field (Jones publishes in virtually every literary  review whenever he wishes to). His final position, which he assumed consciously  and which he admitted verbally, was and shall be for the duration of my undertaking,  that of a 
      guinea  pig upon which my perceptions will be tested. If the thesis is understandable  to him, we will assume that I have made my point. Actually this is an ideal  situation because he is, in a way, a symbolic representative of the group which  I shall try to reach. He is intelligent, educated in the field of literature,  receptive but doubtful of Miss Stein's worth. But most important of all, he has  not read Stein because he has not been sure that she is sincere or indeed  anything more than a literary curiosity, also I feel that he is somewhat  doubtful of his security with regards to literature, that is his security is  one that is maintained with great labor and which is an important part of his  security as a whole, and therefore I feel that he is really afraid of Stein.  He is afraid of misconstruing her and of the dangerous position he would be in  if he were to commit himself upon such a misapprehension. He is quite right,  therefore, in his decision, for one in his position would be unable to retain  the peculiar sort of relaxed attitude necessary to a study of Stein. This is a  difficult point to make clear, and not worthy of space in this context, but an  interesting angle to the whole question.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Therefore, I am in a  position of respect this year which I am sure of being able to maintain. I had  not thought that I would reach such a position at this early stage of the game,  but here it is, and on my own terms. Other indications show that my reputation  is more extensive than one which exists in the literature department alone. I  was extended permission to enroll in an advanced History course, which should  have been open only to History of Phil. majors of senior standing. It is a  course which examines, not history but historical method, examining the basic  assumptions and general orientation of historians. I wished to take the course  in order to become oriented to History, as a discipline, in the same way that I  am oriented to Anthropology. After which I hope to be able to read History on  my own with a critical understanding of method. It has always bothered me, the  basic assumptions upon which History is written.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Further, my work on Stein  is almost sure to be published, if I wish and if it is a good piece of work,  since no such work has ever been done in a satisfactory manner. Four such works  are under way at present which colors, but does not alter, the situation.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> Our rooms are now  finished and are more than pleasant. I have no classes upon either Tuesday or  Thursday and will stay at home and write the <em>nine </em>term papers and half of my thesis which are due this semester.  I am carrying 17 units which is too much, but unavoidable.  It is more than probable that I shall find it best to finish the book by next  September, rather than by June. I am not in a hurry, but am ambitious of a  success judged by standards greater than those imposed by Reed.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> I received your check on the twentieth, but am rather short of money at  present &mdash; there was a paint bill to pay. I certainly hope that my GI check will  arrive next month, but doubt it. I also received the blankets and shirts.</p>
      <p class="body_justified"> The weather has been hot and sticky and the sky clouded by forest fire  smoke. I shall welcome the rains. I hope that everything is going as well for  you as it is for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love,&nbsp;&nbsp; Lew</p>
