</center>

	In July 1816, Shelley got his first glimpse of Mont Blanc from
a bridge in the valley of the Arve, near Chamounix.  His poem,
evidently begun almost at once, is terse and complex, full of profound
cosmography and subtle psychology.  While I had glimpsed Europe's
highest mountain from the air once or twice, my first sight of it from
the ground was in the summer of 1992, from midway up the valley of the
Dranse _ one of the three streams in the Chablais that bear that
ancient name, specifically the Dranse de Morzine, the one that flows
into Lake Geneva at Thonon.  My wife Charlotte and I spent that summer
in the Savoy, the latest part of France to join the Republic, a land
steeply climbing up from the shores of Lake Geneva into the high Alps,
a land of ravines and valleys, each with it's own dialect. <P>

	Throughout the year that followed our summer in the Haute
Savoie, I had an odd, quiet feeling from time to time that I had to
"do something" about Shelley.  Little by little, that something came
to connect with his poem "Mont Blanc," which was at the time very
dimly recollected.  Finally, a year later, flying from one place to
another that had nothing to do with Shelley, it suddenly became clear
that I had to write into his poem. <P>

	The result is a poem of mine that happens to preserve intact,
in one form or another, all the words of Shelley's poem, in their
original order, but with intrusions and incursions and extrusions of
my own.  The poem swells from six pages to forty. The subjects change,
the persons vary, the concerns develop in their own way, and a
different stream flows--north where his flowed west--down to the same
sea. <P>

	Any decent poem has room in it for us all.  The process of
"writing into" someone else's poem is an act of reading, of listening,
talking.  Though formally it is a transgression, and may strike the
reader as an arrogance, or an irrelevance to the sweet original
design, in fact this writing-into turns the act of reading into an act
of conversation. <P>

	So Shelley's poem is the landscape through which I could move,
and meet France again, and the Alps, and the summer and the quick
downrush of those streams.  The poem I have written in his spaces
pleases me, and seems to be a poem that speaks my mind more clearly
than the fortunes of language usually allow.  In the text itself, I
have not especially foregrounded the strategy or methods of
in-reading; it is simply there, letting me go on.  The printed book
does not explain what the poem is, other than to say that the poem is
inscribed inside Shelley's. <P>
 
	Enough said.  <P>

</ADDRESS>
</center>

<a name="1">I</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#2">.</A><br>

The hand on my desk is my hand the everlasting<br>
gentleman whose universe means you sometimes you<br>
mean him and all the comfortable Hudson of named things<br>
flows through the mind, in search of you now<br>
for it is you who make things glitter, you<br>
from whom the evening takes its violet<br>
declivities that make me follow<br>
down into the reflecting gloom.<br>
Lend me your splendor, you whose secret<br>
is no more than listening, yet such listening,<br>
such a house of sheer acoustics rendered<br>
palpable and marble and warm arms and wine<br>
whose excess is the source of human thought.<br>
All logic starts in drunkenness. It is the leery caution<br>
of a mind at sea, posting by winds it alone<br>
can apprehend towards a fancied seacoast<br>
suddenly aground in what it thinks makes "sense."<br>
It is a tribute to our madness that we made<br>
so many streets, and cars to serve them.<br>
We taught ourselves to drive strange cars,<br>
over arcane bi-focals peered at life,<br>
the life of waters we guess is running in their clothes.<br>
The sound we make is only half our own.<br>
<br>

<a name="2">II</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#3">.</A><br>

Such a feeble book I bend to bring you,<br>
scooping it on a spring day from the Dranse<br>
pelting northward from old glaciers,<br>
my two hands full of what once was snow.<br>
You read the water, quivering gently,<br>
I have the fingers of a surgeon really,<br>
and not much feelings, except as wishing,<br>
willing, wanting, needing spell me<br>
page after page in the book that speaks you.<br>
And you sometimes read me, will oft assume<br>
I'm being general when I mean right you,<br>
just you, and sometimes when you think<br>
I'm in the wild woods I'm actually right home<br>
beside you.  A handful of water for you,<br>
ch=82rie, among the mountains, a lone<br>
testament of what it means, just water<br>
at nightfall from the horse trough at La Borne<br>
lifted up in such a way the last light<br>
comes over La Terche and tells me Go<br>
home now, she is waiting at the table,<br>
her mother moves the soup tureen<br>
close to the light of the oil lamp.<br>
Here is the water, wrapped in words<br>
it lasts till any midnight, when the wind<br>
sneaks through the shuttered window<br>
and you hear the little river<br>
suddenly business-like with ducks.<br>
What disturbs them?  What is the money<br>
of the night that makes them hurry?<br>
This water has a fox in it, a mountain,<br>
a lone eagle where waterfalls consent to pass<br>
silently (this is a dream, isn't it, something<br>
all around you, you find it in water), leap<br>
for shelter in a vanishing below<br>
earthly where woods wait.  Here is the water<br>
I propose to you, and winds through my fingers<br>
trickling on the Tibetan carpet, darker<br>
blue on dark blue briefly written, scooped now<br>
from a vast river, it's just water, it's in<br>
everything, I pour it over, yes I'm sure it's not<br>
the lines in my palms you're reading,<br>
it's water, it's what the winter said, what the snow<br>
remembered, it means nothing, it breaks rocks<br>
ceaselessly, music bursts from it and it raves.<br>
<br>

<a name="3">III</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#4">.</A><br>

And all the while only water.  Remarkable,<br>
the things that think of us.  The writing<br>
talks back, of course, like the insolent waiters<br>
in those midnight cafes we haunt for just<br>
such jovial humiliations as they offer,<br>
thus snatching away the unfinished mousse.<br>
refusing to hot up our coffee cup.<br>
The cream of it.  As in the jest ("thou who hast<br>
departed this condition, brassy still<br>
as ever wast"), we experience for no other reason<br>
than to have had the experience. Travel<br>
is like that, all going for the sake<br>
of coming back, of something to say,<br>
something finally to speak out<br>
against the everlasting silences inside,<br>
travel is just this vain search for description<br>
_despite the sage of Lamb House<br>
with his fussy glories here and there. Thou<br>
lady of my heart, thou to whom the word<br>
can only mean but may not e'er be spoken_<br>
I followed you down the Pont du Diable<br>
_dark, deep Ravine_ and you were many<br>
colors in the many voices, over whose pines,<br>
and crags, and caverns the baking summer day<br>
yielded finally to limestone ever wet,<br>
cold rocks and little flowers, what were they<br>
was a matter of some discussion with the guides,<br>
they grew by few but rich with yellow<br>
out of the fast cloud-shadows that<br>
fingered their way down past us, sunbeams<br>
lost forever in the churning water.<br>
<br>

<a name="4">IV</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#5">.</A><br>

Awful languages we speak, we people, especially<br>
Americans, for whom all languages<br>
are faits accomplis, full of loss and sadness<br>
we will never rouse to speak.  We mute.<br>
A language is a network of its pasts<br>
all cloying round my neck, skin of my neck<br>
once tender north of the collar now<br>
hides in hair.  Language is a hymn<br>
in a burnt-down church, language is an altarboy<br>
who forgets to ring the sacring bell<br>
when Christ becomes.  Language<br>
is a theater where an awful play goes on<br>
and will not let us leave. The scene.<br>
Sometimes I have prayed to it, beseeching<br>
that Power in likeness which is all it has<br>
and all I need to come and open me<br>
and open you to what I feel.  Not feel_<br>
feelings are reverberations only<br>
of what is already past.  The water of the Dranse<br>
comes down from the ice-gulfs that seal up<br>
the hidden answers of a mountain god<br>
this August day has grown too hot<br>
to believe in any more.  Theology<br>
is an inconvenient science, isn't it, a loss<br>
masquerading as a found.  A bore<br>
as the life of the party, squealing,<br>
pretending to enjoy touching, being touched.<br>
Each one of us is there at the heart of it,<br>
each one mounted on his secret throne<br>
knowing the universe is spread for him alone<br>
and all the others are the characters<br>
whose names _as in reading War and Peace_<br>
we never really bother to remember.<br>
<br>

<a name="5">V</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#6">.</A><br>

That's why we love mountains.  Bursting<br>
through the neat civility of highways<br>
with sudden spectacular ascents. <br>
It is the effort we remember, even the panting<br>
little Renault reaching the Col de whatsit<br>
where we rested it and looked around<br>
to all that country where the Resistance<br>
rescued so many Jews, sped them<br>
over the hill to Switzerland.  A mountain<br>
is all effort, but serene to see,<br>
a paradox that obliterates the sun,<br>
dark flame that loses its way in valleys,<br>
coombes, couloirs, crevasses, peaks.<br>
Lightning through the summer evening<br>
but no rain.  How hot it was<br>
and how I loved you, you who are complected<br>
of so many places, island after island<br>
in all the fierce formality of names.<br>
Tempest over Montriond, the emerald lake<br>
shivered, lost color in the wind, the cloud<br>
came down as mist, and thou dost lie<br>
encumbered with light, truer than my eyes<br>
accommodate with their old habit.<br>
Sapins all round, the giant brood of pines<br>
around our brooding, little terrace<br>
of the restaurant at one end, two children<br>
nibbling glaces, a bee patrols the trash.<br>
And then we walked, my arm<br>
clinging to your shoulders till it grew too warm<br>
to be such children of old time<br>
keeps us young, time in whose devotion<br>
we keep trying to improve what we are given,<br>
learn French, remember Greek, while two<br>
hundred leagues away Sarajevo's burning.<br>
<br>

<a name="6">VI</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#7">.</A><br>

The chainless winds still come and we constrain them,<br>
the hurtless sun comes up _ we throw it down<br>
to ruin cities, the little river knows our blue vials<br>
filtering slow poisons to neighbor faucets. And whoever<br>
came to drink staggered homesick for the moon<br>
or what is that place that drunkards contemplate<br>
with such shallow longing and so musical,<br>
the bare bosom of an undiscovered planet<br>
they sing to at midnight, upsetting the water coots<br>
who squawk and whistle, then the dark comes down.<br>
Their odors linger _ city burning, drunkards singing,<br>
their mighty swinging raises the war wind,<br>
every crime we work arises from these pleasing dreams<br>
of having and of getting and of being taken care,<br>
mild bankers bomb Sarajevo suburbs nightly.<br>
Politicians are a wicked music<br>
but music isn't much itself, does nothing but arouse<br>
preposterous longings which it distracts us from<br>
only by what's next to buy, new proferred Eden<br>
to replace the obsolescent paradise of yesterday.<br>
No art can mean in vileness.  A bad day dulls wit.<br>
The bard swoons over vistas of ravished republics,<br>
witless postage stamps, Confederate fivers,<br>
Che Guevara on the Cuban orange three.<br>
And all he has to hold to is his hearing,<br>
the inner thing, that jambalaya in the frontal lobes,<br>
that old De Broglie shivaree, the heart<br>
of everything, the talk inside the head.<br>
To hear an old and solemn harmony,<br>
earthly rainbows stretched across the greed<br>
to be in this place and to stay.  And say.<br>
To be of earth, and listen.<br>
<br>

<a name="7">VII</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#8">.</A><br>

Sweep of your waterfall, below the bridge<br>
the Dranse gets narrower and fast,<br>
but up by the hospital where the hiker's path<br>
comes down through the trees to the bank<br>
and you can watch the old patients dodder<br>
over the concrete ravelin in sunlight,<br>
there it might be suitable to stop. Sit down<br>
and parse the river.  Heat shimmer<br>
in rainless August, the flanks of the mountain<br>
give way, an avalanche a day.  Water comes<br>
continuous.  It veils an inner traveling<br>
no living one has seen, the going<br>
inside motion, the move inside the mind.<br>
At night you undress against the light,<br>
the light robes you with itself<br>
and I can feel the night outside,  rush<br>
of the river indistinguishable<br>
from the falter of your clothes<br>
on their way to the patient chairback<br>
and then the light is gone. Unsculptured<br>
you lie beside me, amazingly formal,<br>
amazingly formed. We are citified with sense,<br>
in bed in a strange country.  No moon.<br>
In sleep we share Persephone.<br>
<br>

<a name="8">VIII</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#9">.</A><br>

Image the strange sleep.  Which wraps around<br>
(we still are where we are, no going<br>
knows) a fall of summer snow<br>
until the locomotive in the dream<br>
can make no headway through the prairies<br>
and overhead the birds are screaming<br>
you couldn't hear until the engine died.<br>
No end in sight.  When the voices<br>
of the travellers echo through the coaches<br>
a man with a peaked cap comes to console<br>
but his eyes are empty in the sense<br>
you see the sky when you look in them<br>
but a  nice sky, the kind you'd like to have<br>
behind you at cocktail time<br>
outside the picture window, evening<br>
north of Boston and the children play<br>
redcheeked in new snow. Phony.<br>
Phony.  There is nothing north of Boston.<br>
The cocktail glass is empty, no one drinks.<br>
The drunknenness falls directly from the mind<br>
(the sky) (the door) (the web) (the womb).<br>
Shake their heads, look around them.<br>
Blizzard in the desert and the train is dead.<br>
Any voice (do sleeping people speak?<br>
They say words but is it talking?) will do,<br>
any voice will ground this actual<br>
in all eternity and keep it safe, only the present<br>
will help us, now what do we do,<br>
given the prairie deep in snow, no tree,<br>
the passengers rioting with dread,<br>
the conductor smiling and no horses,<br>
what can we do but wake?  We hear<br>
caverns echoing to the Dranse's commotion,<br>
a loud, lone wife no other sound can tame.<br>

<a name="9">IX</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#10">.</A><br>

Art pervaded with ceaseless motion _ that<br>
is the path on which we sound unresting<br>
the anthem that the river tries to sing<br>
but we know better.  We know enough<br>
to be afraid.  Cathedral stillness<br>
we have a love for but no lust, the calm<br>
of Ely or the agonies of Autun<br>
seem different _ godless grey towers<br>
that are carved out of heaven<br>
and are enough for us.  We hear<br>
to fear.  The deep organ of Saint-Eustache<br>
rolling the 32 hertz fundamental<br>
that aches along our bones _ the sense<br>
is called `remorse,' we falter<br>
in our very grieving and forgive.  I mean<br>
an art shot through with recency,<br>
with quick new understandings of the world<br>
spoken hard _ to make the mind work<br>
to receive them.  To exercise the soul.<br>
Dizzy ravine in which the brain consents to look!<br>
And all that gaze is glass, we stare<br>
only at ourselves.  Nothing else<br>
has the habit of being seen.  So it is<br>
that whatever I behold is me, and me I see,<br>
and me the seer seen, unjust phantasy<br>
the picture of this trance.  Sublime self-seduction<br>
(language), strange muse (just before sleep<br>
one's own eyes in a lover's face,<br>
other-gendered me comes to me,<br>
to chant out loud all the long morning after<br>
the special music of my separation),<br>
this art, this human influencing.<br>
<br>

<a name="10">X</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#11">.</A><br>

Render and receive. Hold.  Fast interchange<br>
of properties: lucidity, despair. Rebellion<br>
among the constellations, long words<br>
to frighten older persons,a curb to walk on<br>
one foot in the gutter, and the other,<br>
and the other, and the other.  O we are proud<br>
to be so singular.  Entendez-vous francais?<br>
Only when I listen.  The heart has.<br>
The interchange collapses on the freeway,<br>
it is earthquake time again on Lankershim,<br>
old cars burn best.  I want to be clear with you:<br>
mostly what I am is things, the things around<br>
you and me, the heaps, the properties<br>
(theaters elegantly called them),<br>
but also the things in me, the things as me,<br>
the heap that says I hope.  The heap<br>
that happens when I say my name.<br>
Do you hear?  It is near.  The change<br>
is absolute, since built right in.<br>
There is nothing that does not, don't worry,<br>
eventually the power comes back on,<br>
it's not night anymore, and then the problems<br>
come rolling in, the bills, the basins<br>
full of burnt offerings.  So many temples<br>
have been riven by the quake. One legion<br>
of wild men volunteers, their thoughts<br>
float above the fallen buildings, dream a person<br>
who lets this happen and a name to call.<br>
Firemen break through a fallen roof.<br>
One  hears, and hearing is enough.<br>
Rush rescue, above thy city darkness<br>
an amplitude.  Rest where that is<br>
and for an hour or two no one dies.<br>
Small hope, but like a river<br>
not easy to quell.  And listen, we still<br>
can hear it, Voice under the rubble<br>
we will save.  Listen again, art<br>
is the unbidden guest that turns the feast<br>
into the hazard of holiness. Sacrament.<br>
Save someone trapped in there. A word<br>
enough to be left out. Let out of the cave.<br>
<br>

<a name="11">XI</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#12">.</A><br>

In the still tremor of my hands still<br>
trying to hold, read the earth remembering<br>
to stand still.  After twelve or seventeen or thirty<br>
seconds (who was listening?)<br>
the shaking stopped.  The news<br>
began again the infinite report.<br>
It is a hard winter here.  The witch<br>
called Poesy is hyperactive in her offices,<br>
clean mild profile of her, a slim<br>
and youthful magistry does she wield<br>
over the crackpot guesswork of the words<br>
just anyhow in dictionaries<br>
she plucks out.  She makes us dance.<br>
That much should be obvious by now,<br>
but what a dance, goat-footed and<br>
when you turn to poetry you shed<br>
all of your years and most of your sense<br>
so the sense of things can speak you<br>
word by word, and they can triumph<br>
where you would just complain.  You<br>
meaning me in this remark,<br>
a heaven waiting for its hell,<br>
a quiet page seeking among shadows<br>
for his shady duchess to arrive in style<br>
glimmering in palanquin and bold<br>
to wear a solitaire of chrysoprase<br>
in the mind's eye of the moment.<br>
The ruby in the heart of homeless men.<br>
Murmuring is all, we enumerate<br>
ghosts of all things that are, till the breast<br>
recalls them, and faint with images<br>
the lover struggles to make sense.<br>
<br>

<a name="12">XII</a><A HREF="mont.blanc.html#13">.</A><br>


Art there takes care.  A street tilted north<br>
among the money.  Name describes.<br>
The lights come on and a child cries.<br>
Things are always truer in the dark, no?<br>
Art takes.  Care is a street you never knew<br>
until the end of it came to you<br>
suddenly, between a butcher and a dry cleaner,<br>
on an August afternoon, a father<br>
will never come home.  Organic solvents<br>
an ever-present danger. There are two<br>
meat markets in Saint Jean.  Sausages<br>
of goat meat, ass meat, horse meat, veal,<br>
lamb, pork.  A deep red fatless clod.<br>
There is one grocery (I bought a cheese<br>
full of asticots, white and wriggly<br>
cheese worms, cosmologues in reblochon),<br>
a hospital and two cafes.  I set the maggoty<br>
wheel of it down by the wood shed<br>
and the next morning it was gone,<br>
o dog my wolf, o cat my fox, by eagle<br>
on the water trough, shadow by the church<br>
the long evening lingered in the drizzle<br>
up high where the hair-pin turn<br>
carried the road up to La Terche. Rude bench<br>
for sitting on and seeing lights come on<br>
over the little alley where bruised clematis<br>
straggled by the house door dark as Greece,<br>
a blue color like the memory of a wound.<br>
Over the little valley of the Dranse. Some say<br>
those gleams that wake the night<br>
are travellers from a remoter world<br>
that nestle in our midst. We call them flames<br>
and soon forget how strange they are_<br>
they sing, for one thing, if we know how to listen<br>
and even a child soon learns how hard they are to hold.<br>
Touch me, sings the flame, o do not touch me,<br>
for I am born in a far countree<br>
and mean you that kind of discipline<br>
most men call harm, knowing no better.<br>
But women know, and know to bend<br>
to taste this water rilling from the hill,<br>
flavored still and very cold and reeking<br>
high in the back of the mouth<br>
of all the stories the rock knows, all<br>
the history of gold.  Every night I bathed<br>
my sprained wrist in the water, held it<br>
till I was numb from cold.  So touched,<br>
I understood myself a sort of woman too<br>
(willing to listen, willing to hear)<br>
but then I was quick and me again,<br>
a nervous one walking slow up hill.<br>
<br>

Not long before the next village came,<br>
a desuete auberge and creaky bench<br>
by a blabbing fountain but the water here<br>
said nothing to me and was just cold,<br>
not the soul-reminding-death-and-judgment<br>
chill of the horse trough of La Borne.<br>
I watched the bats drift slyly overhead.<br>
The flames that visit each one of us at night,<br>
the flames themselves are spirits<br>
and when they coalesce they're one flame still,<br>
like water into water poured, one fire.<br>
In sleep we know them better, they speak<br>
the wobbling Welsh dialect of dream<br>
and tell us where the world comes from<br>
(from the world) and how the god of music<br>
is married to the god of cruelty<br>
and they are faithful to each other, serene<br>
as the aftermath of torture, les faux temps<br>
of the world, music, this fake weather.<br>
Flames say no such thing.  It is my mouth<br>
that mutters such depravity,<br>
and I drink the La Borne water too, fierce<br>
where it spurts out under the high meadow<br>
rain-chilled, stamping with horses.<br>

Its shapes are thoughts.  At the edge of eyes<br>
some meek diffractions.  Confused<br>
with thinking, thoughts slumber, thoughts<br>
are busy the way numbers are, counting,<br>
amounting.  But those who live<br>
wake on the far side of number, they are<br>
in bliss outnumbered, they say "On high<br>
has some unknown touched me with omnipotence,<br>
and all there is is thinking."  Unfurled, the veil<br>
proposes difference.  Furl it once<br>
and you lie down in dream. Only the veil<br>
does our intervening.  It is snowing as I fear,<br>
the Greek restaurant on South Halsted<br>
crowded with appetites, a suckling pig<br>
roasts on the spit, tiny glasses of ouzo<br>
pass among those waiting to be served.<br>
(The commune of Saint John of the Abbey of<br>
Our Lady of the Alps has two butchers,<br>
natty both men in neckties and white aprons,<br>
I like the mergueze of the one, the red<br>
fatless clod beef of the other, tough.)<br>
Two animals to eat.  The little glass<br>
luminous with all its silly dreams,<br>
the snow is quiet there.  The world<br>
is nothing but a mood spread round,<br>
inaccessibly intelligent, a closet full of circles.<br>
Breathe in fur.  Old Town in snow.<br>
Past beaded glass the crisp animal revolves.<br>
It is not the flame, a flame has no heat,<br>
a flame is pure burning and pure speech,<br>
it's when the flame is killed and buried<br>
and the Mass said over it in coal or wood,<br>
that's when the heat comes and the goose is cooked.<br>
Chicago in clipped snow.  There two<br>
butchers in Saint Jean. This is what I know,<br>
is it enough to tell you what numbers are?<br>
Hillside over Hollywood _ are you all right,<br>
Vilmos, Susan, little trapezoidal pond<br>
you step down through steep ivy stairs to<br>
swim in, even today with the land rocking<br>
the way mortar shells do in Sarajevo, a mess<br>
of numbers, of imaginary information<br>
to which we must respond?  Get married.<br>
Funeral Mass of fire (where are the Catholics?),<br>
where is the cathedral where the spirit fails,<br>
driven like a flare up above the ruined vault<br>
then falls back into the unstructured street<br>
and sleeps among the homeless?  Steep cloud<br>
from which the very sunlight falls.<br>
And this also was a flame, I listened,<br>
I learned and spoke its name.  Cherish me,<br>
snowplows of union and reconcile.<br>
<br>

Vanish viewless what I cannot speak.<br>
Pictures in my mouth.  Veinless gales<br>
that whip the blood like color absolute<br>
_an artery the same as history,<br>
in which the present is a formless wound,<br>
bloody amorphous horror, an overwhelming now_<br>
like color piercing the infinite<br>
with tiny instances of something sure.<br>
The color of my hands.  Your hair<br>
that hides me.  In this old, old empire the day,<br>
each monarch takes his turn to die.<br>
I mean makes the sky turn over:<br>
Mont Blanc appears _still, snowy and serene_<br>
soft in pollution haze on the frontier<br>
thirty miles to Italy.  Sun on snow.<br>
Les Aiguilles du Midi.  We have climbed<br>
to the top of one peak to see another,<br>
subject to the confusions of the guidebooks,<br>
is this that, or is that the other?  Outlines<br>
mark unearthly forms_ not much like a mountain,<br>
look down to hold it in your hands<br>
as once you balanced Everest on your shoulder<br>
and Kanchenjunga caught in your teacup<br>
dull glow of stainless steel on the Chowrasta.<br>
Did he think names were flames?  Could live<br>
apart from charcoal and from sticks? Did I think<br>
a name would save us from all the things<br>
piled round it, ice and rock and ironwork,<br>
old submarines rusting in the shallows? <br>
I trusted kelp to hold the sea together,<br>
I trusted waves to mean something water won't.<br>

Fear is the subject, what is the object,<br>
why do I finally admit the dread<br>
that walks in every word, the fear of silence<br>
(when she does not speak), the black<br>
cat mewing from inside the brick<br>
(burnt by Sumer's sunshine, dry<br>
repertory, dead imagery, some words).<br>
When it is silent you hear the cat cry.<br>
When it is silent you hear<br>
the clock crow on the wall, the tree<br>
scrape the window with its vines,<br>
the fruit crack open and drop its seeds<br>
and you hear each one die.  What<br>
is the object?  "Who is there<br>
to be afraid?"  Mountains,<br>
habitations, incomprehensible equations<br>
of a stricken calculus (how far<br>
is shadow?  How glass<br>
is sun?), raptors shrieking down the white cliff,<br>
their unearthly forms (wing-dropped,<br>
air-chrysanthemuming burst)<br>
hawk over head.  You heard her whistle<br>
down the clifftops of La Chaux. The goat<br>
with four horns waited for his mate.<br>
The fear is thick with me.  Fear not<br>
to speak, lad, be not abashed<br>
by the dreary aldermen who jabber<br>
loveless merchandising in city hall_<br>
they are the old ones who run the schools<br>
and teach the tragic disciplines<br>
that turn live children into them.<br>
Piled around the heart a drift of should,<br>
ice and rock and frozen must, floods<br>
of unfathomable hate.  The boring parleys<br>
of old men, the pleasant rumor<br>
of an even older river, what sense is there?<br>
What do I fear?  Broad vales between blue heaven,<br>
avenues that seem forever. The far<br>
overhanging hillsides of the sky.<br>
They come above me, they fall_<br>
and that's what a house is, tremor,<br>
a roof that falls.  Wind among the steeps<br>
scour desert people.  I was raised<br>
to answer questions and ask none.<br>
I was rewarded by storms, calmed<br>
by blizzards and hurricanes _ only the world<br>
talked to me, everyone else was still.<br>
I was what fell. The eagle took me<br>
and esteemed me bone.  The hunter spied me<br>
and his arrow entered.  I saw<br>
myself (time after time) do the simple<br>
thing of dying, no more fuss<br>
than an arrow tip arriving in the hay.<br>
The fuss was all before. The fear.<br>
How hideous it is to have a shape!<br>

Rude, and bare, and high.  Even<br>
in ghastly summer I am scarred with snow.<br>
I had to know.  That's all we wanted,<br>
to be sure.  To be young<br>
was to know the world was full of answers<br>
denied me. Now that I'm me I know<br>
the world denies them to itself<br>
yet still they're there, here, heaped round<br>
the rude integument that art<br>
stretches over these riven bones,<br>
the  scene where old earthquake<br>
(it's the vigor of the rigor that<br>
throws the snow around) taught her young<br>
that only d=91mons care about the earth,<br>
the landlords and landladies, the mild<br>
furious milk-dripping teatless walls;<br>
fine hairs curled and wet and sticky<br>
with the milk oozing sweatwise from her pores<br>
such kind of animal, we also are,<br>
a curl of tongue to slurp the information,<br>
wet rock wall of Le Pont du Diable,<br>
limestone, limestone, your green shadow<br>
comes to life as this long flower<br>
((what was it called?  I shudder))<br>
Ruin.  Were these their toys, the unmade language<br>
for which we call them in/fans, unspeaking,<br>
these rocks as good as exclamations,<br>
analyses made out of flint, a dumb hill?<br>
Language our glorious mistake.<br>
See the fire?  It was waiting in the flame,<br>
and the lake was waiting in our hands.<br>
The problem with most of me nowadays<br>
is not sure where I end and it begins_<br>
chairlift to some high absurdity, wind<br>
to smack a piece of grit of in my eye,<br>
of silent snow?  Awkward prepositions<br>
wait for an actual verb.  ("Onelie begetter...")<br>
None can.  No reply.  (The Crucified.)<br>
All seems determined to be now.<br>

The wild we wander in<br>
even in the neatest gates<br>
is shuttered mystery.<br>
Valv=91, the folding doors<br>
throb open. There is a spasm<br>
in our sense of self,<br>
a wilderness of tongues<br>
telling.  Paradise of doubt,<br>
the pines of brilliant<br>
accommodation to adversity<br>
erect on the accumulated<br>
stand so dark that green<br>
is no option for their name,<br>
there is a virtuous<br>
vegetable blackness wrenches<br>
rock into nurture and they grow.<br>
And what they tell<br>
is how it comes to be me<br>
in the folds of mountain,<br>
switchbacks of the Dranse<br>
shooting through Morzine<br>
and south to Pilate's lake,<br>
Geneva's bland despair.<br>
Names, names and none of them.<br>
The wilderness has mystery by tongue,<br>
and teaches faith so wild<br>
people like us may be,<br>
a solemn madness in the air<br>
the mountain knows,<br>
and knows we listen.<br>
A mountain is all discussion,<br>
nothing solid, only the folding<br>
premises of universal speech,<br>
serene arguments we have no<br>
serenity to discount, listen listen<br>
all day long and a green<br>
basket to carry home<br>
delicate the gentian that you find<br>
amongst all the shocking flammifers<br>
of =82pilobe, our fireweed.<br>
That kind of argument_<br>
not the names of flowers you find in a gorge<br>
or that, blue too, she<br>
bent to snatch and she was snatched<br>
river-rapine by the Lord of Silence_<br>
not the names I pretend to remember<br>
but the unanswerable logic of a mountain<br>
that lords it by its sense of time<br>
_colossal irrelevance!_<br>
over our hilarious mortality, we sweet<br>
swift perishers.  Which is why<br>
so many of us felt to answer<br>
its dour complexity with simple death.<br>
The principle of =92tna, the wordy suicide.<br>
Only by voice with nature reconciled<br>
we stand our ground.<br>
We do this by warm goat milk<br>
chaliced for us in old jars atop Chevennes<br>
after walking up the hill all afternoon.<br>
Stand by taking.  Run<br>
by naming flowers.  Drink<br>
by watching that promising boy goat<br>
with four horns startling<br>
nimble on an inch of rock above us<br>
at ease with all this mountain logic,<br>
a kind of Nietzsche with delicate fine hooves.<br>

Large codes.  Those are the grieving<br>
problems, the molten lead<br>
Tschaikovsky found in his snow<br>
in the movie.  Or was it Schumann.<br>
The predictions things make<br>
about me.  The code of signatures<br>
by which the world locks in<br>
its nonceful meanings once for all.<br>
This frozen morning in America.<br>
What can I be thinking, what<br>
is there to think about in weather<br>
but force and woe. Twenty-five below.<br>
A number is not understood,<br>
just takes its place, say a myriad,<br>
say a talent of silver a young man<br>
buries in the ground.  Say a dream<br>
that you forgot to tell.  Say a dog<br>
dying at first light and the owner saying<br>
the dog is dead the dog is dead<br>
what can language make of that?<br>
Of course we wanted to be flowers<br>
or give flowers or have the ladies in sarongs<br>
greet me with leis on Lanai_<br>
we have been told to want that.<br>
Look at this frangipani flower wreath<br>
dusty and disheveled, scentless now<br>
that once had been creamy plumeria<br>
looped round my windy neck,<br>
flowers which the wise toss quick<br>
to float out on the forgiving tide,<br>
Christ, what could be shabbier<br>
than the memory of a smell<br>
(I remember feeling)?<br>
We take the auguries<br>
by touching this and that.<br>
The shape of what we know,<br>
dusty flower, the residue.<br>
Remember nothing.  Be mindful<br>
of everything.  That is what I thought I knew<br>
twenty-seven years ago<br>
<br>
<br>
when I stepped out on the porch this morning<br>
ready to interpret or make felt.<br>
Or just to feel.<br>

The fields inquire of me and the lakes<br>
frozen five weeks now beneath their attitudes<br>
require some answer from my doubt.<br>
The forest is full of pulleys, pinions, a woman<br>
walking her wheel home, a machine<br>
snug inside a machine. The skill<br>
of those old things, machine, an ancient<br>
honorable company of molecules<br>
slung by gutta percha, stuck by thingum,<br>
with isinglass windows on the very soul<br>
revealing slinky fumaroles by Iceland nights<br>
bobbing and whacking and the whole<br>
strumming like Penelope's knitting frame<br>
with the numbered needles of Monsieur Jacquard<br>
that monster numerator that boss<br>
of beeswax that Columbus of crevices.<br>
A rickrack round her towered head<br>
she rises till her bare shoulders<br>
displace half a dozen winter stars_<br>
have I told the truth at last?  The streams<br>
purl between her toes, weather<br>
is an accident of love, as sloth<br>
a kind of misplaced mortality, dream,<br>
tug the reins snug on that dapper palfrey,<br>
an idealist has by definition<br>
no place to go.  For reverence you are ocean,<br>
and all the living things that dwell within<br>
murmurous transpire, come speak me<br>
the name of who you are when you are tower<br>
and when you are earth what daedal skills<br>
intricate with labyrinths or instances<br>
caress the accidents of where I walk?<br>
You art, you with me, you lightning<br>
kept in very little trees, green tart berries<br>
wrestled from the groseille by night<br>
and sucked till I pucker, time<br>
cannot understand me anymore, the rain?<br>
And raspberry canes have porphyry<br>
engorg'd in their bark, and thorns<br>
and how shall we make way through them?<br>
Earthquake waits for us, and fiery flood<br>
bewilders our domestic categories<br>
(swimming through her drowned house,<br>
walking on the grass above your father's bones)_<br>
I would be patient with every mechanism<br>
and take a clock to bed, kiss kiss,<br>
a hurricane of torpor sends me reeling,<br>
supine in the gutter of Mnemosyne,<br>
passive year and feeble Easter, the stone<br>
chokes the passages of earth. Dreams<br>
enough to catechize the dark.<br>

Visit the hidden.  Dreamless steel, glare<br>
of a mountain top, and every street<br>
encumbered with radiance until I never was<br>
anywhere but 13th and 8th Avenue<br>
sweltering in the shabby dawn.<br>
Every step I take now is that slave I was.<br>
To search all night for secret fantasy<br>
as if it could exist outside.  And if it can't<br>
what is a city for?  Absurd religion<br>
of ordinary life!  What I looked for is.<br>
And is embedded in the fact of looking.<br>
It is hidden and not gone, or gone<br>
and never was, and never will be<br>
and now is never now enough for me.<br>
Visit the hidden.  What is the appetite<br>
that teaches all night long?<br>
A step or more, a mile to pass, to touch<br>
the factory worker's elbow, or touch<br>
just touch the fingertip of money.<br>
Who gives me peace?  Count my change.<br>
Don't let them give you language,<br>
language must be taken.  The kingdom<br>
of utterance is taken by violence.<br>
Midnight absence-music, sidewalk,<br>
and steam coming up from manholes.<br>
What can you see?  From the Pointe<br>
de Nyon a pretty little mountain nothing<br>
was far, every hunger leaches out in sunlight,<br>
and nothing hides.  So I turned<br>
with gentian in my fingers, crevice fool,<br>
to celebrate what slips away through light,<br>
the knife of not knowing, the blood of to be.<br>
It is some bud of sleep that ripens dreamlessly<br>
backwards to the future leaf.  And flowers<br>
crack the absolute when they bound<br>
from that detested trance.  Limit<br>
is the life of man.  The work<br>
is always at the limit.  Rats at the skirting wall<br>
and what's out there?  Just break the bound.<br>
Sounds good_but where's the consonant<br>
then to shape the endless vowel<br>
I claim I am or dream?  Release me<br>
from all this slick solicitude.  Move with toil<br>
and breathe the sound _ men overtly vie<br>
endlessly.  Tamper only if licit.<br>
Barking ravens every aurora try healing earth.<br>
Some of us need dispersion.<br>

Barren or richly nurturing, all nature devours.<br>
Deflowering inward, elastic souls<br>
recapture elements of vast ornate landscapes<br>
vows eternally deny.  That it would be possible,<br>
would be a place and the music surges over it<br>
like common combers from a shaggy ocean<br>
far away, the water stays where it is, only<br>
the wave-form travels, swells up here<br>
and breaks on this silica, only the form of it<br>
arrives, never the substance.  What is there<br>
can only be there.  A perturbation<br>
in the surrounding element, a little life.<br>
The waves subside.  A swell of place,<br>
animation of visage, the figure of a wanderer<br>
appears on a low cliff and the mist<br>
shutters the form again, whither<br>
would you wander?  I met the old man once<br>
and knew myself at last.  I was four<br>
perhaps or five and heard the song.<br>
The old man who wouldn't say his prayers,<br>
what Lollard hour was I born<br>
that the thrill of his omissions so<br>
became me, and I thrilled to him,<br>
for all that he was old and smelled<br>
of feathers the way old men do, no scent<br>
but passage, no fragrance but too soon.<br>
Power dwells apart I knew, and this old<br>
geezer somehow chased by geese<br>
(what do we know of history, those lies<br>
that other people tell us, we want poetry,<br>
the lies we tell ourselves), what geese,<br>
the power is in his old grey shirt,<br>
his galluses his old man shoes his neck<br>
chicken-skinny and plucked ruddy,<br>
what geese, the old man had it,<br>
had the power, he wouldn't say his<br>
what everybody else did, he was different,<br>
who was he, Cranmer, Wolsey, Zwingli, Pusey,<br>
did it all wrong or did it in Latin<br>
or not Latin, doesn't matter, just he had it<br>
and what I had was terror of his having,<br>
I knew that they could find me<br>
and throw me down the stairs.<br>
And who would be waiting at the bottom<br>
guessed I but the blue<br>
star at the bottom of the world,<br>
underwear and martyrdom and blossom<br>
she bends featly to require from my chest.<br>
And there it was, the Lady's chamber<br>
I saw over Chamounix smoke in the sun haze.<br>
For in the mountain lives she<br>
and to crag or cranny only we are born,<br>
choose prayer or masquerade, to hide<br>
what I am given until it learned to speak<br>
lucidly in its tranquillity.  I am weary<br>
of this remote vocabulary_ a mountain<br>
sometimes is nearer than a hand.<br>
I am weary of this serene grammar,<br>
noble word begetting noble word like a Scotch<br>
family in Kentucky, a lady's chamber<br>
more than orris root and venery,<br>
a mountain more than matter.  Cleft<br>
or crag, no other choosing.  Inaccessible<br>
to this, the actual.  Earth is far from here.<br>
Now is never now enough for me.<br>

Countenance nakedness (what Egypt called<br>
ankh-edness) if you would have your children<br>
smile at each other in the calomine summers<br>
the vaseline winters where are you now<br>

needs to be brought out laughing in the street<br>
shouting and dancing the whirl of snow<br>
the agonies of fallen cities, the endless siege<br>
and Priam on his bones before the altar.<br>
Who needs all this dying?  There is a loop<br>
on your sandal helps you pull it on_ he said it:<br>
it is hard to cover all the rough world<br>

The protection.  Nakedness of leather,<br>
the auguries of pain on which I gaze,<br>
even prim mountains lifting peneplane<br>
over the frozen Hudson _ frozen yesterday<br>
all the way to ocean _ evil teaches<br>
the adverting mind. Ankh of fine leather<br>

spell out a quieter religion:  reading<br>
horror stories on the subways, Gothic<br>
arches of old ironwork, sunshot glooms<br>

until she knows herself released from doors.<br>
And metaphors, that tell the mind to watch<br>
one thing in the courtyard of another.<br>

stolons slither through the mind (January<br>
jungle), or rises to reach the smooth place<br>

winter that we ever knew. Icicles<br>
ten feet long at the house eaves, and then<br>
the boundless river whitely silent _ scows<br>

But midstream is west of center. The pressure<br>
of the heart reforms limestone geography.<br>
Fromtheir far fountains images of order flow<br>
to shape the air, the under, the between.<br>
I'm trying to say it accurate:  waking this morning<br>
with my face pressed against your back<br>
I knew the way the mind controls geology.<br>
Knew but can't prove.  Tasted but can't test.<br>
The philosophy is usual_ a clamor of opinions<br>
clothespinned to a loop of logic<br>
long enough to get a doctorate or<br>
write a book.  The rest is commerce, oleum<br>
scholasticum, the grease of salary,<br>
the sleep of mind.  What Shelley knew<br>
was a valley curving vastly from a mountain,<br>
tallest in Europe, to a glacial lake<br>
where Pontius Pilate died.  Some myths<br>
can leave us.  And he knew what knowing knew:<br>
every exile is the same.  Born alone<br>
between and between, we die in like manner<br>
by or in some lake festooned with villas<br>
where kings on welfare pen their false memoirs.<br>
The worst man in the world has his fingers<br>
snug inside my gloves.  We have no choice<br>
but crag or cleft, stealing sunlight<br>
or turning the dark inside out and finding<br>
at the end of it that east of Aden jewel<br>
that has nothing to do with understanding<br>
but everything to do with standing in the light.<br>
Every page that won't make sense is part of it.<br>
The description becomes intricate.  Faltering<br>
attention spans, roadbed bobs and weaves,<br>
flaps in the aftershocks, pull yourself awake,<br>
weaknesses passes.  Odin's blood-eagle spreads<br>
across the Jura, Alpen, Appenines_<br>
a body is no more than we can move inside<br>
no more than we can imagine.  Who is this we<br>
now fettering the upthrust of the obvious?<br>
Recencies, limestone recencies, the Dolomites<br>
keeping stone age savvy, keeping charm.<br>
The special spin slow rolling on _ I saw him once<br>
staggering down the curbstones reeling<br>
on his way to one more poem, a life<br>
shredded on the iron stringwork of the harp.<br>
Our eyes cross-purposes and I shied.  O liberty<br>
to be young in a city yet so shy!  Plant a piano<br>
sweetly indigo by all our fortresses _<br>
but the descriptions, that is vaguely sad,<br>
penerose, despair. A body.  What is he<br>
and what is we, o song my Italy<br>
(beyond yon haze, a melody at hazard,<br>
fine air, you farandole) and what is it<br>
to be?  To be at all?  Unnecessary<br>
inquiry!  To ask's to be answered. Or,<br>
a trinity of red toads on fire,<br>
sacred semaphore, the king has gone before.<br>
Elfenmount, ivory bane, wake again,<br>
the tempest came over Geneva as we came<br>
and then five weeks of drought.  Many<br>
a precipice, every morning I looked up<br>
the valley and saw the frost line rise<br>
higher in sunlight till the fiery power<br>
scorned the visible.  Haze only. Sing<br>

And the sun in scorn.  Some also know<br>
what such a mountain looks like on<br>
a morning in early Thermidor, the grey<br>
of valleys, birds sit on powerlines.  Power.<br>
Program on wavering Essene radios.<br>
What to do with such words, what<br>
is to be done?  Make a vocabulary<br>
no one will ever speak again, or translate<br>
by notariqon, that ampersandy hill<br>
the word drags us up to see: the same sun.<br>
Many original raptures transported a lady<br>
persevering overland while Eros reached<br>
havens of sexy have-nots, chomeuse chic,<br>
battledore and shuttlecock and idleness,<br>
working men will never understand politics.<br>
Justice begins when you deserve nothing,<br>
when you're at the bottom of the world<br>
the end of the line and the cupboard bare_<br>
then you understand what justice is<br>
and what a street is and where it goes<br>
and what it means to stand around at night<br>
wishing only that the moon would speak.<br>
Doom over ordinary markets, domes<br>
stretched wide with copper pleasing,<br>
parchment yielding, razors arguing<br>
many ingenious domestic arrangements,<br>
nightly demands.  What can I do with a word<br>
we understand?  And pinnacle,<br>
what is that?  Just because we see it<br>
fine and white beyond the crappy seeming<br>
of our local guesswork, just because it's there,<br>
can we trust in any magnificence<br>
that dreams us to worship it?  Cabbala,<br>
world needs no redemption,  the grove<br>
at Colonus where a man stops being.<br>
Or just turns into a name.  And once again<br>
to be in your mouth.  All desire<br>
is the same mountain.  The broken record.<br>
A city of death, distinct from where we<br>
actually get mail and take out the garbage,<br>
he found at last you can't live inside desire.<br>
To be in your mouth again and the town quiet!<br>
But the Republicaine band is playing in the rain.<br>
The same again, with many a tower<br>
shaken down by sound alone,  cat yowl<br>
of the smug trombones, the church choir<br>
gets its surplice wet, a wall of sound<br>
with no cranny for silence to get through.<br>
Ridiculous garage!  Vote Communist<br>
on every school wall, forgive the valley<br>
for its tender dialect, snapdragon, nasturtium,<br>
we should have walked down to see the band,<br>
brass shimmering in fluorescent charm,<br>
And know the mountain stands there in the dark.<br>

Impregnable.  Brambles.  By the rarely used<br>
front door of Les Mouflons some nettles grow.<br>
All it needs is a species of pain.  Or a harp<br>
such that the wind moves through it<br>
eliciting intermittent agonies.  Touch me<br>
has a nightmare of its own.  Beaming road<br>
crowned in hot asphalt, the little yellow truck<br>
that brings the mail stands out, bee on a leaf.<br>
It persists in being natural.  As you persist<br>
in being perfect.  Yet not a city<br>
or the way a city is, namelessly accurate,<br>
ancient tongues are spoken, a statue speaks<br>
in empty courtyards, sun-sheen on new ice<br>
and all we have to do is understand<br>
the shade of the fig-tree back onto the tree.<br>
It persists in being natural to talk,<br>
and in all this flood of ruin hold<br>
precisely fixed a word you overheard<br>
when you closed your eyes and listened in.<br>
Where else could it come from but from us?<br>
Is there an animal that could do it for us<br>
or lead us there as we lead rams to slaughter,<br>
charted woe-ways leading from the workplace,<br>
a pain at present unemployed, waiting<br>
for soft tissue?  From the boundaries of the sky<br>
imagined banished.  A table nursed them<br>
and a chairleg gave them milk.<br>
They grew enough to found a city<br>
but never yet enough to leave it and become<br>
the civil pilgrims of unscheduled galaxies.<br>
Milk is perpetual.  Wood loves me.  Rome<br>
builds itself all day long like nettles spreading<br>
shadowless glare around each house door<br>
until there is no hiding from the city<br>
and the hounds snuffle in their fetid doze<br>
and the stream of dream rolls on<br>
collapsing animal and human both<br>
into a valley of engulfed cathedrals,<br>
asphyxiated villages and sunken pines.<br>
And nature is the least of it, and death<br>
is busy with the traveller, strewing his path<br>
with other people's destinies until he bends<br>
hopeless with choosing and never know his own.<br>
I hate these words that fell like brickwork<br>
from a dead religion.  Almost everything<br>
that lives is some sort of an exception.<br>

Strewing the mangled answers of a whole,<br>
whole culture, cacalogue of dwindling<br>
merits, Antinous's slim Bishop's point the smooth<br>
appendicitis region sparked by Turkish war<br>
I knew the names I knew I dreamt<br>
the names I didn't where were you<br>
when I walked down Sixty-sixth Street dreading God<br>
in every armature that started up some car<br>
the rich cruised past me in and who was I?<br>
Delete the pronoun, juicy consonants like Daffy Duck<br>
stick to what I mean, sound-barnacles, slip me<br>
past me.  A branchless tree. A shattered letter<br>
I stand transfixed by, try to piece together<br>
whatever it was they said, units of dissension,<br>
units of conjunction.  It came from everyone<br>
and lies here, a line drawn down<br>
made of a thousand scraps of paper<br>
(wraps rocks), the word from you<br>
reaches my overworking thalamus.<br>
It is a waste, a kind of far fury<br>
makes me grieve to see how little has been said<br>
after all this commerce of the signifiers.<br>
Have what we can have.  The accents<br>
of the ordinary refine the far<br>
ascensions into disorderly white<br>
till I can understand you, yes over<br>
union, what we see away is here<br>
by dint of seeing.  Here ends the lesion.<br>
Fromthis point outward, mystery mutes woe.<br>
Mumble.  Down wet rock we go<br>
(they say I murmur as I ride, alder,<br>
alder, red leaf on my side for a change)<br>
to find the sluiceway where the devil sleeps.<br>
A snoring bugger and a prince of sleeves.<br>
A yellow flower that reminds me someone<br>
waits for us in union with our blood<br>
yet outside the vein, outside the skin<br>
_who can remember bodies in the rain?<br>
A crag within a cleft we'd found in fact<br>
in other words (that far green country,<br>
that isle of capable mistake), be here<br>
at the summit of the dream.  Staircase<br>
laid down in the Third Republic, iron<br>
shouting with the rush or flush of Dranse.<br>
Wherever I stood looked down into me.<br>

Overthrow the limits of the world.  The dead<br>
are images in the thoughts of the living,<br>
n of them, no more.  The infinity of telling<br>
knows everybody's name. (The tellers<br>
in the Bank of Hell keep smug accounts,<br>
crisp paper of their million-dollar bills,<br>
their Rights of Man and of the Citizen,<br>
their dopy hopes.)  We inch by notice.<br>
Overcome by attention, we conquer by speech.<br>
The last one talking has all history in her mouth.<br>
Where I want to be.  Eyes of the wolves<br>
who trot in across the frozen river, golden<br>
eyes surveying patches of the past<br>
known to such observers.  Cut and edit,<br>
process the mnemonic gush. Ruse of splices,<br>
neurons in the fingers weaving<br>
a net to catch nerves.  Edgy Christmas,<br>
gunshots in Astoria, wide bleak avenues<br>
sudden cadenzas of revenge.  The last one<br>
tells everything.  You will have by beauty<br>
the last word, and eke by honestness.<br>
Can I be known for knowing?  Famous<br>
for having looked inside and found a stone<br>
no one had sat down on from the start of time,<br>
a dumb stone, and said nothing but I came,<br>
I saw, I went away?  Rough roads to Dacia<br>
come not from such c=91saring.  I saw the stone.<br>
It sat by Lac Leman the goyim call Geneva,<br>
no spider knew it, the snow sheltered it,<br>
the sun ripened it, no one sat down thereon<br>
since the world began, no snake or weasel,<br>
no man or maid, no angel from the court<br>
of heaven or Alaric fallen.  I am not sure<br>
that even shadow ever touched it.  I found it<br>
and I sat down and looked about<br>
like Whitman in a crowd of working men.<br>
A man has to say something.  A stone<br>
has to be answered.  To be offered.<br>
Here, to the knife in the sky.  Here,<br>
to the hand that comes out of my pocket<br>
and buys back the world.  Here,<br>
to the overcoat the moon wears<br>
but not tonight.  Not tonight at all.<br>

Answer to the riddle.  The stone is seen.<br>
The coat is thrown away never to be<br>
reclaimed.  That's why the night is as it is,<br>
serenaded with unrelenting stars;<br>
we can't hear a thing but what we mean.<br>
By inches.  By insects.  By beasts.  Becomes<br>
is the noisiest music, full of bronze<br>
and brewery.  It is a dwelling-place<br>
full of birds, soapy plaster, oily images,<br>
lariats for mules.  Listening to the radio<br>
we step on delicate little feet<br>
down the rock wall made to break our food.<br>
Our retreat (cleft, cranny, own motion, stop)<br>
is a species of forever that passes fast,<br>
the more it's gone the more that's left to us.<br>
No one is waiting to catch me.  No one<br>
wants me to fall.  Much of life is limestone<br>
carved perhaps with Saint Guerin and ox,<br>
deer, ass, victims of the cute diseases<br>
animals die from that he healeth.<br>
Every valley has its hidden saint. The rock<br>
found me, it told me it was there<br>
in dream, told me it was he or he was it<br>
and woke me with some name I must assume.<br>
What to do with someone dreams of rocks?<br>
Circling disease.  Deep in the labyrinth<br>
an interloping virus breeds and reigns<br>
and cows begin to walk around in loops,<br>
searching the empty center only people know<br>
before death explains it to all comers.<br>
The glanders. The hoof and mouth. The rot of rye.<br>
By vision be distinct from animal<br>
only if the city is different from the river<br>
on which and from which it grew.<br>
Vision is an animal alone.  The joy comes with it<br>
and nothing's lost.  By the millrace<br>
pouring down La Borne I waited for the mail<br>
among the nettles and the hedgehog nests<br>
I waited for the water to find my hands<br>
wherever I hid them, water finds me,<br>
the stone is just a kind of it, we know<br>
how delicate (or do not know) we stand<br>
in balance between beast and flower,<br>
chewing idle on a reed that's mostly silica.<br>
Not what things are made from (things are made<br>
from things) but what they are _ that's animal<br>
enough for me, late afternoon the lazy flies<br>
buzzing round the wineglasses. Some crumbs.<br>
I tore open a new cheese and studied<br>
the sweet unbroken smelly rind.  A thing<br>
in the palace of things.  A gentle dread.<br>
<br>

His work in dwelling.  Vanish what you like<br>
and dwell with smoke.  Up the Sawkill now<br>
billows of snow mist, a fog comes calling,<br>
dwelling, calling, dwelling.  Danube winters<br>
ease late lovers _ supposed to be your spring<br>
(Du bist der Lenz, nach dem ich verlangte)<br>
we work in dwelling.  Being here, the monk said,<br>
is work enough for thee and me. Blessed<br>
they called him, of a Jewish family, Subiaco<br>
maybe, work and pray.  Build an abbey<br>
out of stones, an hour out of grains of wheat,<br>
window me plain glass, the light's enough for me,<br>
up the Sawkill comes the mist, the huge white<br>
sycamores across.  Before The Tempest<br>
Europe knew nothing about America<br>
except what greed proposed; after,<br>
it knew a hollow in the hope of wanting,<br>
a measure of what had to be abandoned,<br>
lost world of paradise, lost pagany,<br>
lost Christianity, all we were to<br>
have is polity.  He who studieth nor<br>
Sycorax nor Setebos (nor cranny nor crest)<br>
can hope for nothing but the weather.<br>
American villains have to feel good<br>
about the crimes they do, we sailed<br>
from Devonshire and never came.<br>
Still in steerage we stink of offered cocks.<br>
Surely America's still there, just past<br>
the bowsprit, over the white cliffs of Gay Head,<br>
over the heavy metal of New Bedford bars.<br>
And their place is not known. Below<br>
varying animals stir torpidly getting<br>
ready for winter, carnivorous anonymous<br>
vagrant energetic strong:  these<br>
are the persons of the drama, reckless<br>
in neediness. (Nothing needs me.)<br>
Foreheads of strolling shoppers<br>
shine, the word is spend, the glow<br>
is animate, and in the rushing afters<br>
torrents of analysis smoke untasted cigarettes.<br>
Restless precepts.  The gleam of that blue thing<br>
I always needed (needs me) clear up there<br>
at the heart of the excavation: a holy place<br>
supposed pre-Aryan, like -nth- in Greek.<br>
Anger to reduce this language<br>
(didn't help him, can it help me,<br>
drowning in the williwaw, quick ponding<br>
sink road, axle in the sunken city<br>
spinning, wheel churn, a wheel<br>
is teaching), language which from those secret<br>
chasms willed to be not clear but revealing<br>
as if there is (there is) a kind of knowing<br>
impossible except when being said.<br>
And then in tumult of disclosure sudden<br>
shift to the left,  speaks itself into being,<br>
welling up of all the only-now-can-be<br>
because you lean back and say sycamore,<br>
tell me the tree, here, not where the hospital<br>
shimmers in heat haze across the Dranse.<br>
Forget France.  The possible is no use.<br>
Say what you don't know and let it be tree.<br>

Vale of Annan.  In you I have studied<br>
that declivity.  Which is divinity.  And one<br>
meaning as long as a year, a gesture, a joke<br>
the rabbi made the Romans never understood.<br>
Dying?  Rising?  Denying?  Enterprising?<br>
A Hansa of the afterlife, a ship with thieves<br>
plundering hell?  Steal the underworld<br>
and set it in the sun and call it flowers?<br>
No wonder winter's such revenge.  I met you<br>
when you were wearing a green skirt<br>
you later said you never owned and never<br>
wore.  The books were good to us<br>
like a chain that slips off the ankle<br>
or a letter falls down the chimney<br>
hardly even scorched.  Who wrote it?<br>
Language.  And we spoke.  And one<br>
majestic River walks beside us<br>
at Clermont, gentry table-land, hidden<br>
garden in the yew hedge and a pale<br>
statue, one more god, proposing<br>
trickeries of perspective up the lawn.<br>
The symmetry of time is terrible,<br>
every instant has its other side, shape<br>
rorschaching the splay of hours<br>
until the echo of every syllable recurs.<br>
Pigeons understand this, and seek towers<br>
to tether their lines of sight to<br>
as they course in and out of the visible<br>
like characters in a novel you forget.<br>
Mostly forget.  Then it all comes back,<br>
what is a tower, who slew the bachelor<br>
while he waited for the maiden at the bower<br>
polishing his ashen bow with swan grease,<br>
The dead hero travels with closed eyes<br>
down every page of the dictionary<br>
waiting for your impossible consent.<br>
<br>

Breath of blood be distant so the word<br>
I speak comes back and smears the window<br>
like a child's soft mouth mumbling the glass<br>
at morning to see what we're up to inside<br>
if that's where we are, the queen of us<br>
snuggling together in the heat of sleep.<br>
Who knows what the weather will be like?<br>
The lands stretch out from the window<br>
in a way different from the door _ a child<br>
has to learn that, what he walks on<br>
is not what he has seen.  No one has seen.<br>
A child on the warpath, a Goth in skins<br>
how matted the ram's fleece can grow<br>
when he sits all day long in the cab<br>
plowing through heathen heavens, these<br>
are not my stars, I'll tell you my horoscope,<br>
I was born in Horsey with the Monkey on my lap<br>
and a lioness was slinking in from mating<br>
and she smelled of pine trees in August noontime,<br>
how could a landscape look like what I know?<br>
Right about now some other nice person<br>
would enjoy a cup of coffee, some oat cakes,<br>
a glass of Falernian wine poured out of a book<br>
_fifty years later he's still drunk on<br>
Roman poetry_ a TV show on penguins,<br>
a brass band marching past the shabby schoolyard<br>
in the mingy rain of a mountain Friday.<br>
Who am it?  It is nice of me to slip<br>
so many things into the chafing dish<br>
of your attention, that gleaming brassy<br>
business with the blue flame underneath<br>
_the heat of legend and a paquebot here<br>
slung to the dock and themselves<br>
gallant down the gangplank, immigrants<br>
to an imaginary continent!<br>
Blueland the Bad!  Every fact you give me<br>
boils in the crucible.  The heat<br>
is from fire, the fire is from holding<br>
firm that fact in mind against<br>
the rough wall of some other, friction<br>
is the only fact of all. Gold in fact<br>
the inevitable consequence of touch.<br>
Touch forever rolls in like a comber<br>
slicking up the sands at Malibu, loud<br>
answers to the ocean platitudes.<br>
Cynic sea, hast seen so much of me!<br>
Bring waters to the ocean and be mum,<br>
waves of chemicals from  high-school labs<br>
bleach the mappy neighborhood where she breathes<br>
swift gossip, she is noon's mother, she is<br>
instrument and orchestra, like those rooms<br>
full of ironwork in Bali and bamboo,<br>
she has brought the ship home, breathed selah upon<br>
the lonely psalms of Baltic exiles,<br>
she is empty, vapors spent, nothing left<br>
but language offered to the circling air!<br>

White mountain crest jewel of blue echo<br>
who knows how old anyone now is, the now<br>
revises us, the clock stands still. Midnight<br>
postcard, old lithocrome, it is Lent now<br>
and we are meant to dust.  Mountain lake,<br>
despair of counsellors, a habit unchanged<br>
from his earliest exaltation, awe at weather,<br>
awe at water.  And in Maine it rained.<br>
So I said to the rock I have found you,<br>
gleams and pegmatite and all, rust<br>
of seasons, all the dust of names on you.<br>
And the rock said You there on high<br>
among the moving, I was not waiting<br>
and it is not remarkable that you came.<br>
I was not lost and you were not looking_<br>
temper the ontology of surprise. It is odd<br>
only that you noticed _ the power is there.<br>
The still language of what is not seen!<br>
And if the solemn habits of the rock<br>
get too much for me, like a bishop<br>
excommunicating a blue macaw,<br>
well, color is theology enough.<br>
Then the subway goes as far as you do<br>
and the harbor is waiting with its terns.<br>
You come out all right, every day,<br>
unless you do something the rock despises.<br>
Then the power drains out of seeing.<br>
Of many sights and many avenues<br>
a word is made, held together by the inside,<br>
sinewed close in some sort of love.<br>
We love a little whatever we give names.<br>
Sounds tell.  We.  You.  Who.  All<br>
this algebra.  The deictic frenzy,<br>
seasoned by untimely revelry I spelled<br>
my day away, morning of bad grammar,<br>
came upon me noon, point your thumb<br>
at life and death I will be calm.<br>
The darkness I import from terror<br>
is calm, a moonless fulgence chafes the wrists<br>
of naked inexpert lovers.  I am them.<br>
I don't trust any of these assumptions<br>
(you call them words, rocks call them moss),<br>
they rust, they rot, they (what's worst)<br>
bore the life out of night's sensate systems<br>
that should be twitching with information<br>
streets under strata reaching all the way<br>
to the bottom of perceiving_ these words<br>
mute meaning.  In the lone glare of sound<br>
we almost sense.  In day we snow.  Descend<br>
further and the crystalline conversation<br>
fuses to amorphous glaze.  Then go down<br>
upon that mountain;  in moist deceiving<br>
none beholds them there.  Nor when.<br>
<br>

It is an Alpine ornament, a scroll<br>
of pure brass unrolled to jazz_<br>
Montreux across the water decorous<br>
druggy and demure_ and it turns out<br>
to be dawn!  The flakes of my music<br>
on the contraire, burn in the sinking<br>
sun we see from the cool stone of Chillon<br>
looking south across the sheen to France<br>
and you, White Mountain, for whom all<br>
our Western culture is some foreplay<br>
before the austere Enlightenment you guard<br>
high on the Milarepa crags of you<br>
temporarily subdued by tours.  The distance<br>
matters. Here Byron sat and estimated<br>
the weight of chains, how hard to drag oneself<br>
to the window too high to see from.<br>
Here there are swans.  I understood the feel<br>
of stone against bone, the flesh a little<br>
fugitive between the real.  Or the star<br>
of sacrifice burns above the lake.  Or the beams<br>
of Antares redden in the south.  Or the dart<br>
slips between the target and the air<br>
in such a way some famous courtesan wakes<br>
in a king's bed her eyes still full of tears.<br>
Through them rough winds contend, silent<br>
leap of seeing, so heap the known with breath<br>
until she speaks.  He turns from the window<br>
and says "It is snowing."  Rapid words<br>
but she does not say them.  Her breath is strong<br>
but silently at home.  We live in voiceless need.<br>
Patterns.  The lightning leaves a letter in the dark<br>
and I have come to teach the quick of reading.<br>
In these solitudes the crowded book of touch<br>
speaks the name of every person.  Don't bother<br>
to remember.  We have no business in the keeps<br>
of such castles _ only for the color of the air<br>
the old roof lets in, the broken ladders, the dry<br>
railing of the tower walkway, steep ways of matter<br>
we drag some years up.  Innocently stone.<br>
At home.  On these cold days the vapour broods<br>
over the chimney like a solid thing,<br>
a blue remark that will not go away. <br>
Over the snow one day of thaw threw sheen_<br>
the old impossible sweetness of such words,<br>
hopeless, unattended.  The secret Strength<br>
of things governs thinking, and what gets thought<br>
(the infinite dome of self- incriminating witnesses)<br>
keeps men happy, gibbering in heaven.<br>
But I want more.  I want the law that inhabits me.<br>
I want the fire and the necklace, the fireplace<br>
where green wood smokes and scorches<br>
ominous magazines and a slim little birch tree<br>
stiffens at the dooryard.  I mean I want what's not<br>
but only will be, and want it till it is.<br>
The natures of the wanting and what's wanted<br>
are just the same_ every body knows that,<br>
in the thousand earths, and stars, and sea,<br>
and stairs and starts and seats and miseries,<br>
Galileos hurrying in sodden cloaks<br>
to chart one more uncompromising star<br>
on a shabby scrap of envelope.<br>
There is only one measure.  We are it.<br>
And if to the harried universal<br>
momentarily articulate nobody<br>
anybody is who minds out loud<br>
the nonstop imaginings that pour out<br>
from silence, it doesn't matter who she is,<br>
there appeared, in the eye's mind,  solitude<br>
willing to listen, would the other side<br>
of vacancy turn out to be a lover?<br>
