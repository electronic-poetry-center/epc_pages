	Heavy Earthly Diadems


	Compact body heavy from falling
	asleep after work.
	Cute sun touches the
	tops of buildings, something falls.

	Magenta dropping blossoms blur,
	heat up, while sore Heather sleeps.

	A plunging comforter, stained, still comforts.
	Open or shut, his body of light.

	Our crick stuck duet hit us
	with 'don't worry,' soft.

	Oshinko


	I sit too close
	to the couple talking

	This learning
	to be alone
	goes on & on
	like rain represented
	by straight black lines

	Daybook
					      for Steven Taylor

i.

So I found an anatomy of aerial bodies:
			      Arms:  azure on a bend O.
The first day back we sleep like athletes as if
			       There's no end in the speech of bees
