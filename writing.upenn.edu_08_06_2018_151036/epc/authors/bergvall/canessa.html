<font size=+2>Kevin Killian</font><P>

Tuesday, October 14, 7:30 p.m.<br>
AT CANESSA PARK<br>
708 Montgomery at Columbus <P>


This is the first San Francisco appearance of the dynamic Caroline
Bergvall, one of the United Kingdom's most interesting new writers.
Ever
since her appearance at last year's "<A HREF="../../documents/assembling/index.html">Assembling Alternatives</A>"
conference in
New Hampshire, where she made a huge hit, we have wanted to bring her
here
to the Bay Area.  Now here she is, live, in person, at Canessa Park.
She
is the author of Eclat (Sound & Language, 1996) and teaches
performance
writing at Dartington College of the Arts in Devon (England). <P>

"So,
what is
Performance Writing not?  Is Performance Writing not writing?  Is it
writing which performs not writes?  Is it not performance which
writes?
But then does writing not perform?  And when does writing not
perform?  And
what kind of not performance are we talking about?  Is it not
performance
to write or is it not writing to not perform?"  Don't miss this
chance to
see and meet La Bergvall, the woman everyone's talking about, for
soon you
will be too!
