            <p align="justify"><font size="2"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I love James Schuyler&rsquo;s poetry, its effortlessness and  grace, its sound, its thick and at times gnarly descriptions. A palpable sense  of irreality is everywhere present in it. His poems combine the attention of an  ethnographic account with the charm of a great dinner guest. Add to this a  private reading of the physical world imprinted on his nervous system. In his  hyper-real descriptions colors shift; the words shimmer. The &ldquo;violet sea&rdquo;  verges on the violent, there&rsquo;s a deeper cold behind the &ldquo;gold and chilly&rdquo;  weather. </font></strong></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>In one sense &ldquo;February&rdquo; is composed as  a painstakingly specific catalog of discrete images. Each line is a surprise,  delighting in the pleasures of coincidence, like &ldquo;the pink of five tulips/ at  five p.m.&rdquo; Gradually we progress through the city day to the dust inside the  tulip, to the shape of the tulip, the container the tulip is in (a glass), and  the container the glass is in (this day).&nbsp;  The poem draws us from </strong></font></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1) the impalpability of the discrete  units of matter; the fuzz of memory; the microscopic material of being; the  &ldquo;dust&rdquo; inside the tulip; </strong><br />
              <br />
                  <strong>2) to the shape of the tulip; its form  (seemingly almost a platonic form&mdash;an ideal form&mdash;and yet here it is both  symbolic and specific) </strong><br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>3) to the container; the context we can  &ldquo;place&rdquo; it in; the context of the day, as the poet records the shifting of the  light; </strong><br />
                  <br />
                <strong>4) to the  container of the poem, which can contain more than the day; the poetic tension  between the beginning of matter&mdash;the baby being jogged on a hip&mdash;and the end of  matter&mdash;the dust we become. The beauty of the tulip may draw us to observe it  but inside it we see a reflection of what we ourselves are made of, just as we  may see an image of our own childhood when we look in someone else&rsquo;s window.</strong></font></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&ldquo;February&rdquo;  is not a tranquil Romantic recollection; it is active observation that creates  the effect of recollection. As David Kalstone has said, Schuyler &ldquo;exchanges a  syntax of memory and judgment for a syntax of simultaneity. He uncouples his  sentences, so that the electric spark must jump from noun to noun, and from  event to event, no matter how disparate or seemingly unrelated.&rdquo; The gaps  between his lines give us the experience of the passage of time, a verbal  time-lapse photography. Schuyler is a watcher. If you look out the window long  enough you can actually &ldquo;see&rdquo; time pass as the light and colors of the world  shift. In the first poem of his first book, John Ashbery wrote &ldquo;Everything has  a schedule, if you can find out what it is.&rdquo; And one might say that in this  poem &ldquo;February&rdquo; (the second poem of Schuyler&rsquo;s first book, <em>Freely Espousing</em>), he does the work to disclose this invisible  schedule, revealing the seemingly random syntax of the physical world.</strong></font></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>
			</strong></font></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>This world  as he presents it is both reassuring and unstable. The &ldquo;day before March 1st&rdquo;  is not always February 28th and by not naming it&mdash;but naming what is  next to it&mdash;he draws attention to this hinge of seasonal, temporal change, this  &ldquo;leap.&rdquo; The poem is partly about this passage, getting over the hump of winter,  as the truck disappears over the hump of the hill, or the speaker &ldquo;can&rsquo;t get  over&rdquo; his latest observation. And in this simple gesture nature, commerce, and  human reason are intertwined. It is this interconnectedness that makes  Schuyler&rsquo;s poems reassuring in spite of the instability of their surface. And  yet, reality is never as real as it is in a Schuyler poem. One has the sense of  events and words being brought together out of necessity, to conduct a vision,  giving the apparent randomness of living a sense of coherence and even  inevitability.</strong></font></font></p>
