              Reading James Schuyler's <i>Collected Poems</i> this summer, just 
              out this June, is better than vacationing at the shore, or mountain 
              retreat; in fact it is better than anywhere one could imagine. There, 
              or rather here in his book, one visits with the imagination of a 
              great poet whose art transforms us as it informs our relationship 
              within our surroundings only to discover words are the landscape 
              in which we want most to go. Modesty, fortunately, is not one of 
              Mr. Schuyler's virtues and the world he artfully presents, as we 
              are keenly aware in every line, is neither his nor ours, even when 
              the recognition of the real in his observations is so stunning we 
              can only acquiesce. <br>
              <br>
              Objects are never as real in life as they appear in Schuyler's poems. 
              One might say Schuyler is an objective surrealist interpolating 
              flat reportage with hyper-descriptive elements.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

              as though his &quot;outside&quot; is the reading of an afterimage 
              flashed upon the optic nerve creating a neurasthenic tableau whose 
              colors shift, and in this polarization or synesthesia we find world 
              and ourselves impressed (nailed down, taken aboard) in his process. 
              In this activity &#150; the need to capture &#150; Schuyler is an 
              ecstatic, perhaps even a religious thinker, though he is neither 
              overtly moral nor pious. In these visions of excess, Schuyler is 
              never a tourist. He is, however, profoundly genuine in his arduous 
              humility to get it right.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

              wonderfully, for us, in our significant need for refreshment which 
              he quietly indulges, getting it right means he can run on to &quot;camp&quot; 
              where fun &quot;<i>is something more than beer and skittles, and 
              the something more is a whole lot better than beer and skittles!</i>&quot; 
              But his sense of whimsy, like that of John Ashbery, can also reveal 
              that life in a funhouse is anything but fun. The nonsense in his 
              poems can sometimes peek through to expose nature (and social orders 
              alike) as empowered, terrifying and indifferent.<br>
              <br>
              When Schuyler reviewed his lifetime friend Fairfield Porter's work 
              in Art News in 1967 he wrote: &quot;<i>The quotidian image is transfigured 
              to pure paint.</i>&quot; Replace &quot;language&quot; for &quot;paint&quot; 
              and the same can be said of the transfiguration Schuyler enacts 
              within his own medium. The title of the review &quot;Immediacy Is 
              the Message&quot; is telling as well, as Schuyler is the master 
              of the quick take. However it is more complicated than &quot;first 
              thought best thought,&quot; for Schuyler is a known fiddler and 
              would sometimes take up to a year tinkering with a poem &#150; getting 
              it right. The surface of his poems has only an illusion of immediate 
              and effortless description. His poems, like ethnographic accounts, 
              read from a subject-position both inside and outside of the human 
              activities and &quot;weather&quot; they track. And although a case 
              can be made that he himself was an outsider, we continually find 
              ourselves adopted within the natural and normative social intricacies 
              he records as familiar. We know that James Schuyler suffered profoundly 
              in his adult life, he was hospitalized several times for schizophrenia 
              and in many ways, I feel, his work is that of a solitaire, recording 
              the light outside a window &#150; guest room, hospital room etc. 
              You don't have to go digging. It's in the poems. His vivid rendering 
              of the world is born out of a necessity to cohere, not merely for 
              embellishment but as an act of sanity. Yet he is not simply inventing 
              a locus for himself in his poems. The act is, in fact, far more 
              sophisticated &#150; it is description as event. An event which 
              includes potentially everyone: the ominous cabby, a nurse, a failed 
              lover from high school, a newspaper boy, friends and family alike. 
              All have a place within Schuyler's &quot;camp,&quot; which remains 
              complicated and thick. The event of the poem is a promise of salvation 
              divested within the infinite possibility of forms. <br>
              <br>
              In his book of essays &quot;<i>The Interpretation of Culture</i>&quot; 
              the anthropologist Clifford Geertz illuminates the role of ethnography 
              as &quot;<i>thick description.</i>&quot; In Schuyler's case, we 
              might substitute poet for ethnographer in the following quote: &quot;<i>What 
              the </i>[poet] <i>is in fact faced with is a multiplicity of complex 
              conceptual structures, many of them superimposed upon or knotted 
              into one another, which are at once strange, irregular, and inexplicit, 
              and which he must contrive somehow first to grasp and then to render: 
              incoherencies, suspicious emendations, and tendentious commentaries. 
              And this is true at the most down-to-earth, jungle field work levels 
              of his activity: interviewing informants, observing rituals, eliciting 
              kin terms, censusing households,</i> [describing them] <i>not in 
              conventionalized graphs of sound but in transient examples of shaped 
              behavior.&quot; Indeed, his entire opus is full of &quot;transient 
              examples of shaped behavior,</i>&quot; never &quot;<i>conventionalized 
              graphs of sound.</i>&quot; Ethnography is not so far off, considering 
              the subject matter of Schuyler's poems, especially the long poems.

              Not unlike Whitman, Schuyler believed that &quot;<i>a freedom which 
              excludes is less than free.&quot;</i> (&quot;Immediacy Is the Message&quot;), 
              and he has invented a form wherein we are free to come and go as 
              we partake of the terms of its telling. His technique to create 
              an open field was never more telling than when, in an important 
              gesture near the end of his life, Schuyler came out in 1988 to give 
              his first public reading. The line outside of the DIA Foundation 
              was four abreast and was over a block long comprised of life-long 
              devotees and younger readers. In short all the various clans turned 
              out to participate in the masterful space of that event.<br>
              <br>
              I can't imagine anyone not being completely thrilled to own this 
              edition of the <i>Collected Poems</i>. The cover is a portrait of 
              Mr. Schuyler, reading in his room at the Chelsea Hotel, by Darragh 
              Park (who, along with Raymond Foye and Thomas Carey is an editor 
              of this volume). My only complaint is that I was also hoping to 
              find fugitive poems from his career. The good news is that the present 
              volume is replete with 90 pages of &quot;<i>Last Poems,</i>&quot; 
              which are remarkable. It is hard to pick favorites as they are all 
              first rate and as good as anything he has written &#150; outrageous, 
              unconventional, particular, angry, disappointed, kind and knowing. 
              A significant treat. The long poem &quot;Hymn to Life<i>&quot;</i> 
              is presented here for the first time with its glorious long lines 
              unbroken, which to my mind does make a difference. Also all of the 
              poems from &quot;<i>The Home Book</i>&quot; are included. The most 
              striking aspect of reading through the Collected Poems is the variousness 
              of his craft, from short staccato lines to luxurious run-on sentences. 
              The entire book creates an almost seamless vision of life as it 
              is and as we see ourselves in it from a distance. To reread Schuyler's 
              poems is a rehearsal for an event we need always to possess &#150; 
              the promise of artistic excellence. </font></p>
