            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
              <font size="2">This spring we paid a visit to Charles North at his 
              spacious apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side to discuss his 
              relationship with the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet James Schuyler 
              and his thoughts on Schuyler's poetry. North, Poet-in-Residence 
              at Pace University in New York, has published eight striking and 
              ingenious books of poetry that have earned him an ardent following, 
              and <i>No Other Way</i>, a remarkable book of selected prose that 
              includes three essays on Schuyler. In one of these, North wrote, 
              &quot;[Schuyler] continually reminds one of all that poems can be 
              and do, all that can happen between the start of a poem and its 
              conclusion.&quot; </font></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
              Charles North's poetry, Schuyler himself once wrote, &quot;His joy 
              in words, and the things words adumbrate, is infectious: we catch 
              a contagion of enlightenment. To me, he is the most stimulating 
              poet of his generation.&quot; North met and befriended the psychologically 
              troubled Schuyler in the early 1970s. Together they edited <i>Broadway: 
              A Poets and Painters Anthology</i> in 1979 and <i>Broadway II</i> 
              in 1989.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surrounded 
              by portraits of North and his friends (many painted by his wife 
              Paula) and other memorabilia (including the original copy of &quot;Light 
              from Canada,&quot; a poem that Schuyler dedicated to North), we 
              felt somewhat intimidated, but also certain that we had come to 
              the right place. North, for his part, was all easiness, plying us 
              with coffee and sweets as he welcomed us into a comfortable sitting 
              room.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Justin Jamail: When did you first read Schuyler?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charles 
              North: My guess is that I didn't read him until I took Kenneth [Koch]'s 
              New School Workshop in the winter of 1966 &#150; which is when I 
              started writing poetry myself. He introduced us to all these poets 
              I'd never heard of, and Jimmy was one of them. The books that I 
              read first were <i>May 24th or So</i> and, later, <i>Freely Espousing</i>. 
              <i>Freely Espousing </i>came out in '68 or '69. I'm pretty sure 
              those were the only things available by him except for those limited 
              edition collaborations (Tiber Press?) Jimmy, Kenneth, John Ashbery, 
              and Frank O'Hara each did with a painter. So it was through Kenneth 
              that I came to know of Jimmy. Really, everything I did with respect 
              to poetry at the beginning was a result of Kenneth's teaching.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              Did you already know of Koch at the time of taking the New School 
              class or did you find him by chance?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Neither, quite. I had taken a master's degree in English at Columbia 
              and had kept in touch with my advisor, John Unterecker, who was 
              himself a poet (and was also in the process of doing a biography 
              of Hart Crane). I had just begun to be interested in poetry, and 
              Unterecker recommended Kenneth, his colleague at Columbia, who moonlighted 
              at the New School. I kept putting it off &#150; probably out of 
              sheer insecurity &#150; but finally did enroll in Kenneth's poetry 
              workshop, and it turned out to be the last time that he taught there.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew 
              McCarron: Did the poems you read of Schuyler's in that workshop 
              make an impression?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              I'm not sure whether we actually read the poems or whether Kenneth 
              just mentioned Schuyler as someone to read &#150; or whether I heard 
              about him casually as a result of conversations with Kenneth or 
              other people I then met. But I loved his work, and after discovering 
              <i>Freely Espousing</i>, I read it until it was practically falling 
              apart! I did the same with Tony Towle's book <i>North</i> (which 
              had nothing to do with <i>me</i>). Somehow, those were the two books 
              that first attracted me. Of course, I was soon fascinated by the 
              poems of Ashbery, O'Hara and Koch as well, along with some younger 
              poets Tibor de Nagy was publishing in chapbooks &#150; that was 
              where I first came upon Joe Ceravolo, for example. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              Do you remember when you first met Schuyler?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              I do, partly because I was so nervous! The story's a little roundabout. 
              In the spring of 1970, I showed up towards the end of a poetry workshop 
              Tony Towle was giving at the Poetry Project (where, by the way, 
              I also met Paul Violi). We hit it off, and Tony gave me a great 
              deal of encouragement. Soon after, I showed him a poem I had dedicated 
              to Schuyler called &quot;Lights&quot; &#150; it's in my first book, 
              <i>Elizabethan &amp; Nova Scotian Music</i> &#150; and Tony, who 
              had known Jimmy for some years, sent it to him. I was very shy about 
              it all. Anyway, a few months later, out of the blue, the wonderful 
              poem &quot;Light From Canada&quot; (which I still think is one of 
              Jimmy's best) came in the mail with a dedication to me, a gloss 
              explaining an allusion to a line of O'Hara's, and a note saying 
              &quot;Let me return the compliment.&quot; Needless to say I was 
              thrilled. About a year later, again via Tony, I met Schuyler at 
              a party in Morris Golde's apartment in the West Village. Morris 
              was a businessman who was very involved with contemporary music 
              and the arts in general. I think, though I'm not positive, that 
              this was the same party where I rubbed shoulders with Leonard Bernstein, 
              and in addition had the experience of seeing him dancing lip to 
              lip with some guy, which for me, innocent as I was then, was a shocker. 
              I don't remember who actually introduced me to Jimmy, but I do remember 
              that I was almost literally dumbfounded and very embarrassed about 
              that afterwards. Later, I remembered that he had said practically 
              nothing, either. (Did he say, tongue-in-cheek, &quot;Finally,&quot; 
              or did I make that up?) As I've said before, one of my lasting regrets 
              is that I didn't know him when he was younger and healthier. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              Did you know anything about <i>him</i> at the time? You knew his 
              poetry, but did you know about his circumstances?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Just in general terms. Actually, one spring, '71 or '72, Anne Waldman 
              asked my wife, Paula, and me if we would be willing to spend the 
              summer with Jimmy at 49 South Main Street (in Southampton, L.I.); 
              Fairfield Porter and his family, with whom Jimmy lived, would be 
              in Maine for the summer and Jimmy wasn't going with them. We had 
              already heard about Jimmy's breakdowns and such, but, after some 
              agonizing, we decided we couldn't <i>not </i>do it. As it happened, 
              it fell through at the last minute, when Ruth Kligman, whom Anne 
              described to us as &quot;very resilient&quot; (she was the girl 
              friend of Jackson Pollock who survived the car crash) decided to 
              do it. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              I wonder how that would have gone.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              God knows. Well, you know, Ron Padgett and his family had a famously 
              bad experience living with Jimmy during one of his breakdowns. So 
              I'm just as happy it didn't happen. I never saw him at his worst. 
              When he used to come over for dinner here in the late '70s he was 
              often silent and looked unwholesome, to put it mildly. He would 
              play steadily with his false teeth with his tongue &#150; at least 
              that's what it looked like. But he never acted crazy. Once after 
              dinner &#150; I don't know whether he was especially tired or didn't 
              feel well, or what &#150; he asked if he could sleep over. We were 
              a little nervous about it, especially as Jill, my daughter, was 
              very young at the time, but it was already late and of course we 
              couldn't just turn him out. After a quiet night &#150; for him anyway 
              &#150; he left in the morning. I do remember him requesting eggnog 
              more than once when he was here for dinner in the winter, and my 
              going downstairs in the snow to get him a quart, which he drank 
              straight down. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              How did the dinners first come about? Did you correspond with him?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Not correspond, we lived too near each other, but I had gotten to 
              know him by then. Paula and I just thought it was a nice idea. I 
              had visited him regularly during the time he was at the Lincoln 
              Square Home for Adults (where he was by far the youngest resident) 
              on 74th Street and Broadway. Darragh Park and I were his main, if 
              not his only, visitors there. Darragh was an extremely faithful 
              friend. In fact, I recall once entering the place and being addressed 
              as Mr. Park. Actually &#150; this isn't what you asked but it's 
              related &#150; when I visited Jimmy during his time at the Payne 
              Whitney Clinic, he would complain that so few came to see him. To 
              tell the truth, it was sometimes exhausting to be with him, especially 
              in these circumstances, and especially when he was next to silent. 
              Visits were a mixed blessing in other ways too. I saw him at the 
              Allerton &quot;Hotel&quot; before he moved into the Chelsea, and 
              that was one of the most depressing places I have ever been in in 
              my life.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              JJ: There is a footnote in the diaries referencing Ann Dunne's remarks 
              on the squalid conditions in that apartment.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Oh, I didn't know she visited him there; I didn't think anybody 
              did! It was pretty horrifying, the fleabag of fleabags. His room 
              consisted of a bed, on which, at least the few times I saw him there, 
              he lay surrounded by a sea of dirty laundry that reached just about 
              to the height of the bed. And of course the smell was pretty bad. 
              Moving to the Chelsea, with the help of his generous friends, I'm 
              sure changed his life.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              There's a tradition of the crazy poet &#150; John Clare, Robert 
              Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and so forth &#150; how do you think Schuyler 
              relates to this tradition?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Well, I don't like to think of him &#150; I don't think of him &#150; 
              as a &quot;crazy poet.&quot; I've never found his poetry crazy; 
              he managed just about invariably to spot what shouldn't be published 
              and kept it to himself. I saw an early manuscript of <i>The Morning 
              of the Poem</i>, and I was very happy when the book came out to 
              see that he had omitted a few poems that were really over the top. 
              Of course like Clare and Cowper, he is exquisitely sensitive to 
              things other poets don't write about. I guess you could call his 
              attention to flowers obsessive, or even a displacement of feeling. 
              But unlike, say, Plath and Lowell, he rarely refers openly to his 
              mental disturbances, and when he does, it's always in a matter-of-fact 
              way, nothing histrionic or exhibitionistic. That's what makes his 
              Payne Whitney poems so admirable &#150; it's reporting about insanity, 
              in a low-keyed way, not the insanity itself.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              It's always creeping in kind of the corners of Schuyler's poems. 
              It's never central.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Maybe you see more of it than I do. Or maybe I don't want to see 
              it. That's possible too. I remember talking about Jimmy's poetry 
              with my friends, like Tony, and marveling at the clarity, delicacy, 
              brilliant contrariness, and other remarkable qualities of the writing 
              of this person whose life and person (almost helpless dependency 
              on others, overweight, etc.) were often the extreme opposites of 
              those. I guess we all know about the flip side of obsessive and 
              compulsive behavior, at least in artists. But again, I've never 
              found the poems themselves &quot;crazy.&quot; In fact, quite the 
              opposite.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              There's not a smoking gun.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              No, but I don't really think the subject comes up via the poetry. 
              On top of all this, and again apart from his life and whatever megalomaniacal 
              behavior appeared in his breakdowns, as a poet he's so modest. He 
              makes such a point of saying he just wants to &quot;see and say.&quot; 
              You know, he never published that &quot;immodest&quot; poem I quoted 
              in my piece &quot;No Other Way,&quot; where he says, in effect, 
              that though people think he's modest, he's &quot;a great poet. No 
              other way.&quot; I'm pretty sure that was one of the poems he deleted 
              from the <i>Morning of the Poem</i> manuscript. I don't think, by 
              the way, giving way momentarily to the impulse to tout himself, 
              privately or publicly, is in any way crazy. In my experience, we 
              all feel the same way, at least in our heart of hearts, no matter 
              how quiet we are about it.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              Any thoughts on his prose?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              The prose I knew back then consisted of a few things that appeared 
              in the Paris Review and were later collected in <i>The Home Book</i>, 
              which Trevor Winkfield edited, and the novel <i>Alfred and Guinevere</i>, 
              which I had heard about and found (and loved) at a used book store 
              (inscribed to &quot;Chester&quot; &#150; Kallman, I'm sure). <i>What's 
              For Dinner</i> came later. The only diary material I knew (and thought 
              exquisite) was what was included in his books of poems, like the 
              section in <i>The Crystal Lithium</i>. I had seen a few little art 
              reviews in Art News, but I didn't really know his art writing &#150; 
              or his letters which are about to come out, edited by Bill Corbett. 
              And now we see that all along he was at the center of prose beauty! 
              Imagine! </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              Are there parallels between his fiction and poetry?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Yes, but more so, I'd venture, with respect to the diaries, letters, 
              art writing, where he's as brilliantly attentive and specific as 
              he is in his poems. He's always seeing more than most others see, 
              and saying in a better way than most others say. I have been struck 
              by the childhood experiences and even dialogue that pop up unexpectedly 
              in poems &#150; you know: &quot;Put that down, dear&quot; &#150; 
              but apart from some connection to <i>Alfred and Guinevere</i>, which 
              is about kids, I don't know that I have much to say about that.</font></p>

              Let's return to his visits. What would you speak about at dinner? 
              Poetry?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Never, as I recall. Actually, he was rarely talkative at those dinners 
              &#150; more so when I met him for lunch in Chelsea. Sometimes with 
              Trevor Winkfield too. Maybe he just relaxed when he was here, since 
              it was, after all, a family atmosphere, and I think that was a big 
              part of what he liked about coming. Of course Paula's a wonderful 
              cook too, and Jimmy liked to eat. At the lunches there was almost 
              no shoptalk, though we did gossip &#150; though nothing like the 
              &quot;dishing&quot; that he and Darragh engaged in on a regular 
              basis. I remember being astonished once at his telling me that not 
              only did he intensely dislike the poetry of one of our most distinguished 
              living (then) poets, who could be assumed to be a colleague if not 
              necessarily a close friend, but that he intensely disliked the person! 
              He could also be extremely nice, appreciative, and generous with 
              his praise. He was, as I'm sure you've heard, extraordinarily witty, 
              in conversation as well as on the page, and another regret I have 
              is that I didn't receive more than a handful of his fabulous letters. 
              Wait till everyone sees them. Oh, a tiny example of his wit. He 
              wrote a blurb for my first big book, <i>Leap Year</i>, which I was 
              very proud of, but which no one ever saw, since Kulchur Press, rather 
              than printing the blurb on the books, printed them on a cheap insert, 
              which of course always got lost. Anyway, when <i>The Year of the 
              Olive Oil </i>was in production, I asked him if the blurb could 
              be reprinted. He said of course, then proposed a slight reordering 
              of what he had originally written, then wrote to me that I was free 
              to use either the new or &quot;the King James version.&quot; </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              Why did you invite him to dinner?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Well, partly because we knew it was important to him. He ate regularly 
              at the homes of a few other people, too, Katie and George Schneeman's, 
              for example. Certainly I wasn't a close friend. I don't really know 
              how close he was with those friends who were closer to him than 
              I was. But I know he liked families, and he liked comfortable situations, 
              from sitting snugly in a taxi for a long ride uptown to simply being 
              taken care of. And over the years a number of people cared for him 
              in one way or another, from the Porters with whom he lived for so 
              many years, to those who paid for his various apartments, to his 
              various assistants. It's not that we weren't friends of a sort &#150; 
              certainly we had a poetry connection &#150; and he did ask me, at 
              one point, to be his literary executor along with Darragh Park (which, 
              after agonizing about, I declined. At the time I was overwhelmed 
              by everything to do with my father's Alzheimer's disease, and I 
              couldn't see past that. Jimmy was very nice about it.) Nathan Kernan, 
              in his exemplary biographical notes for his edition of Jimmy's diaries, 
              included Paula and me among Jimmy's &quot;good friends.&quot; I 
              suppose it's possible that, for a time, we were, but it never really 
              seemed like that. He wasn't so easy to be with. I'll tell you an 
              anecdote: John Ashbery was having a party and Jimmy invited Paula 
              and me to go with him. We were supposed to go down to the Chelsea, 
              pick Jimmy up, and then walk over to Ashbery's. Well, either Jimmy 
              had the time wrong, or he was too eager, because we got there an 
              hour and a half early! I hardly knew John and had been very much 
              looking forward to seeing his apartment, and I was very embarrassed 
              when John said, rather bluntly, come back later. Another time, at 
              a party at Barbara Guest's studio, Jimmy was drunk &#150; even though 
              he was taking antabuse &#150; and as he was leaving he said he would 
              write me a poem. He stood there at the elevator and wrote and wrote 
              and wrote and finally handed me a piece of paper covered in wavy 
              lines &#150; no words whatsoever. I guess I should have taken it 
              in stride, but I remember feeling awful and embarrassed for Jimmy. 
              So I wish I had seen him the way his old friends had, and as I think 
              Tony Towle did in the early days and Larry Fagin and others too, 
              when the wit and charm I've now seen in his writing were evident 
              in person. When I met him he was already thick and medicated, and 
              when he came over in the winter he'd wear this big sheepskin thing 
              and had long, very matted hair. I know he attracted attention on 
              the street. He described himself at this point as looking like Buffalo 
              Bill's grandmother [laughs], which I think is absolutely wonderful, 
              but not so far off. </font></p>

              Not a lot of people who knew him at his lowest also knew him in 
              the '80s after things started to improve. Was there a sense at the 
              time in the '70s that it was only a matter of time until he improved?

              It was a surprise, at least to me. Again, I'm sure having someone 
              to take care of his food staples, cash, laundry, as well as poetry 
              business, on a daily basis must have helped immensely. He clearly 
              loved having his &quot;assistants,&quot; as he called them &#150; 
              Eileen Myles, Helena Hughes, Tom Carey, etc. &#150; and grew very

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Let's see, he was at the Chelsea already &#150; right? Well no&#133; 
              maybe we began talking about it when he was at the Lincoln Square 
              Hotel For Adults? [CN leafs through chronology from diaries] Let's 
              see, yes I think it was there. I'm pretty sure I was the one who 
              brought it up. Back in the late '60s he had put together this one-shot 
              mimeo magazine called <i>49 South</i> (named for the Porters' address 
              in Southampton) which I had a poem in, and which everyone had fond 
              memories of. I think I said, why not do a second one. Possibly he 
              suggested our doing it together, I don't really remember, but in 
              any case, he wasn't in any condition to do much of the work. We 
              decided to have one poem or one drawing from a number of poets and 
              artists we both admired, and somehow the magazine became a quasi-anthology. 
              We were both living on Broadway, and Paula's cover drawing is a 
              Broadway scene out of our apartment window. Jimmy and I both got 
              a kick &#150; I can still hear his slow chuckle &#150; out of the 
              little invitation we composed, which read, &quot;Send us your best 
              unpublished poem (or drawing).&quot; </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              Do you see Schuyler's influence in younger poets these days?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              I do, but it isn't always a positive influence. As you know, any 
              original artist is dangerous to imitate, Schuyler probably more 
              than most. His poems can <i>appear</i> to be so plain, and of course 
              plainness is not what most good poetry has going for it. As I've 
              written before about the so-called New York School, imitating Ashbery, 
              Koch, O'Hara, Denby, etc., comes each with its special pitfalls. 
              Then again, I'm sure I've taken something from all the aforementioned!</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              People have compared Schuyler to Bishop. Do you think it's just 
              a coincidence of sensibility or a direct influence of one upon the 
              other?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Both among the experts in poetic line. I'm not sure. She, of course, 
              wasn't that much older than he was. I know he admired her work and 
              she admired his. My guess is it was mostly a coincidence of sensibility. 
              Actually, Jimmy was the one who suggested that I send her a copy 
              of my first book, <i>Elizabethan &amp; Nova Scotian Music</i>, because 
              he knew I admired her poetry. One of the things she wrote back was 
              how much she liked his poems, and how rare it was to find good love 
              poems any more. That's interesting, isn't it. Though I admire them, 
              Jimmy's love poems are not my favorite part of his oeuvre. Of course 
              Bishop in general is so much tighter and more formal, but they do 
              deserve to be spoken of in the same breath.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              Also, they both have fairly broad appeal.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Well, I know Bishop's appeal transcends party lines, though interestingly, 
              when I published a review of <i>Geography II</i> in the Poetry Project 
              Newsletter &#150; the first or second critical piece I had ever 
              done &#150; I remember people around the Project giving me strange 
              looks. She was the Establishment back then, and for some that was 
              that. Actually, that's probably still the case in certain circles. 
              Schuyler's appeal, at least as I see it, is a lot narrower. Sad 
              to say, it will probably remain so, as much as you and I and many 
              of those we know would like to think otherwise. As I tried to point 
              out in that piece I wrote on Vendler's NY Review piece on Jimmy, 
              I don't think there's enough for the regular critic of poetry to 
              sink enough teeth into. Critics aren't fond of just pointing and 
              saying, &quot;Isn't that remarkable!&quot; which in the case of 
              Jimmy's work and that of some others is the best service one can 
              perform for readers.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM:

              Speaking of poetic recognition, let's talk about Schuyler's winning 
              of the Pulitzer Prize in 1981. Do you recollect how it affected 
              him?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              No, not really. Well, it certainly helped his reputation. And I 
              bet Helen Vendler wouldn't have written about him if he hadn't won. 
              Public recognition has a way of snowballing. <br>
              <br>
              JJ: Did it help more to have won the prize or to be associated with 
              Farrar, Straus?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              I'm sure they both helped. How many do you imagine were even aware 
              that <i>The Home Book</i> existed, let alone that it was published 
              by Kenward Elmslie's tiny Z Press?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              The reason we brought up the idea of Schuyler having broad appeal 
              is that eight years after the Pulitzer he gave that famous reading 
              at DIA art foundation. All those people showed up&#133; the line 
              wrapped around the block, etc. Ron Padgett said when he first knew 
              Jimmy he though he knew maybe 80 percent of the people who liked 
              his work, but at the reading (forty years later) he felt he knew 
              maybe 5 percent. Darragh, describing the same phenomenon, recently 
              referred to Jimmy's following as a &quot;complicated cult following.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              CN: Yeah. I think Darragh's characterization is accurate. And I 
              feel the way Ron feels. Speaking of which, I haven't heard much 
              talk about Frank O'Hara in a long time. Maybe &quot;complicated 
              cult&quot; is the true ideal, as long as &quot;complicated&quot; 
              has some connotations of quantity as well as quality. In other words, 
              no question of &quot;major&quot; poets, but <i>tant mieux.</i> The 
              DIA reading was the most thrilling I think I've ever been to, the 
              loudest applause I've ever heard &#150; thunderous. And again, the 
              line around the block was a surprise. DIA itself was a pretty big 
              deal, though, wasn't it? There would have been an art world base 
              audience, in addition to those who were already fans of Jimmy, and 
              as I recall, DIA did some good publicity. I don't mean to be a wet 
              blanket. I would love to think that Jimmy was the sole draw, and 
              that he is now beloved of everyone who reads. </font></p>

              exciting nonetheless, for Jimmy too. You know, after having declined 
              for so long, he quickly, not surprisingly, developed a taste for

              Not sure. They were so different. Jimmy does have that very nice 
              poem about Auden, but that has more to do with the person than the 
              poetry. Auden was such a formalist, and &quot;social commentator,&quot; 
              and Jimmy so immediate and even casual, seeing and jotting down. 
              People don't mention it much, but Jimmy did do some subtle things 
              with meter, for example, organizing some of his wonderful short 
              poems in 3- and sometimes 4-beat lines, like &quot;Salute&quot; 
              and &quot;Buried at Springs.&quot; And of course no one else wrote,

              I'm all admiration &#150; though I've never felt they are Jimmy 
              at his best. Still, their courage and straight talk is inspiring, 
              as is his calling himself &quot;Jim the jerk,&quot; and broaching 
              the big question: &quot;What is a poem, anyway?&quot; </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              Can you tell us about some poems you've had change of heart about?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              It's not so much a change of heart about particular poems as an 
              increased sense of overall strengths and weaknesses. Yes, there's 
              a good bit of preciousness, and a good many slight (though often 
              charming anyway) poems. Yes, like everyone else he repeats himself, 
              but yes, the poems I used to think are wonderful are still wonderful, 
              and there are so many of them. <i>Freely Espousing</i> alone has 
              &quot;February,&quot; &quot;December,&quot; &quot;A Man in Blue,&quot; 
              the Dante sestina, &quot;Hudson Ferry,&quot; &quot;April and its 
              Forsythia,&quot; &quot;Salute,&quot; Buried at Springs, &quot;Going&quot; 
              (one of the great neglected ones), &quot;Earth's Holocaust,&quot; 
              and others I'm forgetting at the moment. <i>The Crystal Lithium</i> 
              has many more. All his books have wonderful things in them, including 
              the miscellany of early stuff Trevor Winkfield put together, <i>The 
              Home Book</i>. I've always felt that if O'Hara is an &quot;I do 
              this I do that&quot; poet, Schuyler is &quot;I see this I see that.&quot; 
              In his great lyric poems, so many of which are quite short, it's 
              as though one thing is happening after the other but they're not 
              really. It's treating space as time. It's really very much like 
              painting.</font></p>

              What's Schuyler's most undeservedly neglected work?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              To me he is seriously neglected in general. I hope I'm wrong, but 
              I believe we get fooled by the fact that everybody we know loves 
              his work. It's not only that those we know are poets, but that the 
              poets we know are the ones who happen to love his work! That's not 
              the case out there in the poetry society of the U.S.A., any more 
              than it's the case with Koch, O'Hara, Guest, or even Ashbery. I 
              have a neighbor who is a poet, a very nice guy who was originally 
              a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Robert Lowell's and whose national reputation 
              is a good deal bigger than Schuyler's. Fred Seidel. I don't know 
              if you know his name &#150; this is where the poetry committees 
              and &quot;communities&quot; (read: factions) come into play. He 
              and Schuyler were nominated for &#150; was it the National Book 
              Award? &#150; the same year. I remember talking to Fred in the elevator 
              about it. He was hardly aware of Schuyler! One of the things &#150; 
              maybe this is a way of getting to the heart of the matter &#150; 
              I complained about in my response to Helen Vendler's piece (which 
              was positive, by the way) was that I didn't think she gave any sense 
              of why Jimmy is such an extraordinary poet, almost as though the 
              fact that he is had never occurred to her. As though, yes, to go 
              back to your earlier question, she was attending to him not because 
              she really liked or truly admired the poetry, but because he had 
              won a prize, had been nominated for another, and in addition had 
              published a book-length poem. In that sort of climate of readers 
              and critics, it's hard to imagine poets getting their due for the 
              right reasons if at all &#150; except occasionally, when someone 
              like Douglas Crase writes about Jimmy. But of course it's Vendler's 
              opinions that get the attention. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JJ: 
              On another note, you've said you don't think Schuyler will be considered 
              a major poet. I mean, it seems to me that if a poet like Schuyler 
              has any weakness it's a limited range &#150; not a limited emotional 
              range, but of subject matter and style.<br>
              <br>
              CN: Actually, I'm sorry now I ever brought up the major-minor idea! 
              I've written elsewhere that the &quot;minor&quot; poets are the 
              ones who more often inspire me. But yes, I can't imagine him ever 
              being considered major, whatever that means. However, I wouldn't 
              agree that the limited range is a weakness in any sense. Poets &#150; 
              artists of all kinds &#150; write about or paint whatever they're 
              &quot;given&quot; to write about or paint. I'm sure, as I suggested 
              before, Jimmy's focus on landscapes, and especially flowers, must 
              be some sort of displacement: what you don't or won't write about 
              has a way of showing itself to be what you care most about, or in 
              some fundamental sense are. But in the long poems, he did show a 
              lot more of himself than previously, and the range, especially in 
              <i>The Morning of the Poem</i>, is quite large indeed. I guess if 
              I were editing a <i>Selected</i>, I'd omit some of the poems that 
              focus on flowers, say, but I don't think I'm willing to call it 
              a weakness in the area of subject matter &#150; and certainly not 
              style. What counts, always, is how well something is done. Is Creeley's 
              narrow range a limitation? Is Kenneth's reliance on &quot;poetry 
              ideas&quot; &#150; formulas &#150; a limitation? I may prefer certain 
              of Jimmy's poems to others, or feel I've seen enough of what seems 
              to me to be a particular kind of poem of his already, but that's 
              true of all one's favorites. Did Chopin write too many nocturnes? 
              That's a long-winded answer, I'm afraid, and it's my fault for introducing 
              the mostly unimportant and in some ways spurious distinction between 
              major and minor poets! By the way, I've written elsewhere about 
              the experience of reading a Schuyler poem and feeling, at first, 
              this is familiar, nothing out of the ordinary, and then having the 
              poem &quot;strike,&quot; much more sharply and importantly than 
              seemed possible at first glance.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              &quot;Empathy and New Year&quot; comes to mind. He's just observing 
              what's going on, but by the end he has taken the reader into a profound 
              meditation on the nature of time.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Yes. A colloquial meditation.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AM: 
              Do you teach Schuyler at Pace University?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              Not as much as I teach some other contemporary poets. Actually, 
              I find he's very hard to teach, for the same reasons he's hard to 
              write about. Maybe I also care too much about how he goes over. 
              It depends on the class, of course. I have taught him in advanced 
              courses. In my experience he doesn't wow beginning writers as much 
              as the other New York poets &#150; or, for obvious reasons, Ginsberg 
              or Sylvia Plath or, say, Mayakovsky. Again, I probably have too 
              much invested in him. All of us who teach have had the experience 
              of having our favorites fall on deaf ears &#150; but with Jimmy 
              it's more likely to happen than with the others. It has to do with 
              a lot of things, I think, his subject matter, his quietness, his 
              subtlety, his preciousness, his falling through the conceptual cracks. 
              Or maybe when all is said and done he's, dare I say it, a poet's 
              poet. Many of the best poets are!</font></p>

              AM: What are some things people should know about Schuyler? </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CN: 
              The writing first and foremost, poems and prose. Really getting 
              to know it. The only thing I can think of &#150; and remember that 
              I didn't know him that well &#150; is how tough he could be when 
              it came to the things he cared about, especially writing, as I witnessed 
              first-hand in going over potential contributors to <i>Broadway</i>. 
              Some of those I suggested, who I thought were naturals, he was derisive 
              about! He eventually gave in on a few, but not all. Apparently he 
              was a wonderful editor of his friends' poems, and they were lucky 
              to have him. From reading his letters in manuscript, I learned that 
              he helped Kenneth a good deal with at least one of his books on 
              teaching kids to write poetry. Like Fairfield Porter, with whom 
              he was so close for so long, he could be quite blunt. But he could 
              also be charming. I tend to think that the Jimmy I knew was too 
              often not himself, too often a heavy and heavily medicated lookalike, 
              who miraculously managed to retain some of his marvelous abilities. 
              Seeing photographs of him from the '40s and '50s in his published 
              diaries gave me a very different feeling about what he was like 
              at the time when I wish I had known him. I'm sure the literary biography 
              Nathan Kernan has now signed on to write will give a much more balanced 
              picture than many have at present. </font></p>
