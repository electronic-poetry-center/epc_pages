Derived from a page (and preceding line) of Gertrude Stein's "A Long Gay
Book" (A Stein Reader, edited by Ulla E. Dydo, last line of 240 thru
241--determined by a logarithm table) via Charles O. Hartman's program
DIASTEX5, his latest automation of one of my diastic procedures developed
in 1963, using the 1st paragraph of the source as seed, and subsequent
editing: some exisions of words and changes of word order within lines;
changes and additions of capitals, periods, and spaces.<br><br>
