      <p>Ambiguous words  provide harmless<br />
        remarks. Suddenly  things mean something quite<br />
        different. Transfigured  faces. Harmless<br />
        laughter sounds  like derision. A fire<br />
      breaks out  in a faraway town.</p>
      <p><br />
        Brilliant hair. Blowing.  In the morning, I<br />
        run away.  No direction. No<br />
        up or down.  No dimension. Everything<br />
        happens quickly. A  subtle, per-<br />
        vasive,        and strangely  uncertain light.</p>
      <p><br />
        Conversation in a low  voice through an iron<br />
        tube 3,120  feet in length. Eternal harmony,<br />
        practicing on  silent violins. Fourteen times<br />
        lighter than air.  Thus we distinguish<br />
        primary,  nondirectional urge. Driven.</p>
      <p><br />
        First, in default  of anything better, with<br />
        a little  tin cannon, the torn remnants of which are<br />
        now before you.  We can compare it to a<br />
        photographic plate.  Happiness contentless<br />
        but bright. Afterward,  with pistols.</p>
      <p><br />
        It is  a pulse and not a puff. Specifically: in the<br />
        limbs, forehead,  chest, or stomach. She hurts<br />
        in her breast and  her abdomen, but it is<br />
        more a  sadness. A progressive<br />
        series, subject to interruption.</p>
      <p><br />
        Something is going  on. The dead Arch-<br />
        duke        is resurrected. Unusual<br />
        beauty of the  landscape. I think the world<br />
        is turning around me. Whatever  position we<br />
        take, space is not  place.</p>
      <p><br />
        The two men in  raincoats, a few<br />
        steps away, are the  priest Melchizedek and old<br />
        Doc Brinkley. Overpowering  glory of the sun-<br />
        light.        Menacing faces.  Traps. Allusions. At<br />
        twelve o'clock,  there are additional insults.</p>
      <p><br />
        The world is  changing. Odd words<br />
        picked up in passing. Scaffolding  around<br />
        sound houses.  Something is bound to<br />
        happen. A trail is  blazing. Hold<br />
        on: there  is always a farther step.</p>
      <p><br />
        Under the voice. To  and fro. And thus tardily<br />
        deliver up the  motion. We shall fly straight<br />
        into the sun. Beware  of starting small&mdash;everything<br />
        else may follow.  Unbearable, because<br />
        it comes from within  and will out.</p>
      <p><br />
        Who first  constructed a perfect violin? While<br />
        the wave moves  forward through considerable<br />
        distance, each  particular particle makes only<br />
        a small excursion. I  myself have had objective<br />
        experiences, which I would not interpret.</p>
