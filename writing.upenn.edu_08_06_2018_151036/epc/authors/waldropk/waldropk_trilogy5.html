      <p>Beauty foreign, my heart<br />
        empty. Love signaling<br />
      from her face.      </p>
      <p> In a grassy clearing, the woods<br />
        crying <em>Waste. Why<br />
      bother?</em>      </p>
      <p> In the shade of a beech, I<br />
        come to myself,<br />
        empty, turn back. It<br />
      is almost noon.      </p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">. . .      </p>
      <p>And while in this wise I<br />
        meditate, the tables are laid, nigh<br />
        on to noon. She holds my<br />
        head between her hands, as if<br />
      thunderstruck.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.      </p>
      <p>
        As for the front steps, they must always<br />
        be an odd number, so that the right<br />
        foot&mdash;with which one mounts<br />
        the first step&mdash;will be first to<br />
      reach the temple.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>Beauty cries out, crying<br />
        with a foreign accent. Before<br />
        the head, within the body, with-<br />
      out      pitch.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Between fall and rise, without<br />
        pitch. Consider well<br />
        the enormity of<br />
      what we must brook.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Bold knights, who've not their<br />
        hearts in their boots, and a thousand<br />
        foot, in a grassy clearing, foot-<br />
        loose.        <em>Why?</em> Full<br />
        speed, says the king on the third<br />
        day of battle. Unaccented<br />
        syllables, rapid, my<br />
      heart empty.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Building, so far from shore, these<br />
      shadows of the high sea waves.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        The distress which these notes cause, the<br />
        central part swollen and un-<br />
        graceful,
        open to the sky,<br />
        without a roof When tiles are<br />
        broken or thrown down by<br />
        wind, we may yet be<br />
      preserved intact.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        The doors are latticework. Ex-<br />
        traordinary
        cadenzas, ornaments<br />
        serving to connect the notes,<br />
        enliven them, em-<br />
        phasize,
        elucidate. Without them the best<br />
        melody might appear meaningless and<br />
      empty.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        A good retreat. Love<br />
        faces signals, would destroy<br />
        the gardens round the town. Tell<br />
        how great a madness: machines for<br />
        war, armor, salted<br />
        meat, a heap of the whole, the whole<br />
        set on fire, blasted,<br />
        dishonored, written down, greatly<br />
        dissatisfied. Now, faced with<br />
        noon, come awe-inspiring pronouncements in<br />
      love's unmistakable mispronunciation.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Heavenly houses should be<br />
        arranged so that passersby<br />
      can glimpse the gods.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        If solid ground can<br />
        not be found, nothing but loose or<br />
        marshy earth to the bottom, then<br />
        it must be dug up, set with pilings<br />
        of charred alder, olive, oak. A dim<br />
        scale indeed, ascending hole<br />
      by hole, admitted only as passing notes.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        If they touch, they<br />
      begin to rot.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Inky darkness discovered in<br />
        the doorway. In<br />
        such cases, love<br />
        signals: did you<br />
        see her yesterday? did you see<br />
        how pale she looked? does<br />
        she like dogs? have you<br />
        put the kettle on? My<br />
      heart in my boots.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        In unison on the right, on<br />
      the left in counterpoint.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Low, broad, clumsy-roofed: let the<br />
        width of the front be<br />
        divided into eleven<br />
      parts and a half.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Many processions re-<br />
        joice
        the heart, conduct us<br />
      safely to the earth.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        My harangue scarcely<br />
        pitched, I'm<br />
        troubled. No music from these<br />
        times remains. <em>Why<br />
        bother?</em> In spring<br />
        all the trees become<br />
        pregnant, lap up water, return<br />
      to their natural strength.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        One must not build temples<br />
        to the same rules to<br />
        all gods alike. While<br />
        Valentine Snow plays, we<br />
        dispense with space, with absolute<br />
      pitch, with a steady scale.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        On the lowest tier, up the<br />
        curving slope, at the top of the hill,<br />
        right in the center, there is<br />
        a mistaken idea,<br />
        colossal, out of<br />
      place, of remarkable clarity.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Players behave differently. But<br />
        still the temple is<br />
        empty with an emptiness<br />
        like the sun at noon. Exactly the<br />
        pitch of my own voice. Void, I<br />
        marvel in this marvelous<br />
      waste.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
      Rise or fall.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Speed</em>, says the shade. Such<br />
      syllables within the body.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Spring infects us on the extreme<br />
        left, an evolution<br />
      of temperament.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Such delight in foreign<br />
        music&mdash;a taste for<br />
        exotic timbres. Between<br />
        the entire body and its separate<br />
        members, we have nothing but<br />
        respect, so vital<br />
      the delicate vacillations.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        This arrangement involves<br />
        dangers: continuous<br />
        glide, columns cracked by<br />
        reason of the great<br />
        width of the intervals. Too<br />
        sensitive to permit any<br />
        answers, roaming across<br />
        Mitteleuropa, having no<br />
      rules for pain. . . </p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        Toward noon, I turn<br />
        to this tremendous beech and<br />
      move into its shade.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>
        We counteract ocular<br />
        deception by an adjustment<br />
        of proportions, the air seeming to<br />
      eat away and diminish the shaft.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>We have no example of this.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>What's there to<br />
        follow? Will you<br />
        come? At the sound of the<br />
        horn, perfect<br />
      peace restored.      </p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">.</p>
      <p>With due regard to<br />
        diminution, let a line<br />
        be drawn. The higher the eye has<br />
        to climb, observing more anxious<br />
        values of symmetry, the less<br />
        easily can it make its way<br />
        through the thicker and<br />
        thicker mass of air, long<br />
      reiterations of single notes, con-<br />
      structed
      out of old roofing tiles.</p>
      <p class="body_14_padded">. . .      </p>
      <p> Sun nearly to<br />
        noon, I turn<br />
      aside, seek shade.</p>
      <p>Why follow<br />
        nothing? Why<br />
      waste the woods' green cry?      </p>
      <p> Love signals, but my heart<br />
        is empty, beauty<br />
      foreign.</p>
