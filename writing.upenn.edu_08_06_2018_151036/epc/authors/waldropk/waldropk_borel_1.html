        in the sand, but nobody knows what the  ostrich<br />
        sees. I looked for something I had  lost. Indeed I<br />
        spend much of my time looking. Things  don't<br />
        always turn out what they are, I don't  know why.<br />
        A young woman passing by asks me the  time.<br />

      as if the fact that it's eight o'clock  were my fault.</p>

        South but  I know it is. Under the big linden in the front<br />
        yard a couple of  little old men, happy and hard of<br />
      hearing, were  rocking. The tree their too close con-<br />
      nection        &mdash; dead, all their  loves. What better escape<br />
        from boredom than  traveling? It was early in June. The<br />
        morning threatened  to wind up before it began. The old<br />
        men had no idea.  Even the taxi drivers felt guilty.<br />
        Courtiers made  clever remarks. Authentic alphabetical<br />
      melodrama: I  was slogging through a bog of indexes.</p>
