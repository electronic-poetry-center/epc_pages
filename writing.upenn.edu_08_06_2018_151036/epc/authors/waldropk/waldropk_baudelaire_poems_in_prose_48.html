          Lisbon? It must  be warm there and you could bask like a lizard. The<br />
          city is on the  water; they claim it is built out of marble  and that the<br />
          people so  hate vegetation that they've uprooted all trees.  There's a<br />

          like unto Death. &mdash; I'm the one in charge, poor soul. We will<br />
          pack our trunks  for Tomeo. Let's go farther, to the far end of the  
          Baltic; <br />
          still farther  from life, if possible: we 'II go live at the  pole. There<br />
          the sun  skims earth obliquely and  the slow alternations of light and<br />
          night suppress  variety and increase monotony, that half measure of<br />
          nothing. There we could  take long shadow-baths, except when, to<br />
          divert us, the  northern lights send us from time to time their rosy<br />
          showers, like  reflections of Hell's fireworks.&quot;</p>
