      <p class="body_bold">The Unity of Jo&euml;  Bousquet</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">Since I am here in  a personal account and on the borderlines of emotion and of confidences, I  cannot end this book without mentioning the room in Carcassonne where Jo&euml;  Bousquet, bedridden since 1917 as a result of his wound,  received his friends, most of whom were also mine. I recall seeing there Claude  Est&egrave;ve, Pierre Sire, Franz Molino, Ren&eacute; Nelli, Maria Sire, Henri F&eacute;raud, Jean  Ballard who often came from Marseille, Max Ernst who sometimes came from Paris,  Carlo Suar&egrave;s, and many besides. It was there I first  discovered surrealism. The walls of the room were covered with paintings by  Tanguy, Ernst, Masson, Dali, Miro, and the appearance of each number of the <em>Revolution  surr&eacute;aliste </em>came to fulfill an expectation and seemed to bear a message.  Can Bousquet be called a surrealist? He realized, in any case, that sort of  unity of man that in many respects surrealism sought; in him dream and  perception were truly identical. Moreover, from that identity there resulted a  great obscurity in his writings; the language, ceaselessly turning  back upon itself, left the reader before pure opacity. This is what I noted,  for example, with regard to <em>Rendezvous d'un soir d'hiver.</em>&quot;<sup>1 </sup>The  author,&quot; I wrote, &quot;wants to attain by love to a mystical knowledge of  the world. But his book differs from the mystical works to which we are accustomed  in that, first of all, it disconcerts and seems to mask a failure. Could that  come from the fact that the loved woman, being here the end of all seeking and  yet remaining woman and yet loved, hinders  the lover with all her exteriority from attaining the unity toward which he  tends? Nothing of the kind. Annie's reality is that of the world and there  is no dualism. But while the mystics conduct us in general only to the borders  of their experience and claim that it is unspeakable, Bousquet attempts to  communicate his. Now this enterprise is, strictly, unrealizable, since language, by  essence discursive, cannot express the unity of an intuition. So in Bousquet's  book there are contradictions, phrases that fall away, and as if set  toward obscurity. Language in fact must there negate itself at each step, so  that what it has separated can be united. But let one abandon oneself to these  contradictions that deliver us from the various, and he will perceive that the  world of love is at hand: it is the real world, the world of matter&mdash;from which  we are absent&mdash;where things have taken the place of their names.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">I again affirmed  this unity of Bousquet in a note I wrote in 1947 for  the <em>Journal des poètes,</em><sup>2</sup> in which Bousquet told me  he recognized himself completely. I evoke there our first interview:</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">&quot;I  was eighteen when I first met Jo&euml; Bousquet. The day before I was still afraid  of the encounter that I was told was necessary. Uneasy adolescent, dissatisfied  with myself, I was protesting a fate that seemed to me encountered from  without. But I detested in others this way of not being oneself, which nevertheless  made up my life. And what could that man be whom the course of the world had so  strictly cut off from itself? I imagined him still occupied with his foiled  plans, perhaps rebelling, perhaps escaping himself, perhaps finally resigned  and asking from willpower the self-harmony that an accident had broken. Any  solution for him seemed to me noncoincidental or of a constructed coincidence.</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">&quot;I have known  Bousquet for more than twenty years. And it is always of him I think when I  want to persuade myself that nothing is unjust and that the unity of man is possible.  Bousquet is undivided being. It must not be concealed  that, by that fact itself, he irritates. But not by his faults&mdash;it is in  perceiving that the friendship one bears him is itself impure. Because in  dominating we always love, what we cherish in our friends is their vulnerability.  Their faults, I mean to the extent they are open to us, permit us that  community of weakness that is called conscious communication. Here we are  consoling, compassionate, desirous of healing, avid to render the other still  more miserable.</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">&quot;Bousquet  discourages these impure games. This does not make him easy to like. He has no  destiny, for he is his destiny. He has not been injured, for he is his  injury. I do not call him stoic, wanting what he is,  but one, being what he is. Nothing is more laughable than the  opinion that he is 'a modern author.' For no one is less than he of this idiotic  age, where men are constructed by concepts, take for their real drama that of  their thoughts and go from reflection to life. The essential obscurity of Bousquet's  texts is not the fabricated obscurity nowadays fashionable. And nothing is more  vain than wanting to explicate these texts by going behind what is obvious in them  to find the concepts from which they were born. For they are not offspring of  consciousness, but of nature. Bousquet has no system. The system is born from  seeking in objects a unity that the self does not discover in itself. Bousquet is  one; his wound has made him invulnerable, incomprehensible. It has  conferred on him the beauty of those forces which we record without having to  think, for they are of the order of being and not of the order of spirit.</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">&quot;Bousquet does  not construct himself, does not express himself;  he is manifested. Before knowing him I feared that the separation within  oneself that in man we call consciousness would have in him the aspect of a  wound, rather than an opening onto the world. In fact Bousquet is not open to  the world, but it is because he is not separated from himself. His body takes  the place of consciousness. His richness is in it; he is himself  a world, he is absolute creator. He has taught me everything and has taught  me nothing. I owe him no idea; I owe him knowing  what without him I would never have known: his admirable  words, closed, perfect, reveal to me that he is the being for which all  consciousness longs. No doubt he will never know completely what he was for me  and for all those who had the unique chance to see and hear him.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">Bousquet, even so,  had to evolve. Toward the end of his life, Jean Paulhan became almost his  sole master. Paulhan persuaded him that he should substitute in  his preoccupations the problem of language for that of being. But the character  of Bousquet was such that, from this new point of view, he found again, in  another style, his unity. He intended to coincide, this time, with the events of  his life, considered as a sort of language and, if I  may put it so, as the absolute of the problem. And his past work itself would  be illuminated with a new light. I tried, after Jo&euml; Bousquet's death, to  understand him as, in his last days, he wanted to be understood. I reproduce  here, to end this book, the last lines that I wrote on my friend. One will find  in them, I think, the theme of the identity of man and his fate that we have so  often encountered in surrealism. But the negation of transcendence seems to me  more striking yet in Jo&euml; Bousquet than in Breton. Bousquet tries to reduce  himself entirely to events.<sup>3</sup> Breton considers  &quot;that what I take for objective manifestations of my existence ... are  only what happens in the limits of this life of an activity whose true field is  totally unknown to me .... &quot; <sup>4<br />
      </sup> He  seems then to appeal to the transcendence that elsewhere he denies. And I believe  that this implicit appeal to transcendence is what  distinguishes Breton most profoundly from those who left surrealism, whether,  like Aragon or Eluard, for political action or, like Leiris, Queneau, and  Bousquet, for the concern with pure language. Whether he evokes against the  latter the unknown that our life merely expresses or, meeting the former,  judges history according to the vertical dimension of ethics and refuses to  justify the means by the end, Breton always recovers the truth of metaphysics.  And this is why, engaged in paths that are not his, I have been able in this  book to recognize in Andre Breton one of my thinking-masters.</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified"><span class="body_bold">Jo&euml; Bousquet and  the Ethic of Language</span> <sup>5</sup></p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">No idea has cast  more of a shadow over the creations of the spirit than that of vocation. It masks  the relation between men and their lives; it leads to the supposition that the  poet or the philosopher has a sort of message anterior to his  existence, expressing itself without regard to daily  difficulties and as if in spite of them. To speak of vocation is always to take  the side of revolt, to prefer a man to his life, to believe there was more  richness in his dream than in his history. It is  always closing ones eyes.</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">Jo&euml; Bousquet's eyes  were open. &quot;The only morality I retain,&quot; he writes, &quot;is that  which ... imposes on us, as sole principle of entire existence, the fact that  comes to us, whatever it is, holds that event alone is real, it being our part  to accomplish its perfection and splendor.&quot;<sup>5</sup> Those  who knew Bousquet know how scrupulously he followed this rule, his only rule. If his  life was beautiful and to this extent seductive, it was because, far from wanting  to make it his work, he found his basis in it.</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified"> Without the accident of his  wound, Bousquet would doubtless never have written. We cannot therefore speak of  an innate mission, a first intuition of the World and of man. But,  wounded, Bousquet considered his wound as a sort of birth, annulling  his birth in the flesh. &quot;I escaped,&quot; he says, &quot;from the mortal  consequences of a shock, to render doubtful the dispositions my birth had given me. By  untiring labor I substituted for me a cultured being.&quot; <sup>6</sup> So,  mortally wounded, he seemed to us no longer mortal. He had ceased to be a child  of Nature to become one of events. Of all future events, he seemed to us  then to have to remain the consciousness and the echo. </p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">And such was the sense of his work. With  anyone else literary concerns would have been evasion, compensation. One can  forget a misfortune in the exercise of an art with borrowed forms and in the  pleasures of vanity the exercise provides. Bousquet's genius was, on the contrary,  to understand that by the effects of his wound separation had become his  essence. His wound had made him a poet; he was to consecrate his poetry, not to  forgetting it but to deepening it. &quot;I put  all my strength into naturalizing the accident that victimized my youth. I wanted  it to cease to be outside me.&quot; <sup>7</sup></p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified"> Bousquet  followed out the rigor of such a project, which led him to an ethic of  language. In expressing it he placed the value with the expressed, leaving the  inwardness to dissolve in the visible and the experienced sadness in the light  of the object. &quot;I know,&quot; he says, &quot;that death and unhappiness  are images.&quot; <sup>8</sup> The poems of Bousquet, Rene Nelli writes, &quot;express all the  reduction of oneself to the event.&quot; <sup>9</sup> Here  is the key to these obscure texts that always seem to close upon themselves. To  learn to read them, we must understand to what point the reduction Nelli speaks  of was imposed by the necessity of a fate that Bousquet wanted to accept, to  the extent of becoming it.</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">Each man must  choose between the search for a paradise lost, which seems to him like his  being, and the difficult effort by which he identifies with the object, with  history, that is to say, with the truth of a discourse. Bousquet thus opposes  knowledge and existence: &quot;The apotheosis of knowledge excludes  existence.&quot; <sup>10</sup> And if he complains of writing with difficulty, it is not in  order to deplore some crudeness, but to signify that the act of writing engages  his life, separating it from its being. &quot;What dominates this close of the  year,&quot; we read in his diary, &quot;is the crushing conviction that I  understand nothing of my art. I do not know how to write.&quot; <sup>11</sup> This  apparently banal uneasiness soon reveals its depths: &quot;I  am not the author of what I have done passably well. One could  say that the effort expended in expressing myself aggravates the misunderstanding  between my thought and me.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">And Bousquet  certainly expresses here a difficulty common to all writers.  But instead of deploring the insufficiency of words and taking refuge by a  facile movement in some ineffable experience, he prefers language to himself  and, with language, the objective tissue of his life: &quot;It  displeases me to feel more real than the thought to which I long  to submit.&quot; <sup>12</sup> He knows that thought, being discourse, is closer to event than  to being; events may be spoken, their nature is that of words. Here Bousquet  accepts, consents, &quot;I sought for all the facts that made me fall under the  domination of my words.&quot; <sup>13</sup></p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified"> This ethic of language  explains, I think, how at the end of his life Bousquet occupied himself almost  exclusively with the work of Jean Paulhan. I believe also that his reserves  with regard to Cartesian thought had their deeper source there. He did not fall  into the error of those who see in that thought only the transparency of clear  ideas; rather, he was disquieted to see Descartes accord being to thought. Of the  &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; he once wrote me, &quot;What  will you answer if I tell you that off and on  I sense, to the point of madness, that I am being thought?&quot; &quot;I feel  the idea of self nourish itself on the things that happen to me .... &quot; And  elsewhere: &quot;I do not think of describing objects. I put myself in front of  them, until I am not regarding them, but they see me and invent in my eyes  their own image which would put me to sleep at their feet.&quot;</p>
      <p class="body_16_22_justified">So in this age in which  existentialists and linguistic philosophers violently disagree, Bousquet was  able to find in the objective event and in the language that describes it the  reason for his very existence. His asceticism was not that of a hermit who had  voluntarily forsaken the world, but of a lover whom the world ha&middot;d forsaken &nbsp;and who could find  the world again only by preferring it to himself, searching only in the  splendor of things for the essence of his sorrows. Nothing is farther from this  authentic quest of being by the word than the artificial creation of works from  concepts so common in our day. This is where Bousquet was like no one else. He  was not of those who go from reflection to life and take for their drama that  of their thoughts. He had rather find, with the aid of images and words, his  lost life and avoid sterile revolt by preferring what he saw and what he said  to what he was. So he was always consoling, not by the illusion of some  promise, but by the truth of reconciliation. In the cemetery of Villalier, where  we accompanied him on a morning of rain and sunshine, he seemed to welcome us,  to have taken the form and the colors of a landscape he had loved more than he loved  himself. And I would be faithful to him in no longer seeking the truth of his voice but in those I still  hear, or the exactitude of his thoughts but in the World's visage.</p>
