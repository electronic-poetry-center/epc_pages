        <b>Richard Foreman's Foray Into Politics </b></font><br>
        <br>
        By BEN BRANTLEY <br>
        <br>
        Something hard and noisy is hammering at the door of Richard Foreman's 
        dream world. And Mr. Foreman, the avant-garde magician famous for keeping 
        his plays hermetically sealed, has been obliged to let the intruder in. 
        Yes, political reality has stuck its sharp, bony head into the metaphysical 
        puzzles and swirling illusions of Foreman Land in the shape of a would-be 
        cowboy king with dreams of a globe-spanning empire. </p>
      <p>This high-aspiring, dimwitted and exceedingly dangerous fellow -- whose 
        role model just happens to be the sitting American president -- is the 
        title character in ''King Cowboy Rufus Rules the Universe,'' which opened 
        last night at St. Mark's Church in the East Village, where Mr. Foreman 
        annually stages peerless miniextravaganzas for his Ontological-Hysteric 
        Theater. As is customary for this director, ''King Cowboy'' is a dazzling 
        mind tease, replete with images that somehow seem to have originated in 
        your own head. </p>
      <p><br>
        Yet while the production offers the dizzy theatrical joys expected of 
        Mr. Foreman, the light of his polemical anger shows chinks in his mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. 
        Visually, ''King Cowboy'' is as rich as any Foreman production in recent 
        years, transforming the tiny St. Mark's stage into a labyrinthine and 
        lavish cultural scrapheap. But it seldom hijacks your senses the way Mr. 
        Foreman's work usually does. </p>
      <p>Rufus, played in grandly effete style by Jay Smith, is definitely not 
        your standard-issue Wild West hero. He dresses like a Restoration fop, 
        handkerchief fluttering from sleeve, and speaks in a tonier-than-thou 
        English drawl. But oh, how he would love to fill a 10-gallon hat and wield 
        a six-shooter to bring the world to its knees. </p>
      <p>Amid exchanges of dislocated dialogue with his adversarial companions 
        -- a Humphrey Bogart-like nobleman (T. Ryder Smith) and a coquette with 
        the voice of a Bouvier sister (Juliana Francis) -- Rufus lusts after crowns 
        and globes that intermittently dangle from above. Of course, he always 
        wants the largest of these. And the mere prospect of violence both races 
        and quells his dandy's heart. </p>
      <p>Most of the stylistic Foreman signatures are in place here: the cross-cultural 
        medley of musical fragments; the strings and poles that segment the stage; 
        vulnerable baby dolls and menacing thugs in animal outfits (this time, 
        bears instead of gorillas); the chorus of sinister functionaries in internationally 
        eclectic attire. (As Diana Vreeland might have said, why not top your 
        kilt with a tailored evening jacket and black cowboy hat?) </p>
      <p>Nowhere to be seen, though, is the pane of plastic that has traditionally 
        separated Mr. Foreman's audiences from the stage. Its absence allows Rufus 
        to walk up the aisle to survey his domain, ''primed and ready to fulfill 
        my every desire,'' as he puts it. The implicit message is that it is now 
        impossible -- or at least irresponsible -- to isolate art from life. The 
        same idea comes across in words chanted again and again by Ms. Francis 
        and by Mr. Foreman, in electronic voiceover: ''Wake up.'' </p>
      <p>The script for ''King Cowboy'' is more verbose and less cryptic than 
        usual for Mr. Foreman, although those unfamiliar with his work will no 
        doubt still be at sea. And since a program note makes it clear that the 
        play is a response to the politics of George W. Bush, you find yourself 
        listening for direct topical references. </p>
      <p>They're definitely there but rendered in poetic Foremanspeak. ''Rhyme 
        things that don't rhyme,'' Rufus says. ''You understand -- words don't 
        come easily to someone trying to be an all-powerful American cowboy.'' 
        Ms. Francis exclaims, ''Oh, frigid man -- I recognize the sneer inside 
        the cowboy voice.'' And there are many passages in which Rufus is more 
        and more megalomaniacal. </p>
      <p>Some of this is pretty funny. But Mr. Foreman's strength as a writer 
        has always been his refusal to spell anything out. His scripts are most 
        often made up of tantalizing, repeated non sequiturs that assume different 
        meanings as you listen. ''King Cowboy'' is weighed down by literal-minded 
        allegory, and you rarely surrender yourself to the phantasmagoria, as 
        you long to. </p>
      <p>That said, the staging itself is beyond fault, as are the highly disciplined, 
        spookily silly performers. (I also enjoyed the Lewis Carroll-style songs.) 
        No one is better than Mr. Foreman at creating the sense of a confounding 
        universe out of joint and on a slick road to nowhere. That's the sense 
        of the world a lot of people have these days. Paradoxically, Mr. Foreman's 
        vision would feel far more relevant without the political footnotes. </p>
