        <br>
        Before the vital and brilliant American playwright and director Richard 
        Foreman found a permanent home for his Ontological-Hysteric Theater, at 
        St. Mark's Church, in 1992, you had to seek out his annual productions 
        in small, experimental venues around town. I first went to one of Foreman's 
        plays, &quot;Eddie Goes to Poetry City: Part 2,&quot; at La Mama in 1991. 
        I had never seen anything like it before, and haven't seen anything comparable 
        since. By then, I'd already heard about Foreman; I knew that he not only 
        had been writing, directing, and designing his own plays since 1968 but 
        also had directed works by Brecht and Moli&egrave;re, here and abroad, 
        and staged a number of operas, ranging from Johann Strauss to Philip Glass. 
        Still, nothing had prepared me for the darkness and the dazzle-the murky 
        splendor-of &quot;Eddie.&quot; A kind of Cubist &quot;Candide&quot; that 
        evoked the wretchedness of desire, the play infiltrated my thoughts until 
        its actors and its dialogue began to feel like figments of my own imagination, 
        suddenly made real in my poetry city, New York. </p>
      <p>Eddie, a sweet, open-faced na&iuml;f, was a poet-Christ figure, wandering 
        through a corrupt metropolis where a series of hardboiled female characters 
        tried to lure him down the slippery, sexy path to wisdom. And yet he remained 
        largely incorruptible. The cynicism he encountered was as baffling to 
        him as the lipsticked sirens whose movements were choreographed to entice 
        him. At some point, his good-natured optimism began to feel almost as 
        grotesque and willful as the temptations of the villains around him. To 
        tell Eddie's story, Foreman eschewed the conventional dramatic devices 
        of exposition, motivation, and resolution in linear time and space. Throwing 
        Aristotle out, he ushered the subconscious in. His dialogue was full of 
        the hilarious slips of the tongue and double entendres of daily life that 
        allow our sentiments, as well as our nightmares, to seep to the surface. 
        In an essay in his 1992 collection, &quot;Unbalancing Acts: Foundations 
        for a Theater,&quot; Foreman explained his artistic intent this way: &quot;Society 
        teaches us to represent our lives to ourselves within the framework of 
        a current narrative, but beneath that conditioning we feel our lives as 
        a series of multidirectional impulses and collisions.&quot; He went on, 
        &quot;I like to think of my plays as an hour and a half in which you see 
        the world through a special pair of eyeglasses. These glasses may not 
        block out all narrative coherence, but they magnify so many other aspects 
        of experience that you simply lose interest in trying to hold on to narrative 
        coherence, and instead, allow yourself to become absorbed in the moment-by-moment 
        representation of psychic freedom.&quot;</p>
      <p>In short, Foreman is a poetic realist. The psychic freedom in his work 
        grows, oddly, out of his fixed obsessions-namely, female sexuality (he 
        generally views women as dangerous, conniving, alluring vamps) and his 
        own Jewishness. Foreman has described himself as a &quot;closet religious 
        writer,&quot; and many of the stage sets he designs contain symbols from 
        Jewish mysticism, which serve as talismans of his faith and of what that 
        faith has generated in him: a spirit of inquiry, skepticism, and hope. 
        Foreman's casts always include at least one character-usually male-who 
        appears as the Semitic model of disbelief. </p>
      <p>In his latest work, &quot;King Cowboy Rufus Rules the Universe!,&quot; 
        that character is given the rather stolid yet florid name of Baron Herman 
        De Voto (played by the versatile T. Ryder Smith). At the beginning of 
        the play, De Voto, dressed like an errant rabbi in a dark suit and a stiff 
        black wig, renounces his ownership of a tobacco factory, which, it seems, 
        is the source of all social evil. Sitting at a table, facing the audience, 
        De Voto intones in the snidest of voices, &quot;Thank God I am closing 
        down my dilapidated tobacco factory-stuffed full of coquettes and whores. 
        I've had enough of this shit world in which I find myself.&quot; This 
        is Krazy Kat by way of Spengler-a distinctly Yiddish locution with a nasty 
        street snarl, which tips De Voto into a defensive kind of despair. De 
        Voto serves as a sort of alter ego for Foreman-the critic in the playwright's 
        mind, the character who doubts the artistic process even as he becomes 
        an integral part of it. With his deadpan face and conservative gestures, 
        De Voto is the heckler at the back of the class. In this case, the classroom 
        is the world. And the world is an outgrowth of Foreman's distinctive visual 
        imagination. </p>
      <p>The stage at St. Mark's is relatively small-it measures twenty-eight 
        feet across-but Foreman floods it with information. Stage left: oil paintings 
        in fake-gilt frames show women in Renaissance dress, standing by canals. 
        Stage right: a sign advertises the Maison Rouge, a cathouse. At the front 
        of the stage, facing the audience, Foreman has placed four poles, each 
        holding a cluster of light bulbs that give off a migraine-inducing glare. 
        Above the center of the stage, a row of fluorescent lights flicker. As 
        the director Peter Sellars points out in the foreword to &quot;Unbalancing 
        Acts,&quot; in a Richard Foreman production, &quot;There are messages 
        written all over the set. . . . The lights are flashing because, in our 
        lives, the lights are flashing. Are we getting the signals . . . or are 
        we going to shut our eyes until it's all over? Are we able to gaze steadily 
        into the source of brightest light? At what point does it become too painful?&quot;</p>
      <p>Part of what makes Foreman's characters feel like apparitions-figures 
        who, in the midst of a hideous, cluttered landscape, seem to take in nothing 
        at all-is their lack of response to the glare. Light is as natural to 
        them as darkness is to a bat. At least, Susie Sitwell (Juliana Francis), 
        a former worker at De Voto's factory, seems to flower in it. Delivering 
        her lines with the flat affect of a lobotomized but naughty ing&eacute;nue, 
        doused in L'Air du Temps and intelligence-her sharp, stilted movements 
        recall those of Oliver Sacks's &quot;sleeping&quot; patients in the film 
        &quot;Awakenings&quot;-Susie is looking for a new boss, a new man, a new 
        hero, to take De Voto's place. (Without a man, she makes clear, her existence 
        as a self-described &quot;coquette&quot; would be meaningless.) The man 
        she needs appears almost at once: King Cowboy Rufus (the gifted Jay Smith), 
        who decides to buy the tobacco factory. Wearing a ten-gallon hat and an 
        eighteenth-century frock coat, his lips and face rouged and powdered beyond 
        anything Beau Brummell could have imagined, his belly jiggling over his 
        sheepskin chaps, Rufus stalks the small stage with aplomb. This is his 
        world, he seems to be saying; we're just living in it. &quot;Are you really 
        an American cowboy hero?&quot; Susie asks him. &quot;Or rather-an old-fashioned 
        English fop harboring impossible dreams of glory?&quot; Well, Rufus is 
        a bit of both. And why not? Isn't this make-believe?</p>
      <p>It is, and it isn't. Rufus's will to power-like that of the world leaders 
        he evokes, George W. Bush and Tony Blair-is as real as he is invented. 
        Rufus is a symbol of imperialism gone mad. &quot;I'm no traitor. And I'll 
        prove it easily with my subsequent violent behavior,&quot; he announces. 
        He has &quot;family values&quot;-dolls descend from the ceiling whenever 
        he needs to prove that he loves children-but what do those values mean 
        when the very heart of his quest is to suppress and destroy anything that 
        contradicts his own reality? &quot;Recently I find myself performing random 
        acts that just bounce back and forth inside my head like a ferocious game 
        of Cowboy Ping-Pong,&quot; he says, after firing his gun at Susie and 
        trying to strangle De Voto. In the unexplained mayhem that follows, the 
        characters are blindfolded and left to stumble around the stage and slit 
        their throats, in a kind of hell of their own making. </p>
      <p>&quot;King Cowboy Rufus Rules the Universe!&quot; is, ultimately, about 
        our inability to &quot;wake up&quot;-as an offstage voice (Foreman's own) 
        repeatedly commands us to do. The play is one of the most overtly political 
        of Foreman's recent works, but he balances its didacticism with a mordant 
        wit. At the end of the show, the supporting cast carry globes onstage 
        for Rufus's target practice, but he is stymied: he can't choose which 
        world, which reality, to destroy first. &quot;King Cowboy Rufus&quot; 
        echoes the past (from time to time we hear a voice counting in German, 
        punctuating the dialogue). But history, Foreman implies, is what we're 
        done with; now we must make our way, through the blinding lights of CNN 
        and other forms of propaganda, into an unbrave new world. <br>
