 <P>In his introduction to my Selected Poems 1960-1985, Eliot Weinberger
 writes: "As for translation:  the dissolution of the translator's ego is
 essential if the foreign poem is to enter the language-a bad translation
 is the insistent voice of the translator."
 
<p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">My first experience with what I think Weinberger means by "the
 translator's ego" was with Ben Belitt's translations of Garcia Lorca's
 Poet in New York, in 1959.  Belitt appeared to be imposing his own
 poetic voice onto the Spanish text when, for example, he translated the
 last line of Lorca's poem "La Aurora," "como recién salidas de un
 naufragio de sangre" as, "as though lately escaped from a bloody
 disaster."  Lorca's "shipwreck of blood," a powerful direct image that
 needs no translational revision, had not only been lost but turned into
 English-English slang-Belitt's "bloody," as in "he's a bloody good
 bloke," neatly effaced Lorca's "blood."  In the case of Belitt's Lorca
 and Neruda translations, we hear the translator-poet's own mannerisms
 leaking into and rendering rococo the meaning of the original texts.  It
 is as if Belitt is colonizing the foreign terrain of these poets instead
 of accommodating himself to the ways in which they differ from his own
 poetic intentions.

<p> <img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">The image of a translator colonizing the foreign terrain of an
original
 text has somber implications, especially in the case of a "first-world"
 translator working on a "third-world" writer.  By adding to, subtracting
 from and reinterpreting the original, the translator implies that he
 knows better than the original text knows, that in effect his mind is
 superior to its mind.  The "native text" becomes raw material for the
 colonizer-translator to educate and re-form in a way that instructs the
 reader to believe that the foreign poet is aping our literary
 conventions.
        
<p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">Belitt, of course, is not alone in such activity, although his
 imposition seems more monolithic and damaging than that of many other
 translators.  When Robert Lowell drops out ten of Rimbaud's twenty-five
 stanzas in translating  "Le bateau ivre," there seems to be a
 presumption that only two-thirds of one of the greatest poems in the
 French language is worth carrying over to English.  Cid Corman, at times
 an extraordinarily fine translator, has a tendency to eliminate
 repetitive phrases and to drop articles.  This appears to be a
 manifestation of his own poetics which have rendered the line, "pero me
 busca.  Es una historia!" as, "but she looks and looks for me.  What a
 fucking story!"
 
<p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">The Vallejo poem in question her is made up of a series of anguished
 lamentations on the failure of his wife to connect with him.  During the
 first eight years that I translated Vallejo, I was unable to connect
 with Georgette Vallejo-by which I mean that she constantly blocked my
 work with the excuse that no one could properly translate her late
 husband's poetry.  After much effort, by a fluke, Grove Press gained
 permission to publish the translation.  One afternoon I was sitting in
 Gil Sorrentino's office going over galleys.  When I came to the poem in
 question, I read it to Gil and complained that the last line-at that
 point rendered, "but she looks and looks for me.  What a story!"-lacked
 punch.  By that point, Vallejo's "Es una Historia!" was not only loaded
 with his consternation, but had taken on the symbolic weight of my
 struggle with the translation and with his widow.  My memory is that
 after a moment's reflection, Sorrentino threw up his hands and
 exclaimed, "what a fucking story!" and in a giddy moment I said, "that's
 it!" and added the intensifier to the line.  I was wrong to do so, and
 when José Rubia Barcia and I retranslated the poem six years later, we
 took it out.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">I've gone into a little detail here not to excuse myself but to
suggest
 that a translator's impositions upon his text are not necessarily a
 worked-out plan to create a new tone or meaning for the original.  Were
 Lowell to be here, he might explain (probably not to our satisfaction)
 that he left all those stanzas out because he was unable to render them
 to his satisfaction.  Corman might argue that by cutting here and there
 rather than adhering to every point, he had made a sharper and not
 really unfaithful version in English.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">So, how might a translator work to resist ego imposition or, at worst,
 translational imperialism?  For the fact is, there is no such thing as a
 literal translation of a poem-denotative choices come up in every line. 
 There is a constant process of interpretation going on, regardless of
 how faithful one attempts to be to the original.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">When the original poet is available for questioning, a certain amount
 of denotational guesswork can be eliminated.  When one is translating
 the great dead, or out of contact with the author, the only indicators
 come from the text at large, and the way key words can be identified
 relative to the author's background.  While translating the Martinican
 Aimé Césaire with Annette Smith, I visited Césaire several times, always
 with a few pages of specific word questions.  Given Césaire's busy
 schedule, it was never possible to ask him all the questions that came
 up in translating him, so many tricky decisions had to be made on the
 basis of the text itself.  As an example:  Smith and I occasionally came
 across the word "anse," which can be rendered as "bay/cove/creek," of
 "[basket] handle."  Since Césaire's poetry is very specific to
 Martinican geography, and since the entire island is pocked with bays
 and coves (which had led to such place names as Anse Pilote, or Grande
 Anse d'Arlet etc), the obvious choice here seemed to be "bay" or "cove"
 (assuming that the context of a particular poem does not call for a
 "handle" reading).  Yet in the 1969 Berger-Bostock translation of
 Césaire's Notebook of a Return to the Native Land, we find "les Antilles
 qui ont faim...bourgeonnant d'anses frêles..." translated as "the hungry
 Antilles...delicately sprouting handles for the market."  Not only has
 the Surrealist Césaire been falsely surrealized, but the translators
 have backed u their error by adding an explanation to the reader as to
 what these handles are for.  When Smith and I retranslated the Notebook
 in 1976, we rendered these phrases as "the hungry Antilles...burgeoning
 with frail coves..."
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">In the case of Vallejo, I learned not only to check my work with
 Peruvians and Spanish scholars, but to check their suggestions against
 each other and against the dictionary.  I worked to find word-for word
 equivalents, not explanatory phrases.  I also respected Vallejo's
 punctuation, intentional misspellings, line and stanza breaks, and tried
 to render his obscurity and flatness as well as his clarity and
 brilliance.  An unsympathetic reviewer of Barcia's and my work, John
 Simon, exclaimed: "Eshleman has tried to render every wart of the
 original!"  Which is, in fact, exactly what we had tried to do-to create
 in English a non cosmeticized Vallejo.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">As a poet translating another poet, I let my sense of my relationship
 to Vallejo and his poetry enter my own poetry, so that the translating
 activity, in the context of an apprenticeship, was envisioned and
 critiqued as an aspect of my own evolving poetics.  Over the years, I
 constantly tried to skim my own imaginings of Vallejo off the surface of
 the translations and let them ferment in my own poetry.  I came to
 understand that if a translator does not do this, he runs the risk of
 building up an imaginal residue in his translation, which with no
 outlet  of its own, spills into the text.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">The thing is:  Imagination is always present.  We know this when we
try
 to remember and write down a dream upon waking.  As we try to remember,
 we forget, and in the flux we reorganize, imagining the dream into a
 writing that ends up locking the nebulosity of psyche into a fixed grid
 of print.  In a similar way, our imaginations are active as we move one
 language into another.  As we read translationally, we risk revising the
 original to reinforce our dream of a poetics that might hold its own
 against alternative poetics.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">All the poets I have spent long periods of translation time
 with-Neruda, Vallejo, Artaud, Césaire, Deguy-have drawn me because I
 felt that their poetry knew something that my poetry wanted to know. 
 Besides attempting to make accurate, readable versions, I was also
 involved in a secondary plot, or a sub-text, wanting to shovel some of
 their psychic coal into my own furnaces.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">Since translation is such slow work, requiring multiple rereadings, it
 can require a more prolonged reading-in-depth than when we read poetry
 written in our own language.  As the translator scuttles back and forth
 between the original and the rendering he is shaping, a kind of
 "assimilative space" is opened up in which "influence" may be less
 contrived and literary than when drawing upon masters of one's own
 language.  The kind of "influence" I have in mind here involves becoming
 porous to the character of the original, and to the various ways in
 which it resists or does not resist being transformed.
        <p><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">Thus in the case of Vallejo, I do not think of myself as having been
 influenced, at least not directly, by his Marxism, his Christianity, or
 by his own indigenous influence which, since he was a Peruvian sierra
 cholo, gives his writing much of its austerity, anxiety and
 immutability.  No, in Vallejo's case, I believe that it is his capacity
 for contradiction, and the consequent complexity of viewpoint that has
 been the fuel.  He offered me not merely ideas and stances, but a way of
 receiving and twisting the blow of the world.
