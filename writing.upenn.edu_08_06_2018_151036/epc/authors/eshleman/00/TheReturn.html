 <br>
 The anchored spirit,<br>
 screwed into me<br>
 by the psycho-<br>
 lubricious thrust<br>
 of the sky<br>
 is the one who thinks<br>
 every temptation,<br>
 every desire,<br>
 every inhibition.<br><br>

 It's the penetral spider veil,<br>
 the female onor fur<br>
 of either or the sail,<br>
 the anal plate of anayor.<br><br>
 
 (You lift nothing from it, god,<br>
 because it's me.<br>
 You never lifted anything of this order from me.<br>
 I'm writing it here for the first time,<br>
 I'm finding it for the first time.)<br><br>
 
 Not the membrane of the chasm,<br>
 nor the member omitted from this jism,<br>
 issued from a depredation,<br><br>
 
 but an old bag,<br>
 outside membrane,<br>
 outside of there where it's hard or soft.<br><br>
 
 B'now passed through the hard and soft,<br>
 spread out this old bag in palm,<br>
 pulled, stretched like a palm<br>
     <img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif"><img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">of hand<br>
 bloodless from keeping rigid,<br>
 black, violet<br>
 from stretching to soft.<br><br>
 
 But what then in the end, you, the madman?<br><br>

 
 Me?<br><br>
 
 This tongue between four gums,<br><br>
 
 this meat between two knees,<br><br>
 
 this piece of hole<br> 
 for madmen.<br><br> 
 
Yet precisely not for madmen.<br>
 For respectable men,<br>
 whom a delirium to belch everywhere planes,<br><br>
 
 and who from this belch<br>
 made the leaf,<br><br>
 
 listen closely:<br>
 made the leaf<br>
 of the beginning of generations<br>
 in the palmate old bag of my holes,<br>
 mine.<br><br>
 
 Which holes, holes of what?<br><br>
 
 Of soul, of spirit, of me and of being;<br>
  but in the place where no one gives a shit,<br>
 father, mother, Atraud, artoo.<br><br>
 
 In the humus of the plot with wheels,<br>
 in the breathing humus of the plot<br> 
 of this void,<br>
 between hard and soft.<br><br>
 
 Black, violet,<br>
 rigid,<br>
 recreant<br>
 and that's all<br><br>
 
 Which means that there is a bone,<br>
 where<br>

 sat down on the poet,<br>
 in order to sack the ingestion<br>
 of his lines,<br>
 like the head farts<br>
 that he wheedles out of him through his cunt,<br><br>
 
 that he would wheedle out of him from the bottom of the ages,<br>
 down to the bottom of his cunt hole,<br><br>
 
 and it's not a cunt prank<br>
 that he plays on him in this way,<br>
 it's the prank of the whole earth<br>
 against whoever has balls<br> 
 in his cunt.<br><br>
 
 And if you don't get the image<br>
 -and that's what I hear you saying<br>
 in a circle,<br>
 that you don't get the image<br>
 which is at the bottom<br>
 of my cunt hole,-<br><br>
 
 it's because you don't know the bottom,<br>
 not of things,<br>
 but of my cunt,<br>
 mine,<br>
 although since the bottom of the ages <br>
 you've all been lapping there in a circle<br>
 as if badmouthing an alienage,<br>
 plotting an incarnation to death.<br><br>

Between the ass and the shirt,<br>
 between the gism and the under-bet,<br>
 between the member and the let down,<br>

 of the high-pressure trap<br>

 burst dead at the foot of a bound<br><br> 
 
 nor the severed member of a soul<br>
 (the soul is no more than an old saw)<br>
 but the terrifying suspension<br>
 of a breath of alienation<br><br>
 
 raped, clipped, completely sucked off<br>
 by all the insolent riff-raff<br>
 of all the turd-buggered<br>
