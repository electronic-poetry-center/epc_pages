        <img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank.gif">I who Krakatoa<br>
 I who everthing better than a monsoon<br>
 I who open shest<br>
 I who Laelaps<br>
 I who bleat better than a cloaca<br>
 I who outside the musical scale<br>
 I who Zambezi or frantic or rhombos or cannibal<br>
 I would like to be more and more humble and more lowly<br>
 always more serious without vertigo or vestige<br>
 to the point of losing myself falling<br>
 into the live semolina of a well-opened earth<br>
 Outside in lieu of atmosphere there'd be a beautiful haze no dirt in it<br>
 each drop of water forming a sun there<br>
 whose name the same for all things<br>
 would be DELICIOUS TOTAL ENCOUNTER<br>
 so that one would no longer know what goes by<br>
 -a star or a hope<br>
 or a petal from the flamboyant tree<br>
 or an underwater retreat<br>
 raced across by the flaming torches of aurelian jellyfish<br>
 Then I imagine life would flood my whole being<br>
 better still I would feel it touching me or biting me<br>
 lying down I would see the finally free odors come to me<br>
 like merciful hands<br> 
 finding their way<br>
 to sway their long hair in me<br>
 longer than this past that I cannot reach.<br>
 Things stand back make room among you<br> 
 room for my repose carrying in waves<br>
 my frightening crest of anchor-like roots<br>
 looking for a place to take hold<br>
 Things I probe I probe<br>
 me the street-porter I am root-porter<br>
 and I bear down and I force and I arcane<br>
        <img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank.gif">I omphale<br>
 Ah who leads me back toward the harpoons<br>
        <img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank.gif">I am very weak<br>
 I hiss yes I hiss very ancient things<br>
 I whoa lie down wind<br>
 and against my unstable and fresh muzzle<br>
 against my eroded face<br>
 press you cold face of ravaged laughter<br>
 The wind alas I will continue to hear it<br>
 nigger nigger nigger from the depths<br>
 of the timeless sky<br>
 a little less loud than today<br>
 but still too loud<br>
 and this crazed howling of dogs and horses<br>
 which it thrusts at our forever fugitive heels<br>
 but I in turn in the air<br>
 shall rise a scream so violent<br>
 that I shall splatter the whole sky<br>
 and with my branches torn to shreds<br>
 and with the insolent jet of my wounded and solemn bole<br><br>
