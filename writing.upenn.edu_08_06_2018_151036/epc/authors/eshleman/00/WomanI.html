 <font size="5">de Kooning's Woman I</font> <br><br>
 from <u>From Scratch</u>, Black Sparrow Press, 1998.<br><br><br>
 
 is the first in a series, probably not<br>
 in de Kooning's sense of it primal woman or<br>
 first-earliest-woman, but these facets may have been<br>
 on his mind, for we have here a series or "ones,"<br>
 a sacrificed and dismembered "goddess,"<br>
 a kind of North American Coyolxauhqui<br>
 whose circular Stone was discovered at the foot of the Great<br>
        <img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">Temple stairway,<br>
 as well as Madonna and Child,<br>
 the Child at once just born and maybe four,<br>
 he is bald and white, is the Madonna's left shoulder and arm,<br>
 staring at Her, perched on what appears to be<br>
 Her ruddy left thigh, which<br>
 on closer inspection might also be<br>
 the rump of a flat-snouted or headless animal<br>
 lunging to the right, whose back and legs are Her lap and legs,<br>
 lunging into the shredding legs of the figure who uses<br>
 the Madonna's right shoulder and arm as his breast and stomach<br>
 (which is also a red-gartered, chubby, severed thigh)-<br>
 he has long, loosely-tied hair, or is "he" a widwife<br>
 with face hair-a pirate?  sniffing<br>
 or whispering to the Madonna's right temple?<br>
 His breast-stomach is also his right arm<br>
 swinging under the Madonna's haltered and huge right breast,<br>
 and out of his splitting hand<br>
 another hand emerges from which<br>
 shears protrude cutting the Child's umbilicus?<br>
 Or is a castration under way?<br><br>
 
 All this action is simultaneously<br>
 splintered and frozen,<br>
 once we see the Child, the animal, and pirate-midwife,<br>
 there's not much left of Woman I, or<br> 
 let's say she's in sacrificial drag,<br>
 all but her head and breasts are others<br>
 masquerading as her body parts,<br>
 she is a crowned tripod of wedge-head and dome-shielded breasts,<br>
 dismembered and whole?  or have her body parts been stuffed into<br> 
        <img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">new roles?<br>
 Over-sized Mesopotamian eyes, hypnotic,<br>
 teeth like a porticullis<img src="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/eshleman/00/blank5.gif">beaver-set into her face,<br>
 the gaze of one who has been blasted,<br>
 the left eye straight ahead,<br>
 as wide open animal jaws howl at her earless head,<br>
 the right eye more inward, averted,<br>
 reflecting on what pirate-midwife is hissing-<br><br>
 
 to her left, beyond the Child,<br>
 a sketchy, wraith-like creature, at attention,<br>
 facing her, seems to be tooting or snout-firing into her face,<br>
 or is he vying for her attention with pirate-midwife?<br>
 She whose body is her retinue,<br>
 She who is slaughtered<br>
 at the beginning of time, sets time in motion,<br>
 whose crate-shaped upper body<br>
 contains, like huge pods, food for those<br>
 putting on her body,<br>

 cut off her head,<br>
 which was left abandoned<br>
 on the slopes of Coatepetl.<br>
 The body of Coyolxauhqui<br>
 went rolling down<br>
 as it fell, dismembered,<br>
 in different places fell her hands,<br>
 her legs, her body..."<br>
