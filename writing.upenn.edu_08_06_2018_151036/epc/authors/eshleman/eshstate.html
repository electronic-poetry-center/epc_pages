"The invention of the historical other has become almost programmatic
in twentieth-century American poetry; for Pound, ancient China; for
H.D., classical Greece; for Olson, Mesopotamia; for Snyder, the
Neolithic, Eshleman has pushed the historical back about as far as it
can go: to the Upper Paleolithic, and the earliest surviving images
made by humans. As a result of his literal and imaginative
explorations of the painted and gouged caves, Eshleman has constructed
a myth, perhaps the first compelling post-Darwinian myth: that the
Paleolithic represents the "crisis" of the human "separating out" of
the animal, the original birth and original fall of man. From that
moment, human history spins out: from the repression of the animal
within to the current extinction of the animals without; the inversion
from matriarchy to patriarchy, and the denial of the feminine; the
transformation of the fecund underworld into the Hell of suffering;
and the rising of Hell, in the twentieth century to the surface of the
earth: Dachau, Hiroshima. The poet's journey is an archetypal scenario
of descent and rebirth: he has traveled to the origin of humanness to
reach the millennium, end and beginning."

important literary magazine which has explored and extended the
boundaries of poetry. Clayton Eshleman has had a nose for smelling out
what was going to happen next in the ceaseless evolution of the art."<P>

"This, the first National Book Award to be given to a translation of
modern poetry, is a recognition of Clayton Eshleman's seventeen year
apprenticeship to perhaps the most difficult poetry in the Spanish
language. Eshleman, by rendering these complex poems into brilliant and
living English, has also made a considerable addition to poetry in our
language."<P>
