<p><b>Biography</b></p>
<p>Eileen Myles was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1949, educated in catholic schools, graduated from U. Mass  (Boston) in 1971, and moved to New York City in 1974 to be a poet. Her  formal poetic education began at St. Mark's Poetry Project, where workshops  were led by Alice Notley, Ted Berrigan, and others. Myles  first became known to many Americans through her openly female write-in  campaign for President of the United States in 1991-92. She has been  described as &quot;one of the savviest and most restless intellects in  contemporary literature,&quot; and publications  include Not Me (1991),  Chelsea Girls (1994),  Cool for You (2000),  Skies (2001),  and Sorry Tree (2007).  &nbsp;In 2010 she was awarded a  Warhol/Creative Capital Grant to write<em> The Importance of Being Iceland</em>,  a collection of art and travel essays. <em>Inferno (a poet's novel)</em> received  a 2011 Lambda Award and was described by John Ashbery  as &ldquo;zingingly funny and melancholy.&rdquo; Her most recent collection of  poetry is <em>Snowflake/different streets</em>. She is a 2012 Guggenheim Fellow  for a forthcoming work of nonfiction, <em>Afterglow</em>.</p>
