style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Arial'>ALAN DAVIES – PART E – CURRICULUM
    VITAE</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Alan Davies attended high school in
    Newfoundland, where he started both a student newspaper and a literary
    magazine.  He attended Atlantic Union
    College in rural Massachusetts, where he was editor of a newspaper, literary
    editor of the yearbook, and twice president of the student council.  He was regularly published in the literary magazine
    and successfully published and marketed a book by a fellow poet.  He received the Rochelle P. Kilgore Prize
    for Poetry.  He graduated cum laude in
    1972, with departmental honors in English.</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Alan Studied with Robert Creeley at
    Harvard University during the summer of 1972.  The course was entitled Readings in Modern Poetry.  While he was alive Robert Creeley continued
    to support Alan’s work, recommending him several times for grants.  Alan met at that time a number of poets in
    the generation ahead of him, and particularly befriended John Wieners, with
    whom he was friends for many years, and from whom he learned a great deal.</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>He started the poetry magazine A
    Hundred Posters, of which nearly fifty issues were published over the next
    couple of years.  Three issues of
    Oculist Witnesses were also published.  And he began to edit and publish the press called Other Publications.</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>He also took a couple of classes that
    Octavio Paz taught at Harvard.  The
    courses dealt with the intricacies of surrealism and with other concerns as Mr.
    Paz experienced and saw them.  Mr. Paz
    was also kind enough to positively critique Alan’s writing.</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Alan began to have his own work published
    regularly.  His books began to appear
    (see list of publications) and he wrote extensively for many literary
    magazines.  His writing included book
    reviews, critical essays, aphorisms, and other literary forms, as well as
    poetry.  </span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>During the summer of 1977 he was
    assistant to Anne Waldman and Allen Ginsberg, co-directors of The Jack Kerouac
    School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado.  His responsibilities included coordinating
    such events as student workshops and readings.  He took a course with William Burroughs there, and attended many
    readings and workshops.  He became
    friendly with many other writers who taught at or otherwise passed through that
    literary milieu.</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>In New York City he became familiar
    with and befriended his literary peers, with whom he gave and organized
    readings, published books and magazines, and about many of whom he wrote in his
    critical articles and book reviews.  He
    read and lectured widely, both in the United States and Canada.  He was invited to participate in a literary
    conference in Tenerife in the Canary Islands, the focus of which was
    contemporary Canadian poetry.</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>He has continued to write and to
    publish, with his long-anticipated book LIFE expected later this year.  Sections of an ongoing project, projected to
    be lifelong, have been published, and another section is slated for publication
    late in 2006.  And more articles are
    about to be published as well.</span></b></p>
