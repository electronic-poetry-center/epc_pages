<H2>At North Farm</H2> <P>

<br>



Somewhere someone is traveling furiously toward you, <br>
At incredible speed, traveling day and night,<br>
Through blizzards and desert heat, across torrents, through narrow passes.<br>
But will he know where to find you,<br>
Recognize you when he sees you,<br>
Give you the thing he has for you?<br>
<br>

Hardly anything grows here,<br>
Yet the granaries are bursting with meal,<br>
The sacks of meal piled to the rafters.<br>
The streams run with sweetness, fattening fish;<br>
Birds darken the sky.  Is it enough<br>
That the dish of milk is set out at night,<br>
That we think of him sometimes,<br>
Sometimes and always, with mixed feelings?<br>

<br>
<br>
