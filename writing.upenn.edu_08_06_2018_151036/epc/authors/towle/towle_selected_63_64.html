        all true actors  have. By our mere presence on a stage<br />

        a regular meal  in months; I&rsquo;m always scared when I&rsquo;m writing.<br />
        Is it like that  for other writers? I don&rsquo;t know. Again,<br />
        how did you  feel when you were writing this work? The scene<br />
        shifts to a  nearby room. But there the comparison ends; there<br />
        the violence is  aimless, without any clear purpose. In a larger<br />
        sense it is not  even satisfactory acting. Do you no longer<br />
        feel that this  is possible in a weekly series? I tried to<br />
        bring the  series to a meaningful end. And then the series<br />
        would be over?  I wrote a number of stories for the series.<br />
        She will be a  crazy American girl who becomes involved. That<br />
        is the way we  think. Our people all have entertainment value.</font></p>

        of the New Year. In the  north<br />
        there is snow and ice  and the forest rings<br />
        with the sound of the  ax.<br />
        So this is really a game  of tag. Run across it<br />
        as if it were a cake,  and you were the knife<br />
        cutting it through the  middle. At other times<br />
        the clouds seem to be  pillows. My target<br />

        We wanted to pull it  down from the sky with a rope,<br />
        or across the sky, in a  boat. We know how to find<br />
        the east. The east is  where the sun comes up each morning.<br />
        In the morning we begin  the work. There may be hundreds,<br />
        even thousands, of trees  to chop down. It will be long after dark<br />
        before we can stop and  go home to bed.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later there appears a  third major character. If there is a<br />
        moral diagnosis to be  made, he will make it. His<br />
        is a cultivated mind,  willing to bend to the work at hand.<br />
        Turn on a lamp and  pretend it is the sun. Put a ball<br />
        on a plate: this is the  earth, where you live. A revolution<br />
        is sweeping across its  surface. Each speck is a thousand animals;<br />
        they feel as if they  were falling into the sun.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today I reached a  decision that most people wouldn&rsquo;t understand.<br />
        Earlier I had lunch with  another American. She was<br />
        the best-dressed  American I have ever seen. Press a feather<br />
        into the spot; you can&rsquo;t  feel it, the feather floats off.<br />
        It&rsquo;s a lonely, nothing  kind of day. One of the best things<br />
        is to help with the  woodcutting. This means walking through<br />
        the woods to find the  right kind of trees. Then comes<br />
        the wonderful sound of  the ax. The winter&rsquo;s woodcutting<br />
        has only just  begun. There will be chopping for days,<br />
        even weeks. We  could not keep track of the days unless<br />
        there were some  sort of system. It is hard to maintain interest<br />
        from day to day,  so there must be some frequent surprise.<br />
        Turn your  attention elsewhere and give them time<br />
        to wonder about  you. What insane mission are you planning<br />
        this time? I  knelt over her limp form. For those of you<br />
        who are slow,  let me spell it out. We need a fresh view of the<br />
        heavy drinker.  He suffers from anxiety and often has feelings<br />
        of inferiority  and insecurity. His tolerance of frustration<br />
        is low. He feels  lonely, isolated, and dependent. He is<br />
        frequently beset  with hostility and depression. Often he has not<br />
        had a carefree  childhood and, paradoxically, drinking may not be <br />
        the main  problem. It is an unbelievable adventure that strains<br />
        ordinary belief.  It became impossible to control the children&rsquo;s <br />
        movements. A  terrific crash brought me out of my reverie. The <br />
        important thing  now was to stay alive. The prisoner was the most<br />
        beautiful girl I  had ever seen. Only cowards would make prisoners<br />
        of defenseless  women and children. They swarmed over the rail.<br />
        Their menacing  hand grenades look and work just like real ones.<br />
        I ran so hard I  thought my legs would fall off. I&rsquo;ve been<br />
        plagued with  unhappiness from the day I was born. I felt the<br />
        tug of hands and  the blur of voices. Somehow I looked better<br />
        than ever the  next morning. Using radio would have been<br />
        like talking  through a long pipe filled with sponges: the message<br />
        would have been  soaked up a few feet from its starting point.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After they are  trapped the real work begins. They are taken out,<br />
  one by one,  unprepared for what they see. They hear a disturbingly<br />
        human voice, a  pretentious expansion of significance. But his<br />
        convictions are  a form of sentimental weakness, no matter how<br />
        strongly they  are pressed. My dreams verified the fact over<br />
        and over again.  I am asked why I keep living here; my choice<br />
        of companions  will lead directly to scandal. I&rsquo;d hate to be in a room<br />
        and hear the  comments after I leave. There is a spontaneous<br />
        demonstration of  approval. A reputation is a pretty important thing<br />
        to have,  although superstitious people have been known to turn pale<br />
        at such a  prospect, regarding it as an omen of approaching death.<br />
        Beautiful, you  win again. There is another spontaneous<br />
        demonstration of  approval. Indeed, only one fact, repeated in all<br />
        ten stories,  kept me from seeming like a cardboard cutout. An <br />
        amused snort  comes from another bar stool. It is that quiet time,<br />
        just before  dinner. I opened the door and there began a long<br />
        friendship. I  suppose she vaguely sensed the embryonic poet,<br />
        or mystic. The  thought sustains me during the hot sticky ride.<br />
        It&rsquo;s fun to  flirt but it can be dangerous. I have glib relationships <br />
        because there is  so much to joke about.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not rock  bottom that I touch here. The silent shroud of<br />
  night engulfs  the distant mountains and a sudden brightnes<em>s</em><br />
        numbs my senses.  Let us now assume our rightful forms. How<br />
        wonderful it is  to conjure up a simple spell. It is interesting<br />
        to see how his  enthusiasm is revealed. He enjoys letting his mind<br />
        roam the  universe. A desire for variety is also revealed,<br />
        according to a  survey of some 1500 people. Most of them<br />
        will be led off  to jail, protesting their innocence. Shifting its<br />
        sights, the  survey asks if we can see more clearly than those<br />
        who had come  before us &mdash; but now there is a rising in the sky.<br />
        Gold and silver  make their appearance. Everything is destroyed in <br />
        our path but our  enemies bounce back continually. Here<br />
        is a palace, but  it has been put up wrong. There the pirates<br />
        make their  quarters. Most of their suggestions require little or no<br />
        equipment,  merely the simple materials available in your home.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These imperfect  duplicates of me think in reverse. I usually<br />
        have to cuff  their heads to get any sense out of them at all. Most<br />
        of the time they  are busy getting rid of flies and other troublesome<br />
        pests, which  makes them of some help. Why are you so angry? My<br />
        thinking is so  zany it&rsquo;s not worth worrying about. I am speaking<br />
        for the  community as a whole. There are so many things to do that <br />
        everyone can  find something to like. I came back feeling weak. You<br />
        get tired of  jumping from ice floe to ice floe. It&rsquo;s like living in the <br />
        middle of a TNT  sandwich, or between the claws of a pair of <br />
        tigers. In the  meantime I&rsquo;ll put on that demonstration I promised. <br />
        The dancers go  on hour after hour. Finally at sundown they file away. <br />
        The most  striking features are the vast empty spaces that come at <br />
        the end of the  year. In general our calendar is an unnecessary <br />
        hardship, with  an unjustifiable nuisance value in a world already <br />
        dumb with chaos.  Violence and tumult are the hallmarks of our age <br />
        and we may  expect widespread disease and catastrophe; while at the <br />
        same time people  everywhere resist exploitation and look forward to<br />
        liberation. So  the generals, ours and theirs, remain important to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I quit staring  into her eyes and gazed elsewhere. A car pulled up and<br />
        a few of us  laughed, but nobody thought it was particularly unusual.<br />
        The curtains  parted and a woman stepped out, followed by a dwarf <br />
        in livery. We  were frozen in horror; the plane had become a luxurious <br />
        bedroom on  wings. The door slammed and a second woman entered. <br />
        I took an  astonished look. I was lost in a sea of generalized sensuality. <br />
        The wind  whistled in my ears. I landed in a field next to Lake Erie. <br />
        One telephone  operator, in New Jersey, chased more than eight men. <br />
        There are over  21 million mateless women in circulation. I told him<br />
        that to me the  whole story seemed very sad, and that virtually nothing <br />
        was being done  to stop this. I summed up the growing concern: Many <br />
        of these people  develop suicidal tendencies and no one is willing to <br />
        take a firm&nbsp; stand. She leaped at him, clawing at his  eyes. He took off <br />
        his jacket and  his shirt. Afterwards, the midgets dispersed, returning <br />
        to their former  lives. They thought he was dead but didn&rsquo;t give a damn.<br />
        I knew I would  have to stay around for several days to explain things, <br />
        but I was  determined to enjoy it. A flame reached out and held me. I <br />
        have always had  to fight for my bits of glory. Still dazed, I was backed <br />
        up against a  wall. Then comes a tragic farewell, with ranting and<br />
        weeping as we go  into exile. I am sick of my life. The war has robbed <br />
        it of all that a  young man could find of happiness. Mercifully, I can <br />
        buy love when I  require it. Three charming creatures are coming to <br />
        have tea with me  today. When I have finished with these three, I will <br />
        dissect them.  The lady&rsquo;s part is the same. There is a constant inertia; the<br />
        man steps back.  From this position the woman is at the starting point <br />
        of her whirl.  This is the second step. The third step is far more simple. <br />
        There are eight  steps in all. We are taught to start at top speed and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        continue that  way as long as possible. But even after the opponent<br />
        has conceded,  there are no provisions for preventing the winner<br />
        from further  kicking and beating the loser. Is this one of the <br />
        symptoms of love  again? Not unexpectedly it became the highpoint <br />
        of the  youngster&rsquo;s week. Would you pick this young man to be <br />
        your leader? Or  this one? Their train is due in St. Louis tomorrow.<br />
        We are all  travelers now, and are beyond the point when a<br />
        destination  could surprise us.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We continue to  watch the leaves on the trees. We watch the <br />
  birds and the  animals. We think of the day as having two parts,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        morning and  afternoon. The night also has two parts: the evening,<br />
        and later, when  it is completely dark. Such observations are<br />
        bound to be  rhapsodic. We laughed our terrible laughs together. <br />
        I would like to  see those girls in action. Was some nerve being <br />
        touched by the  new treatment? I wrote those words as an exact <br />
        reflection of my  thoughts. You see, we have become so complicated. <br />
        How I love  Versailles. Apparently I will end up in the restaurant <br />
        business. I  don&rsquo;t see the connection. What do you do if you can&rsquo;t <br />
        get any further  information?</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The storm broke  and the protest showered down. Newspapers,<br />
  magazines, and  commentators took up the cudgels. They looked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  at no fewer than  half a million photographs, most of them in color<br />
        The hero is  speaking. There is no emotion in his voice as he tells the<br />
        story. He often  has an unexpected innocence, unique and refreshing<br />
        in the stifling,  pompous world in which he functions. I tend to be<br />
        skeptical of  claims to heroism but I am terribly responsive to them. <br />
        It can be  inspiring to see man struggling with nature, but even more<br />
        inspiring to see  him struggling with his fate. A typhoon burst with <br />
        sudden fury. A  herd of buffalo stops the train. The train was winding <br />
        its way through the  mountains. Mere buffalo were able to stop a train. <br />
        I did not know  the identity of the animals but I was annoyed with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        them. Why does  war have to take out its fury on innocent people?<br />
        The men charged  into the village. I found a girl, wounded and <br />
        unconscious. We  talked for a long time. The days were bright and <br />
        mild. Sightseers  came and went. Laboriously, I plodded along. It was <br />
        a book. I saw  myself leaning over it, struggling to keep awake. I had <br />
        other books, in  case the first one failed. I went to the bookcase, <br />
        playing the  scene the same way all my predecessors had played it.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New York is the  endless celebration of everything. It is better to<br />
        learn this rule  at the beginning. I opened the window and breathed <br />
        in the dark  night. I consider everyone a possible antagonist, so the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        less said to  anyone the better. Such tensions are not new. These<br />
        things are all  in a day&rsquo;s work. Yet there are certain moments of crisis, <br />
        as in his wife&rsquo;s  death. You are confusing two different specialties. <br />
        We were supposed  to have ended up with a beautiful girl or <br />
        an accomplished  wrestler. The mayor&rsquo;s car fell apart when he stepped <br />
        on the  accelerator. It&rsquo;s the best practical joke I&rsquo;ve played in weeks. <br />
        Flowers of  varying shapes and sizes swept over seas of elegant fabric. <br />
        The final  results are a work that did not set out to please. But what <br />
        about my  problem? I keep breaking these metallic strands but they <br />
        keep sticking to  me. I&rsquo;ll just wander around, maybe for years, <br />
        seeking a  solution. He probably fell out of a passing plane. Let&rsquo;s see<br />
        how he looks as  an adult.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I wonder if in  the years to come we will remember the strange<br />
  recklessness  that has developed in almost everyone&rsquo;s mentality.<br />
        His cousin raped  her and cut out her tongue. Her murderous<br />
        animal madness  is the sign of his entering into her. Primitive<br />
        actions that  bypassed consciousness drew them to the verge of <br />
        death. Now there  is nothing wrong with this as far as it goes. <br />
        The poem, then,  has its seriousness. All life is charged with <br />
        emotion, we  can&rsquo;t get away from it. Emotion should make life <br />
        enjoyable but  more often makes it miserable. Emotion is so <br />
        powerful that it  can greatly warp our reason. There arises within <br />
        us a conflict  that vastly disturbs us. Here is the man of fifty-four <br />
        looking back on  the man of thirty-one. Yet, for all my energy <br />
        as a salesman, I  am essentially a stiff, shy man. This shyness <br />
        was put to a  severe test a few years ago.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact I am  restless and rather unhappy, although I have been<br />
        fortunate in all  matters. I have no problem in getting a job and<br />
        holding it. At  times it is difficult to project a warm image to others.<br />
        At times  resentment is the only thing you can clearly project. The<br />
        tendency is to  feel sorry for yourself, because your problems are<br />
        unending and  unendurable. Further, your vision and consciousness <br />
        may be deeply  shaken, invaded, or poisoned by the eruption of <br />
        unconscious  forces. Powerful storms of emotions may turn you, <br />
        your  environment, and your entire nation into a chaotic maelstrom. <br />
        You may feel up  in the air over circumstances, out of touch with <br />
        developments.  You are always being given a chance to show your <br />
        ability and  always failing miserably. Every day is a carnival of looting <br />
        and stealing. I  can see everything taking place but I can&rsquo;t make a <br />
        move to stop it,  not even to protect the girl I love. Heroes put a great <br />
        strain on their  hearts when they go through the movements necessary<br />
        for their deeds.  The day has turned clear and sunny. If enemy planes <br />
        are nearby they  can see and attack us. The book I intend to write<br />
        about it should  be a sellout, all profits going to the local hospital.<br />
        When I started  the project I wanted to be friendly, but circumstances<br />
        prevailed that  made me the opposite, ominous and hostile. Let&rsquo;s not<br />
        lose our heads;  all this may just be a prearranged film to shock us.<br />
        I feel as if I  were circling the earth. The craft screeches to a stop.<br />
        Such an  adventure obviously limits the number of participants. One<br />
        sight after  another fills our eyes. Architects plan and supervise the<br />
        construction of  buildings. Dress designers originate new styles in<br />
        clothing. A  dress designer must have a thorough knowledge of fabrics, <br />
        an alertness to  fashions, and an understanding of manufacturing<br />
        processes. A  talent for sketching and creative design are also<br />
        essential.  Gradually an imposing structure takes shape. In the<br />
        meantime there  is no spiritual agony being felt. Each chair has its<br />
        own wiring.  There is also a cruel stepmother. I could not close my<br />
        eyes for a  second. The bicycle ran into a tree. It will teach me a <br />
        good lesson. I  am the same person that was here yesterday. I <br />
        continued my  course along the bank of the river. I am out of the<br />
        the safety zone.  A pool was found but the water was thick and<br />
        muddy. The town  was burnt and day before and the great tower <br />
        bore down on us.  I moved back a space. I must tell you how terrific <br />
        you are and I  must give you a suggestion.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly I found  myself doing&nbsp; just as I pleased and the  whole <br />
        world was  beaming unquestioning approval. Ah, two more little <br />
        guests. Is there  any way of getting a note down to the kitchen? She <br />
        says our beds  used to be barber&rsquo;s chairs and I say they were <br />
        steamtables. She  did tell me a good way to remove stoppers from <br />
        glass bottles.  When we want to know that&rsquo;s inside the bottles we go <br />
        to our engineers  and chemists. An instant later I paid the penalty.<br />
        Haven&rsquo;t my  metallic dreams been shattered enough? We took the <br />
        supplies further  up the glacier. This time I will do exactly as I am told. <br />
        I cannot be content  with a picture of human life as a madhouse with <br />
        everybody in  solitary confinement. Why did they insist that I take <br />
        this train? The  dream that was born four years ago was now a reality. <br />
        Is this, by any  chance, some flour that has leaked out of the pillow? <br />
        The second  course came, and with it a bottle of Burgundy. The <br />
        Henry in  question is Henry of Germany. All of them were present <br />
        at the election  of the new pope. In their world, as in ours, charging <br />
        animals can be  diverted by fire. The couple waited for children<br />
        but no babies  appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then for the  next decade a child was born every year. Vibration<br />
  was next.&nbsp; They were shot through hollow tubes like  bowling balls.<br />
        Then they were  installed behind the propellers. The whirling action <br />
        carries the  fumes and noise deep in their wake. You can still hear it, <br />
        it gets the word  from your finger. It runs through the snow in an <br />
        erratic manner.  Wet snow begins to pack and build up. Snow is <br />
        thrown to the  right and to the left. The Frenchman&rsquo;s pockets are <br />
        picked. The  Swedish girl is taken for a five-mile cab ride. The Dutch <br />
        girl sat in her  hotel. The Englishman bought two tickets to a show.<br />
        The whole story  was revealed by my partner. No one ever gives him <br />
        an answer. He  sits out on the new grass, looking up at the sky. He <br />
        gazes at the  long, wavering line of ducks. A week later I went for a <br />
        drive. She  grabbed me and we whirled around the room. Then I saw <br />
        my chance. A  kiss fell onto my head. A voice was raw and harsh <br />
        against my ear.  She finally freed herself, shaken by emotion. She <br />
        thought she&rsquo;d  like to lie on her back for a while. The similarity <br />
        continued. In  fact the screams woke us up. They should have put <br />
        those things in  a container. A volley of lead is released and darkness <br />
        blankets the town.  Relax, I&rsquo;ve got all my faculties. Not only that, but<br />
        I&rsquo;m beginning to  recall my animal past. Instantly my joy gave way to <br />
        a kind of humble  awe. Perhaps the most meaningful answer would be <br />
        that every  doctrine breeds its own antithesis; moods change quickly, <br />
        as everyone  knows. See? The metal bird is coming to life. It swings its <br />
        ugly head toward  us. It refuses to be classified, except as a professional. <br />
        But let&rsquo;s get  going, those tanks aren&rsquo;t made out of cotton candy. That&rsquo;s <br />
        the craziest  thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard of. Not only are you two hours late, <br />
        but what  happened to this portable ice-maker? If we&rsquo;re boring you, <br />
        Captain, I  suggest you leave the country at once. After a few hours in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        the lap of  luxury I begin to yawn. You&rsquo;ve got the picture slightly <br />
        blurred,  Colonel, the whole stinking place is deserted.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spite of  Milwaukee&rsquo;s phenomenal growth, it has kept a relaxed and<br />
        congenial  atmosphere. St. Paul, too, is a city of remarkable contrasts.<br />
        There is an  inviting international flavor about El Paso. Many of its<br />
        inhabitants  speak Spanish. A region, in almost all instances, consists<br />
        of a town or a  city, plus the surrounding area. This limitation in size<br />
        makes it  possible to call on everyone in the area, the reason for<br />
        establishing a  region in the first place. His leathery face broke into a <br />
        wide smile. A  knife went past my head and clanged to the dance floor.<br />
        The facts have  been presented, now what will we, the public, do<br />
        about them? We  are helping creative people escape from their ivory<br />
        towers and be  more in tune with actual audiences. Our creative minds<br />
        are learning  more about persuasion, and in time there will be a group<br />
        of creative  people whose failures can be identified before they are<br />
        revealed. One  more fact should be mentioned. The variety of words<br />
        will be  accompanied by a variety of gestures. It leads ahead to a future<br />
        which, to my  elderly eyes, looks remarkably like a golden age of writing.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the end of  the day the plain was covered with mist. The men<br />
  looked upward  into the heavens, and downward, into the green<br />
        depths of the  ocean. They were continually amused and amazed by <br />
        their children&rsquo;s  powers of imagination. As the opera begins, they <br />
        hide in the  shadows and await their chance. The father gives his <br />
        blessing. I  don&rsquo;t know whether you are tired or afraid but you are not <br />
        like your  father. The voice was like fifty people shouting together. <br />
        Of the two men,  one was dead by the time the car sank into the mud.<br />
        When the car  topples over the bridge, I brace myself for the shock <br />
        of contact. As  the car lands, I shift my weight to my left foot. I am <br />
        chilled by the  water but eventually reach the shore. There is a pleasant <br />
        ending to this  story. I continued my experiments and published the<br />
        results. I also  inherited my father&rsquo;s fortune, but gave a large part of it <br />
        away, aiding men  of genius. Soon I will roam the continent, in <br />
        search of some  great doctor.</font></p>

        All my life I  have been engaged in amateur theatricals, but have<br />
        never been able  to land a paying job. I am nearly without hope<br />
        that this cycle  will end. When can I get an answer to my medical<br />
        problems? I am  miserable in this snake pit and wonder if I will ever<br />
        get out of it.  Children should not be brought up in this atmosphere<br />
        When she  returns, everything is upset. She has been dragged down<br />
        to utter  despondency by the continual indignities to which she has<br />
        been subjected.  Is there any indication of a letup in the tensions<br />
        that drive her  so mercilessly? Much of our brilliant poetry is<br />
        merely  egocentric. I wonder if we will become as unmanageable<br />

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fighting  continues. Days become weeks. We escorted our <br />
        miniature army  down the street. There are many who believe that I <br />
        exceed my  brother&rsquo;s viciousness. That&rsquo;s not surprising. I have four <br />
        jobs. I&rsquo;m glad  to go along with her whims. That&rsquo;s what lovers are for. <br />
        They loom up  from the sea, dripping salt water and seaweed. <br />
        Sometimes the  worst kind of love is the best. Take another look. <br />
        There are two  giant battlefields, on a globe that spins so smoothly <br />
        and steadily  that we never notice it is spinning at all. Take two or <br />
        three turns around.  It all started with a few simple rules that we, <br />
        the children and  I, discussed and decided were good ones. We have <br />
        always lived and  acted within a horizon. Sometimes we are hungry <br />
        and leave to get  food. But listen &mdash; we are being attacked by a double-<br />
        stage rocket and  the warhead is bearing down on us. Are we good<br />
        enough to  survive? An hour later I slipped into the little Alpine village. <br />
        I looked back  and squinted at the dazzling mountainside. I climbed <br />
        further up,  until my wings seemed to burn in the thin, frigid air. My <br />
        legs turned to  icicles. A blurred form flashed by me. I followed it to <br />
        the edge of the  mysterious depths, where no one had ventured before.</font></p>

        crumpled up  against the side of the mountain. We need another<br />
        arrangement to  land on a point. Since master jewel thieves are<br />
        rarely caught,  it is impossible to generalize much about them. How&nbsp;<br />

        I eat my  sandwich and sip my coffee. The girl looks stranded. It&rsquo;s<br />
        a flat tire, and  no one in sight to help her change it. Her chateau,<br />
        it seems, will  soon be put up for auction. Gradually the old ways <br />
        are changing.  When not singing, she sat at my table, or we danced<br />
        on the few feet  of crowded dance floor. One needed only a glance<br />
        to ascertain the  omnipresence of sexual desire. Expenditures, too,<br />
        are liable to  explode. Or they can be cut completely and lowered<br />
        into the ground.  Each year, death strikes down some of our finest<br />
        thinkers. They  had been providing the simple truths men needed to<br />
        live in a  tortured world. I didn&rsquo;t want to break the mood so I just<br />
        left them alone.  At the end, a brick arch is left where the structure<br />

        needs. They feel  that if enemy planes see them today, they will be <br />
        able to fly fast  enough to get away. Below, the railroad train has been<br />
        thrown off its  tracks. The railroad tracks are torn up and will have <br />
        to be rebuilt. I  write another note. It too drops with its parachute. <br />
        The fire  fighters go off in different directions. They are careful as <br />
        they near the  clouds of smoke. They like jam, but no one will make it <br />
        for them. The  hotel is also on fire. Bombs hit the roof and fall inside. <br />
        Leaves and twigs  fall to the ground and catch fire. It will take many <br />
        men to keep the  blaze from spreading. A single plane ticket changes <br />
        hands. The book,  in two volumes, contains the outpourings of a<br />
        lonely man in  high authority. It is sad, resigned, and carries the <br />
        self-imposed  burden of his family. His successors found themselves <br />
        in an awkward  dilemma. The climate was set for an increase of <br />
        tension and  misunderstanding, and reactions, as usual, were varied.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hot lava flooded  my every muscle. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible. Then <br />
        the mountain of  lava flooded over me again, holding me captive.<br />
        When I awoke,  the lava flooded over me again. Nothing had been <br />
        solved by this  hot interlude, I felt the same as ever. Often I am torn by <br />
        a passion. Also,  I am capable of inventing a passion. To which passions<br />
        does he refer?  Certainly he didn&rsquo;t mean we were to have been perfect <br />
        in body and  mind. Not even our inclinations are perfect. If they were,<br />
        they would not  continually tend to lead us astray. Another ticket <br />
        changes hands.  There is only one possible way out of the diabolic trap <br />
        I&rsquo;m in. You  might wonder why anyone would want to trap me in this <br />
        situation. Why  not simply use a gun? Deep down I feel that I may get <br />
        into a trap like  that and I won&rsquo;t be able to escape. How can I explain <br />
        my hunch that  this terrible idea will come true? Innocent-looking <br />
        floorboards give  way and I can&rsquo;t stop my fall. After it was over they <br />
        took my uniform  away. I&rsquo;m glad you had a good time last night. The <br />
        ants put on a  fascinating show that enthralled me for hours. Ants are&nbsp; <br />
        actually the  world&rsquo;s tiniest construction engineers. Maybe I&rsquo;m secretly<br />
        hoping to be  captured. If so, there&rsquo;s hope for me. Am I really a <br />
        criminal at  heart? I&rsquo;m ready to carry out the most sensational act of <br />
        my criminal  career. The octopus is going to take over the ship and <br />
        the captain is  already acting like an octopus. Whoever recovers first <br />
        is bound to win  this deadly game. Something else emerges from <br />
        the undersea  cavern. A thrilling mechanical rescue takes place. The <br />
        machines strain  every nut and bolt to carry out my commands. But <br />
        what about all  these fish? We&rsquo;ll just use them for experiments. Half <br />
        our mission is  complete: they act as if they&rsquo;ve lost their minds. A plank <br />
        is extended to  our ship. It worked! The fish are taking me for a ride.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Somehow we  cannot come up with a clear definition from all this. <br />
        The human mind  always works along the lines of a plan, from which <br />
        we may conclude  that we are not capable of discovering the truth <br />
        about the  universe. There is nothing to avert this suspicion. He&rsquo;s right; <br />
        I can&rsquo;t move a  muscle. Here, hold the phone next to the carpet. I&rsquo;d <br />
        like to have  this carpet cleaned. But right now I&rsquo;m going to climb. I <br />
        may spend the rest  of my days in the mountains. Each time I peer <br />
        through the  lenses I see an incredible vision I have never seen before. <br />
        A moment later  the unbelievable happened. I would like to share it <br />
        with you. Then  it occurred to me that I can&rsquo;t tell you the truth. There<br />
        is only one way  to confirm my fears. A blinding flash jarred me to <br />
        my senses. My  hands tensed and I found the answer. I think I&rsquo;ve had <br />
        enough double  vision to last a lifetime. A cry was heard and a second <br />
        shock hit me.  They were both aliens and one was trying to kill the other.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hair  sparkles in the natural light of the snowfall. Holidays are<br />
        wonderful times.  Having fun is an investment. Why not exploit the <br />
        idea further?  I&rsquo;ve never had so much fun in all my life. It is the major <br />
        problem that  confronts me in my relationship to others. It is an <br />
        affront to  esthetics, to human relationships, and to nature. I need <br />
        nature to help  me have a sane idea of life. I clung to her breathlessly.<br />
        Love is a  popular word in a teenager&rsquo;s vocabulary, but few teenagers <br />
        know what real  love is. Many confuse love with lust. Lusting teenagers <br />
        have brought  about conditions that shock every sense of decency. A <br />
        wave of sexual  promiscuity is sweeping across America and the world. <br />
        People are being  swept up into an orbit of overpowering passion, <br />
        using every  trick in the book. Then one day the world comes crashing <br />
        down. If they  were to get married now, they would be trusting a <br />
        great deal of  their future happiness to luck. What can they do for <br />
        inexpensive  amusement? Most of their friends will be away for the <br />
        summer. There  must be a way out. I&rsquo;ve admitted I&rsquo;m shy. I keep quiet <br />
        because I know  I&rsquo;ll say the wrong thing. The scene might have taken <br />
        place only  yesterday. Few realize that harsh words are termites that can <br />
        undermine the  foundation of a happy home. I mingle with hundreds <br />
        of people every  day, listen to their problems, and hear their hearts cry <br />
        out wistfully  for friendship and love. They roll over and over, trying <br />
        to devour each  other with lust. At the end she gives out a high, ear-<br />
        splitting  scream. Silently she cursed herself for being such a fool. No, <br />
        by happiness I  mean the everyday enjoyment of everyday people. But <br />
        concentrate on  one thing at a time. First attain financial independence, <br />
        as that is the  goal for which you are striving.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course she loves me  in spite of my eccentricities. Our bodies need <br />
        exercise just as they  need food. They plumb the unknown and the <br />
        rest of us soon follow.  The ordeal started on a Friday morning. In its <br />
        worst form it can  resemble a nightmare but it does not necessarily <br />
        kill people. It is  convincing and emotionally gripping. One can find in it <br />
        a degree of solace, and  perhaps new friends and a pleasurable sense <br />
        of freedom in the  rolling countryside. Both women plan to keep their <br />
        coats on. The spotlit  center of my reverie is basically the same as its <br />
        periphery. It brings me  back to the landscapes of Europe, the girl, and <br />
        the memory of the  battle. We drive steadily upward. The following<br />
        day we picked up three  horses near a stream. Afterwards we were to <br />
        be found in the caf&eacute;,  celebrating. It is the Paris of 1740. Her condition <br />
        is becoming worse  instead of better. Tragedy will stalk her until her <br />
        death. Not many people  would take a chance with the future the way <br />
        she did. It is amusing  to note the way a person will free himself of all <br />
        encumbrances. Even a  small child will wriggle out of its mother&rsquo;s arms. <br />
        One mother found herself  wedded to an unfaithful husband. Another found <br />
        a large sum of money.  When it was spent she looked at her watch and the <br />
        kitchen clock. Let us  seek the answer from the stars in the sky.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before the  dozing me knew what was happening, the girl began firing.<br />
        What does this  girl have to look forward to? I still love her and <br />
        would like to  see her straightened out. She insists on telling fabulous <br />
        lies. Her course  of action has given me migraine and ulcers. She swore <br />
        again and turned  away, pretending to be deeply hurt. To this day, she <br />
        maintains a  red-faced silence. In an instant they changed from warm, <br />
        vulnerable girls  to cold women, fiercely bent on vengeance. But, as for <br />
        the fighting,  that was reserved for the men. The men chuckled, satisfied. <br />
        They were almost  at the bus stop before they saw the shadows in the <br />
        doorway. She  slapped the other girl again. At first it hardly changed <br />
        her way of life.  Then she relented and told me practically everything. I<br />
        tore my eyes  from where I was looking. Her face had grown broad and<br />
        fleshy. The  three of us had been at the waterfront, indulging in our <br />
        favorite  pastime. Suddenly there was a tap on my shoulder. Although <br />
        this reminded me  of the previous occasion, I reacted quite differently. I <br />
        saw the callused  hand clapped over her mouth. The sputtering girl was <br />
        picked up and  carried off. I am experiencing another strange sensation. <br />
        The effect of  the eggs must be wearing off. Here, consume as many eggs <br />
      as you can. I  felt nothing until I had devoured the food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a moment the  storm ceased, the waves went down, and our boat <br />
  drifted to land,  just in front of our father&rsquo;s castle. The doors and<br />
        windows were  watched by officers and students with arm bands. <br />
        Most of the  first week has been spent in violent debate. Then the <br />
        idea of having  committees was put forward. The first thing I was <br />
        set to do was to  sort feathers. I did not run away to a lonely tower <br />
        and write poetry  when the revolution demanded journalism. I was <br />
        on an adventure,  sweeping into history at the head of the people, <br />
        and staking  everything on their vast and simple desires. Reviewing <br />
        my own life, are  there other occasions when I achieved what I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        wanted because  of unusual persistence on my part? You see, most <br />
        people don&rsquo;t  realize that their subconscious forces can do more for<br />
        them than all the  conscious effort they can squeeze into a 24-hour <br />
        day. Take the  first step and the mind will mobilize all its forces to <br />
        your aid. Not  reason but emotion is the dominating factor in mobilizing <br />
        a people&rsquo;s mind  for war, or for the all-out effort to <br />
        prevent war. Not  art but actuality is the surest method of guiding <br />
        emotion into the  desired channels. Not abstraction but realism is <br />
        the tool that  follows the proper avenues in bringing the nation to the <br />
        emotional pitch  we are seeking. Pictures make the quickest, most &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        vivid, most  searing of all possible impressions. They all suffer from <br />
        lack of size,  but they carry a message no one can miss, and no one<br />
        need look twice  to absorb it. There is no confusion here. In the meantime <br />
        the machinery is  being utilized and the land is being &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        improved. Action  is certainly the order of the day, and action never<br />
        had a better interpreter than the skillfully handled camera. </font></p>
