        encircled by rows of  shimmering diamonds,<br />
        walking, feeling prosperous  and losing weight,<br />
        to the Morgan Library. For  young people there was a pin,<br />
        expressing love in simple  cascades of diamonds,<br />
        on 34th Street<br />
        which we give no relief  walking and walking,<br />
        looking for something to  stick it into,<br />
        women and children first,  apples, walnuts, melons,<br />

        a silver spoon of milky  clouds<br />
        and again I am nourished by  escape.<br />
        a seagull appears at 4  o&rsquo;clock,<br />
        and again at 11, to be  revised<br />
        and ready to attack the page<br />
        through a cement feeling of  infinity.<br />
        In September I gave up  smoking: that<br />
        was moral courage. I go out  into the sleet<br />
        to fetch a dying stranger a  cigarette.<br />
        Coughing and wheezing he  reveals the secret of life:<br />
        yes, it is having moral  courage.<br />
        The world shrinks to the  size of an oyster,<br />
        the museum of sleep opens,<br />
        then grows to the size of a  turtle<br />
        for a splash in the clear  broth of awakening.<br />
        <em>Tart</em> is a variation of the Middle English <em>tarte</em>,<br />
        from the Old French, <em>tourte</em>, a round, low, Latin cake<br />
        devoured on the way to a  woman. If her taste is sharp,<br />
        or tart, then she has come  to you from the Anglo-Saxon, <em>teart</em>.<br />
        I explore the language  compulsively, like Tennyson,<br />
        and exist in it as a story,  like the dictionary,<br />
        told accumulating beneath  the sun<br />
        which I notice with medieval  regularity;<br />
        but again I escape,<br />
        in digression on this lovely  hill<br />
        above the rape of the  country.<br />
        It takes a long time to write,<br />
        and to read, as well. Time  is short, in a way;<br />
        the animal air is a bath, in  a way;<br />
        an animal darts behind a  wall<br />
        and loose stones trouble the  continuing footsteps<br />
        that follow what from the  window<br />
        I can only think of as moral  courage.<br />
        Typing is a variation of  drama, a soft pursuit,<br />
      and I type the words Modern  Theater, too &#8213; patterns<br />

  sitting on a still horizon, moved by a gathering  breeze,<br />
        torn apart in a tempest,<br />
        and by the nerves in the following calm.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At first I boiled the language, like an egg,<br />
        the spirit broken at the insufferable hands of  sociology,<br />

        and I could imagine filling some small need of  literature&rsquo;s<br />
        as well as finally, and in a modest way, my own &#8213;<br />
        a stew of undergrowth and towering oaks.<br />
        From Europe my ancestors headed west, to a certain  point,<br />
        then returned to the east in the logical irony of  opposites,<br />
        to get lost on nature's accordion walls,<br />
        resolved in nature's immortal subterfuge &#8213;</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet I hesitate to give myself dramatic location,<br />
        time without place is my usual location,<br />
        someone from the last century thinking to be in the  preceding one,<br />
        but without really mentioning anything specific<br />
        that happened in those centuries.<br />
        I return to my century and open up Spenser, and the  sun,<br />
        an elevated plum and a demon from the dim past,<br />
        closes an eye on the ocean at sunset,<br />
        dropping from a plate to the carpet of green forest,<br />
        crushing the fragrant spices soaked by torrential  rains,<br />
        echoes to my clinical romanticism<br />
        expressed with wit and a carrot boundary;<br />
        unhappiness, a curve in the river, a bight,<br />
        lemon sharks in the rainbow sunset,<br />
        a cataract of billiard residents<br />
        rolling from their intellectual core.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An eagle lands, for example, on vacation in the  approaching dusk,<br />
  in a simple d&eacute;nouement, a right to the solar plexus,<br />
        delivered like death in the Middle Ages,<br />
        free of rancor and sentimentality;<br />
        and a final d&eacute;nouement,<br />
        a left to the jaw in the soft haze of dusk<br />
        where people even older than I<br />
        can still do marvelous things.<br />
        Of course our bodies are no longer pretty,<br />
        but we can be in fantastic shape<br />
        and can shoot a quick jab to the ribs,<br />
        against a background of orange and yellow streamers,<br />
        to put your thinking in perspective.<br />
        You see, most of us do not use our backs properly,<br />
        they float unused in the body's sea,<br />
        retreat like flights of steps into the earth,<br />
        or mount birds and hurtle through space<br />
        in a universe of misuse &#8213;</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a setting of deserted and elaborate terrain.<br />
        Other things happen during my lifetime;<br />

        a note to Charles North,<br />
        a note to Sylvia Plath,<br />

        discussed in an English aspiring to the grains of  sand,<br />
        trampling the literature until it screams with  hyperbole,<br />
        and generating a confusion unequalled since 1950,<br />
        when I stood in the same place in the playground  next to my school<br />

        and south to the famous crowds on the beach,<br />
        who believe they are wading out toward their  ancestral homes<br />
        in Europe and Africa,<br />

        back from a tour of no less than fifty centuries,<br />
        to collapse on the bed like all the others.<br />
        Indeed, your position can be revealed to the howling  mob<br />

      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Long before 1950 I knew that one of the numerous  years<br />
        would bring death, as 1939 brought life,<br />
        in the way that two poems on universal themes<br />
        open and close an important collection;<br />
        or with a novel, its epigraph and after 600 pages &#8213;<br />
        coming to one's senses and closing it before the  last, the 601st,<br />
        because there are a host of other good books<br />
        to be read, written, and published by far-seeing  publishers,<br />
        who like the authors themselves are high on the  evolutionary scale,<br />
        where death is the occasion for great verbosity,<br />
        which like vegetables from the Massapequa Market<br />
        imparts a healthy glow.<br />
        With Rembrandt, I understand that there is no  history,<br />
        there is only pride, fury, and frustration<br />
        and the glow<br />
        these fevered emotions can impart to my work,<br />
        applied in phrases built up like brushstrokes,<br />
        but apprehended in a sequential structure, like  music;<br />
        there is very little left for poetry itself,<br />
        it is only the core<br />
        on which to hang the mountainous array of  information,<br />
        and which is not gathered from the <em>anguish</em> of life, exactly,<br />
        although it is that very word that has sometimes  shaken my heart,<br />
        verging on the French, as have the English always,<br />
        two percent (2%) less oriental refinement<br />
        due to an arriviste position analogous to Spain's<br />
        and two percent (3%) more Teutonic brooding,<br />
        due to the raging sea, the barren crags, and  deserted fens,<br />
        which was why I was resting my head in the first  place,<br />
        distorting human affairs in the polemics of survival,<br />
        in the enigmas posed by the use of the words  themselves,<br />
      sustaining almost anything that floats.</font></p>

        I pick up a newspaper, and put it back down.<br />
        I pick up a tape-measure and start rolling it out,<br />
        making a mark at 31 and continuing,<br />
        until at 60 it stops altogether<br />
        and I look out at the unrecorded distance.<br />
        Then I just sit quietly for a while<br />
        in a blaze of liquid sensation. Skiing is not  allowed,&nbsp;<br />
        nor is hunting or fishing,<br />
        just gliding along a low cliff for a while, then out  above the deep.<br />
        I am basically a moderate person and often tire of  myself,<br />
        my drunken attempts to sum up existence in an  evening,<br />
        like poetry in that one makes impossible demands of  it,<br />
        or one can be found differently,<br />
        smashed on the sidewalk in a trance, face down,<br />

        until expanded into something more exciting<br />
        for the entertainment of the great, and politically  well-placed,<br />
        as well as for those who feel that they sink through  a sieve<br />
        and who seek an explanation for this.<br />
        In our American English is the expression &quot;left  field.&quot;<br />
        It is the largest of the three fields,<br />
        and the one Americans most often come from,<br />
        walking with limps toward the setting sun.<br />
        Really only about one-third of the news they hear<br />
        can be considered &quot;bad&quot;; and of that<br />
        an even smaller percentage which could be called  truly disastrous,<br />
        or &quot;catastrophic,&quot; in the classic sense;<br />
        but when one brings up the subject of poetry,<br />
        discharging it among minor globules of conversation,<br />
        they shiver up the length of their spines.<br />
        They know that millions have died horribly from  excessive reading,<br />
        useless quotations trickling from parched and  swollen throats,<br />
        closing glassy eyes directed in vain&nbsp;<br />
        to a final mirage of feeble verse<br />
        overwhelmed by relief columns of practical  industriousness,<br />
        an assault even on the poetic dreams of my great  predecessors,<br />
        Generals Grant and Washington,<br />
        who fell and died with a splash in the poetic lake  of their country,<br />
      which is no worse than having noodles for brains, or  ice cream.</font></p>

        I fall in a heap sometimes,<br />
        on your doorstep in a bundle,<br />
        spilling out in any number of ways;<br />
        and missing many opportunities,<br />
        some of which do not yet really exist;<br />
        as visitors over two miles away, on Maple Avenue,<br />
        a street over two miles away,<br />
        and during the journey the moods are sharply  transitional,<br />
        almost a parody of Shakespeare as one scene relieves  another,<br />
        and in almost all of them are moments of crisis.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hmm. Change and growth, stagnation and decay.<br />
        With other devices I circle the rooftops.<br />
        I burst onto the scene, mature by 1848,<br />
        and settle down to the gourmandise of Victorian  inelasticity.<br />
        Below stairs, in the kitchen, there is related a  classic metaphor,<br />
        in which an iron ladle of universal night<br />
        scatters a trail of visibly glowing stars<br />
        across the artistically morbid nineteen-fifties,<br />
        determined by people molded in the Twenties,<br />
        enduring the artistic spasms of their maturity.&nbsp;<br />
        I finish reading <em>The  French Lieutenant's Woman</em>,<br />
        and wish that Charles would end up with Sarah.<br />
        That's what the Fifties were all about,<br />
        ending up with the right person,<br />
        as opposed to with God or the Apocalypse,<br />
        which would be very difficult for me to comprehend,<br />
        but very interesting.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I start off the Seventies, publish a book, and fall  back exhausted,<br />
        to languish in my personal version of the  ex-neo-Protestant ethic,<br />
        although I am not really competent to speak of it,&nbsp;<br />
        nor would it be in good taste.<br />
        For my part I just take it or leave it,<br />
        like November on the leg of the needle's quadrennial  plunge,<br />
        when political famine rages<br />
        and Wit is burned in the presence of Theory,<br />
        with a bowl of warm and bloody water as a side dish;<br />
        when the electorate acts <em>automatically</em>,<br />
        in that is has &quot;no effect&quot; on the rest of  the year;<br />
        while I shun the crowds like a person from the  Fifties<br />
        and autumn turns peacefully to winter <br />
        and your hair descends in sudden glory,<br />
        as on the soft shoulders of the daily epic,<br />
        which gets pushed roughly down at the close of day<br />
        for the crude pleasure of its simple narrative;<br />
        a train grinds to a halt, for example, a man emerges<br />
        holding a sealed and grimy box; the box is resealed,<br />
        I awaken, and the man returns by car.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the lyric as well ends up more or less prone<br />
        on the rumpled bed of narration,<br />
        summer turning peacefully to autumn, for example,&nbsp;<br />
        as a few flakes of rust float allegorically onto the  highway,<br />
        while I look out at the afternoon sun,<br />
        having arisen again from the cold June water.<br />
        On a pure whim I get up and pour out a drink, three  fingers,<br />
        and then another,<br />
        with puzzling but gratifying effects;<br />
        I visit Rome for the first time, and Greece, old  women<br />
        carrying candlesticks and not without prejudice,<br />
        who soon have you munching garlic and stale bread,<br />
        hauling their barrels up from the Mediterranean,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        getting stains on your picturesque clothing;<br />
        and suffering the insolence of the northern peoples<br />
        in their idiot perpetual renaissance,<br />
        onions falling out of a bag.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I crawl back through the sawdust to my table,<br />
        searching for a perfect phrase. I sit down<br />
        and begin the American epic;<br />
        in which gods and goddesses in the late 18th century<br />
        sprinkle the dust of adventurous enlightenment<br />
        on a passing eagle,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        who lands as if on vacation and beats the dust into  rebellion,<br />
        flecked with the vestigial droplets of Puritanism,<br />
        the vestigial mediaeval reaction<br />
        to the sensual abandon of Renaissance curiosity.<br />
        The God of War enters with a sword;<br />
        I run forward with a pen and tell him to leave.<br />
        Greatly incensed, he leaves with his attendants,<br />
        his brazen shield indelibly spotted with the ink of  truth.<br />
        So you see it is possible, from my experience,<br />
        to rout the forces of war and disruption,&nbsp;<br />
        who become like straying sheep,<br />
        and borrow a woman's skirt and bonnet<br />
        (which they sometimes forget to return)<br />
        and play some domestic comedy involving food:<br />
        bread, corn, beans, and steak,<br />
        the odds and ends of a homely American cooking<br />
        eaten by men who grumble and women who lament,<br />
        as curtains lower to the familiar smells of frying  potatoes,<br />
        onions, and rice;<br />
        a performance ending up not so much as a <em>nocturne&nbsp;</em><br />
        but a NOCturn, the first syllable getting most of it  over with,<br />
        so that with the brief appearance of the final  syllable<br />
        one can merely retire to a convenient flat rock<br />
        and watch the sun move on in its fate,<br />
        through one transparent door after another,<br />
        leaving them open for us to follow after<br />
        in the subordinate madness of a satellite.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is in that vein, then, the rich streaming blood  of comedy,<br />
        that I shoot the rapids,<br />
        the humorlessness of the turbulent times in which I  live,<br />
        and plunge over the falls<br />
        and pierce the ripe giant tomato of death,<br />
        and continue in its vast red pulp at last truly  alone.<br />
        I fall to dozing about it,<br />
        and occasionally try to write about it,<br />
        and then stop, as if for a nap.<br />
        I tried last winter in &quot;Sleep and Poetry,&quot;<br />
        at the end awakening, as if from a nap.<br />
        Then as now my life is very simple and of course  tragic,<br />
        but my thoughts are very complicated.<br />
        I had always found my thinking inexplicable<br />
        and then, on July 15, 1960, I began writing poems,<br />
        which oddly enough has made me feel gradually more  comfortable,<br />
        at least an improvement over when I was nine, in  Rego Park,<br />
        slowly ripening beside the great asphalt ladle of  Queens Boulevard<br />
        which led a broad trail of starry lights<br />
        to the distant elegance of a visible Manhattan,<br />
        which proved still to be there after many years,  August 1960,<br />

        and was the home of Sid Caesar for a while<br />
        who was good for a dollar tip on a drugstore  delivery.<br />
        People came from nowhere after the war,<br />
        like going nowhere during it.<br />
        We played in the postwar expansion as the buildings  went up,<br />
        then faced with a vanished frontier our families  pushed on,<br />
        out to the Island, to Jersey, or Connecticut;<br />
        mine trekked to the silver Alaska of Westchester,<br />
        to picturesque Dobbs Ferry on the imposing Hudson,<br />
        where you got beaten up if you were Jewish,<br />
        far from the recently victorious Israeli army,<br />
        and where the devout Irish mayor taught public high  school as well,<br />
      and was the scourge of the Protestant students.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lethargic Hudson gleamed in the sun,<br />
        symbolizing our forthcoming journey into the world,<br />
        as the nearby ruins of the Jay Gould estate were the  window<br />
        on man&rsquo;s glory and predictable fall.<br />
        By 1953, &quot;Ferry&quot; was one of those  inescapable puns.<br />
        Popular music was terrible.<br />
        Many of the people who I saw on those streets<br />
        have died in the meantime, complaining bitterly, et  cetera,<br />
        part and parcel of the last hundred years,<br />
        which like the last five have been a period of  transition,<br />
        demonstrably different at the extremes,<br />
        but with many of the same people alive for a good  deal of it,<br />
        until each dies, finally, closing the transparent  door in front of us,<br />
        and like the dawn is a symbol for progress and a new  beginning,<br />
        an elderly man, who enters for a moment to give some  sound advice.<br />
        Like Walden Terrace it is usually cement,<br />
        leading like a path from the back door to the  garage,<br />
        and then a long drive down a deserted highway<br />
        past a setting for something very real,<br />
        like Elvis Presley in 1957,<br />
        closing the door behind you in much the same way,<br />
        taking the dog out for a walk and coming back in for  dinner.</font></p>

        working hard to relax in them,<br />
        closing my eyes on the roof of the world,<br />
        rain turning to snow, removed from the company of  others,<br />
        and by the time it melts everything has changed.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More truthfully, though, on feeling the first few  drops<br />

        which is in a glare,<br />
        but more the glare of the south and its blue  treacherous coast,<br />
        not the staggering lonely white glare of the far north,<br />
        where eventually you stumble into the arms of a bear<br />
        and give up, in a dazzling flurry of blood and fur.<br />
        But there is another option, the middle way,<br />
        the temperate zone on the eastern coast,<br />
        a smoldering environment of temptation and betrayal,<br />
        immersed in the cauldron of boiling anticipations,<br />
        sitting on what appears to be an empty stage<br />
        bathed by an emblematic moon.<br />
        Furtive silhouettes enter from stage right and stage  left,<br />
        monstrous allies of dubious organization,<br />
        gliding up the aisles where you shiver with fright,<br />
        until you knock the plugs out and they stiffen with  cold.<br />
        After the harmful liquid has drained,<br />
        you stroll at random among the limp and soggy items,<br />

        ironically would search for healthy skin, grimace,  and move on.</font></p>

        or found in one of the real ones<br />
        existing platonically for years in my vision of New  York,<br />

        on which, in their version of the Middle Ages,<br />
        Europeans searched for firewood,<br />
        using the leftovers to build some ships<br />

        studying feverishly, arranging for transportation,&nbsp;<br />

        and the part that is discovered as a vehicle<br />
        for moving along the ground, nettles along for the  ride<br />
        on the corpulent coachman's tattered coat.<br />
        I sit back to enjoy the ride,<br />
        my head a veritable brimming cask, a flickering  distant campfire<br />
        in the relentless flow of night.<br />
        Its blackness can limit our activities<br />

        I stumble out in the night, turn around<br />
        and come back in the morning,<br />

        awaiting the dreaded delivery up to the typewriter,<br />

        from which I drink by definition in failing health<br />
        as much as can be held;<br />

        spreading out as far as possible into the infinite,<br />
        no more than a few miles really,<br />
        until I feel more peculiar than usual.<br />
        I break the ice and plunge into bottomless sleep.<br />
        I lie in bed and think about life<br />
        or get up and go to the store;<br />
        taking a tentative step on the soft pear of  convention<br />
        which can lead to sinking into the worst of two  worlds,<br />
        the world of fashion and the world of bitter  hallucination,<br />

        I verge on the maudlin, jump the gun, drag my ass,<br />

      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A frog croaks continually in the pond below,<br />
        and jumps out onto the ground.<br />
        I climb through a window and cross the floor<br />
        past a forest of utensils.<br />
        A heard of bison roams the great plains;<br />
        they bite my hands so I feed them;<br />
        a girl paints a yellow sun streaked with orange,<br />
        the last of some lines before the Christmas rush,<br />
        before the wingless exasperations of Bloomingdale&rsquo;s<br />
        which already entwine my heels<br />
        in intellectual pursuit.<br />
        I knew it would happen eventually,<br />
        Frank&rsquo;s poems would come out,<br />
        and I would feel the impulse to close up shop,<br />
        so I have sat down to write,<br />
        evading the personality, like Rimbaud,<br />
        jumping into one, like Marianne Moore,<br />
        or sitting simply like a sack of raisins in space &#8213;<br />
        as you threaten to become my personal Rachmaninoff.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have never been able to drink in the morning,<br />
        as opposed to Frank, to whom the day was of a piece,<br />
        the sun poised firmly in the middle of the sky,<br />
        though many a fortress has been lost in the meantime<br />
        and a snowy range of mountains rises behind them,<br />
        with some of the people forgotten,<br />
        cancelled out by pretty events.<br />
        I didn&rsquo;t meet Frank O&rsquo;Hara in 1959, as in the book&rsquo;s  notes,<br />
        we met in 1962, August, by chance in the Cedar Bar. In  1959<br />
        I hadn&rsquo;t even begun to write, and by 1962<br />
        the problem was neatly reversed,<br />
        having wept with love and irritation<br />
        beneath the honorable sky,<br />
        which leads everywhere at once.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">December 15th, noon, 1971,<br />
  one quick drink and I&rsquo;m off to Bloomingdale&rsquo;s,<br />
        crawling with ants on a Popsicle of moving clouds,<br />
        against the color of the junior sky, by extension<br />
        to Irma&rsquo;s coat, the far promontory, and the uniform of  the person<br />
        who turns the handle<br />
        in Rachel&rsquo;s Musical Mystery House, the end of Part I<br />
        the road and the morning.</font></p>
      <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m still here, 12:22, perhaps three minutes fast,<br />
        forgetting what I was going to say.<br />
        Two more drinks Towle and you&rsquo;ll say anything.<br />
        I haven&rsquo;t been called Towle since high school.<br />
        I had something else to say but I don&rsquo;t remember what  it was.<br />
        Two Spanish painters are painting my front door a  tasteless orange,<br />
        one more anonymous tribute to &ldquo;Why I Am Not a  Painter.&rdquo;<br />
        <em>Dr. Zhivago</em> is a great novel, I don&rsquo;t care what anyone says.<br />
        I could have written <em>Safe Conduct</em> myself; in l964<br />
        it occurred to me I might write one for Frank some day<br />
        if he ever died before I did, which wasn&rsquo;t likely.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well he did and I haven&rsquo;t.<br />
        Irma needs skirts<br />
        so I&rsquo;m going to Bloomingdale&rsquo;s to look for some,<br />
        empty ones that is. I remember when it could be said<br />
        that someone had a dirty mind,<br />
        no more hopeless and antiquated than having, say,<br />
        the mind of Henry James.<br />
&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s place is in the novel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; Henry James,<br />
        who would be sipping something more exotic;<br />
        but I have really got to go,<br />
        out through the door<br />
        to the facts of life.<br />
        My life at any rate is more oblique than Frank&rsquo;s.<br />
        What have I ever said to the sun, for example.<br />
        What did I ever say to Frank, for that matter,<br />
        brooding on the promontory of my early poetic  development,<br />
        silent and self-preoccupied, garrulous and  self-preoccupied,<br />
        not that anything&rsquo;s changed too much,<br />
        an aging Frank O&rsquo;Hara Award winner<br />
        jumping from ice floe to ice floe,<br />
        a step ahead of a horde of younger practitioners,<br />
        to whom I nevertheless occasionally turn and shout  some advice:<br />
        which is not to have a mistaken notion of your  biography;<br />
        no event in your life is of the slightest importance,<br />
        but there is nothing you cannot use;<br />
        the unceasing events of your boring life<br />
        occur only for the success of a particular poem<br />
        awaiting your efforts on a horizon.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For instance, it is supposed that I am drunk at a  party;<br />
        I walk unsteadily into the foyer<br />
        where Joe, Jane, and John are putting on their coats.<br />
        I stand there for a moment, breaking the alliteration,<br />
        then find my way back, staggering with the  implications,<br />
        to the hors d&rsquo;oeuvre of the infinite room<br />
        which I have chosen from the swirling elements,</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">from the actual events, stories, and people.<br />
  I don&rsquo;t see clearly the swirling elements,<br />
        I am made up of those elements;<br />
        it would be better to live <em>over</em> a dyke bar than <em>under </em>one;<br />
        like poetry they perhaps at worst only confuse two  specialties,<br />
        itself with life in poetry&rsquo;s case.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally I have gone to Bloomingdale&rsquo;s<br />
        and I am back.<br />
        You call that lyric you big bag of shit?<br />
        I am not talking to myself,<br />
        or in that manner to a great poet of the past,<br />
        that must be Frank, talking to me;<br />
        I am at last fully awake in this mortal life,<br />
        for the few years in the middle,<br />
        and I keep myself opaque and I don&rsquo;t regret it,<br />
        on the promontory.</font></p>
