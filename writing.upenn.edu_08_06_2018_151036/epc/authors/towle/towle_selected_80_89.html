  sugar &mdash; lots of sugar &mdash; beef,  pork and lamb, ground<br />
        beef, salt and other spices,  fruit from the trees,<br />
        and soon I was living, and  have kept<br />
        for what seems to be a long  time: the cup I have been drinking from<br />
        without knowing what's in it;  and glancing at the stars<br />
        one can see from over here.  The universe<br />
        looks so different tonight;  what planet am I on? One<br />
        where they charge 30 cents  for The New York Post,<br />
        and that used to charge for  the Sun, the Mirror, and the World<br />
        with its Telegram, by means  of which I was a Republican in 1948<br />
        through the cartoon dramas of  donkeys and elephants; I guess<br />
        I preferred elephants by the  time my father brought home the paper &mdash;<br />
        I still don't think very well  in the afternoon, I let<br />
        The New York Post do it for  me, leaving night's approaching footfalls<br />
        in a shoebox in a closet  somewhere,<br />
        until Apollo finishes his  stroll across the sky, in his sensible<br />
        shoes of gold, to the banana  peel of the horizon<br />
        and takes a slow pratfall  into the west. But the door is opening<br />
        so I pretend I'm working,  finishing my essay: &quot;Antwerp:<br />
        a Psychosomatic  Overview,&quot; though it is just an idea, crossing<br />
        my mind, like all the others  that left for greener pastures,<br />
        hoping they might actually  get to nibble on something, something<br />
        real, the thought of which  paralyzes me<br />
        into reading The New York  Postover again, while pools<br />
        of future impressions form on  my right, and on my left:<br />
        smoking dung from the past,  but fortunately far to my left,<br />
        the distance to the horizon  that always cuts me in two,<br />
        bringing more pictures of  impressions of pictures: Matisse, Turner,<br />
        and the World Trade Center &mdash;  from its foundation of financial bananas<br />
        taking a slow pratfall into  the Hudson,<br />
        leaving just more blue, some  pink, and garlic-purple<br />
        as a plane flies overhead  taking the half in the distance.</font></p>

        someone shit in your hat,<br />
        although I don't think you  actually brought a hat,<br />
        in fact I don't think you  even own a hat<br />
        in the history of my  impressions<br />
        that turn the wheels<br />
        to mash the colors<br />
        and correct them in their  nests of spots,<br />
        rustling the shrubbery<br />
        of indefinite iambics<br />

      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The spots disperse in their  nests<br />
        like the little adventures on  crutches<br />
        seen on crutches, you vaguely  think,<br />
        trying to sit up straight<br />
        through the interruptions<br />
        and the constant weight of  yourself<br />
        which struggles on up the  ravine like soldiers<br />
        treading expertly on the  wildflowers<br />

&quot;That is not a part of  it,&quot;<br />
        the reader may object,  glancing at the images<br />
        that fill in the cracks and  minutes<br />
        in this part of the city.<br />
        Again someone calls out,<br />
        and it is probably true,<br />
        having ventured out among the  comparisons</font></p>
      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and someone calls out once more,<br />
        in a verbal glint like a  spider's web<br />
        through a tiny square in the  screen,<br />
        though why the glint will not  move<br />
        when I move my eye<br />
        I leave to the voluptuousness  of speculation, or,</font></p>
      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">more idiosyncratically, in  the consequent<br />
        wave of mutterings, leave buried<br />
        in a thick layer of pumice,  with a topping<br />
        of olives and burnt pine  cones, or<br />
        more eccentrically still,<br />

        olive <em>leaves</em> and pieces of burnt pine <em>bark</em>;</font></p>

        couldn't drag me from this  place. Just stop it! Just<br />
        stop that kind of talk! The  music builds,<br />

        Jean's cousin is sleeping  over tonight, which I mention<br />
        because I seem to be in a  different literary tradition tonight,<br />
        sort of a &quot;Write 'til  you puke&quot; school, though that would probably<br />
        take longer than it should;  anyway, I continue: Jean is painting,<br />
        small canvases, and I am  writing, small poems, and I have both a glass<br />
        of wine and a glass of rum &mdash;  why limit yourself<br />
        if people think you're an  alcoholic, in the important<br />
        decisions? Part of an  incredibly complicated dream I had last night<br />
        was that Jean went out and  bought cough drops, an incredibly ordinary<br />
        fact, considering that she  has a cough. &quot;Camels,&quot; I say, and point out<br />
        that when Frank, Frank  O'Hara, gave up Camels for Marlboros back in '64<br />
        or was it '65 he lost most of  his cough pretty quick but of course little<br />
        good that did him; I mean it  wasn&rsquo;t what did him in. Part<br />
        of <em>Jean's</em> dream last night, or so she told me and why<br />
        should she lie about it, was  that I had invited Joe and Eunice Fearer<br />
        and Joe and Marjorie Singer  to Jean's grandmother's<br />
        house in Chicago, with whom I  don't get along, the grandmother not<br />
        the house and the city  falling somewhere in between; I guess the reason<br />
        the Singers and the Fearers  were there is that they recently bought<br />
        prints from us, though Jean  knows them hardly at all but I've<br />
        known them for years; and in  addition to this, in the dream, Jean<br />
        was introduced to someone who  turned out to be someone else, who<br />
        then sat down next to her on  the sofa and had it out, jerking off,<br />
        trying to <em>come</em> on her, and I was there too,  apparently, and was being<br />
        absurdly nonchalant about it,  which is maybe in the right direction but that<br />
        would be beyond even me; far  beyond, like these iris vinyl place mats<br />
        I'm nowhere near ordering,  though if <em>you're</em> interested, they're  four-fifty each<br />
        and 18 by 12 &mdash; inches &mdash;  metrics haven't really caught on yet, at least<br />
        with <em>my</em> particular poetic self: &quot;And kilometers and kilometers to  go<br />
        before I watch TV . . .  &quot; There are no doubt other reasons<br />
        why that one doesn't work,  but there's no point in criticizing<br />
        my own materials, since  someone else is almost sure to. At<br />
        Ted Greenwald's wedding not  too long ago I opined, or, rather,<br />
        asked rhetorically (I  thought), what would become of the New York<br />
        School of Poetry (having  noticed a number of the other guests) if<br />
        somebody blew up the building  (probably someone who hadn't been<br />
        invited) and a colleague  within earshot said, or opined, that it would<br />
        be <em>improved</em>. Now, eliminating the building as a possibility for  &quot;it,&quot; &quot;it&quot;<br />
        occurred to me that my own  work was included in this appraisal,<br />
        but on the other hand he was  also including his own, which was both<br />
        self-effacing and, at the  same time, again considering the guests,&nbsp; <br />
        more eclectic than the  implications of my original remark; but since <br />
        the building <em>didn't</em> blow up I am here thanking you  for your patience and<br />
        cooperation. I would never  let a mere <em>appraisal</em> stop me anyway  (though<br />
        a small-caliber revolver  would probably do the trick). The wine is beginning<br />
        to taste acidic, I'll stick  to the rum, while Jean is still<br />
        painting and while her  cousin, Martha by name, is presumably<br />
        asleep, and while the  television carries on with its endless entertainment<br />
        and the music indicates that  Fredric March's wife is dying.</font></p>

      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That? That&rsquo;s just a leopard  bite, taking its gnothic place<br />
        on the oscillating structure  of neophantic events<br />
        amidst the luxuriant greenery  of this corner of the world<br />
        that adds to the Salad of the  Nation, and gets tossed<br />
        with the brown historical  croutons of national earth.<br />
        Who is this meal for, I  wonder vaguely, floating away gradually,<br />
        gnothically, in circles that  have elsewhere been described as Baltic,<br />
        all the convenient materiality  having dripped down the walls,<br />
        exposing silence and age.<br />
        But let&rsquo;s leave all that for  the moment<br />
        and let it simmer in the  serrated backwaters of self-perusal,<br />
        because things have been  simply humming with activity this week<br />
        here at Watercress Gardens;  and speaking of neophancy, this<br />
        is my dog, Shabby, and my  cat, Giblet. These are the flies<br />
        hovering above the specimens,  and this<br />
        is the wind, dying down in  the bluish-white atmosphere. The rest<br />
        is indescribable, but humming  with activity all the same.</font></p>
      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet, even so, by this time I  am probably looking around<br />
        and humming to myself, a few  aimless bars of something,<br />
        and tapping a finger on my  John Keats paperweight. Maybe<br />
        I&rsquo;ll run into James Watt, I  think; I&rsquo;ve got a great joke for him &mdash;<br />
        it takes place on shale: but,  to make an endless <br />
        story shorter, Jim is a  little old to be believing in Santa Claus<br />
        so the Polish guy shoots him.  And now, though stunned<br />
        by my pointlessness, the  audience might as well stay in their seats,<br />
        for it is that edifying time  when Shabby, Giblet, and I like to enjoy<br />
        a beverage or two (and I  think Giblet is already waiting for some more)<br />
        before sinking into our  private evening humors<br />
        in which we battle potent  emotions and bizarre imaginings,<br />
        as sulfur, nitrogen, and  other fantastic substances assault our senses,<br />
        depending on whether we are  being figurative or abstract.</font></p>
      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By this time I am looking  around yet again,<br />
        and discover that I am the  only poet there,<br />
        a restless quavering of  strings in search of a composition. Apropos,<br />
        while we&rsquo;re waiting and  speaking of gnothic, have <em>you</em><br />
        ever struggled out of bed in  the morning, ready for practically nothing,<br />
        and found a greasy floor,  littered with walnuts?<br />
        That wasn&rsquo;t poetic but it  certainly wasn&rsquo;t reality,<br />
        the way pondering the cold  rose-gray mist on the water is,<br />
        or the earthquakes, war, and  pestilence<br />
        that bring about minute  changes in earthly color and form.<br />
        But when things are all  relatively back to normal<br />
        it will still be the pressure  of your lips<br />
        that will be needed to stir  in her breast the metaphorical milk,<br />
        as she waits for your words  in their colorless envelopes,<br />
        though first you have to  decide how big your people are going to be.<br />
        I tend to leave them about a  quarter of an inch high, myself,<br />
        far below in the sand,  swirling in objective solitudes.</font></p>

        the two halves of the brain  should be working together: the left,<br />
        with its nose to some  rational grindstone, and the right,<br />
        which was probably off gathering  wool somewhere. That is,<br />
        the <em>reasonable</em> letters of h, j, k, l, n, m, y, u, i, o, &amp; p<br />
        will be interacting with the  illusory, or &ldquo;off-the-wall&rdquo; letters<br />

        for example, might start out  with letters that are logical enough<br />
        and then get a bit screwy  toward the end. But do you remember<br />
        when the human race had to  write &ldquo;by hand&rdquo;? Certainly a great deal<br />
        of irrational nonsense was  dashed off by right-brained left-handed<br />
        authors (Blake and Dostoyevsky,  for two), before the typewriter<br />
        imposed the practice of  having the two brains cooperate, thus<br />
        insuring the intelligent  balance of the modern movement.</font></p>
      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be sure, whether the writer was right- or left-handed,<br />
        there was always the issue of  the unused digits in those far-off days.<br />
        They could help keep the  parchment from moving for a while,<br />
        until the inevitable boredom  would cause them to wander off,<br />
        most often to the writer&rsquo;s  lap, an unwholesome situation that released<br />
        a centuries-long torrent of  superfluous erotic imagery,<br />
        infiltrating even the  composition of religious disquisitions,<br />
        as in St. Augustine. John  Donne had the good fortune to lose an arm<br />
        in mid-career &mdash; resulting in  the abrupt elevation of his concerns;<br />
        Milton, of course, classical  as always, went literally blind from<br />
        this phenomenon: &quot;a  sinister hand in the nether land,&quot; as he tellingly<br />
        mumbled on his deathbed, and  took the precaution of having his daughters<br />
        take his dictation with both  hands at once. Thomas Aquinas<br />
        strapped the left hands of  his monkish scribes painfully behind<br />
        their backs and so forth, the  two minutes by now being up. </font></p>

        that's all for the prose.  For poetry,<br />
        the dawn comes up and I  make some more coffee,<br />
        and it awakens me to the  whispering<br />
        of yet ten <em>more</em> turbulent years,<br />
        and I drink the coffee,<br />
        and wait for someone to  believe me,<br />
        the rain not yet having  reached the ground,<br />
        and I jump toward the sun<br />
        that still reaches to this  moment,<br />
        the sun the same messenger,  Guillaume Apollinaire,<br />

        to be based on the discrete  equivocations of reorientation,<br />
        that is, before we notice  the equally arbitrary objectification<br />
        of her geographical locus,  and of course after the inevitable<br />
        reassessments in light of  her minimal directionality, vis-&agrave;-vis<br />
        the iconoclasm of her  palette, or &mdash; how shall we put it &mdash;<br />
        before the wilting leaves  of haptic justification<br />

      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">or, more accurately still,  let us say that she has heterologicized<br />
        one of those disingenuously  ontological peregrinations<br />
        along the poststructual  cliffs, which rise ominously<br />
        from the choppy  late-capitalist sea, and during which one is<br />
        buffeted by serializations  of destabilizing yet culturally specific air,<br />
        since it has been her  avowed programme to signify other stuff as well,<br />
        morphologies not found in  the high, self-reflexive strategies<br />

        in variably  undifferentiated but choreographable detritus,<br />
        piled in privatized mounds,  and swept to the microcosmal center<br />
        of her rented studio floor.  However it will be on the non-planar periphery<br />
        where we must examine the  elliptical chromatic juxtapositions,<br />
        the pigments at first  &quot;curated&quot; and then vivified<br />
        in a conscience-stricken  frenzy of post-Neo-Marxist mark-making,<br />
        gesture-ridden  obsessionality exploding in the solitude.</font></p>

      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has never been more  apparent that this other artist<br />
  here under scrutiny &mdash; we'll  just call him Jerry, to avoid<br />
  any needless obeisances to  formalism &mdash; has been encoding his ongoing<br />
        conglobulations with  brushstrokes employed neither as <em>paint</em><br />
        nor as artistical <em>behavior</em>; he treats his canvases<br />
        neither as <em>surface</em>, nor as <em>material</em>; nor does he consider<br />
        his expensive paintbrushes  either as <em>personae</em>,<br />
        or as overly elongated  sticks with various lengths and textures<br />
        of fuzz on the ends of  them; nor does he epitomize<br />
        his interactively  commodified archetypes<br />
        as privileged and  discursively non-specific <em>conversationality</em>;<br />
        nor does he regard his wife  as feminist discourse made manifest;<br />
        nor his children as  chronological counters<br />
        in yet one more economic  ploy in the Western consumerist prospectus;<br />
        nor his family snapshots as  gratuitous photographic appropriationism;<br />
        not does he consider his  long years in art school<br />
        to have been a succession  of coloristic sensations<br />
        now recontextualized in a  futurity of societal confinement<br />
        and held in abeyance with  the patriarchy&rsquo;s bourgeois hierarchical<br />
        differentiations,  picturesque though they may be. No,<br />
        our artist here under  consideration relies on none of these tropes,<br />
        synechdoches, tactical  minutiae, and the occasional zeugma,<br />
        merely in order to resubmit  them to the methodological <em>re-</em><br />
        deobjectification prevalent  in referencing the systemic ravings<br />
        of the expressionistically  besotted art-press media apparatus,<br />
        only to have them spatially  revalorized in the externalization<br />
        of postmodernism's <em>hommage</em> to its entropically  anachronistic self.</font></p>

      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So just where does the rest  of this loosely assemblaged school hang today,<br />
        that is, in relation to the  targeted subtextual positionality<br />
        of our &quot;Jerry,&quot;  or, rather, our &quot;post-Jerry,&quot; or &quot;Gerald,&quot; now that he<br />
        seems to be back  documentizing along a reconfigured formalist track?<br />
        Perhaps it is time to ask  whether, stranded as we seem to be<br />
        on the tangential  significations of our fin-de-si&egrave;cle dogleg,<br />
        it is not appropriate to  request that the too-rarely-seen Lacanian six iron<br />
        be pulled from the  materialized bag of fetishistic ambiguities,<br />
        to get us beyond the sandy  fulvous cipherings<br />
        of the non-utilitarian but  site-specific traps<br />
        and leave us resting and  expectant on the edge, i.e., the &quot;context&quot;<br />
        of the &quot;green&quot; of  the common zeitgeist. But then who<br />
        will putt us into the cup  on this par-infinity hole,<br />
        so that we may emblematize  the biomorphisms of its signature style?<br />
        Perhaps it is also time to  untie Professor L&ouml;schblott's <em>formbundles</em> [<em>sic</em>]<br />
        and privilege our newly  authorized <em>oculization</em> [<em>sic</em>]<br />
        with a range of modulated  vacancies that will be,<br />
        at least in the <em>peculiarization</em> of their  phenomenological hegemony,<br />
        less neo-conceptually  overdetermined.</font></p>

      <p class="style17"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, as this writer has  argued elsewhere &mdash; well, no, not <em>argued</em>,<br />
        exactly, merely offhandedly  suggested, perhaps, though<br />
        in a hermeneutically <em>agenda-cized</em> way, and admittedly irreal  amidst<br />
        this present writer's  academically iconicized achievements, the<br />
        artifactual simulacra one  must assess to avoid the <em>vernacularized</em><br />
        path to the idiosyncratic  monumentality that, by this time,<br />
        might just as well be <em>dis</em>constructed and laid out, in a more  or less<br />
        semiotic agglutination, in  what the neoclassicists of another day<br />
        might have archaically and  simple-mindedly called &quot;long lines,&quot;<br />
        but which here, in point of  fact, have been particularized,<br />
        one atop the other, as part  of a &quot;marginally faux-normative simulation,&quot;<br />
        if I may be permitted to  coin a phrase.<br />
        But could these  coterminally murmuring signifiers and referents<br />
        be but echoings of the  phallocratic dematerializations<br />
        that have been shorn of the  dysfunctional reifying the disenfranchised<br />
        were made to hang on the  subliminal washlines of Eurocentric society?<br />
        Or rather have such  pseudological garments been reinhabited<br />
        and made more resistant to  the ambient darts and architectonic<br />
        brambles of monochrome  solipsisms<br />
        before being rehung in the  museological closets of specificity?<br />
        It would seem as if the  mediational landscapes of catenary praxis<br />
        have been shrouded in a language-based  night, the ebonized fist that,<br />
        nonetheless, in an approach  to a distantly surrogate &ldquo;morning,&rdquo;<br />
        may unclench a bit<br />
        and show the schematicized  portrayal of its inhabitants, who turn<br />
        their male and female gazes  to the glints of impending criteria,<br />
        hints and clues that  highlight the barest opacity of a preliminary sketch,<br />
        beginning the spectation of  the world in some newly translatable way.</font></p>
