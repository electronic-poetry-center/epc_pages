      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tony Towle:</b> I think I have always had a vague feeling about  &ldquo;poetry&rdquo; as a platonic abstraction that I aspire to, as opposed to what I have  actually written (or <em>will</em> write, for  that matter). Poetry as the sudden impulse for me to write poems may have saved my life in 1960, when I  had reached a serious emotional impasse. But the need that expressed itself in writing poems quickly moved to the vexed  question of <em>what </em>and <em>how</em> to write, and eclipsed the therapeutic  aspect of it. It was not a solution to the problems of existence so much as a spellbinding  path I could never reach the end of, and so it has kept me going. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>I first came upon  your work through David Lehman and Star Black&rsquo;s </em>The KGB Bar Book of Poems<em>, and later through the Internet. What do  you think of the way the Internet has impacted how one discovers new writers? </em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> It would be difficult to gauge how many poets get &ldquo;discovered&rdquo;  through the Internet and what it can mean for them in the long run. I doubt  that even very small presses browse on-line for writers they can publish &mdash; it&rsquo;s  still a buyer&rsquo;s market. But the Internet certainly makes it much easier to find  out more about a poet one is looking up &mdash; i.e., already knew about &mdash; as perhaps  you did with me.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>Do you think the works  of poets are more readily available now than when you were starting out in the  1960s?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> Yes, definitely. In the &lsquo;60s and later, there were a few  literary bookstores one could go to and browse through the little magazine  section to see what was going on and who was new. By the &lsquo;90s there were a few  less. And that&rsquo;s in New York. I don&rsquo;t know what the situation was over this  period in Maine. The Internet has flattened that out with all the on-line  magazines (and blogs) that are available anywhere at any time; it has made  geography, not to mention the hours one keeps, irrelevant.<br />
  &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>How has your  association with the so-called &ldquo;New York School&rdquo; affected your writing </em>&mdash;<em> particularly your close association with Frank O&rsquo;Hara, Kenneth Koch, and John  Ashbery?</em> </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> And don&rsquo;t forget James Schuyler (I almost wrote &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ll  keep it formal). I would say the association was crucial, and I think my work  has been influenced by all four &mdash; but it&rsquo;s really up to others to speculate about  exactly how. It might be illuminating to quote a few lines from &ldquo;Addenda&rdquo; &mdash;  which I wrote in 1971: </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;know&nbsp;from&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;O&rsquo;Hara&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;poem&nbsp;and&nbsp;its&nbsp;setting</em><br />

      <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its&nbsp;serene&nbsp;and&nbsp;tremendous&nbsp;burden.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I discovered the work of these four poets (along with that  of many others) in Don Allen&rsquo;s seminal, and by now antique, anthology, <em>The New American Poetry 1945-1960</em>, which  I came across in a Greenwich Village bookstore in late 1961 or early &lsquo;62. I was  daunted but excited &mdash; the book seemed to open up worlds of possibilities. By  the way, I have seen a certain amount of revisionist &ldquo;discourse&rdquo; about the  Allen anthology lately, but for me, coming to poetry abruptly, without having  read very much of it, either contemporary <em>or </em>from the past, it was a revelation. On the other hand, I felt no such  excitement when I browsed through the Robert Pack-Donald Hall &ldquo;academic&rdquo; anthology, <em>New Poets of England and America</em>,  published two or three years before &mdash; to which Allen&rsquo;s book was seen by some as  an alternative. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="_ftnref1" id="_ftnref1"></a>As it happened, I saw Kenneth Koch and Frank O&rsquo;Hara read  their work on successive Sundays in a series of readings that summer of &lsquo;62 at  the New School (the first poetry readings I attended). I recognized and spoke  to Frank at the Cedar Bar a couple of weeks later; took Koch&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s  poetry workshops at the New School in the spring of &rsquo;63; met John (who was  visiting from Paris) at a party given by Frank that summer, and met Schuyler at  the party given by Kenward Elmslie that fall (or winter) to introduce him to  the young poets who seemed to have sprung up from nowhere over the previous year  or so &mdash; such as Ted Berrigan and Ron Padgett, as well as me. <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="towle_Gato_Interview.html#_ftn1">1.</a></font></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b><a name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2"></a>RG: </b>From 1964 to 1981 you  worked for Universal Limited Art Editions; you have commented that it &ldquo;added  immeasurably&rdquo; to your literary sensibility. In what ways did collaborating with  visual artists inform your own writing?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> Well, it wasn&rsquo;t collaboration <em>per se. </em><a href="towle_Gato_Interview.html#_ftn2">2.</a> that added  to my sensibility, but being around great practitioners of an art that was not my  own. Tatyana (Tanya) Grosman, who started ULAE in 1957, was Russian, and was 60  in 1964. She decided she needed a &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; and her idea of a secretary was a  European one, such as Rainer Rilke to Auguste Rodin &mdash; and she thought a young  poet would be appropriate, so she asked Frank O&rsquo;Hara, the only American poet  she knew, for suggestions &ndash; and thus ended up with me. The position was much  more than secretarial &mdash; I did just about everything at one time or another  except actually print (lithography printing is an art in itself) &mdash; this  included driving the artists, gallery people, collectors, and museum curators the  40 miles from New York to West Islip, Long Island, where the studio was located,  showing the prints, making packages, writing the bills, etc., etc. I was usually  present with Tanya when an artist signed, numbered, and titled a new lithograph  (etchings were added to ULAE&rsquo;s repertoire in 1967) and I embossed the  publisher&rsquo;s seal on every print. So I became intimately familiar with the art  over the years, as I came to know the artists. I would say it was by a process  of osmosis that my time at ULAE affected me, and I can&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly how it  got into my poems; but it did.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>Did writing for </em>Arts<em> and</em> Art in America<em> contribute to your sense of style as a poet?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> The short answer is no. I wrote reviews for <em>Art in America</em> from 1979 to 1989, and by  1979 (at 40) my poetic style had been long established. With <em>Arts</em>, I was the copy editor from 1988  until 1992; some of the denser &ldquo;artspeak&rdquo; I had to deal with inspired a satiric  poem, &ldquo;Rhapsodic Reviews.&rdquo;</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>What artistic values  in the visual field did you find yourself exploring in your own work?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> I&rsquo;m not sure that I have explored any, at least consciously.  I don&rsquo;t know which &ldquo;values&rdquo; <em>can</em> be  explored to a literary end, at lease in any practical way. As we all know, a  visual work of art is apprehended simultaneously, then more fully understood over  time (I guess a sculpture is somewhat of an exception), whereas writing is  taken in sequentially, word by word, and then is understood further by repeated  readings. It has been said that O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s &ldquo;Second Avenue&rdquo; was a literary equivalent  of Abstract Expressionism, but I&rsquo;ve never been convinced that its effect was  anywhere near the same esthetic experience as looking at a Pollock or a de  Kooning. There are of course types of &ldquo;visual poetry&rdquo; &mdash; of which I have managed  but one example (&ldquo;new york&nbsp; 7/29/72&rdquo;),  which appears in <em>Autobiography and Other  Poems</em>, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it was an exploration.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&nbsp;</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>Much of your work has  an ironic and humorous tone, coupled with surreal imagery or speech. How did  you hit upon this style and how has your style evolved over the years? Is it a tone you  deliberately work toward?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> No, it&rsquo;s nothing I consciously worked toward. Ironic and  humorous is what I have always been, or rather, at some point, maybe at about  11 or 12, started becoming. So it was a tone too ingrained not to creep into my  work, and is probably becoming more pronounced as I age. Irony is for the  powerless. The rich and authoritative might use sarcasm, but not irony. They  want to be understood &mdash; irony is ambiguous. I&rsquo;ve always been skeptical of  authority, and irony has a subversive aspect. That might have something to do  with it. As far as humor, it is a necessary part of life. I think an utter lack  of wit in a poet is a sign of a vastly inflated self-importance (as opposed to  my moderately inflated variety).</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for the surreal, it&rsquo;s always seemed like a natural resource  for me. I never doubted its artistic validity. Surrealism had already sifted  down into the movies by the &lsquo;40s, and American urban life was arguably surreal  in itself before I was even born. I was affected by the surrealist paintings at  the Museum of Modern Art when I first saw them as a teenager. Also, my sense of  reality has always been a little unreal and my dreams had always interested me &mdash;  not as character analysis or portent but as another reality. Reality and  unreality, the factual and the fictive, are all on the same level on the page  anyway, and I see no reason to stick to so-called objective reality, or  autobiographical truth, for that matter. I&rsquo;m not interested in illustrating,  highlighting, or even heightening reality, but in transforming it.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>What do you make of  the debate of form and content being played out between Language poets and New  Formalist poets? What kind of legacy do you think this will leave to poets just  getting their start?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> Well, this is a debate in which I am not at all involved,  and in the results of which I have no stake. While I am friendly with several  well-known Language poets on a social level, what I take to be their general  &ldquo;project&rdquo; has nothing much to offer me &mdash; it&rsquo;s too fragmented, too cerebral. I  think it may have wonderful subtleties for the initiated, but I don&rsquo;t have the  patience for them. What has annoyed many is the presentation of this disjunctive  style as <em>prescriptive</em>, the way  Clement Greenberg prescribed &ldquo;all over&rdquo; abstraction in the &lsquo;60s as being the  true and only way for painters. (By the way, Greenberg painted conventional,  figurative watercolors in his spare time, which I have always found odd.) </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As to the New Formalists, I&rsquo;m as interested in their work as  they are in mine. They are the inheritors to the poetry in the Hall-Pack  anthology mentioned above, and that wasn&rsquo;t to my taste either. As for legacy, I  would hope that poets just getting started would have the presence of mind to  sidestep this kind of absolutism &mdash; which is not to say that they shouldn&rsquo;t read  the work of individual poets in these groups, at least to see what the fuss is  about. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>RG: </b>What advice would you  offer to aspiring poets?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> Well, as indicated above, I would advocate independence of  spirit. They should follow where their sensibilities lead, picking and choosing  from both the present and past what is of use for their own work. They will  inevitably become associated with other poets, but should be wary of the kind  factionalism mentioned in your previous question &mdash; unless they find that kind  of activity (manifestos, diatribes, etc.) entertaining. I wish every aspiring  poet the best of luck, but I have to point out that, for many, poetry turns out  to be a phase. Poetry can be a difficult row to hoe to say the least, from the  point of view of fame and fortune, so to persist one needs to be strongly  impelled from within. </font></p>
