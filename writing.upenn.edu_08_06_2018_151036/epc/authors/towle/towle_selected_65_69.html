      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The magic month of June, when I was born.<br />
        Ducklings take their first swim in a nearby pond,<br />
        roses and strawberries grow wild;<br />
        the summer begins to vibrate<br />
        with portents of riot and jailbreak.<br />
        By October the parks and fields are full of fog,<br />
        as though there were clouds on the ground,<br />
        instead of in the sky. In October<br />
        there is a lot of smoke. One goes up with it<br />
        to the noonday sun, or disappears with it<br />
        into the late afternoon.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things are established by July. The floors of the  houses<br />
        are spread with rushes; our machines have worked  themselves<br />
        to exhausted perfection. But I am not thinking about  that;<br />
        I am thinking that we roll across the sky like the  planets;<br />
        the sun shines on us as on them; ants and beetles<br />
        go quietly along the ground, and every day we sleep.</font></p>
      <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He is pried loose, but soon he is back, clinging to  the bed.<br />
        First is the mother; then there are friends<br />
        and a number of women. The roads and highways are  lined with<br />
        flowers; there are hundreds of hotels and castles.  Spring,<br />
        in the castles, is a brilliant burst of color and  gaiety; one<br />
        is hardly aware of the surrounding rhythm of life. We  only know<br />
        that on the following day there will be the same  delightful<br />
      things to do and that nothing will ever change.</font></p>

      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The snow covers all the earth, falling faster and  faster.<br />
        We think sadly of the trees and the sunshine, the  clouds<br />
        and the flowers. We go peacefully to sleep,<br />
        first one side toward the sun, then the other.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sun rolls down the sky in the afternoon<br />
        and drops into the sea with a restful hiss.<br />
        The woods are calm and safe. A flurry of snow <br />
        comes in the daytime, while we are walking.</font></p>

      <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An engineer pushes a button in the mountains,<br />
        and another mountain lifts itself<br />
        and slides into the lake,<br />
        revealing a patchwork of interesting minerals.<br />
        The air follows us as we walk along.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look at all this junk. My glass is cracked suddenly.<br />
        Look at the punch leaking out onto my sleeve.<br />
        That is the way I see things,<br />
        that, or locked up in storage bins, alongside one  another<br />
        and hanging from my tie as from a dangling rope,<br />
        ending up in the same intrigue of thoughts,<br />
        becoming a digestible poison,<br />
        and the nerve-endings evolved to cope with danger<br />
        do not know what to tell the brain, so they think  about it.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back in the mountains. The engineer pulls a switch,<br />
        and a mountain,<br />
        making a quiet, sliding sound, lifts itself<br />
        and slides into the lake.<br />
        There is bound to be a breeze now,<br />
        we are a hundred feet in the air.<br />
        There is no shock, just a quick vibrant lift.<br />
        The air comes with us,<br />
        a warm halo of fog and icy water with no sense of  motion.</font></p>

      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We eat and hear as your kiss descends<br />
        over the piano and the sky.<br />
        The tide rushes out of a box and I am dead.<br />
        Prokofiev is dead, as I am.<br />
        On the day of judgment, when we are released,<br />
        we will hear the rain and the thunder<br />
        and miles of cars will stop in their tracks.<br />
        The line down the highway is white,<br />
        the color of the sky before Prokofiev.<br />
        At the beginning I am here behind the typewriter.<br />
        I wander off to the cliffs to see the sharks<br />
        looking for a finger or some bloody popcorn or a  ruined doll.<br />
        I throw them a ruined doll.<br />
        The camera moves in for a close-up. I adjust my tie<br />
        but it focuses on my cigarettes, Pall Mall Filters,<br />
        and the shining gold pack that contains them.<br />
        The camera goes on across the crowd.<br />
        We have five seconds on camera, a daguerreotype,<br />
        the room is upside down and objects fall with a crash.<br />
        Then a picture of an airplane.<br />
        The airplane or the sun is upside down.<br />
        It is the sun, which falls like an egg onto a plateau.<br />
        The real sun burns it to a disgusting omelet.<br />
        The sun also drains the color from the words; the moon<br />
        turns them to chalk and they collapse.</font></p>

        and breathe the air, on a coast,<br />
        arriving at the coast out of breath<br />
        and helpless, distressed about your conclusions</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> because it is evening and difficult to see,<br />
        then everything you sense may be enchanted, in a  fugitive way,<br />

        The smile, of the daughter, warms the dead snow.<br />
        They are in the basement. They are on the roof,<br />
        a function of the shadowy street;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;but you, divine perceiving light,<br />
holding one&rsquo;s foot as we soak up the rays of the sun<br />
        over an icy ocean of winter at sea, bring us our  voices<br />
        as they would be in the movies, hoarse from the  dialogue,<br />
        our dripping hands full of tobacco, our frozen eyes<br />
        folklore already captured by a review<br />
        in a comparison with the vivid past,<br />
        our development racing the comparison, an impression<br />
        racing the drug.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You, comprehensible light, may find us leaving<br />
        and present us as you wish. We understand the  problems,<br />
        the highlights and shadows &mdash;<br />
        but the drug takes effect and we are doctors,<br />
        fumbling to open our eyes and hands; we think<br />
        the scalpel is something else. We say goodbye,<br />
        yelping and banging the door.<br />
        Circumstances fall into place and the pulse slows to  normal.<br />
        He examines a liver and eats it. The shape of the  liver<br />
        is repeated until he is depressed, the light revealing  nothing else.</font></p>

      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You open your eyes, the gentlemen disperse,<br />
        each to a situation<br />
        you will investigate when you are rested,<br />
        with mixed feelings and time for contemplation,<br />
        and things falling, in slow motion from the window,  into place,<br />
        as falling from the highest place imagined<br />
        in the coming moment, has produced the effect of  falling now,<br />
        and shows what is an orange falling from its place,<br />
        with later others, in disorder, also falling,<br />
        and the orange has fallen, into the water,<br />
        and we are free to see it disappear,<br />
        and unencumbered we go to the nearest place that is  comfortable.</font></p>

      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea stops, halts, abruptly.<br />
        A friend may enter the room, happy and alive,<br />
        talking, and you listen but you are not sure.<br />
        You stand and listen.<br />
        We will feel better with the conversation tomorrow,<br />
        understanding it differently and admiringly,<br />
        the words growing dense and great. When their  greatness diffuses<br />
        we notice the colors of paint. Their delicate use  astounds us,<br />
        the silver hue at the top remaining that color<br />
        as we wade, intoxicated with the warmth of the water,<br />
        the group of figures at the front, the bottom,  conveying<br />
        the infinite satisfaction their presence makes  possible,<br />
        delighting us with the colorless air they breathe,<br />
        stirring the breathtaking length of our trip like a  fluid.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the morning we are set in rows and given problems.  Who<br />
        finishes quickly is given one more, more complicated,<br />
        until finally things are perfected and we disperse, as<br />
        gentlemen, having started with nothing and excelled in  everything,<br />
        our projects and accomplishments nearby in the light,<br />
        illuminating our successive details.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a thought. The light is excluded from the  trees<br />
        and the group of people are fools, departing, leaving<br />
        a woman, naked and pensive, near a cloud, and<br />
        watching it from the distant side of a space<br />
        covered with inches of water. She turns her head,<br />

      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I begin to feel passion.<br />
        I walk back and forth and it is a slow movie,<br />
        without the interest of acting, only walking.<br />
        Far from my prying eyes she strips off her clothes.<br />

        I began to gasp. It is time to sing the death song,<br />
        clearing the tops of the trees, hearing the glass<br />
        from the window and the traffic from the street.<br />
        Each year is a supermarket; no, each year is captured  by a word,<br />
        repeated with nostalgia, overwhelmed by ineptitude,<br />
        dropping to the ground and rolling down the bowling  alley of the sky.</font></p>

        already from an afternoon<br />
        limp and limpid in the shoals of repose<br />
        of bemusing crowds and currents with which to subject  myself<br />
        direct and imagining<br />
        toward yet a 21st refreshment of the  Christian era.<br />
        I disappear into the reaches of what I think I am  doing,<br />
        stretched on its mossy banks in diaphanous oblivion<br />
        away from the mountainous stellar structures<br />
        which confine the newest materials<br />
        tied in aluminum weights to the furious morning brain,<br />
        as bellowing anarchy beats its skull<br />
        on the quaking cement of the city<br />
        and roots and herbs wait beneath for a crack; personae<br />
        watch from the fire escape and look once more at the  sky,<br />
        subjected to the peculiarities of their drowsy creator<br />
        who has fled from the previous day<br />
        as a man waves to a train from a train,<br />
        protected from the exertion of stopping;</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I arrive with the years of my sleep<br />
        past the age of Keats&rsquo;s conclusion,<br />
        radiant with nervousness and Hyperion&rsquo;s weight,<br />
        refusing forever the wishfulness of the visual,<br />
        and suddenly consumed by a great sadness<br />
        as precious autobiographical moments are wasted<br />
        and the blood pumped into the anguished perception<br />
        brings the anticipation of night and the closing door.  There is,<br />
        as I remember, a resistance to the silence of the bed,<br />
        to the lilacs and privet<br />
        which will presently bloom at the corners of the wool,<br />
        suspending the animal activity in the room,<br />
        until released to an interesting and serious province<br />
        with a random similarity to the sublime.<br />
        Planes go by in the dark.<br />
        Figures emerge from the closet<br />
        and I withdraw to allusion or awake in horror<br />
        to skim the oxygen from the air,<br />
        an element of which I am composed<br />
        and is common to everyone, like a suitcase.<br />
        I try in vain to ignore the successes of the visual,<br />
        I who know so many excellent painters,<br />
        except that at night with my work the door is a  blinding crack<br />
        and for seconds I am close to a rich and starless  destination.</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The daily search for the lyric concludes the night<br />
        and painterly haystacks dot the distant imperial blue  of awakening;<br />
        or one can remember that life can be terrible,<br />
        shaving with incompetence in the diminutive maturity  of morning.<br />
        But I am alive and awake and see things clearly with a  glance.<br />
        There is no door because it is not in the picture<br />
        but there are numerous windows in the clouds of life<br />
        and there is the liquid of my contemplating brain;<br />
        it thanks you for my contemporary adventure,<br />
        when I look off with inspiration and forget who I am;<br />
        our incongruities are passed on to our children,<br />
        a line of sorrowful trees awaits them in their books</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">but the voiceless sublime will accept my invitation at  last</font></p>
      <p class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">its excess, its assistance<br />
        which the milling public<br />
        nor you nor any discovering person<br />
