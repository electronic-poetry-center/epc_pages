      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tony Towle:</b> The  immediate impetus was that Jack Kimball was starting a publishing venture (Faux  Press) two years ago and he asked me to be in his first series. All my poetry,  past and recent, was spoken for as Bob Hershon&rsquo;s Hanging Loose Press was going  to be coming out with a comprehensive New &amp; Selected (<em>The History of the Invitation</em>) about the same time. However, what I  thought I could do would be to give him some prose. I envisioned four or five  ten- or twenty-page vignettes from over the years that I had always wanted to  write about.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of them was  my experience at the New York Writer&rsquo;s Conference, held at Wagner College in  July of 1963, which took place soon after the conclusion of the poetry  workshops I took at the New School that spring with Kenneth Koch and Frank  O&rsquo;Hara. It also coincided with an intense love affair I had that summer. The logical  starting point was when I overheard Frank O'Hara on an extension phone giving  me an unofficial recommendation to the Conference&rsquo;s director. But I realized  that I really then had to go back and tell how I met Frank O&rsquo;Hara, which was  the year before. However, in between, I had taken a rather quixotic trip to Los  Angeles, where I bought books by Koch and O&rsquo;Hara in preparation for Koch&rsquo;s  workshop, which I wanted to come back to New York to take that January. This  process of what <em>had</em> to be included  led me inexorably back to the end of my first marriage in 1960, when I first  started writing poetry. On the other chronological end, I decided, a bit more  arbitrarily, to stop in December of 1963, when the my literary and social die  was cast, as it were. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this ended  up taking over from the other little pieces I was contemplating and it extended  to a hundred pages. It&rsquo;s the longest thing I&rsquo;ve ever written and it was driving  me a little crazy by the time I finished. I tried not to take liberties with  the past but to be as exact as I could and put down only what I could remember.  However, because these three years were the beginning of my poetic career,&nbsp; there was a great deal that had been seared  into my mind, though there were also events and names I just couldn&rsquo;t quite  recall no matter how much I ransacked my brain. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It took me from  May 2000 to September 2001 to finish it. (I wanted a note to that&nbsp; effect in the book, so it would be known  that it hadn&rsquo;t been written from material from 20, 30, or 40 years before.)  Jack Kimball had to stay on my case with a deadline or it would certainly have  taken longer.&nbsp; Fortuitously, I sent the  manuscript off to him via e-mail on the afternoon of September 10th,  and then Diane and I went blithely off to a party, staying out quite late. We  live eleven blocks up from the World Trade Center. A month or so later, when it  came time to read the galleys, I decided to make the note in the book more  specific: May 13, 2000 to September 10, 2001. I didn&rsquo;t want the reader to think  that I was worrying about what I did 40 years ago when the city was falling  down around my ears!</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>LE: </b>Has the architecture of New York City  influenced the spatiality of your poems?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> New York  (Manhattan) has certainly affected my poetry, and it&rsquo;s ongoing! And although I  take an interest in architecture, past and present, and am always looking at  buildings wherever I am, I don&rsquo;t think I can answer this question. I&rsquo;ve lived <em>in</em> Manhattan since 1961 and the  environment and its architecture is so much a part of my sensibility that I  can&rsquo;t really separate it. I&rsquo;m sure if I had lived on the coast of Maine all my  life, say, my poems would certainly be different! It may be worth mentioning  that a poem I wrote in the mid-&lsquo;70s, &ldquo;Works on Paper,&rdquo; in which the architectural  theme seems partly about Renaissance Italy and partly irreal, is of course  subtextually about Manhattan as well (and there is one line in the poem that  refers to this). I should also say that, although I lived in Manhattan for the  first two years of my life, as well as the last 41, I grew up (from ages two to  thirteen) on the sixth floor of a modest six-story brick building on Queens  Boulevard &mdash; but it had a million dollar view: the Manhattan skyline. I could  and did see it every day (including, at times, spectacular sunsets behind it).  So it was like seeing the Emerald City from afar rather than living in it. That  kind of perspective pops up in my poems, I think.&nbsp; Also, in 1968, I had the occasion to read Ada Louise Huxtable&rsquo;s  little book, <em>Classical New York</em>,  which gave me an overview on dating the 19th-century buildings I saw  around me every day (I was living in SoHo&rsquo;s cast-iron area by then). </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&nbsp;</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>LE: </b>You describe sharing an apartment  with Joe Brainard and his experimentation with collage. Would you see the humor  in your poems as relating to his work? </em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> Well, it was  actually my apartment, 441 East 9th Street, that Frank Lima and I  had taken over from Frank O&rsquo;Hara and Joe LeSueur in April of 1963. When Frank  Lima moved out to get married that fall, I had the place to myself and rather  liked it that way. The second bedroom was my storage room. It was Ted Berrigan  who prevailed on me to let his friend, &ldquo;an artist living in Boston right now, a  real nice guy,&rdquo; move in. No, Joe had nothing to do with my sense of humor, per  se; that was fixed long before, and I think my dark ironies are different from  the spirit of Joe&rsquo;s work. However, he was very responsible for my &ldquo;pop collage&rdquo;  period because, although his collages didn&rsquo;t affect my <em>work</em> (although I certainly liked them a lot), some of the materials  for them that he scavenged and brought into the apartment did. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Literary  appropriation was very much in the air around this time. One was given  permission to tap non-literary outside sources by both the New York School  (some of the poems in Ashbery&rsquo;s <em>The  Tennis Court Oath</em>, for example, which had come out the previous year), and  the French Surrealists. I had been toying with collage in the fall of &rsquo;63, and  had written one poem that was basically taken from advertising, and another  that primarily came from a Hindi grammar book &mdash; the diction of the translated  phrases struck me as wonderfully absurd. But Joe started bringing home  periodicals I would never have gone out and bought &mdash; comic books, &ldquo;true  romance&rdquo; magazines, wrestling magazines &mdash; which would now be sitting in piles  around our kitchen. Joe had moved in in December; in March, I started using  Joe&rsquo;s &ldquo;literary&rdquo; scavenges in earnest. I was lifting and collaging sentences  and sections from all sorts of popular publications and juxtaposing them for  effect. I felt no compunction to be &ldquo;pure&rdquo; about my borrowings, though. I would  tinker with them, changing a word here and there if I thought there was a need  for it, especially the pronouns, although the primary effects came, I think,  from the juxtapositions.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyway, this  style sort of took me over from early spring &rsquo;64 to the summer of &rsquo;65, when I  finally finished &ldquo;Lines for the New Year,&rdquo; a 600-plus-line poem I had been  working on for a year, and which was my farewell to this way of writing. (Joe  had moved out at the end of &rsquo;64, but I had long ceased to depend on just what  he brought into the house, I found my own sources.) Interestingly, I did not  immediately realize that my collage poems were very much the literary equivalent  of what Warhol and Lichtenstein and Rosenquist were doing at the same time.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&nbsp;</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>LE:</b> Was Frank  O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s &ldquo;Personism: A Manifesto&rdquo; influential on the development of your work?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT: </b>The short  answer is no. That is, certainly not when I first read it, back in 1961, in Don  Allen&rsquo;s <em>The New American Poetry 1945-1960 </em>&nbsp;&mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t have <em>known</em> how to be influenced by it; I  wasn&rsquo;t accomplished enough! From late 1962 on, Frank&rsquo;s poetry had an influence  on me but &ldquo;Personism&rdquo; itself, Frank&rsquo;s soi-disant &ldquo;manifesto,&rdquo; which I have read  many times over the years, initially baffled me somewhat &mdash;  especially the rather outrageous: <em>As for  measure and other technical apparatus, that&rsquo;s just common sense: if you&rsquo;re  going to buy a pair of pants you want them to be tight enough so everyone will  want to go to bed with you. There&rsquo;s nothing metaphysical about it</em>. I read  &ldquo;Personism&rdquo; yet once more just now, and it strikes me that perhaps the real  essence of the &ldquo;message&rdquo; is in the very first phrase: <em>Everything is in the poems . . .</em> In other words, the rest of the  text is extraneous! What is truly remarkable is that here is a statement on  poetics that is not an exposition or discussion but an <em>exemplification</em> of the poet&rsquo;s sensibility as it appears in his  poems. The well-known fact that Frank didn&rsquo;t take this assignment seriously,  that he just sat down one day and knocked it out because Allen asked him to  write a statement for the anthology, is part and parcel of the exemplification. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basically, by  the time I felt I knew what &ldquo;Personism&rdquo; was talking about, I was already  following my own path, and getting inspiration directly from Frank&rsquo;s poetry,  among other sources. However, I would like to think that some of my work  eventually achieved the <em>effect</em> of  what &ldquo;Personism&rdquo; was about (perhaps in &ldquo;Nearing Christmas&rdquo; or &ldquo;Autobiography&rdquo;  among others) and I think it can be said that I often &ldquo;go on my nerve&rdquo; &mdash;  but our sensibilities are basically different. I&rsquo;m not as willing to wing it  and then accept the results, as Frank was. I have to look at my work after it&rsquo;s  sat for a while and then, more often than not, revise it. I think I&rsquo;m more  conscious of <em>constructing</em> a poem,  even if I don&rsquo;t know where the materials are coming from.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><b>LE: </b>How have your  poems changed since the &lsquo;60s?</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TT:</b> I think I  have to talk about the very profound changes in my work that took place <em>in</em> the &lsquo;60s. First was the &ldquo;juvenilia&rdquo; I  wrote (in my early twenties!) between 1960 and the end of &lsquo;62, which I  characterized as &ldquo;jejune little ironies&rdquo; in a poem from a couple of years ago.  As soon as I began Kenneth Koch&rsquo;s and Frank O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s workshops at the New  School in January of &lsquo;63, I quickly realized that none of those poems were any  good and that I had to begin again. A few months later, it became clear to me  that the earliest <em>presentable </em>poem  was the first one I wrote in Kenneth&rsquo;s workshop, for a &ldquo;dream&rdquo; assignment that  February (called &ldquo;Sequence&rdquo;). This has remained true ever since.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then I moved  into the &ldquo;pop collage&rdquo; style as described above. By the summer of &rsquo;65, I came  to feel that I had gone as far as I could go with it. In a year and a half,  this method of working had gone from being a way of broadening my landscape and  stepping into unexpected personas, to sidestepping myself, avoiding the deeper  water, as it were. It was time to go back out on it, or into it. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frank O&rsquo;Hara, in  an interview he gave in the fall [October] of 1965 for an English magazine [<em>Studio</em>], said (in answer to the question  of what the young poets that he knew were doing) that my style was a  combination of Wallace Stevens through Andy Warhol and that it was an &ldquo;interesting  and alarming style to get to know.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know he had said this until the  interview was reprinted posthumously somewhere about five years after his death  (and I was extremely moved when I saw it). At any rate, Frank was talking about  the collage style I had already moved on from. At the end of the year, I sent  him the half dozen poems I had written that fall. </font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think he liked  them but I don&rsquo;t remember whether I ever found out for sure. In July, Frank was  hit fatally by a beach buggy at night on Fire Island, at the age of 40. I had a  delayed but lingering reaction. I had felt somehow that Frank was immortal,  regardless of how much he drank. At the turn of 1967, I wrote &ldquo;Sunrise: Ode to  Frank O&rsquo;Hara,&rdquo; a formal but personal elegy, more personal than I was used to  being, and it seemed to usher in an easier, more fluent tone in the poems that  came after it. At the time, it crossed my mind that this more conversational  and fuller style was somehow <em>due </em>to  Frank&rsquo;s death, and that in a sense I was <em>profiting</em> from it. (I had forgotten about these thoughts for a long time.) I think Frank  would have told me that it was both insecurity and self-dramatizing bullshit on  my part, that I should take responsibility for the poems I had written and not  blame them on <em>him</em>!</font></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From then on,  it&rsquo;s difficult for me to distinguish between actual <em>changes</em> <em>in style</em> from the  poems that rescued me from moments of literary crisis (which at times could be  quite prolonged). &ldquo;The Morgan Library&rdquo; did this at the beginning of 1970,  &ldquo;Nearing Christmas&rdquo; at the end of 1971, &ldquo;Social Poem&rdquo; in 1978, &ldquo;Recapitulation&rdquo;  in 1982, and &ldquo;Downtown Song&rdquo; in 1992. In fact, I can&rsquo;t be sure that there have  been any <em>fundamental</em> changes in my  work since the mid-&lsquo;70s, or I may just be too close to see what they are. On  occasion I may still lift a phrase or two from popular sources. When a brochure  for videotapes not too long ago presented me with the proposal: <em>Relive the Terrors of World War II</em>, I  found appropriation irresistible. </font></p>
