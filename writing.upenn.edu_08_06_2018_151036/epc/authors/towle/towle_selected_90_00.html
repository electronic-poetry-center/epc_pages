        as a clown. And as if that weren&rsquo;t tawdry enough<br />
        she began to look for her fading personality in  the local <br />

        the computer ramble on by itself for awhile,<br />

        and my caption,<br />
        <em>Embark on a reign of  blood and splendor; send no money now</em>,<br />

        while our topographical heroines<br />

        Herring (Bleecker) and Asylum (West Fourth)  Streets,<br />
        until it was torn down in 1865,<br />
        and the estate could easily have been seen in  1743<br />
        by the Reverend Peter Nicholas Somers, my  ancestor <br />
        <em>auf</em> Hamburg, on his way up  the North River<br />
        to assist the Palatines of Schoharie in  selecting,<br />
        from the pre-Fenimore-Cooperized trails,<br />
        the path of Lutheran righteousness.<br />
        Back in the city, Warren was compounding his  successes<br />
        by marrying Susannah De Lancey,<br />
        although <em>that</em> street&rsquo;s first name is Jim, not Susan,<br />

        Superman&rsquo;s first appearance,<br />
        in Mental Health Month of 1938, a mere <br />
        12 months before my own,<br />
        is now worth a hundred thousand dollars, I read  somewhere.<br />
        So I conceive a stroll up Staple Street,<br />

        below the Bridge of Inscrutability north of Jay,<br />
        to the Mercantile Exchange,<br />

        would seem to have exploded<br />
        but left everything a pale mental-health gray,<br />
        while the crucial insights go bouncing off,  football-like,<br />

  John Gruen and Jane &#8212; Wilson, that is,<br />
        Morris Golde, and a  number of others<br />
        who were already highly  visible on the scene<br />
        when I appeared in the  background, as a young poet, thirty<br />
        years ago this spring.  &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; <br />
        is the question I kept  hearing<br />
        from the members of this  senior contingent<br />
        as I milled about in the  clinical orchards of sociability.<br />
        How am I? Feeling old, I  wanted to say,<br />
        as a birthday approached  from the end of the week,<br />
        but these people had ten  to fifteen years on me <em>then</em>,<br />
        and of course, as is the  mathematical way, still did;<br />
        and on the other hand  there were these clumps <br />
        of stylish young men<br />
        who weren&rsquo;t even born  when Frank died. Which <br />
        was more depressing?  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a push,&rdquo;<br />
        as a bookie would say, <br />
        from his bit part in <em>Guys and Dolls</em>.<br />
        And Frank&rsquo;s sister  Maureen was there, of course;<br />
        I don&rsquo;t remember if I  ever told her <br />
        that my first &ldquo;serious&rdquo;  girlfriend, in the third grade, <br />
        was an Irish girl named  Maureen, but I guess <br />
        I&rsquo;m telling her now,  after a fashion, and this way <br />
        everybody else gets to  listen in and be bored, too.<br />
        And I guess I could have  told Brad Gooch<br />
        that in World War II all  destroyers were called &ldquo;tin cans,&rdquo;<br />
        not just the type Frank  served on,<br />
        and the battleship <em>Missouri</em> was called &ldquo;The Mighty Mo,&rdquo; <br />
        not &ldquo;The Old Mo,&rdquo; but I  suppose I&rsquo;m <br />
        telling him now, et  cetera.<br />
        It&rsquo;s the first  fatiguingly humid day in June,<br />
        that&rsquo;s partly why I feel  neglected and out of it,<br />
        no longer involved with  the art and poetry world<br />
        that still buzzes with  participants in Philip Taaffe&rsquo;s<br />
        huge and strangely  refined space. On the terrace,<br />
        I notice the motif of  pairs of human-headed winged bulls<br />
        that face each other in  banded strips <br />
        on the office building  next door.<br />
        The Assyrian Building, I  think, an opportunity<br />
        for Julius Knipl, Real  Estate Photographer, <br />
        although he&rsquo;s as  fictional as I feel uncomfortably real. <br />
        I wonder what kind of  business<br />
        is transacted in there,  I continue on to myself,<br />
        since I don&rsquo;t feel like  talking to anyone else. &ldquo;<em>Listen</em>,<br />
        Frank  cuts in, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s all this <i>Assyrian</i> baloney? Winged bulls?<br />
        Winged bull-you-know-<em>what</em>! And how can anybody <br />
        possibly feel <em>too</em> real? Why don&rsquo;t you trim the fat<br />
        off your no-moss mind  and try to be at least as entertaining <br />
        as you used to <em>think</em> you were? God knows,<br />
        <em>I</em> certainly wouldn&rsquo;t miss that kind of opportunity.&rdquo;<br />
        That&rsquo;s not fair, I  answer, your just showing up right now<br />
        would be entertainment  enough for this assemblage,<br />
        you wouldn&rsquo;t have to say  a word.<br />
&ldquo;Well, I could take  their minds off <em>that</em> pretty quick<br />
        by showing an interest  in <em>their</em> existence. The best way<br />
        to keep from feeling  sorry for yourself is to be interested<br />
        in someone else; <em>you</em> know that. <em>I</em> certainly still know that,<br />
        in  fact it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m doing at this very moment.&rdquo;<br />
        Yes, of course you&rsquo;re  right; I&rsquo;m just not in the mood.<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be truculent, you&rsquo;re  not young enough anymore &#8212; <br />
in fact you&rsquo;re thirteen  years <em>older</em> than I am now, so act it.  There&rsquo;s<br />
John Ashbery, go over  and say Hello. It&rsquo;s thirty years later<br />
and I&rsquo;m <em>still</em> getting you invited to parties,  but this<br />
        is the <em>last time</em>. You&rsquo;re on your own for the  rest of this saga, baby,<br />

        to a city, flying past the frozen clouds slowly  enough <br />
        in fact so that I could examine their very  motionlessness, which <br />
        included, I slowly discerned, a colossal  stretched-out <br />
        male figure, the same color as the clouds, his  arm wearily held out, <br />
        fully extended, the hand taking a fistful of  cloud and <br />
        squeezing it in a futile gesture as we passed, <br />
        she not noticing, <br />

        sound of a cloud as it was crushed in the giant  hand like powdery <br />
        snow &#8212; but now the plane  accelerated and left the figure behind, <br />
        and we sped between a narrow row of skyscrapers  heading <br />
        straight toward a line of others directly ahead.  We can&rsquo;t <br />
        make this turn, I thought, recognizing the  events as a dream <br />
        and turning to tell my present girlfriend about  the realness of it, <br />
        as I saw that she too was fabricated, and when I  turned toward <br />

        whole century for a mere  99 years, an entire millennium <br />
        for nine  ninety-nine;&nbsp; we get two <em>fins de si&egrave;cle </em>and two<em> fins </em><br />

        something thrown in, an  extra party &mdash; since we know we <br />
        will get to do it all  over again next year, the <em>real</em> first  year <br />
        of the 21st Century &mdash;  except that, a year from today, we can <br />

        by degrees away until my  textual orders calmed<br />
        themselves, since no one  could follow them anyway<br />
        except to their  respective diminutions and deaths, <br />
        the indistinct potential  that managed always<br />
        to be dropped from the  day&rsquo;s itinerary.&rdquo; Look,<br />
        I wasn&rsquo;t even supposed  to be here this morning,<br />
        but perspective must  begin somewhere, even<br />
        if yet another fade-in  on a foreshortened North Atlantic,<br />
        the vibrant aviatrix  herself a function <br />
        only of the  conversational ephemera <br />

        to thus become recognizable in details <br />
        that would have provided  no foothold at all, really,<br />
        other than what is on  the paper over there,<br />
        a furtive monument to  travel in the form of memoranda.</font></p>

        more were happening, a  panoply of colorful fluids <br />

        our calcified plates  were at last taken away and one <br />
        crossed the provisional  bridge <br />

        but there were now so  many interlocutors inhabiting<br />
        the erratic daylight  whir that it was no longer funny,<br />
