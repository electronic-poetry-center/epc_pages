        forty years ago, in the  Figaro <br />
        in the Village<br />
        at Bleecker and  MacDougal, exhilarated <br />
        by loneliness, poverty,  and paralyzing <br />
        indecision, resolutely  ignoring the fact <br />
        that everyone cool in  there <br />
        knew that I wasn&rsquo;t &mdash; <br />
        lost to what was <em>happening</em><br />
        behind the overpriced  coffee, 35 cents <br />
        for the fuel <br />
        to infiltrate oblivion;</font></p>
      <p class="style21"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and I waited for a  girlfriend<br />
        and  composed jejune little ironies<br />
        that I hoped would pass  for poems, <br />
        and I had all the time  in the world. </font></p>

        <em>real</em> New York poets went <br />
        and drank real drinks, <br />
        but the San Remo is gone<br />
        with everything else  from 1960 &mdash; <br />
        discarded, lost, or  broken, or certainly <br />
        wouldn&rsquo;t fit anymore, <br />

        <em>You should really think about a career.</em> <br />
        I&rsquo;m thinking about it  now<br />
        and there it is:  involuntary barbs,<br />

        and in fact it&rsquo;s cool to <em>have</em> a girlfriend at my age<br />
        I think amusedly to  myself <br />
        behind the overpriced  coffee,<br />
        2.95 to contemplate the  traffic<br />
        fleeing down the avenue  and into the past<br />

        I overheard an older man  saying lasciviously to a young one<br />
        at  the Cedar Bar a very long time ago <br />
        in clear, textbook  French and I was startled, <br />
        apprehensive for a  second that it had been directed at me,<br />
        though I have never been  to Geneva &mdash; <br />
        and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s  what Calvin had in mind <br />
        when <em>he</em> went to Geneva; he went to create an  ethos,<br />
        through which as a distant  subtextual consequence <br />
        I find myself engaged in  marginally necessary yardwork<br />
        somewhere between  Olivebridge and Krumville<br />
        to justify midnight  sensuality later on, <br />
        in the waters of the  enchanted spring<br />
        with <em>Dian</em>, the woodland nymph <br />
        who conveyed me here  from the metropolis<br />
        by means of a spirited  white Toyota.<br />
        But work for reward is  not what Calvin meant either, <br />
        really, yet it is out of  his control, isn&rsquo;t it, <br />
        for that&rsquo;s what happens  to an ethos: it dapples the landscape <br />
        like invisible confetti  from a distant century, <br />
        falling unobserved as  one rakes the leaves,<br />

      paid the sum of seven cents for  a performance billed as a charity benefit for &ldquo;The Children&rsquo;s<br /> 
      Home,&rdquo; which did  not exist. The performance consisted of the hunchbacked organizer of the<br /> 
      event  attempting to imitate a porpoise by making strange sounds. The irate children  hurled the<br /> 
      potatoes they had brought to donate to the Home at the performer,  seriously injuring him. One<br /> 
      boy swung from the chandelier, which came crashing  down to the floor. Others smashed the<br />

        by two gangsters, who  wordlessly &ldquo;suggest&rdquo; that he use<br />
        their cleaning product.  Intimidated, he switches. <br />
        Interestingly, the  thugs&rsquo; merchandise seems to be quite effective<br /> 
        although it is not clear how  much it will cost. Probably <br />
        quite a bit, because it  seems that &ldquo;protection&rdquo; is included: <br />
        When a bulldog trots up  to the car&rsquo;s rear wheel and lifts a leg <br />
        to pee on a tire the man  has just washed, the mobsters <br />
        reach into their jackets  as if to draw pistols and &ldquo;blow away&rdquo; <br />
        the offending animal.  Sensing the danger, the dog <br />
        ambles off to relieve  himself in safety somewhere else, <br />
        leaving the men in one  of those overly complex scenarios <br />
        he has noticed humans so  often become involved in.</font></p>

        the  door of the dryer to retrieve it but someone walks  by and carelessly hits <br />
        the  door, knocking the snowman into the drum. Then an archetypal &ldquo;hot <br />
        young  woman,&rdquo; in tank top and shorts, oblivious that the machine is<br />
&nbsp;&ldquo;occupied,&rdquo; opens the door, proceeds to throw  in her own clothes, starts the <br />
dryer,  and sits down to wait. One can see through the  machine&rsquo;s window <br />
that  the intense heat has melted the snow from the snowman&rsquo;s bones and that <br />
his  skeleton and the lumps of coal that compose his face are all that&rsquo;s left <br />
as  he spins entangled with the woman&rsquo;s clothes. He manages to get out <br />
        of  the dryer, however, just as she is raising a bottled potion to her lips. He <br />
        snatches  the bottle away and drinks the contents down himself. The <br />
        miraculous  coldness of the liquid causes the snowy &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; to reappear on <br />
        his  bones. But something is causing him discomfort. He reaches into <br />
        the  packed snow of his thoracic sphere and pulls out a purple brassiere, <br />
        belonging  to the young woman. He hands it to her. The fact that an article <br />
        of  her lingerie has spent time inside this creature seems to make the woman <br />
        kittenish  and sexually receptive and she gazes at the snowman with <br />
        unmistakable  passion. The latter, now that he is back to normal, gives her <br />
        a  wicked and seductive smile. But he knows perfectly well that a relationship <br />
        would  be doomed while the woman is in a &ldquo;warm&rdquo; state of being. He turns <br />
        and  waddles out the door, ruing the fact that he needlessly drank the entire <br />
        bottle  of snow-making fluid, when, if he had just let the woman drink <br />
        <em>some</em> of it, they could have  had a wild and frosty affair.</font></p>

        spreads across the  enchanted vale<br />
        tinged with <em>burnished  kipper</em> at the edges<br />
        and where shadows in <em>sudden decanted burgundy</em><br />
        have discreetly  spattered the succeeding layout<br />
        as if intent on  enhancing the already moistened village<br />
        ingeniously highlighted  in <em>transient blue deep</em><br />
        and dabbed with <em>impecunious  thatch</em>, in addition to<br />
        quasi-melodious laments  from the vernacular, as the villagers<br />
        present each other with  little pieces of their respective minds.<br />
        But of course we don&rsquo;t  really want to know these people<br />
        and since socializing is  networking to no purpose<br />
        we abandon the tableau  and look up<br />

        to see that an  eighty-ton locomotive can float on air, <br />

        and observe an insecure  lobster expiring from self-doubt<br />

        Very well, I shall pick  my way through the fundamentals<br />

        Krakatoa grew up with  two magmas,<br />
        which created feelings  of stress, conflict, and volatility <br />
        and it resulted in a  predictable eruptive displacement <br />
        that preempted the  attention of all in the neighborhood &mdash;<br />
        and thus they were  treated to monumental trauma<br />
        as acted out with rock  and gas,<br />
        supported admirably by  lava and all the ash you could ask for.<br />
        Now, let us return to  the unfinished landscape:<br />
