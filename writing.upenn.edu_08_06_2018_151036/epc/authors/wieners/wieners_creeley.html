      The poetry of John Wieners has an exceptionally  human beauty &#8211; as if there ever were any other. There is in it such a commonness  of phrase and term, such a substantial fact of a daily life transformed by the  articulateness of his feelings and the intensity of the inexorable world that  is forever out there waiting for any one of us. Charles Olson spoke of it as  &quot;a poetry of affect,&quot; by which I took him to mean a poetry that is in  the process of a life being lived, literally, as Keats' was, or Hart Crane's,  or Olson's own. In other words, the art becomes the complex act of &quot;making  real&quot; all that one is given to live, and whatever in them may be style or  fashion, the poems are so otherwise committed, so intensely a gesture of  primary need and recognition, that their survival becomes the singular value,  and their immense beauty.</p>
      <p align="justify"> In the brutal outrage of the  late 1950's, when one could pick up a Government bulletin on the home  manufacture of a bomb shelter at the post office, Mr. Wieners' painful survival  in words became our own: &quot;At last. I come to the last defense.&quot; There  was nothing else to shelter or protect him. Time and again during the 60's one  wondered, worried, whether he could make it. How specious such simply  charitable impulse looks in retrospect. He was there, he <em>stayed </em>there &ndash; as Charles Olson once  said, &quot;he's <em>elemental.&quot; </em> His writing of this time is various, often  magnificent, ringing curious changes on Augustan patterns. But whatever one  would hope so to qualify becomes unequivocally clear in &quot;The Acts of  Youth,&quot; that great poem of life's implacable realities and the will  committed to suffer them.</p>
      <p align="justify"> If poetry might be taken as  a distance, some space from the action, relief from the crowd, or if its  discretions, what it managed to leave out, avoid, get rid of, were its virtue,  then all these poems would be in one way or another suspect. They are far  closer to a purported Chinese apothegm I read years ago and continue to muse  on: &quot;How is it far if you think it?&quot; I don't truly know. It doesn't  seem to be far at all. Nor do these poems, any of them, seem ever some place  else, or where they move apart from an agent, either feeling or thinking.  They're here, as we are &ndash; certainly a hopeful convention in all respects, but  where else to meet?</p>
      <p align="justify"> The present collection is, then, an intense respect  of this fact, and the range of its materials &ndash; three decades of poetry and prose &ndash; 
      makes manifest the complex  place from which all John Wieners' work finally has come, and to which it, as  he also, insistently returns: &quot;my city, Boston. . .&quot; He said once to  an interviewer, &quot;I am a Boston poet,&quot; and there is no one for whom  that city, or any other, has proved so determining and generative an  experience. The changing faces of its presence and persons become articulate  here in this dear man's immaculate art. Against the casual waste of our usual  lives, his has proved a cost and commitment so remarkable. He has given  everything to our common world.</p>
      <p align="justify"> We read together years ago at the 92nd Street Y in New York, with its  great velvet curtain, raised stage. John remembered hearing Auden read there  and was moved that now we would. He was thrilled that one might so follow, and  so we did. But now, in these times so bitterly without human presence, risk,  care, response, he becomes the consummate artist of our common voice, and his  battered, singular presence our own.</p>
