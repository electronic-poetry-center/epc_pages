<font size=+3>Gregory Corso, 1930-2001</font><br>
<font size=+2>by Robert Creeley</font><p>

Gregory Corso died last night (January 17), happily in his sleep in
Minnesota. He had been ill for much of the past year but had recovered
from time to time, saying that he'd got to the classic river but lacked
the coin for Charon to carry him over. So he just dipped his toes in the
water. 
<p>
In this time his daughter Sherry, a nurse, had been a godsend to him,
securing him, steadying the ambiance, just minding the store with great
love and clarity. He thought she should get Nurse of the Year recognition
at the very least. 
<p>
There's no simple generalization to make of Gregory's life or poetry.
There are all too many ways to displace the extraordinary presence and
authority he was fact of. Last time we talked, he made the useful point
that only a poet could say he or she was a poet -- only they knew. Whereas
a philosopher, for instance, needed some other to say that that was what
he or she was -- un(e) philosophe! -- poets themselves had to recognize
and initiate their own condition. 
<p>
There are several quick websites that help recall him now. One gives a
brief biography and discussion of a few of his poems:

Another, more usefully affectionate, is taken from Ed Sanders' The
Woodstock Journal. It was Lawrence Ferlinghetti who had suggested last
summer that a spate of respects might help cheer Gregory in his illness --
and that they were certainly well merited:

A third, which includes some previously noted, is The Museum of American
Poetics. There's a 'streamable' video available there of Gregory reading
at Naropa , if you can get the sound clearly:

Lots of us propose to be poets but who finally stakes all, or just takes
all, as being that way? In my life time only Robert Duncan could be his
equal in this way. It was honor indeed to have had his company.

<font size=+1>The Whole Mess ... Almost </font>
<br><br>
I ran up six flights of stairs <br>
to my small furnished room <br>
opened the window <br>
and began throwing out <br>
those things most important in life <br>
<br>
First to go, Truth, squealing like a fink: <br>
"Don't! I'll tell awful things about you!" <br>
"Oh yeah? Well, I've nothing to hide ... OUT!" <br> 
Then went God, glowering & whimpering in amazement: <br>
"It's not my fault! I'm not the cause of it all!" "OUT!" <br>
Then Love, cooing bribes: "You'll never know impotency! <br>
All the girls on Vogue covers, all yours!" <br>
I pushed her fat ass out and screamed: <br>
"You always end up a bummer!" <br>
I picked up Faith Hope Charity <br>
all three clinging together: <br>
"Without us you'll surely die!" <br>
"With you I'm going nuts! Goodbye!" <br> 
<br>
Then Beauty ... ah, Beauty -- <br>
As I led her to the window <br>
I told her: "You I loved best in life <br>
... but you're a killer; Beauty kills!" <br>
Not really meaning to drop her <br>
I immediately ran downstairs <br>
getting there just in time to catch her <br>
"You saved me!" she cried <br>
I put her down and told her: "Move on." <br>
<br>
Went back up those six flights <br>
went to the money <br>
there was no money to throw out. <br>
The only thing left in the room was Death <br>
hiding beneath the kitchen sink: <br>
"I'm not real!" It cried <br>
"I'm just a rumor spread by life ..." <br>
Laughing I threw it out, kitchen sink and all <br>
and suddenly realized Humor <br>
was all that was left -- <br>
All I could do with Humor was to say: <br>
"Out the window with the window!" <br>

Just an additional note with respect to Gregory Corso's sad death: <P>


"A wake here in NYC Tuesday aft &amp; eve (January 23rd) on Bleeker Street,
directly across from the house where he was born. Italian gov't gave
permission for his ashes to be interred in the English cemetery in Rome
with Shelley." <P>
