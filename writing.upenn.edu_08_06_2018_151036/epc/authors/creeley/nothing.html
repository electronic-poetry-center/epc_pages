<title>Robert Creeley: Nothing New</title>
<font size=4>
<blockquote>


<b>Nothing New</b>
<p>
     Whatever's the case, such fact as I presumed the world to be<br>
at twenty-five or six is no longer even remotely actual.  I keep<br>
thinking of that shot in one of Fellini's movies, the one of the<br>
helicopter flying over the roofs of the city, with people<br>
variously down there, sun bathing, carrying on, waving, and all<br>
becoming smaller and smaller as the helicopter lifts up and away.<br>
That's where it was, so to speak, down there, in some other<br>
quickly fading world that even the endless horrors of the Second<br>
World War and all the trashed decades since haven't managed to<br>
put clearly in anyone's mind as what, after all, did happen.<br>
<br>
     I like, rather am caught by, that sense of history<br>
deliquescing, becoming commentary on its own agencies of<br>
recording, a schizophrenically dividing pattern of multiple --<br>
realities, all contesting, all "right" from their own demanding<br>
perspectives.  A friend spoke of the hermeneutical phase of<br>
history, that stage where it becomes the study of its own<br>
meaning.  And then the baroque, and then the post--.  Pound<br>
quoted Santyana as saying, "It doesn't matter what books they<br>
read as long as they read the same books."  The banal<br>
commonnesses we would all quickly recognize and tacitly accept,<br>
physically depleted place, diminished determinations of work,<br>
increasing despairs of any imaginable "solution," whether<br>
political or personal.  Who can think of "progress" in a<br>
terrarium, which, at best, seems what our lives "on earth" may<br>
prove to be.<br>
<br>
     Poetry, like anything else, speaks to whoever will listen,<br>
and respond in the desired manner.  Hey, man, I'm talking to you.<br>
It's a familiar pitch.  Poetry presently is probably no more<br>
"experimental" than it ever was, Wyatt shifting the beat, Chaucer<br>
getting it on in the local, or Villon using a kind of patois that<br>
was way under any imagination of street talk.  It wasn't just<br>
words, it was mind.  Like first century Rome Plautus, or<br>
Catullus really disliking certain people.<br>
<br>
     "Mine eyes have seen the glory?"  Enough to stay open,<br>
certainly, but it had little to do with qualified "great<br>
moments".  Somehow our elegantly secure cat Aphrodite having her<br>
kittens just as the first human stepped out on the first moon<br>
ever to be walked on is something I'll remember most specifically<br>
of that event, like they say.  Is it that the so-called<br>
"personal" keeps drifting back into "self," wants the home of its<br>
own habits, recognizes even in vastness its own familiar hat and<br>
coat?  I don't really know, and I is fading, intermittent<br>
signal, batteries running down.  "Oh build your ship of death,<br>
for you will need it..."  D.H. Lawrence got to me, he made sense,<br>
he made clear that feeling, touching, holding, seeing, being with<br>
other people in every sense, was the fact of life, what it was,<br>
literally.  You could think anything you wanted to or could.<br>
Still you wouldn't, and couldn't, go far.<br>
<br>
     Anyhow I don't really want any more separation from<br>
anything, even the disasters, cheap as it seems to say that, or<br>
to be so glib about what I know so meagerly.  I don't want to be<br>
a poet who writes "about" "things" or will have a "poetics" to be<br>
"affected"--which returns to the questions of that time, "What<br>
did Hiroshima mean to you poetically?"  "Did the Holocaust alter<br>
your imagination of audience?"  Everything, God in particular,<br>
gets trivial if you try to make that proposed content singular in<br>
the apparent world, the diverse plurality we flounder in without<br>
ever having a clue as to what it means, other than the "meanings"<br>
we give it: "Names we have even to clap on the wind..." (in Hart<br>
Crane's words).  Or dear Wittgenstein: "If you give it a meaning,<br>
it has a meaning."  No teacher will ever grade all those papers.<br>
<br>
     Nor will the roles be played as if they were choices, as if<br>
people wanted to be doctors and lawyers and simply became them,<br>
fulfilled those roles and played them to the hilt.  If all this<br>
is a play in Shakespeare's sense, and we thus "actors," our parts<br>
will be simply assigned.   You get this, you get that, or<br>
probably more aptly put,  this is what you get, that's what you<br>
get, and  that's  that.  No refunds.  Do it or don't do it.<br>
Nobody's watching anyhow.<br>
<br>
     So what's the point, baby?  If you were alive all those<br>
years, what would you say happened?  Did you like it, or didn't<br>
you?  Did you want ever to trade it in?  The answer is, i<br>
doesn't come in a package, you are there all through, stoned or<br>
not.  You are not an exception.  If there was a puppy playin<br>
with a ball, you'd not be confused.  Yet your own delight, just<br>
the same, seems to need reasons.  "Can you afford not to make the<br>
magical study which happiness is?"  So Olson translates Rimbaud,<br>
his last poem I believe.  Did he fade out into heaven?  I don't<br>
think so.<br>
<br>
     How best to say it.  I.e., "I am a post-communist,<br>
vegetarian, unemployed, overworked, illiterate and de-signed,<br>
spiritualized, abortioned, computed, technified, e-mailed, voice-<br>
mailed, MTV'd, virtual almost surrealed person," etc.  Etc.  I<br>
thought we passed 2000 way back there.  I must have set my watch<br>
wrong.<br>
<br>
     Are you ready for the rapture?  Remember that?  Always a<br>
pitch but at least someone's talking to you.  Smile...<br>

     Poetry will make you happy, put hair on your chest, shoes on<br>
your feet, get you out there and swinging.  "Recorders ages<br>
hence...," bro, those "happy few" of 1935 Stendhal was then<br>
talking to, all that crowd like everybody's waiting for you, to<br>
get it on, get up and go.<br>
<br>
     ...Thank you for your time; I'll look forward to hearing<br>
from you.  Please call or write with any questions or confirma-<br>
tions of submission.   And all you poets of that vast future out<br>
there, don't you ever forget to enclose a self-addressed stamped<br>
envelope.  You hear?<br>

                              Nothing new<br>
                         I wasn't going to<br>
                              do to you<br>
                           nothing new...<br>
