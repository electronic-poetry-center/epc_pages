        Penelope Creeley, widow of poet Robert Creeley, smiles with their daughter, 
        Hannah, at Thursday's memorial service.<br>
        <br>

      <p>An emotional message - part thank you, part goodbye - from the widow 
        of famed poet Robert White Creeley began a memorial celebration held in 
        his honor at the University at Buffalo Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>&quot;If I don't do this quickly, I won't be able to,&quot; said Penelope 
        H. Creeley, walking to the front of a room packed with some 200 people. 
        &quot;Dear Buffalo,&quot; she said, her voice breaking, &quot;We had great 
        times here. It was a wonderful place to bring up our children. Robert 
        loved teaching here - he loved all of you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I know Robert's rooting for us all,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>Creeley, a foremost American poet known around the world, died March 
        30 of pneumonia in Odessa, Texas, while visiting there as a writer in 
        residence. He was 78.</p>
      <p>For 37 years, the prolific and much-lauded Creeley lived in Black Rock 
        and taught and wrote at UB - until 2003, when he left Buffalo to take 
        a position at Brown University in his native New England.</p>
      <p>At the memorial event, held in UB's Poetry and Rare Books Room, many 
        who knew Creeley read from his work and offered anecdotes and recollections 
        of the man - whom they recalled as warm and generous, alive and curious, 
        and fundamentally down to earth.</p>
      <p>UB English professor Robert Daly remembered the night when Creeley unexpectedly 
        showed up at an evening class Daly was teaching - and in which Penelope 
        was a student. Penelope couldn't come, Creeley explained. Could he sit 
        in and take notes for her?</p>
      <p>&quot;For 2 hours and 40 minutes he took notes on James Fenimore Cooper's 
        &quot;Last of the Mohicans,' &quot; said Daly, amid much laughter. &quot;I 
        think this is the most compelling evidence imaginable for the depth of 
        his love for her.&quot;</p>
      <p>Art Efron, another longtime colleague of Creeley's in UB's English Department, 
        recalled running into a frustrated Creeley one day as the poet was leaving 
        a meeting on campus. Efron offered him a book. &quot;He kissed me on the 
        neck,&quot; said Efron. &quot;It was a wonderful moment.&quot;</p>
      <p>Graduate students spoke of being inspired by Creeley - of choosing to 
        come to UB because he was there, of talking with him, of keeping in touch 
        with him over the years through e-mail.</p>
      <p>&quot;What a connector and a bridger he was,&quot; said Jonathan Skinner, 
        who studied under Creeley.</p>
      <p>For Morgan Claxton, who met Creeley while attending Nichols School with 
        Creeley's children, Hannah and Will, the event was a chance to pay tribute 
        to a kind man who always took an interest in the thoughts and poems of 
        a young writer.</p>
      <p>&quot;He was not only a great poet, but a good man,&quot; said Claxton, 
        a Middleport resident. &quot;Mr. Creeley was a good friend and my hero. 
        I think he would have appreciated today very much. He would want us to 
        go on and keep reading - keep learning.&quot;</p>
