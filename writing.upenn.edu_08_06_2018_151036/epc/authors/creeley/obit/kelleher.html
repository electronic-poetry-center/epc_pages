      <p><b>Michael Kelleher</b><br>
        <i>Artvoice</i> (Buffalo), April 7, 2005</p>
      <p>This past week, America lost one of the best minds of a generation in 
        poet Robert Creeley, whose work helped carry the American tradition rooted 
        in New England poets like Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry 
        David Thoreau into the modern era. A member of that group of poets which 
        came of age during WWII - including Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, Gary 
        Snyder, Denise Levertov, John Ashbery, &amp; Amiri Baraka - Robert Creeley 
        exerted a nearly unparalleled influence on contemporary poetry for half 
        a century. </p>
      <p>Robert White Creeley was born in 1926 in Arlington, MA. As a young child, 
        he lost an eye in an accident. At the age of four he lost his father, 
        a local physician. Later, he attended Harvard University, which he left 
        for a year to work as an ambulance driver for the American field service 
        in Burma and India. He returned to Harvard after the war, but returned 
        a changed man. Shattered by the senseless violence he witnessed and driven 
        by an ambition to make his mark on American writing, he married, dropped 
        out, and embarked on a career that would change poetry forever.</p>
      <p>Three key relationships, maintained mostly through correspondence, formed 
        the basis for Creeley's early development as a poet. Ezra Pound and William 
        Carlos Williams, the former serving time for treason at St. Elizabeth's, 
        the latter working as a family physician in Patterson, NJ, were important 
        correspondents and supporters of the young poet, while Creeley's correspondence 
        with Charles Olson is one of the most significant and enduring in 20th 
        century letters.</p>
      <p>From Pound (and later Louis Zukofsky), Creeley learned music. Taking 
        Pound's idea that poetry should abandon traditional metrical patterns 
        and develop a closer relation to musical form, Creeley wrote toward music, 
        specifically toward the improvised rhythms of jazz. As he writes in his 
        1987 essay, &quot;Form&quot;:</p>
      <p>So it isn't writing like jazz, trying to be some curious social edge 
        of that imagined permission. It's a time one's keeping, which could be 
        the variations of hopscotch, or clapping, or just traffic's blurred racket. 
        It was what you could do with what you got, or words to that effect.</p>
      <p>Each poem, with its broken lines, stuttered syllables, short breaths, 
        and often disruptive commas, has the feel of a verbal improvisation moving 
        headlong in an unknown and therefore dangerous direction.</p>
      <p>From Williams, he took to heart the statement that &quot;A poem is a 
        small (or large) machine made of words.&quot; The idea that a poem was 
        a &quot;made&quot; thing rather than simply the transcription of a divine 
        inspiration was (and in many ways still is) revolutionary. Equally important, 
        Williams was the most inventive poet of his generation in terms of the 
        free verse line, and Creeley's precise and at times jarring use of line 
        breaks owe much to him.</p>
      <p>It was at the suggestion of Williams that another poet, Charles Olson, 
        made contact with Creeley in 1950. These two men, whose poetry couldn't 
        be more different, became the measure of one another over the next twenty 
        years. Olson, expansive in every way, wrote the epic, The Maximus Poems, 
        which is three inches thick in book form and covers several million years 
        of history. Creeley's poems, on the other hand, are short, tightly written, 
        almost ashamed to go on too long - though anyone who ever spoke to the 
        man knows they could have - and stay focused on the personal, the subjective, 
        the familiar.</p>
      <p>Despite these differences in approach, the two shared a determination 
        to move American poetry away from its entropic combination of European 
        formalism and repressed Puritan sexuality. Each in his way sought a poetry 
        rooted in the body. Creeley's famous statement that &quot;form is never 
        more than an extension of content&quot; made its way directly into Olson's 
        manifesto, &quot;Projective Verse,&quot; which outlined a new stance toward 
        poetry and reality. For both men, a poetry of the body meant an emphasis 
        on process, action, breath, and desire. </p>
      <p>In the late forties and early fifties, Creeley and his first wife, Ann 
        Mckinnon, lived in New Hampshire, where they briefly tried their hand 
        at farming, then in France, where they made the acquaintance of poet Denise 
        Levertov, and finally in Mallorca, where Creeley began publishing Divers 
        Press. In 1954, while his first marriage was falling apart, he took up 
        a position at Black Mountain College, at the behest of Olson, who was 
        then rector of the school. There he edited the Black Mountain Review, 
        which published many of the most important poets of his generation, including 
        Robert Duncan, Hilda Morley, Ed Dorn, Larry Eigner and John Wieners.</p>
      <p>Leaving Black Mountain in 1956, Creeley lived and taught in many places 
        over the next decade, including San Francisco, where he met many of the 
        beats - among them Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg - New Mexico, and Guatemala. 
        During this time he also married a second time, to Bobbie Louise Hawkins. 
      </p>
      <p>For Love: Poems 1950-60 was published in 1962. Taut expressions of intimacy, 
        rage and despair, the poems in For Love are by turns existential, lyrical, 
        ecstatic, funny, abstract and conversational. Many of them, especially 
        the heavily anthologized &quot;I Know a Man,&quot; &quot;After Lorca&quot; 
        and &quot;The Warning,&quot; have found their way into mainstream consciousness, 
        no mean feat in an age of poetry-deaf television.</p>
      <p>In 1966, Creeley took a job at SUNY at Buffalo after Charles Olson left 
        following the death of his wife in a car accident. Creeley would teach 
        at the university for the next 37 years, though for many years he would 
        split his time between Buffalo and Albuquerque. In the sixties and early 
        seventies he produced one important collection after another. Alongside 
        For Love, Words (1965) and Pieces (1968) stand out as two of the finest 
        collections of poetry from the second half of the 20th century. </p>
      <p>His second marriage broke up in the early seventies, but his relentless 
        poetic output continued. The decade saw the publication of A Day Book, 
        Hello, Away, Presences, Thanks, and Later, among others. In 1976, he married 
        his third wife, Penelope Highton, whom he met in New Zealand, and with 
        whom he would have two children, Will and Hannah. The Collected Poems 
        of Robert Creeley, itself two inches thick, appeared in 1982.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career, Creeley's restless nature led him to travel incessantly. 
        Until the day he died, he kept a touring schedule that would exhaust a 
        twenty-year-old, reading in Stockholm one week, Los Angeles the next, 
        performing with seemingly boundless energy. After he died, a report appeared 
        on the Buffalo Poetics listserv saying he had given a reading only recently 
        in Virginia while connected to the oxygen tank his lung condition had 
        forced upon him.</p>
      <p>Despite the constant touring, the poet's life seemed to settle somewhat 
        with his third and final marriage. Until 2003, when he rather suddenly 
        took a position at Brown University, the couple and their children lived 
        in Buffalo, where in the early nineties they purchased a converted firehouse 
        in the Black Rock neighborhood, which performed dual functions as home 
        base for the Creeleys and pilgrimage site for poets traveling through 
        the area. </p>
      <p>In his role as professor, he served as friend and mentor to at least 
        two generations of younger poets in Buffalo. One could often find Creeley 
        in local caf&eacute;s or bars or in his office at the university discussing 
        poetry with students, poets and friends a third his age, or discover him 
        at a reading of a young (or old or middle-aged) poet, sitting quietly 
        in back, enjoying the fact of being in a room full his cherished &quot;company.&quot; 
        He was equally supportive of the local small press and reading scenes, 
        generously using funds from his endowed university chair to fuel current 
        discussion of poetry and poetics.</p>
      <p>Several changes take place in Creeley's later poetry. His subtle use 
        of rhyme increases in both frequency and complexity. His famous short, 
        enjambed lines begin to lengthen. While rarely growing into something 
        resembling traditional metrical lines, they become longer, looser, less 
        fragmented. An obsession with death, both the poet's own and the deaths 
        of his generation of poets, who started dying with what must have seemed 
        an alarming regularity beginning in the 1980's, haunts the later work. 
        Much of it takes the form elegy, of lamentation.</p>
      <p>Later life also saw Creeley get some of the institutional recognition 
        he deserved. He was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts 
        and Letters in 1987. From 1989-91 he served as the New York State Poet 
        Laureate. In 1997 he won the Bollingen Prize from Yale University, a prize 
        first awarded (quite controversially) in 1948 to his mentor, Ezra Pound, 
        a fact which Creeley noted with pride upon accepting the award. The following 
        year he was awarded a Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1999, he was 
        elected chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Other Awards included 
        the Frost Medal, the Shelley Memorial Award, a National Endowment for 
        the Arts grant, a Rockefeller Foundation grant, and two fellowships from 
        the Guggenheim Foundation.</p>
      <p>For poets who knew Creeley, or read him, the accolades are the least 
        important and least interesting thing about him or his poetry. In addition 
        to his poetry and fiction, Creeley's critical essays on other writers, 
        as well as the hundreds of printed interviews published in his lifetime 
        serve as how-to guides both for thinking about poetry and for acting as 
        a poetic citizen of the world. </p>
      <p>Anyone who saw him read will recall his absolutely unique reading style 
        - long, rambling anecdotes punctuated by short, intensely emotional poems 
        and short, intensely emotional poems dissolving into long, rambling anecdotes. 
        He seemed to always be &quot;in&quot; the action and feeling of the poem 
        as he read, often pausing to make a joke or to choke back tears as he 
        read poems addressed to dead and living friends.</p>
      <p>Creeley was fond of quoting Pound's saying that &quot;only emotion endures,&quot; 
        and with his passing, one can't help but feel how enduring his work is. 
        His free verse lyrics mine human subjectivity and its concomitant violence, 
        compassion and love with an often embarrassing specificity. Reading a 
        Robert Creeley poem can be startling - at first you can't believe what 
        you've seen, but after truth's initial shock has passed, a more profound 
        appreciation of the pathos and joy of being human comes to take its place.<br>
