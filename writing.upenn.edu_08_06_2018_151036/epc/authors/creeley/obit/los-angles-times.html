      <p>Robert Creeley, a leading figure of post-modern American poetry who was 
        known for his spare, concise language and a free-form style that distilled 
        powerful emotions into verse, died March 30 at a hospital in Odessa, Texas, 
        after a brief illness. He was 78.</p>
      <p>Creeley had been struggling with a lung ailment and died of complications 
        of pneumonia, according to a spokeswoman for the State University of New 
        York at Buffalo, where he taught for 37 years.</p>
      <p>A prolific poet and critic who wrote more than 60 books over the last 
        five decades, Creeley had been a distinguished professor of English at 
        Brown University in Rhode Island since 2003. He had gone to Texas on a 
        two-month writing residency funded by the arts-based Lannan Foundation, 
        which maintains the writers retreat in Marfa, Texas, where Creeley had 
        been working.</p>
      <p>A 1999 recipient of the Bollingen Prize, poetry's top honor, Creeley 
        was an early participant in movements that helped set the stage for the 
        countercultural revolution of the 1960s. He was closely allied with writers 
        of the Beat Generation, including Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, for 
        whom he typed what may have been the first copy of the epic poem "Howl."</p>
      <p>He also was associated in the 1950s with the "Black Mountain Poets," 
        whose other notable members included Denise Levertov and Robert Duncan. 
        He emerged in the 1960s as a seminal figure in what became known as New 
        American Poetry.</p>
      <p>Creeley's death "has robbed American poetry of one of its last great 
        bohemian modernists," Dana Gioia, a poet and chairman of the National 
        Endowment of the Arts, told The Times Thursday. "At his death he was a 
        mainstream canonic figure, but he emerged and lived on the margins of 
        American poetry."</p>
      <p>Using what the Bollingen Prize judges praised as the "stubbornly plain 
        language that makes a Creeley poem instantly recognizable," he wrote frequently 
        about emotions as expansive as love and events as wrenching as aging and 
        death. His best poems often were about those closest to him -- his mother, 
        his wives, his children -- a preoccupation that caused poet and critic 
        Robert Graves to dismiss him as a "domestic poet."</p>
      <p>Creeley embraced the distinction. He assumed an intimacy with readers, 
        one that bred extreme brevity to the degree that he often used incomplete 
        sentences and his own abbreviations, such as "sd" for "said." His unorthodox 
        style was pronounced in "I Know a Man," one of his most anthologized poems, 
        which presents a complex philosophical statement as a casual conversation 
        between two men in a car:</p>
      <p>As I sd to my</p>
      <p>friend, because I am</p>
      <p>always talking,-John, I</p>
      <p>sd, which was not his</p>
      <p>name, the darkness sur-</p>
      <p>rounds us, what</p>
      <p>can we do against</p>
      <p>it, or else, shall we &amp;</p>
      <p>why not, buy a goddamn big car,</p>
      <p>drive, he sd, for</p>
      <p>christ's sake, look</p>
      <p>out where yr going.</p>
      <p>To some critics, such experimentation was a fatal flaw. "There are two 
        things to be said about Creeley's poems," critic John Simon once wrote. 
        "They are short; they are not short enough."</p>
      <p>To others, his economy of language was a virtue. "If Mr. Creeley can 
        get his point across with fewer syllables, so much the better," wrote 
        David Kirby in a 1991 review of Creeley's "Selected Poems."</p>
      <p>Creeley's central contribution was an organic notion of poetry, one that 
        insisted that "form is never more than an extension of content," a radical 
        reversal of the prevailing view in post-World War II American poetry.</p>
      <p>Instead of setting down ideas within a preordained frame or rhythmic 
        pattern, such as the iamb or trochee, Creeley agitated for freedom of 
        form. He championed the principle that form should follow or evolve out 
        of the idea.</p>
      <p>This principle resulted in "a very personable kind of poetry that . . 
        . followed the rhythm of one's own heart," said Michael Basinski, curator 
        of the poetry collection at SUNY Buffalo, who knew Creeley for 33 years 
        as his student and later as a colleague.</p>

      <p>Creeley's sensibility was formed at North Carolina's Black Mountain College, 
        where he earned a degree and taught English in the mid-1950s, a decade 
        after dropping out of Harvard. Black Mountain was a hotbed of experimental 
        artists such as John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg and Merce Cunningham. Most 
        influential on Creeley was poet Charles Olson, who collaborated with Creeley 
        on the idea that poetry should be a process unhindered by the forms favored 
        by the previous generation.</p>
      <p>"His method is more like a jazz improvisation than a classical music 
        composition. He invents as he goes along," said Charles Bernstein, a poet 
        and critic at the University of Pennsylvania and a former longtime colleague 
        in Buffalo</p>
      <p>Creeley was born in Arlington, Mass., the son of a doctor. When Creeley 
        was 2, he lost an eye in a freak accident involving flying glass. Before 
        he was 5, his father died, an event that plunged the family into poverty.</p>
      <p>Insurance money from the accident and his father's death enabled him 
        to attend Harvard, where he drank and smoke heavily and floundered academically. 
        He left in 1944 to become an ambulance driver in Spain.</p>
      <p>He went to Black Mountain College at the invitation of Olson, who was 
        the college rector and earned a bachelor's degree in 1955. He later earned 
        a masters degree at the University of New Mexico.</p>
      <p>(End optional trim)</p>
      <p>Creeley's favorite expression, according to Conte, was "Onward!" He was 
        constantly on the go, giving as many as 50 readings a year. In one of 
        his last appearances a few weeks ago in Charlottesville, Va., he delivered 
        a compelling performance despite being hooked up to an oxygen tank and 
        spoke honestly of his frailties.</p>
      <p>When he died, his wife, Penelope, and two of his eight children were 
        at his side.</p>
      <p>In his last years he often wrote of the anxieties of aging with humor, 
        bite and wistful anticipation, as in "Goodbye":</p>
      <p>The century was well along</p>
      <p>when I came in</p>
      <p>and now that it's ending,</p>
      <p>I realize it won't</p>
      <p>be long.</p>
      <p>But couldn't it all have been</p>
      <p>a little nicer,</p>
      <p>as my mother'd say. Did it</p>
      <p>have to kill everything in sight,</p>
      <p>did right always have to be so wrong?</p>
      <p>I know this body is impatient.</p>
      <p>I know I constitute only a meager voice and mind.</p>
      <p>Yet I loved, I love.</p>
      <p>I want no sentimentality.</p>
      <p>I want no more than home.</p>
