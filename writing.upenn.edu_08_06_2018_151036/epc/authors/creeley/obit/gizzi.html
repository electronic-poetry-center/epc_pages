      <p>When poet Robert Creeley died last week, of pneumonia in Odessa, Texas, 
        the news sent shock waves through the literary world, but was overshadowed 
        elsewhere -- even here in Providence, where he lived -- by the death of 
        Pope John Paul II. We asked Michael Gizzi, a longtime friend and colleague 
        of Creeley's, to tell us why it mattered. </p>

      <p>Since Robert Creeley's death last week, his friends and fans throughout 
        the world have set all systems of communication humming: newspapers, phones 
        and the Internet; people sharing his poems over drinks and coffee. Tributes 
        are being scheduled across the country and Internet sites have been mounted 
        to express the sense of loss and appreciation for this most generous of 
        poets. Novelist Rick Moody is asking fellow artists and writers to post 
        memories, tributes and thoughts about Creeley at the literary Web site 
        www.conjunctions.com , which has been dedicated specifically for this 
        purpose. It would seem, in death, that he has ignited the very essence 
        of his favorite word &quot;company.&quot; Seldom does one witness such 
        an outpouring of sympathy among artists. </p>
      <p>Many were first introduced to his concise, lyric brilliance with the 
        publication, in 1960, of Donald Allen's groundbreaking anthology The New 
        American Poetry. That same year saw the publication of Creeley's For Love, 
        one of the most influential and pivotal works of the postwar period. </p>
      <p>For love - I would </p>
      <p>split open your head and put </p>
      <p>a candle in </p>
      <p>behind the eyes. </p>
      <p>Love is dead in us </p>
      <p>if we forget </p>
      <p>the virtues of an amulet </p>
      <p>and quick surprise. </p>
      <p>I remember as a young man seeing this book in everyone's apartment. Its 
        gray covers with red lettering seemed to inhabit all sympathetic space, 
        a talisman for poets and lovers alike. Photos of Creeley from this period 
        were also particularly evocative, the handsome, dark-haired poet with 
        an eye patch -- he'd lost the use of his left eye as a child. He seemed 
        a cross between Robert Louis Stevenson and Edgar Allen Poe. </p>
      <p>I've seen more than one obituary refer to Creeley as a Beat poet. It's 
        true he was a great friend to Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and Gregory Corso; 
        and over the years Creeley prefaced many reprints of Kerouac's voluminous 
        works. They'd been friends and running mates in the '50s, lived together 
        and drank together. Bob told me that once during this period he'd been 
        locked up for disorderly behavior and called Jack to bail him out. Kerouac, 
        who didn't drive, walked five miles in the middle of the night to spring 
        Bob and deposit him back at his rooming house. &quot;You would have known 
        him,&quot; Bob said. &quot;He was a very sympathetic character.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>CREELEY WAS DEFINITELY a hipster, but he was more than that. He left 
        Harvard in 1947, shortly before graduation, moved to a farm in New Hampshire 
        to raise racing pigeons, and then, with his first wife, headed to Mallorca, 
        where he edited Divers Press and the Black Mountain Review. It was at 
        Black Mountain College in North Carolina that Creeley's influence really 
        took root. </p>
      <p>Spearheaded by the 6-foot-10-inch author of The Maximus Poems, Charles 
        Olson, Black Mountain was the spawning ground for an entire school of 
        poetics. Among those associated with this school were Paul Blackburn, 
        Robert Duncan, Larry Eigner, Denise Levertov, Ed Dorn, John Wieners and 
        Jonathan Williams. It was with this group that Creeley's work was represented 
        in Allen's The New American Poetry. </p>
      <p>Though he would have been 79 in May, Bob was never an &quot;old man.&quot; 
        He had more energy than 10 young people combined; just keeping up with 
        his comings and goings could wear one out. He closed all his correspondence 
        with the word &quot;Onward.&quot; Hardly a week passed that he wasn't 
        traveling across country or abroad. He was a mentor to every subsequent 
        generation of poets. He was eminently approachable. He wrote countless 
        letters of recommendation and championed the careers of many young writers. 
        His collaborations with artists and musicians are legion. Poet C.D. Wright 
        told me that Amazon has listed more than 170 Creeley titles. In addition 
        to his own poetry, essays, a novel and short stories, there are collaborations 
        with Alex Katz, Francesco Clemente and Susan Rothenberg, and CDs with 
        such jazz giants as the late composer and soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy. 
      </p>
      <p>CREELEY JOINED THE faculty at Brown in 2003, after 37 years at SUNY Buffalo, 
        where he directed the poetics program and helped launch the careers of 
        many of today's distinguished younger poets. Bob loved Providence; he 
        was excited about it. He said he felt as if he'd finally come home. He 
        was less than 60 miles from his hometown of West Acton, Mass., where each 
        year they celebrate Robert Creeley Day. He told me how in the '40s, after 
        his mother finished her night shift as a nurse in Cambridge, he would 
        drive the family car down to Providence to play pool and hustle a few 
        dollars so he and his buddies could have breakfast before heading home. 
      </p>
      <p>He was an inveterate talker and the most sensitive of listeners. Bob's 
        heroic talking sessions seemed the perfect foil to his concise, diamond-like 
        poetry; after all that compression, he just needed to stretch. I've never 
        known a less pretentious or more generous man, who so enjoyed the company 
        of others. </p>
      <p>I experienced some painfully personal difficulties this past winter. 
        It was Bob who stepped into the breach. We had lunch every week, made 
        excursions to the sea, had marathon discussions around his kitchen table 
        and swapped our favorite jazz CDs. He and his lovely wife, Penelope, simply 
        weren't going to allow me to ruminate in isolation. It was difficult to 
        comprehend how this hero to so many could be thus invested in my well-being. 
      </p>
      <p>I know I speak here for countless others who have been on the receiving 
        end of his singular friendship and goodwill. I can't bear to think that 
        I'll never again hear that beautifully particular New England timbre of 
        his, but there are tapes and, yes, there are memories. And the poems, 
        which will outlive all of us. </p>
