<b>Four Days in Vermont</b>
<p>
Window's tree trunk's predominant face<br>
a single eye-leveled hole where limb's torn off<br>
another larger contorts to swell growing in around<br>
imploding wound beside a clutch of thin twigs<br>
hold to one two three four five six dry twisted<br>
yellowish brown leaves flat against the other<br>
gray trees in back stick upright then the glimpse<br>
of  lighter still grayish sky behind the close<br>
welted solid large trunk with clumps of gray-green<br>
lichen seen in boxed glass squared window back<br>
of  two shaded lamps on brown chiffonier between<br>
two beds echo in mirror on far wall of small room.<br>
<pre>
     .
</pre>
<I>(for Maggie)</I><br>
<br>
Most, death left a hole<br>
a place where she'd been<br>
An emptiness stays<br>
no matter what or who<br>
No law of account not<br>
<I>There but for the</I><br>
<I>grace of God go I</I><br>
Pain simply of want<br>
last empty goodbye<br>
Put hand on her head<br>
<I>good dog, good dog</I><br>
feel her gone.<br>
<pre>
     .
</pre>

Tree adamant looks in<br>
its own skin mottled with growths<br>
its stubborn limbs<br>
stick upright parallel<br>
wanting to begin again<br>
looking for sun in the sky<br>
for a warmer wind<br>
to walk off pull up<br>
roots and move<br>
to Boston be a table<br>
a chair a house<br>
a use a final fire.<br>
<pre>
     .
</pre>
What is truth <I>firm (as a tree)</I><br>
Your faith your trust your loyalty<br>
Agrees with the facts makes<br>
world consistent plights a troth<br>
is friendly sits in the common term<br>
All down the years all seasons all sounds<br>
all persons saying things conforms confirms<br>
Contrasts with "war equals confusion" <I>(worse)</I><br>
But <I>Dichtung und Wahrheit?</I> "Wahr-" is<br>
<I>very</I> ("Verily I say unto you...")  A compact now<br>
Tree lights with the morning though <I>truth</I> be an oak<br>
This is a maple, is a <I>tree</I>, as a very truth firm.<br>
<pre>
        .
</pre>
Do I rootless shift<br>
call on the phone<br>
daughter's warm voice<br>
her mother's clear place<br>
Is there wonder here<br>
has it all gone inside<br>
myself become subject<br>
weather surrounds<br>
Do I dare go out<br>
be myself specific<br>
be as the tree<br>
seems to look in.<br>
<pre>
     .
</pre>
Breeze at the window<br>
lifts the light curtains<br>
Through the dark a light<br>
across the faint space<br>
Warmth out of season<br>
fresh wash of ground<br>
out there beyond<br>
sits here waiting<br>
For whatever time comes<br>
herein welcome<br>
Wants still<br>
truth of the matter.<br>
<pre>
     .
</pre>
Neighbor's light's still on<br>
outside above stoop<br>
Sky's patchy breaks<br>
of cloud and light<br>
Around is a valley<br>
over the hill<br>
to the wide flat river<br>
the low mountains secure<br>
Who comes here with you<br>
sits down in the room<br>
What have you left<br>
what's now to do.<br>
<pre>  
         .
</pre>
Soon going day wanders on<br>
and still tree's out there waiting<br>
patient in time like a river and<br>
truth a simple apple reddened<br>
by frost and sun is found<br>
where one had left it in time's company<br>
No one's absent in mind  None gone<br>
Tell me the <I>truth</I> I want to say<br>
Tell me all you know  Will we live<br>
or die   As if the world were apart<br>
and whatever tree seen were only here apparent<br>
Answers, live and die.  Believe.<br>
<p>
