Remember German artist
<br>
(surely &quot;conceptual&quot; or
<br>
&quot;happenings&quot;) ate himself,
<br>
cut bits from his body
<br>
on stage while audience
<br>
watched, it went well
<br>
for awhile. But then
<br>
he did something wrong
<br>
and bled to death.
<br>
<I>The art is long</I>
<br>
<I>so learn, life short.<BR>

<P>

It must be anecdotal,
<br>
sudden sights along the so-called way,
<br>
Bunting's advice that David Jones
<br>
when he first met him had moved but once
<br>
in adult life and then only
<br>
when the building burned down
<br>
to a place across the street.
<br>
They were having tea
<br>
when abruptly Jones got up,
<br>
went to an easel at the far end of the room
<br>
whereon a sheet of drawing paper
<br>
with, in his immaculate script, a &quot;t&quot;,
<br>
added an &quot;h&quot; to say,
<br>
&quot;I'll have the 'e' by Monday!&quot;
<br>
Affections flood me,
<br>
<I>love lights light in like eyes &#133;<BR>
