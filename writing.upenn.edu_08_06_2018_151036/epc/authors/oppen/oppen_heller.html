      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buddhist 
        scriptures contain a saying: "regard all sentient beings as your parents." 
        The idea, I infer, is to look at every individual and occasion in one's 
        life as an actual influence, a scene of instruction, a mentoring of sorts. 
        So it is under that rubric that I wish to write about the influence of 
        George Oppen on me and my poetry. Which means that, before I get to George, 
        I must invoke the catenary leading to him. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
        what is this catenary at the end of which a poet stands face to face with 
        another poet? What chain of <i><b>poesis</b></i>, of making and reading, 
        of possible personal encounters, leads out of the self and its linguistic 
        solipsisms towards the poem which ultimately must stand apart from its 
        author, indeed, predicates its existence on the author's metaphoric disappearance. 
        Making, on the path to a poetics, is accompanied by undoing, by the attempt 
        to resist, even as one is using them, the seductions of everything prior: 
        personal history, nostalgia, conventions and traditions, and by trying 
        to refuse what Oppen called "the trick of gracefulness," the deceptive 
        enchantments of language, of abstract formalisms, literariness or harmonious 
        forms. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        uneasiness of poetic interrelation, of "influence" (as Harold Bloom might 
        inflect the word) lies buried in the factorials of poetic learning. Every 
        transmission from 'mentor' to student abrades the self's inertial desires 
        to maintain the fiction of its own "gracefulness," of its own completeness. 
        Possibly that is why, particularly in the twentieth century, we have whole 
        ranges of poets who would prefer being mentored by an impersonal theory, 
        by the dictates of a<i> zeitgeist</i> or school, all of which appear to 
        be authorless (i.e. where authority is diffuse) and so less messy, less 
        psychically unsettling. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        this essay, I have tried to grasp hold of the emotional and intellectual 
        undercurrents of my early relationship with Oppen, to lean into that relationship 
        and the psychology of it. This then is a record of youthful but also useful 
        uneasinesses.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">**</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Truth 
        also is the pursuit of it"--this line was from George Oppen's book, <i><b>The 
        Materials</b></i>, which I found among others, in the blue footlocker 
        I had dragged across the Atlantic at the beginning of an expatriate hegira. 
        My friend Ernie, who had studied with Louis Zukofsky at Brooklyn Poly, 
        had suggested Oppen's work to me, along with that of other modernist poets, 
        William Carlos Williams, Charles Reznikoff, Olson, Duncan, Levertov, Creeley.It 
        was 1965; I had won a small poetry prize from The New School For Social 
        Research, resigned my well-paying job as the head technical writer for 
        a major corporation and taken a Yugoslav freighter from New York to Europe 
        where I planned to live for an extended time. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        that footlocker were other books, Dante, Shakespeare, some contemporary 
        poets, notes and manuscripts as well as an old Hermes portable wrapped 
        in a blanket to keep it from being damaged. I had little idea what I was 
        doing. Here, nearing thirty and on the whim of a minuscule prize, I had 
        thrown a whole career away, had become "hooked," as Oppen once put, on 
        the <i>sincerity</i> of the poem, and was truly sailing into the unknown 
        (I had never been to Europe before, and my 'research' consisted mainly 
        of reading Frommer's <i>Europe on Five Dollars A Day</i>). I was ripe, 
        split wide with vulnerabilities and longings. It was a mental condition 
        that I recognized in my own attempts at poems, in my efforts to bind disparate 
        words together, words marked sentimentally for me, that I clasped or bracketed 
        into forms the way one applies a bandage or dressing over a raw wound. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two 
        things stick out from that sea voyage as markers of my state of mind: 
        One was the sound, on the radio in the ship's salon, of the empty airwaves 
        in the middle of the Atlantic, a strange roar not unlike the roar of the 
        sea itself, non-human and terrifying. Signalled by that roaring, the vast 
        jumble of phenomena, the world, made any writing, the use, that is, of 
        the intermediaries of words, a seemingly impossible act of translation. 
        I thought about this in my bunk at night, how little words counted against 
        the strange unknowableness of the world. How everything of true depth 
        to the individual struck me as being <i>unnamed</i>, and thereby unsayable 
        even as its shadow in the form of desire swept across one. The other marker 
        of my troubled mental state--I was looking, in the romance of my discomfiture, 
        for such little poetic hints--was that every evening just as the sun was 
        setting and the stars were coming out, the first officer appeared on the 
        bridge, his figure dark against the darkening sky. I watched him, immediately 
        an embodiment of certain masteries, take the sextant from its polished 
        wooden case and "shoot" the first appearing stars and the horizon, thus 
        locating our position on the vast planes of endless water. In those rough 
        and glittering seas, it struck me that only the thin, imaginary line which 
        he constructed between the heavens and the ship anchored us in any way 
        to what was at all human. That line, construed as it was from the symbolic 
        orders of numbers and ratios, was more than mathematics; it was also part 
        of our languages of hope. My education, which had been in the sciences 
        and engineering, made me well aware of the metaphoric nature of our formulae 
        and equations, how behind them lay a search for connections and attachments 
        to the physical world, to certainties and arrestments. In that sense, 
        they resembled all other questing forms of language such as poetry or 
        literature. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even 
        as the journey across the ocean ended, disorientation hovered over me, 
        a vague fog of personal and poetic choices. It was still with me some 
        months later when I had finally settled in a small house in a small village 
        in Spain. In that house, in the bedroom that was to be my study, I took 
        the books out of the locker, placed them on a shelf, put my papers beside 
        them, set the typewriter on the cheap wooden table which my landlord had 
        given me and looked around. I was unable to begin. Instead, I found myself 
        arranging and rearranging the books, surveying the room, the whorls of 
        its plastered walls. I recall nothing so much as the deliberateness of 
        my actions, as though the precision and repetition of physical gestures, 
        of minutiae would translate my surroundings into familiarities. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        was a bed in the room, covered with a long white spread. It appeared to 
        float off the floor, and all I could think of was to lie down on it, to 
        float away like a child on a nimbus. From the small high window over the 
        table, I could hear some kind of animal thrashing in the yard next door. 
        I climbed on the table and looked out but could see nothing except a thatched 
        roof where the noise came from, above it an absurdly blue sky and the 
        Mediterranean dotted with a few fishing boats. I felt vertigo, dis-ease. 
        Those words of Rilke's, as he recorded his "mystical" experience, "the 
        Spanish landscape, the last I <i>inimitably</i> experienced" ran through 
        my mind. I felt completely thrown back on myself, which I knew was nothing, 
        merely what seemed like a silly thing, this minuscule personal history 
        immersed--this much I knew about poetry--in an art that was immense and 
        arduous. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        now understand that I was looking for handholds, for any sort of anchoring 
        as I slid into the confusion of self, of self-doubt, and was available 
        for some sort of transmission. It was then that I took down the Oppen 
        book. I probably reached for it because, although I had not really studied 
        his work, I remembered that the lines of his poetry were fairly clean, 
        unadorned, without metaphorical clutter. I didn't need to think about 
        how I was going to decode it, but, rather, to be in contact with something 
        graspable to my state of mind. I turned to the back of the book, to the 
        last poem in it, "Leviathan"--this is a habit I have always had when casually 
        browsing--and read the first line of the poem: "Truth also is the pursuit 
        of it." I read the line over and over, like a chant, feeling a raw ache 
        in my chest. What did the words mean to me? I had only the vaguest idea, 
        but also a sense of wanting to weep. I calmed myself down and began to 
        decipher my response. I took the "it" of the line as art, hunger, the 
        clarification of the very confusion I was experiencing. Later, I would 
        read that this word was, of course, one of Oppen's substantives, an order 
        of nouns like "sun" or "rock," a "taxonomy," as he referred to them, which 
        hinted or pointed at the real. In my own receptive state, the line, with 
        its functionally medial "also" bridged a chasm between a pure skepticism 
        of language induced by my uneasiness and some obdurate sense of the otherness 
        of the world. "Truth" as I saw it in the line was not some abstract category 
        of universal knowledge and fact but the more humble sense of what was 
        going on around me. In other words, the facts before me, the room, my 
        vertiginous almost nauseous falling into an abyss were also "truth." I 
        could begin where I was--indeed, was there any other place?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
        bit further down in the poem, there were these lines which vaguely reconciled 
        me to my state of mind and fueled my desire to write: </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        was looking at these lines, not only or necessarily as a poet; rather, 
        I was reading them as one might read a theological tract or guide to the 
        perplexed, as a form of wisdom. I was, in this reading, unaware of the 
        'art' of these lines, the way Oppen distributed cadence or language, or 
        used parallel structures to link the "inexplicable" with the "preponderance 
        of objects", with "talk" and "fear." There was, in the most profound sense 
        that I can imagine concerning my response, no admiration present. One 
        does not admire the spar to which one is clinging. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead, 
        a certain kind of transparency was taking place, decidedly unliterary. 
        (I did not understand then how the style of the work contributed to this 
        effect.) I sensed only that the words were entering into me, inscribing 
        themselves in a place where moments before fear was regnant. In retrospect, 
        I believe I was inoculating myself into a way of apprehending poetry, 
        not as a literary product at all. For even now, I still strip down my 
        response to a poem to the, for me, essential question of its use- or meaning-value 
        in my life. Oppen's poem had stung me, but also, like the invasive barb 
        of a possibly poisonous insect, it left me irritated and anxious rather 
        than satisfied. Later, after studying Oppen's poetry for months on end, 
        this ground bass of uncertainty (which came only with the utmost precision 
        and clarity of language) became for me the central function of the poem. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">**</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking 
        back, I also see how my Spanish experience had been very fruitful. While 
        there, I had my first poems accepted for publication and had lived something 
        of the writer's life I imagined for myself, looking every morning at a 
        white page, attempting to mark it with words in some way meaningful to 
        myself. Oppen's poetry had been the strait gate to that &quot;preponderance 
        of objects&quot; which both surrounded me and were part of my physical 
        environment, and which impinged on that lost or somewhat alienated consciousness 
        of a New York Jew loose in the stark and near mystical culture of Andalusian 
        Spain. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
        curious thing had occurred in Spain, a certain sense of intimate relationship 
        in which, through the agencies of Oppen's work, I felt allied with the 
        bleak purpled beauty of the Sierra Morenos, the slopes of which were covered 
        as though in a new vocabulary of plants and trees. Even the dramatic plunge 
        of those mountains into the Mediterranean evoked the closures of poems, 
        as though the physical escarpments of that coastline were moral landscapes, 
        teacherly perspectives of poetic being. The poetry did not so much give 
        me the sanctions of description or representation nor did it suggest a 
        mode or style. Rather, its value as statement gave me a kind of confidence 
        in the act of poetry, in a feeling of being aswarm <i>in media res</i> 
        as a philosopher might put it, in a world of poetic availabilities. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
        the same time, other ideas about poetry possessed me as well, the combined 
        avant-gardisms of my youthfulness as a latecomer to poetry, which perhaps 
        led me down a curious path in the stylistics of writing. Among the "influences" 
        (and I would now say of this period that these came at the wrong time, 
        requiring me to unlearn them in order to learn them again for myself) 
        I would cite such figures as Mallarme (particularly his <i><b>Un coup 
        de des</b></i>), the pointillist painters and, most importantly, the music 
        of Anton Webern which I listened to over and over each morning as a preliminary 
        to writing. I had found in these, I thought, the projection of the future 
        lineage of poetries, the formally disjunctive and aleatory, which I heartily 
        embraced.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        mention these influences because when, after a year and a half in Europe, 
        I returned to the States, I had in hand a considerable body of poetry, 
        of a kind which, despite my late start as a writer, had been well-received, 
        published and even anthologized. And yet, as I looked again at this work, 
        as I reread it daily, I felt no feedback from it. Rather, it struck me 
        as clever and programmed, but down deep meaningless. Possibly, I was only 
        experiencing what any poet feels about prior work--a desire to be elsewhere. 
        And yet the feeling came as no ordinary case of merely wanting to move 
        on to newer things. I suddenly and violently questioned the value of anything 
        I had written.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
        I began over again. I went back to the simplest, clearest writing that 
        I could remember, the writing which had initially led me toward the act 
        of making poems: the translations of the Japanese and Chinese poets, Williams, 
        Montale's poetry and, once again, Oppen's work. I read philosophy, history, 
        anything but that kind of writing, including much poetry, behind which 
        lay some sort of dictatorial theory of readership or composition. Now, 
        in an effort at 'purity,' I was excluding a lot, from the traditionalists 
        to the surrealists to the contemporary avant-gardes. Without being aware 
        of it, I was forswearing a large portion of the extant cultural apparatus. 
        I was now thirty years old and, strangely, as though revisiting myself, 
        feeling as I had in Spain, alone, disoriented, bereft of the poetic toolkit 
        I had built for myself. I was at sea again, on the Atlantic Ocean of the 
        <i>zeitgeist</i> which stretched before me and showed no hint of a landfall 
        for my poetic making.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        think the truth is that I was again ripe, in a state similar to that when 
        I first encountered Oppen's work. And it was in this climate, in 1967, 
        that I met Oppen the man. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
        and his wife Mary spent part of each year in New York City, in a small 
        apartment on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights. They were good friends 
        of the poet Harvey Shapiro who lived only a short distance from them and 
        at whose house at a small gathering of poets and writers I came face to 
        face with the poet whose work had crucially affected me. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
        experience of meeting him reminds me that there are situations where physiology 
        has rhetorical (hence moral) force. I am speaking of the way we are drawn 
        to certain faces in photographs, how they fascinate or move us.The self, 
        Martin Buber suggests, is not a substance but a relationship, the knowledge 
        of which comes out of an encounter. Already, as I was shaking Oppen's 
        hand and mumbling a few words to him, the lines and leathery creases of 
        his face, the slightly stiff posture, that of a workingman (which I believe 
        he had cultivated when he worked as a radical populist in the Thirties 
        and Forties) was prompting a response, some knot of emotion and language 
        seeking a form. Not that I was moved to comment on his appearance but 
        that that appearance was a conditioning aspect of what I might later say. 
        Oppen's presence, and my heightened experience of his work were a kind 
        of witness to the expression I sought, not then, but in the work I wanted 
        to write. Buber's 'law' of intersubjectivity, as you can see, was already 
        at play. I cannot remember the pleasantry which I uttered on that occasion, 
        but I do sense that as I looked across the space between us, there was 
        a shift in the way words were being created. There was something ceremonial 
        about the occasion, much as if I'd been introduced to and then mesmerized 
        by a wizened old medicine man in the jungles of the Amazon. As I reflect 
        now, the encounter demonstrated to me Oppen's sense of what he meant by 
        calling himself a "realist" poet, someone concerned with a fact outside 
        of himself which he did not entirely create. Oppen, in that moment, had 
        been the "fact" for me. Ultimately, such a concern became a central part 
        of my own poetics. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        the time the Oppens spent that year in New York, I had much contact with 
        them, eating dinner at their small apartment on Henry Street, taking long 
        walks with George around the streets of Brooklyn or meeting them at readings 
        and lectures. Soon after, however, George and Mary went back to California, 
        and I carried on my conversations with him through the mail. My correspondence 
        with George was unlike any I've had with another writer. It was not merely 
        the case that I was finding my way as a poet, for I had blundered into 
        writing poetry the way I have blundered into many things in my life. Rather, 
        the letters between us were pitched at a strange, existential level. I 
        was trying to articulate to him my estrangement and feeling of lostness, 
        my sense of disillusionment with the activity of writing which filled 
        every day with a blank anguish. And so these exchanges with George were 
        not about specific poems or the business of poetry but about what poetry 
        and life had to do with each other. George's response to these outpourings 
        of mine were always kind, never dismissive but thoughtful and patient. 
        The words from him seemed to go to the ground I was seeking:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        believe to this day that I stand under the shadow of these words, that 
        they both harbor me and cast me in a darkness from which I seek to be 
        free. Reading them, word by word, it was as though they were building 
        in me not only an outlook on poetry writing but also a conscience, a code 
        which was simultaneously liberating and confining. It was almost, as in 
        Plato's parable of the cave, that I was seeing the world, certainly the 
        world of making art, through the webbings of these phrases. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        remember, as an example of this simultaneous effect, how together, we 
        worried the word "dogma," its meaning and use in our correspondence. For 
        Oppen, the word had enormous philosophical and ethical weight. He meant 
        it in some unspecified and hence all-encompassing way, not so much a terminological 
        marker as a weight, a burden, which by that peculiar operation of the 
        mind (and by the relationship I had established with Oppen) became, for 
        me, a description of the mental environment in which we lived. Dogma, 
        in Oppen's usage, delimited the totality of the philosophical, cultural 
        and aesthetic views which we lived under. The first duty of the poet was 
        to make himself aware of this fundamental condition, then to find a means 
        of overcoming or subverting it through art. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        I reflect now on that correspondence, I wonder if I was turning Oppen's 
        words into another dogma? If so, it felt like a dogma of openness, of 
        receptivity to the world about me, and so came with that curious admixture 
        of total freedom and total responsibility for what I was up to as a poet. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oppen's 
        letter had, in this instance, been partially in response to a question 
        I put to him: "Is it a poetry that one writes?" and his answer in that 
        letter framed the paradox I was living in: </font></p>

            'is it a poetry that one writes?' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is

      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Possibly 
        these words led to nowhere and everywhere, but in them I felt deeply, 
        for good and surely for possible ill, the absence of prescription, the 
        refusal to impose a stylistics or mode upon one. They placed the act of 
        the poem back, nakedly, with its maker. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">**</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
        made Oppen's letters so powerful for me was the generality I hint at above. 
        How to explain the effect of this generality? After all, poetry (to paraphrase 
        Robert Frost) is at war with generality. Yet, as I read Oppen's work in 
        the late sixties and came to know something of his personal history, the 
        universality and even abstractness of his correspondence came to seem 
        a kind of framing device, an arena which bracketed his poetic activity, 
        heightened its gravity and disclosed the limit, for Oppen, of what could 
        possibly be articulated by the poem. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, 
        the poetry itself enacted, through its unique mixtures of poetic imagery 
        and rhetoric, the boundary conditions of its own making, that dance between 
        the known and the unknown which has been Oppen's singular contribution 
        to twentieth century poetry. Oppen, from the first, struck me as a very 
        different kind of poet from those of his generation, including his &quot;objectivist&quot; 
        peers, who came out of the Pound&#150;Williams lineage and who were influenced 
        in one way or another by Imagist theory and doctrine. In his practice, 
        he departed radically not only from those poets but also from those who, 
        coming after, would call him an influence. For me, this difference lies 
        in how he used the poetic image, the building block of modern poetry, 
        in an entirely different way from these other poets. For Oppen, the image, 
        as I've written elsewhere, is neither descriptive not decorative but investigatory. 
        It registers instead an impingement of a world upon him, and in following 
        out in a phenomenological manner the dictates of this new knowledge, the 
        element of vision becomes a kind of thinking. The concretions of the visible 
        world and language which constitute the main element of his poetry rather 
        than showing or putting the world on display led the reader unerringly 
        to the brink of the unknown, to the sense of something incalculable, as, 
        for example, in this excerpt from "Of Being Numerous:"</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
        powerful passage, one of my favorites, as it moves from philosophical 
        statement to an uncannily ordinary and precise perceptual moment, both 
        consoles and takes away its consolations in the same poetic breath. Technically, 
        the strategically placed "O if" of the fourth stanza and the "Or" of the 
        fifth stanza (which has no clear antecedent) undermine the closures of 
        imagist poetry that are usually invoked by a visual datum. Here, these 
        ingenuities but also the propelled dynamics of the language, produce an 
        entirely different effect. One feels &#150; and this was one of Oppen's 
        most powerful teachings to me &#150; that the poet is groping within his 
        own uncertainty, trying to resolve his own state of being as he reaches 
        for that which can not be articulated in language.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        a number of other letters to me, Oppen spoke directly of his own poetry 
        as such a linguistic and phenomenological quest, an attempt to bring word 
        and world, or reality into charged consonance, as in this excerpt:</font></p>

          emerged as <i>objects</i> - - - - can we suppose, in the history of

	  </dir>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        his way, Oppen was reversing the contemporary ordering of our thought, 
        making the poem carry the reader from the known to the unknown, rather 
        than the other way around. He wanted to be precise, but also to preserve 
        the mystery of substance and otherness which he felt was at the root of 
        our creative lives. His poetry, looked at carefully, is thus at odds not 
        only with the gelid wastes of official literary culture but also with 
        the programmed experimentalisms of much of the avant-garde. This was his 
        strength, his radicality, and also the reason, I think, for which critics 
        and the poetry establishment have found it difficult to come to terms 
        with his work. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">**</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We 
        wanted to know if we were any good out there," Oppen wrote in "Disasters," 
        one of his later poems. The phrase was not meant to examine a career in 
        poetry in any competitive way; rather, it invoked, in its almost primal 
        simplicity, the whole range of ethical questioning which had precipitated, 
        in the Thirties, Oppen's poetic silence, a silence that lasted twenty-five 
        years. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        remember reading those words and the sudden effect they had on me. In 
        particular those two words "out there." They provided the fulcrum by which 
        I was both able to feel deeply in Oppen's debt and yet also feel that 
        I was a poet separate and responsible for my own work. I suppose, in saying 
        this, I am mainly rejecting the idea that poetry is not a force in the 
        world, and instead affirming my belief that both good and bad come of 
        it.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">**</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George 
        Oppen died in 1984, in a California nursing home. Still, increasingly, 
        I find my state of mind ever ready to invite the dead poet to reenter 
        the household of my psychic and artistic economy. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        did not see much of George in his last days, but I do recall his final 
        visit to NY when Verna Gillis and I made a tape for Windmill of him reading 
        from his work. This event, as though closing a certain kind of circle, 
        took place in Harvey Shapiro's house where I had first met him. At the 
        time, George was very frail and Mary hovered protectively over our taping 
        sessions. George had lost not only his energy but also the power of intense 
        concentration which had made his poetry so compact and powerful. He could 
        read no more than a dozen lines at a time, and we had to stop frequently, 
        sometimes even to remind George where he was in the poem. Verna and I 
        had set up a makeshift taping studio in one of the bedrooms. Across the 
        hall, there was another room with a day bed where George sat or lay down 
        to rest between the short bouts of reading, eyes open, with a copy of 
        his <i>Collected Poems</i> folded on his chest. There was a touch of fear 
        in his eyes, and already one sensed he was peering into the very incalculable 
        which his poetry had so assiduously courted. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later, 
        Verna effected a miracle by splicing the minute bits of poems into an 
        almost seamless recital. When, recently, Oppen's literary archive became 
        available to scholars, I was amazed to discover that George's method of 
        composition in the poems had, all along, involved the splicing and pasting 
        down of little slips of paper on which he might earlier have written anything 
        from a word to single lines or passages. What had held that collage of 
        language together, what had given an impressive coherence to his work, 
        had been the ethical and philosophical depth he spoke from, a depth which 
        anchored the most disparate language and tonalities. Oppen had spent his 
        entire time as a poet searching for and recreating in these structures 
        the uneasy meeting place of uncertainty and existence. When Verna and 
        I had finished with the production of the tape, we had assumed we had 
        put the poet back together. In fact, we had merely complied with the inmost 
        dictates of Oppen's own poetry. </font></p>
