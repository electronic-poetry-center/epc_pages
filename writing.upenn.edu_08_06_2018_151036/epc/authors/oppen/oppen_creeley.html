  <tr>
    <td width="21%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="79%" align="left" valign="top"><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One finds so many insistences
        upon the presumption that,
        as Auden said, &quot;Poetry makes nothing happen.&quot; Somehow poems therefore
        are supposed to be without value, just an indulgent pastime, an avoidance of
        the workaday world in which we otherwise have to live. Yet, on the other hand,
        one knows that poetry has often been felt to be tacitly subversive&mdash;an arousal
        of feelings contrary to the status quo, a calling together of mutual sympathies
        and recognitions altogether against the grain. It's no surprise that Federico
        Garcia Lorca's poems, for example, were crucial to Spain's Republican soldiers
        in that country's Civil War (1936&ndash;39), or that Plato, centuries earlier, hoping
        to secure an inclusive if dogmatic system of government, wanted all poets
        removed from the body politic at the outset. Then their curious ability to stir
        things up could be comfortably avoided.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, no one finally knows what a poet is supposed
        either to be or to do. Especially in this country, one takes on the job&mdash;because
        all that one does in America is considered a &quot;job&quot;&mdash;with no clear
        sense as to what is required or where one will ultimately be led. In that
        respect, it is as particular an instance of a &quot;calling&quot; as one might
        point to. For years I've kept in mind, &quot;Many are called but few are chosen.&quot;
        Even so &quot;called,&quot; there were no assurances that one would be
        answered.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most intriguing to me is that George Oppen became
        the primary poet he turns out to be truly against the odds. There are no signs
        or facts of circumstance arguing his possible transformation from the securely
        provided child of a well-to-do family into the spare, self-determined, isolate
        and unremitting person he turns into. No doubt his seemingly never-ending
        travels argue his ability to move as feelings and need proposed, but always he
        managed to find commonplace means wherewith to support himself and his wife,
        Mary. It is Mary who best makes clear the motive, which prompts them:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were constantly
        searching&mdash;searching in our travels, in our pursuit of friends and in our
        conversation concerning<br /> 
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that we saw and felt about the world. We were
        searching for a way to avoid the trap that our class backgrounds held<br /> 
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for us if
        we relented in our escape from them ... We wanted to see a great deal of the
        world, and the education of which<br /> 
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we talked for ourselves was to leave our
        class and learn our life by throwing ourselves into it.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mary Oppen, <i>Meaning a Life: an Autobiography)</i></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of Oppen's own life did not
        fit a simple pattern and this was not at all a fact of his own choosing. The early
        loss of his mother by suicide, the step-mother with whom he finds little
        rapport or sympathy, his teenage accident while still in military academy,
        involving the death of a
        passenger and his own expulsion for drinking, the earlier shift of the family from
        New Rochelle, New York (where he was born in 1908) to the other end of the
        country, San Francisco, even the probably therapeutic trip with his father to
        Europe in the year he is forced to leave school (1925) must be signs or markers
        for a childhood and adolescence scarred by tragedy and familial displacement.
        The travels, then, that he and Mary undertake are like those of the fairy-tale,
        wherein the two children, holding hands tightly, set off through the woods to
        discover the bluebird of happiness and the home</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">they know themselves to have been driven from and to which
        they must at last return. So it is, as Mary writes, &quot;the people we met, as
        various and as accidentally met as thumbing a ride could make them, became the
        clue to our finding roots; we gained confidence that this country was ours in a
        sense which we hadn't known under our parents' roofs. The sense was not only
        patriotic but a personal one, for as people generally accepted us, we felt as
        comfortable and at home in our country. I have never felt so at home in any
      other land.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">William Carlos Williams, a poet
        whom George Oppen much respected, makes the point that &quot;the poet thinks
        with his poem, in that lies his thought,
        and that in itself is the profundity.&quot; It was the Oppen's Objectivist
        Press, which published Williams' <i>Collected Poems, 1921-1931 </i>in 1934. The name of the press is
        also significant in that the Objectivists, consisting of the poets George Oppen, Charles
        Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, Louis
        Zukofsky and Williams himself, were the decisive conjunction, which gave Oppen
        his company and ground. However different they were later to find their
        lives&mdash;particularly so in the instance of Oppen and Zukofsky&mdash;all worked from the
        premise that poetry is a function of perception, &quot;of the act of perception,&quot;
        as Oppen emphasizes in his one defining essay, &quot;The Mind's Own
        Place.&quot; Oppen's complex 'thinking with his poems' is a consistent and
        major factor in all his surviving work. I think much becomes clear, in fact,
        if one recognizes that George Oppen is trying all his life to <i>think </i>the
        worId, not only to find or to enter it, or to gain a place in it&mdash;but to <i>realize </i>it,
        to <i>figure</i> it, to have it literally in mind. Poetics itself is the art of <i>figuration, </i>of configuring, so to speak, of making a picture, an <i>imago mundi, </i>which can serve as the (or a) whole world. Just so, Zukofsky said one might spend a lifetime considering the
        difference between &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a,&quot; the particular and
        the general.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In hindsight it may seem odd that
        such a brilliant and also privileged person as Oppen should have given his
        political commitment to the Communism of that period. But one forgets how
        preoccupied with viable political systems the whole time was&mdash;and necessarily so. The Depression, as well as the
        incessant wars of the 20th century, both civil and international, increased
        dramatically the implacable distance between the haves and the have-nots. The
        grinding and heartbreaking poverty of a great number of the world's people made
        an insistent impression upon those given the chance&mdash;really, the <i>leisure</i>&mdash;to think
        of it at all. Of course, all yearned for &quot;one's place in the sun&quot; but
        very few indeed were ever permitted to secure it. So, given their own
        provision, those as Oppen were particularly aware of their privilege, if they
        had not simply accepted the fact of their good fortune and taken their lives as
        thus granted.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other words, one begins to
        recognize this active, restless intelligence, often brooding in its
        preoccupation, endlessly returning to its determined premises, tracking and
        retracking an implacable ground of apparent consequences. <i>Why is this so? What so defines it? Is it the case in all instances? What </i>are <i>the givens? What inheres in the fact &quot;of being numerous&quot;? What </i>is<i> the &quot;this&quot; &quot;in which&quot; what is? </i>If I tease these terms here, my
        wish is to make clear that we are reading not only a unique collection of
        poems&mdash;and what <i>are </i>poems?&mdash;but also a rhetoric of <i>thinking, </i>a
        &quot;grammar [in Kenneth Burke's phrase] of motives,&quot; an immensely human
        attempt to have the world in mind and, in that heroic act, to insure that all
        is included, all provided and thought of&mdash;not at all as details, a kind of
        Noah's Ark of particulars, but rather as the imagination of a total
        &quot;place,&quot; which provides for all that can be put there, each particular
      and local 'thing.&rsquo;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Small wonder that George Oppen was not engaged with</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the usual poetry of his time. We
        too have forgotten how many of the writers of the nineteen thirties and forties
        shared his political thinking. Who now remembers the poems of Norman Macleod,
        for example, who was in 1930 the most published poet in America, invited to
        Moscow by the Russian government in respect of his accomplishments and
        convictions? In 1935, coincident with joining the Communist Party, Oppen
        stopped writing, noting later in a daybook, &quot;Surely there are situations
        in which it's absurd to write poetry! One could approach his own death with
        poetry&mdash;I should think one would. But a slaughter, a slaughter for which he
        bears perhaps some responsibility? Or, he does what he does. I don't know what
        one &quot;should&quot; do . . . &quot; So he as well was to find himself in
        Mexico some twenty years later with the Hollywood Ten script writers, whose
        &quot;leftist&quot; commitment had forced them to seek political asylum in
        order to escape Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Committee on
        Un-American Activities' attacks and accusations.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly poets before Oppen have
        given up writing for such a length of time. There was Paul Val&eacute;ry who stopped
        writing poetry for a like twenty years and then picked up again with his
        masterpiece, &quot;Le Cimeti&egrave;re Marin.&quot; Many speak of writer's block, of
        finding themselves with nothing to say and no means to say it. Or others, as
        Oppen, feel that writing itself is impossible in a world so committed to
        self&shy;destruction and despair. Yet poetry would seem to be an art like swimming
      or riding a bicycle. Once learned, one does not forget even if one wants to.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still the confounding ethical
        question of how one can speak as <i>one </i>in a time when <i>all</i> are so
        threatened hardly disappears because one is a poet. For Oppen the singular
        act of</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">poetry could not outweigh the need
        to work in concert with those he felt oppressed&mdash;in a common employment, in
        a</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">clearly committed political
        determination. His being wounded in the Second World War, serving as a common
        soldier, is a unique validation for him and one he much values thereafter. It
        was not until 1958 that Oppen began to write again and to undertake the work of
        finding publication.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If I think now of Oppen's
        incessantly restless travels, his shifting sense of company, I must realize I
        finally know him only in his poems despite he left both journals and letters,
        which are a very useful information in themselves of both the time and the
        person. But in the end the poems are the significant record, even when
        unwritten, thinking now of the more than twenty years of their hiatus. They say
        what he felt could be said, which, for him then, was a necessary and painful
        silence.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps
        this is what poetry can &quot;make happen,&quot; an inscription of the apparent
        world which registers its relation to our transient human lives&mdash;something that
        will matter, something that can count. One reads in Oppen's poems a record of
        thought compacted with feeling, a register of what might be finally that
        &quot;this in which&quot; our lives might have their determining value. He
        recognizes and insists that we are &quot;numerous,&quot; a complex
        &quot;many&quot;&mdash;yet, as Robinson Crusoe's presence would emphasize, he knows
      himself finally as one:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whether, as the intensity of

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, of course I know, I can enter no other place</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I am one of those who from

      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No
        selection as this can be managed simply as one person's decision, however
        much I stand responsible for the poems here included. When I read them now, I
        hear George Oppen's voice underlying&mdash;quite deep, poised, reflective in its movement, without aggressive emphasis.
        It is as if one listens to his thinking, the slowly secured phrases, the
        syntax taking each step.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then my
        fellow poet Robert Duncan's love for him and his work persuades me&mdash;as George
        Oppen would make his own love for Duncan clear in his letters. The one poet</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">complemented the other&mdash;the unembarrassed fullness of Duncan's rhetoric fits unexpectedly the modes of Oppen's spare thought. Both wanted the whole world as their ground and each worked always
        to enter it. I learned from them a measure for &quot;democracy&quot; in all its many, shifting
        guises.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most particularly
        here my resource has been the defining editor of George Oppen's poetry,
        Michael Davidson, whose crucial <i>New Collected Poems </i>(2002) gave me the text from which I made </font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">my selections. I
        also felt that a brief, compacted, chronology for Oppen's life would serve a real purpose and asked another old friend and fellow poet's
        help with providing it. Thanks to Rachel Blau DuPlessis, the reader can review</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">for him or herself the
        &quot;incessantly restless travels [and] shifting sense of company&quot; I
        refer to. She has also given us an exceptionally useful edition of Oppen's
        correspondence, <i>The Selected Letters of George
        Oppen </i>(1990),
        which, together with Mary Oppen's <i>Meaning a Life </i>(1978), makes an active context
        for the poems and the world in which they were written. Stephen Cope
        (University of California, San Diego) has kindly provided the two texts, which
        follow the poems themselves. His edition of Oppen's various prose forthcoming
        from the University of California Press will be a welcome addition to the
        canon.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then
        the river necessarily widens for me, from friends of years, such as Burt
        Hatlen, Peter Quartermain and Ted Enslin, to those younger as Charles
        Bernstein, Stephen Fredman and John Taggart. All have had much to do with Oppen
        and they were much in my own mind as I attempted to resolve this book. My work
        was always fact of any day's instance&mdash;conversation with a friend such as Ben
        Friedlander, or Carla Billitteri's prompt help with getting the <i>Selected Letters </i>from the University of Maine at Orono's library. I talked to each a good
        deal about Oppen, about my own questions and confusions, all of which is
        composted here in one way or another. Finally I thank my editor in this
        undertaking, Jeffrey Yang of New Directions, whose useful enthusiasm and
        clarity made for me all the difference. Thus being instance &quot;of being
        numerous&quot; has its enduring pleasure.</font></p>
