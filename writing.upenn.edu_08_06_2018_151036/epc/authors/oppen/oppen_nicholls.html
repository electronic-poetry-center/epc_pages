      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
        friend remarked recently on the number of newly published books carrying 
        the word 'modernism' in their titles. 'Where desire used to be, now there's 
        modernism,' she rather wittily remarked, 'I wonder what that means.' I 
        wonder too. Is it that modernism, like desire, has become an increasingly 
        diverse, not to say polymorphous, phenomenon in the last decade or so? 
        Certainly, it's clear from the bibliographies in journals such as <i>Modernism/Modernity</i> 
        and <i>International Review of Modernism</i> that it's not just that the 
        volume of publication in the field has increased, but that modernism and 
        its works are being written about from a dazzling variety of new perspectives. 
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In calling my 
        own book <i>Modernisms</i> (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT1">1</a><a name="Ref1"></a>) I 
        had had a rather conventional aim in mind, namely to show that Anglo-American 
        modernism had to be seen in the context of parallel avant-garde movements 
        in Europe, that our 'own' modernism, so to speak, could no longer be assumed 
        to be the hegemonic one. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT2">2</a><a name="Ref2"></a>) But 
        what we have now begun to call the 'new modernisms' aim to shift the balance 
        in more radical ways, stressing, for example, the pivotal importance of 
        the Harlem Renaissance to American modernism or tracing modernism's interaction 
        with popular culture and movements of the political left &#150; areas 
        modernism itself had once seemed to discourage us from exploring. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT3">3</a><a name="Ref3"></a>) 
        Most fundamentally, perhaps, the shift in attention has been toward considerations 
        of modernism's relation to a variously defined 'public sphere'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT4">4</a><a name="Ref4"></a>) 
        Here a <i>post</i>modern concern with consumerism and identity politics 
        has produced a new fascination with what one critic has called 'the public 
        face of modernism', a public face discernible, for example, in the politics 
        of publishing and advertising. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT5">5</a><a name="Ref5"></a>) 
        Suddenly modernism has become a highly contagious phenomenon, yielding 
        initially surprising hybrids (modernism and psychoanalysis, modernism 
        and anarchism, modernism and psychiatry, modernism and the New Deal, and 
        so on). (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT6">6</a><a name="Ref6"></a>)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        various ways, these reconfigurations of modernism are the means of 'modernising' 
        it, by which I mean re-reading it in the light of the changing imperatives 
        of modernity. I want to take a rather different tack in this essay, however, 
        looking not for some new supplement to modernism (modernism and&#133;), 
        but rather examining some of the ways in which American modernism, my 
        chosen example here, generated counter-movements <i>within itself</i>, 
        movements which revised and contested what had gone before while remaining 
        within a paradigm we would still want to call 'modernist'. The particular 
        movement of revision and qualification I have in mind was initially labelled 
        'Objectivism', a loose grouping of poets &#150; George Oppen, Louis Zukofsky, 
        Lorine Niedecker, Carl Rakosi and Charles Reznikoff &#150; who appeared 
        on the literary scene in the early 1930s. Their manifesto, designedly 
        unsystematic, was framed by Zukofsky and published as 'Sincerity and Objectification' 
        in the February 1931 issue of <i>Poetry</i> magazine. One of the striking 
        things about this group of poets is that their careers were lengthy ones, 
        each of them publishing a major book as late as the 1970s, and thereby 
        bringing some disorder to a chronology which likes to see 'modernism' 
        expiring before the Second World War. To complicate matters further, two 
        of its members, Oppen and Rakosi, ceased writing altogether for a long 
        period of time. Oppen, on whom I shall concentrate here, published his 
        first book, <i>Discrete Series</i>, in 1934 and nothing else until 1962. 
        After his long period of silence, during which he worked as a communist 
        party labour organiser and ended up as an exile in Mexico, fleeing FBI 
        harassment, Oppen went on to publish a sequence of major volumes. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT7">7</a><a name="Ref7"></a>)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps 
        surprisingly, though, given this complicated chronology, critics have 
        until recently tended to emphasise the essential continuity of the Objectivists' 
        work with that of the so-called high modernists, and notably of Ezra Pound. 
        Hugh Kenner, for example, one of the earliest commentators on the group, 
        saw them as representing primarily a turn toward an authentic American 
        subject-matter. Their aim, he says, was 'to make cosmopolis anew, to make 
        it here at home'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT8">8</a><a name="Ref8"></a>) The importance 
        of the Objectivists for Kenner is that they bring to fulfilment the promise 
        of an earlier generation of modernist writers: indeed, he says, 'they 
        seem to have been born mature, not to say middle-aged. The quality of 
        their very youthful work is that of men who have inherited a formed tradition: 
        the tradition over the cradle of which, less than twenty years previously, 
        Ezra Pound had hoped to have Henry James, O.M., speak a few sponsoring 
        words.' This is, we might think, a surprisingly narrow view of a group 
        of writers whose works were in fact profoundly marked by Jewishness, Marxism, 
        surrealism, even by a tentative feminism &#150; precisely those elements, 
        of course, that Kenner's particular brand of high modernism would regard 
        as troublingly 'foreign'. Yet the fit between Objectivism and Poundian 
        modernism was actually not at all as seamless as Kenner suggests, partly 
        because, as I've already noted, the chronology involved is an extended 
        and (in the case of Oppen and Rakosi) a broken one; but also because Objectivism 
        arguably reconfigured Poundian modernism by its particular attraction 
        to forms of foreignness and alterity &#150; to things and experiences 
        valued precisely for their unhomely quality. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
        might not seem to claim much to say, for example, that American writers 
        were drawn to the work of Europeans, or even that this contact introduced 
        them to forms of writing attuned to negativity, scepticism, and the inevitability 
        of aesthetic 'failure' &#150; a tradition running from Mallarm&eacute;, 
        on into writers such as Kafka, Musil and Beckett, and informing much recent 
        continental speculation about literary production (the work of Maurice 
        Blanchot is an obvious example). Critics such as Kenner, though, have 
        tended to read Objectivism as a turn to a kind of authentic Americanism 
        rather than to see that its often sceptical tenor bespeaks a radical questioning 
        of the political and transcendental underpinnings of the Poundian poetic. 
        Even William Carlos Williams, author of <i>In the American Grain</i>, 
        could observe late in his life that 'My eyes have been so unfailingly 
        directed toward Europe, toward what has come out of Paris especially, 
        that I had little interest in anything else. You may be surprised to hear 
        a man who has so identified with American beginnings say this but it is 
        so. The very shock of America to my nerves has made me the more European 
        in my instinctive reactions.' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT9">9</a><a name="Ref9"></a>) 
        Objectivist poet Lorine Niedecker provides another example. Frequently 
        read as the epitome of a small-scale, 'homely' poet, Niedecker in her 
        late work was in fact significantly influenced by her encounter with contemporary 
        French poets like Jean Daive and Andr&eacute; du Bouchet. In their writing 
        she discovered distinctly unhomely forms of 'abstractionism', as she called 
        it, forms which, as one of Daive's reviewers described them, sought to 
        'substitute for real space a mental space, a place&#133;empty, impossible, 
        undermined by the least sign of rootedness.' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT10">10</a><a name="Ref10"></a>)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
        idea of an undermining of rootedness will be one of my main concerns here, 
        particularly insofar as it impacts on ways of defining the legitimate 
        scope and ambition of the poetic enterprise, and, in acknowledging certain 
        limits to these, also reconfigures in fundamental ways the relation of 
        writing to cognitive process. One way of grasping this aspect of American 
        modernism's evolution is by looking first at Pound's <i>Cantos</i>, a 
        poem which, in contravention of its original formal aims, came increasingly 
        to epitomise a fantasy of groundedness and 'home'. The tension between 
        beginning and end in Pound's poem, between an initial exilic openness 
        and a concluding desire for rootedness, arguably provided one spur to 
        the 'modernisation' of modernism which I shall attribute to Oppen. In 
        the latter's work, the figure of exile and homelessness would be a significant 
        feature of a reformulated modernism, a figure frequently associated with 
        a conception of Europe as 'other'.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
        of which may remind us once again of the complicated nature of modernism's 
        chronology. For Oppen would only begin to write poetry again around the 
        time of Pound's release from St Elizabeths hospital in 1958 where he had 
        spent the past thirteen years waiting to stand trial for treason. Monument 
        to 'high' modernism though they may be, Pound's <i>Cantos</i> were in 
        fact still appearing, with the section called <i>Thrones</i> published 
        in 1959, and a final volume, <i>Drafts and Fragments</i>, issued as late 
        as 1969. Dates such as these play havoc with customary ways of containing 
        modernism within the first half of the century. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT11">11</a><a name="Ref11"></a>) 
        And perhaps even more important, this acknowledgment of the extended history 
        of modernism invites us to weigh the later <i>Cantos</i> in the same balance 
        as European works like Thomas Mann's <i>Doctor Faustus</i> and Hermann 
        Broch's <i>The Death of Virgil</i>, works which sought to evaluate the 
        modernist project in the light of a modernity now 'ruined' by the disaster 
        of a second World War. In fact, Broch's novel, published in 1945, offers 
        numerous points of comparison with Pound's <i>Pisan Cantos</i>, published 
        three years later. Both texts regard the War as marking a seismic faultline 
        in history which calls in question the very nature of art's function. 
        On the day before his death, Broch's Virgil dreams of destroying his <i>Aeneid</i>, 
        a work he now feels to be somehow inhuman in its sacrifice of ethics to 
        aesthetics and in its misplaced celebration of the Roman state. Like Pound 
        in the death cells at Pisa, Broch had had his own intimations of mortality 
        when imprisoned by the Gestapo, and his novel weighs his sense of human 
        finitude against what he now sees as the failure of art's metaphysical 
        pretensions. The future, which Virgil himself will not live to see, belongs 
        to Christianity, and the novel's scepticism about art is the means by 
        which Virgil is finally able to see something beyond its autotelic laws, 
        something which is both individual and shared, the absolute exteriority 
        of death. The great symbolic figures of Broch's novel and its construction 
        as a series of 'musical' and cosmic movements through the four elements, 
        from 'Water &#150; the Arrival' to 'Air &#150; the Homecoming', certainly 
        resonate with the similar but more fragmented images of T<i>he Pisan Cantos</i>, 
        as does its intricate sense of what Broch describes as 'past and future 
        cross[ing] each other'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT12">12</a><a name="Ref12"></a>) Yet 
        while Pound is also counting the cost of art's failed engagement with 
        politics, <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, in contrast to Broch's novel, attribute 
        that failure not to the shortcomings of art but to the politicians who 
        have refused to learn from it. Hence the remarkable stoicism of the sequence 
        and its never wavering belief that a poetic language of 'rectitude', as 
        Pound calls it, might somehow survive the debacle of Mussolini's regime, 
        like a diamond 'torn from its setting', even though its desired political 
        embodiment lies in ruins. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT13">13</a><a name="Ref13"></a>)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 
        this point on, <i>The Cantos</i>, while continuing to expand its range 
        of reference through <i>Section: Rock-Drill</i> and <i>Thrones</i>, will 
        at the same time seek a ground or home in radically simplified forms of 
        social order. Aesthetic modernism here survives, but only by banishing 
        modernity as referent and antagonist. In contrast to Virgil's homecoming, 
        which discloses a sort of 'outside' to art, something inexpressible which 
        lies beyond its powers of representation, Pound's progressive dissolution 
        of 'history' in myths of organic stability produces an exactly opposite 
        motion, with the poem increasingly turning in on itself. Pound's Confucianism 
        is now dedicated to an extreme localism: 'Earth and water dye the wind 
        in your valley', he writes (703), 'Establish the homestead' (718), 'One 
        village in order' (723), and so on. 'The plan,' we are told, 'is in nature/rooted' 
        (723) and the social order is likewise organic and external: 'The State 
        is corporate/as with pulse in its body' (721), 'The whole tribe is from 
        one man's body' (722). The landscapes of these <i>Cantos</i> live in what 
        Bakhtin calls 'folkloric' time, not in history, producing what Bakhtin 
        calls 'This little spatial world&#133;limited and sufficient unto itself, 
        not linked in any intrinsic way with other places, with the rest of the 
        world'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT14">14</a><a name="Ref14"></a>)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pound's 
        narrowing of focus and his deliberately parochial sense of value seem 
        distant indeed from the nomadic drive of the earlier <i>Cantos</i>, where 
        multilingualism, as George Steiner once remarked, placed Pound in a modernist 
        company which included self-consciously exilic writers such as Joyce, 
        Beckett, Borges, Nabokov and Pessoa. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT15">15</a><a name="Ref15"></a>) 
        Pound's late turn toward 'home' is, of course, freighted with ideological 
        investments, reminding us of his wartime denunciations of Judaism not 
        only for its alleged 'intellectualism', but also for the nomadic and anti-agrarian 
        basis of what he had called its 'anti-statal' values. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT16">16</a><a name="Ref16"></a>) 
        Recoiling from Fascism's disastrous end and, indeed, from his own personal 
        disaster which had brought him to the brink of a trial for treason, Pound 
        discovered in the imagery of an idealised feudalism the key to a perfectly 
        enclosed and finished world in which language seemed absolutely to embrace 
        its objects.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In its repudiation 
        of the modernity that lay 'outside', the world of the late <i>Cantos</i> 
        invites comparison with that of another important European novel which 
        sought to reckon with cultural 'disaster', Hermann Hesse's <i>The Glass 
        Bead Game</i>. Hesse's novel ironically projects a distant future in which 
        culture has survived only by becoming an elitist, semi-religious game. 
        Like an unimaginably complex form of chess, the game is played with cultural 
        fragments: it might start, says Hesse, 'from a sentence out of Leibnitz 
        or the Upanishads, and from this theme, depending on the intentions and 
        talents of the player, it could either further explore the initial motif, 
        or else enrich its expressiveness by allusion to kindred concepts.' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT17">17</a><a name="Ref17"></a>) 
        The form of the game, modelled on fugue and counterpoint, and developing 
        an 'international language of symbols' akin, says Hesse, to 'the ancient 
        Chinese script' cannot but remind us of Pound's later <i>Cantos</i>, and 
        uncomfortably so, since the Glass Bead Game exemplifies not only an ideal 
        of artistic autonomy but also the social remoteness of the intellectuals 
        who play it and the disastrous aestheticisation of politics which their 
        withdrawal ultimately permits. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For younger writers 
        like Oppen, <i>The Cantos</i> similarly refused to reckon with the brutal 
        facts of political disaster ('Pound, the encyclopedic, didn't speak of 
        the gas chambers'). (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT18">18</a><a name="Ref18"></a>) We might 
        gauge the nature of that refusal by considering briefly another approach 
        to 'disaster', that of Maurice Blanchot. For Blanchot, the 'disaster' 
        is a condition of being outside dialectic and history. It is, for that 
        reason, not to be understood as an empirical, apocalyptic event (though 
        in <i>The Writing of the Disaster</i>, Blanchot does signal the holocaust 
        as 'the <i>absolute</i> event of history' ). (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT19">19</a><a name="Ref19"></a>) 
        It entails, as one commentator puts it, 'a concept of exteriority rather 
        than of catastrophe'; (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT20">20</a><a name="Ref20"></a>) it 
        is, says Blanchot, 'the force of writing' but, at the same time, something 
        'excluded from it' as 'the limit of writing'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT21">21</a><a name="Ref21"></a>) 
        The 'disaster', something never directly experienced, is what makes us, 
        says Blanchot, 'uprooted creatures, deprived by language itself of language 
        &#150; of language understood as <i>ground</i> where the germinal root 
        would plunge, and as the promise of a developing life'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT22">22</a><a name="Ref22"></a>) 
        The terms Blanchot uses here are fortuitously appropriate ones in which 
        to talk about Pound, who early in his life had himself celebrated the 
        visionary powers of what he called the 'germinal universe' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT23">23</a><a name="Ref23"></a>) 
        and who much later would speak in Canto XCIX /723 of 'the plan&#133;in 
        nature /rooted'; but, of course, Blanchot's use of such terms points up 
        the absolute divergence between him and Pound in their respective sense 
        of what 'disaster' is. For the final stages of <i>The Cantos</i> are driven 
        by two main impulses: one, to constitute history itself as disaster (precisely 
        the opposite move to Blanchot's and one which allows Pound to retain concepts 
        of tradition, futurity and the sacred, while reinscribing history as fate 
        and conspiracy); the other, to discover somewhere in the closing movements 
        of his long poem the promise of an ending by which the 'ruined' and fragmentary 
        remains of history might recompose themselves in a figure of homecoming 
        powerful enough to contain the centrifugal tendencies of a poem that now 
        seemed to its author perilously 'nomadic'. For Blanchot, of course, it 
        is precisely this threat of some solipsistic closure that is to be resisted. 
        Again using terms similar to Pound's, but with a predictably different 
        inflection, Blanchot asserts that being Jewish is 'an affirmation of nomadic 
        truth', whereas 'To be pagan is to plant oneself in the earth, as it were, 
        to establish oneself through a pact with the permanence that authorizes 
        sojourn and is certified by certainty in the land.' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT24">24</a><a name="Ref24"></a>) 
        For Blanchot, this very 'fixity' is the mark of a blindness to the claims 
        of the other, a form of self-possession which refuses the challenge of 
        exteriority.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        want to suggest that, in attempting to meet just this challenge, the Objectivists 
        sought a new kind of encounter with modernity, one which propelled them 
        in a direction quite opposite to Pound's trajectory in the late <i>Cantos</i>. 
        (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT25">25</a><a name="Ref25"></a>) In Oppen's case, his return 
        to poetry in the late fifties opened a perspective on modernism as something 
        precisely lacking in any 'fixity' or ground. As with Blanchot's notion 
        of 'disaster', Oppen's sense of poetry's unrootedness signified at once 
        the damaged condition of post-war modernity <i>and</i> the kind of formal 
        openness which would be the only guarantee of poetry's survival in the 
        future. His divergence from Poundian modernism was thus inevitable and, 
        as comments in his personal notes or 'Daybooks' show, not just for ideological 
        reasons but for technical, poetic ones as well. 'Pound,' he remarks, 'never 
        freed himself from argument, the moving of chess pieces', (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT26">26</a><a name="Ref26"></a>) 
        and whether or not Oppen here recalls Pound's early 'The Game of Chess', 
        where the 'moves break and reform the pattern', (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT27">27</a><a name="Ref27"></a>) 
        he conceives of 'argument' as a 'game of thought' in which each 'piece' 
        has its meaning assigned in advance. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT28">28</a><a name="Ref28"></a>) 
        It may seem odd that Oppen should fault the elliptical and fragmented 
        modes of <i>The Cantos</i> for being an 'argument', but his choice of 
        that word points up a significant divergence between his poetics and Pound's. 
        At issue are not merely the <i>argumentative</i> habits of the older poet's 
        work and the hectoring tone of the late stages of his poem, but, more 
        importantly, what Oppen sees as a tendency there to the same kind of closure 
        and solipsism that characterise Hesse's imaginary game. If poetry is to 
        serve as 'a test of truth', as Oppen puts it in one of his rare prose 
        statements, it has to resist the attractions of self-legitimating 'argument': 
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is possible to 
          say anything in abstract prose, but a great many things one believes 
          or would like to believe or things he believes will not substantiate 
          themselves in the concrete materials of the poem. It is not to say that 
          the poet is immune to the &quot;real&quot; world to say that he is not 
          likely to find the moment, the image, in which a political generalization 
          or any other generalization will prove its truth. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT29">29</a><a name="Ref29"></a>)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Oppen aims at 
        in his own work, then, is 'Not argument of thought, nor even the argument 
        of the I, but the argument of consciousness./ Consciousness in itself 
        and of itself carries the principle of actualness / for it itself is actual.' 
        (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT30">30</a><a name="Ref30"></a>) The distinction is fundamental 
        to Oppen's thinking, partly because it stresses the openness of the poem, 
        the tentativeness of its movement toward a future horizon, but also because 
        it sets a limit to scepticism by locating one 'truth' which is not open 
        to doubt: 'Impossible to doubt the actualness of one's own consciousness: 
        but therefore consciousness in itself, of itself, by itself carries the 
        principle of ACTUALNESS for it, itself, is actual beyond doubt.' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT31">31</a><a name="Ref31"></a>) 
        A reality, then, not known in advance and not grounded in the echoing 
        continuum of 'tradition' &#150; this is the locus of a poetics for which 
        'there must be no possible impression of a statement having been put into 
        verse'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT32">32</a><a name="Ref32"></a>) Rather, 'the thinking 
        occurs at the moment of the poem, within the poem[.] As the image forms 
        in the mind, forms in the present and surrounds me tho it may speak of 
        the past'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT33">33</a><a name="Ref33"></a>)<br>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">n 
        this context it is perhaps not surprising that Oppen prized Parmenides' 
        famous axiom, 'the same is to think and to be', (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT34">34</a><a name="Ref34"></a>) 
        and took one of his epigraphs for his 1965 collection <i>This In Which</i> 
        from Heidegger's discussion of Parmenides. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT35">35</a><a name="Ref35"></a>) 
        As his remarks about Pound suggest, Oppen may well have seen the divergence 
        between himself and the older poet as a reflection of the ancient divergence 
        proposed in Heidegger's essay. There Heidegger argues that with the Sophists 
        and Plato, a cleavage opened up between thinking and being, with the latter 
        term assimilated to the 'suprasensory realm' of the idea. 'Truth' then 
        became not the disclosure of being, but 'the correctness of the logos. 
        With this the logos has departed from its original inclusion in the happening 
        of unconcealment.' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT36">36</a><a name="Ref36"></a>) 'This 
        differentiation,' argues Heidegger, 'is a name for the fundamental attitude 
        of the Western spirit. In accordance with this attitude, being is defined 
        from the standpoint of thinking and reason' &#150; or 'argument', to use 
        Oppen's word. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT37">37</a><a name="Ref37"></a>) If poetry is 
        a rejection of this 'differentiation', it is because it offers (as Gerald 
        Bruns puts it) 'A language not for use: a language that can only be described 
        by a kind of topology, not by grammar or rules.' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT38">38</a><a name="Ref38"></a>)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What kind of 'topology' 
        might this be? Certainly, Oppen's late work, especially his last volume, 
        <i>Primitive</i>, pays little heed to rule and convention, working with 
        notoriously fragmented syntactic elements and exploiting the literal spaces 
        of the printed page. In addition to this, however, his reading of Heidegger 
        also leads to a significant reformulation of the idea of tradition that 
        had been so important to first generation Anglo-American modernists. For 
        Oppen, allusions to a cultural past, far from being pieces in a 'game 
        of thought', are the products of sudden intuitions, intrusions, even, 
        which substitute radical contingency for an ordered tradition. Michael 
        Heller remarks that 'all of Oppen's significant influences are given to 
        him <i>in extremis</i>', and this neatly catches the conjunction of chance 
        and anxiety that tends to characterise the irruption of other voices in 
        Oppen's work. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT39">39</a><a name="Ref39"></a>) So, puzzling 
        over his early poem about 'boredom' ('The knowledge not of sorrow'), he 
        notes that this was </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">an odd word to use. 
          I am touched by superstition remembering my hesitation over that word 
          and the sense of having been given it. Followed by a much later event, 
          involving a dream and all the trappings, in which I had dreamed quite 
          literally of being given a phrase over a telephone and, the following 
          morning wrote into a poem a quotation from a short essay of Heidegger's 
          which I had been reading the night before. When I checked the quotation 
          &#150; not there!' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT40">40</a><a name="Ref40"></a>)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heidegger's thought 
        is both foreign and resistant, manifesting itself in a kind of dreamlike 
        (and deceptive) dictation from 'outside' which undermines familiar certainties 
        of home and tradition. In contrast to the substantive 'piths and gists' 
        of <i>The Cantos</i>, the phrases Oppen draws from European thinkers such 
        as Heidegger, Hegel, Simone Weil, Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein have a 
        kind of evanescence about them, being already partly absorbed into the 
        occasion of Oppen's writing and modified by it. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT41">41</a><a name="Ref41"></a>) 
        They do not have an exemplary function or direct us back to some supplementary 
        source; rather, they allow the present tense of the poem's thought to 
        continue. Yet this movement forward is a highly tentative and precarious 
        one, lacking the kind of 'ground' that allusion was intended to secure 
        in <i>The Cantos</i>. The poetic intelligence is, accordingly, 'nomadic', 
        to use Blanchot's word, a prey to the 'anxiety' that Heidegger described 
        in his <i>Introduction to Metaphysics</i>, a text with which Oppen was 
        familiar:<br>
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In anxiety, we say, 
          'one feels ill at ease [es ist einem unheimlich].' What is 'it' that 
          makes 'one' feel ill at ease? We cannot say what it is before which 
          one feels ill at ease. As a whole it is so for him. All things and we 
          ourselves sink into indifference. This, however, not in the sense of 
          mere disappearance. Rather in this very receding things turn toward 
          us. The receding of beings as a whole that closes in on us in anxiety 
          oppresses us. We can get no hold on things. In the slipping away of 
          beings only this 'no hold on things' comes over us and remains&#133;.We 
          'hover' in anxiety. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT42">42</a><a name="Ref42"></a>)</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Unheimlich</i>, 
        or 'unhomelike', 'not-being-at-home' [<i>das Nicht-zuhause-sein</i>],

        might help to define a characteristic mood of Oppen's work ('One writes 
        in presence of something/Moving close to fear', as he puts it in one poem 
        [<i>CP</i>, 223]). This anxiety or 'dis-orientation' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT44">44</a><a name="Ref44"></a>) 
        is as much a formal as an emotional condition. It entails a particular 
        (ethical) stance toward the world, in face of which the loss of 'hold 
        on things' marks a refusal of knowledge and mastery.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two poems published 
        in the early seventies show how these ideas informed Oppen's critical 
        view of Poundian modernism. In the first of these, 'Of Hours', his 'Old 
        friend' is clearly rebuked for his egotism &#150; 'What is it you &quot;loved&quot;/ 
        Twisting your voice', Oppen asks in a sharp reminder of Pound's 'What 
        thou lovest well remains' &#150; but perhaps the most telling aspect of 
        the poem is its way of proposing its own elliptical structure as a critique 
        of Poundian self-certainty: 'Holes pitfalls open/ In the cop's accoutrement', 
        Oppen writes, invoking not only the literally fissured landscape of the 
        war in which he almost lost his own life, but also those syntactical 'holes' 
        and hesitancies that work to undermine the poet's authority. At the poem's 
        close, Pound pursues his way 'homeward' but remains 'unteachable'. Oppen 
        implies that it was the poet's monopoly on 'truth' that led to the 'twisting' 
        of his voice, and his own poem attempts a directness which equates sincerity 
        with the recognition of limits &#150; of, we might say, the world's resistance 
        to metaphor (hence we have the 'rubble' of Alsace rather than Pound's 
        visionary stone). (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT45">45</a><a name="Ref45"></a>) The second 
        poem, 'Speech at Soli', similarly takes Pound to task for his failure 
        of vision: 'war in incoherent/ sunlight it will not/ cohere it will NOT&#133;'. 
        (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT46">46</a><a name="Ref46"></a>) Only in a self-legitimating 
        'game of thought' can the 'incoherence' of war be sublated in aesthetic 
        form. Oppen's title, he explained in an interview, derived from his discovery 
        that 'the etymology of &quot;solipsism&quot; was the name of a place, 
        Soli. The Greeks, apparently, thought that town somewhere in Italy to 
        be a very barbarous place'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT47">47</a><a name="Ref47"></a>) 
        In contrast, then, to the Poundian 'solipsism', poetic language, in Oppen's 
        view, allows us not to grasp 'truth' as concept, but, quite the opposite, 
        to accept limits to our cognitive ambitions by creating a language which 
        recognises what he calls the 'impenetrability' of the world: 'That which 
        exists,' he says, 'can not be explained[.] it cannot be analyzed, it is 
        the object of contemplative thought, it is known by &quot;indwelling&quot;.' 
        (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT48">48</a><a name="Ref48"></a>) With this last, Heideggerian 
        word, Oppen gestures toward a world <i>in which</i> we have a place rather 
        than a world that offers itself as an object for knowledge (the title 
        of his third volume of poems, <i>This In Which</i>, seems to make precisely 
        this point). (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT49">49</a><a name="Ref49"></a>) That such a 
        world is 'impenetrable' does not mean, however, that it is unintelligible: 
        as the poems show, it is available to reflection, but its resistance to 
        reduction establishes it as powerfully different, as non-identical. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT50">50</a><a name="Ref50"></a>)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This sense of encountering 
        the world as something irreducibly other gives poetic language an unresolved, 
        lacunary quality, with syntactical openness and hesitancy constantly proposing 
        shared relationships and experiences without formulating them absolutely. 
        In a very specific sense, the language, with its 'holes' and 'pitfalls', 
        seems to fail in its attempt to grasp the real, and thought becomes a 
        matter of doubting rather than asserting or believing. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT51">51</a><a name="Ref51"></a>) 
        But it is this very failure, the 'holes' opening up in the fabric of language, 
        that allows the disclosure of 'the commonplace that pierces or erodes/The 
        mind's structure' (<i>CP</i>, 206). In an early letter to Cid Corman, 
        Oppen explains that </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think of form 
          as immediacy, as the possibility of being grasped. I look for the thinnest 
          possible surface.&#150; at times, no doubt, too thin : a hole, a lapse&#133;There 
          is no point in defending lapses &#150; but that is, of all risks the 
          one I plan to live with. I am much more afraid of a solid mass of words. 
          (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT52">52</a><a name="Ref52"></a>) </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The discursive order 
        of ' a solid mass of words' is 'pierced' by something that resists thematisation, 
        by 'The absolutely incomprehensible, which pierces any possible structure 
        of the mind'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT53">53</a><a name="Ref53"></a>) This particular 
        sense of lacunary structure is quite different from Pound's use of ellipsis 
        and juxtaposition in the late <i>Cantos</i>. As I have suggested elsewhere, 
        <i>Thrones</i>, the last main sequence of the poem, shows Pound increasingly 
        drawn to formulations of absolute identity, notably through expressions 
        of monetary value such as '8 stycas: one scat', '2 doits to a boodle' 
        and so on. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT54">54</a><a name="Ref54"></a>) His 'ideogrammic 
        method' had originally seemed to offer resistance to an identificatory 
        mode of thinking that would subsume objects to concepts, expressing instead 
        a kind of remainder always in excess of the process of adequation (in 
        defining the word 'red', for example, the ideogram containing 'rose', 
        'cherry', 'iron rust' and 'flamingo' instigates multiple displacements 
        away from any simple identification of subject and predicate). By way 
        of contrast, expressions such as '2 doits to a boodle' leave no remainder 
        and produce a moment of reified identity in which being &#150; the 'is' 
        of equivalence &#150; can express itself only as quantity. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oppen's aim, we might 
        say, is to redeem this 'is' from the closure of predication by launching 
        the poem in the direction of the 'is' of existence: 'if we still possessed 
        the word &quot;is&quot;, there would be no need to write poems', he observes. 
        (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT55">55</a><a name="Ref55"></a>) Hence his account of <i>Discrete 
        Series</i> as 'my own attempt toward the primacy of subject as against 
        predicate' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT56">56</a><a name="Ref56"></a>) as a way of defining 
        poetry in terms of what he calls its 'primary concern with postulation'. 
        (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT57">57</a><a name="Ref57"></a>) And again: 'the poem as process 
        of thought&#133;.The primacy of the nominative, which Hegel spoke of, 
        the primacy of subject. <i>Revelation in the nominative: there can be 
        no predicate of revelation</i>. It is never which is which[.]' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT58">58</a><a name="Ref58"></a>) 
        What Oppen calls his 'ontology', then, is arrived at by suspending the 
        predicative impulse, and as here he frequently dissociates this aim from 
        mere 'argument' or 'comment' by a (mis)quotation from Hegel: 'Disagreement 
        marks where the subject matter ends; it is what the subject matter is 
        not'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT59">59</a><a name="Ref59"></a>)<br>

        some 'outer limit' where the homelessness of drifting 'On the open water'

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can begin to see, 
        then, that in its larger movement at any rate, the poem seeks the 'absolute 
        antithesis' of the self in 'the obvious'; it is in that exilic, outward 
        journey that the self or ego is finally seen as something bounded and 
        limited, witness to 'the pride of life' only in its recognition of what 
        is not its self. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT64">64</a><a name="Ref64"></a>) It is not 
        surprising that the poem seems to court unintelligibility since Oppen's 
        commitment to the irreducibility of the real has to be embodied in a language 
        which itself abandons predication. The fragmentary first line thus warns 
        us in advance that this is a language that will not clarify itself through 
        the normal procedures of 'thought', but will leave us instead with words 
        and phrases which stubbornly refuse to be drawn into any kind of 'argument'. 
        There are literary allusions here &#150; perhaps to Eliot's 'I should 
        have been a pair of ragged claws/Scuttling across the floors of silent 
        seas' and to Stevens's 'The Idea of Order at Key West' &#150; but Oppen's 
        poem does not engage in ironic self-presentation or conjure with some 
        paradigm of aesthetic order. Instead, there is a desire for some pure 
        exteriority which allows the 'ego' to be defined only at the point at 
        which it runs up against what is not itself. There is an emphasis on the 
        'lust of the eyes', on the making manifest in the sudden flaming of the 
        dry straw, and this is contrasted with the poor who 'hide' together. It 
        may be that it is this rather cryptic reference to the poor that is borrowed 
        fromWeil, for in her book <i>Waiting on God</i> which Oppen knew she writes 
        of 'A popular Spanish song [which] says in words of marvellous truth: 
        &quot;If anyone wants to make himself invisible, there is no surer way 
        than to become poor.&quot;' (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT65">65</a><a name="Ref65"></a>) 
        If this is the passage Oppen has in mind it would support a reading that 
        emphasises some sort of turn from 'I' to 'we', redeeming a notion of collectivity 
        by embedding it in the 'obvious'. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Interestingly, it 
        was in just this way that Oppen responded to one interviewer who had rather 
        missed the point of this poem. The interviewer asks:<br>
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have you moved more, 
          in these poems, to an inner landscape? I'm saying this a little clumsily 
          but in the first poem you seem to start inside the 'dark jewel', then 
          move out to the actual world of the 'ragged birds' beaks', and finally 
          return back in to the 'limits of the ego'. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT66">66</a><a name="Ref66"></a>)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One can sympathise 
        with the interviewer's perplexity, but what is interesting is his ready 
        construal of the poem as 'an inner landscape' and his sense of it achieving 
        closure in a movement of <i>return</i> (a kind of homecoming, again). 
        Oppen is tactful but firm in his response:<br>
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did, however, 
          say <i>no</i> to the jewel. Unless the jewel sees: unless the jewel, 
          like a mirror, gives something <i>back</i>. I was speaking again of 
          my own specific response and not searching that interior. I said <i>no</i>, 
          and then said it's the lust of the eyes that moves the belly-wave. It 
          acknowledges the spirit and circumstances of where we are, of being 
          far at sea, of being among the elements. It's a little too complex to 
          reduce but it definitely rejects that inner space. It says <i>no</i> 
          to it except where the spirit moves out to infinity, or at least to 
          the given which I take to be infinite. (<a href="oppen_nicholls.html#FT67">67</a><a name="Ref67"></a>) 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oppen's account of 
        his poem is not completely clear, though his emphatic rejection of an 
        'inner space' in favour of 'the circumstances of where we are' is surely 
        one kind of attempt to open poetry to something beyond the self. At least 
        we might say that the particular ambition of this poem and Oppen's attendant 
        sense of modernity as a 'being far at sea' are there to remind us of some 
        of the 'fixities' left in our wake as we move from one modernism to another.</font></p>

        Significantly, perhaps, this is Oppen's most forthright comment on Pound's 
        guilt and it is confided to his notebook (see 'The Circumstances: A Selection 
        from George Oppen's Uncollected Writing', ed. Rachel Blau DuPlessis, in 
        <i>Sulfur</i>, 25 (Fall 1989), 22). The fullest and most conflicted response 
        is, arguably, Charles Olson's; see Catherine Seelye, ed., <i>Charles Olson 
        and Ezra Pound</i> (New York: New Directions, 1975). For an extended discussion

        Several contributors to <i>The Objectivist Nexus</i>, make this point. 
        Burton Hatlen, for example, discerns 'some distinctively Jewish overtones 
        in the insistence of the Objectivists that the world is not only real 
        but Other' (45), while Alan Golding comments on 'a shift from the high 
        modernist (&quot;the perfect&quot;) to a postmodernist (&quot;the possible&quot;) 
        poetics of Oppen, and Charles Altieri characterises the Objectivist ideal 
        of 'sincerity' as a demand for 'an eloquence based on the resistance to 
        eloquence' (302) &#150; both moves against the kind of 'self-possession' 
        of which Blanchot speaks. <a href="oppen_nicholls.html#Ref25">&gt;</a><br>

        For analogies to Oppen's way with quotation and citation it is helpful 
        to look to contemporary poets. See, for example, 'An Interview with Michael 
        Palmer', in Thomas Gardner, <i>Regions of Unlikeness: Explaining Contemporary 
        Poetry</i> (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1999), 286: 
        'Occasionally I'll appropriate a source verbatim, but often it will be 
        slightly or radically altered. It becomes altered by the impetus of the 
        poem itself, the demands of the rhythm, the surrounding material, whatever. 
        As so it's not quotation exactly. It's a form of citation, but it's layered, 
        covered over.' <a href="oppen_nicholls.html#Ref41">&gt;</a><br>

        Language, Truth, and Poetry in the Later Writings</i> (New Haven and London: 
        Yale University Press, 1989), 49: 'Poetry lets things go and comes into 
        its own in this event of letting-go. It manifests what is merely present 
        before us or set over against us in the form of representations; it breaks 
        the hold we have on things and allows them to come into their own as beings.'

        Kevin Power, 'An Interview with George and Mary Oppen', <i>Montemora</i>, 
        4 (1978), 220. Oppen's etymology seems slightly awry here. Soli was an 
        ancient Anatolian seaport. According to the <i>Encyclopedia Brittanica</i>, 
        'The bad Greek spoken there gave origin to the term solecism (Greek <i>soloikismos</i>).' 
        The usual derivation of 'solipsism' is from <i>solus</i> and <i>ipse</i>.

        <i>Selected Letters</i>, 118-9: 'Doubt, rather than faith, is the motivation

        approvingly his friend and fellow-poet William Bronk to the effect that 
        'it is by our most drastic failures that we may perhaps catch glimpses 
        of something real, of something which is' (<i>Selected Letters</i>, 167).

        This motif of 'piercing' occurs in several poems. See, in addition to 
        'The Occurrences', <i>NCP</i>, 212, 'Of this all things&#133;', <i>NCP</i>, 
        129 ('everything is pierced/ By her presence'), 'Some San Francisco Poems', 
        <i>NCP</i>, 222 ('Pierced and touched'). Oppen may also have recalled 
        the use of the same word in Simone Weil's <i>Waiting on God</i>, trans. 
        Emma Crawfurd (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1951), 78: 'this nail 
        has pierced a hole through all creation, through the thickness of the 
        screen which separates the soul from God.' Oppen quotes part of the passage 
        about the nail at the beginning of 'Of Hours'. <a href="oppen_nicholls.html#Ref53">&gt;</a><br>

        the distinctive difference of anything is rather the boundary, the limit,

        In the interview with Kevin Power, Oppen seems to suggest that the passage 
        from Weil is the one used as an epigraph for 'Of Hours'. However, it is 
        not clear from the context that he is definitely referring to 'From a 
        Phrase&#133;' here and the passage itself does not connect in any obvious 
        way with the poem in question. <a href="oppen_nicholls.html#Ref61">&gt;</a></font></p>

        The 'jewel' and 'treasure' rejected in the poem's third line seem somehow 
        related to an idea of fetishised or introverted selfhood. Cf. the following 
        comment from the <i>Daybook</i>, which suggests too a damaging delimitation 
        of the erotic impulse (the words appear to be addressed to Oppen's wife): 
        'the Jewel, you thought I was, the warrior, the precious, the vulnerable 
        phallus' ('George Oppen: &quot;The Anthropologist of Myself&quot;', 140)
