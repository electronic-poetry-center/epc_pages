        The Poetry Center at San Francisco State University was a lively and exciting 
        place in the sixties, when I enrolled in the graduate writing program. 
        The finest poets from all over the country came to read and meet with 
        students. I have never forgotten the reading of Charles Reznikoff and 
        George Oppen together. Charles read from <i>By the Waters of Manhattan</i> 
        and George from his just published <i>Of Being Numerous</i>. The clarity, 
        the quiet authority of these two men, the sense of occasion &#150; made 
        that reading more moving than any other I had experienced in San Francisco. 
        I read all their books, and later gave George my first collection when 
        it was published in 1970. It was then that I began my visits to George 
        and Mary on Polk Street </font></p>
        
      <p align ="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
        are not many letters, because mostly we talked over tea &#150; not so 
        much about poets and poetry as about the Oppen's lives, their interests 
        and concerns. I told them about the Israeli poets I had discovered and 
        had begun to translate with the help of native Hebrew speakers &#150; 
        Yehuda Amichai and Abba Kovner, and I showed their work to George. We 
        also spoke about Jewish identity, a troubling subject for both of us, 
        and our feelings about the Holocaust. Of course, I had no idea that I'd 
        be moving to Israel in 1973, and that George and Mary would come to visit 
        Jerusalem two years later! (I wrote about that visit in <a href="oppen_kaufman.html">"Ironwood" 
        #26</a>.) </font></p>
        
      <p align ="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George 
        had and still has a profound influence on my poetry. I had never met a 
        poet whom I admired so much, not only for his poetry, but also for his 
        moral courage, his understanding about fear and hope, and the depth of 
        his questioning. It was his way of <i>being</i>, his way of testing every 
        word and its placement that shaped my own sense of what poetry might be. 
        I met him at a crucial time in my life. </font></p>
