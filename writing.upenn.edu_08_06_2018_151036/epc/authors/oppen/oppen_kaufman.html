        was nothing dreary in the way Mary and George Oppen descended from the 
        airplane in Israel in September 1975. They had been invited by the Mayor 
        of Jerusalem to be his guests at the Mishkenot Sha'ananim, a residence 
        facing the walls of the Old City, for distinguished artists, writers and 
        musicians from abroad. Mary was wearing a bright pink sun hat, and I remember 
        the rosy glow of her face under it, how she held onto the brim of her 
        hat when the wind at the airport almost carried it away.</font></p>

        want to record a fragment of what George experienced during his month 
        with us. Not as a critical scaffold for the poem. Rather a small inquiry

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;One 
        of the things that happened to George in Israel was his meeting with the 
        Hebrew poet Abba Kovner, who had led the Vilna ghetto partisans in their 
        desperate fight against the Nazis during World War II and written a number 
        of poems about the Holocaust, most notably the book-length sequence <i>My 
        Little Sister</i>. In Kovner's poem the sister, a child placed in a Dominican 
        Convent during a winter storm, to save her life while the Jewish community 
        outside the convent is destroyed, becomes an allegorical figure in the 
        end, the sister of all Jews, of all men and women who suffered and perished 
        in the Holocaust.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;We 
        spent the day with the Kovners at their kibbutz; there were other visits 
        in Jerusalem. George and Abba spoke about the War in Europe and the early 
        Communist ideology of Kovner's kibbutz. They communicated with long, warm 
        silences, Abba's halting English, and my husband as interpreter. George 
        read the English translation of <i>My Little Sister</i> and must have 
        recognized how many vivid images Kovner and he shared. Here are the prologue 
        and some lines from the first two sections of that poem:</font></p>

        in this small (that word again!) land since the state was established 
        in 1948. The Oppens were in Jerusalem less than two years after the trauma 
        of the October war of 1973, when morale was still at a very low ebb, "of 
        wars…and storm//of politics…" the Israelis were (are!) also sick. George 
        caught the mood almost immediately.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
        there were also the armies of the western world. In Oppen's poem, disaster 
        is first generalized ("of wars"), and then becomes a deeply moving lament 
        for "clumsy" and "lost" humankind since the beginning of time.</font></p>

        life is never static. There is movement which cannot be interrupted or 
        organized by time. Present and future join with the past so that collective 
        human experience, historical events, Biblical legends are reenacted together 
        in the immediate landscape. There is no linear sequence. Oppen has always 
        arranged his lines accordingly. He shifts and transposes words and the 
        order of words, challenges the illusion of Shelley's "Poets are the unacknowledged 
        legislators of the world" with "legislators//of the unacknowledged world."

        juxtaposes &#151; as he does here<b> &#151; </b> "myself" with "Sarah," 
        so that a third figure emerges, or "young/brother with lost/sister." Who 
        is this young brother? Abraham again? This time at the start of his trek 
        through the desert to claim the land God promised him? Or possibly another 
        dimension: "my young/brother…is my lost/sister." As if the sister &#151; 
        victim of the death camps &#151; her voice still heard by the survivors, 
        has been replaced by a new generation, born after 1948. If not the resurrection 
        of the dead, these young Israelis were (are?) the future hope of a decimated 
        people. "Clumsy" and "alone" but alive! George had a disarmingly romantic 
        view of his encounters with young people here, especially the poets. He 
        seemed to be searching for his own beginnings.</font></p>

        like desert have a powerful and independent life, linking us to what may 
        be remote, even archaic in time, but shockingly near in Jerusalem where 
        the desert is a real place as much a metaphor for a cultural wasteland. 
        Oppen came here as an urban poet &#151; New York, then San Francisco, 
        and summers on an island in Maine. City streets, tall buildings and vast 
        oceans had been his territory. Suddenly there was the desert wind, not 
        the wind of the Atlantic or Pacific, more like the whirlwind of Job. And 
        the sand of the desert, not the beaches of Maine or California.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Disasters" 
        opens a path toward the understanding of that question. The dance &#151; 
        for poets, whether they write in English, Hebrew, or any other tongue 
        &#151; must be in the play of language itself as it advances and withdraws, 
        as it loses and finds its way again, as it travels through pre-history, 
        Biblical history, and into the history of the twentieth century. Oppen 
        created a world out of disparate images from his life and his reading 
        as he encountered them against the very real landscape and ancient walls 
        of Jerusalem. Out of the shook-up sense of his Jewishness. And I believe 
        this precarious, vulnerable, "unacknowledged" world of which he has always 
        written dances with special intensity as it balances on the edge of the 
        Judean desert.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        &quot;journey&quot; George Oppen made in "Disasters" was not only by airplane 
        from San Francisco via Maine and Greece to Jerusalem, but deep into himself. 
        While in Jerusalem he saw "the tent/in the desert" and "the caves/of the 
        hidden people" and the suffering that lonely and confused humans inflict 
        on each other &#151; together with &quot;the five bright elements." The 
        marvel of that. He saw this most clearly and precisely in that month of 
        September 1975 when he wrote "my life/narrows." Feeling the narrowing, 
        he more truly identified with the lives of his historic "family" than 
        ever before. He told us the visit was a "central experience" of his life.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
        began to write the first drafts of "Disasters" half-way through his visit. 
        He worked slowly, painstakingly, shifting the words and lines with great 
        care day after day, before and after his long walks with Mary around the 
        city and up and down the slopes of Mount Zion next to where they were 
        living. It was almost completed by the time he returned to San Francisco. 
        He had heard the "small/voice (of his sister) among the people." It's 
        always small isn't it? As George's voice was also, reading his poetry 
        aloud quietly, tentatively, never insisting. As we should not in interpreting.</font></p>
