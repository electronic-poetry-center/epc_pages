        Robert Graves went off to the Great War with Blake's Songs of Innocence 
        and Experience in his knapsack. F.R.Leavis went with Paradise Lost. David 
        Jones, in a book review of Herbert Read's anthology for soldiers in World 
        War Two, The Knapsack, tells us that he himself went to the trenches with 
        Palgrave's Golden Treasury and another book he doesn't name (one would 
        dearly like to know what it was) in his knapsack. Jones tells us that 
        he sometimes asked himself what the poets knew of death as he witnessed 
        it all around him in the trenches. Literature had nothing to do with the 
        world of the trenches. At least, says Jones, Herbert Read could be trusted 
        with an anthology for soldiers in World War Two since he himself had been 
        a brave soldier in the Great War.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But my example of 
        poetry remembered during a combat situation comes from the Second World 
        War, not from the trenches. It involves two of my literary heroes, the 
        American poets George Oppen and Charles Reznikoff. Oppen was perhaps the 
        most important of the American poets who saw combat in World War Two. 
        His wife Mary, in her autobiography Meaning A Life, writes that he received 
        multiple wounds shortly before VE Day. An 80mm shell had exploded in a 
        hole where he and two other men had taken refuge. Unfortunately they were 
        killed and George lay there wounded for hours, pinned down by German fire. 
        When night fell he managed to crawl away until he was picked up. In 1977 
        he wrote a letter to our mutual friend, the literary critic and scholar 
        Milton Hindus. I shall quote a verbatim extract, which should be pinned 
        to the wall of every serious writer, post-modern or not:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since 1928 or 
        it may have been 1929 when I first encountered Reznikoff's work, I have 
        thought of him as among the truly great, the truly permanent poets &#150; 
        not, of course, 'taking a position' in the manner of Eliot: I mean only 
        to speak of what I have felt, and what has mattered to me.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;(I was with 
        ((tho perhaps not very useful to)) the US infantry in France during the 
        Second World War, and in the final days of that war found myself trapped 
        in a foxhole, slightly injured, and with no apparent means of escape, 
        certainly no possibility until night-fall. I waited, I think, some ten 
        hours, and during those hours Wyatt's little poem &#150; 'they flee from 
        me...', and poem after poem of Rezi's ran thru my mind over and over, 
        these poems seemed to fill all the space around me and I wept and wept. 
        This may not be literary criticism, or perhaps, on the other hand, it 
        is.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This autobiographical 
        story of poetry remembered in extreme circumstances (and yes, Oppen's 
        letter contains literary criticism, sublime literary criticism), joins 
        Jean Am&eacute;ry's memory of the H&ouml;lderlin poem as a case study 
        or at least example of a solitary remembrance (unlike Primo Levi's, Robert 
        Antelme's, Flora Scharf's and Jorge Semprun's) but it differs from Am&eacute;ry's 
        in that Oppen is consoled, rescued. Or is he? Perhaps he is weeping because 
        an intense expression of life has reminded him that survival and a return 
        to his beloved wife and daughter is not certain. Reznikoff's poems filled 
        all the space; we do not know if they filled all the time. The consolations 
        of poetry were bittersweet. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An analysis of the 
        differing situations &#150; socio-political rather than psycho-existential 
        &#150; which Am&eacute;ry and Oppen, both men of the radical left, found 
        themselves in, belongs in another argument, but it would have to touch 
        on Am&eacute;ry's status as a slave labourer and seemingly with no intellectual 
        comrades, whereas Oppen is temporarily unfree in a situation where he 
        can actually fight against the common enemy. In a typical move, Oppen 
        had embedded part of a poem written around 1972-1975, 'Myth of the Blaze', 
        in the letter. And so, not only are Wyatt's and Reznikoff's poetry recalled 
        in the letter, but also his own, which reinforces one's sense of the importance 
        of the original episode for Oppen. Rarely have poetry and literary criticism 
        been so deeply inter-twined.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost 
        to be lost Wyatt's<br>
        lyric and Rezi's<br>
        running through my mind <br>
        in the destroyed (and guilty) Theatre<br>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Varlam Chalamov has implied and Joseph Brodsky has suggested that a man 
        who knows poetry by heart is less likely to be broken than one who does 
        not. In the case of George Oppen, this is undoubtedly true. In the infamous 
        Janowska camp in L'wow, Michel Borwicz, standing next to a companion who 
        was about to give up hope, recited poetry to him. This man too regained 
        his strength and the will to live. Andrej Drawicz and Wiktor Woroszylsky, 
        two Polish writers imprisoned in the early 1980s, revealed later that 
        'A Martial Law Carol' &#150; a poem by Joseph Brodsky a warder pushed 
        under the door of their cell &#150; had meant a great deal to them during 
        their incarceration. But clearly poetry can only be important in extreme 
        situations if you already love it, and love it to the extent of knowing 
        personally important works off by heart, holding them in trust so that 
        the words can be redeemed on demand. </font></p>
