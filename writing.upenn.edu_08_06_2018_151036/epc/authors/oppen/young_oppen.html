      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
        was an overcast afternoon in September 1972. My friend Anthony Rudolf 
        had arranged an outing for George and Mary Oppen. I was invited along 
        as an Oppen acolyte. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
        were perhaps six Oppen acolytes in London at the time (his reading with 
        Robert Duncan at the Central Polytechnic had not yet happened). Otherwise, 
        George Oppen was regarded, if he was regarded at all, as a protege of 
        Ezra Pound recently resurrected by a Pulitzer Prize (and Allen Ginsberg 
        was backing Louis Zukofsky). </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
        xeroxes of Oppen's long poem <i>Of Being Numerous </i>were being passed 
        around. This was mainly amongst a rather withdrawn group of young writers 
        with an interest in poetry which went beyond performance art and public 
        confessions. There was a feeling abroad in timid quarters that poetry 
        was increasingly becoming a dangerous game for stunt-men and -women to 
        play on the high wire of suicide bridges (with a psychiatric ward safety-net 
        for the lucky losers). It was the noon night of R.D. Laing and Zen Zing 
        and Li Po and even Fu I. But the joss-sticks of yesteryear were growing 
        damp, and flower-picking poets were once more looking for lapels and vases 
        in order to free their hands for the grubby but honest business of biro 
        pushing. A return from the Jungian platform to the individual page was 
        on the way. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        was not a mass movement. Still, the more provident young (the six acolytes 
        amongst them) were on the look out for non-dramatic survivors from earlier 
        generations who were not of the received canon. Grandfather figures perhaps, 
        prodigal grand-fathers were due for a return. Pound's favourite sons of 
        the thirties, the American Objectivists were particularly ripe for revival. 
        Zukofsky was around and about, a problematic precedent perhaps. But Rakosi, 
        Reznikoff and George Oppen had kept out of the seamier side of the literary 
        sixties, and were still alive and writing. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
        should be said, the fervent half dozen were not wholly pure of heart and 
        out for poetry merely. The fact that Oppen stopped writing during the 
        thirties Depression and did not start again until McCarthyism exiled him 
        to Mexico, meant more to them than perhaps it should. He was admired as 
        much for his NOT writing as for his writings. I do not think it would 
        be ungenerous to suggest, the acolytes were less impressed by the political 
        reasons (though they were respected) than the creative restraint: young 
        practitioners of the craft find it almost impossible NOT to write. I speak 
        at least for my youthful self in this. What stirred them most, though, 
        was the way Oppen picked up poetry again as though nothing had happened 
        ("Public silence indeed is nothing"). The clear, controlled line of thought 
        and music was resumed, </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are things </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We live among 'and 
        to see them is to know ourselves'...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So spoke the existence 
        of things </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(Of Being Numerous, 
        </i>1967) </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oppen 
        seemed to be telling the acolyte that there is a time for saying and a 
        time for doing, and he had done and said exactly when he should. The supreme 
        arrogance of this statement on art and life bespoke wisdom and judgement 
        and moral assurance. In other words, the six young author/acolytes were 
        in search of <i>character. </i>It was not George Oppen's fault that they 
        found it in him, reading his character rather than his poetry. (At the 
        Poly- technic American Poetry conference in the spring of 1973, Oppen's 
        deep, slow-motion voice spoke for the poetry with moving clarity. One 
        acolyte remembers being chastened. The posse of performing Beats that 
        Robert Duncan brought with him responded respectfully to his simple, dignified 
        and humorous presence.) </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anthony 
        Rudolf planned a singular excursion, a barge trip on the Grand Union Canal. 
        When invited, I questioned its appropriateness. I always regarded the 
        canal as a glorified gutter. I did not tell Anthony this. His answer was 
        characteristically mysterious ("I will tell you another time"). I was 
        glad I had not spoken my mind. Though not because I expected Anthony would 
        ever give me an explanation. Tony was given to deep reasons and I was 
        merely a paddler in them. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Camden 
        Lock was still only in the early stages of gentrification. Dinky little 
        craft-shops had begun to tidy up the courtyard. The place had a self-regarding 
        ambience, an arty enclave for the egalitarian elite. It had not yet been 
        vu1garised into the nouveau Carnaby Street that it is today. On a weekday 
        afternoon in September it was a quiet cloister. George Oppen stood out 
        in the empty courtyard like a Giacometti, a laconic figure, lanky and 
        at ease with the space around him. His wife, Mary, stood by him (their 
        symbiosis was a legend amongst the acolytes) a handsome, busy-looking 
        woman who would have made a fine female warrior. However George, though 
        frail at first sight, did not look as though he needed defending. He had 
        an ironic handshake, testing your grip, and holding back his true strength. 
        Even the most gentlemanly Americans shake hands with a touch of competitiveness. 
        It must have something to do with having to conie to grips with hearty 
        Hemingway types. It is a sensible defence. George though did not appear 
        like a man who needed to prove himself with Morley Callaghan in a boxing 
        ring. But I was a bit bothered that his handshake was not wholly honest 
        (though I understood this, being a hesitant handshaker myself). </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
        suppose I was still fighting this frivolous trip to Little Venice. On 
        one bank of the canal there would be the trapeze-style aviary, and on 
        the other the giraffe yard of London Zoo. The barge would be cramped, 
        guttering through low-lying stagnant waters, and conversation would not 
        have a chance with the engine. After all, I had an annotated copy of <i>Of 
        Being Numerous </i>in my pocket and an idea that it derived from an argument 
        in Kierkegaard (at the time I derived everything I liked from Kierkegaard). 
        It was, I considered, a journey for killing time and conversation. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        pleasure barge, newly painted with circus motifs, was tethered to an antique 
        bollard, recently restored by Camden Lock's bollard devotee. It floated 
        on the murky water of the canal like an outsized sweet-paper, ship-shaped 
        by a monstrously meticulous schoolboy. There was no one around. Anthony 
        stood between the Oppens in his usual dark and heavy suit, and carrying 
        a briefcase (if I remember right). I felt somewhat silly in my jeans, 
        jersey and bohemian slouch hat. I should have been warned it was a formal 
        occasion. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        ticket-boy was found lolling in the prow waiting for customers.. The party 
        mounted the gangway and sat in the barge waiting. Sitting on wooden benches 
        with a flimsy canopy and rain in the air, there was nothing to be said. 
        For a moment I felt that I was a dangerous lunatic brought out for the 
        day by Doctor Oppen, Nurse Oppen and Orderly Rudolf, Nobody else arrived. 
        Eventually the barge manager came around to tell us that there would be 
        no trip. The reason he gave was "insufficient numbers". </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anthony 
        took the party to a teashop across from the Round House. It was the sort 
        of place where Eugene O'Neill might meet George Orwell. Though on closer 
        inspection it could be seen to have gourmet pretentions: it sold Marine 
        Ices. The white plastic-top tables were littered with sugar cubes. The 
        back mirrors reflected the clientele. Mainly single older women with holdalls 
        and lone-wolf ageless, shabby men. In the merciless mirror they looked 
        like permanent waxwork fittings. In fact, the clientele were probably 
        recent refugees from the Enterprise pub next door, just closed for the 
        afternoon. There was also a straggle of truant schoolchildren, and hard-pressed 
        women rocking prams, at the take-away counter ("Marine Ices Save. . :"). 
        Edward Hopper would have lacquered a temporary eternity out of the gloom, 
        repainting it with cruel beauty into an American Icecream Parlour (entitled 
        'Afternoon Vigil '). As it was, the interior darkness merely reflected 
        the grey inconsequence of a drizzling Camden outside, afternoons full 
        of sparrows wings and inner-city purgatories. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        atmosphere was not conducive to table-talk. Still there was conversation, 
        not small talk, rather an exchange of alert courtesies. I do not remember 
        the substance. Kierkegaard certainly was not mentioned. It was conversation 
        with a texture, interweaving with what was going on, and not going on, 
        about us. The cafe was darkening, but too early for lights. The white 
        table tops and the water ices had a glow coming from them. It was all 
        oddly animating. Something was being said. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
        were, in the words of the baby in one of George's poems, "having the life 
        of our times". I was vaguely aware of being drawn with Anthony into an 
        Oppen meditation, </font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Driving 
        home in the rain I found myself completely content. I was a bit puzzled. 
        I had expected an important conversation, with questions answered, and 
        epigrams to remember. All I could recall was that the parting handshake 
        was straightforwardly firm and warm, and I had no hesitation in returning 
        it. In retrospect, I realise what had happened. I had put by my self-consciousness 
        for an hour or two in the company, allowing the world to mull me over 
        for a change. For the duration I ceased to be a callow youth. This was 
        a new experience for me. </font></p>
