              Oppen's "Of Being Numerous" is a poetry of constructive witness:
              the witness 
              of a social becoming that "presses on each" and in which each, 
              all, are impressed.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">Oppen's 
                achievement has little to do with speech or sight, but for 
                speech as sight, 
                site of the social. Not perception but acts of perception, not 
                the given 
                but the encountered, as Oppen suggests in "The Mind's Own 
                Place". 
                Sight in Oppen's work is not a passive looking onto the world 
                but a means 
                of touching that invests the world with particular, 
                site-specific (historical, 
                material) meanings. Without this touching -- tooling, tuning -- 
                the world becomes empty, voided. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">"Near 
                is / Knowledge" [CP 176]. Or, as Holderlin has it in "Patmos", 
                "Near is / And difficult to grasp." Oppen's engendering witness 
                stipulates both the integrity of things seen and their 
                contingency -- 
                "the known and unknown". "Because the known and unknown 
                / Touch, // One witnesses -- " [CP 172]. The intersection of 
                these 
                vectors of response creates the "here" of a "real" 
                we confront, a real which we come to know by participating in 
                its making. 
                ("Here still" [CP 177]). This poetics of participatory, or 
                constructive, 
                presentness -- akin especially to Creeley's -- is Oppen's response
                
                to "the shipwreck / Of the singular" [CP 151]. The "singular" 
                that has been lost is, in one sense, a unitary system of value 
                or knowledge 
                based on reason or theology ("The unearthly bonds / Of the 
                singular" 
                [CP 152]). For Oppen, there is no neo-Nietzschean rejoicing in 
                this loss. 
                Rather, "The absolute singular" is related to what Walter 
                Benjamin 
                has called the Messianic Moment -- out-of-time, out-of-history. 
  "To 
                dream of that beach / For the sake of an instant in the eyes" 
                [CP 152]. 
                For Oppen, however, there is another singularity, the potential 
                for social 
                collectivity: "one must not come to feel that he has a thousand 
                threads 
                in his hands, / He must somehow see the one thing; / This is the
                level 
                of art / There are other levels / But there is no other level of
                art" 
                [CP 168]. "Not truth but each other" [CP 173]. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">Which 
                is to say that, in "Of Being Numerous", the loss of the 
  "transcendental 
                signified" does not necessitate the abandonment, or absence, of 
                knowledge 
                but its location in history, in "people". This view entails 
                both a rejection of the crude materialism of things without 
                history and 
                the crude idealism of history without things. Materials in 
                circumstance, 
                as Oppen puts it [CP 186]: the "actual" realized by the 
                manipulation 
                of materials by human hands, tools. It is this process that is 
                played 
                out in Oppen's poetry by the insistence on the constructedness 
                of syntax: 
                the manipulation of words to create rather than describe. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">"Of 
                Being Numerous" forges a syntax of truthfulness without recourse
                to the 
                grammar of truth -- "that truthfulness / Which illumines speech" 
                [CP 173]. The poem's necessarily precarious project is the 
                articulation of 
                a form that would address the commonweal, a project most fully 
                realized 
                in the two long poems in Of Being Numerous. For Oppen, the 
                demands of 
                the articulation of an ideal communication situation necessitate
                a winnowing 
                of vocabulary and tone that entail the exclusion of anything 
                that would 
                extend, displace, amplify, distort, burst -- indeed, question -- 
                the vocables of an enunciated truthfulness. At his most 
                resonant, Oppen 
                creates a magnificent, prophetic, imaginary language -- less 
                voice 
                than chiseled sounds. His writing evokes not the clamor of the 
                streets 
                nor the windiness of conversation nor the bombast of the 
  "dialogic" 
                but the indwelling possibilities of words to speak starkly and 
                with urgency. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">Yet 
                Oppen's often claimed commitment to clarity, however qualified, 
                annuls 
                a number of possibilities inherent in his technique. He hints at
                this 
                when he writes, "Words cannot be wholly transparent. And that is
                
                the heartlessness of words" [CP 186]. ("Clarity", he has 
                just said, "In the sense of transparence" [CP 162]). In 
                contrast, 
                it is their very intractability that makes for the unconsumable 
                heart 
                (heartiness) of words. Inverting Oppen's criticism that Zukofsky
                used 
                "obscurity in the writing as a tactic" , I would say that Oppen 
                uses clarity as a tactic. That is, at times he tends to fall 
                back onto 
                "clarity" as a self-justifying means of achieving resolution 
                through scenic motifs, statement, or parable in poems that 
                might, given 
                his compositional techniques, outstrip such controlling 
                impulses. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">Oppen's 
                syntax is fashioned on constructive, rather than mimetic, 
                principles. 
                He is quite explicit about this. Carpentry is a recurring image 
                of poem-making. 
                His poems, as he tells it, were created by a sort of collage or 
                cut-up 
                technique involving innumerable substitutions and permutations 
                for every 
                word and line choice. The method here is paratactic, even if 
                often used 
                for hypotactic ends. This tension, which can produce the 
                kinetic, stuttering 
                vibrancy of some of Oppen's most intense poems, is at the heart 
                of his 
                use of the line break as hinge. In contrast to both enjambment 
                and disjunction 
                -- as well, of course, as more conventional static techniques -- 
                Oppen's hinging allows for a measure of intervallic "widths" 
                of connection/disconnection between lines. The typical Oppen 
                hinge is 
                made by starting a line with a preposition, commonly "Of"). 
                At its most riveting, this hinging taps into a horizontally 
                moving synaptic/syntactic 
                energy at the point of line transition. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2"><i>Discrete 
                Series</i> uses this orchestration of lacunae in the most 
                radical and open-ended 
                way. (Could the 25-year gap between <i>Discrete Series </i>and <i>The
                  Materials</i> be Oppen's grandest hinged interval?) In some of 
                the later works, he abandons 
                any angularity in his lineation, at the same time allowing an 
                almost symbolic 
                or allegorical vocabulary ("sea", "children") to take 
                hold. Nonetheless, the possibilities of his use of the line as 
                hinge are 
                omnipresent in the work -- and influential. Indeed, the hinge 
                suggests 
                an interesting way to sort through aspects of Oppen's influence,
                since 
                there is some work that may resemble his but which misses the 
                radical 
                (in the sense of root) nature of his lineation. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                following stanzas 
                were generated using an acrostic procedure (G-E-0-R-G-E 
                O-P-P-E-N) to 
                select lines, in page sequence, from <i>Collected Poems</i>. I 
                have borrowed 
                this procedure from Jackson Mac Low. That these poems are so 
                characteristically 
                Oppenesque is, I think, less the effect of familiar lines or 
                typical references 
                than the way single Oppen lines can be hinged to "each other" 
                to create the marvelous syntactic music found throughout his 
                work. I hope 
                the structural allegory is apparent: the autonomy of the root, 
                of the 
                individual, allowing for the music of the social, the numerous.</font><br>
