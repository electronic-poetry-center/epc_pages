      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are probably many&nbsp;stories to recall&nbsp;about  Paul. He was a colorful guy and liked to hang out with people who  had some color of their own&#8212;more than a little puckish, more than  a little mephistophelean&#8212;especially in the sense that Goethe  referred to that quality: he moved faster than thought. Paul's was  a quicksilver intelligence. It immediately took the impression of  the physical facts of the environment and instantly found emotional  equivalents. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I met him I was recently back from Vietnam and  discovering that I wanted nothing more than to simply write poems.  He was  both a model and an inspiration. His work had an energy  and authenticity I found lacking in many others. Oddly enough, my  other favorite poets at that time, and perhaps still, were Kelly  and Bronk, but also Creeley, Olson and the Black Mountain jrs, like  Dorn and Dawson, as well as Duncan and Leroi Jones and Frank  O'Hara. Paul brought them all together under his wing. He was the  glue that united such disparate voices. In that, he was like a jazz  musician&#8212;the temperament that could include so many under the  respectful shelter of the effort itself.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Cabras</i> and&nbsp;  <i>Bunalbufar, A Brazier...</i> [pages 35 and 43 in The Collected Poems]&nbsp;were early  favorites of mine, in part, because ten years after Paul had returned  from Spain, I fled there after coming back from the South China Sea  and ended living in Soller, Mallorca, not far from where he settled  on that island.&nbsp; Before my first book of poems, Onion, from  Mulch Press, I wanted Paul to write an introduction. He wrote one,  but I wasn't happy with it. I asked him to write another and he  did, but I thought it not splendid enough, although it was a  genuine appreciation of my fledgling efforts. Years later, after he  had died, I sat in my house on the Belizean coast and picked up his  Journals in which I read what became a message to me from the great  beyond: </font></p>
