      <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd like to speak personally of this  extraordinary poet, and take that license insofar as these poems are personal,  often bitterly so. I wonder if any of us have escaped the painful, self-pitying  and meager defenses of person so many of them invoke. What we had hoped might  be, even in inept manner worked to accomplish, has come to nothing&#8212;and whose  fault is that, we ask. Certainly, not mine? Having known both of these dear  people, and myself, I have to feel that there will never be a human answer,  never one human enough.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When Paul Blackburn died in the fall of 1971, all of his company, young  and old, felt a sickening, an impact of blank, grey loss. I don't know what we  hoped for, because the cancer which killed him was already irreversibly  evident&#8212;and he knew it far more literally than we. But his life had finally  come to a heartfelt peace, a wife and son so dear to him, that his death seemed  so bitterly ironic.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Recalling now, it seems we must have first written to one another in the  late forties, at the suggestion of Ezra Pound, then in St. Elizabeth's  Hospital. We shared the same hopes for poetry, the same angers at what we  considered its slack misuses. Paul was without question a far more accomplished  craftsman than I and one day, hopefully, the evidence of his careful readings  of the poems I sent him then will be common information. We finally met at his  place in New York in the late spring of 1951, just prior to my moving with my  family to France. He was the first poet of my generation and commitment I was  to know, and we talked non-stop, literally, for two and a half days. I remember  him showing me his edition of <em>Yeats'  Collected Poems </em>with his extraordinary marginal notes, tracking rhythms,  patterns of sounds, in short the whole tonal construct of the writing. He had  respect then for Auden, which I did not particularly share, just that he could  use him also as an information of this same intensive concern. He was already  well into his study of Provencal poetry, which he'd begun as a student</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">in Wisconsin,  following Pound's direction and, equally, his insistence that we were  responsible for our own education.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As it happened, we shared some roots in New England, Paul having lived  there for a time with his mother's relatives when young. But the Puritanism he  had to suffer was far harsher than what I had known. For example, his  grandmother seems to have been classically repressed (her husband, a railroad  man, was away from home for long periods) and sublimated her tensions by  repeated whippings of Paul. He told me of one such time, when he'd been sent to  the store with the money put in his mitten, on returning he'd stopped out front  and the change, a nickel, somehow slipped out into a snowdrift. And as he  scrabbled with bare hands trying to find it, he realized his grandmother was  watching him from behind the curtains in the front room, then beat him when he  came in. Those bleak Vermont winters and world are rarely present directly in  his poems, but the feelings often are, particularly in his imagination of the  South and the generous permission of an unabashed sensuality. At one point  during his childhood, a new relationship of his mother's took him out of all  the grey bleakness to a veritable tropic isle off the coast of the Carolinas. I  know that his mother, the poet Frances Frost, meant a great deal to him-and  that her own painful vulnerabilities, the alcoholism, the obvious insecurities  of bohemian existence in the Greenwich Village of her time, pervades the  experience of his own sense of himself. His sister's resolution was to become a  nun.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Paul's first marriage was finally a sad shock to me, just that I could  never accept the fact of the person to whom he'd committed himself. She is the  &quot;lady he had known for years&quot; in &quot;The Decisions&quot; and one  hopes she did find the &quot;new life&quot; that cost him so much. The   antagonisms felt by her and my own wife provoked an awful physical battle  between Paul and me one night, when we were all living in Mallorca (he was  about to spend a  year in Toulouse on a Fulbright), and for  some years thereafter we didn't see one another, although we had wit enough,  thankfully, to keep the faith sufficient to let me publish Paul's first books  of poems, <em>The  Dissolving Fabric (1955).</em></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the sixties I was able to see Paul quite frequently, although he  lived in New York and I was usually a very long way away. He and Sara were good  friends to us, providing refuge for our daughter Kirsten on her passages  through the big city, and much else. Sara, characteristically, was able to get  publication for another close friend's writing (Fielding Dawson, <em>An Emotional Memoir of Franz Kline, </em>Pantheon,  1967) thanks to her job with its publisher. Elsewise Paul certainly did drink,  did smoke those Gauloises and Picayunes, did work at exhausting editing and  proofing jobs for Funk &amp; Wagnall's, etc., etc. It's a very real life.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The honor, then, is that one live it. And tell the old-time truth. Of  course there will be human sides to it, but Paul would never argue that one  wins. To make such paradoxic human music of despair is what makes us human to  begin with. Or so one would hope.</font></p>
