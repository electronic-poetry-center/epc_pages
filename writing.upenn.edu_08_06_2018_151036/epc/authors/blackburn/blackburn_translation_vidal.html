      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One canso I've made murderously, <br />
        so much so<br />
        I don't know how I did it. <br />
        Evening, morning, day or night <br />
        I am not master of my thought,<br />
        less of my heart. <br />
        Another time when great <br />
        incertitudes were in the balance-pan, <br />
        there came to me from Love so overwhelming a <br />
        proof of my luck,<br />
        I began to make a canso on the spot. <br />
        It went like that.<br />
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But why keep me in such a confusion?<br />
        She must know that nothing ever pleased me so much.<br />
        From that first hour,<br />
        the first touch,<br />
        I could not split my heart, my love, my mind a<br />
        way from what I'd found. So <br />
        that now if she harms me, it's bound to be<br />
        a disaster for me. <br />
        But if she gives me token<br />
        of accord and friendship, then it's certain <br />
        she couldn't offer greater grace or mercy.<br />
        And if she need a reason to be right, <br />
        let it<br />
        be that her love sustains me.<br />
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      But I don't believe at all in her desire, though <br />
        she speak and smile and make me promises. <br />
        No woman ever lied more agreeably<br />
        or with such cleverness.<br />
        But I can't help believing when she speaks,<br />
      on such peak <br />
      of ecstasy<br />
      her words put me.<br />
        But if she speak truth,<br />
        not France and I the king of all would make<br /> 
        me feel so happy and peaceful. <br />
        But no, she has no heart or good will in the wrangle.<br />
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one ever loved so crazily, <br />
        not even he, <br />
        the squire who died at table. <br />
        I also die <br />
        but she kills more slowly, <br />
        and she knows <br />
        to do it courteously.<br />
        She does not strike with lance or cut with knife<br />
        but with soft words and pleasant-seeming welcome. <br />
        There you have the weapons she fights me with,<br />
        has,<br />
        ever since I've known her, <br />
        and will<br />
        still,<br />
        if she keeps me on.<br />
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete t he inventory of her arsenal <br />
        I can't forget <br />
        beauty, God-given entirely, <br />
        nor has he<br />
        taken one whit from her: <br />
        intelligence, perfect, <br />
        perfectly sincere and always gay. <br />
        I get this way <br />
        because she <br />
        does not permit me her love. <br />
        Yet they say<br />
        one can get fresh water from the sea, which gives me <br />
        hope that genius, say, and mind, and<br />
        the fact that she does not reject me wholly <br />
        will find me Joy someday.<br />
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      Nothing else can quell <br />
      or allay this fire.<br />
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      Lady cure me, don't<br />
        stand and watch me die, a Lazarus,<br />
        of this sweet sickness.<br />
        My running away from it's no good, <br />
        my eyes play tricks.<br />
        When I leave<br />
        I see your beauty before me upon all the roads,<br /> 
      can neither go<br />
      nor go back.<br />
      May I die accursed in hell <br />
      if I had the whole world and lacked<br /> 
      you  <br />
      </font></p>
