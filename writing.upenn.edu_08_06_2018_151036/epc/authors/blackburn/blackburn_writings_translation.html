      <p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. In your view, what is a translator?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A man who brings it <em>all </em>back home. <br />
      In short, a madman.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 2. What special qualifications must a translator have?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He must  be willing (&amp; able) to let another man's life enter his own deeply enough  to become some permanent part of his original author. He should be patient, persistent, slightly schizoid, a hard critic, a  brilliant editor, and have an independent income...</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 3. Is there any rule regarding the choice of  subject matter for a translator? Should the translator stay away from any  given original? Is it important that the  translator be temperamentally close to the original, or the author of the  original?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Stay  away from third-rate work and outright  shit. There's nothing to be gained but money and not much of that. If you  don't love what you read in the original, or admire some major part of it,  forget it. We are all hundreds, maybe thousands of people, potentially or in  fact. Affinities help. Theoretically possible for a man who hates himself, say,  to make a fine translation of someone whose work he <em>hates. </em>Do not think I have ever seen such a translation.  Incompetence or beaky egotism are something else.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 4. Should a translator ever  &quot;improve&quot; on the original? If so, under what circumstances?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> First of  all, it's hardly ever possible. One  is lucky to be able to make an equivalent value. Most &quot;improvements&quot;  prove to be distortions of one variety or another. If the distortion permits a  more perfect Englished version consistent with the diction and style of  the translation, then perhaps, yes. Here we get into matters of taste. Geniuses  ought not to translate, unless they be  truly mad.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 5. To what extent may a  translator introduce variations which his own language permits, but the  original language does not?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To a  reasonable extent, if the distortion of meaning be not too great. Equivalencies  are different in different tongues and different generations. Who's expected to read the final  job?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 6. How  far should a translator attempt to &quot;modernize&quot; an antiquarian piece?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Try first to find a diction, a modern diction which will  translate as many values as possible of the original. I've seen Latin  poetry translated into hip language that works very well for given pieces.  Carried too far, of course, over a whole body of work, it'd be a stunt. Some  stunts, however, are brilliantly executed. It evens out.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 7. What is the  best way for a translator to approach the problem of multiple associations of  word choice? Multiple meanings? (polysemia) </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the double-meaning or an  equivalent is impossible in English, he chooses  whichever single meaning seems most genial to his English text, or strongest to his understanding.  Overtones are constantly being lost. Let him approach polysemia crosseyed,  coin in hand.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 8. Must unit and line length be preserved under all circumstances.? </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No.  You're talking about poetry here. If the  original is interesting for its meaning, translate the meaning. If the meaning  is irrelevant by comparison with the musical values of the piece, translate, as  best possible, what Pound calls &quot;the <em>cantabile  </em>values&quot; But choose, so you know WHAT it is you're doing.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9. What is the difference between free and strict, literal translation? between  free translation and outright adaptation?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Very often readability.  Strict translation usually makes for stiff English, or forced and un-english  rhythms. Outright adaptation is perfectly valid if it makes a good, modern  poem. Occasionally, an adaptation will translate the spirit of the original to  better use than any other method: at other times, it will falsify the  original beyond measure. Much depends upon the translator (also upon the  reader).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10. What frauds have been foisted on the public  recently? (And not so recently?)</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yo no s&eacute;.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 11. Do you experience psychological impediments in  translation? (Blocks, slips, unconscious mistakes?)</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Starting a project is always  difficult; it means rearranging one's whole time to make some continuity (of time and thought) fit. Done slowly  enuf, moving into the author's head should present no problems, if one is ready  for it. The process might make a few problems in one's life, however.  That's part of the dues.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 12. Why do you translate at all? How does it relate to your work? What long and short range effects does it have? What  defects?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Complicated.  I'm interested in the original for  whatever reason. I'm</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">interested  in the language and the processes of language. Pace and time. Take that earlier  answer: yo <em>no </em><i>s&eacute;</i>. It's different in pace and  overtone from <em>no se </em>or I  dunno, or <em>weiss nicht, </em>or <em>sais rien, </em>or <em>non so.<br />
</em>Next question: usually my work will relate to it. It fills  time when my own head is not working at poems regularly. There's an  interaction. The long range effect is  some kind of enrichment of human understanding.  Short range? Everything from giggles to rage to a sense of words whose weight and meaning have changed, are changing. The  sea of language. Defects? Sometimes I can no longer think English. Not sure  that's a defect, tho it must be remedied before the job is delivered.  Alternately: it gives me something else to do, so I don't have to write poems.  But that's true also of my 17-month-old son who has a half-translatable  language of his own, but IS no language,  nor work of artlessness....<br />
      Suppose I liked horses better, or fencing, or were entomophogous?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 13. At the end of his interview  in NYQ issue # 2, Paul Blackburn commented:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I do  enjoy translating, getting into other people's heads. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thass right . . .</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one motivation for  translation. Are there others?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">        There must be ...</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank  you for your time. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quite all right. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
