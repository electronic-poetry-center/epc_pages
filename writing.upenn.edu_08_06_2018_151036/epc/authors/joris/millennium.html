        POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM may well be the poetry
book-of-the-century: a synthesizing and global anthology with an
emphasis on those international and national movements that have tried
to change our ways of making poetry and art as a means  for changing
how we think & act as human beings.
<P>
        This first volume offers three "galleries" of individual poets
-- figures like Mallarme, Stein, Rilke, Tzara, Mayakovsky, Pound,
H.D.,Vallejo, Artaud, Cesaire, and Tsvetayeva--along with a sampling
of the most significant pre-World War II movements in poetry and the
other arts: -- Futurism, Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism,
"Objectivism," Negritude. The second volume will extend the gathering
to the present day, forming a synthesizing and global anthology that
goes beyond any existing twentieth-century collection in its cultural
scope and experimental range.

<blockquote>"The word anthology hardly does justice to Rothenberg and Joris's
brilliant reconceptualization of twentieth-century poetry in a global
context. This is that rare book that forces us to rethink what the
poetic is and can be." -- Marjorie Perloff
<P>
"This book is destined to become a fundamental resource for the study
of twentieth-century literature and culture. Its importance cannot be
overstated." -- Charles Bernstein
<P>
"A riveting literary achievement of phenomenal scope and generosity.
This illuminating compendium displays the best of humanity's bardic
inheritance and vision.... It should be obligatory reading for all
scholars, students, writers, and lovers of poetry." -- Anne Waldman
<P>
"In an accurately titled Poems for the Millennium we can at last sense
the scope of the Revolution of the Word that's been in process
since oh, 1895. There's no other anthology like this one, no other
overview so adventuresome." -- Hugh Kenner
<P>
"Rothenberg and Joris's anthology gives us, by virtue of its organic
structure and inspired choices, the possibility of a kind of situated
internationalism.... It is a sourcebook for the future." -- Gary Snyder
<P>
"This is not like any other anthology, not a collection of
excellences, no absurd imitation of a canon. It's more like a Handbook
of Inventors and Inventions, or of Explorers and Discoveries, that
opens up all sorts of pathways for poetry from its past and future to
a living present... It is above all a book of possibilities and
invitations." -- David Antin
