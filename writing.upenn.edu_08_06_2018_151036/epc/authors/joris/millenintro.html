<h3>1. To pick up at the turning...</h3>

This book began under far different conditions -- in the middle 1980s,
with the reality of the "cold war" and of the "specter of communism"
(K.Marx) still haunting Europe & the world.  These were among the
defining circumstances of our time, and while they continued it seemed
that the twentieth century as we knew it would never end -- that it
would outlast its final decade & that the context of the life from which
our poems arise would remain, largely, the way it was for us.  With the
changes of the 1990s came a strange sense of a return to the century's
beginnings: a time dominated by nationalism and ethnic irredentism,
when totalitarian ideologies were  still in their early stages & science &
technology were on the move towards new & ever faster
transformations.  It was circumstances like these to which  the century's
first modernists were responding politically & artistically.  The
difference then was in their sense that the norms of the culture were --
like its politics -- open to unprecedented changes, which they accepted
exuberantly or from which they recoiled with equal passion.  For most
of those represented in these pages, such changes were centered in the
conditions of their work as poets & artists -- an intuition or prophecy,
as William Blake had said it an the century before, that "poetry fetter'd,
fetters the human race," or, by extension, that poetry set free, can free
or open up the human mind.
<p>
The intention of this gathering is to trace the history of that intuition --
& its attendant poetry -- from <i>then</i> to <i>now</i>. From its
earliest emergence -- out of the eighteenth-century Enlightment & into
the seedbed of a radical Romanticism -- it reflected a tension between
the growth of totalizing nation-states & repeated declarations of the
rights of "man."  In the ensuing conflicts, poets were not only
"unacknowledged legislators" in the ideas they projected (Shelley), but
trans-formers of & through the language in which the work was written.
What began to take shape, then, was the idea of poetry as an instrument
of change -- a change that would take place foremost in the poem itself,
both as a question of language & structure and of a related,
all-connecting vision.  Such a change  -- deepseated, not cosmetic --
was felt to be a virtual reinvention of poetry (or any other art), even (for
some of its practioners) of language itself.  So Tristan Tzara, as
spokesman for postrational Dada, would quote Descartes as an
informing slogan: "I would like to believe there were no other man
before me."  And yet, as we will say again & again in these pages, a
new past was also being fashioned in the process -- many new pasts in
fact.
<p>
The form of the work we have assembled is that is a synthesizing and
global anthology of twentieth-century modernism with an emphasis on
the international & national movements that have tried to change the
direction of poetry & art as a necessary condition for changing the ways
in which we think & act as human beings.  While the first volume of
the anthology runs -- historically -- from the beginnings of modernism
to the middle 1940s, its emphases come largely from concerns of the
later twentieth century as the editors & their contem-poraries have
experienced them. These emphases include:
<ul>
<li> an overall sense that what has characterized the century's poetry
has been an exploration of new forms of language, consciousness, and
social/biological relationships, both by deliberate experimentation in the
present and by reinterpretation of the "entire" human past:
 
<li>  poetry-art intersections, in which conventional boun-daries
between arts break down, sometimes involving generalized art
movements (Futurism, Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus, etc.) led by poets and
with the presence of a poetics at their centers;

<li>  experiments with dream-work and altered  forms of consciousness
(from the outburst of Surrealist dream experiments in the 1920s to the
psychedelic experiments of the 1960s, the meditative experiments of the
1970s & beyond) in which lan-guage itself becomes an instrument of
vision;

<li> a return to a concept of poetry as a performative genre, from
Futurist and Dada soir&eacute;es, sound-poems & simultaneities to the
"new orality" & the expanded performances & textsound works of the
(post)modern (post-World War II) decades;

<li> language experiments, including the sound poetry & text-sound
works mentioned above, as well as experiments with visual and
typographical forms, attempts to develop a non-syntactic (abstract)
poetry, & explorations of new languages & those sub-languages that had
long been at the fringes of accepted literature;

<li> ethnopoetics & related reassessments of the past & of alternative
poetries in the present: a general enlargement of cultural terrains
directed by the sense of an ancient & continuing (subterranean tradition)
with the poetic impulse at its center: a widespread attack on the
dominance in art and life of "high" European culture, leading in the
later part of the century to a proliferation of movements stressing an
explo-ration & expansion of ethnic & gender as well as class identities;

<li>  an ongoing if shifting connection to related political and social
movements "(surrealism at the service of the revolution," etc.) during
what became heroically, sometimes disastrously, an age of ideologies;

<li> an overall sense of excitement & play "(to work in the excitedness
of pure being . . . to get back that intensity into the language" -- G.
Stein) that must be brought across to show the work of the century in
all its color & as the poetry "that might be fantastic life" (R. Duncan).It
has been our hope throughout that we could accomplish all these ends
without turning the selection of authors into the projection of a new
canon of famous names -- rather to have the anthology serve a more
useful function as a mapping of the possibilities that have come down to
us by the century's turning.
</ul>

Finally, it should be clear that we have not been looking for any more
certainty regarding form or content than what the work itself allows us.
In that sense we've welcomed the problematic, even the contradictory,
into the poetry that we've brought together here.  Thus, if an awareness
of the "new," say, seems central to these projects, it is often balanced,
sometimes overbalanced, by an obsession with the old & ancient.  This
represents a problematic & an issue, as do polarities of high & low (in
language, in diction), of symbolism & realism, lyric exuberance &
"objective" precision, hermetic conden-sations & epic expansions,
minimals & maximals, verses & proses, sacreds & seculars, maleness &
femaleness.  While the predilection of the work is to push things to
their limits, even those limits (& that predilection) may be called into
question -- as in the Dada poet's turning on the Dada work: "The true
Dadas are against Dada." Or put another way: at the core of every true
"modernism" is the germ of a "postmodernism."
<p>
<h3>2. Of what makes a history &  what it is ...</h3>

It is the persistence of such issues (political & cultural as much as
formal) that makes a history of the "modern" & the "avant-garde."  For
the better part of two centuries, the Western world & then the world in
general have been witness to a revolution of the word that's
simul-taneously a revolution of the mind & (consistently or not) a
revolution of the (political, material, & social) world itself.  Much of
that is already implicit in nineteenth-century romanticism, but it is
modernism (at least the experimental modernism projected in these
pages) that takes it all the way -- through a sometimes unrestrained
attempt to change both word & thought.  On the simplest level, the
Romantic poet carries along a still traditional, if increasingly shaky,
image of the poem -- its formal structure or poetic "line" -- as in that
side of William Blake that writes
<p>
       Mock on Mock on Voltaire Rousseau
<p>
       Mock on Mock on tis all in vain
<p>
       You throw the sand against the wind
<p>
       And the wind blows it back again
<p>
while the emergent new poet (Blake again) blasts the line apart, casts
off "the bondage of Rhyming" and "Monotonous Cadence," to produce
"a variety in every line, both of cadence & number of syllables." Thus:
<p>
       To cast off Bacon, Locke & Newton from Albions covering
       
       To take off his filthy garments, & clothe him with Imagination
<p>
       To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration
<p>
       That it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of 
Madness
<p>
       Cast on the Inspired, by the tame high finisher of paltry Blots,
<p>
       Indefinite or paltry Rhymes: or paltry Harmonies.
<p>
The difference here is what Rimbaud will later call us to, writing in the
final quarter of the nineteenth century  that "the invention of the
unknown demands new forms" or, again along those lines, "one must be
absolutely modern."
<p>
The story of the modernism that characterized the twentieth century
goes back at least to Blake or to H&oumlaut;lderlin at the start of the
nineteenth -- poets who took traditional verse to its limits & then
stepped across the line into unprecedented "freedom."  With Baude-laire
another key figure, the old verse was more persistent, however much he
was (in Rimbaud's view) the first <i>voyant</i> or "seer" -- also, with
Novalis, say or Edgar Poe in his extraordinary Eureka, an early master
of the (so-called) prose poem--a form that Lautreamont & Rimbaud,
somewhat later, brought to a first fulfillment.  In their positioning
between the old & new, most of the nineteenth-century forerunners
resembled Emily Dickinson, whose recognizable metric was
accom-panied by a revolutionary sense of off- or near-rhyme & by the
use of hyphens/dashes to call her own set rhythms into question.  Only
with Whitman do we see the work turning irreversibly to free or open
rhythms -- equaled, in a sometimes more radical & quirky way, by the
sprung rhythms & soundscapes ("instress") of Gerard Manley Hopkins. 
Often unrecognized, unpublished or scorned in their own time, these
would become the major forerunners of the century ahead.  And with
them as a master innovator was Stephane Mallarm&eacute;, whose
extra-ordinary <i>Coup de d&eacute;s</i> of 1895 both finished the
nineteenth century's fade-out into symbolism & marked the beginning of
the twentieth's relentless transformations. 

<p>
It is with Mallarm&eacute; then that our view as such begins.  In the
works that followed his, barrier after barrier began to crumble, toward
the construction of new forms, the exploration of new behaviors, and
the opening of new possibilities.  Early in the twentieth century this
expressed itself in movements (some tightly organized, some hardly so)
across the arts, as well as in the work of individual poets, acting off a
new permission to write a poetry freshly invented -- reinvented -- in
each succeeding poem.  The first decade of the century was already
filled with this new breed of creative innovator -- in poetry as in the
other arts.  Stein, Apollinaire, Cendrars, Reverdy, Jacob among the
cubists of Paris are obvious examples of poet-experimentalists
interacting with other experimentalists.  This interaction accounts also
for the visual edge in Apollinaire, the verbal edge in Picasso's collages
(always present, heretofore overlooked).  Elsewhere too the push against
boundaries & restrictive definitions of poetry & language can be felt:
Dari&oacute;'s <i>modernismo</i>, Blok's late symbolism, Huidobro's
interaction with the Parisians & self-generated Creationism; the multiple
names (personae, "others") created by Pessoa; Rilke's breakthrough into
angelic visions (prodded in part by the emergence of expressionism &
the rediscovery of H&oumlaut;lderlin as forerunner);  Pound's
declarations favoring a new poetic image (or, later on, the image set in
motion).  

<p>
The movements of those first two decades functioned also as
collaborative <i>vortices</i> (Pound's term), bringing together many
indivi-dualities in a common push toward a new dispensation, aimed at
a drastic change of poem & mind.  Of those movements, Futurism was
both the first & the first to have a poetry & a poetics at its center. 
Based in Italy it was paralleled by Expresionism in Germany, the other
Futurism in Russia & in central Europe, Vorticism in the Anglo world,
the various new -isms coming out of Paris, & a culmination (circa
World War One) in Dada, which was also the first (<i>post</i>modern)
turning against movements & against modernism as such.  The highly
individuated poets working within these movements include Marinetti,
Trakl, Benn, Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky, Pound, & Tzara, along with
boundary-breaking artist-poets such as Arp, Kandinsky, Klee &
Schwitters.

<p>
This energy -- first sighted in a time of war & revolution -- continued
into the century's third decade & beyond,  as typified in what Clayton
Eshleman  has described as the banner year of 1922.  In that year
Europe & America saw the publication of Eliot's <i>Waste Land</i> &
Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, but also Rilke's completed Duino Elegies &
Vallejo's incredibly knotted, thwarted Trilce. It was the decade too of
the birth of Surrealism (1924), led by poets like Breton, Soupault,
Aragon, P&eacute;et, Eluard, Desnos, & culminating in a poet-artist like
Artaud, who turned against it with unprecedented inner violence. In its
central focus on the "dream work" (S. Freud) & in its call for a strategy
of moral & artistic transgression that it only (very) partially began to
realize, Surrealism has colored a major area of post-Surrealist writing. 
At the same time it was countered, largely from the American side (for
which, see the "Objectivists," below), by a push toward a poetry that
would focus on the luminous detail & would allow thereby a
reperception of the here & now -- the familiar world from which
(Charles Olson later wrote) we were the most estranged.  The result --
in Pound, Zukofsky, others -- was to set history alongside myth &
dream as areas of mind & practice to be newly rediscovered.

<p>
Along with the engagement of the Americas (both North & South) other
new modernisms were erupting outside the narrow European nexus (in
Japan & China, say) -- not as a worn-out clash of old & new ("the
ancients & the moderns") but as a demand to be freed from the tyranny
of the canonic past &, increasingly, from that of a degraded present
(including -- in some cases -- a gelled & ism-ed version of modernism
itself.) What all of these modernisms had in common -- at least in the
freshness of their opening stances -- was an urge to decalcify the old
literatures, to strip them of their high cultural gangue & return -- or
advance -- them to a demotic ideal. The immense labors of lifting that
rock were offset by the sheer & actual pleasures of the necessarily
transgressive & liberating moves such work required -- in both the
purely literary & wider social & political arenas. 

<p>
Although the concepts of the artistic & political avant-gardes that were
to mark this century had been thought out & defined in the previous
one, & despite early comminglings or disaffiliations -- Italian Futurism
was immediately politically engaged, while Zurich Dada, in disgust at
WWI, turned away from any such envolvement -- it is from the late
twenties on that the poetic avant-gardes began to link their fate more
closely or publicly with movements of social & cultural liberation, or
tried to forge alliances -- often disastrous -- with both the (political) 
left
& right.  The poets & artists wanted change -- a change that was to
affect not only their art but the world as such. The perceived enemies
were the luke-warm bourgeois pseudo-democracies (the Weimar
Republic in Germany, the Third Republic in France) considered
decadent, ineffective, repressive & opposed to any deep-rooted change. 
The icono-clastic radicalism of the avant-garde would do away with
them at any price, although that price -- especially where art's autonomy
& dream of liberation were all too lightly cast aside -- turned out to be
catastrophic: a choice -- far too often -- between totalitarianisms of the
left & right. When Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, Italian
fascism had already been in place for a decade, Stalin's empire was a
lethal caricature of the revolutionary dream of 1917, while in France left
& right were openly battling in the streets. The choice for the
avant-garde was not always easy, & Georges Bataille, as witness of that
time, speaks of a "fascist temptation" (along with other, likely more
familiar ones) that the avant-garde writers had to contend with -- in, &
around, themselves.  Politically the poets engaged themselves, or were
forced into an engagement with the total state, to which they both
sumitted & offered up resistance.  (Among the murdered in those years
were poets such as Lorca, Desnos, Jacob, Wen Yiduo, Radnoti,
Mandelstam, while other poets such as Hikmet, Akhmatova, Schwitters,
Blaga, Sachs, Neruda, Brecht suffered prison, censorship or exile.) 
While some parts of the social fabric began to alter, the cultural wars in
question were fought on uneven terms, & the suffering (under Hitler,
Stalin) is shared with a greater humanity.  Whatever the accompanying
breakthroughs, their impact on the larger society was still limited &
waited for a later decade to be felt. 

<p>
Or thus, at least, would run a euro-centered narrative of the first part of
this century.  From a wider perspective, however, the de-composition of
the nineteenth-century dream of progress & world-wide power
(European) in the mid-twentieth century cataclysm of war (also,
predominantly, European) marked the beginning of a liberation from the
previous century's still virulent colonialisms. Viewed on such a global
scale, it was now possible to see Negritude -- a surge in the 1930s of
young African & Caribbean writers influenced by Surrealism -- as the
culmi-nating movement of the first half of the twentieth century, with
Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire as certainly its clearly dominant
practitioner.  In that sense, if the chronological division has any validity,
one can consider the post-modern that follows as a developing response
to the decentered/decentering universe of postcolonial reality. Nothing
will be complete, of course, but the openings -- the openness --
prefigured here will define the practice of a growing number of poets
from throughout the world. In the process, the African & Asian masks
looted by nineteenth-century colonialism & which had set ablaze the
imagi-nations of Picasso & Apollinaire, of Tzara & D&eacute;rain in
pre-World War I Paris will also have started their long trek home. 
<p>
<h3>3  A poetics in advance of a poetics</h3>

The history of twentieth-century poetry is as rich & varied as that of the
century's painting & sculpture, its music & theater, but the academic
strategy has been to cover up that richness.  Imagine -- now -- a history
of modern art that left out abstract painting or collage or Cubism or
Surrealism & Dada, & one gets a sense of what the literary histories (in
America for certain) look like to those of us who know that similar
things exist in poetry & that many of the earlier moves & movements --
but Futurism, Dada & Surrealism in particular -- were essentially the
work of poets.  It is this realization in particular that the first of 
our two
volumes is intending to express.

<p>
A characteristic of modern art (& poetry) so defined -- but this carries
into the "postmodern" as well -- has been the questioning of art itself as
a discrete & bounded category.  Some such radical questioning of art &
of its boundaries is what defines our sense of an "avant-garde" & of
some form of "deconstruction" as a strategy for coping with the
inherited (authoritative) past.  (Both of the terms in quotes are
themselves now under question -- the result of two cen-turies of abuse
in the former case, of two decades in the latter; or as David Antin puts
it elsewhere: "When I hear the word deconstruction I reach for my
pillow.") In an essay on Robert Wilson's "theater of images," Robert
Stearns writes (in a configuration we would share with him): "The avant
garde might be characterized as those creators who do not take their
environment & its traditions at face value. They seperate & view its
elements & realign them according to their own needs." 
<p>
This description (while devoid as yet of social/revolutionary purpose) is
general enough to include the great range of strategies & stances in
experimental poetry & art.  Since nothing around us is (ideally) taken
for granted & the conclusion or intention of the work (again, ideally)
arises or emerges from the work itself, the work by definition is
experimental: its outcome unknown, its process crucial.  Such
experiments/redefinitions/reconstructions may work with & on
structures, with ideologies (contexts & contents), with materials &
technologies,  or (in any instance) with & on combinations of all of the
above.  From our shared perspective as poets of a certain place & time,
we see the coming together of these possibilities as still the great
opportunity of art & poetry as these cross into a new millennium. We
would want to go as far as to suggest that the experiments of the
twentieth-century avant-gardes can be viewed as prolegomena to the
realized workings of the century to come.
<p>
While the basis for most of these new poetries has been a drive toward
social -- even spiritual -- transformation, the experiemntal moves  on
their structural & compositional side have involved a range of
procedures that bring out the opaque materiality of language as a
medium as against a "romantic" view of language as purely transparent
window toward an ideal reality beyond itself. These have included
developments (from Mallarm&eacute; & Marinetti on) in visual,
typographic & concrete poetry; in primarily English language
experiments (from Pound & Williams to Charles Olson & beyond) with
"projective verse" & composition-by-field;  in systematic chance
operations (Duchamp & Arp the early prompters, Mac Low & Cage the
leading latterday practitioners); in variations, foremost, of collage &
montage throughout the century.  Along with such quasi-formalist
moves, more strictly  ideological/ideational experiments permeated Dada
& Surrea-lism during & after World War I, Negritude (broadly defined)
by the start of World War II, Beat & Beat-related poetry from the 1950s
& 1960s, Situationist street- & pol-poetics of the 1960s & aspects of
feminism & other liberationist movements over the last two decades. 
Equally extreme but often less recognized experiments involved the
materials & media of poetry -- from the obvious return to poetry as an
art of live performance, to the creation of a new electronic poetry
(soundtext, po&eacute;sie sonore, etc., grounded in its Futurist
beginnings), the rudiments of a computer poetry (leading to
recent/current hypertext & cyberpunk experiments, etc.), & the
beginnings (towards the other end of the technological spectrum) of a
poetry without sound in the culture of the deaf. And along with this
there have been persistent thrusts to raise demotic,colloquial, common
speech as the language of the new poetry & culture.  Taking many
different forms & challenging many longstanding prejudices & language
barriers, this marks a key point at which language experiments &
politics meet.
<p>
This is a much larger field of experiment & change than has been
brought forward in recent controversies about "the death of the author"
or "non-referential writing" & similar textual/intertextual modes of
conceiving writing & the world.  The field is still larger in that the old
rules & basic definitions within each art have  increasingly &
deliberately been set aside or reversed.  The terms -- as we may think of
them now, at this joining point between millennia -- are thick, still thick
with paradox. The imageless (non-representational) art which
characterized the American & European mid-century has been matched
(in deed if not in prominence) by a wordless poetry: the
<i>lautgedichte</i> of Hugo Ball (early)  & Henri Chopin (late).  Other
moves from within language have included those as obvious as the
development of a  free verse (an oxymoron, as William Carlos Williams
taught us) & the parole in libert&agrave; (free words) of Marinetti;
experiments in the prose poem & the aphorism & their questioning of
the boundaries between prose & poetry; nonsyntactic, antisyntactic &
"totally syntactic" poetry from Stein to the Language Poets of the
1980s; & a poetry of elementary forms -- letters & numbers -- that
works with reduced alphabets (Otto Nebel in the 1920s) or extended
ones (Isidore Isou in the 1950s) or invented ones or that reads numbers
as words (Kurt Schwitters) or words as numbers (neo-gematria &
beyond). 
<p>
Similarly, the boundaries between the arts have been dissolving into an
age of blended media ("intermedia") & hybrid forms of poetry & art. 
The distinctions between word & picture, action & text, have broken
down.  Definitions of high & low art have fallen away: the primitive
chant, the pop song have become parts of the poet's arsenal -- new
instruments at our disposal.  The language of everyday speech collides
with or expels the exalted language of an older poetry -- like the art that
seeks to break the boundaries between itself & everyday life, to reenter
the mundane world or to elevate the mundane into art.  At the same
time that some poets reclaim prophetic & visionary functions (the most
expansive claim of all), they or their contem-poraries are altering the
physical nature & location of the poem: new shapes of books (the
Cendrars/ Delaunay <i>Prose of the Trans-Siberian</i> -- a prime
example); new materials to print on (metal, acetate, film & video);
poetry as sculpture in the early works of Kurt Schwitters
(<i>Merzbau</i>, etc.) or the later ones of Ian Hamilton Finlay (for
which, see volume two); the poetry reading & performance, moving
poetry off the page & into the cabaret, the theater, the lecture hall, the
gallery, the coffee shop, the loft, the prison, & the street.  Writes
Michael Davidson of a postmodernism that extends one thrust of the
modern depicted in these pages: "The boundary to what is possible in
writing is a fiction created by & within writing.  Only when the
boundary is recognized as moveable can it become a regenerative
element in art, rather than an obstacle to its growth."
<p>
The twentieth century will be known by its push against the boundaries. 
Where once the definitions were apparent & the frame known, we have
now come into the open, have taken up a stance outside the walls. The
most interesting works of poetry & art are those that question their own
shapes & forms, & by implication the shapes & forms of whatever
preceded them. But it is possible for one to become a master of poetry
(or even a doctor of poetry) & still be ignorant of all this.  (It may even
not be possible to do so without that kind of ignorance)
<p>
It is our intention in this book to bring that much to light.
<p>
<h3>4 A gathering of poems for the millennium...</h3>

We find ourselves, then, at the turning of a new century & a new
millennium.  It is only natural, living where we do, that we should be
seeing a number of assessments and reassessments of those activities
that were associated with "modernism" in our various arts and sciences.
With regard to twentieth-century poetry, a new look has been long
overdue. In the American instance, views of "modern poetry"
established by mid-century have largely continued to the present &, as
they enter the stan-dard anthologies & literary histories, have tended to
play down the more revolutionary aspects of modernism in favor of the
recognition of a handful of "major" figures, many of whom are
celebrated precisely for their anti-experimental & anti-revolutionary
positions or for their ad-herence to a relatively conventional view of
poetic traditions & formal possibilities. This has been the case in spite
of the radicalization of American poetry itself over the last three
decades: a fact that has been treated as a case apart & its continuity
from earlier movements, both European & American, rarely shown.
Although contemporary avant-garde poets recognize the absurdity of
such a position in varying degrees, the shapers of literary history have
rarely used the emphases of more recent or more innovative poets
(projective verse notation, concrete poetry, inter-media & performance,
chance & systems poetry, new experiments with dream & vision,
anti-symbolist strategies, etc.) to reappraise the work of poets from
earlier in the century. Thus the gap between the published picture & the
private exceptions to that picture has continued to grow.

<p>
If that much is the fault of those who remain hostile to the basic
avant-garde gestures, an equally absurd limitation comes from the side
of the avant-garde itself -- in particular from many of us associated with
the so-called "New American Poetry" & its offshoots in the latter part
of the twentieth-century. Coinciding with the 1950s & the pre-Vietnam
notion of an "American century," there has been an apparent rejection of
an international view with regard to the presentation / publication of
contemporary poetry. As a result no general anthology of any
conse-quence has appeared during that period that incorporates both
radical American & European work -- to say nothing of Asian, African,
etc.  (Exceptions to this would be anthologies with specific thematic or
formal focus, most significantly those on concrete poetry &, more
recently, sound poetry, whose significant practitioners are largely, in
fact, European or Latin American.) In addition, we know of no post-60s
anthology that incorporates both the early & later avant-garde on an
international basis, & certainly none that does so with an awareness of
the avant-garde's roots & antecedents, & of its relation to radical social
& political movements at different points in time. 

<p>
By contrast, the present gathering as a whole takes the twentieth century
as its basic time frame, though we begin the century as such with
Mallarm=8E's Coup de D=8Es of 1895 & will end our second volume
in a similar manner -- a few years short of the millennium.  Following
an overture that traces the beginnings of twentieth-century to some of its
forerunners (both poetic & ethno-poetic) in the nineteenth century, our
opening volume is set between the years 1895 & 1945, marked by the
period designation "fin de si&egrave;cle" at its start & by the African &
Caribbean movement "Negritude" (the last great movement of that
golden age of literary movements) towards it end. The movements in
fact make up a major feature of the first volume's contents, with
Negritude preceeded by Futurism (largely Italian & Russian),
Expressionism (largely German), Dada (international), Surrealism
(French & international), & the "objectivists" (largely American). 
Along with these movement sec-tions, we have composed three larger,
loosely chronological "galleries" of individual poets, without a stress on
particular affinities or inter-connections between those represented.  Set
up like pictures at an exhibition, the order of presentation proceeds by
birthdates of the poets, resulting in a number of chance juxtapositions
that resemble a kind of modernist collage.  We conclude the book with
a section called "Origins,":  a brief survey of ethnopoetic & historical
discoveries & sources from different times & cultures, as they have
emerged in both parts of this century, to transform our ideas of poetry
in ways as fundamental as those initiated by our greatest innovators. 
Finally, we have kept the discourse moving by the reprinting of
manifestoes & other documents that are themselves a form of literary
art, even of poetry, & we have added "commentaries" to all the sections
& to all individual poets or poems in the three galleries & the sections
of "forerunners" & "origins."

<p>
A few further things should be said about our selection procedures, all
implicit in the enterprise itself.  Our intention from the start has been to
show a (literal) <i>world</i> of possibilities & to do so within the
confines of a large but necessarily finite work.  As a result we have had
to go beyond a quantitative strategy & to indicate scope or range by the
way in which works are positioned & by what we can say, as
commentators, about their importance now & then.  It should be clear
too that for all our avant-garde emphasis, we have tried not to be
restricted by a superficial avant-gardism but to be flexible enough to
allow the inclusion of all works we feel significantly test the limits of
poetry, both from a structural & from an experiential point of view.  On
its down side, the attempt to be global -- (maximal) in Charles Olson's
1950s formulation -- has meant that we could rarely show the work of
specific poets in depth & that with rare but very deliberate exceptions
we could not present key "long poems" in their entirety.
<p>
The attempt, further, to make a global anthology is itself a challenge to
a whole series of cultural hegemonies & an act of decentering that we
find emerging in modern ism & inching toward fulfillment in the
present ("postmodern") aftermath.  Here again the finite structure of the
book has made it impossible to represent "all" nations & "all" languages
-- assuming we would have the intention or te-merity to do so.  Held
back by a paucity of good translations & by limits on our own abilities
to know & to judge, we havbe again proceeded by acts of commentary
& placement to show how the work of the early twentieth century
begins to encourage new acts of experiment & dis-covery across the
widest range of human cultures.  (An alternative pro-cedure in
constructing an anthology of experimental writings -- to con-centrate on
European & Euro-American modernisms to the exclusion of all others --
would have been to distort what we take to have been, finally, one of
modernism's central issues.) As an indication of the book's openings, we
have taken some particular care to presentn a number of key third world
beginnings & to position Negritude -- along with the "Objectivist" line
of Williams, Pound, & Zukofsky -- as our culminating modern
movement.  In much the same way we have tried to foreground the
work of early women innovators, both known & relatively unknown,
while recognizing the historical & ideological circumstances that
mitiagted against their greater participation in the initial avant-garde
projects.  If we have set the groundwork here, then all of these
directions will be carried to fulfillment in our second volume.
<p>
Yet for all the structuring & inclusiveness on the part of the editors, the
book like all such summaries remains a partial view of what was done. 
We present it with the clear understanding that what has been omitted
may, in other contexts, have as much value & interest as what has been
included.  There are significant areas of twentieth-century poetry that we
have not yet explored sufficiently or that may always be beyond our
abilities to grasp & understand.  And for all of the book's
interna-tionalism, we recognize too that its focus is likely too American,
not because this has been an "American century," but because our own
limitations -- as well as our strengths -- have made America the place
from which our viewing starts.  The reader may accordingly wish to
approach the book, with its divisions into galleries & movements, as the
equivalent of an ample but necessarily delimited museum, with a
display of art that suggests, always, more than it can actually reveal. 
Such an open-ended approach -- our Dada forebears wisely told us -- is
also part of any modernism still worth consideration in the millennium
to come.
