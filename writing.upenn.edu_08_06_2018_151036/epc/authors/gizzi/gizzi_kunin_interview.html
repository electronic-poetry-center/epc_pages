            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In 
              Three Poems, John Ashbery distinguishes between two procedures for 
              determining what goes into a poem: there's the one he's going to 
              follow, &quot;putting all down,&quot; and then there's the &quot;other, 
              truer way&quot; which is &quot;leaving out.&quot; Peter Gizzi has 
              sometimes made poems by subtracting from what's already in the world &#150; and 
              in so doing has proved definitively that erasure can leave behind 
              terribly beautiful evidence &#150; but recently, Gizzi has been more interested 
              in including as much as possible: cultural artifacts, unanswered 
              questions, as well as mistakes, deletions, and false starts. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              In his remarkable new collection, Some Values of Landscape and Weather 
              (Wesleyan University Press), the palate Gizzi uses to depict this 
              surfeit is vivid and strange, and color itself is a transient event, 
              not fully embodied in objects. Human hair can be green, a month 
              can be orange (and &quot;October's crossing-guard orange&quot; is 
              only one of Gizzi's &quot;odd oranges&quot;), and &quot;something/ 
              particular to blue&quot; can happen without being objectified as 
              a surface. This shifting, Technicolor landscape is haunted by textuality: 
              the &quot;wilderness&quot; includes Dante's dark wood and Baudelaire's 
              forest of symbols; the name &quot;Hawthorne&quot; is shared by a 
              &quot;thorny Old World shrub&quot; and a &quot;U.S. novelist and 
              short story writer&quot;; even the bottoms of lakes seem to be lined 
              with books. &quot; 'Here are my flowers,' / What do they smell like? 
              'Paper.' &quot; In order to appear in a poem, a flower has to be 
              converted into paper &#150; especially if it's a flower embedded 
              in a quotation from Jim Jarmusch's film <i>Dead Man</i>.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              Like Jarmusch, Gizzi frequently puts a dead person at the center 
              of his fictions: his &quot;A History of the Lyric&quot; is written 
              under the ominous rubric &quot;Forensics,&quot; and one of the voices 
              of the dead remarks that &quot;every thing is poetry here.&quot; 
              That line is both an acknowledgment that Gizzi's poems are completely 
              written &#150; they do not include any materials that have not been worked 
              over &#150; and an acknowledgment of how much is lost through the conversion 
              of the world into poetry.

              the conditional, allows for generative thought and doubt at the 
              same time. My poem &quot;Chateau If&quot; is a love poem, and it's 
              also a prison: <i>Chateau d'If</i>, in the Marseille Harbor. That 
              poem was a gift, it just came. I was in Provence, the land of troubadour 
              poetry. I wanted to somehow relate or react to that tradition and 
              a prison seemed to be the perfect vehicle, given the conceit of 
              so many sonnets and love poems. I saw the prison, I saw the title.

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              By the way, I am still writing &quot;if&quot; poems &#150; I thought I'd 
              had my fill of the word in my new book but they keep coming. I am 
              taken by the anaphora and the iteration of the repeated questions. 
              I have always used questions in my poetry and at the moment I am 
              just going with it. Though I think repetition should be transformative 
              rather than simply a sound pattern. The repeated words and phrases 
              should build and evolve. I never want the sound to be separated 
              from the emotion carrying the phrase, the purpose of the sound.</font></p>

              Your poems often propose variant readings.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">PG:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              I am fascinated by that. It's almost like a somatic representation 
              of how we stumble and come to order, collect ourselves. I'm allowing 
              the accident to occur, the revision to occur within the poem, because 
              half of what I know I know by accident. I want a poem to tumble 
              down the page. I want the thought to swerve, indicate, and I want 
              it to be open, to indicate something else and something else. I 
              often cut things when I revise to leave the thought moving, just 
              glancing. And the idea of the ending &#150; the final note of the poem 
              should recapitulate but also leave it open. Just like a title behaves 
              to push the thought and have it slide in a further way.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              I just watched <i>The Marriage of Maria Braun</i> for the first 
              time in 15 years. Fassbinder will have a scene that's completely 
              filled with emotion, and the emotion is vexed &#150; it's erotic and angry, 
              it's erotic and fearful, it's greed or it's sorrow &#150; two things 
              playing against each other, always set within a political and historical 
              context. And then he'll cut the scene just before it reaches any 
              resolution, and you come to the next scene, but all of the unresolved 
              feeling of the scene before bleeds into it. It's there as a kind 
              of ghost-image. The tension just keeps building, and that subtext, 
              or maybe the real content of the film, is happening by cutting before 
              it comes to any kind of closure. And I believe that lines of poetry 
              behave in a similar way.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">AK:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              You rarely see montage happen in that Eisensteinian sense &#150; 
              putting two things together to derive some third thing that isn't 
              at all obvious.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">PG:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              I feel, when I'm watching a great film, it behaves the way poems 
              behave. Structurally film is closer to poetry than it is to narrative 
              art. Perhaps it's the compression of time, and that it's so incredibly 
              emotive, and the experience is direct &#150; images, like music, go directly 
              into the body through the neo-cortex &#150; it's a direct transmission. 
              When poems are true, they do that.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              I find O'Hara's veneration of film in his 1959 manifesto &quot;Personism&quot; &#150; &quot;only 
              Whitman and Crane and Williams, of the American poets, are better 
              than the movies&quot; &#150; makes particular sense in relation to Jonathan 
              Rosenbaum's cataloguing of Godard's innovative practices (including 
              &quot;jump cuts, employment of direct sound and interview formats, 
              fractured story lines, references to other films, freewheeling uses 
              of pop culture, and essayistic digressions&quot;). Doesn't this 
              list describe the way poets as disparate as O'Hara, Ashbery, Brathwaite, 
              Spicer, Reznikoff, Marianne Moore, Adrienne Rich, Crane, and Williams, 
              for example, use parataxis, onomatopoeia, ethnographic reportage, 
              narrative disjunction, intertextuality, and pop, sometimes all in 
              a single poem? I think poets are attracted to film because of the 
              flexible quality of the medium, the speed, the scale.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              And William Carlos Williams's &quot;no ideas but in things&quot; 
              is a good place to begin when talking about the nature of images 
              in both poetry and film. I am more interested in &quot;things&quot; 
              than in images. When one composes, an image becomes a thing, an 
              artifact. After all, light is material; sound is sculptural. This 
              is one way to account for the sense of presence one experiences 
              in good film and poetry. Fassbinder quotes Douglas Sirk as saying 
              &quot;you can't make films about something, you can only makes films 
              with something, with people, with light, with flowers, mirrors, 
              with blood, with all these crazy things that make it worthwhile.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">AK:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              In your poem &quot;An Allegory of Doubt,&quot; there's a repeated 
              dialogue tag (&quot;she said&quot;), but it's hard to say whether 
              it's looking ahead to the next lines or back to the previous lines.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">PG:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              That's great when that happens. Then you've caught something alive, 
              in its turn. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              The title &quot;Allegory of Doubt&quot; actually comes from a Giacomo 
              Balla painting, a portrait of his wife from the early 20's after 
              his futurist period. It might be his greatest painting &#150; it depicts 
              an adult woman's face in motion, moving upward, turning up, framed 
              in black. It's absolutely stunning, because it mixes his early allegorical 
              painting with the speed and motion of his futurist work.
              My poem is not really an ekphrastic poem &#150; I mean I'm looking at it, 
              but I'm not writing what's there, I'm writing what happens to me, 
              what I receive, at the moment of looking. I'd like to narrate the 
              experience of reception, not the thing itself. And I think that 
              is the thing itself, finally: what it does to us. Also, how it affects 
              memory. </font></p>

              In &quot;Plain Song,&quot; the title seems to refuse polyvocality. 
              Plain implies monotony &#150; everyone would be saying the same thing. 
              But the poem doesn't seem to be working that way, because it's partitioning 
              speech &#150; &quot;some&quot; are saying this, and &quot;others&quot; 
              are saying that.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">PG:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
              What happened was, I was in France, and I began to lose my English, 
              and my French was not really great, so I was speaking in very simple 
              words constantly in French or in English, so people could understand 
              me. It made me think of Oppen talking about &quot;the little words 
              that I like so much, like tree, hill, and so on.&quot; It's true, 
              they're very effective. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              I think polyvocality is unavoidable. When I write, I write from 
              the sum total of things that have made me: my loves, ideas, people 
              I've known, teachers, the books I've read, the news, the things 
              I've seen. The beauty of thought and/or emotion, the virtue of it, 
              is to be able to present its field, to present the fact that it's 
              actually in relation and living and part of something. If you can 
              voice these things, if they can somehow be hinted at, suggested, 
              or directly come in to speak for a moment and be part of the overall 
              contrapuntal structure of song, then the thought is more comprehensive.</font></p>

              Could we talk about color? Some of the poems seem to be about the 
              actual colors of writing, like &quot;Just a Little Green Untitled,&quot; 
              which, now that I think about it, suggests that the poem has a color 
              but no title.</font></p>

              I'd have to think about it, but it's a lovely idea. It reminds me 
              of Spicer's letter to Duncan when he writes &quot;we need a color 
              wheel for sounds.&quot; I guess I prefer this notion of synaesthesia, 
              which I was working with explicitly in a poem like &quot;Etudes, 
              Evidence, Or a Working Definition of the Sun Gear,&quot; but it 
              performs throughout my work.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              The title of Some Values of Landscape and Weather works in a couple 
              ways. The operative word is &quot;values,&quot; a word of relation 
              as it applies to aesthetics, sound, economics, ethics, institutions. 
              In the title it's plural because I'd like to activate all its various 
              and purposeful meanings. In relation to your color question, in 
              aesthetic values, we're talking about both pictorial coloration 
              and the coloration of the voice in song &#150; pitch, tone, etc. I hear 
              the &quot;some&quot; in the title as an indeterminate quantity as 
              well as the homonym &quot;sum&quot; as in &quot;the sum value of 
              x is x.&quot; And I like the play between the relation of indeterminate 
              quantities and totalities, aesthetics and politics, etc. </font></p>

              In &quot;Etudes,&quot; you say that &quot;Place is constant work.&quot; 
              The poem isn't an aspect of the place; it's the work you're doing, 
              the poem you're writing, the sounds you make, that's creating the 
              place.</font></p>

              I think that's true. The British poet J.H. Prynne once said to me 
              that I have a real penchant for the exclamatory &quot;O.&quot; It's 
              the idea that when the poet enunciates the &quot;O&quot; &#150; the grieving 
              vowel &#150; a world is constituted within the sound. I am equally interested 
              in the doubleness or the exhaustion inherent in archaic poetic gestures. 
              To speak the present as well as the depth of time and tradition.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              Also, I began the &quot;Etudes&quot; poem when I was in Marseille, 
              where the past is always visibly haunting the present: you see a 
              building that begins in the first century, the second floor is from 
              the 13th century, and the third floor is from the 20th century &#150; some 
              incredible piece of architectural genius. Everywhere you look, the 
              Modernist notion of parataxis or collage surrounds you &#150; it's obvious, 
              and just kind of great that way. And, of course, there are always 
              structures being worked on. Wherever you go, there's no vista where 
              there's not some crane or some team of people rebuilding something. 
              People are actually repairing the view.</font></p>

              That's the astonishing thing about poetry, the way the living and 
              the dead are blurred. Poets like Dante or Stevens are just as immediate 
              to me as someone who's writing today. The idea of speaking just 
              next to something, to something that's just gone, or for something 
              that's just gone, doesn't seem that strange to me. Also, I love 
              the way 19th-century American literature accommodates death and 
              mortality; think of Melville, Hawthorne, Dickinson, Emerson, and 
              especially Lincoln. That sense of loss as a wilderness, borderless, 
              everywhere at the periphery. It's part of being here and knowing 
              that we're not here forever. That's why poetry is a lament, and 
              at the same time it doesn't have to be &quot;boo-hoo.&quot; We have 
              so much information technology, and so many ways of capturing and 
              recording and preserving, and yet, still, it doesn't really rescue 
              or save anything. We just know &#150; the technology has let us know &#150; how 
              much has been lost.</font></p>

              A simpler answer would be that I feel dead because everything I 
              believe in seems to have no value in the culture at large. </font></p>

              At a reading, you mentioned the book was originally going to have 
              an epigraph from Scorsese's film Bringing Out the Dead: &quot;There 
              were times when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me.&quot;</font></p>

              It's from the voiceover of the failed paramedic (Nicolas Cage). 
              I thought that was a good way to talk about writing. Writing is 
              a form of rescue, in the sense that you can bring together sensibilities, 
              perspectives, things, nouns, intertextual references to things that 
              are important to you; you can activate a syntax and a vocabulary 
              that will deploy them in some way and give them life. The reason 
              I took it out was because most of these poems were written before 
              September 11, 2001, and it no longer seemed appropriate &#150; I didn't 
              want to draw that much attention to it, or bring it down to that 
              single meaning.</font></p>

              What's being rescued? Are you performing an act of rescue that other 
              people might be watching? Or are you creating a space in which other 
              people might have the experience of rescuing or being rescued?</font></p>

              Both, I guess. I'd like them to have the experience, and understand 
              that that's what they do when they speak, that's what they do when 
              they relate, when they read. I'd like to, somehow enact that. But 
              who or what, that's hard to say. Like in &quot;Revival,&quot; all 
              these book titles and movie titles are coming and going. I remember 
              one person who read it earlier said, &quot;You know, this doesn't 
              make any sense if you don't put the titles in italics or quotation 
              marks. It's gonna look just like a typo.&quot; I don't want it to 
              be in italics or quotation marks; I want it to be a title on its 
              way to being lost.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
              That's the simple version of what's being rescued. A more complicated 
              answer would be: every once in a while I have this experience when 
              I'm writing that when something's completed, when the voice is constituted 
              in a certain way, when the valence is operating at a certain frequency, 
              there's this kind of presence &#150; it's like what I've made, what the 
              poem has allowed for, is a reader. I would like the poems to create 
              some type of threshold of a presence. That's how the lyric behaves, 
              or at least how my poetry behaves. It's like breath on a mirror. 
              It's real. We see it. It's an apparition: it's material.</font></p>

              &quot;A speed and skill beyond me&quot; suggests both a speed that's 
              personal, that belongs to you, and then one that comes from outside 
              you. Another image of speed, almost a condition of vision in your 
              poems, is the car.</font></p>

              I guess it's just a fact of my daily life: I'm an American, had 
              a car all my life, always wanted a car, and we read and see things 
              from the vantage point of the forms we inherit. Things are always 
              in motion, flux, seen at a glance, seen in passing. One manifestation 
              of speed is the fact that what was once called allegory is now something 
              like &quot;air,&quot; it is everywhere, we are constantly witnessing 
              ourselves on TV, in movies, in mirrored windows of storefronts, 
              in magazines and newspapers. We double and multiply. We recognize 
              and regulate and reposition ourselves, endlessly flipping from one 
              source to another. There's no reason to exclude this in favor of 
              some kind of static experience of the world. Why should I posit 
              some kind of thought that's etched in stone?</font></p>
