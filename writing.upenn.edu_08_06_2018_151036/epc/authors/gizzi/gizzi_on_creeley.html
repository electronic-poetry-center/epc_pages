            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Poetry 
              happens for so many reasons. Robert Creeley once said &quot;I seem 
              to be given to work in some intense moment of whatever possibility, 
              and if I manage to gain the articulation necessary in that moment, 
              then happily there is the poem.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It 
              would be hard to overestimate the courage of Robert Creeley, who 
              left Harvard's manicured grounds in his early-20s to become the 
              poet Charles Olson would call &quot;the figure of outward.&quot; 
              Even at their most interior moments, Creeley's poems are concise 
              projections outward of the manifold and vulnerable workings of the 
              human psyche. Olson, 15 years his senior, dedicated his life-work, 
              The Maximus Poems, to Creeley, and in one of his most famous poems, 
              referred to him as the man who gave him &quot;the world,&quot; a 
              tribute to the acts of imagination that Bob made possible through 
              his poems, his belief, and even his conversation. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This 
              spring we lost one of the great believers in poetry and its power 
              to transform life and modes of thought into a more complex, resonant, 
              nuanced reality; a poet who never lost sight of the politics that 
              attend those thoughts and feelings. A poet who found a form to accommodate 
              what Stevens called the violence from within that presses against 
              the violence from without. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Creeley's 
              poems are precise and knowing and have what one of his early books 
              call &quot;the charm.&quot; Each word in a Creeley poem is chosen 
              with such great Yankee economy that it resonates with several possible 
              tones in quick succession-the way &quot;hello&quot; can register 
              anything from surprise to friendship to a call for help, and-in 
              an effect that's pure Creeley-often conveys all these messages at 
              once. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Along 
              with his monumental achievement as a poet, his creative output included 
              over a thousand pages of essays and fiction, a truly unquantifiable 
              volume of letters, as well as the editing of the Divers Press, the 
              Black Mountain Review, various anthologies, and selections of Whitman, 
              Burns, Olson, and Oppen. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 
              facts of Robert Creeley's life should be familiar to readers of 
              the Newsletter. Still, read, if you haven't recently, his amazingly 
              moving, instructive, and hilarious Autobiography. On the web, it's 
              worth checking out the Electronic Poetry Center at Buffalo, where 
              there are links to dozens of poems and sound-files, obituaries and 
              memorials. In fact, Bob was the first poet I knew to embrace the 
              electronic realm. It matched both the breadth and speed of the author 
              of A Quick Graph. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Bob's 
              story was legendary. By the time I read his poems as a teenager 
              he had lost an eye; swum the Charles River; shared a freshman classroom 
              with Hawkes and Ashbery; lived abroad, started a press, and hung 
              out with Blackburn, Dahlberg, Levertov, and Duncan; taught at Black 
              Mountain with Cage, Rauschenberg, and Cunningham, et al.; drank 
              with Kline and Kerouac; fought with Rexroth; typed Ginsberg's Howl; 
              appeared as Lancelot in Spicer's The Holy Grail; had ice-cream at 
              the Zukofsky's; broken bread with Graves, Beckett, Williams, and 
              Pound; and had married three times. His word &quot;company&quot; 
              stood in for all of that and more. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">For 
              poets of my generation, Creeley's international renown has been 
              a fact of life. He never submitted to the view that poetry was only 
              for the few, and he made it possible to imagine that the often obdurate 
              domain of the poem was meant for everyone. His experiments with 
              language extended into a deep and ongoing engagement with the visual 
              arts and music. He collaborated with artists as diverse as Francesco 
              Clemente and Marisol, Joe Brainard and Alex Katz, R.B. Kitaj and 
              Susan Rothenberg, among many others and worked with composers such 
              as Steve Lacy, Steve Swallow, and the group Mercury Rev. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A 
              lot has been said recently about Bob's generosity, which took many 
              forms. He had no tolerance for bullshit or whining but was capable 
              of incredible patience, and if he saw something that was in his 
              power to fix, he did so. And lest we forget, he could be fierce 
              as all get-out. He was a devoted teacher, undeterred by the persistent 
              critique of the role of poets in universities. Conversely, on the 
              Black Mountain model, he was more interested in bending institutions 
              to support poetry. That was one of his labors. Teaching at Buffalo 
              was less Romantic on the surface than driving an ambulance in the 
              Second World War or chicken farming (Bob's first career!) or living 
              on the cheap in Mallorca and writing fiction, as he did in the 50s, 
              or even teaching at Black Mountain. But it was no less bold a gesture 
              and speaks to the persistence of his self-determination. He made 
              that harsh northern clime thrive for nearly 40 years, eventually 
              bringing in Susan Howe and Charles Bernstein. He and his beloved 
              Penelope made their home a locating center for generations of poets. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">He 
              loved other poets. I mean, the whole enterprise of being a poet, 
              including its public obligations. Mario Cuomo appointed him the 
              first New York State Poet Laureate, an office he delighted in. But 
              with Bob, prizes were never what the conversation was about, so 
              you could be his friend without realizing he was awarded the Frost 
              Medal, the Shelley Memorial Award and-for his collection Life and 
              Death, written while he was in his 70s-the Bollingen Prize. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">While 
              his work is now a fact of American letters, part of what's beautiful 
              about Bob's life in poetry is its restless energy, the way he let 
              patterns return. Echoes, mirrors, and windows are all reflective, 
              unstable media, ephemeral as the body. The means by which we see, 
              or hear, ourselves as others. What is ephemeral is, in some sense, 
              always new. I remember opening Windows in 1990. Its first section, 
              &quot;The Company&quot;(originally published as a chapbook from 
              Burning Deck) begins with the poem &quot;Song.&quot; So windows 
              opened not to a view but to a sound, not an answer but a question. 
              Bob was in his 60s and seemed to have found a place from which it 
              was possible to begin everything again:</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">What's 
              in the body you've forgotten<br>
              and that you've left alone<br>
              and that you don't want-</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">or 
              what's in the body that you want<br>
              and would die for-<br>
              and think it's all of it-</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">if 
              life's a form to be forgotten<br>
              once you've gone and no regrets,<br>
              no one left in what you were-</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">That 
              empty place is all there is,<br>
              and/if the face's remembered,<br>
              or dog barks, cat's to be fed.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Maybe 
              it's a rhetorical question, maybe not. But like so much of Bob's 
              engagement with the world, the line is transformed by a genuine 
              curiosity and an ability to face the nothingness always teetering 
              just off the page. The most unimaginative of reviewers called Creeley's 
              poems solipsistic and self-involved-and that was what they risked, 
              the accusation of being too personal. But for Bob, the body was 
              at the core of public understanding, a common experience that linked 
              us all, far beyond the dividing lines of ideological, psychological, 
              or aesthetic affinities. If he took the world personally, what else 
              was there to do? </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">One 
              of the great experiences a poet can have in adult life is genuine 
              admiration for a fellow poet. Bob was unabashed in acknowledging 
              his own elders, and that fact of his personality only served to 
              fuel and clarify his own work. He was a bridge between the moderns 
              and the present, devoted not to usurping them but taking the whole 
              scene as one. He was always passing it on. The point was never to 
              be alone there. He was intense, a powerful and improvisational presence 
              in the lives of so many poets working in the field for the past 
              60 some years. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Robert 
              Creeley was a genius of his art. This original and beautiful man, 
              husband, father, teacher, was a true and honest friend to many of 
              us and was, as he would say, the best of company. His poems are 
              a continuing inspiration for us to persist both in the poem and 
              in the world. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As 
              Creeley wrote in a late letter to Williams, &quot;bless you for 
              being clear to all that a world can mean.&quot;</font></p>
