            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Currently 
              on the Faculty of the Department of English at the University of 
              Massachusetts-Amherst, Peter Gizzi has published a number of books, 
              including the recent <i>Some Values of Landscape and Weather</i>, 
              from Wesleyan University Press, <i>Artificial Heart</i>, <i>Periplum</i> 
              and other poems, and others. He's also the editor of Jack Spicer's 
              lectures, and is currently working with Kevin Killian on the collected 
              works of Jack Spicer, a four-volume project.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Peter 
              is often described as one of the most important poets of his generation. 
              People have written about Peter's qualities as a poet, his &quot;reinvention 
              of the lyric,&quot; &quot;his visionary quest and raw emotion,&quot; 
              his management of a myriad of details available only in the hyper-extended 
              age of the post-industrial, post-punk and post-L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E. 
              I'd like to describe something else, something related to his work 
              as an editor, organizer, an activist for poetry.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In 
              the foreword to the final double issue of o&#149;blek, the one collecting 
              writing from the now infamous gathering of &quot;emerging writers&quot; 
              known as Writing From the New Coast held in 1993 in Buffalo, Peter 
              describes the generational significance of Earth photos taken from 
              space. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;We 
              are the generation of artists that grew up with a photograph of 
              the earth tacked to our walls. When that first image of the earth 
              was sent back in 1959 our conception of this place was changed materially. 
              No longer was it to be a world so defined by our ancestors; in that 
              swift shutter and instant transmission it became worlds, peoples, 
              and languages. All boundaries or clear definitions of identity are 
              eroded, active and blurred. Simone Weil said &quot;You could not 
              be born at a better period than the present, when we have lost everything.&quot; 
              We live in this space of multiplicity where the ability to construct 
              a single world with shared aspirations, sensitivities and imagination 
              is not only improbable but impossible. Yet it is poetry's function 
              to aspire to the impossible, because poetry works through a human 
              agency &#150; the generosity of a reader and a writer. Poetry demands 
              that a risk be taken, and from this act of intelligence courage 
              claims precedence over poverty of spirit.&quot; (o&#149;blek, 1993)</font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">At 
              the time I found that statement remarkable. Its epic scope shocked 
              and excited me. I was energized, indeed activated as a poet to be 
              an editor, a publisher, a poetic maker in the broadest sense. Here 
              was a call for a poetics of risk, significant for a generation emerging 
              from the Reagan 80s &#150; he had cheerful optimism about how such 
              groupings, in our case a gaggle of graduate students, could muster 
              sufficient hubris to declare themselves the government. The risk 
              of not doing so is found in the warning supplied by George Oppen's 
              &quot;Of Being Numerous,&quot; which Peter cites in the following 
              section of the Foreword to that last issue of o&#149;blek:</font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">How 
              shall one know a generation, a new generation?<br>
              Not by the dew on them! Where the earth is most torn<br>
              And the wounds untended and the voices confused,<br>
              There is the head of the moving column<br>
              Who if they cannot find<br>
              Their generation<br>
              Wither in the infirmaries<br>
              And supply depots, supplying<br>
              Irrelevant objects.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In 
              Peter's case, the body politic that emerges under his care as &quot;program 
              director&quot; or &quot;professor&quot; or &quot;editor&quot; is 
              generous enough to make the opening in the field porous and democratic, 
              and the objects supplied have been renewed with a life force that's 
              keepin' it real, vital, relevant. This is partly why you'll see 
              a trail of literary magazines and small poetry presses run by his 
              students from Buffalo, Santa Cruz, and now U-Mass.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Looking 
              back at his meditation on the photo of the Earth &#150; written nearly 
              a generation ago &#150; and from the vantage informed by all that 
              has happened in the interim &#150; I see the importance of the proximate 
              in Peter's work. This proximity is a layered adjacency  &#150;  as much 
              a remix of physical human spaces and encampments (New York School, 
              San Francisco Renaissance, Language Poetry, etc.) as it is a temporal, 
              a hieratic association with poetic ancestors. Peter sings to the 
              lived-in world from the vantage of all-time, drawing on the riches 
              of a variety of poetic traditions, and with as much filial piety 
              as youthful irreverence.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It 
              is a fractured brilliance, not broken but from rescued shards assembled. 
              This sophisticated blending of informants and influences is delivered 
              with a seeming spontaneity that should make the workshop regulars 
              blush.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Though 
              it's difficult to choose something &quot;characteristic&quot; to 
              sample here, and thankfully so, take this from the poem &quot;At 
              Earth&quot; found in <i>Artificial Hear</i>t:</font></p>
            <p align="justify"> </p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This 
              earth came into being without a name; without a link,<br>
              Men disappear.<br>
              Without words, the word is undone by silence; and becoming<br>
              multiple, is without reception.<br>
              Becoming without reception, dispossession was taken away,<br>
              but not to those without linkage.<br>
              Someone died, being wind, the allegorical aspect of wind, and<br>
              of the fortune of life, without silence, a blind counselor.<br>
