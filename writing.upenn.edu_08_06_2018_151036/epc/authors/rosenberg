My pieces for simultaneous voices date mostly from 1972 to 1974. All of
this work sprang from a day that changed my life. I had arranged to visit
David Bromige at his house in Sebastopol, California. (At the time I was
living in Berkeley.) When I got there, I found a house overflowing with
the voices of poets: David played tape after tape. It was a transforming
experience. Of course I had been to many readings by that time, but had
never thought to get a tape recorder and collect tapes. Returning back
to Berkeley I knew I would have to begin this. Shortly after getting a
tape recorder, as an experiment I tried overlaying several layers of some
material I had written earlier using chance operations. What I heard was
a strange kind of pulsing prosody, almost like syllable prosody, but at
a much much longer wavelength. I knew two things when I heard this: that
I didn't understand this prosody at all, and that I would have to make
several tape pieces to find out about it. Thus began the body of work which
has thankfully been rescued and preserved here.
<p>The textual material that was used to make these pieces is roughly of
two types. Some of the texts were written using formal chance procedures
that involved extracting found material. It turned out that I was using
almost identical procedures to those discovered more than a decade earlier
by Jackson Mac Low (e.g. works in <i>Stanzas for Iris Lezak</i>.) Other
texts were simply written "by hand", but with the benefit of the experience
of formal chance operations, and using almost a kind of "mental precomposition
and extraction" process that is hard to explain. (I recall Jackson being
amazed that the phrases in <i>Intermittence</i> were written without using
formal procedures.)
<p>The methods of combining the voices into clusters likewise consist of
both rigorous formal procedures and a much more informal approach. I have
notebooks of catalogs of overlay structures, and for some of the pieces
used chance operations based on such criteria as density to choose overlay
types from an exhaustive listing of all the possible patterns. I tended
to think of these patterns as being somewhat like types of foot, but with
the scale vastly expanded, so that a whole phrase would play the role of
a single syllable. In other cases much more informal methods were used
to combine the voices. Actual documentation of dates and precise composition
methods for these pieces does not exist, and these works were made so long
ago that I don't always have a clear memory of just how I made them.
<p>The earliest work is <i>Dawn Quartet</i>. As recorded this is a "bi-linear"
piece: the left channel and right channel consist of exactly the same text,
but the lines of one channel are read in the reverse order of the lines
in the other channel. The lines are notated as being either voiced, whispered
or completely silent. The <i>Home Made Emphasis</i> pieces and <i>Completing
The Square</i> form a series. The title <i>Home Made Emphasis</i> reflects
an acute awareness on my part that I was using consumer tape equipment
that was not up to "radio standards". Still, as I play these pieces back
through low-cost PC speakers, there is an odd kind of rightness to that.
I have no clear memory of how <i>Home Made Emphasis #2</i> was made; I
recall 1 and 3 being made by using tape loops to control the precise offset
of the voices in each cluster, according to a procedural compositional
scheme. (It appears my records of this are not complete, alas ...) <i>Completing
The Square</i> is the last of the series, and I believe it was mixed at
Radio KPFA in Berkeley and completed in 1973. There would have been no
way to have arranged enough studio time to have used the tape loop method,
so as I recall I recorded a large amount of material and extracted clusters
based on resemblance to an overlay that came out of a procedural scheme.
<i>Intermittence</i>
was first performed (1974, I think) at the San Francisco Poetry Center.
The recording here was made at WBAI in New York in 1975; the readers were
Barbara Barracks, Jackson Mac Low, Sharon Matlin, and Mac McCloud. The
score for this piece was published in <i>Scores: An Anthology of New Music</i>
edited by Roger Johnson, Schirmer Books, New York, 1981. The score gives
the timing and the overlay structure; each reader receives 7 pages of 3
stanzas each and orders them however the reader would like; some pages
are given to only one reader, some to two, and some to three. Thus each
performance is likely to be unique. <i>The Pheasant Glides Upon Landing</i>
is constructed from a hand-drawn Diagram Poem. I had no memory of ever
having made a tape piece from one of my diagrams, and was quite surprised
to encounter the diagram in an old notebook, clearly notated as a text
for a tape piece. My tape composition notebook is full of notations from
the making of this piece, which I can't decipher even as I look at them.
The diagram is notated as 10/74, so the tape piece probably dates to some
time in 1975.
<p>In 1974 I described this work as follows:
<blockquote>By these overlays at times no words whatever can be made out.
What is left may be described as 100% prosody. While I very much love the
sounds that result from these overlays as sounds, my main interest lies
in the area of using the occurrence of words whose meaning has been "nullified"
to reflect on the language process in the full range of its contexts, including
semantics. That is, by hearing speech elements where the words cannot be
made out, the ears are tuned differently than they normally would be for
hearing words where the meaning can be made out.</blockquote>
There are many people I need to thank for making the appearance of these
pieces at The Electronic Poetry Center possible. As I mentioned above,
it was David Bromige who originally launched me on this journey. Charles
Amirkhanian provided studio time at KPFA, encouragement, and broadcast
some of these works. Loss Peque&ntilde;o Glazier, to whom we are all indebted
for creating The Electronic Poetry Center, arranged for my old tapes to
be dubbed off onto DAT. Steve Bradley generously donated his time at the
music studio of SUNY Buffalo to dub the tapes. Martin Spinelli transformed
the DAT tapes into Real Audio and brought them to the world.
<p>Most of all, anyone will hear at once that the spirit of John Cage looms
large in these works. At the time that John died, a phrase came to me that
I and some others I know found useful:
<blockquote>John Cage: not in memoriam, but in use: in <i>continuous</i>
use</blockquote>
May we all keep using ...
