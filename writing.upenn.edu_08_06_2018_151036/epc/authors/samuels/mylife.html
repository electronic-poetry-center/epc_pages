<h2>Eight justifications for canonizing Lyn Hejinian's <i>My Life</i></h2>
<h4><br>
<p>	In the past few years, the second edition of <i>My Life</i> (Sun &
Moon Press, 1987) has become a clear candidate for academic canonization.
With this process underway, it is worth investigating why Hejinian's
autography is so popular, so likable.  (I use the word "autography"<a
href="mylife.html#1">1</a> because this is the story of a languaged self, a written
"I," rather than the autobiography of an experiencing human.)  Why is
<i>My Life</i> taught, apparently as
an exemplar of contemporary experimental poetry, in so many American
colleges and high schools?  More considerably, why might it be
<i>perceived to be worthy</i>, a palatable "postmodern" work?  This second
version of the question is perhaps preferable, since Hejinian's work is
hardly a national bestseller: reprinted for the sixth time in 1996, it had
sold at that point something over 8,000 copies.  Still, such a figure
makes it considerably more successful than most other non-mainstream
poetic writings. </p>
<p>	The abundant attention to <i>My Life</i> in small prestigious
journals like <i>Temblor</i>,  and brief mention in a number of critical
books, joins increasing comment in more mainstream academic journals:
<i>Contemporary Literature</i> has had two articles on the work in the
last four years, and <i>American Literature</i> recently published one.
Increased mass gains gravity, of course, but critical attention to
Hejinian's book is not simply a function of previous attention.  This book
accesses a number of categories for pleasure and familiarity, both
literary and cultural. </p>
<p>	Perhaps the most obvious category for <i>My Life</i> is American
autobiography.  So I want to begin by quoting perhaps the most obvious
example of that genre, Benjamin Franklin's <i>Autobiography</i>, addressed
as a letter to his son: </p></h4>
<blockquote>	
Now imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the <br>
Circumstances of <i>my</i> Life, . . . and expecting a Week's <br>
uninterrupted Leisure in my present Country Retirement, I sit<br> 
to write them down for you.  To which I have besides some other <br>
Inducements.  Having emerg'd from the Poverty and Obscurity in <br>
which I was born and bred, to a State of Affluence and some <br> 
Degree of Reputation in the World, and having gone so far thro'<br> 
Life with a considerable Share of Felicity, the contracting Means <br> 
I made use of, which, with the Blessing of God, so well succeeded, <br> 
my Posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them <br> 
suitable to their own Situations, and therefore fit to be imitated. 
</blockquote><h4>  
<p>As the linguistic version of a prosperous and happy American life,
<i>My
Life</i> is a descendent of Franklin's hopeful perfectionisms.  The very
first section indicates that "Leisure," "Affluence," and "Felicity"
characterize both Franklin and Hejinian: "I was in a room with the
particulars of which a later nostalgia might be formed, an indulged
childhood" (8).  Praise for this work makes perfect sense in a culture
which likes poetry to mesh personal experience (autobiography) with
language play, and life stories to be edifying (when they are not, that
is, more or less prurient cautionary tales).  What follows is an
interconnected array of categories for the popularity of My Life: these
are intended to be suggestive, applicable beyond the explorations carried
out here. </p> 

<p><h3>1. Understandability</h3></p>
<p>	In rough terms, Hejinian's creative writing divides into two
modes.  On one hand, works such as <i>Writing Is An Aid To Memory</i>
(1978) and <i>The Cell</i> (1992) are quite linguistically and poetically
complex.  On the other, <i>My Life</i>, and some of her other work,
presumes a broad-ranging understandability.  From the naive free-spirited
play of her first book, <i>the gRReat adventure</i> (1973),<a
href="mylife.html#2">2</a> to the hopeful
and only vaguely political passages in her collaborative work in
<i>Leningrad</i> (1991), she often writes with a simplicity people don't
generally call to mind when they think of "postmodern poetry." As evidence
from <i>My Life</i> suggests, Hejinian operates in this mode--writing for
understanding--quite consciously.  Consider an excerpt from her essay "If
Written is Writing" (published in 1978, the year she wrote the first
edition of <i>My Life</i>):</p></h4> 
<blockquote>
The text is anterior to the composition, though the <br>
composition be interior to the text.  Such candor is <br>
occasionally flirtatious, as candor nearly always so. <br> 
When it is trustworthy, love accompanies the lover, <br> 
and the centric writers reveal their loyalty, a bodily <br>
loyalty. . . .  Marvelous are the dimensions and therefore <br> 
marvelling is understandable -- and often understanding. <br> 
(rpt. in <i>The Language Book</i> 29)<br> </blockquote>
<h4><p>As with many of Hejinian's comments on writing, this passage
profits from further explanation.  But its terms are those of
understanding: the process of writing ("the composition") intercourses
with the product of
writing ("the text"), "love" (the words) keeps company with "the lover"
(the writer), and the interpenetrating "dimensions" exist in a
comprehensible ("understandable") state.  Process, product, the "bodily"
writer, all combine to produce a marvel of comprehension.  Arguably, this
description indicates the complexity the "centric" writer must endure in
order to produce understandable writing.  The crucial point, though, is
that the resulting product is clear.    In this accessible mode, Hejinian
conceives of herself as a centric writer, loyal and clear-minded, and in
this mode she has produced a handful of books. </p>
<p>	In latter years, though, Hejinian has not facilitated access to
some of her most understandable writing.  In 1994, for example, Sun & Moon
Press issued <i>The Cold of Poetry</i>, which reprints most of her
hard-to-find earlier works.  It leaves out, however, three early works
which are arguably her most accessible: <i>the gRReat adventure</i>, <i>A
Thought is the Bride of What Thinking</i> (Tuumba Press, 1976), and <i>A
Mask of Motion</i> (Burning Deck, 1977).  These three works are now pretty
well confined to rare books rooms.  So despite some darkening and
complexifying of <i>My Life</i> in its second version (a pattern I shall
return to), it remains the one most understandable work of hers which is
readily available.  How interesting that it is the one the academy most
attends. </p> 
<p>	Predictable events and language are fundamental to the
understandability of <i>My Life</i>.  It has been pointed out <a
href="mylife.html#3">3</a> that
Hejinian represents an all-American girlhood; but most of the book's
events are more those of the <i>expected surface</i> of a privileged
American childhood in the prosperous 1950s.  So far so good, born in 1941,
and educated at Harvard, as Hejinian was.  We go from cars to kitchens to
parks to books, in scenes of childhood and adulthood, and unexpected
particulars are generally overmastered by predictable events. </p>
<p>	The understandability of the language is not quite as predictable.
Marjorie Perloff calls this a celebration of "language we all recognize"
(225).  Such a claim of course depends on a certain definition of the
"we": Hejinian's educated English conveys the sense that more impenetrable 
language is always to hand but never used.  Consider these lines from
section 37: </p></h4>
<blockquote>
A sense of definition (different from that of description,<br> 
which is a kind of storytelling or recounting, numerical, <br>
a list of colors) develops as one's sense of possibility, <br>
of the range of what one might do or experience, closes <br>
with the years. So I gave it away.  I can only offer the <br>
apologies I have committed.  When we first moved in, the <br>
neighbors on the left complained about the saxophone, but <br>
eventually, as we became familiar, they began to feel well <br>
disposed towards us, friendly, until the noise was what <br>
they liked most about us, since it proved them tolerant <br>
and generous.  Planes of information intersect, coincide.<br>
(90)</blockquote>
<h4><p>In the terms of this passage, Hejinian gives away definition in
favor of
description.<a href="mylife.html#4">4</a>  This preference for description is 
underscored by the fact
that the last three sentences of this passage were inserted in the second
edition, as if to clarify and illustrate the original.  Words, events, and
the poetics of the work itself are described.  Perception of description,
not interpretation of definition, becomes the reader's task.  Telling
description is a matter of intersecting and coinciding, rather than
defining, information.<a href="mylife.html#5">5</a> </p>
<p>	The danger of calling this "language we all recognize," or pieces
of an all-American girlhood-grown-to-womanhood, is that the book's
accessibility risks being seen as generic, fully identified either with
known language or known cultural habits.  That is, as definition.  What
blocks such definition, in the passage above, is a mixture of the language
we really might all recognize--neighbors and noise--with other language
that only a particular segment of the population will attend to: about
subtleties of definition, description, and planes of information.  But
even these subtleties are avowedly not complex because they are not
"defined."  Again, defining is associated with what "closes," with what
the speaker has given away. </p>
<p>	Such guidance systems (frequent self-explanations and simple
diction) preserve the non-specialized nature of this work.  It does not
swim in private enigmas, it teaches us how to read it--as Wordsworth said
good poetry should do--and it is consistent in its self-presentation.
Above all else, perhaps, it is not terribly difficult in vocabulary or
ideation.  Hejinian's descriptive understandability makes a world of
accessible verbal grace.  This is by no means a criticism.  It is meant to
describe a "postmodern" writing that never turns away from possibilities
of understandable meaning. </p>

<p><h3>2. Motivated Proceduralism</h3> </p>
<p>	The consistent self-presentation begins at the structural level of
<i>My Life</i>.  Joseph Conte identifies two distinctive postmodern
poetic
forms, the serial and the procedural (3, 13-44).  In first and second
editions, <i>My Life</i> fits the pattern of proceduralism, with its
untraditional (unprecedented) predetermined method of 37 (then 45)
sections, with 37 (then 45) sentences each.  It is also, based on
Hejinian's 37 (then 45) years of age, a perfectly personal form.  Her
proceduralism is thus at least doubly <i>motivated</i>--by the personal
and the literary--in a kind of arithmetics of autobiography.  Compare, for
example, Ron Silliman's use of the Fibonacci number series as the
procedural determinant of <i>Tjanting</i>.  Silliman's chosen grid has an
arbitrary relation to the literary; it appears random, however
deliberately chosen.<a href="mylife.html#6">6</a>  Hejinian's method, because its
artifice is not
inexplicable or (apparently) perverse, might well be more palatable to
teaching and critical worlds in search of reasons, and wary, or weary, of
the postmodern arbitrary. </p>  
<p>	Her method also evinces a kind of internal organic form, further
linking the personal and the literary.  We might call it a crystalline
organicism, thinking of something like Clark Coolidge's <i>The Crystal
Text</i> and of Hejinian's claim, in a second edition sentence, that "One
could base a model for form on a crystal or the lungs" (48).  This
postmodern organicism is not the psychological variety of Romanticism,
arising out of and seeking to inscribe a real-world moment.  Nor is it the
linguistic organicism of a modernist like Wallace Stevens, whose poems
thread lyricism out from itself in a linear fashion.  Hejinian's organic
form can be invaded and grown out at any point, as it is in the second
edition, in which she adds eight new sentences to each previous section
and eight new sections to the whole.  Again, we have the stability of a
traceable form (growing "organically" from the subject) balanced with the
experimentalism of a new variety of form.<a href="mylife.html#7">7</a> </p>
<p>	Another detail which enhances the personalized literariness of
Hejinian's procedure is the literary pedigree of the headnotes, the
repeated poetic phrases which signal each section.  Though used in an
innovative way, these echo a tradition of elaborated headnotes stretching
from medieval rubrics of forecasting to the marginalia in the late version
of Coleridge's <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>--or better yet, the
headnotes to the chapters in his <i>Biographia Literaria</i>.<a
href="mylife.html#8">8</a>. Some of
Hejinian's headnote phrases are beautifully "imprecise": for example,
"<i>What is the meaning hung from that depend</i>" (16) "<i>Preliminaries
consist of such eternity</i>" (95).  But the majority are clear and
simple, calling out phrases that continue to resonate: "<i>I laugh as if
my pots were clean</i>" (78); "<i>The greatest thrill was to be the one to
tell</i>" (65).  The headnotes, then, are in the position of clarifiers,
and in a tradition of authority and guidance.  They make an innovation of
tradition, a personalized use of recognizable form.  Their slanted
guidance functions something like song choruses, identifying and
re-inscribing their songs.  And as one of the book's many repeated phrases
has it, "the obvious analogy is with music."<a href="mylife.html#9">9</a> </p>
<p>	These procedural graces combine to make the literary scholar and
teacher feel at home, linked to the literary past and given stylistic
footholds into the postmodern, which looks less chaotic (than, say, Susan
Howe's <i>The Nonconformist's Memorial</i>) in the light of <i>My
Life</i>.  </p>

<p><h3>3. Prose Poetry = Sincere Complexity</h3></p>
<p>	Prose is our culture's language of sincerity, in which we expect
to be most able to say what we mean and see what is meant, to be
understood and to understand.  The place of message.  Poetry is our
culture's language of complexity, idiosyncratic sensibility, the language
of artifice. </p> 	
<p>Prose poetry, then, might afford the best
opportunity for sincere surface play, for deep artifice, a joining of the
power of prose clarity with poetic complexity.  This is the model of prose
poetry in <i>My Life</i>.  And while it is surely a model filtered through
Silliman's speculations about the prose poem in <i>The New Sentence</i>
(Roof Books, 1977), it differs sharply from the difficult <i>amalgam</i>
of poetry and prose that characterizes a writer like Gertrude Stein.
Hejinian makes prose and poetry coexist but not melt into each other,<a
href="mylife.html#10">10</a> in
what she calls "A healthy dialectic between poetry and prose" (64).
Compare, briefly, sentences from Stein's portrait of "Matisse" with an
excerpt from <i>My Life</i>.  First, Stein's words: "Very many did come to
know it of him that he was clearly expressing what he was expressing.  He
was a great one.  Any one might come to know that of him.  Very many did
come to know that of him. . . . Very many were wanting to be doing what he
was doing were not wanting to be expressing anything being struggling"
(330-31).  Now, an excerpt from <i>My Life</i>: </p></h4>
<blockquote>	
It was at this time, I think, that I became interested in <br>
science.  Is that a basis for descriptive sincerity.  I am <br>
a shard, signifying isolation -- here I am thinking aloud <br>
of my affinity for the separate fragment taken under scrutiny.<br>
Yet that was only a coincidence.  The penny disk, the rarer <br>
dollar disk.  Her hair is the color of a brass bedstead.  (52) 
</blockquote>
<h4><p>For all their affective simplicity, Stein's sentences are vastly
artificial.  They foreground wordplay and make precise meanings nearly
invisible, emptied of immediacy into absolute ways of saying and knowing,
for example "not wanting to be expressing anything being struggling."  In
Hejinian's lines, there is no such sustained instability of the sentence.
We hear complete sentences, shards of sentences, and explanations of why
"separate fragments" are "taken under scrutiny" (again, here, the second
and third sentences are second-edition interpolations that clarify the
passage's subject).  We get, that is, both the pleasing complexity of
poetic discontinuity and rhythm and the guiding clarity of prose's
"descriptive sincerity." </p>
<p>	The compact between poetry and prose operates in diction as well
as in syntax.  If poetry is meant to be the language of the unexpected,
where juxtapositions enliven language, much of this book's
"poetry"--idioms, clichés, and so on--reveals and emphasizes the "poetry"
of the everyday, the poetics of the ordinary, the poetry of prose.  The
following passage, for example, mixes self-explanation with "ordinary"
sentences which are themselves moved by subtle poetic sounds and
connectives: "This autobiography of expansive sensations is divided
horizontally.  Mrs. Butterworth isn't racial.  I was pregnant and needed a
rocker.  There was a moving crowd of crows loud above the swaying trees.
The T-shirts hanging from the line flapped like plump birds along the
shore" (61).  Hejinian is celebrating, by extension, the poetry of all
language, and such celebration is consoling to language users.  Bruce
Andrews, by way of contrast, refuses those kinds of consolation. </p>
<p>	Hejinian does express some discomfort about prose comforts,
claiming in <i>My Life</i> that "Proses is props" (62), and in "The
Composition of the Cell," "64.1 When I get nervous I'm narrative" (<i>Cold
of Poetry</i> 117).  But the prose grounding of <i>My Life</i> is never
abandoned.  She is using prose as a mode of understandability, to guide
the book.  Such clues as "This autobiography of expansive sensations is
divided horizontally" are not like the postmodern meta-commentary of a
writer like Italo Calvino, steering us from uncertainty to greater
uncertainty.  The poetized prose of <i>My Life</i> might compare,
paradoxically, to Hejinian's description of Stein's literary vision (in
<i>Temblor</i> 3): "She saw things in a present continuity, a present
relativity, across the porous planes of the writing."  The mix of prose
and poetry in <i>My Life</i> matches such paradoxes--presence and
ongoingness, presence and comparability, a plane which is also full of
holes--to sustain a particular balance of real and ideal.  As Hejinian
writes in a later section, "It is precisely a special way of writing that
requires realism.  This will keep me truthful and do me good. . . . Of
course I want things to be real! . . .  Minute discriminations release
poetic rather than cerebral effects" (101).  If prose is the language of
the real world, Hejinian riddles it with poetry to celebrate,
simultaneously, the idealization of reality which is languaging and the
"minute discriminations" in languaging which make for poetry. </p>

<p><h3>4. Inhabitability </h3></p>

<p>	The diction of prose poetry is one detail of the way <i>My
Life</i> represents "real life" as a translation into ideal life,
imaginable and inhabitable by many language-transfixed Americans.  Such an
ideal life has to do with the happiness project (of which more in a
moment) and almost has to be characterized by occurences which are not too
singular or idiosyncratic.  Sure enough, as Hejinian puts it, "<i>The
years pass, years in which, I take it, events were not lacking</i>" (69).
Prosaic event is translated into poetic ideal, as this passage shows:
</p></h4>
<blockquote>
The sudden brief early morning breeze, the first <br>
indication of a day's palpability, stays high in <br>
the trees, while flashing silver and green the <br>
leaves flutter, a bird sweeps from one branch to <br>
another, the indistinct shadows lift off the crumpled<br>
weeds, smoke rises from the gravel quarry--all this<br>
is metonymy.  The 'argument' is the plot, proved by<br>
the book.  Going forward and coming back later.  Even <br>
posterity, alas, will know Sears. (59) </blockquote>
<h4><p>What kind of day?  What kind of trees?  What kind of birds or
weeds?
Which Sears in which town?  The lack of specialized detail makes these
spaces and memories languaging Americans might all inhabit. </p>
<p>	As we might also inhabit the very "I" of the book.  In
autobiography, the I of memory is of course not the I remembering.  This
obvious separation of one I from another is multiplied exponentially in
Hejinian's work.<a href="mylife.html#11">11</a>  To consider the difference between
idiosyncratic
autobiography and the way Hejinian idealizes or linguistically
reconstructs this life report, compare a passage from 1976 (from <i>A
Thought is the Bride of What Thinking</i>, unpaginated) with what we might
call the autographic translation in <i>My Life</i>.  First, the earlier
passage: </p></h4>
<blockquote>
What is possibly my earliest recollection is of a <br>
brilliantly yellow flower sharp on the grass. From <br>
that period also come other purely visual memories.<br>  
I remember clearly particular wallpapers, the small <br>
yellow roses on the yellowing paper in my grandmother's <br>
room, the faded green stems and leaves, and the dark <br>
green paper of my own bedroom.  In still another room <br>
was a pink paper, newly hung, which I tore off the wall <br>
in long strips as I lay in my crib for an afternoon nap. <br> 
Because my memory is visual in its nature, that I should <br> 
have become a painter follows logically. Yet, though my <br>
father was a painter, I am not. </blockquote>
<h4><p>And the start of <i>My Life</i>: </p></h4>
<blockquote>
	<i>A pause, a 
rose,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A moment yellow, just as four years <br>
	<i>something on
paper</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
later, when my father returned home <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the war, the moment of greeting <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
him, as he stood at the bottom of the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
stairs, younger, thinner than when he <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
had left, was purple -- though <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
moments are no longer so colored. <br>
Somewhere, in the background, rooms share a patterns of small <br>
roses. Pretty is as pretty does.  In certain families, the meaning <br>
of necessity is at one with the sentiment of pre-necessity. The <br>
better things were gathered in a pen.
</blockquote>
<h4><p>In the first passage, autobiography charts specified childhood
places and
experiences.  In the second, autography intermingles common cultural
history with the writing that gathers it in a pen, that tells an
inhabitable story.  The text not only enacts this relinquishment of the
stable "I," it invites it: a yearning for a flexible, linguistic, even
de-gendered "I" pervades the work.  In her essay "The Rejection of
Closure," Hejinian claims that language is ungendered: "the desire that is
stirred by language seems to be located more interestingly within
language, and hence it is androgynous" (<i>Writing/Talks</i> 283).  Not
only androgynous, but even disembodied.  As Hejinian wrote later, "I
myself feel that the physical body is astoundingly alien -- as if I had
the amazing possibility of being intimate with my own otherness, which is
an animal" (<i>Aerial #5</i>, 33). </p>
<p>	Hejinian's focus on androgyny and bodilessness in language may
explain why subjectivity becomes a loosened force in <i>My Life</i>.  The
work always has a narrating "I," but it is isolated, neutered, questioned,
as these excerpts indicate: "And if I feel like a book, a person on paper,
I will continue.  What is the gender on paper" (76); "Pronouns skirt the
subject" (77).  Nor does the "I" necessarily progress or sequentially
develop.  This nonlinear self-telling is intensified in the second
edition, in which each section has grown by eight randomly inserted
sentences, further destabilizing any sense that the "I" might be located
and progressively tracked.  One appeal of this "I" is the suggestion that
anyone can wear it, one "I" fits all.  This inhabitable I, by the way, is
unlike the concern with obviating the "I" that many see as a critical
project of Language poetry.  If word focus and phrasal repetition make
<i>My Life</i> a Language text, its I-centeredness does not. </p>
<p>	In addition to refusing Language poetry's excision of the "I,"
Hejinian's subjectively motivated proceduralism rejects classical
modernism's preoccupation with so-called "objectivity."  Hejinian's
subjectivity recalls the personal (and uncanonized) modernism of a poet
like Parker Tyler.  In his long poem <i>The Granite Butterfly</i> (1945),
Tyler speaks from the heart of a subjective sensibility which produces
neither impenetrable self-confessions nor a refusal of shared humanity:
"Some poets . . . have admired the obstacles that fixed literary forms
place in the path of a creative artist, and feel that in surmounting these
one may reach the highest art.  But art itself is never the question.  It
is only the artist that matters, his personality and his fate, which are
linked indissolubly with his time."  Though this focus on the human is not
what Hejinian usually preaches in her essays on writing, it is what her
writing itself often enacts, and most keenly in <i>My Life</i>. </p>

<p><h3>5. The Happiness Project</h3> </p>
<p>	Given the genre context of <i>My Life</i>, it is instructive to
compare it to the earliest autobiography of a woman, <i>The Book of
Margery Kempe</i>.  This is a medieval story of spiritual ecstasy and
misery which Margery recounts to a priest.  The most striking difference
between the two works is the absence of any extremity at all--but
particularly of pain and suffering--in Hejinian's autography.  It contains
neither grappling with evil nor even any real resistance to circumstances.
The author lives in language and sees that it is good.  This is a portrait
of the artist as fulfilled and confident: "After any visit to a museum,"
the book asserts, "at home I impulsively haul out my paints and never
expect disappointment" (97).  Sometimes Hejinian sounds like a trusting
child of Ben Franklin: "I will not despair; my hope is 1) to rise daily
before seven, 5) to avoid idleness.  There cannot be ups without downs"
(98).  But Hejinian's is not a self-improvement project; there is no sense
of inadequacy or undeservingness here.  Even what might be a worthy
question--"Am I a kind, a good person." (81)--is formed as a statement,
not a question.  Its relation to a truly questing "I" is undercut by its
phrasal flatness. </p>
<p>	Happiness, the book seems to say, is a blessing that has been
worked for and bequeathed as a gift to the child.  This legacy is
strikingly evident at the end of the second edition, with her
grandfather's observations on the unnecessity of happiness.  It is as
though this is a story of Americans who make good emotionally on the backs
of their less happy progenitors: "happiness is worthless, my grandfather
assured me when he was very old, he had never sought it for himself or for
my father, it had nothing to do with whether or not a life is good" (115).
</p> 
<p>	Not to say that Hejinian is unaware of what she calls the
"constructedness" of her project.  "The trend of my theory," she writes in
a second edition sentence, "may sometimes run utopianward in reality"
(100). </p>

<p><h3>6. The Absence of Evil </h3></p>
<p>	The decision to efface difficult moments makes this a document of
the daylight hours of life, devoid of sex, violence, tragedy, and even any
particular sorrow.  Even in an apparent reference to someone's (presumably
her father's) death by cancer, the emotive referent is obscured by the
verbal sea it swims in: "It was cancer but we couldn't say that.  A name
trimmed with colored ribbons.  It was a warning that ‘things will go our
way' no longer.  Snakes cannot roll like hoops and bees do not definitely
suck their young wholly formed from flowers" (69).  This is a moment when
the deliberate constructedness of the happiness project is thrown into
relief. </p>
<p>	Two things seem to be going on here.  The first is that language
is not life and therefore can be made to tell stories as one likes it to.
The second is that Hejinian does not like to ponder wickedness.  If
language can enable the self to lose gender and other fundamental
attributes, language can cause all things to appear beautiful.  Because it
is not experience, language is never horrible.  Living in
language--poetizing one's life--removes the powers of horror from
experience.  There is no fucking or shitting here, no Kathy Ackerisms.
Not even Carla Harryman masturbating on the phone, as she does in <i>there
Never was a Rose without a thorn</i> "I want to come before the collector
gets off the phone.  I look at the nude, her slatted body, her pillarlike
knee, the tough looking genital area.  But not her face which I choose to
avoid as I come into my hand" (12). </p>
<p>	Hejinian has coauthored a piece with Harryman: called <i>The Wide
Road</i>, it is often erotic and charged with otherness.  In one of a
series of letters they exchanged about this collaboration, Hejinian
expresses bafflement about evil, about the "trauma" that is so dominant
elsewhere in the "postmodern" art world (thinking again of Acker, or of
the violating photographs of Cindy Sherman).  In response to Harryman's
query, Hejinian writes: </p></h4>
<blockquote>
And so I arrive at violence and an aspect of the <br>
eroticism that Bataille addresses and about which <br>
I feel, at the very least, trepidation and a degree <br>
of unfamiliarity. . . . I don't know how to think about <br> 
this -- about torture for example.  Violence in this <br>
sense disrupts and destroys the integrity of the other's <br>
self.  This is so repugnant to think about that I -- I <br>
guess I have to reject it altogether.  (<i>Aerial #5</i>, 30) 
</blockquote>
<h4><p>This is a wonderful angelicism, perhaps anticipated by something
Hejinian
wrote in 1976, in a Transcendental and Wordsworthian moment.  Even in
spite of itself, in spite of its freedom from morality, art will serve
human uplift, <i>plaire et instruire</i>: "Most often, in fact, the work
[of art] itself maintains ethical neutrality.  (However, it's [sic] effect
is usually beneficial, in that great Art serves as great Nature does, to
both elevate and humble the observer.  This is its effect, but not its
purpose.)" (<i>A Thought is the Bride of What Thinking</i>). </p>
<p>	It is worth keeping in mind, if we teach <i>My Life</i> as an
avatar of 1980s poetic postmodernism, that it keeps on the sunny side.
Hejinian's additions in the second edition, however, are almost
programmatically darker and more complex than the contents of the first
edition.  I don't want to overstate this change, but it is traceable and
often pronounced.  One example in the fifth section will serve to make the
point.  Added sentences are in brackets: </p></h4>
<blockquote>
A glass snail was set among real camellias in a glass <br>
bowl upon the table. [Pure duration, a compound plenum <br>
in which nothing is repeated.] Photographed in a blue <br>
pinafore. [The way Dorothy Wordsworth often, I think, <br>
went out to 'get' a sight. But language is restless.] <br>
They say there has been too much roughhousing.  (17) 
</blockquote>
<h4><p>Here both diction and literary/historical allusion make the second
edition's language and approach more adult, if you will.  In this same
section, a sentence is added about the death of a child who had fallen
down a well-fitting, "in which he was wedged, recorded, and died" (16).
Not every addition so clearly serves to make the work more complex; but
most do. </p>

<p><h3>7. Wordsworthian Romanticism </h3></p>
<p>	The complexifying of language and event in the second edition of
<i>My Life</i> rescue it from a perhaps excessively Wordsworthian
idealism, as though in a fit of penitential realism Wordsworth might have
gone back to <i>The Prelude</i> and devoted some lines to Annette Vallon
(see Jerome McGann's essay, in this issue, for more on Wordsworth's
exclusion of negative and morally questionable life events from <i>The
Prelude</i>).  Certainly, when Hejinian writes of "The pre-life of an
individual" (73), asserting that "I am a stranger to the little girl I
was, and more -- more strange" (75), it is difficult for the literary
reader to avoid thinking of Wordsworth.  Like Wordsworth ("trailing clouds
of glory . . . From God, who is our home"), Hejinian is aware of her
benevolent origin and upbringing.  And like Wordsworth, Hejinian
constructs her life story for its happiness benefits. </p>
<p>	The famous Wordsworthian "spots of time" are also paralleled in
<i>My Life</i>, but as reinscriptions of language rather than
recollections of needed moments of grace.  Unlike Hejinian's, Wordworth's
program of benevolence is grounded in loss and suffering, what he calls
"the ministry of fear."  Further, Wordsworthian "spots of time" are
fundamentally objective, even divine, moments that later and repeatedly
serve a healing function for the troubled psyche.  His poetry is a report
and an enactment of this benevolent scheme. </p>
<p>	Hejinian's might be better called "spots of language," personal
experiences as linguistic encounters.  If Wordsworth brought words to
explain the significance of his spots of time, Hejinian's spots of time
are always word-bound.  This verbal memory is most obviously inscribed in
the repeated phrases that echo throughout the book and serve their turns
as headnotes: "<i>We have come a long way from what we actually felt</i>,"
"<i>The plow makes trough enough</i>," "<i>One begins as a student but
becomes a friend of clouds</i>," "<i>Yet we insist that life is full of
happy chance</i>."  But the entire scene of memory in <i>My Life</i> is
word-bound.  Language makes the event what it is and also, later, makes
the event conjurable and acceptable.  Instead of Wordsworth's two
consciousnesses, the "then" and "now" of being (see <i>The Prelude</i>
Book II, 27-33), Hejinian's focus is on language, the "thens" and "nows"
of words.  Consider an excerpt from both first and second editions:
</p></h4>
<blockquote>
The coffee drinkers answered ecstatically, pounding <br>
their cups on the table.  How to separate people from <br>
principles. A healthy dialectic between poetry and prose. <br>
Good days go by fast, too fast. On the low rectangular <br>
coffee table was a rack for the postcard collection. <br>
A lot of questions, a few answers, the progress of <br>
questioning, the spot on the brain where these words will <br>
go. For example, I remember the blue coat with the red <br> 
piping but I don't remember myself in it.  (64) </blockquote>
<h4><p>Here we return to spots of language visited before ("A healthy
dialectic
between poetry and prose," "The coffee drinkers answered ecstatically").
These spots serve as linguistic touchstones for the introduction of new
memory material, and for the very consideration of how memory might work,
which "spot on the brain" holds the words of experience.  At the phonemic
level, too, language drives the memory.  In the parallels of "coffee
drinkers . . . pounding cups," "people from principles" and "poetry and
prose," we hear words connecting and driving memory experiences.  Words
act like the memory object of "the blue coat with the red piping," which
operates to put the memory in descriptive clothes but not to elicit the "I
. . . in it." </p>
<p>	Another Wordsworthian resonance comes in the potentially
continuous additive structure of the book.  It serves as a kind of
<i>Prelude</i> that can be written and re-written as the author ages and
wants to alter her material, since additions come in the middle of the
work, in its revisability, rather than only at the end.  To write a work
which can be grown out, in the manner of the crystalline organicism I
suggested earlier, is to inscribe into the work both presence and absence.
That is, the fact that eight sentences, not present in 1980, can
materialize in each section in 1987, suggests that many more sentences not
in appearance do potentially exist.  (Something in the way that there are
sad stories not told in this happiness project.)  The sentence becomes the
amplifying building block, at the same time self-sufficient and a
microcosm of all other already-present or potential sentences: "To some
extent, each sentence has to be the whole story" (67).  As the work
declares, "We never wanted more than something beginning worth continuing
which remained unended" (71). </p>

<p><h3>8. The Consolation of Poetry</h3></p>
<p>	<i>My Life</i> argues that language is enough.  The
Wittgensteinian inheritance--the limits of my language are the limits of
my world, language is itself the vehicle of thought--is written as an
inheritance not of loss but of sufficiency.  As Hejinian wrote in 1978,
"we [are] obsessed with our own lives, which lives being now language, the
emphasis has moved.  The emphasis is persistently centric, so that where
once one sought a vocabulary for ideas, now one seeks ideas for
vocabularies" (<i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> 29).   We relinquish ourselves to
the representative government of language, and language does not
disappoint us: it shapes our world and gives it back to us. </p>
<p>	We have come a long way from what Augustine felt.  What he saw as
the inadequacy of language to tell of the human becomes in <i>My Life</i>
the adequacy of what is, the happiness project, joining the adequacy of
what is told.  As Hejinian wrote in her essay "Language and Realism,"
"things take place inside the writing, are perceived there, not elsewhere,
outside it.  It is the nature of meaning to be intrinsic, in other words,
immanent, as the meaning of any person is, of me, is me, the person.  That
is how a poem means."  The writing, that is, tells itself, includes within
it all the necessary elements of its meaning.  Such pure sufficiency makes
poetry even more than Wordsworth's "abundant recompense": it aspires to a
complete consolation. </p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p><a name="1">1</a>.  "Autography" is a term apparently gaining in
currency, as evidenced for example by Jeanne Perreault's use of it in
<i>Writing Selves. Contemporary Feminist Autography</i> (University of
Minnesota
Press, 1996).  Perreault discusses Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Kate
Millett, and Patricia Williams; she also points to earlier users of the
term "autography," notably Michael Ryan in "Self Evidence" (review in
<i>Diacritics</i>, June 1980) and Jane Gallop in "Writing and Sexual
Difference:
The Difference Within" (in <i>Writing and Sexual Difference</i>, ed.
Elizabeth
Abel, Chicago, 1982).  I don't intend my use of the term to have any
feminist overtones.  </p>

<p><a name="2">2</a>.  As far as I know, this book was never reprinted
after its small initial run.  In an undated letter posted May 1,
1973--inserted in
the privately owned copy I looked at--Hejinian wrote to Oyez press asking
if they had any interest in publishing <i>the gRReat adventure</i>: "It
was
printed for me by a friend, for distribution through the Brain Frame
Company," which was dedicated to "open art distributed freely and
reciprocally through the mails.  As it turned out, postage for the
distribution of the book was far too expensive."  Presumably, Hejinian
soon gave up the idea of finding, as the letter puts it, "someone to
publish it properly."  </p> 

<p><a name="3">3</a>.   By Marjorie Perloff, for example: "<i>My Life</i>
conveys
what the archetypal life of a young American girl is like: '‘Even rain
didn't spoil the barbeque, in the backyard behind a polished traffic,
through a landscape along a shore' (p. 73)" (225).  The two pages on <i>My
Life</i> in Perloff's book would seem to be the beginning of Hejinian's
critical canonization.  Though Perloff is writing about the first edition
of <i>My Life</i>, her words are the single blurb on the back cover of the
second edition.  </p>

<p><a name="4">4</a>.  This point bears an uncanny resemblance to one made 
by Perloff in her new book <i>Wittgenstein's Ladder. Poetic Language and 
the Strangeness of the Ordinary</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 
1996).  Writing of Wittgenstein's turn to grammar after 1929, she 
summarizes his changed attitude towards language: "<i>Description thus 
replaces explanation</i>" (58).  She later quotes Wittgenstein's 
<i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, "We must do away with all 
explanation and description alone must take its place' (<i>PI</i> 
#109)" (135).  Perloff devotes a few pages to Hejinian in this new book, 
but she never mentions <i>My Life</i>, which might well belong to 
Perloff's list of recent works "written under the sign of Wittgenstein."  
</p>

<p><a name="5">5</a>.  Which is the differently worked point of Craig
Douglas Dworkin's quilt metaphor in his essay, "Penelope Reworking the
Twill: Patchwork, Writing, and Lyn Hejinian's <i>My Life</i>,"
<i>Contemporary Literature</i> XXXVI, 1 (1995).  Dworkin writes: "the
visual pleasures of the
irrevocably puzzled surface of the quilt offer a model for a reading of
<i>My
Life</i> that values the very incomprehensibility so often objected to in
contemporary writing and so well illustrated by the deliberately fractured
and fractal nature of Hejinian's work" (59).  </p>

<p><a name="6">6</a>.   Silliman's procedure is not entirely arbitrary, of
course--he considers the Fibonacci number series a figure for the truth of
Marxist thought.  See Jerome J. McGann, "Contemporary Poetry, Alternate
Routes," in Robert von Hallberg, ed., <i>Politics and Poetic Value</i>
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), 268-74. </p> 

<p><a name="7">7</a>.  Not that basing form on a subject's age is
entirely unprecedented.  Surrey, for example, wrote his eulogy for Wyatt,
"Wresteth here," in 38 lines, Wyatt's age when he was dispatched by Henry
VIII. </p>

<p><a name="8">8</a>.  For example, "An affectionate exhortation to those
who in early life feel themselves disposed to become authors" (XI),
"Supposed irritability of men of genius -- Brought to the test of facts --
Causes and occasions of the charge -- Its injustice" (II), "On the
imagination, or esemplastic power" (XIII), "A chapter of requests and
premonitions concerning the perusal or omission of the chapter that
follows" (XII), or, my favorite, "The former subject continued" (XX). </p>  

<p><a name="9">9</a>. And so with motion as well, reminiscent of the way
Virginia Woolf brings back words and phrases in <i>The Waves</i> (Hogarth
Press,
1931; rpt. Penguin, 1992).  Woolf's recurrences are never exact, however;
so we might say she presents more obviously than Hejinian does the
impossibility of repetition or "accurate" representation.  Bernard can say
"'As you passed the door of the tool-house I heard you cry "I am unhappy".
I put down my knife.  I was making boats out of firewood'" (9), and
Neville can say "'We were in the tool-shed making boats, and Susan came
past the door.  And Bernard dropped his boat and went after her taking my
knife'" (13), and the point is finally "'There are no repetitions for me.
Each day is dangerous.  Smooth on the surface, we are all bone beneath
like snakes coiling'" (163). </p> 

<p><a name="10">10</a>.  Again on the matter of literary pedigree,
Hejinian's alternating compact of prose and verse parts is loosely
reminiscent of the <i>prosimetra</i> in, say, Dante's <i>Vita Nuova</i>,
with 
its prose narrative, interpolated poems, and technical commentaries. </p>   

<p><a name="11">11</a>.  One of the
first reviewers of <i>My Life</i> seems to have been primarily struck by
the force--what he called the "Brownian movement"--of its destabilized
"I."  See Bruce Campbell, "'As Permeated Constructedness,' Lyn Hejinian:
<i>My Life</i>," in <i>Temblor</i> 9 (1989), 192-93: "we must recognize
that Hejinian's book cleaves to the generosity of 'my,' not its
appropriation.  We might ask, however, whether we truly want such
generosity" (192). </p>
