<b>Terminus</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Dominions over time construct 
<br>
<br>escarpments tilting just 
<br>
<br>upon the middle of a cross
<br>
<br>between availability and total
<br>
<br>degradation, a perfection
<br>
<br>of balance always in the exact
<br>
<br>center of the now, such a place
<br>
<br>as inescapable of doing.&nbsp;  "Language
<br>
<br>dreaming itself": the scaffolding
<br>
<br>of what it must reach out to, inevitable
<br>
<br>twirl of speed, a top of imperceptibles
<br>
<br>invisibly lacerates any shriek
<br>
<br>of solids in its path.&nbsp;  The best of hanging
<br>
<br>selves are no mere shadow
<br>
<br>to such a thought: every perch of wire
<br>
<br>strung along the intricate connections
<br>
<br>electrocutes its opposite continually,
<br>
<br>in the sense of electric and defy
<br>
<br>presides sustenance for every 
<br>
<br>possible lay of land: one angle
<br>
<br>must suggest the permanent light
<br>
<br>which operates outside all umbrellas,
<br>
<br>the rigid rescue of all marks themselves
<br>
<br>necessitates a future tense. &nbsp;It's nothing at all
<br>
<br>simple, though the images collect
<br>
<br>and vilify, poles and wires strung
<br>
<br>around earth like endless crucifixions
<br>
<br>encompass making turgid
<br>
<br>any act of thought.&nbsp; And yet another plane
<br>
<br>of stretching figures up and out and forth
<br>
<br>the justifiable abstract, electrons edging
<br>
<br>beautifully away, struck by their own
<br>
<br>volition, so indices recede untouchably
<br>
<br>not in forever, construed as a limitless 
<br>
<br>sum, but simultaneously, that very constant
<br>
<br>reigned over by the repetition of usages,
<br>
<br>a perfect compass of lines that point
<br>
<br>to every inch of time that can be surfaced
<br>
<br>by an immortal horizontal and a vertical stop.
