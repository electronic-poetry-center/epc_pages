<h3>Introduction to <i>Poetry and the Problem of Beauty</i></h3>
<p><h4>
<br>
<p>	Beauty is a problem for poetry because we no longer imagine beauty
as a serious way of knowing.  </p>
<p>	But it is.  Beauty wedges into the artistic space a structure for
continuously imagining what we do not know.  This claim reverses Shelley's
formulation of poetry as the place where we "imagine that which we know,"
which presumes that creativity translates knowledge into imagination.  Our
general lack of response to beauty nowadays--at least in critical
literature--results, among other things, from an intuitive sense that
beauty defies such translation.  We can neither measure the knowledge that
Shelley's imagination turns to beauty, nor can we translate that beauty
back into its components of knowledge and imagination.  That's because
beauty is a non-conceptual way of knowing.  We have developed, implicitly,
a sense of the non-conceptual in artistic beauty; but we have not much
developed sympathetic theories that will allow us to discuss beauty in
these terms.  We still largely imagine beauty in Shelley's terms, and so
we think that those parts of beauty which resist the translation
<i>back</i> to
knowledge are uselessly private and uncommunicative.  In fact, they are
what beauty "knows": that knowledge is also--perhaps most
importantly--what we do not yet know.  Forms of beauty are resistant
structures, imaginative structures that present an impenetrable model of
the unknown.  Beauty is therefore endlessly talk-inspiring, predictive
rather than descriptive, dynamic rather than settled, infinitely serious
and useful. </p>
<p>	That beauty cannot be translated into expository terms is a
particular problem for poetry, especially in an abstract language like
English.  Poetry's material (language) is, in other contexts,
overwhelmingly used and valued for its conceptual and communicative
facilities.  We imagine, to couch the point in terms of Pound's
<i>logopoeia</i>,
that poetic beauty is insufficiently difficult or concept-provoking.  But
when we distinguish pleasing or mellifluous versions of <i>phanopoeia</i>
and <i>melopoeia</i> from the conceptual discursive world of
<i>logopoeia</i>, we err if we
think the first two simple-minded and the last the place of seriousness.
"Music is feeling, then, not sound," writes Stevens, and we think that we
cannot <i>think</i> about feeling or music, since they are subjective and
ineluctable.  We think we cannot say anything critically useful about
them, and so we divide aesthetics from theoretical and/or conceptual
content and concentrate on the latter, about which we feel we can say
something.  </p>
<p>	The problem is compounded by some of the critical correctives of
the last couple of decades.<A HREF="beauty.html#1">1</A>  As we pursue
historical, cultural, and
gender-based critical modes, theories of beauty are often labeled
hegemonic models bequeathed by white males, in part because they often are
(Shelley's, for example).  Taking beauty seriously, developing theories of
beauty, is out of fashion.  As a result, we really have not gotten much
further in our theories than Alexander Baumgarten's definition of a poem
as a "perfect sensate discourse" (39)--communicating content via sensory
form--or Kant's antinomy of taste, which is fairly useless if we hold that
aesthetic disinterestedness is a contradiction in terms.  In fact, when
Baumgarten coined "aesthetic" from the Greek <i>aisthesis</i> ("sensory
perception") he was perhaps more enlightened than we often are about the
power of the senses, since he wanted to make serious place for the "lower"
sensory functions among "higher" functions of rational meaning.  </p>
<br>
<p>	So, what is the experience of poetic beauty?  It is, first of all,
subjective interestedness.  Interestedness requires sympathy, so poetic
beauty might be defined as the result of subjective sympathy: paying
enough attention to a poem for it to teach us how to read it <i>and</i>
(crucially) feeling that it fulfills the terms it lays out.  These terms
may be of many varieties, such as lyricism, word attention, sound
dissonance, even of a faltering which is part of the poem's point.  Poems
whose beauty strikes us overwhelmingly and immediately are poems that use
well some of the rules we are well trained to perceive.  Poems whose
beauty takes time for us to appreciate have worked to increase our
aesthetic faculties.</p>  
<p>	This is not to say that all poems are beautiful.  Many do not
fulfill the terms of their own construction, and so leave us feeling
dissatisfied.  On the other hand, some poems leave us feeling dissatisfied
because that is part of their point.  It is as impossible to determine the
difference--in terms of establishing interpretive predictions or tools--as
it is to define poetic beauty.  Beauty is contingent and unique and cannot
be derived from or defined according to rules or explanatory codes.  But I
want to insist that poetic beauty is important to talk about and wonderful
to experience.  As Wendy Steiner puts it, "the pleasures of art, however
scandalous they have come to be seen, are valuable and worth protecting"
(80).  </p>
<p>	One of the difficulties in writing about <i>poetic</i> beauty is
that poetry, being all of the same basic matter--ie, words--is always
formed and therefore, in the <i>formositas</i> sense, always beautiful.
To put it in Scholastic or phenomenological terms: the "material" object
of poetry is language, its marks and sounds; the "intentional" object is
how we
(subjectively) read that material.  In the material sense language is
beautiful, while in the intentional sense--well, it all depends on our
training.  What Westerners commonly register as ugliness is the
<i>effort</i> of
poetic language to resist formal regularity, whether at the level of
phoneme, word, line, or overall form.  This resistance sounds harsh in
part because it is resistance and in part because it has to go so far to
get somewhere that approximates escape from expected poetic
manifestations, as in these lines from Bruce Andrews' "The Impatient
Heart":
<p> 
church bells howitzers aloft to oust who suspect they've come as
<br>idea of beauty must matrimonial aside attention suddenly spirited
<br>to smooth a tug also in attendance in defense of hand flintlock 
<br>rifles ego amid keys gaiety of sleepwalking had cornered </p>
This passage fulfills some conditions of poetic beauty: moving relations
of sound and vision, accumulations of diaphanous and concrete
referentiality, mouthfuls of language.  The vowels dance with the
consonants: "-ur- -el- -owitzer- -oft to oust who" moves to "suddenly
spirited to smooth."  How is this kind of poetic beauty different from
what we might expect to hear discussed in an essay about mellifluous
poetic beauty?  We might expect to read excerpts from Yeats or Gjertrud
Schnackenberg, or at the very least from some of Stein's or David
Bromige's sweet simplicities.  But poetic beauty is not only evident
lyricisms or the apparently perfect mesh of prosodic tool with signified
point.  To risk a definition that pre-defines nothing: poetic beauty is a
different thing in different poems. </p>
<br>
<p>	So, what is the <i>problem</i> of poetic beauty?  It is not simply
the neglect of beauty, or the denial of its existence; it is also the
several <i>reasons</i> for that neglect and denial.  One reason for the
failure 
of interest in beauty is erotic repression.  Beauty is always, to a
greater or lesser extent, tied to the erotic.  André Breton calls this
"convulsive beauty": art he likes must "arouse a physical sensation . . .
I could never avoid establishing some relation between this sensation and
that of erotic pleasure, finding only a difference of degree" (8).
Jeffrey C. Robinson laments that "In denying ourselves the beautiful, we
have lost in addition the erotic experience that accompanies our access to
it and our experience of it.  This, in a society as neurotic about desire
as ours, should come as no surprise" (7).  </p>
<p>	But we don't admit denying ourselves the beautiful; we just give
it other names in an effort to dismantle it into formal or cultural
properties.  That's because another problem with beauty is that it
presupposes, inescapably, interestedness.  Criticism longs for
disinterestedness, so it longs to disassemble all things which seem to
prove that disinterestedness cannot exist.  But--to re-write Kant--the
delight which determines the judgment of taste is utterly dependent on
interests of various kinds.<A HREF="beauty.html#2">2</A>  It does not follow
that interestedness
decreases our vocabularies, least of all our ways of seeing and knowing.
On the contrary: to expose interest is to expose its endlessly varying
manifestations, to increase rather than to limit both what we can say and
what we can think.  </p>
<p>	Bound up with both its erotic components and its inherent
interestedness is the fact that beauty <i>is</i> a manipulative force.  In
biological terms, poetic beauty seems to be the supernormal releasor of
the language world.  We recognize our sensible reaction to its charms, but
once out of nature we want to prove that it has lost dominion over us, and
so we refuse the irrational form-intensity of poetry.  We don't want, as
discursive groups, to be tyrannized by love, desire, or sensation, so we
say that because they are subjective they effectively no longer exist as
discursive issues.  In neglecting to talk about them we are a bit like the
devil in Blake's <i>Milton</i>: "Satan Refusing Form." </p>
<p>	We have at least not abandoned the modern urge to intensity, which
is another frame for the question of beauty.  The common opposition
between modernism's urge to intensity and postmodernism's knowing better
seems to me false.  Postmodernism's theoretical refusal of intensity
belies its practical embraces: trauma art, Sylvia Plath, bored violence,
poetry slams, William Vollmann, Veronica Forrest-Thomson, celebrating
failure, all these rely on surface-to-depth intensity, cousin to the
eighteenth-century Sublime.  We might well find, for both modern and
postmodern versions of beauty, common ground in an aesthetics of
intensity.  </p>
<p>	The difference in the postmodern aesthetics of intensity, perhaps,
is that we want somehow to <i>be</i> the intensity, not to attribute it to
a
form.  So we open up a gap between the intensity, which is us, and the
poem or art object, which comes to resemble a cultural husk.  To put it
another way: theory and culture, as group projects, tend to exclude
sensibility; but poetry always has sensibility, which must be experienced
subjectively.  It was Hume, as we know, who took us from the object of
beauty to its perceiving subject.  In forming critical groups, we are
forced to re-emphasize the <i>object</i> of beauty: we write essays or
books
about poetry, and our writings mediate between us as readers and writers
and between us and the poetry, in a triangular objectification of poetry,
critic, and (often critical) reader.  We don't <i>see</i> (sense) each
other, we
read each other.  Because this objectification--through the distancing of
both poetic object and critical stance--is a false emphasis, the object
ends up being emptied of its sensible beauty, which is always a question
of subjective human (though potentially shared) experience.  So we end up
saying that the object has no beauty, and that we are wrong to speak of
beauty, from a longing to solidify group perceptions in and about the
object.  The subjective experience of beauty becomes closeted, off the
record.<A HREF="beauty.html#3">3</A>  As Charles Lock puts it, "Perspective
is the way out of
participation, our protection from confusion and involvement.  Being left
outside is the price of objectivity" (413).<A HREF="beauty.html#4">4</A></p>    
<p>	There are many other "problems" of poetic beauty we might
consider: its historical links with morality and cultural instruction
("beauty is truth"; cure ugliness to cure society); its maddening
self-sufficiency and self-possession; the paradox of its seriousness,
given that it doesn't know much philosophically or intellectually.  But
two things I feel pretty sure of: the first is the argument that began
this précis, that beauty is a structure for imagining what we don't know.
The second is that beauty must change <i>within</i> the "unchanged" work.
Poetry
wants to be timeless or immobilized ("Not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes," etc.), but it also wants to live.<A HREF="beauty.html#5">5</A> 
It is up to good readings
to find both the temporal intactness and the contemporary potential of any
poetic beauty.

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>
<a name="1">1</a>.  As Jeffrey C. Robinson notes: "Academic Marxists and
feminist literary studies have effaced the beautiful, finding it by
implication if not openly a phenomenon created or promoted by capitalism
or by the masculine bias in literary production.  These days it simply
seems irrelevant to the more pressing concerns of history and gender"
(6-7).</p>
<p><a name="2">2</a>.  In the first book of <i>The Critique of
Judgement</i>, Kant wrote: "The delight which determines the judgement of
taste is independent of all interest." </p>
<p><a name="3">3</a>.  So that Wendy Steiner admits "It has taken me a
long time to admit that the thrust of criticism is the 'I like,' and
whatever expertise I have accumulated conspires in this admission."  See
especially pp. 6-8, 80-90 for useful and forthright considerations of the
importance of artistic beauty and subjective pleasure.
</p>
<p><a name="4">4</a>.  This after Lock reminds us that "perspective was
the very condition of the scientific revolution, and thus of the cognitive
revolution by which knowledge became objective'" (410). 
</p>
<p><a name="5">5</a>.  This point is, in a way, in sympathy with
Baudelaire's twofold idea of beauty, except that I fail to see "eternal"
or "invariable" elements in poetic language.  See his <i>Curiosit&eacutes
esthétiques, L'Art romantiques et autres oeuvres critiques</i>.  Ed. Henri
Lemaitre (Paris: Garnier Frères, 1962): "le beau est fait d'un élément
éternel, invariable, dont la quantité est excessivement difficile à
déterminer, et d'un élément relatif, circonstantiel qui sera, si l'on
veut, tour à tour ou tout ensemble, l'époque, la mode, la morale, la
passion" (455-56).
