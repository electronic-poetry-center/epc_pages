<p align="justify" class="style5"><span class="style6">ANNE  TARDOS is the author of seven books of poetry</span><span class="style7">.</span> Her  writing is renowned for its fluid use of multiple languages and its  innovative forms. She has worked in numerous media, creating  performance pieces, radio plays, videos and many CDs, often with her  late husband, the poet and composer Jackson Mac Low. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos  has taught poetry</strong> <strong>at  many universities</strong></span>. She is  among the guest faculty at Naropa University (2008, 1994) and has  lectured at Bard College (2008), UC Berkeley (2003), SUNY-Buffalo  (2003), The New School (2001), University of Hawaii-Manoa (1999), The  School of Poetry of Vienna (1996, 1994, 1993), University of Szeged,  Hungary (1993), UC San Diego (1990), School of Visual Arts, New York  (1987), SUNY-Albany (1986), and the Brooklyn Museum Art School  (1982). She works as an Editorial Consultant for <em>The  Nation</em>, <em>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</em> and such publishers as Simon &amp; Schuster and Random House.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos&rsquo;s  poetry has appeared in dozens of journals</strong></span>,  including<em> The Germ, Chain,  Washington Square,</em> and  several issues of <em>Conjunctions. </em></p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Her  latest book, </strong><em><strong>I Am You</strong></em></span> (Salt Publishing, 2008), is a collection of three long poems that  explore the limits of language, time, subjectivity and grief. A  deeply personal elegy for Mac Low, <em>I  Am You</em> is also a poetic  inquiry into the boundaries of the human subject. As poet John  Kinsella writes, &ldquo;it is <span lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB">a  brilliant and disturbing masterpiece &ndash; an unpicking of elegy and  its inevitable entanglements with &lsquo;autobiography.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span> In her new vision of these genres, Tardos reveals the Self to be  plural, permeated and unfamiliar. &ldquo;It should really be called  selves. There are so many of us assembled/here,&rdquo; she writes in the  poem &ldquo;Letting Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>In  April 2008, Tardos read from </strong><em><strong>I  Am You</strong></em></span> for the Ashbery  Poetry Series at Bard College and the Segue Series at the Bowery  Poetry Club in New York. In May, UbuWeb&mdash;the online archive for the  arts&mdash;created a page for Tardos with recordings of her poetry and  performance works. Tardos&rsquo;s work is also being hosted online by the  University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s collection of poetry recordings,  PennSound. In July, Tardos taught, lectured and read from <em>I  Am You</em> at the Jack Kerouac  School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style11"><span class="style10"><em><strong>Thing of Beauty: New  and Selected Works</strong></em><strong> by  Jackson Mac Low</strong></span><span class="style3">,</span> edited by Tardos</span>, released earlier this year by the University of California Press, provides a general outline of Mac Low&rsquo;s poetic oeuvre and  includes many previously unpublished texts. Tardos&rsquo;s editorial work  has been highly lauded, with <em>Publishers  Weekly</em> stating that <em>Thing  of Beauty</em> &ldquo;does  the best job to date in providing a window into Mac Low&rsquo;s unique  perspective on what constitutes poetic beauty.&rdquo;  For  collecting many of Mac Low&rsquo;s artworks, Tardos  received a grant from the Judith Rothschild Foundation.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style12">The  Dik-dik&rsquo;s Solitude: New &amp; Selected Works</span> (Granary Books, 2003) <strong>gives an  overview of Tardos&rsquo;s poetic career</strong>,  collecting new poems and excerpts from her three previous books, as  well as essays, images and musical compositions. Upon its release, <em>Publishers Weekly</em> labeled the book &ldquo;a virtual encyclopedia of artistic techniques.&rdquo;  In 2003, Belladonna Books released a chapbook by Tardos, entitled <em><strong>A  Noisy Nightingale Understands the Tiger&rsquo;s Camouflage Totally</strong></em>.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos&rsquo;s  third book of poetry, </strong><em><strong>Uxudo</strong></em></span> (O Books / Tuumba Press,  1999), presents her writing at its most plurilingual and neologistic,  along with digitally modified video stills and translations. Poet Ron  Silliman called the work &ldquo;a gift from technology, [an] illuminated  manuscript [&hellip;] interactive in a sense that Blake would have  understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos  has participated in many international poetry festivals</strong></span>,  such as the Festival Roaratorio France-Amerique, Geneva (2005);  Festival La B&acirc;tie, Geneva (2000); WORD(S)OUND, Miami (1993);  Milanopoesia, Milan (1989); Zwischent&ouml;ne,  Cologne (1989); John  Cage Festival-Symposium, Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT (1988  and 1989); St. Georg Church, Cologne (1985); the <em>text-ljud</em> Festival, Stockholm (1984); The London Musicians Collective, London  (1984); and Scene Wien, Vienna (1983). She contributed to the  conference Poetry &amp; Pedagogy: the Challenge of the Contemporary,  at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY (1999). </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Her  multilingual performance work </strong><em><strong>Among  Men </strong></em></span>was premiered by the  Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1994 in New York, and  subsequently recorded by the WDR (West German Radio), where the  piece was a finalist in the 1996 Acoustica International contest. <em>Among Men</em> consists of 17 music scores and two reader&rsquo;s scores, with text  based on encyclopedia entries for female artists and the first names  of the men whose entries fall between theirs. The scores utilize  collaged sound and visual elements from female musicians and artists,  with variation allowed for in performance according to the visibility  of a note on the score. <em>Among  Men</em> was also performed live  at Roulette, New York (1996); the Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna (1994);  and the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa  University, Boulder, CO (1994). </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos&rsquo;s  numerous readings and performances</strong></span>,  often with Jackson Mac Low, include Writers Live! at Pratt Institute  (2001); A Memorial Intermedia Evening of Works by Dick Higgins, at  the Whitney Museum in New York (1999); Days of Silence, a John Cage  symposium, Warsaw (1993); <em>Cagemusicircus</em>,  Symphony Space, New York (1992); Center for the Fine Arts, Knox  College, Galesburg, IL (1987); Galleri Sct. Agnes, Roskilde, Denmark  (1985); University of Houston, TX (1985); Studio Morra, Naples  (1983); Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1983); Palais des Beaux Arts,  Brussels (1982). Tardos collaborated with Mac Low on the composition  and performance of <em>First and  Third Four-Language Word Events in Memoriam John Cage</em> (Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1994) and <em>Cellular  Dialogue</em> (SEOUL-NYMAX  Festival / Anthology Film Archives / Biblio&rsquo;s, New York, 1994). </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>In  Tardos&rsquo;s poetry of the 1980s</strong></span>,  she pioneered  a unique polylingual style and complemented her texts with  photographs, video stills and computer graphics. <strong>Her  early books </strong><em><strong>Mayg-shem  Fish</strong></em> (Potes  &amp; Poets Press, 1995) and <em><strong>Cat  Licked the Garlic</strong></em> (Tsunami Editions, 1992)  reflect her multilingual, multi-media approach to writing. She  developed her poem &ldquo;Ami Minden&rdquo; into a video installation for the  exhibit &ldquo;<strong>Between Word and  Image</strong>&rdquo; at the Museum of  Modern Art, New York in 1993. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos  has displayed her visual</strong> <strong>text work</strong></span> in the <em>FluxAttitudes</em> show at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York (1992); at the  Chicago Art Institute (1993); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los  Angeles (1993); the Fluxus Pavillion of La Biennale di Venezia,  Venice (1990); and the Palais des Beaux Arts, Bordeaux, where she  installed her film <em>Faces</em> (1972). Her 1974 video of the  dancer Simone Forti was featured in the 2000 Whitney Biennial.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos&rsquo;s  five-monitor video installation </strong><em><strong>Apple  Eaters</strong></em></span> premiered at The  Kitchen in New York in 1972. The tapes were restored and re-edited  into a one-channel version by the Kitchen in 2003, and is being  distributed by Electronic Arts Intermix.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><span class="style10"><strong>Tardos  received her education in film and the visual arts</strong></span>,  attending the Vienna Film Academy from 1963-65, then the Art Students  League of New York, from 1966-70, for which she  received grants from the Ford Foundation for the years 1967-70. </p>
