UNTIL THE FEATHEREND OF HEAVEN</font><br>

The child has her eyes <br> 
It has the father's owls <br> 
Feathered hunt Joe Deather <br> 
Seapocks awailin' in the willory <br> 
But her stare - just a Hi...from <br> 
the deader's hold <p>

Childero gallanceer <br> 
Sweet raven chapter of my youth <br> 
My hair was a peacock in heaven <br> 
for you, a wild palamino with <br> 
parents of plume <br> 
Sweet natured and distant - this one <p>

is tarrow slim <br> 
vulgar - this one bequeathes <br> 
a solvent mare - my hair holds <br> 
your gaze, my skin - your stare...this one's gone <br> 
This one has <br> 
your child your face - twinner <br> 
Dark, thyner - mare finder in the hailbry <br> 
Follow in the whisss, I wildew <br> 
where the wasn't hollow <br> 
Where I hel and held and stared at glass <br> 
Poe'wd'ered pink stale paler still <br> 
neckless...my t'will resin shifting <br> 
quills <i>against</i> against - my hand - held <i>froze</i><br> 
Against my hold <p>

I play inside this picture <br> 
falling face flance an'scrope <br> 
I cry against bitterbit flawless <br> 
features, the color of my room <br> 
I find my locks in my shouldering death <br> 
my father in my size - the child <br> 
has the hoofs of a falcon <p>

Were I heaven surprised <br> 
I'd have gutted a raven, left a trail <br> 
for your eyes - wise rocks <br> 
they are cinder...and I <br> 
Am I what you leave <br> 
as you fall from the sky <p>
