Edwin Torres is a bilingual poet, rooted in the
languages of both sight and sound. He's been creating
text and performance work since 1988. Mingling the
textures of poetry with vocal & physical
improvisation, sound-elements and visual theater...his
live performances create organic landscapes that exist
beyond language.<p>

His introduction to poetry was through The Nuyorican
Poets Cafe and The St. Marks Poetry Project, where
he’s worked as workshop leader and curator. His debut
CD Holy Kid (Kill Rock Stars) combines poetry with
music, sounds and homemade tapes, and is included in
the exhibition The American Century Pt. II At The
Whitney Museum Of American Art.<p>

From 1993-99, he was a member of the poetry
collective, Real Live Poetry (formerly Nuyorican Poets
Cafe Live) with whom he performed and conducted
workshops across the United States and overseas,
applying his practice to many situations; from schools
to farms, from festivals to beaches, from Alaska to
Australia, from beer halls to Memphis.<p>

He's also collaborated with a variety of performers,
musicians, dancers, videographers, poets &
lithographers…opening all available  portals (you
still with me?). He's been the recipient of a one-year
fellowship from The Foundation For Contemporary
Performance Art, as well as The Nuyorican Poets Cafe
Fresh Prize For Poetry…applause…among other awards.<p>

Finally, (where is the legacy of a bitter fool) his
media assault has transpired on MTV’s Spoken Word
Unplugged and The Charlie Rose Show and then (do you
really want to know all this) on Newsweek, Rolling
Stone, New York Magazine, High Times (I am NOT
anti-drug). In NYC, Torres (as he calls himself) has
performed at many venues like (here we go) The
Nuyorican Poets Cafe, Dixon Place (hello Ellie), The
Guggenheim Museum, CBGB's, Tonic, my mother’s kitchen,
P.S. 122, WFMU Radio, Lincoln Center, The Museum Of
Modern Art…and he’s still confusing a lot of folks.<p>

Thanks for putting up with this…but the real stuff is
the poetry…the spirit of one's heart…to be true…enjoy!<p>
