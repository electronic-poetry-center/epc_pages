I have seen Edwin Torres dancing to the sound of a
musical saw while wearing a hat of dirt on his head in
a store window, and once wearing pure white with the
painter/poet Elizabeth Castagna on New Year's day
1999.  I've always wanted to be Edwin Torres for a
day, to think like him, to wear cool glasses, to be as
tall and thin, to have Puerto Rican soul so I could
write "I'm near a tiger's smooch, BURP!" Or to
audaciously title a poem "Thru the Looking Ass." Or to
say "Chuckles evince themselves/laughily from my rhino
nose/Rhinocerose gear up / through shredded
membrane..."<p>
        <i>Fractured Humorous</i> is a complex book composed of
multiple journeys; a book of travel, a book of
fractures and a book of healing. It is a visit with
the fractist, who in healing becomes the healer. The
nomad is a constant in Torres' work, an alter ego for
this poet who is claimed by a diverse group of
avant-garde factions that include: The Nuyorican Poets
Cafe, Poetry Project, and the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E school.
Thus he finds himself a nomad, a traveler among poets.<p>
 There is a reason why Torres is claimed by all poetic
camps, and that is because he is an extraordinary
poet. <i>Fractured Humorous,</i> selected and edited by Carol
Mirakove for the Subpress collective,  is
extraordinary poetry.<p>
        The book begins with a literal fracture and goes
on to explore fractures and healing of different
natures. The book is divided into five sections by
time and place, and then further divided by single
transition poems that allow the reader as well as poet
to shift gears and prepare for the next journey. You
could think of <i>Fractured Humorous</i> as a wonderland,
however, unlike Alice, Torres is the inventor.  And it
may be where he prefers to live. It is more than
speech and linguistic/logic razzle-dazzle, it is
writing from the heart of the nomad, the lonely truth
seeker, and shaman who journeys on in spite of our
selfish and self-destructive nature.<p>
        In the introductory poem "Roaming as the Roamers Do,"
Torres lays out his naked ambitions and intentions. He
fully confesses his belief in the power of language to
divide and to heal, it is this faith in language that
drives the nomad forward: "...to play the mindfields
offa fractured stomp//<society as a multimingual
somethingle> to fess up to the fact-that- // the
ramifications of this <inner > playground / manifest
themselves with every fantasy i  / denude myself in //
now naked in my fracture < deluded nudist manufactured
> / <tracked in rapture > the fracturist / soars above
 the mend / aware of what needs to meet / to make the
heal complete."<p>
        In this collection, it is the body, as well as place,
that exerts a gravitational pull on Torres' wonder
world. The first section "fracture ::  one month /
with broken arm in bed"  deals with the poet's
post-accident awareness. Torres writes "After my
accident, I found myself walking the streets / with
alert-risers on full ... for left side."   The broken
arm is loaded with metaphor, for Torres images himself
 "as a winged warrior." The body is what grounds this
nomad literally and figuratively. A month in bed
allows the poet's imagination and humor to fluorish
while his body and psyche recover. "May Cause
Drowsiness" comes with the instruction "recite in
heavy accent of non-determined origin" : "Ah. The
killers of pain. / Do not, it says here...Operate /
heavy machinery! / No crane! / No lifting! / Do not,
for example...Affect revenge / on nine-year old bully
whom / you would wish dead! DO NOT — is a bad / thing
to do...On these killers! Did I mention —oh—do not
erect / the four-story...DON'T DO THAT!"<p>
        Torres' nomad is a romantic. It is love that propels
the restless seeker. The six part "Fractured Humerus"
opens with a female presence:<p>

"My wings she asked<p>

<blockquote>

<i>
Are they injured Will you be able to complete your
mission<br>
How about the expanse they cover Their breadth Will
they keep<br>
their hover Are we still in mid-flight What about your
fancy's tails<br>
Will we remain in their obstruction Is moonity glow
still just a<br>
starlit waif away You promised me a curve Has that
been interrupted</i>"

<p>

</blockquote>


    In "alaska :: five days / with poets in snow," the
presence of Mother Earth awes the nomad. "How daring
you are, mother / How simple to place / your coldest
daughter underneath your / hottest flame and my heart,
here ... Caught / in your frozen arms." The last poem
in Fractured Humorous is a love poem, as the nomad
contemplates the return of his lover amid the ruins of
post-commist Berlin: "Rimfires of /revolution filtered
through me, ... Where we are / one direction, where my
west waits / for changes in the wind, changes / To
bring my east back to me."<p>
        "diana:: one day/ with sister in boston" is unusually
straightforward and tender. The poet has one short day
to say goodbye to his sister who is leaving for
Africa, her other home, for one long year. The poems
reveal the distance, distance creates. "... We didn't
know / what to get you ... you're so hard to / shop
for, so we decided / on money, you decide / what's
important." The sister mirrors the nomadic poet,  "I
look at her journey ... / when you go to something
that isn't / on steady ground, you look / to hold onto
something you know. And so / we sigh, to hear our
breath / our lungs .... work."<p>
        The effects of place on language are most fully
realized inTorresian speech as in "england :: three
weeks / with poets in van."  Compare Lewis Carroll's:
"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves/ Did gyre and
gimble in the wabe:/ All mimsy were the borogoves, /
And the mome raths outgrabe"<p>

with:<p>

<blockquote>

"When little kids<br>
in foreign lands, jibber,<br>
They jibber in foreign tongues.<br>
The little fipps<br>
 they ask for as little kids will do,<br>
Become jibbering jibbs with accents--my<br>
how flippery-foo!"<p>

</blockquote>

"Through the Looking Ass" is a hysterical entry point
into a Nuyorican/UK world as the narrator in search of
his cat crawls through the looking ass:<p>

<blockquote>

"I'm now inside my plumber's hole<br>
looking for my cat, with<br>
no clothes on. Me and the animal<br>
are naked ... on all fours.<p>

I find things I've misplaced<br>
when I was 90 years old - I'm not even<br>
50 yet, so it's a curious thing<br>
to discover - what I'm going to lose<br>
before I get it.<p>

Waterpipes soakup atmosphere and cat-hair.<br>
I call his name out and hear<br>
a hollow ringing from my mouth ... Another hole<br>
appears on my face<br>
where my mouth should be.<p>

I'm naked and step inside this new hole.<br>
I'm in - what my mouth is-<br>
when I shut-up ... I'm serene<br>
with no hat, sitting on a plumber's vacation<br>
where a hole rules my life<br>
everytime I sit on the toilet."<p>

</blockquote>

In the final segment "berlin:: three days / with pen
on mayakovsky lane, " Berlin seems like a sister city
to the Lower East Side, with its squatters and artists
inhabiting a decaying industrial landscape teeming
with struggle and possibility. The centerpiece of this
section "The Architect of Change", written five years
after the wall fell, is almost a manifesto. It is full
of optimism as the poet imagines the possibilities of
Berlin, the fractured city once divided, now healing:<p>

<nobr>
<blockquote>
<i>
"In the architecture of change, the blueprints rust<br>
as the artists take over. In the neon twilight, a new
generation ages quickly,<br>
before you can say elder, before your eyes, a
generation of twilight bluers,<br>
quill-glow on the resonance of reverberation, on the
warmth of concrete hillsides,<br>
in the fields of rocket sculpture, stillborn in their
movement of hope."<p></i>
</blockquote>
</nobr>
        In the last stanza, the nomad bears witness and
shares:<p>

<blockquote>

 "I do these acts of chivalry thinking nobility is my
engine<br>
I've been here...just like you, neighbor<br>
What I've seen is in my time, is all<br>
I have eyes like you, pen like you<br>
So why is this heart so new<br>
As it sees envisioning differents upon visits<br>
Of declaration and splendor<br>
It telegrams them to you, dear neighbor ... who are<br>
now beside me<br>
Re-visioning your see, as this<br>
Goes on "<p>

</blockquote>

    Torres remains the most optimistic, agile poet
around. <i>Fractured Humorous</i> is a poetics of possibility
and romance. His nomad is not a cynic but a heroic
wanderer who, in spite of and because of the human
condition, journeys on.<p>
