WARZAWA INFINITE</font><br>
<font size=5>by Edwin Torres  </font><p>
<hr width=75% align=left><p>

I'm so tired of seeing my heroes fall <br>
of scaling unsurmountable isms - as a seek<br>
for impossible heights - as a cornerstone<br>
to my own frailty - how dare I<p>

to imply a zenith on anyone else <br>
but me - to live out my climb <br>
on the failure of others - I'm so tired<p>

of all my heroes <br>
realizing me into this fantasy of none <br>
I'm not even watching anymore<p>

the last hold on that branch <br>
prevents the fall <br>
until help comes but you know <br>
a handshake is a distant come-on <br>
for a fancy champion <br>
who fancies himself into angular jazzbone<p>

until fossilized <br>
by his own sifting recognition <br>
liar sandstone grips the fall<p>

flatly saved against cerulean's handsome loneliness <br>
he is pretty in his climb <br>
a ladder in his prime<p>

liar redstone <br>
lives the day aghast <br>
until the whattaya-say...will you retrieve me <br>
will I never see <br>
will it all be hero-reason against <br>
rightstone rimshot<p>

I'm so tired of these realizations that prove <br>
just how right I am <br>
I'd like to be wrong once - really I would<p>

I'd like to confront my reason <br>
with microscopic serenity <br>
rising south by this nuthouse gaze<p>

but heroes will do that to you <br>
heroes give you reason, to question <br>
resolve, to wonder <br>
how you ripped yourself so open <br>
to once believe in something <br>
besides yourself<p>
