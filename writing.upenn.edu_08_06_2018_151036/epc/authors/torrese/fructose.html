The fruits of the child shall get <br>
stuck in the labor the child <br>
gets stuck during labor doing labor <br>
the child obeys labor laws while enjoying <br>
fruit the flaws for fruit are different <br>
than the laws of children they occupy <br>
a different obeying fruit obey chicken without laws <br>
but the law maintains another standard for children <br>
who labor under the fruit of their obeying <br>
the child obeys when it's time for pain <br>
nothing to do for the fruit of labor but obey <br>
the child of the newly born pain.<p>
