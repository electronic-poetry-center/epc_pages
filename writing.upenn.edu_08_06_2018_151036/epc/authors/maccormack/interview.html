<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Marjorie Perloff writes 
  of Karen Mac Cormack, "No one writing poetry in North America today can match 
  Karen Mac Cormack's exquisite poise, the integrity of her poetic line, her command 
  of verbal nuance, pun, and paragram." Astounding readers since her first collection 
  of poetry, <i>Nothing by Mouth</i> (Underwhich, 1984) -- which Judith Fitzgerald 
  called "quite simply, a masterpiece" -- Mac Cormack has continued to produce 
  challenging and remarkably invovative texts, each volume continuing, yet expanding 
  upon, her interests in the nuances of language, verbal disjunction, the mechanics 
  of the sentence, and the discourse of both formal and quotidian textuality.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Zambia, 
  and living at various times in the United States, England, Mexico and Canada, 
  Mac Cormack is the author of eight collections of poetry including <i>Straw 
  Cupid</i> (Nightwood, 1987), <i>Quill Driver</i> (Nightwood, 1989), <i>Quirks 
  and Quillets</i> (Chax, 1991), <i>Marine Snow</i> (ECW, 1995) and <i>The Tongue 
  Moves Talk</i> (Chax/ West House, 1997). Mac Cormack's work has been anthologized 
  in such collections as <i>Into the Nightlife</i> (Nightwood, 1986) and <i>The 
  Gertrude Stein Awards in Innovative North American Poetry</i> (Sun and Moon, 
  1994), as well as the important <i>Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative 
  Poetry by Women in North America and the UK</i> (Reality Street, 1996) and <i>Moving 
  Borders</i> (Talisman House, 1998). In 1998, Mac Cormack published her most 
  recent collection, <i>FIT TO PRINT</i>, a collaboration with British poet Alan 
  Halsey that utilizes and interrogates the structure and language of contemporary 
  newspapers. </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Stephen Cain: You have recently 
  published the collaborative project, <i>FIT TO PRINT</i>, with British poet 
  Alan Halsey. How did this collaboration come about, and how did it work? </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Karen Mac Cormack: <i>FIT 
  TO PRINT</i> is my first finished, published collaboration. (Steve McCaffery 
  and I now have two incomplete collaborative works, both titled "From a Middle." 
  The first was abandoned more than ten years ago, the more recent one we began 
  in June 1999.) <i>FIT TO PRINT</i> was already underway when I decided to re-read 
  Alan Halsey's <i>Reasonable Distance</i> at the end of December 1995. I wrote 
  a poem as a response to it (though not in the double column format that dominates 
  FTP) and sent it to Alan, whose own response (poem) to the then-recently published 
  <i>Marine Snow</i> crossed the Atlantic at the same time (January of 1996). 
  I then sent him the existing FTP poems along with a description of the project 
  and he responded to those, at which point we realized a collaboration was in 
  effect. (I should mention that I first met Alan in England in 1989 when he came 
  to a reading of Steve's and mine in Oxford. Prior to that I'd written to him 
  [after reading some of his work in <i>Writing</i> magazine earlier in the 1980s] 
  so a correspondence was already in place.)<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FTP's 
  format on the page intentionally refers to that most daily of reading materials 
  -- the newspaper. However, the poems themselves, while displaying a concern 
  with and for daily events (and these range from earthquakes to conditions of 
  weather), do not adopt a "transit" theory of meaning. Together we approached 
  the newspaper format as a way of fusing issues of mass culture with a non-traditional 
  writing practice. The newspaper column produces unexpected ruptures that the 
  reader learns to negotiate. Our intention was to apply this achieved negotiation 
  to a writing that departs from the "habit" of a conventional language.<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most 
  of FTP was written on either side of the Atlantic and the poems were sent sometimes 
  singly to and fro, sometimes in batches. (Alan was still living in Hay-on-Wye 
  in Wales and we were both amazed that on average our letters took three days 
  to arrive in either direction! Alan bought his first computer while FTP was 
  in the works [his initial FTP poems were done on a word processor].) Alan did 
  visit Steve and myself when we were living in California in 1997 and that was 
  the only time we discussed the work face to face and wrote some of it in the 
  same locale. I don't recall either one of us suggesting changes to one another's 
  poems and the collaborative process was an arm's length one.<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FTP 
  was eventually considered "complete" by summer of 1997. The order is more or 
  less chronological. I'd hoped to tackle as many aspects of the newspaper as 
  possible (but the Sports section defeated me, so I was delighted when Alan dealt 
  with that so effectively!). </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: How do you feel the 
  process of <i>FIT TO PRINT</i> affected your own writing? Would you work with 
  other poets in the future? </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: The collaboration's 
  effect on my own writing is more difficult to express. To have another writer 
  as intensely involved in the same project yet whose work responds to that project 
  differently (and because of that makes one see one's own in a new way) impelled 
  me to test limits more strenuously than ever. By limits I mean the parameters 
  of the project (not all the poems in FTP took the form of the newspaper's double 
  column), and my own "risk taking" insofar as what could work seemed to escalate. 
  That experience has contributed immensely to my subsequent writing. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for working with 
  other poets (or visual artists or videographers or anyone else!), Steve and 
  I haven't abandoned our second attempt at "From a Middle," and I'd welcome the 
  opportunity to collaborate in other situations. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: Can you talk about your 
  new project, <i>At Issue</i>, which is in some ways a continuation of your exploration 
  of print media initiated in <i>FIT TO PRINT</i>? </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: I decided that I wanted 
  to continue working with a form of mass culture (<i>At Issue</i> began while 
  I was still working on <i>FIT TO PRINT </i>-- I write slowly and my projects 
  often overlap). In <i>At Issue</i> I examine the format and contents of the 
  magazine instead of those of the newspaper. The interruptions and syntactical 
  dis-arrangements in <i>At Issue</i> reflect the experience of reading that format 
  (within what is certainly a critical agenda on my part). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>At Issue</i> 
  is a series of poems utilizing the vocabulary and spelling found in magazines 
  of a diverse nature. (An interesting if frightening fact is that there are fewer 
  typos in Vogue than in most scholarly books published in North America!) To 
  counter <i>Vogue</i> I have also been writing through <i>Self</i> (a health/fitness 
  magazine also geared to female readership). As other alternatives I've considered 
  a science journal (perhaps <i>Scientific American</i>), a news magazine, and 
  perhaps a computer-oriented journal. Originally the project was to incorporate 
  four (monthly) magazines at a year's worth of issues, one issue per poem. Having 
  gone through nine issues of American and British <i>Vogue</i> (at time of writing 
  I'm working on the tenth) and four of <i>Self</i> I think that those two magazines 
  will provide the right amount of material and that <i>At Issue</i> will either 
  become a chapbook or a section in another book. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: You hold both British 
  and Canadian citizenship, and have lived in several countries including Zambia 
  and the United States. Do you feel that geography -- or movement between various 
  locales -- has played any part in the development of your aesthetic, or how 
  you view borders (either textual or political)? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: Most of my life has 
  been lived in an "elsewhere." I have access to three citizenships, having been 
  born in what is now Zambia to British/Canadian parents, who lived there only 
  briefly before embarking on what for me became a trans-Atlantic upbringing (I 
  was less than a year old when they returned from Zambia to England). Subsequently, 
  from 1974 to 1982 I lived for varying periods in Mexico, Greece, Italy and the 
  U.S. and there again (in California) in 1989 and 1997. Perhaps more revealingly, 
  between 1989 and 1995 my books were published outside of Canada, even if poems 
  of mine continued to appear in Canadian journals.. Then <i>Marine Snow</i> was 
  published here and the collaboration with Alan Halsey <i>FIT TO PRINT</i>. (The 
  chapbook Multiplex with work by Ron Silliman and myself [not a collaboration] 
  appeared in October 1998 through Wild Honey Press in Ireland.) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don't identify with geography in terms of a sense of 'place' being core to 
  my creativity. Certainly the fact I've lived in many different places (as well 
  as travelling extensively) has contributed to my perception of how and in what 
  ways and degrees 'difference' manifests culturally, politically, personally. 
  I don't think that travelling per se has played any part in how I view textual 
  borders. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: How does gender play 
  out in your writing, and in your view of innovative writing in general? While 
  the appearance of -- and your inclusion in -- such anthologies as <i>Out of 
  Everywhere</i> and <i>Moving Borders</i> suggest that much of today's radical 
  poetry is being produced by women you have also noted the disparity in the ratio 
  of women to men appearing in anthologies both past and contemporary. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: The anthologies <i>Out 
  of Everywhere</i> and <i>Moving Borders</i> (the first published by Reality 
  Street Editions in the U.K., the second by Talsiman in the U.S.) both 'prove' 
  that women are innovative practitioners. I'm keenly aware of the fact that in 
  many English-speaking countries male innovative writers still outnumber women 
  in terms of published work. Certainly there have been discrepancies in past 
  anthologies in both directions (indeed, in gatherings of conventional poetry 
  women might sometimes outnumber men!). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gender is certainly 
  part of my writing (there are differences between women and men and in the way 
  they express themselves creatively or otherwise), and sometimes I deliberately 
  draw attention to this. I've also drawn attention to the fact of difference 
  between languages (for example, the existence of gendered nouns, even in Old 
  English).<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
  me to discover innovative work (writing, visual art, film, video) is a pleasure 
  and if a woman is the artist that adds to my pleasure, but it's not a prerequisite 
  for enjoyment. Nor does the enjoyment diminish if the artist is a man. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: As well as expressing 
  an interest in the nuances and potentialities of language your poetry also exhibits 
  a keen awareness of the page, and how the placement of words alter and/or generate 
  meaning. What are your thoughts on the relation between typography and poetry? 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: I've been fortunate 
  to have worked mostly with publishers/designers who invited and encouraged my 
  participation in the publishing process of each of my books. I've learned from 
  each one of them. <i>Straw Cupid</i> was probably the book I was most actively 
  involved in in terms of design. Maureen Cochrane and I went through every decision 
  and worked through every layout problem together on what was my second publication. 
  But when Chax Press decided to publish <i>Quirks & Quillets</i> (as a trade 
  publication) I wanted Charles Alexander to "surprise" me. (Chax Press's handmade, 
  limited editions are extraordinary.) The proofs were sent to me but beyond that 
  I had no idea what the book would look like (though I encouraged Cynthia Miller 
  to do an original drawing for the cover and I'm delighted with her response 
  to that work. She's also responsible for the artwork on the cover of <i>The 
  Tongue Moves Talk</i>). Texts are always affected by typography, but I'm not 
  a designer, I'm a writer whose projects sometimes require new (for me) ways 
  of thinking about typography and making a text work 'on the page.' (My methods 
  for achieving this aren't necessarily the most expedient, as I learned after 
  the fact about <i>FIT TO PRINT</i>!) </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: How would you characterize 
  the development of your writing from your first work, Nothing by Mouth, to the 
  most recent? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: My early work was an 
  exploration of altering the way we perceive the day-to-day, while allowing "language" 
  to be shown as an entity itself (rather than a transparent vastness through 
  which to "see" our world). This led to an investigation of "sentence effects," 
  particularly the integration of poetic line with prose period. (This was not 
  to enact a conciliatory synthesis of the two genres, but to delineate their 
  radical sympathies and contradictions, i.e. not to write a prose poem, but to 
  reclaim an exploratory usefulness from the sentence, in order to extend the 
  poetic form to more challenging/rewarding modes of readership.) So what began 
  in <i>Quill Driver</i> (1989) as a propositional language, becomes in <i>Marine 
  Snow</i> (1995) a fusion of propositional language with stanzaic configurations 
  (in order to explore phenomenological and social implications in perception, 
  when the latter is mediated through the orthodox and the errant trajectories 
  of language, writing and space). <i>Quirks & Quillets</i> (1991) explores a 
  similar state of mediation but utilizes a different momentum by suppressing 
  the period in favour of a series of brief, intense phrasal continua. For the 
  most part, the writing deliberately avoids punctuation so that grammatical patterns 
  can shift in both their functions and effects. The intention was not to produce 
  an 'abstract' or non-referential text, but to reveal how meaning emerges in 
  the sites of its production. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Tongue Moves Talk</i> (1997) explores the perceptions, misconceptions 
  and current role of the social concept of the "carrier." The poems deliberately 
  repudiate any of the "reader comforts" of familiarity and habituality of normative 
  language. <i>The Tongue Moves Talk </i>establishes a deliberate resistance, 
  structured upon patterns that offer a rigorous positioning of their linguistic 
  materiality. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: How do the somewhat 
  aphoristic statements in your poetry function? (Ex. "Beauty is a cultural decision." 
  [MS]; "Sex is its own conclusion for those who haven't noticed." [TMT]; or, 
  "Take away the page and leave the writing." [QD]). While they are often taken 
  up as the most quotable, or the "actual" expressions of your personal thoughts 
  regarding writing and/or philosophy are they always intended to be so? Are they 
  perhaps stylistic "red herrings" for those readers who tend to gravitate toward 
  any sense of stability in de-centered texts? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: The "somewhat aphoristic 
  statements" that recur become part of the exploration of meaning. "Beauty is 
  a cultural decision." is followed by "All hollow." There's a shift in "Sex is 
  its own conclusion for those who haven't noticed." (A reader can infer that 
  certain people haven't noticed that sex is its own conclusion and/or that that 
  conclusion is only for people who haven't noticed . . .) "Take away the page 
  and leave the writing." might refer to a computer screen and/or it could also 
  imply that writing exists independently of paper. I'm particularly inclined 
  to alignments that disrupt/ destabilize conditioned (or conventional) combinatory 
  meanings and some of these are more (or less) aphoristic, for example, "Begin 
  with four quarters a round-edged coin." is less aphoristic than "Don't covet 
  the past it belongs where it is over." (both from <i>Quill Driver</i>). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meaning" and the 
  weather both change. Why an insistence on the static as a given, in what is 
  anything but a stable environment? Meaning is at once precise for the moment 
  and shifting over time. Consider slang, for example. "Gay" meant something very 
  different for the Victorians than it does for us: a "gay" woman was a prostitute. 
  "Queer" as in 'odd' was in relatively recent usage, if not in North America 
  then in other English-speaking countries. The titles of two of my books both 
  came from slang, <i>Quill Driver</i> means 'writer' (at least eigteenth century, 
  possibly older), and <i>Quirks & Quillets</i> ('tricks and devices') was in 
  use in the sixteenth century). "Bread," as in "out of bread" formerly meant 
  out of work, slightly different from its 1960s meaning (the roots are over two 
  hundred years old). "Pig" referred to a police officer as early as 1811, but 
  who's to guess that "tickle text" refers to a parson? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: Gertrude Stein appears 
  to be a major influence on your writing, but what other figures, either Modern 
  or Contemporary do you view as influential or inspiring? What about LANGUAGE 
  writing? In the "Toronto Since Then" issue of <i>Open Letter</i> (8.8, 1994), 
  Victor Coleman characterized you (and Steve McCaffery) as standing "a lonely 
  watch" over the "paucity of language-centered poetry in Toronto." Is this a 
  fair assessment: do you consider yourself a LANGUAGE poet, does the aesthetic 
  itself require a geographic community (whether that be Vancouver or Buffalo) 
  to be considered a viable force in the literary community (national or international), 
  and has Toronto changed "since then"? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: As to the question 
  regarding L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets and poetry, and my position therein: upper case/equal 
  sign "L" writing encouraged me to recognize and confront my own habits and formulae 
  -- to move on and grow, and I regarded "L" writing as more contemporarily vital 
  than anything else I'd encountered when I came to it in 1982. (As an aside, 
  I read Bataille's Death and Sensuality two years before reading any "L" writing.) 
  But it was through L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writing that I went on to read the work of 
  such modernist poets as Mina Loy and William Empson. Though they are usually 
  overshadowed by the more luminous Joyce, Stein (and my 'favourite' Djuna Barnes, 
  whose <i>Nightwood</i> I read early, when I was sixteen]) their texts for me 
  are of considerable importance. Indeed, I would say that the writing of all 
  of the above-mentioned has influenced my own, though not necessarily in an immediately 
  apparent way. I would also add to the list the French writer Francis Ponge and 
  the Austrian Robert Musil. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think a 
  writer's "position" should require a sharing of 'confidences,' explication of 
  'codes,' divulging of 'experiments' made-on-the-way-to completed works; in short 
  an "explanation," which may or may not benefit those interested. The act of 
  writing is simultaneously intensely personal and historically collective (whether 
  or not the writer is aware of prior works of shared or similar concerns and 
  explorations). This act is separated from the reading of text-on-page through 
  time, and the further removed one is (in time) the more general the context. 
  (Hence our perception of those 'decades,' 'eras,' and 'movements' of our own 
  century [and the many preceding] culminates in such blanket terms as "modernism," 
  "neo-classicism," and "romanticism.") Thus L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writing became LANGUAGE 
  writing becomes language writing . . . I'm not an upper case/equal sign practitioner 
  but the effect on my work is evident. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly Toronto's poetry condition (yes, that's deliberate) has changed since 
  Victor Coleman's 1994 "Toronto Since Then," and geographic communities usually 
  prove to be unstable. Whether or not any version of language writing would ever 
  be considered a "viable force" in any literary context isn't the point as far 
  as I'm concerned. If texts survive because readers continue to find them rewarding 
  in new contexts then that's viable. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SC: You have objected to 
  the term "experimental" in discussing the writing of, for example, Stein, preferring 
  the term "innovative." What is the problem with "experimental," how does "innovative" 
  differ, and where do terms such as "avant-garde" or even "normative writing" 
  fit in your understanding? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KMC: Even today we live 
  with the troubling term "avant-garde,"a word so familiarthat it's used without 
  giving the meaning much thought. Most of the writers I know want no part of 
  the "garde" even in some distant future, so being slotted into the "avant-garde" 
  makes for an uncomfortable mis/fit. Others accept this term as a badge or indicator 
  of their work being outside of the norm. Some prefer (and embrace) the soubriquet 
  "experimental," if anything even more misleading, or as the late B.S. Johnson 
  so aptly put it: </font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">I object to the word experimental 
    being applied to my own work. Certainly I make experiments, but the unsuccessful 
    ones are quietly hidden away and what I choose to publish is in my terms successful: 
    that is, it has been the best way I could find of solving particular writing 
    problems. Where I depart from convention, it is because the convention has 
    failed, is inadequate for what I have to say. The relevant questions are surely 
    whether each device works or not, whether it achieves what it set out to achieve, 
    and how less good were the alternatives. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Elsewhere, John Cage has 
  written: </font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The word experimental 
    is apt, providing it is understood not as descriptive of an act to be later 
    judged in terms of success and failure, but simply as an act the outcome of 
    which is not known. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If a writer, or any other 
  artist for that matter, applies the term "experimental" to an unknown result 
  in a public context then how can one suspend evaluation? If the various and 
  numerous acts the outcome of which "is not known," were to be combined with 
  an absence-of-evaluation then the recurring result would frequently be one of 
  mediocrity (at best) Without experimentation no 'new' results would be forthcoming, 
  but I concur with Johnson that one's unsuccessful experiments should remain 
  privately hidden away. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we arrive at "formally innovative" or even "formally investigative" as alternatives 
  to the outmoded or inappropriate terms still applied to writing practices regarded 
  as variously "new" today. At this point "innovative" seems just as much a label 
  of convenience as any other but it signals a more positive (for me) sense of 
  departure from "normative writing." <BR>
