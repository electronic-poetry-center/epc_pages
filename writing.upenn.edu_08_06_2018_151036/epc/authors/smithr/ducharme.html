        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In this 
          his first full length collection, Rod Smith mixes his modes, switching&#151; 
          often at lightning speed&#151; from the wryly intimate to the linguistically 
          playful, from the humorous to the &quot;abstract.&quot; If the latter 
          mode seems dominant here at a cursory glance, then I fear <i>In Memory 
          of My Theories</i> might be too easily labeled &quot;second generation 
          Language Poetry.&quot; That would be too bad&#151; for Smith's best 
          work interestingly resists the generic confines of that territory. While 
          it frequently makes use of what seems a hard core &quot;language&quot; 
          style (&quot;unfold stem of contraction sift, as at the top and the 
          bottom of&quot;), what may be more easily overlooked is that this mode 
          is adulterated from the very start with a tone reminiscent of Frank 
          O'Hara's &quot;personal&quot; poems (&quot;Lee Ann says 'Oh Rod, you're 
          so dire'/ She's not documenting any conquests/ but it doesn't originate 
          in a brochure&quot;).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is 
          no accident then that the title of the book is a play on the title of 
          O'Hara's &quot;In Memory of My Feelings.&quot; Smith's book ironizes 
          O'Haraesque idealism, while being a little mistrustfully nostalgic, 
          one thinks, for the artistic &quot;grace&quot; which such idealism seemed 
          to allow the poet. (&quot;The degree of mistrust/ magnifies the measure 
          of abstraction./ <i>The lightning is an exaggeration of the light</i>.&quot;)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The allusion 
          to O'Hara is also apt in the sense of O'Hara's association with so called 
          &quot;personal&quot; poetry, a term he coined. In Smith's relaxed version 
          of personism&#151;&amp; in contrast to what O'Hara claimed for his own 
          work&#151; the poet seems to want the writing to be BOTH between two 
          persons and two pages. If Smith does not allow the reader to forget 
          that the poem is made of words, neither does he entirely allow us to 
          forget that it is a particular person who made it (&quot;Words// have// 
          an/ ancestor&quot;). Where there is an &quot;I&quot; in Smith's poetry, 
          it is not an Eliotic mask, much less the &quot;detached&quot; I familiar 
          to readers of, for example, Michael Palmer or Ron Silliman (&quot;Why 
          does Ron Silliman hate Shakespeare&quot;). If Smith's &quot;I&quot; 
          is not always exactly &quot;Rod Smith&quot; either, a poetics of gesture 
          lurks, sometimes awkwardly, beneath some of Smith's most austere constructs 
          (&quot;Plants/ to have been/ melancholic/ pavement.&quot;)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Smith 
          posits a &quot;cranial/ cynicism which/ creased in mince is need.&quot; 
          If we do not readily notice that he here equates an intellectualism 
          (&quot;cranial/ cynicism&quot;) with &quot;need&quot; or feeling, it 
          is in part because his L=A=N=G U=A=G=E like flourishes distract our 
          attention from the grammatical function of the statement. Yet it is 
          also because of the &quot;opposition&quot; of intellect to feeling- 
          what Eliot called the dissociation of sensibility- yet so far ingrained 
          as to constitute a received, &amp; therefore suspect, formula. Smith's 
          work trashes the impasse between Theory and Feeling, by readmitting 
          a razor quick <i>playfulness</i> into poetic diction (&quot;Gun profit. 
          Gun nug. Gun lung. Hung grug. Gun from. Gun Moynihan.&quot;)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If such 
          a poetic refuses the split between intellect and feeling, it also participates 
          in the postlanguage reexamination of theory in the wake of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E 
          moment. The title of Smith's book is a joke&#151; much as the title 
          of O'Hara's poem was ironic; for how can one lose one's theories. Furthermore, 
          we hardly imagine Smith as a theorist; any pretense otherwise seems 
          to be blown apart by the title of just one short poem here, &quot;Bad 
          Ashbery But Fun.&quot; Yet the dissociation of sensibility, in this 
          case, between &quot;Theories&quot; and &quot;Fun&quot; is immediately 
          problematized by the poem itself:</font></p>

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">From its 
          opening line this poem posits (enacts) a poiesis of intellect conjoined 
          to the &quot;everyday&quot;, the public &amp; private as a complex exchange 
          (&quot;A little civil thinking&quot;), rather than simply in opposition. 
          In Smith's collapse of the public/private dichotomy, the anarchic replaces 
          an implied socialism of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets as a political means, 
          less of critique, than of uniting theory to practice. In the counter 
          utopian world of this poem, the &quot;charming president&quot; is equated 
          with the speaker, comically announcing his freedom to &quot;go home/ 
          Turn the sprinkler on// and lay down in the mud.&quot; (The &quot;freedom&quot; 
          announced is also comic/ineffectual because of its limits: one is &quot;free&quot; 
          to do what one pleases, so long as what one pleases does not threaten 
          the reproduction of the economic &amp; political order). Here, the ends 
          of inquiry are gently torqued into the numinous. The &quot;you&quot; 
          is found less culpable for an outcome than &quot;not guilty&quot; of 
          &quot;a non accident,&quot; because, finally, the inhering structures 
          of power have become irrelevant: what at first appeared &quot;a lyric 
          kingdom&quot; turns out, happily, to be only &quot;a musical event.&quot; 
          It is in this actuated state of &quot;musical event&quot; where the 
          &quot;Bad Ashbery&quot; is found to be of some value (&quot;Fun&quot;?), 
          after all. Smith's apparent anarchism sidesteps canonical sanctity &amp; 
          stigmas about &quot;imitation,&quot; even as it ignores tidy poetic 
          prescriptions. Rather than rejecting the &quot;opacity&quot; of the 
          L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E moment out of hand, Smith adapts its poetic vehicle 
          to his own needs, achieving a quirky balance between Zukofskyan lower 
          &amp; upper limits. Rod Smith's poetics of &quot;Theories&quot; moderated 
          by &quot;Feelings&quot; freshens the space between reader &amp; poem, 
          making us think (again)- if only for an instant- about the meanings 
          of that complex exchange.</font></p>
