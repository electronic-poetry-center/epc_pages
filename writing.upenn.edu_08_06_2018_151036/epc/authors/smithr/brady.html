        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
          rereading Rod Smith's work in preparation for this visit, I ran across 
          these lines in his collection, &quot;The Lack&quot; (published as issue 
          no. 104 of <i>A.BACUS</i>):</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Lisa says,<br>
          &quot;stupid,<br>
          but in a useful way&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Now, while 
          I wouldn't take these lines at all to characterize Smith's poetry, I 
          would maintain that they have something &quot;useful&quot; to say about 
          the materials out of which that poetry is made. These materials register 
          most often as a collection or collage of specialized and disciplinary, 
          that is to say ideological, discourses and vocabularies. The political 
          economy of language whose circuits we name, perhaps disingenuously, 
          &quot;the world,&quot; requires the mutual self-closure of these disciplinary 
          languages as prior condition of their status as objects for our knowledge. 
          For confirmation of this, one need only think of the enforced mutual 
          incomprehension of those speaking the various languages of &quot;hard&quot; 
          science, political critique, institutional administration, lyric poetry, 
          and urban solid waste disposal. Any language thus self-enclosed against 
          the encroachments of any other language is constantly bombarded by the 
          sound of its own founding presuppositions. The effect of such bombardment 
          over any considerable length of time -- and how long have we existed 
          with compartmental specialization as our model of an &quot;advanced 
          division of labor?&quot; -- the effect of such bombardment is flatly 
          stupefying. Its elaboration as social policy -- as &quot;the world&quot; 
          -- is irrsponsible, terrifying, and stupid.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, what 
          could possibly be &quot;useful&quot; about such a depressing state of 
          affairs? The answer proposed by Rod Smith's work is that these languages, 
          in their insularity and mutual exclusion, have given only cursory thought 
          to self-justification and defensive posturing vis-a-vis one another. 
          Brought into proximity, they do not yet know how to defend themselves, 
          or to claim a legislative prerogative over the zone of their interface. 
          The faith (if I might call it such) which animates Smith's poetry lies 
          in this excluded middle between the various and variously technical 
          languages of our contemporaneity -- as the at least partial lack of 
          a predetermined social contract which would settle once and for all 
          the question of mutual obligations. It's as if one might participate 
          in a conversation or confrontation between particle physicists, political 
          dissidents, business administrators, poets and sanitation workers in 
          which literally everything remained at stake.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This confrontation 
          takes place at the level of semantic and ideological &quot;content,&quot; 
          but also and especially at the level of poetic form. Characteristic 
          of Smith's work is an asymmetry of local structure: narrative sentences 
          abut lines in which parts of speech put each other on as masks, and 
          this spills over into passages of serial &quot;nouning,&quot; in which 
          the only grammatical guarantee is that one word = one word. This isn't 
          simply the problematic claim to &quot;poetic language,&quot; in which 
          form models the world's potential coherence only at the cost of an essential 
          remove from that world. Smith's lexicon persists in various states of 
          indexical, metonymic, or emblematic relation to its various social and 
          ideological &quot;sources.&quot; Here composition addresses itself to 
          phoneme, morpheme, and ideologeme as possibly equivalent, and often 
          coextensive, terms -- the argument of syntax is thus explicitly an argument 
          in the dialogic sense: a dispute. If one task for a socially-engaged 
          poetry is, to borrow a line or two from Smith's work, the consideration 
          of &quot;the world as a whole in its / relation to that which is not 
          the world -- form,&quot; then Smith writes that relation as not only 
          analogical, but also anagrammatic (a literal rearrangement of parts) 
          and analeptic -- or, to borrow a privileged term from last week's visitor, 
          allen Fisher -- curative.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thus, 
          an art-practice, not of avant-gardist rejection and refusal, but of 
          sustained engagement and confrontation. Such a confrontation -- in which, 
          as I've said, everything remains at stake -- exposes one's thought and 
          poetry to a double risk: that, on the one hand, it might heighten only 
          the &quot;merely&quot; frivolous moments of incongruity in which discourses 
          fail to speak to one another; that, on the other, it might find itself 
          witness to nothing but the atrocity and terror by which one language 
          effaces or consumes another, as all too often happens when the discourses 
          of administration &quot;confront&quot; the resistant sounds and silences 
          of human bodies. That Smith's poetry recognizes these risks, and recognizes 
          its own tenuous position in the provisional spaces between such extreme 
          possibilities, is signalled by a collection like <i>In Memory of My 
          Theories</i>, whose opening poem begins with &quot;your goofy fremitus&quot; 
          and ends with &quot;the terrible / silent excess of tortured imputation.&quot;</font></p>
