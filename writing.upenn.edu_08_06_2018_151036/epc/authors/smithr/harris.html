          <i>The Good House</i>,<br>
          A Spectacular Book, 2001 <br>
          </b> </p>
        <p>In American literature the house without a foundation is an all too 
          common theme. Houses tend to remain unfinished or temporary affairs, 
          liable to break apart at any moment and leave their residents with a 
          pile of rubble. In &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; Poe's 
          narrator finds himself at a loss to name the thing that unsettles him 
          about the Usher house: &quot;There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening 
          of the heart&#151;an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading 
          of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was 
          it&#151;I paused to think&#151;what was it that so unnerved me in the 
          contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; 
          nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as 
          I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, 
          that while, beyond doubt, there <i>are</i> combinations of very simple 
          natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the 
          analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It 
          was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the 
          particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient 
          to modify, or perhaps to annihilate, its capacity for sorrowful impression&#133;&quot;<font color="#666666"><b>1</b></font> 
          The narrator's claim that truth lies &quot;beyond our depth,&quot; does 
          not keep him from imagining that a better description of the situation 
          will release him from the power the house holds over him. The narrator 
          needs a better story about the Usher house than he can obtain from an 
          exterior and reflective position, so he proceeds into the house to check 
          on its inhabitants. The famous conclusion finds the narrator, having 
          come face to face with the unnamable &quot;malady&quot; of the siblings, 
          hightailing it from the scene. &quot;My brain reeled as I saw the mighty 
          walls rushing asunder&#151;there was a long tumultuous shouting sound 
          like the voice of a thousand waters&#151;and the deep and dank tarn 
          at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the 'House 
          of Usher.'&quot;<font color="#666666"><b>2</b></font> These fragments 
          are never quite put back together again, at least not with any permanence 
          or dependability. Somehow whatever architecture an American writer dreams 
          up, its shelter is temporary, and it soon breaks into fragments (or 
          smithereens, to hint at where I am going with all this). In William 
          Dean Howells's <i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i>, the protagonist's fortunes 
          will &quot;rise&quot; and he will set upon building a magnificent house 
          for himself and his family, until, with his fortune falling, he inadvertently 
          sets the unfinished house on fire and it burns to the ground. Henry 
          James and Toni Morrison famously draw up houses that are haunted by 
          an unresolved past. A writer who stays inside the house comes to be 
          viewed as pathological; Emily Dickinson continues to be categorized 
          as an agoraphobic who is afraid to leave the security of her own home. 
          American writers tend to value the experience of heading off for new 
          places, being an expatriate, or being on the road.</p>
        <p><br>
          In his latest creation <i>The Good House</i>, Washington, D.C. resident 
          and late thirty-something poet Rod Smith canvasses a 21st century house 
          with an architecture of his own design. I mention the forebears to indicate 
          how strange it is that a long poem devoted to the house should suddenly 
          appear, much less promise to show readers what the <i>good</i> house 
          is made up of. The constructive activity that it promises not only runs 
          headstrong against previous literary houses that fared so poorly; it 
          also runs against the postmodern celebration of the fragmentary and 
          the refusal of metaphysical frameworks, restrictive and exclusionary 
          structures, and so on. But suddenly in a period populated largely by 
          literary nomads, there comes a poem that stakes its claim on something 
          as basic as a roof over one's head. Yet I'm also being cheeky here because 
          <i>The Good House</i> never settles on an architecture that is fixed 
          once and for all. The constructive activity derives its energy from 
          the tonal and semantic multiplicity of the title; by iterating the &quot;good 
          house&quot; or simply &quot;good&quot; or &quot;house&quot; alone (as 
          well as further variations) the poem fans out into rhythmical fragments 
          just as it fans out into architectural fragments. Perhaps it's less 
          accurate to characterize this as constructive activity than to say Smith 
          <i>sounds</i> out the good house:</p>

             </pre>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The book has a lightness due to its lyrical phrase, &quot;the good 
          house,&quot; which Smith varies in each poem, often in completely dissimilar 
          ways. &quot;In a quiet house / In a house which is very quiet / Where 
          the brackish tandem brooks / the loons.&quot; Although I'm frequently 
          at a loss to say what these eclectic descriptors mean when joined together, 
          maybe that's not the point. It's more accurate to say acoustical principles 
          govern the formal arrangement of the poem. The first line and second 
          lines are easy enough to follow: &quot;a quiet house,&quot; augmented 
          by, &quot;a house which is very quiet.&quot; Then the third and fourth 
          lines, &quot;brackish tandem brooks / the loons,&quot; although I hazard 
          to guess what they mean, are nonetheless clearly intent on sounded parallels: 
          &quot;br,&quot; long &quot;a,&quot; &quot;k,&quot; &quot;oo,&quot; and 
          &quot;s.&quot; Smith's insight is to connect this repetition to the 
          protean structure of the good house itself. &quot;Each reasonable house 
          / &amp; each waking motion / are votive, based on / the wiley resurgence 
          / of awaiting worlds.&quot; Each poem is a &quot;waking,&quot; or &quot;wiley 
          resurgence&quot; that sounds out the good house once more.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Although composed as a long poem, the modest edition now out from Spectacular 
          Books prints a variable number of entries per page, thereby giving the 
          entire work a foreshortened feel. Were there a whole page devoted to 
          each of the 70+ entries then it would better illustrate the fact that 
          each single entry is a poem in itself. <i>The Good House</i> in its 
          current edition is a throwback to the small press operated out of the 
          garage. It's dimensions are a deceptively slim 8&frac12;&quot; by 11&quot; 
          page folded along the vertical center and stapled with a stiff cover. 
          The cover's &quot;hand-fashioned&quot; imprint, created by artist-poet 
          David Larson, bears the title and Smith's name in stenciled letters 
          (a bit like a homemade protest sign), with a bird flying off to one 
          side. The blacked-out letters use some kind of thick paint with a course 
          texture. It reminds me of the stuff on skateboards called &quot;grip.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>At the beginning of the poem Smith appears to seek assistance from 
          a muse, and supporting this view is the fact that he gives it thanks 
          and bids it farewell at the end. In this sense the poem adheres to the 
          traditional model of asking higher beings for guidance and inspiration-except 
          that for Smith the muse is an <i>egret</i>. We first hear the egret 
          in two poems placed before &quot;The Good House&quot; itself begins. 
          The repetition of &quot;egret&quot; is like a preparation or warm-up, 
          for it augurs the repetition of the &quot;good house&quot; that follows:<br>
        </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <pre><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">egret lights, they stretch, &amp; revere, they say
i have a thing,
instruct in the new circumstance, elliptical,
tangible, to their sweet ego, in open-heart &amp;
patagonia, go beyond shy in time they gain
&amp; haunt, let's say
the word of the egret is
thumb, let's say thumb
as an egret prelude then, in order to correctly translate sapho, &amp;
            think the cluster-egret&#133; </font>
             </pre>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The business of the egret is to &quot;instruct in the new circumstance,&quot; 
          as for instance when the &quot;word&quot; of the egret is &quot;thumb&quot; 
          and suddenly the poem is intoxicated by &quot;let's say thumb.&quot; 
          I get the impression that the egret is teaching Smith to sing, as confirmed 
          a few lines later when these various elements draw together in a new 
          combination, &quot;education of sweet ego thumb.&quot; But what is a 
          sweet ego thumb? Again, it seems that acoustics govern the lines more 
          than semantics. Egret and ego share the same sound and thus can play 
          off each other. For my ears the closest sounding word to egret is <i>regret</i>, 
          but that word appears nowhere in the poem. Yet given later passages 
          that dip into tones of lament (and are perhaps best characterized as 
          a dirge), I think it's plausible to associate the egret with regret&#151;imagine 
          &quot;egret&quot; as &quot;regret&quot; with the &quot;r&quot; gulped 
          down. It's also plausible the egret has migrated into Smith's composition 
          from another poet's work, namely Lisa Jarnot's poetry of small animals 
          with striking names, such as the chinchilla.<br>
        </p>
        <p>One of the pleasures of <i>The Good House</i> is to follow the lines 
          as they reach back to earlier writers and then reach forward in startling 
          transformations. At one point we read, &quot;anything can be made out 
          of a house,&quot; which seems to play off Williams Carlos Williams who 
          said, &quot;a poem can be made out of anything.&quot; In Smith's version, 
          the availability of anything for a poem now becomes the availability 
          of a house for anything. But consider the precarious situation Smith 
          thus proposes. For when anything can be used, then anything can happen, 
          and there is no guarantee the outcome will be better and not worse. 
          <i>The Good House</i> promises the good but knows full well that its 
          pursuit is uncertain and the consequences are unpredictable. It knows 
          for instance that the authority of the &quot;good&quot; can be too easily 
          claimed: &quot;The good house gave away a certain / sincerity. It got 
          bought up. But / the ravages of equality rack it&#151; / not unforced, 
          not unburied, the good house or murmur / / displays its living air / 
          &amp; punted, rides / the miracles, foamy&#151;&quot; The good house 
          has been bought up, it has been &quot;punted&quot; around, but in the 
          face of these negations ( &quot;not unforced, not unburied&quot;), the 
          poem still seeks a &quot;murmur&quot; or &quot;miracles.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p>The play on Williams's line is an example of one of Smith's characteristic 
          techniques, which he elsewhere describes as a &quot;good-natured ribbing&quot;: 
          &quot;The spatial, unimpeded persistence of the playfully plagiarized 
          trance-state (a good-natured ribbing)&#151;can remark if not remake 
          details of clever word-play (the emptiness of emptiness!) into a discovery 
          of highly peculiar presence.&quot;<b><font color="#666666">3</font></b> 
          For Smith, playing with a quotation is a double-sided gesture. It functions 
          as both deferential act and ironic counterpoint, and interpreting these 
          moments can be tricky. Consider another example of Barrett Watten saying 
          &quot;Identity is the cause of wars,&quot; which in Smith's rendition 
          becomes a poem called, &quot;Identity is the cause of warts.&quot;<b><font color="#666666">4</font></b> 
          One effect of Smith's rendition is to make Watten's critique of identity 
          much more memorable, and thus the playfulness could be interpreted as 
          a supportive gesture, though admittedly a peculiar one. On the other 
          hand, &quot;warts&quot; could be read as dismissing the critical purchase 
          of any theories having to do with identity, and thus it could be interpreted 
          as a contentious gesture. There is such a strong appeal to the idea 
          that there should be struggles between successive &quot;generations&quot; 
          of avant-garde poets, that it's possible Smith's playfulness could be 
          taken as entirely antagonistic. What is Smith trying to say about Watten's 
          work? A safe guess can by made by recalling that <i>Aerial,</i> the 
          magazine edited by Smith, had a special issue devoted to Watten's work-which 
          would remove any doubt that &quot;warts&quot; is not a friendly homage. 
          Still, matters get more complicated if one considers that Smith acknowledges 
          Watten's statement but does not actually acknowledge the critical apparatus 
          that it depends on. The substitution of &quot;warts&quot; for &quot;wars&quot; 
          takes the fire out of Watten's highly provocative line. Smith's rendition 
          manages to be supportive while at the same time it posits a distance 
          between them. To take a slightly different example, Smith once read 
          a poem called &quot;They Beat Me Over a Head With a Turtle: After Cavalcanti,&quot; 
          which riffs on Anslem Berrigan's <i>They Beat Me Over the Head with 
          a Sack</i>.<b><font color="#666666">5</font></b> Berrigan's title is 
          already wry, so there is no fire to be taken out of it, (unless one 
          takes seriously the violent image of getting hit over the head with 
          a sack). But Smith makes the title even more wry (&quot;the emptiness 
          of emptiness&quot;) by transforming it into an overt piece of comedy-indeed 
          the audience laughter can be heard loud and clear on the event recording. 
          Here the good-natured ribbing entails a <i>shared</i> critical apparatus, 
          if I can call it that, by which I mean the sharp wit that Smith and 
          Berrigan have at their disposal.<br>
        </p>
        <p>My sense is that all of these are deferential acts, and that up until 
          now, these acts have contributed greatly to defining the nature, as 
          well as the appeal, of Smith's compositional style. Yet if this is the 
          case, then consider that comedic measures are dropped down a notch in 
          <i>The Good House</i>. Certainly there continue to be lines borrowed 
          from other writers, such as the Williams quotation, and certainly there 
          are unexpected punch lines that show Smith's wit has not diminished 
          in the least. But Smith seems to be moving into different territory 
          with <i>The Good House</i>. Here things are palpably more intimate, 
          even tender. The good-natured ribbing, when it does occur, is aimed 
          less at getting a laugh than at expressing gratitude toward avant-garde 
          practitioners who make it possible to think with greater critical insight 
          than would otherwise be conceivable. As Smith says in a piece written 
          for a collection of recent poetics, &quot;we do not need, but rather 
          already have, a poetics that is a constellatory &amp; innate reflection 
          on the intervention, the LIFE, we embody. Affirmation of this is fact 
          &amp; political act&quot; (&quot;A Tract,&quot; 403). Thus in <i>The 
          Good House</i> one finds a line standing by itself, &quot;perhaps this 
          is a rescue fantasy,&quot; which points the reader to the entirety of 
          Heather Fuller's book of the same name.<br>
        </p>
        <p>It's worth noting that this practice goes both ways. If the name &quot;Rod&quot; 
          pops up in a poetry book from the last few years, then Smith is sure 
          to be the one in mind. I've stumbled across allusions to Rod in Tina 
          Darragh's <i>Dream Rim Instructions</i> (&quot;Rod Smith's Dream House&quot;), 
          Heather Fuller's Dovecoat (&quot;3 Urban Legends&quot;), Rob Fitterman's 
          <i>Metropolis 15-29</i> (&quot;25: A National History of Popular Music 
          and Letters, Vol. 1.&quot;), and Jean Donnelly's <i>Anthem</i> (&quot;Anthem&quot;). 
          Lee Ann Brown, Bill Luoma, and Lisa Jarnot have collaborated with Smith 
          on different projects. For a Philly Talks, Bruce Andrews disassembled 
          Smith's poems in his idiosyncratic close reading practice called &quot;Tips 
          for Totalizers.&quot; With all these nods and hellos, it seems almost 
          a mania for these poets that keep naming each other. But it's important 
          to recognizes that such gestures foreground the mutually invested, even 
          collaborative discourse within which each of the individual creations 
          becomes intelligible.<b><font color="#666666">7</font></b> <br>
        </p>
        <p>If one surveys Smith's career since his first works in the late eighties, 
          it's possible to see a gradual softening of antagonism towards the larger 
          embodiments of power, and in its place, the adoption of a more intimate 
          vantage for critique. An earlier work such as &quot;CIA Sentences&quot; 
          uses non-intentional techniques similar to work by John Cage, (who is 
          perhaps the most important influence on Smith's work). But whereas Cage 
          typically subjected literary texts to his procedures, Smith chose books 
          that were purchased by the CIA from bookstores where he worked during 
          this time. In &quot;CIA Sentences&quot; the results are rollickingly 
          funny, but with a sharp edge. Over the next few years Smith would move 
          away from procedural forms, but the humor would continue to be a dominant 
          characteristic. What's curious, then, is that for the most part <i>The 
          Good House</i> shirks away from outright humor. Granted, there are humorous 
          moments such as one entry, &quot;Excuse me officer, I thought / you 
          were a shape-shifting rat,&quot; that echoes like Smith's earlier, more 
          overt political barbs. Yet overall the feeling that I am left with after 
          reading <i>The Good House</i> is one of tremendous sincerity, even intimacy. 
          The work is visceral such that its critical energy comes from the gut. 
          Perhaps the safest thing to say about the &quot;the shape-shifting rat&quot; 
          is that it is used more effectively in the present work because it comes 
          unexpectedly, as if we should not be too lulled by the softer lyrics 
          that make up the majority of the poem:<br>
        </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <pre><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">the honesty of the house helps
the people to know &#151; they can
relax &amp; recall other houses
they have known, they become
simple &amp; listen to each other
&amp; to some birds, the birds right now</font>
             </pre>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One of the most striking features of <i>The Good House</i>, then, is 
          that it puts tremendous weight on its feelings, and here the poem finds 
          an affinity with recent works that restore the place of affect to avant-garde 
          practice. I am thinking of Stacy Doris's <i>Paramour</i> and Nada Gordon 
          and Gary Sullivan's <i>Swoon</i>, as well as several others. In Smith's 
          poem, affect defines the relation of subject to world. This differs 
          from the modernist precursor whose desire to order the world entails 
          a position of mastery and self-superiority. This differs, too, from 
          the cerebral postmodernist whose irony keeps the world at a safe distance. 
          In <i>The Good House</i> there is an intense desire to be affect-ed 
          by the world that one inhabits&#151;<br>

        <p>During a recent interview with Patrick Durgin, Smith explained his 
          idea of a &quot;Feeled Poem,&quot; taking a miscue from the open field 
          poetics associated with Black Mountain: &quot;I've not yet written my 
          feeled poem panegyric but it's one of my favorite submodern genres, 
          &amp; a favored form of the more radically inclined of the new mannerist 
          school. I suppose the feeled poetry I like best has a certain turtlist 
          sensibility, which many think is a joke.&quot;<font color="#666666"><b>9</b></font> 
          Maybe <i>The Good House</i> is the realization of this &quot;feeled 
          poem panegryic.&quot; For Robert Duncan, Charles Olson and many other 
          poets associated with Black Mountain, an open field relates to the formal 
          composition of a poem with the idea that an open or projective form 
          releases greater energy than a traditional closed form. For Smith, feeling 
          allows for a peculiar interconnectivity among things in the world he 
          inhabits. The allusion to &quot;turtilist sensibility&quot; is not necessarily 
          a &quot;joke&quot; and even foreshadows Smith's current work, especially 
          if one considers that a turtle carries its house on its own body. A 
          turtle is low to the ground, close to things, not at all high and flighty, 
          athletic or attractive. In how many children's cartoons does the comedy 
          revolve around a turtle that is naked and exposed when its shell is 
          stolen? Smith's poem would say the shell is always precarious, but that 
          this is advantageous for it demonstrates the necessity of a reconnecting 
          with world that one inhabits. Or as Smith says in &quot;What was Turtlism,&quot; 
          he prefers not a duality between presence and absence but rather a third 
          term that would be &quot;a flight <i>back to presence</i>.&quot;<b><font color="#666666">10</font></b> 
          Here is a noteworthy conjunction with Walter Benjamin in <i>The Arcades 
          Project</i>: &quot;The original form of all dwelling is existence not 
          in the house but in the shell. The shell bears the impression of its 
          occupant. In the most extreme instance, the dwelling becomes a shell.&quot;<b><font color="#666666">11</font></b> 
          Call <i>The Good House</i> the extreme instance of being a shell but 
          then asking how to achieve contact once more. <br>
        </p>
        <p>What is remarkable is that the poem is more than willing to sacrifice 
          its own claims, which suggests the degree of vulnerability the good 
          house must possess. One of the most unforgettable lines reads, &quot;If 
          the house is just poetry / we're in trouble.&quot; Smith does not want 
          his poem to be kidnapped by its own aesthetics, or by anyone else's, 
          however politically attractive they might be. &quot;The good house / 
          summers on Long Island, reads / Debord, &amp; rests / like a scythe&#133;&quot; 
          One passage suggests the good house must be built on the memories, sounds, 
          and words of others&#151;<br>

        </blockquote>
        <p>The passage speaks to the difficult perception of nondescript things. 
          While &quot;some stuff&quot; might be seen during the course of everyday 
          chores and while it might regularly occupy our direct line of vision, 
          our habits are such that it does not otherwise merit attention. Sometimes 
          one <i>wonders </i>about the <i>wonderbread</i> wrapper, sometimes one 
          doesn't <i>wonder</i> about much at all. Smith definitely wonders about 
          the nondescript things, for they indicate a social world &quot;outside&quot; 
          the good house, but which the house is shot through with at every corner. 
          They attest to the openness of the house, not its closure against whatever 
          lies beyond its walls. In fact a &quot;stack of bad news&quot; gestures 
          to the presence of Smith's own <i>home</i>, Washington, DC, which according 
          to recent statistics is the U.S. city with the highest percentage of 
          newspaper readers.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The main thing that vexes any conception of the &quot;good&quot; or 
          of the &quot;house&quot; (or dwelling, inhabitation, or related philosophical 
          formulations) is the inevitability of exclusion. Can the fact that the 
          good house has been given a dizzying array of provisional and open-ended 
          descriptions avoid granting the advantage to some, while sending others 
          out into the cold? By invoking its very name, the good house skates 
          dangerously close to the &quot;good life,&quot; and no theory of the 
          latter has ever been successful in negotiating the ambiguity between 
          life with a big <i>L</i> and life with a little <i>l</i>. Invariably 
          an empowered class enjoys the former, while all the rest are consigned 
          to the latter. Perhaps it's precisely this ambiguity that leads Smith 
          to construct a house that is never finished, that is perpetually exposed 
          and open. In the expository section of his manifesto, &quot;A Tract,&quot; 
          Smith writes, &quot;I am clearly arguing for a privileging of the site 
          of cognition&#133;. A location of/as process which is areal (rather 
          than surreal). Arreal because no context is finite, whether internal 
          or external. It seems to me that when one places such an emphasis, the 
          contingency, &amp; constructedness of the thought process becomes, well, 
          'clear' / Or say any context is finite due only to our own limitations, 
          our cognitive limits&#151;<i>inherently</i>, however, any context is 
          infinite&#133; &quot; (&quot;A Tract,&quot; 401). Smith never says what 
          the house ultimately <i>is</i>, because that would be to purify it of 
          whatever is not yet housed under its roof, which according to &quot;A 
          Tract,&quot; must always be infinite, therefore uncontainable. The problem 
          then becomes whether the good house succeeds in making itself not a 
          question of <i>being</i> but rather of <i>infinity</i>. My hunch is 
          to answer this by looking for moments in the poem that speak to awakening, 
          waiting, exposure, or even vulnerability&#151;moments of transformation 
          or becoming. These moments, some of which have been mentioned above, 
          are what I am left contemplating after reading the poem. To give one 
          more example, Smith's use of the word &quot;house&quot; continually 
          destabilizes itself by using both its noun and verb form. The very first 
          poem reads, &quot;The good houses the parts, calls to / them, &amp; 
          wakens&#151;.&quot; And a later poem reads, &quot;the house seems / 
          to be a verb though it dislikes / the term 'housing'&#133;&quot; The 
          objection to &quot;housing&quot; is that it transforms a verb into a 
          noun; Smith wants it the other way around, from noun to active verb. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>The good house tells us that its nature rests not so much in one fixed 
          structure that has been suffocated by the multiple layers and glosses 
          of essentially the same thing, but rather the good house is up for ongoing 
          reconstruction. &quot;There are 8 houses in the heart,/ there should 
          be 9.&quot; By locating the house &quot;in the heart,&quot; Smith circumscribes 
          the barrenness of a finite interiority. The favored punctuation mark 
          is the abbreviated &quot;&amp;&quot; which suggests accumulative as 
          opposed to synthetic activity. Instead of a unifying perspective on 
          the house, the poem grants the reader an outlook of &quot;attentions 
          multiplied.&quot; This is Smith's goal, as he writes elsewhere, &quot;The 
          crush of Only Capitalism throws us back on ourselves, meaning each other. 
          The horror of that it has created us &amp; the possibility of a being 
          other than it rests within attentions multiplied&#151;the measures escaped 
          into 'harmony,' unlistened (im)penetrant amaterial sense mechanism of 
          the several sharing cares, forwarded or lent-out. The personal as overstructure&#151;&quot; 
          (&quot;A Tract,&quot; 403). Perhaps the &quot;overstructure&quot; of 
          the good house can only be truly &#151; if it is never closed. The house 
          is never finished, because it knows that current historical circumstances 
          mitigate against any roof that could accommodate everyone who would 
          live in it. Thus one line declares, &quot;time is a housed reputable 
          beginner // thirty more are needed.&quot; The good house is contingent 
          on hard-won moments that force it to seek a new active form, hard-won 
          because it must keep discovering a way out from its habitual forms.

          7. One might also here stress the importance of Smith's efforts in the 
          distribution of poetry and related materials through his regular announcements 
          of new titles to the Buffalo Poetics List. These are issued from Bridge 
          Street Books, the bookstore that Smith manages in D.C. It's central 
          location aside (right in the nation's center of power), the emails provide 
          an indispensable service for the increasingly global readership of small 
          presses, and an incomparable service in allowing access to those works 
          beyond the insular locales of major cities on the U.S. coasts or a bare 
          handful of universities. Each new book or magazine is listed with one 
          quotation or a brief comment, and these snippets are frequently all 
          the marketing it will get. Unless it already has a reputation, the book 
          is left in Smith's hands to generate wider interest. If ever there were 
          a redemptive form of advertising, I suppose this one&#151;stemming from 
          an alternative purchasing community&#151;would qualify. The emails might 
          be even be understood as an extension of the poet's radio show (think 
          Pound, Creeley, S. Howe, Bernstein, Andrews, Goldsmith, and probably 
          more I am forgetting) in which the poet creates space for alternative 
          networks of exchange, but in which the poet has a direct hand in programming. 
          In the very first email Smith described the inception of the idea, &quot;It 
          was suggested to me that I periodically select 5 or 10 new books from 
          Bridge Street Books to offer to the list. Hopefully this will be of 
          use for browsers as well as shoppers, simply as a bit of 'what's new.' 
          The suggestion (in fact it was from Charles Bernstein) has grown over 
          the years, and each monthly email now far exceeds the original number 
          of 5-10. It's also worth adding that aside from announcements by authors 
          and publishers, Bridge Street is the only bookstore on the Buffalo list 
          that does announcements (and does them still). But I mention the emails 
          because although they might appear marginal to Smith's poetry, his quotations 
          or comments on each book afford a glimpse into some of the motivations 
          in his work. Here are some more interesting or oddball posts:<br>
