          <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On November 
          5, an article in <i>The New York Times</i>, titled &quot;Using Rats 
          to Trace Anatomy of Fear, Biology of Emotion,&quot; offered a metaphor 
          (or perhaps an actual scientific explanation) of the manner in which 
          Rod Smith's poetry interacts with consciousness. The <i>Times</i> article 
          states: &quot;New research strongly suggests that emotions are biological 
          functions, channeled through the amygdala, which triggers physiological 
          responses. A direct pathway goes from sense organs to the sensory thalamus 
          and from there to the amygdala. This pathway does not allow for cortical 
          processing and may be responsible for emotional responses a person does 
          not understand.&quot; The aspect of this model of the (albeit rat) brain 
          I find most compelling is the notion of a direct pathway that bypasses 
          the traditional center of &quot;understanding,&quot; that allows for 
          emotion (which could include aspects of the so-called intellect) and 
          response without comprehension. I would add to it, however, the suggestion 
          that the necessary and sufficient conditions of &quot;understanding&quot; 
          should in turn be altered. Rod Smith understood as Bach is. And then 
          some. This is a guess, but Rod Smith's work goads me to suspect a syntax 
          of emotion, of import, a direct route between sound and sense, between 
          the cadence, the symphonic structure, of a poem and the variety of things 
          we call its meaning. This is intuition, but &quot;should anyone ask 
          what intuition is, it's what you think / it is&quot; (&quot;In Memory 
          of My Theories&quot;). Smith often employs this kind of sad (that's 
          all there is) and comforting (you haven't been getting it wrong) truism, 
          tautology even, that shows language in all its self-referential, obvious 
          obscurity. He simultaneously offers a simple definition of the word 
          <i>intuition</i> and fragments that definition amongst the infinite 
          number of possible yous addressed. <br>
          <br>
          Although what I am provisionally calling a &quot;syntax of emotion&quot; 
          could be assembled with a syntax of vision and spatial composition, 
          I conceive of it as a function of sound in time, and my primary understanding 
          and appreciation of Smith's work has come from hearing him read. While 
          the music is there on paper, built-in (and his work is quite carefully 
          and generously laid onto the page), he has the Stradivarius and the 
          cheat sheet&#151;I imagine something akin to Eric Satie's &quot;Performance 
          Indications&quot; (<i>A Mammal's Notebook</i>), with directives such 
          as &quot;be-dig yourself,&quot; &quot;haggard in your body,&quot; and 
          &quot;light, but decent.&quot; If he comes to your town, go.<br>
          <br>
          As regards the Sacks quote and some of what I may have implied above, 
          <i>In Memory of My Theories</i> is by no means incomprehensible nonsense, 
          or even something approaching so-called sound poetry. It matters that 
          it's not in French. (Visually, very fine distinctions are drawn between 
          upper- and lowercase letters, punctuation marks, indents, etc., making 
          as full a use of the notational capacities of English as of the aural, 
          though never with a sense that there is a rigid, pre-determined system 
          in place.) Smith's work is laced with content and highly modulated. 
          But he doesn't just make sense, he <i>makes</i> sense. It is impossible 
          to peel the skin of words off the apple of what Sacks calls &quot;expression.&quot; 
          Perhaps the work describes itself best: &quot;veiled lattice tangle, 
          ask it to weep lint. the ear is the mortal tense, entering the / chest 
          through the inkstand. That aura of miffed significance swirling in the 
          / unshed mask of distillate matter&quot; (&quot;Sieff&quot;).<br>
          <br>
          These poems are both hyper-linguistic (i.e., language pointing to itself, 
          as an object with all the attendant baggage of etymology, linguistics, 
          etc.) and sub-semantic (i.e., symphonic, the direct route described 
          above). For small-scale examples of the former see lines like &quot;a 
          musical event miss taken for a lyric kingdom // the distant air enters 
          // through distant lungs&quot; (&quot;Bad Ashbery But Fun&quot;), &quot;<i>The 
          lightning is an exaggeration of the light</i>&quot; (&quot;<i>(illegible)</i> 
          Lake&quot;), &quot;The tiger of a growth / A hill full-a hole full / 
          is scanty easily scattered&quot; (&quot;XCII (cinder-sifter)&quot;), 
          and &quot;life-size freight / the light of / lightful / lighting / bring 
          to throw or shed &amp; cream or bulb / beak / break / ottava rima the 
          terrible / silent excess of tortured imputation&quot; (&quot;Your goofy 
          fremitus . . .&quot;). The latter, the symphonic accumulation of punch, 
          is harder to show in this context, taking place as it does over the 
          course of entire poems, the course of the book. And, moreover, it is 
          wrong to present these two aspects of the work in opposition or contrast. 
          That apple won't be peeled either. It's all skin. Or all flesh. &quot;(Collective 
          relevant regular migraine People are / failing // I don't feel // more 
          or less red Most // When the moment hits / In the voice / knocked numerous 
          // diffuse ambiguity // snow paper&quot; (&quot;The Inveterate Poem&quot;).<br>
          <br>
          Like Ludwig Wittgenstein's <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, of which 
          I am reminded by Smith's use of red above, <i>In Memory of My Theories</i> 
          is a text that listens very carefully to itself, that hears the linguistic 
          assumptions implicit in it's propositions, and that then goes on to 
          question, subvert, pervert, and toy with them, all the while mindful 
          of their serious and real-world ramifications. Smith throws &quot;language 
          games&quot; and &quot;people are starving&quot; alike into the lottery 
          hopper, and retrieves them, &quot;sutured by or // accomplished. Sedimentary 
          articulation / become the lush agnostic coal of // [. . .] everything 
          in this one // nothing in addition&quot; (&quot;The Latest Attempt&quot;).<br>
          <br>
          Which brings me to a few notes on content and method. <i>In Memory of 
          My Theories</i> is an invective, a question, a treatise, and a prayer. 
          It engages issues of perception, resemblance, artifice, and politics&#151;the 
          political as an intellectual and emotional force&#151;the consequences 
          visible when world and language are attended to. It bears both the tyranny 
          of the American government, and the tyranny of the self aware of it 
          cognitive limits. &quot;The surface, if it's found // is a symbol. Discrepancy's 
          essence // Is curlicue / Is land terrific // perceptual shifts hug the 
          coast &amp; shimmer / amidst what I consider even now // the assassinated 
          evident / <i>getting nowhere</i> / with a ten foot pole&quot; (&quot;In 
          Memory of My Theories&quot;). <br>
          <br>
          Smith takes standard dichotomies (interior/exterior, mind/body, etc.) 
          and reconfigures them, removes the standard value grid to reveal a more 
          wrenching grid of doubt. &quot;[A]nd the body you have / is entirely 
          the body / of vacuous mental images // constant round of becoming / 
          bless me to transmute them // we are by nature heavily there // and 
          there appears&quot; (&quot;In Memory of My Theories&quot;). Everything 
          is false, and yet incessantly weighted. Or weighted by the inability 
          to distinguish. The same details reappear (clocks, dust, habit) as if 
          markers that we are lost and covering the same ground over, though someone 
          has been there in the interim to rearrange things just a little. &quot;[T]hese 
          savored days / these cycles / lapse back into statement // certain non-abstractions 
          melt the equal sign and once / cloned become the dust we use to protect 
          our paintings&quot; (&quot;In Memory of My Theories&quot;). And we are 
          back to the real, to detail, to staring at the impenetrable details 
          of accumulated history with which we obscure the distorted image of 
          ourselves we chose to show posterity.<br>
          <br>
          This de-dichotomizing is also part of how Smith's work is structured 
          and moves&#151;motion, if not arrival, being key. He revels in the habits 
          of syntax, and breaks them. The action lies not in the action of event, 
          of verbs, but in that of connection, a linguistic motion&#151;derived 
          from his use of prepositions&#151;of what belongs to what, what suture, 
          what addition. Even the verbs are sometimes made to work like prepositions. 
          &quot;So It Is that / the direction is indented by the dubious double 
          affect of the undone area she / is to be believed to inhabit&quot; (&quot;Sieff&quot;). 
          The motion is made constant also by musical combination, vowel-sound 
          surface progressions and Anglo-Saxon sound patterns within a Latinate 
          (however interrupted) syntax. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
          The emotional impact of the work is neither representative nor reductive. 
          Though in some contexts notational, it carts a &quot;life-size freight,&quot; 
          takes place on the one-to-one scale at which it is written. Alongside 
          these philosophical, linguistic, and emotional (by which I think I mean 
          a manner of tragic pleasure, &quot;hoarding // surely intense // loss 
          // his mouth // shuts his // stammering // tools&quot; [&quot;For Loss&quot;]) 
          effects, In Memory of My Theories is also frequently funny, sometimes 
          vulgar, and never sentimental or lax. It is not (a venial, if not a 
          cardinal, sin) the re-telling of a pre-processed experience, interpretation 
          included, but an investigation of, the very act of, experience and interpretation, 
          a thought-experiment protocol on itself: &quot;Always to know the pattern 
          // being difficult // things this / is called // to make&quot; (&quot;For 
          Loss&quot;).</font><br>
