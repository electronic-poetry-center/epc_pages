        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One has touched vers, toward what objection hardy knows,<br>
          Touched glass, meddled the poem, cracked crystal show- </p>
        <p>shelves in the thrift stores, smashed debris again, gained in<br>
          intensity, yet blocked comment! Reined in.</p>
        <p>Stand there, restlessness. Also femaleness, heightened by<br>
          another hot flash, time, loss, annoyance, frankly</p>
        <p>can't sit still, flesh floods the place as loose as <br>
          sloggy water, sandy brookings where one tides a bay, </p>
        <p>&quot;surfant le web&quot; or &quot;parling anguish.&quot; Where<br>
          beach-rose berries globen orange ripe, Here,</p>
        <p>is this Happening? alongside what text, in what cued<br>
          brain extt, or xtte? The lemma-afloat with breathing tube</p>
        <p>wiggles through rushing fish wash, blue schools they were <br>
          running light tween, twist unseen from wavers of a placid sea,</p>
        <p>breath deliberate in the mouth and loud, husky heaves<br>
          of own survival. El allows for depth just under the surface</p>
        <p>between subaqueous seam and down-- &quot;that zone&quot; <br>
          &quot;that parallel world we live in whenever we waken to it.&quot;</p>
        <p>So stroke those looping, loping tunes beyond Gelassenheit. <br>
          Loft that haunting melody all sheeny bright,<br>
          <br>
          and reach your fingers in between the modal pings<br>
          to play and twist those other, shadow, strings. </p>
        <p>When you listen to the vibe of disinterested phonemes <br>
          Pheromones of phonemes, indecisive decibel, it </p>
        <p>garners the supplement of illusion. Inclusion. Hallucination. Keys<br>
          on little pegs. All of them indifferent, all tagged with names,</p>
        <p>chained charms and souvenirs, foreign, near, for the car, <br>
          for the ear. Where were they seen, the keys? So far.</p>
        <p>Where heard? Per word. What instrument? Already rent.<br>
          And lock to match and sound to catch? Unknown.</p>
        <p>Real or a dream? Hope or a shuck? Schtick or stuck?<br>
          Stumbled walker, shivering singer-where and to do what? </p>
        <p>How to live? what's to hope? who's to say?<br>
          By the side of the road, trash cravings amid crazy ravings,</p>
        <p>I saw a stranger at a rusted fire of cartons and cartels<br>
          a-singeing songs. &quot;Who are you?&quot; Now what? </p>
        <p>It is simply-simply NO, not and never simply. For as he paces,<br>
          as he rocks, as he feeds the fire, this place, this nothing place </p>
        <p>becomes beyond. A flesh sketch of something else.<br>
          For the return to wandering. As cure and as disease.</p>
        <p>He told me his ears hurt, one who at the end, is X, a blank <br>
          a wanter among nomad wanderers, caught</p>
        <p>like s.l.a.n. on the book, sine loco, anno, nomine,<br>
          holding rank ends of a split, so I said I was dizzy.</p>
        <p>Fine. Now what? Where did I see the keys? This is loco.<br>
          From the fire's wandering chorus, &quot;melancholy&quot;</p>
        <p>was the one word on the page as it sizzled, crumpt up, nought.<br>
          The burn was 15 orange, one orage, zero blue and weightless </p>
        <p>worse--brownish silvering dense explosive points,<br>
          wind aggression roaring, tornado through the straight.</p>
        <p>A person never knows the bravery that times<br>
          demand until they riddle how to construct the correct </p>
        <p>&quot;crimes.&quot; Ques: how to preserve the archives of dada<br>
          (Ans: in metal boxes buried near your hovel).</p>
        <p>Nazis knocked but came without a shovel,<br>
          lucky for her. How to be courageous and stupid.</p>
        <p>Who are you? What do you do it for? for natural light,<br>
          to keep these listeners awake, plus dead and time.</p>
        <p>All local and all destroyed must speak accurately<br>
          how the man stood on the margin of edge</p>
        <p>larbage dreams with dusk, cardbore and ash. <br>
          Why scan, capture, index, interlink this trash?</p>
        <p>&quot;For your good health, Barrel Picking is prohibited.&quot;<br>
          Why not leave well enough alone?</p>
        <p>A play within the play, he hove sprechstimme<br>
          fragments in half an anguage, ghostily selected</p>
        <p>strung together as if continuous text,<br>
          hallucination's vantage keying incantation sentinel,</p>
        <p>with restless regard &quot;not from a place on which to fix<br>
          but from a crossing of that place, a crossing of that crossing.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p>He began to experience difficulties with reality;<br>
          for him each human soul remained a human soul. <br>
          <br>
          But it is hard to act without shame, though<br>
          this be always true, for who it act it in your name?</p>
        <p>The dream of turning the key in the lock as the wind in the door<br>
          moaned and the crow flew with its yard-wide wingspan</p>
        <p>into the pear tree finding the open place. Now what?<br>
          He asked me, Why do you do what you do?</p>
        <p>Do you take this adult set of sores<br>
          as yours for use in the urban scavenger tradition </p>
        <p>to enchain all it with it? to travel through the spot-deep text of 
          song?<br>
          Je est un interstate, he said. &quot;We Welcome Christian Tours.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          There were left-handed shadows facing east<br>
          cloud cover over cloud cover, pumpkins sporting flags,</p>
        <p>ever-whispering space when ick geschri or scry<br>
          every unspeakable untellable yod inside the bye.</p>
        <p>This man with a small tree growing from his neck<br>
          was arrayed in imaginary memories, dot by dot, <br>
          <br>
          &quot;where the fibrous roots of every heart on earth<br>
          infixes deep its restless twists,&quot; arraigned with</p>
        <p>weights across the border where he stood by fire, <br>
          the day dedicated to the evanescent ruffle of silence</p>
        <p>as it teasing, tonging turns to hissy clumps, a spree<br>
          and spray of listed sound, a funny Jew d'esprit.</p>
        <p>So sung, singing with waves the theremin, harp of the heap<br>
          sung with the hands, with the mouth, hand to mouth, a </p>
        <p>paltry of mishegoss and dreck, <br>
          of unsatisfied satisfactions, allowering the wreck</p>
        <p>to float out in brightness and disjuncture, all rift.<br>
          Poultry plants where bloody flesh and fast knives lift,</p>
        <p>it's immigrunts work there why can't they just<br>
          speed Aing lish fast and wishing well like ust. </p>
        <p>The fire got low, the voice asked, Who are you?<br>
          Stood in waves of strangeness, shaken rue, </p>
        <p>still sigh underneath senselessness, to find<br>
          such speech songs scanned, rotated, aligned,</p>
        <p>as addled noise to Nos, news to blues.<br>
          From search string, fuzzy and phonemic search, </p>
        <p>from word stemming, natural language lurch<br>
          fall Drafts and fragments, Drifts and figments,</p>
        <p>scrap paper shreds and fan-shaped books of Pantone <br>
          pigments. Asked a simple question: Why do you do</p>
        <p>what you do? The world is all that's In Your Face.<br>
          Curious stranger still, as stranger place by place.</p>

        <p>Notes to Draft L: Scholia and Restlessness. There was, as in &quot;Draft 
          20: Incipit,&quot; another incident like the &quot;Curious, this querying 
          letter from a stranger&quot;: this one an e-mail by Michael Collino 
          in mid-November 2001. Some of the questions in this poem were asked 
          by him. &quot;J'apporte en effet des nouvelles. Les plus surprenantes. 
          M&ecirc;me cas ne se vit encore. On a touch&eacute; au vers.&quot; St&eacute;phane 
          Mallarm&eacute;, &quot;La Musique et les Lettres,&quot; <i>Oeuvres compl&egrave;tes</i>, 
          1945, 643. At Oxford/ Cambridge in 1894. &quot;I am truly bringing news. 
          Astonishing news. And never seen before-We have been meddling with verse.&quot; 
          Trans. Lawrence Lipking, cited in his article &quot;Poet-critics&quot; 
          in <i>The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism</i>, vol. 7, ed. Litz, 
          Menand, and Rainey. But see also the translation of Rosemary Lloyd that 
          ends: &quot;Poetry has been under attack.&quot; <i>Mallarm&eacute; in 
          Prose</i>, ed. Mary Ann Caws, 32.&quot;That parallel world we live in 
          whenever we waken to it&quot;: Charles Bernstein, e-mail on his book 
          <i>With Strings</i> (2001). Description of the strings between other 
          strings concerns the Welsh triple harp. S.l.a.n.: without place, year, 
          name. The archives of dada: from the life of Hannah H&ouml;ch. &quot;For 
          your good health, Barrel Picking is prohibited&quot; is a sign in a 
          Maine rest stop on I 95, 2001. The citation &quot;not from a place on 
          which to fix/ but from a crossing of that place, a crossing of that 
          crossing,&quot; is, slightly modified, from Michael Moon, <i>Disseminating 
          Whitman: Revision and Corporeality in Leaves of Grass</i>, 109. &quot;Where

          Theremin,&quot; ABACUS #142, 15 November 2001. When I went to Georgia, 
          someone said &quot;poultry plants,&quot; whereupon I heard &quot;poetry
