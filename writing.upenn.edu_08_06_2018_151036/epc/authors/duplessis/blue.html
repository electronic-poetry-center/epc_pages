      <blockquote> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dear Barbara: Thank you for addressing your querying letter to me. 
          In response, I have been writing to you in my head, on trains, walking 
          around, and sitting still, and now want to write everywhere, all through 
          what you ask. You make me want to condense everything I know about gender 
          and poetry and poetics into one heavy leathery medicine ball and to 
          throw it towards you and to your &quot;generation&quot; or &quot;genderation&quot; 
          - Hey CATCH! But if you can write the kind of letter you just did indeed 
          write (and have written over all the years we have known each other), 
          you are, without a doubt, working towards answering your own questions. 
          Catching your own ball. So to speak. That much passionate desire to 
          define, to understand, to formulate will not go unanswered-by yourself. 
          And in the mean time&#133;.this. </p>
        <p>But there is not simply one &quot;ball&quot; of &quot;stuff.&quot; 
          Do you remember Matisse's &quot;Red Studio&quot; (1911)-in MOMA, and 
          once, in my kid years, my favorite painting in the whole wide world. 
          The painting displays some of his own work reproduced in miniature-seven 
          or maybe eight paintings, some sculpture, and empty frames, some ceramics, 
          and some blue chalk and maybe brushes too, waiting to be used, some 
          d&eacute;cor (a trail of vine in a vase) all set inside a passionate 
          deep-but-flat red field-his studio, where the furniture magically recedes 
          into outlines so that the work can float, hang and entice in this blood 
          red space. Little mini-women are depicted (as Adalaide Morris reminded 
          me)- as a statue, on a plate, in a painting-these figures are artifacts 
          of Art as an institition, part of what is made, contained, and set within 
          his magisterial red world. This a kind of Matisse-kit, the way the valises 
          are a Duchamp-kit. But, to speak of red, we have also to account for 
          another red painting, the odd, busier &quot;Red Room&quot; also called 
          &quot;Harmony in Red&quot;(1908) in Leningrad/ St. Petersburg. A female 
          servant, a table, bowls of fruit, wallpaper and tablecloth both aswirl 
          with large blue baroque patterns, and in the window, or in a painting, 
          stage left-a bluegreen field of flowering fruit trees. A bourgeois interior 
          filled with gender ideas of making beauty in family service. Given these 
          red paintings, it might be dangerous for the female figure to claim 
          a Red Studio or a Red Room-looks like I might get absorbed into decor. 
          So in the contrarian manner that got me naming a book <i>The Pink Guitar</i>, 
          extending Wallace Stevens where he wasn't himself going, I think I'll 
          call this Blue Studio. </p>
        <p>Studios are places to work. Working and praxis. Let's do it. I want 
          to make a Blue Studio as a set of arcades of thought in which one might 
          wander. But together they add up to more than just any one &quot;painting&quot; 
          or &quot;arcade&quot; or &quot;position.&quot; Blue mischief, blue as 
          the color for boys, blue for the Blau part of my name, blue as the &quot;color&quot; 
          of open thought. Therefore blue gender trails out to various horizons. 
          These were sometimes called &quot;azure&quot; in favor of an airy space 
          beyond, a symbolist empyrean, but I'll try to stay a realist and just 
          say &quot;blue.&quot; This is because I want skepticism, formulations 
          that don't necessarily stay still, but urge transformative, progressive 
          practices. I believe in your questions and in mine; I believe in the 
          power of our observations. So therefore: Hardly in the spirit of a fixed 
          &quot;answer&quot; but in the spirit of friskiness, pensive loose ends, 
          and rumination--I give you this. A blue studio of arcades, through which 
          to move.</p>
        <p>Arcade 1. &quot;Hurricanes are named to prevent confusion when there 
          is more than one active at a time. Since 1953, Atlantic tropical storms 
          have been named from lists originated by the National Hurricane Center, 
          which are now maintained and updated by an international committee of 
          the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The lists featured only 
          women's names until 1979 when the WMO was persuaded to use male names 
          and to name the storms in an alternating 'girl-boy-girl-boy' pattern.&quot; 
          (Information pamphlet from AMICA insurance)</p>
        <p>Do you find this as amusing as I did? Amusing and riling. That agency-less 
          &quot;was persuaded,&quot; loses those whose efforts did the persuading. 
          The syntax makes turgid, lumbering institutions refigure themselves 
          as originators, from their own benevolence, of a new clarification. 
          Official History: there it is. Well-can we expect to get thanked? Whereas 
          the truth of the matter-surly, intransigent, annoying questions, loud 
          voices, and ironic contempt (&quot;I mean they even name STORMS only 
          after WOMEN&quot;), anger about the deep cellular imbedding of ideology 
          in every detail (&quot;storms after women-so destructive, so femme fatale-ish, 
          like Men are never destructive!&quot;)-the whole raucous assemblage 
          of rage, flair, critique, shoving, pushing, and analysis that was The 
          Women's Movement did change culture. We took initiative; we called it; 
          we &quot;told it like it is&quot;-translation-as we saw it. And &quot;it&quot; 
          was &quot;everything.&quot; The women's movement still has the capacity 
          fundamentally to call social and cultural arrangements into question, 
          But Culture here, in the form of the WMO, opens its wide gullet and 
          swallows the critique whole. What critique? it says, licking its chops. 
          Now think of the university. We had the guts. Some got the glory. But 
          you have to not want glory, but want to do things, to say things, to 
          perceive things because they need rectification. So we have challenged, 
          we have changed the naming storms.</p>
        <p>The naming of storms like ourselves.</p>
        <p>Arcade 2. I remember sitting, lonely and isolated, in approximately 
          1971 or 1972, in Lille, France, where I was teaching. It washed over 
          me (such was the force of One of the Great Books of the early cultural-social 
          feminist movement-Kate Millett's <i>Sexual Politics</i>) that all of 
          culture would have to be reseen with feminist eyes from the very beginning. 
          Everything would have to be remade-the Greeks, the Bible, the histories 
          of literature and poetry, all cultural products, all-name them! I could 
          not even begin to name the number of genres-fairy tales. Children's 
          books. In a mini-second, far beyond drowning in the enormous sea of 
          this, I lifted up as on a gigantic blue-green-grey wave; I might have 
          imagined being on a tremendous surfboard-I don't even have the metaphor. 
          Riding the &quot;second wave&quot;? A long march through the institutions 
          is more like it. Everything! Remade! Ever since, I have been doing what 
          I could. It's not euphoria or fashionableness-those could never motivate 
          30 years of work. It's more like Conviction.</p>
        <p>If &quot;language is possible only because each speaker<br>
          sets himself up as a <br>
          subject <br>
          by referring to himself as I <br>
          in his discourse&quot; (Emil Benveniste, <i>Problems in General Linguistics</i>, 
          225)</p>
        <p>one might be bemused<br>
          by all that &quot;he&quot; &quot;his&quot; and &quot;himself&quot; or<br>
          not<br>
          <i>(it's not emphasized, not in italics)</i> </p>
        <p>Saying &quot;language is possible only because each speaker<br>
          sets herself up as a subject, referring to herself<br>
          as I in her discourse&quot; is not wrong<br>
          but it's not the form that our Generalizations <br>
          generally take,<br>
          hence<br>
          it sounds more particular, less authoritative, less applicable to All.<br>
          Makes a specific observation, not a statement in Theory&#133;.<br>
          What is the &quot;lesson&quot;?<br>
          &quot;When I count, there are only you and I together<br>
          But when I look ahead up the white road<br>
          There is always another one walking beside you&quot; (T. S. Eliot, <i>The 
          Waste Land</i>)</p>
        <p>so there is a third<br>
          travelling ahead of us or beside us (the ambiguity is fascinating)<br>
          -&quot;who is the third who walks always beside you?&quot;<br>
          looks like (is it an Antarctic hallucination? from the deep poles<br>
          of ideology?) looks like <br>
          it's gender </p>
        <p>Arcade 3. Let's say a word about &quot;Woman.&quot; At all moments 
          in feminist theorizing, the term &quot;women&quot; is a twisted but 
          necessary umbrella caught in the crosswinds of strong political and 
          ideological storms. In a storm, you might want that umbrella. Although 
          to some, &quot;woman&quot; might look just like a female person, the 
          term <i>women</i> has had a historically and temporally variable content, 
          and has pointed to a variety of meanings necessary at various times 
          to embrace and deplore, to worm out of, and to process, to affirm and 
          to deny, to feel as central to oneself, and to feel as unimportant. 
          For example, are women (Coca-Cola we might call them) &quot;equal&quot; 
          and parallelly the same as that other gender (Pepsi we might call it), 
          or are they different, which means emphasizing differences of all kinds 
          in relation to production, the praxis of writing, theme, motif, subjectivity, 
          dissemination, and reception. This long-standing dialectical debate 
          between equality/ sameness and difference has created a very rich terrain. 
          Faced with this insoluble debate, some people might find it annoying, 
          rearticulating a position curiously similar (in a different context) 
          to that taken by high-minded, pioneering women of the 1950s--gender 
          does not matter at all. Or, under the rubric of queerness, they might 
          take a pluralizing position-so many gender places to combine and articulate 
          (Jolt we might call this position).</p>
        <p>I always cite Denise Riley at this kind of moment, and I might as well 
          do so again. This comes from the final pages of her important book <i>&quot;Am 
          I That Name&quot;: Feminism and the Category of 'Women' in History</i> 
          (University of Minnesota Press, 1988), 113-114. &quot;So feminism must 
          be agile enough to say, 'Now we will be &quot;women&quot;-but now we 
          will be persons, not these &quot;women.&quot;' &#133;To be, or not to 
          be 'a woman'; to write or not 'as a woman'; to espouse an egalitarianism 
          which sees sexed manifestations as blocks on the road to full democracy; 
          to love theories of difference which don't anticipate their own dissolution: 
          these uncertainties are rehearsed endlessly in the history of feminism, 
          and fought through within feminist-influenced politics. That 'women' 
          is indeterminate and impossible is no cause for lament. It is what makes 
          feminism&#133;.The temporalities of 'women' are like the missing middle 
          term of Aristolelian logic; while it's impossible to thoroughly be a 
          woman, it's also impossible never to be one.&quot;</p>
        <p>Arcade 4. To call for, to notice, to gloss, to comment upon the productive 
          presence of women artists and writers in this era and the eras long 
          past is to be indebted to feminist cultural criticism and related modes 
          of cultural poetics, such as gay, lesbian, queer and ethnic criticisms. 
          To call for, to notice, to gloss, to comment upon the productive and 
          generative presence of gender ideas of all sorts-from the lurid to the 
          utopian-in male and female writers is to be indebted to feminist cultural 
          criticism and related modes of cultural poetics. I could go on. But 
          I would like simply and openly to declare our <i>collective</i> debt 
          to feminism, no matter that some people might reject, balk, wonder, 
          resist, demur, take themselves away or out of that, see it as a trap. 
          Feminism, and related gender-curious investigations have changed the 
          terrain of the possible. </p>
        <p>Feminism. As Virginia Woolf said in <i>A Room of One's Own</i>, certain 
          material differences between men and women are constructed and perpetuated 
          in our societies. It is the task of feminist politics to resist these, 
          to try to dismantle them, and it is the task of feminist inspired gender 
          critique to understand the impact of these material differences on the 
          production, dissemination, reception and continuance of artists and 
          texts. Feminist criticism is a materialist perspective, but it also 
          investigates how this &quot;matter&quot; plays and is perpetuated in 
          forms of the symbolic order-in ideology from poetry to religion, from 
          &quot;women's place&quot; to representations. Thus feminist thinking 
          tries to hold in a single thought both materialist and ideological studies 
          in their interactions. Their mutually supporting and mutually confounding 
          activities. </p>
        <p>Once this is said and acknowledged, I don't particularly care who calls 
          themselves/ herselves/ himselves &quot;a feminist.&quot; </p>
        <p>Women had a lot of different ideologies to help them take voice and 
          vocation as writers (and certainly a passel of ideologies and practices 
          impeding that claim to voice and vocation). Powerful writers might gain 
          power for themselves or possibly cultural power by separating from the 
          &quot;group&quot; Woman and/or from any &quot;label&quot; attachable 
          to that group, from &quot;feminine&quot; to &quot;feminist.&quot; This 
          might be seen (judgmentally) as a form of &quot;denial,&quot; or more 
          neutrally as a circumstantial strategy. Certainly no one has to claim 
          that feminism's rising tide helped their production if they don't feel 
          it did. But I think you are annoyed at the disingenuousness of others. 
          So be it. Signing up, signing on is the issue-what does it mean to be 
          a &quot;feminist poet&quot; or a &quot;woman poet&quot;-and of course 
          these are different, for one is an ideological category and the other 
          might be descriptive or laden with assumptions or both mixed up together.</p>
        <p>One little attitudinal (and therefore methodological) practice that 
          one might learn from the practice of feminist criticism-whether or not 
          one likes, admires, cathects to, or loves any individual woman writer--is 
          the necessity to offer at least as much empathetic understanding to 
          the products of women as to those of men. This is linked to the historical 
          responsibility to examine what women did and are doing, and why: motives, 
          constraints, their own reigning ideologies as they entered the world 
          to speak. (These reigning ideologies need not be attractive; they can 
          involve self-disparaging, resistance to other women, brilliant rage, 
          saccharine charm and so on.) This point comes from my historical experience 
          of the notable erasure, disparaging, and undervaluing of women's cultural 
          products and testaments. This point must not be misunderstood as being 
          uncritical of nor sentimental about women. No more empathetic understanding 
          than one offers the work of men-just approximately the &quot;same&quot; 
          calibration. This statement comes from a feminism of &quot;equality/ 
          sameness,&quot; not one of &quot;difference.&quot; At the same time, 
          because the literary products of women are still a bit rarer than those 
          of men, one might offer a tiny dollop of identification, going beyond 
          the extra mile. This statement comes from a feminism of &quot;difference,&quot; 
          not one of &quot;equality /sameness.&quot; Watch out-I just somewhat 
          contradicted myself. Look at the oscillation, the dialogic shimmer, 
          the wobbling, the wavering, the fluidity, the tacking between semi-contradictory 
          positions! having A and not-A coexist-both/ and thinking (as I said 
          in &quot;For the Etruscans,&quot; written 1979). Or speaking, as Anne 
          Waldman does, immediately in <i>Iovis</i> I, of &quot;both/both,&quot; 
          beyond even &quot;both/and.&quot; There's the blue studio of my feminism. 
        </p>
        <p>Another parallel working space occurs in the negotiation of similarity 
          and difference among women-inside the group called &quot;women.&quot; 
          These differences could be class or race or sexuality, or other social 
          locations for subjectivity. The projects of feminism were transformed 
          in the US by theoretical and pragmatic positions taken almost simultaneously, 
          by lesbian women and by women of color, but by other supportive women 
          also. This position asked forcefully how to perceive, understand and 
          acknowledge differences of position and interests while also acknowledging 
          similarities between and among women. </p>
        <p>Arcade 5. There are at least four spheres in which your letter plays, 
          and I want to separate them because I can only, really, speak to some. 
          First: The largest political-social-economic arena: the difficult time 
          in which we live and from which (as nice white US citizens) we vaguely-and 
          precisely--benefit even when we do not desire to benefit. Second: The 
          university as a workplace and as a site of cultural production and reproduction. 
          As our workplace, set in a certain country at a certain time, it demands 
          from us certain activities and tasks ('grading,&quot; &quot;analysis,&quot; 
          &quot;teaching writing,&quot;), the forbidding of other tasks (can't 
          refuse to grade, for example), and inducing political choices (graduate 
          student unionizing drives, for example). The university is emphatically 
          part of the political-social-economic arena. And, as an institution 
          of cultural dissemination, production, articulation and processes, the 
          university is also part of the cultural sphere. Third: The cultural 
          sphere, meaning the place where art products, writing and culturally 
          valued objects and ideologies get made and used. This cultural sphere 
          has numerous institutions and practices attached to it-whether these 
          are coteries, magazines, poetic careers, reward systems, funding lines. 
          Fourth: A fourth sphere (poetry) is hooked to all, but it most obviously 
          intersects with the second and third-a site of activities and practices 
          making poets who make writings and writings that make poets. The particular 
          realm of poetry is vitally important to us. I know most of my answers 
          are from a more particular realm than your questions, which seem sometimes 
          to spill between these realms. However, the whole stage on which we 
          act is the desire for social justice.</p>
        <p>Arcade 6. I find my explorations for you occur along the line of cultural 
          production, cultural dissemination, and cultural reception. You begin 
          with a comment on production: a woman poet &quot;producing&quot; her 
          own biography, rubrics, archive. This is, we would like to think, &quot;secondary&quot; 
          to poetic production, but sometimes I wonder! It is clearly a very serious 
          enterprise, part of the controlling of reception that many poets negotiate 
          as significant work within their production. Your observation leads 
          immediately into your comment about reception. &quot;Canonized or forgotten&quot; 
          is your somewhat binarist formulation for women; one might add some 
          other possibilities-minoritized, disparaged though remembered, frozen 
          at one part of their career only, remembered for quirks and weirdnesses, 
          remembered for their sexual partners, not for writing. But I take your 
          point. Your sentences capture some of the sense of panic and avidity 
          that characterizes our cultural moment. It is also interesting that 
          your remarks suggest there might be conflict and contradiction between 
          (in this case) production and reception. The person saying &quot;I am 
          not a feminist poet&quot; might nonetheless be struck that her reception 
          seems to be occurring under the rubric of &quot;feminist reception.&quot; 
          Her&#133;. (I assume it's a her! why would a male poet say that? Think 
          carefully about the meaning of that answer.) </p>
        <p>So I'm going to talk about two of these three-production and reception, 
          but, as you already said, they all loop together. One issue is &quot;feminist 
          production&quot;-or more colloquially &quot;I am/ am not a feminist 
          poet.&quot; Choose one, apparently? A second issue is &quot;feminist 
          reception.&quot; </p>
        <p>Arcade 7. Let's begin again. The kinds of cultural questions you are 
          asking emerged for me under the rubric &quot;feminism.&quot; But, aside 
          from alluding to the importance of that formation for culture and politics, 
          and declaring my indebtedness, and aside from suggesting (in a friendly 
          tone) that everyone declare their <i>collective</i> indebtedness (see 
          Arcade 3) to the gender materials that have changed the terrain of the 
          possible, I am agnostic, of two or three minds, whether <i>another</i> 
          individual will accept that term, or even, whether she/he needs to. 
          Such a refusal should, to be most effective, not be simply reactive, 
          &quot;against&quot; something. Reactive, paraphrased something like 
          this: &quot;I reject the term because the powerful and annoying women 
          of the generation before me embraced it, and I need to distinguish myself 
          from them.&quot; Or &quot;The positions taken by feminism are out-dated; 
          we don't need them any more.&quot; Or &quot;We need to get on to other 
          issues.&quot; Debating with feminism, or going beyond it, should be 
          creative, generative, coming from another space of the social and culturally 
          possible. But, in my view, such a position must have a dialectical relationship 
          with feminism-precisely sublating it and transcending it. Indeed, this 
          is not refusal or negation, but dialectical negativity. </p>
        <p>What is feminism? To me it means gender justice in the context of social 
          justice. We do not have either, here in the United States, nor do people 
          have it consistently in the world at large (a vast understatement), 
          although some people, mainly in the first world, might do better than 
          US women in particular legal and social rights (around child care, for 
          example; around mandated gender balance in legislative representation, 
          as in France). One needs gender justice only in the context of social 
          justice so women do not benefit in their freedoms from the exploitation 
          of other people, male and female. Since in some places, far from gender 
          justice, the systems of gender and social repression, and multiple exploitations 
          are intense, &quot;feminism&quot; seems like a good word to want to 
          claim. At least until another comes along that can offer solutions, 
          analyses, precisions, and hopes for gender justice in the context of 
          social justice.</p>
        <p>When a person refuses such a word or does not acknowledge the force 
          of gender and sexuality in her/his political analyses of other issues 
          (globalization, ecological disaster, health care policies, rampant nationalisms 
          and fundamentalisms), it can appear as if the issues concerning gender 
          justice and social justice are unimportant for that person. Now a quick 
          segue to our privileged workplace: In the university, this non-acknowledgement 
          might play into hands you (I don't mean <i>you</i>) don't want to be 
          in, might leave a person holding hands with positions a person doesn't 
          want to be linked with-or used by. Loosely-the neo-cons. Or even the 
          hand-wringing privileged. (I love those &quot;hand&quot; metaphors.) 
          Strategically, if a person refuses the word &quot;feminism&quot; too 
          assiduously or forcefully, the effect will be to isolate the women of 
          the feminist generation, curtailing their effectiveness as mentors, 
          as allies, as companions. Some simple results-people who study cultural 
          products of women will once more be marginalized and minoritized as 
          was formerly the case. Syllabi will not reflect the intellectual force 
          of feminist and gender-laden scholarship-in romanticism we will not 
          study romantic era women writers, for instance. People who do serious 
          research on the recovery of women's texts will go unrespected. It will 
          be automatic to say, as was once commonplace, that their work is not 
          up to &quot;standards,&quot; or shows &quot;low quality,&quot; or concerns 
          &quot;backwaters.&quot; Issues important to women and gays in the workplace 
          will be placed last, below last on the institutional agenda (like partner 
          benefits). The marginalization of a prior feminist generation would 
          be unstrategic for women newly entering the university, not in <i>their 
          </i>best interests. </p>

        <p>Arcade 8. However, also strategically, a person might not want to affiliate 
          with all the positions ever taken under the rubric feminism. Of course! 
          The whole point is disaggregating the blanket term, making it precise 
          and situational. This seems obvious, but worth repeating. &quot;Feminism&quot; 
          is a capacious, historically mobile term filled with its own intellectual 
          and political debates, filled with the tugs and pulls of other social-subject 
          locations (class for example, ethnicity, racial ideologies, religious 
          cultures, national interests) and it (the same concept, &quot;feminism&quot;) 
          has had features that would be plausible and necessary to criticize 
          by other wings of feminist positions. Indeed, any political position 
          would have criticizable aspects. So the question must be to ask what 
          feminism, where, facing what, defined by what, responsive to what, blind 
          to what, hostile to what. That is-the questions must be the usual, normal, 
          always new analytic questions.</p>
        <p>To say feminist-the fear might be that such a word brings in its wake 
          lockstep allegiances and inflexible -- as well as unsubtle analyses. 
          This, too, could be a problem with any political or politicized position. 
          Surely one cannot use feminism as a convenient &quot;whipping girl&quot; 
          for all that! That is, for the rejection of or claim of superiority 
          to &quot;the political.&quot; But one might want the following &quot;rule&quot;: 
          never let theory eviscerate matter. To claim NO or NEUTRAL or UNMARKED 
          or UNIVERSAL &quot;identity,&quot; to claim that superior people don't 
          bother with these mired and specific social locations but rather transcend 
          them (doesn't everybody? my dear!), to assert that <i>you </i>(poor 
          inadequate thing) have prejudices, biases, localisms, but I see the 
          big picture and oh so clearly) are nasty policing devices that blindly 
          favor hegemony and its interests.</p>
        <p>Why should feminism be reduced to its own sentimentalities? Did it 
          not have more to offer even to those who are invested enough in its 
          meanings to attack it?</p>
        <p><i>We said<br>
          feminist</i></p>
        <p>Arcade 9. Here are three examples of uses of feminism in the arena 
          of culture by members of (loosely) your generation. They are all notably 
          serious, committed, inquisitive, and it does not matter whether each 
          or any of them would claim &quot;I am/am not a feminist poet,&quot; 
          for they are all doing work in this &quot;blue studio&quot; of yearning, 
          hope, and gender horizons. They may not be in precisely the same arcade. 
        </p>
        <p>The first is by Rachel Levitsky. It is published as the enabling statement 
          of a chapbook series she has produced from a reading series that she 
          curates (2000, 2001) in New York City: &quot;Belladonna is a reading 
          series at Bluestockings Women's Bookstore that promotes the work of 
          women writers who are adventurous, experimental, politically involved, 
          multi-form, multi-cultural, multi-gendered, impossible to define, delicious 
          to talk about, unpredictable, dangerous with language.&quot; The desire 
          for what I once called &quot;polygynous poetry&quot;(&quot;married&quot; 
          to many women) is one I resound with-all those multi's make this a very 
          attractive statement. But it's more the notion of poetry as engaged 
          with thought and language, with politics and poetics at the same time, 
          that also attracts me to this statement. Because this is in the form 
          of a list, it is not necessary to elaborate the exact relationship of 
          these elements to each other. That's lucky, and it also allows for a 
          generative fluidity of potential linkages. </p>
        <p>The second is by Linda Russo. It occurs in <i>Rust Talks</i> 7 (April 
          2001), a set of materials from Rust Belt Books in Buffalo, and it is 
          in the form of a speculative letter. Hence it is less finished and summarizable. 
          In the passage Russo talks of reading Irigaray and appreciating &quot;her 
          concern for the need to inscribe a feminine genealogy-not as biological 
          imperative, but as a cultural one, a philosophical and political one-because 
          we live in a culture, an era, where the feminine remains largely uninscribed, 
          where women have little influence in how we perceive our world-our myths, 
          images, institutions, our very notion of the subject, the language user.&quot; 
          I am not sure I would only say &quot;the feminine&quot; here-but also 
          &quot;the female&quot;AND females. That culture as we know it has notable 
          ambivalence to the female I agree with absolutely; that this lack and 
          ambivalence are inscribed deeply in ideology, I agree with absolutely. 
          She goes on to say that &quot;Irigaray points out that a feminist genealogy 
          needs to be created to exist alongside the existing one.&quot; I am 
          not certain that Irigaray wants two parallel ideological tracks, except 
          as a provisional cultural step. In any event a &quot;feminist genealogy&quot; 
          seems, at first, to be a useful project for Russo. But then later, Russo 
          talks of writing poetry &quot;in search of a mother,&quot; adding &quot;I 
          don't think I meant, to move over into metaphor, that I was in search 
          of a genealogy of mother-writers-a not uncommon feminist project. I 
          don't consider my self a feminist, and I'm wary of my making of that 
          project.&quot; Here many of the concerns of feminist thinking-including 
          the critique of gender ideology, including the desire for a new subject 
          position, and including Irigaray's challenge to make a new symbolic 
          order, a genuinely bi-gendered symbolic order -are hinted at, but only 
          a specific &quot;parental/maternal&quot; project is called by the name 
          of feminism-and resisted. While I think this is a limiting statement 
          of the many aspects of feminist projects, I do know what she means. 
          The &quot;recovery&quot; of women writers was imbued with a variety 
          of psychic needs. It would be interesting to examine these needs, to 
          articulate the fascinating twist between the object of study and the 
          apparent subject/ critic, to study these with an empathetic and analytical 
          reach. Women critics are, however, not the only ones to identify with 
          the writers they study-anyone ever look at most Pound criticism before 
          about 1980 with an eye to that issue? A lot of different things are 
          implicated for Russo here (including the sorting out of female/ feminine/ 
          feminist), but it is also clear that what is at stake exists in the 
          cultural sphere of gender materials. Whether or not Russo calls all 
          this, or herself, &quot;feminist&quot; does not faze me one way or the 
          other, because I read it emphatically as a gender arcade, or two.</p>
        <p>A third statement from your generation occurs in <i>Tripwire</i> 3 
          (Summer 1999)--the issue is, in fact, devoted to gender. The statement 
          at the head of the issue, written by the editors Yedda Morrison and 
          David Buuck, reads: &quot;The following pages contain a selection of 
          writers and artists actively grappling with the complexities of gender 
          as it pertains to daily life and social practice. Various tendencies 
          seem to color these works: the continued influence of feminist theoreticians 
          on current aesthetic, formal, and political practice; a recognition 
          and inclusion of daily (domestic) life in both content and form; the 
          desire for a simultaneous celebration and eradication of the traditions 
          of one's gender; a deconstruction of male-female binarisms, towards 
          a critique of gender itself as a rigid and socially dictated location 
          which limits and delineates its citizens; and the recognition that any 
          move beyond the confines of gender-based identity and sex-based roles 
          cannot manifest itself by mere proclamation or aesthetic liberty, but 
          must navigate the deeply embedded material and historical relations 
          of patriarchy.&quot; This admirable statement shows the conscious interplay 
          between ideological and material understanding, between the end of gender 
          and its continuing presence; between existing feminist thought and assessment 
          of that thought in practice; between queer thinking and gender inscriptions. 
          It is a notably dialectic statement.</p>
        <p>When I read these manifestations of gender-inflected thinking, I am 
          not depressed (not blue that way), for it appears as if the struggle 
          for a new subjectivity in which gender debates play a central role is 
          well on its way. The major reconsideration of gender arrangements, and 
          their implications for thought, daily life, and art seem notably, even 
          thrillingly alert in these Gender Arcades.</p>
        <p>Arcade 10. However, a person saying &quot;I am not a feminist poet&quot; 
          might be taking another ideological position-that of individualistic 
          performance, beyond &quot;group.&quot; One sees the temptation-to be 
          taken as an individual. &quot;I'm not a feminist poet; I'm just a poet.&quot; 
          Or even better--&quot;I'm not a woman poet; I'm just a poet.&quot; Good 
          luck, sez I. </p>
        <p>These remarks, however apparently negating, are working in the cultural 
          terrain opened by gender-inflected thought-that is, by feminism. Here 
          one must become appreciative of cultural ironies. Poets who thought 
          that they were just poets, not women (for example, Louise Bogan), have 
          now benefited from the existence of a feminist criticism born out of 
          the women's movement; have had their work valorized as part of the group 
          &quot;women&quot; even if they just wanted, in some cases desperately 
          and damagingly, to be poets, just ungendered poets. Other poets, who 
          declared fast that they were feminists, in this gruesome apolitical 
          time, have their solid, principled positions, their solid poetry found 
          an annoyance, inadequate (for example, Adrienne Rich-this remark is 
          dated very precisely in May 2001; by 2010, it will look bizarre, inexplicable). 
          At this point, Black Nationalism looks teachable and &quot;quaint&quot; 
          (please forgive me, if you don't understand I am dripping with irony), 
          but feminism looks again like all those serious girls in ugly clothes 
          who neither know how to put enough makeup on, nor know how to put on 
          enough charm. To play in the cultural field, one always needs a strong 
          sense of irony.</p>
        <p>How about a female person saying &quot;I am a human being, not a 'woman'&quot;? 
          There have been a number of feminist critiques of Woman as a concept, 
          feeling it so riddled with bad ideology as to render it useless, suggesting 
          that we need another name for that female person-once upon a time Monique 
          Wittig polemically offered &quot;lesbian.&quot; There have also been 
          a number of reactions going in the other direction-the implicit-I am 
          a woman not just a human being/ man-because women are better, sweeter, 
          nicer, kinder, more fluid, less linear (a kind of &quot;boy scout&quot; 
          position, so to speak. here there is a gap between ideology and practice). 
          But for the &quot;human being, not woman&quot; statement-- the rejection 
          of &quot;Woman&quot; is a time-honored position within feminism, not 
          outside it. This is because the person's saying &quot;I am a person, 
          not a woman&quot; has seen, even dimly, some disability and hampering 
          attached to the social meanings of &quot;Woman&quot;-and would love 
          to declare herself exempt. Who wants to be a woman, who thinks she is 
          a woman, a woman only, a woman all the time, a woman in every fiber? 
          (Read that Denise Riley passage again.) If I am going to hallucinate 
          &quot;gender&quot; in my cold trek through culture, let me at least 
          have freedom of visualization. Who is that third, fourth, fifth and 
          sixth who walks there beside you? Who doesn't now want female masculinity, 
          males' girlishness, feminine and effeminate texts and acts by males 
          as well as females, androgyny (hey there-lookin' GOOD, again); poets 
          embodying &quot;malehood&quot; (Olson's terms) or &quot;spermhood&quot; 
          (my phrase on Pound), butch straight girls, male lesbians, matri-sexual 
          persons; who doesn't want an array of subjectivities in their studios, 
          engaging in what they imagine is &quot;<i>self</i>-fashioning&quot;? 
          How, under these plural conditions of subjectivity, could we not want 
          &quot;women-as-just-persons&quot; among them? </p>
        <p>This is (I think!) what Alice Notley says in 1980 in her wonderful 
          essay <i>Dr. Williams' Heiresses</i> (Tuumba, 1980). Notice how many 
          contradictory, or unfinished positions on this subject she squeezes 
          into her apparently innocent prose: &quot;I'm not all that interested 
          in being a woman, it's just a practical problem that you deal with when 
          you write poems. You do have to deal with the problem of who you are 
          so that you can be a person talking.&quot; [np, circa &quot;p. 12&quot;] 
          Is she or isn't she holding for issues affecting women here? for woman-poet? 
          for just-poet, no gender? The first sentence-it's a practical problem, 
          one expected to finish with the statement-when you go out on the street 
          and get harassed, or when you want more money on the job. What does 
          it mean not being interested in being a woman if you are one-the way 
          you used to have to dress? or some issues of ideological expectations, 
          perhaps, whether internal or external? What is the <i>practical</i> 
          problem of being a woman when you write poems? Isn't the practical act 
          of writing gender-neutral? Or do we want to talk about interruption, 
          domestic life and so forth. In what sense is being a woman &quot;who 
          you are&quot;? This seems an interesting acknowledging of the force 
          of woman-poet issues, even as they are somewhat shrugged away as an 
          annoyance.</p>
        <p>But maybe Denise Riley's wily temporalities operate here too-that is, 
          sometimes a verse-writing female-person inhabits the position &quot;woman 
          poet&quot; and sometimes not. In an interview with Ed Foster (<i>Talisman</i> 
          13 [Fall 1994/Winter 1995], 76), Anne Waldman precisely illustrates 
          this-the strategic shifts around gender position, for within the space 
          of a half page, she says the following things-not contradictory, exactly, 
          but taking up different emphases and different temporalities within 
          the &quot;feminist poet&quot;/ &quot;woman poet&quot; /&quot;not&quot; 
          set of variables. 1) &quot;the information I'm providing in this roundtable 
          discussion is not bound by gender&quot; One would imagine it is not. 
          But there are issues in reception based on gender; sometimes when women 
          speak they have less authority. Or sometimes, people take their words 
          as being authoritative only when they speak on &quot;gendered&quot; 
          (minor) things-ok to talk on the snack for kindergarten, not ok to talk 
          about nuclear disarmament. In this caveat, Waldman acknowledges the 
          force of assumptions about gender power. 2) (about Jena Osman/ Juliana 
          Spahr's journal <i>Chain</i>): &quot;Well, this is a group of very strong 
          women who feel that there are stories that need to be told and possibly 
          wouldn't get told unless there was a specific forum foregrounding women 
          and their experience.&quot; That is exactly and precisely the kind of 
          thing another person would have said about twenty years earlier about 
          <i>Chrysalis</i> or <i>Calyx</i> or <i>Heresies</i>. 3) Yet she goes 
          on to say, also about Chain: &quot;If it were just a magazine of women 
          writing about being women, it would be like other soapbox feminist magazines 
          and, by definition, limited.&quot; This notably unappreciative remark 
          is a rejection of feminist issues spoken in poetry while paradoxically 
          using the &quot;untold stories&quot; argument that was perfected by 
          those interested in feminist cultural critique. Soapbox is a curious 
          word for Waldman to have used, since she accepts and champions an energetic 
          politicized chant-rant poetry; indeed, she herself has produced enormous 
          jeremiads and-not so much on gender-&quot;soapbox&quot; declamatory 
          poems. So is it simply that declamation on any topic except gender is 
          acceptable, but gender is not? This is an issue to reconsider. 4) &quot;I 
          think you naturally write out of your gender at times. It's one of the 
          energy sources.&quot; Naturally, indeed. What does &quot;natural&quot; 
          mean in this problematized setting? And later in the same piece (p. 
          78), her closing remark 5) &quot;I think bisexuality is the actual mental 
          condition.&quot;</p>
        <p>Arcade 11. Oh, to be judged and appreciated as a person, not a woman, 
          with all the assumptions that might entail. Wouldn't that be lovely? 
          Maybe. Since men and women have different social and cultural positions, 
          whose standard will we be using when we discuss the female of the species 
          as persons? What is &quot;universal&quot; in this instance? Whose criteria? 
          Who controls them? (This is a statement from &quot;difference&quot; 
          feminism.) To want simple equality! to want simply to be judged as a 
          person! Wasn't that all Mary Wollstonecraft asked for, too? To yearn 
          for the unmarked category. </p>
        <p>A better response, in my view, is to mark the male-the formerly unmarked 
          category-and make analytic sport of gendering in the cultural arena 
          for both genders. This position mandates the end of any unmarked, universalizing 
          category with its unspoken powers. </p>
        <p>&quot;In proposing gender as a basic problem and an essential category 
          in cultural and historical analysis, feminists have recast the issue 
          of women's relative identity as equally an issue for men, who, upon 
          ceasing to be mankind, become, precisely, men. Thus gender has emerged 
          as a problem that is always implicit in any work.&quot; Myra Jehlen, 
          &quot;Gender.&quot; In <i>Critical Terms for Literary Study</i>, ed. 
          Frank Lentricchia and Thomas McLaughlin. University of Chicago Press, 
          1990, 265. <br>
          <br>
          You ask, at the end of your piece, &quot;what now?&quot; and one answer 
          is more gender studies more more more, including (what has already begun) 
          gender studies of male figures, masculinity, male privilege, the varieties 
          of male formation. Historicizing forms of manhood, ideologies of masculinity. 
          No longer can &quot;men&quot; function as the unchanging flat backboard 
          against which feminist balls get lobbed. This work is &quot;feminist&quot; 
          in its sources and implications; it is politically and intellectually 
          crucial work. I can think of Gail Bederman, Peter Middleton, Michael 
          Davidson (&quot;Compulsory Homosociality: Charles Olson, Jack Spicer, 
          and the Gender of Poetics,&quot; in <i>Cruising the Performative</i>, 
          eds. Case, Brett, Foster, 1995), Kaja Silverman's work, some part of 
          my new book (<i>Genders, Races, and Religious Cultures</i>); Libbie 
          Rifkin's study of gender and the poetic career (<i>Career Moves</i>), 
          unpublished work by Andrew Mossin and Eric Keenaghan. I can think of 
          dialectics of gender-male and female together (as in Barrett Watten's 
          essay on Hettie Jones in <i>Poetics Journal</i> 10). I can think of 
          the notable article by David Buuck in <i>Tripwire </i>3, that uses both 
          male and female critics and poets to explore: &quot;how masculinist 
          privilege remains a deeply embedded problematic for any attempt to further 
          a political and aesthetic praxis that-ideally-would work against (and 
          not simultaneously benefit from) any such privilege.&quot; [<i>Tripwire</i> 
          3 (Summer 1999], 30.)&quot;Malehood&quot; is a new frontier-of feminist 
          thinking. Doing all the things one did with women, with men, too.</p>
        <p>This is complicated work, for the dangers of apologetics are manifold. 
          Also, the dangers of taking attention away from women and the art work 
          of women-this is probably the deepest danger and would need to be explicitly 
          addressed and individually solved by anyone doing this work. To say 
          the least, such work must self-consciously position itself as deeply 
          rooted in feminist, gay/queer, and gender-inflected thought. So there 
          is no doubt that we need as assiduous and politically-acute, deconstructive, 
          skeptical and suspicious analysis of &quot;male positions&quot; as of 
          female. </p>
        <p>Arcade 12. Of course feminism began, and usually begins again, precisely 
          with personhood in mind-the refusal of the ideological burdens of being 
          lumped with all those droopy &quot;women,&quot; the sense of specialness, 
          the horror-and shame, too, of being so mired. Look at the ambivalences 
          of Simone de Beauvoir. (Just as feminism usually begins to be a little 
          suspect when women are recommodified-c'mon, girls, you can wear nail 
          polish and do swimsuit issues and be cute, and be powerful too! Why 
          this is-our &quot;flapper&quot; moment after our &quot;suffrage&quot;victory--I 
          am not totally certain, but commodification might be key. Leading to 
          questions of where power really lies, what and who are hegemonic.)<br>
          <br>
          But quickly, this painful feminism of dis-identification turns to find 
          what gets analytically dumped on women-and proceeds to get angry in 
          the name of all women (perhaps that was over-identification). To turn 
          to female writers, for example: there are plenty of women writers whose 
          gender basically controlled all the things critics said about them. 
          All this has been well documented in an early article by Elaine Showalter 
          (in the Vivian Gornick and Barbara Moran anthology <i>Woman in Sexist 
          Society: Studies in Power and Powerlessness</i>, 1971) tracking the 
          reviews of nineteenth century women writers, and it was complemented 
          by an earlier, but parallel witty polemic by Mary Ellmann (<i>Thinking 
          about Women</i>, 1968) on the critical flyting of twentieth century 
          women writers. I can think of an incisive chapter by Svetlana Boym (in 
          <i>Death in Quotation Marks: Cultural Myths of the Modern Poet</i>, 
          1991) about the poetess-the contradictory mix of excess and lack bespoken 
          by critics constructing any woman poet as a poetess, and the woman poet's 
          sometimes acceding: her fate is that subjectivity. (What does &quot;<i>self</i>-fashioning&quot; 
          mean under the regimes of gender?) </p>
        <p>So I guess, historically, I see moments of painful, self-conscious 
          dis-identification (&quot;I am not a woman like those other women&quot;) 
          (&quot;I am not a feminist, but&#133;&quot;) as the seed-bed for new 
          efflorescence of gender-progressive thought.</p>
        <p>This individualist personhood is what Dora Marsden was doing in 1913 
          with the <i>Egoist</i>-meaning not narcissist but individualist. And 
          no longer a &quot;free woman&quot; but a &quot;free person&quot;-precisely 
          the &quot;I am not a woman but a person; I am not a feminist writer 
          but a writer&quot; that we have been discussing. My words (ventriloquizing 
          Marsden's position, not my own) were &quot;feminism, o that old thing.&quot; 
          Then you later cited (my paraphrase of) Marsden's curious corollary: 
          &quot;Now women can forge ahead. The burden of proof is one you. So 
          write, women, write!&quot; (<i>Pink Guitar</i>, 45) This kind of statement 
          reveals that there is still a mark or stain of gender-women have something 
          &quot;to prove.&quot; BTW, I didn't say that last thing in my voice 
          either-it's not the kind of cheer that I would enact (in my little cheerleader's 
          uniform) nor dispense as advice. I was being ironic about (as you say) 
          &quot;what such an invitation commands&quot;-but it is the position 
          of the <i>Egoist</i>, that important modernist journal -that there are 
          no groups, only individuals. Historically, one would have to see this 
          as originating in an internecine struggle inside feminism, between social 
          purity and sex radical positions, a struggle which, as the journal's 
          Egoist incarnation took shape, rapidly became an objectively a-feminist 
          position, disinterested in affiliation with any group. (If this interests 
          you, take a look at the &quot;Seismic Orgasm'&quot; chapter in <i>Genders, 
          Races, and Religious Cultures</i>, 2001, at Janet Lyon's superior book 
          <i>Manifestoes: Provocations of the Modern</i>, 1999, and at Bruce Clarke's 
          incisive <i>Dora Marsden and Early Modernism</i>, 1996.) <br>
          <br>
          In the cultural sphere, to say, right now, &quot;I am not a feminist 
          poet&quot; can mean (and imply) a lot of things. Some of those things 
          are contradictory, and some of those things are shorthand for debates 
          and historically attested events that are being alluded to or summed 
          up. In simple, it is part of an attack on hegemonic mainstream poetic 
          practices, thematic rectitudes, and stylistic markers without necessarily 
          seeing why people engaged with them. On the other hand a lot of wonderful 
          work in poetry has been done by people who might well accede to feminism 
          as a political and social demand for gender justice, but who might <i>not</i> 
          particularly engage with the &quot;women's poetry movement,&quot; as 
          Alicia Ostriker names it in <i>Stealing the Language</i>, 1986. One 
          might rather like equal pay for equal work (certainly one would not 
          reject that demand, nor affordable decent child care, nor research on 
          health issues affecting women mainly, like breast cancer), and not like 
          every single poem in <i>Rising Tides</i> or <i>No More Masks!</i>, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>I actually prefer agnosticism about the feminism of production. I don't 
          think women writers need be feminist; I <i>certainly</i> don't think 
          they all need conform to my idea of feminism.(Lucky that-since they 
          don't and won't!) It's enough that they found their way to writing and 
          that I have the benefit of their careers and can watch, appreciate, 
          respond to their struggles, struggles conscious or occluded, with gender 
          and with other positions. I want them to write, women, write (!) in 
          an exploratory, serious and roused way.</p>
        <p>Arcade 13. Feminist poet. It is always valuable to try to slow down 
          somewhat and to articulate what the content of that phrase is. Saying 
          this implies that there is a well-understood entity denominated &quot;feminist 
          poet,&quot; but like any such entity (&quot;objectivist poet&quot;; 
          &quot;New York School poet&quot;), it is only as good as the family 
          resemblances extrapolated from a field of examples that you yourself 
          have assembled (or that someone else has assembled, but you are agreeing 
          with).<br>
          Here's a little incomplete list of possibilities, some quite contradictory: 
          <br>
          Feminist poet=one who talks a lot about gender and sexuality in her/his 
          work. No, wait-that would be lots of poets--Olson, Williams. So try-a 
          poet who marks the constructedness of gender and sexuality in her/his 
          work, takes gender as an ideology about male- and femaleness and wants 
          to investigate, to critique, not simply to benefit.<br>
          Feminist poet=woman poet <br>
          Feminist poet=woman poet consumed (studied, read, appreciated) under 
          the regime of or in the economy of feminist perspectives, whether or 
          not she is a feminist. One might want a different term for this-see 
          the note on &quot;feminist reception&quot; below. <br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who has certain themes in her work, themes 
          (tautologically?) agreed upon as feminist. These themes-Alicia Ostriker 
          names a number: self-division, anger, investigation of myth, assertion 
          of the female body-are very palpable, valuable ways of organizing poetic 
          texts, but have the flaws of their formulizable virtues: of being reductive 
          or making the poem one-dimensional. <br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who writes poems about the liberation of 
          women <br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who resists stereotypes of women-in her life? 
          in her work? both? <br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who resists stereotypes of women and men-again-where?<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who comments on gender issues in her critical 
          work, who thinks about gender in the cultural field<br>
          Feminist poet=woman poet whose work is selectively seen, certain materials 
          heavily valorized because of the existence of feminist criticism and 
          its paradigms. <br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who takes certain themes of &quot;difference&quot; 
          involving women's experiences -menarche, menstruation, childbirth, kid 
          life, sexisms experienced, rape, incest--as central subject matter (some 
          of these topics are not exclusive to women)<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who tells the truth about her life as a woman. 
          And with that verbal emphasis on truth and the unmediated communication 
          of experience, one also might want to investigate the word &quot;tells&quot; 
          or representation. As Margaret Homans so presciently said about Rukeyser's 
          rousing manifesto &quot;No more masks!&quot;: &quot;Lines like Rukeyser's 
          and the expressions of faith derived from them are always exhortatory, 
          never descriptive, because to speak without a mask is an impossibility, 
          for men and for women&#133;.&quot; (<i>Women Writers and Poetic Identity</i>, 
          1980, 40)<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who used to be called a poetess<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet in a certain anthology (like <i>No More Masks!</i>)<br>
          Feminist poet= poet who destabilizes the normative terms of gender/sexuality 
          and makes some kind of critique of those issues in her/his poems. This 
          is closing in on the word &quot;queer&quot; as synonym for &quot;feminist&quot;<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who refuses (self-censors) certain themes 
          or solutions, certain images or insights because they do not explore 
          or lead, in her view, to the liberation of women<br>
          Feminist poet= [woman] poet who calls explicit attention to the relative 
          powerlessness of women and the relative power of men-or who exaggerates 
          this positionality into female powerlessness, male power in all cases.<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet historically coming to her production in 
          some relation to the liberation of women, and to the cultural critique 
          of female exclusions made by feminism in general<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet writing something &quot;politically involved&#133;multi-gendered, 
          &#133;delicious to talk about, unpredictable&quot; (to cite the Belladonna 
          formulation from Rachel Levitsky)<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet affronting the complexities of sexuality, 
          eroticism, desire, odi et amo, frank and startling, decorum breaking 
          (like Dodie Bellamy or Leslie Scalapino)<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who investigates language, narrative, genre 
          and representation in its ways of constructing gender and gender roles. 
          This is Kathleen Fraser's argument: &quot;I recognized a structural 
          order of fragmentation and resistance&quot; that was anti-patriarchal; 
          her argument for the crucial intervention of formally innovative and 
          investigative poetry into a feminist field in <i>Translating the Unspeakable: 
          Poetry and the Innovative Necessity</i>, 2000)<br>
          Feminist poet=a person who is a feminist, and who also writes poetry 
          <br>
          Feminist poet= angry woman, writing poetry<br>
          Feminist poet= ironic woman, writing poetry<br>
          Feminist poet=[woman] poet who is &quot;disobedient&quot; (Alice Notley's 
          term for herself); transgressive (like Carla Harryman); &quot;resistant&quot; 
          (my term about myself); imbuing knowing with its investigative situatedness 
          (like Lyn Hejinian's &quot;La Faustienne&quot;) in full knowledge of 
          gender normativities <br>
          Feminist poet=a poet radically skeptical about gender ideas and arrangements 
          in a culture<br>
          Feminist poet=a poet who knows what she thinks about gender ideas and 
          arrangements in a culture and does not particularly change her mind<br>
          Feminist poet= a poet who sometimes shows herself to be ironic and skeptical 
          about gender and sexual arrangements, but other times is not, or not 
          overtly<br>
          Feminist poet=a woman protesting the place of woman in culture and society 
          (in her poetry? not in her poetry? I didn't say)<br>
          Feminist poet=one who finds herself &quot;mounting an enormous struggle&quot; 
          within culture, including poetry, because of its deeply constitutive 
          gender ideas</p>
        <p>From that contradictory, jubilant and annoying list, there's sure a 
          lot to choose (and you might want to suggest still more options). Feminism 
          in poetry is absolutely not one position. Indeed, one might say that 
          feminism will circulate among, or manifest itself as a number of somewhat 
          alternative positions. Further-remember-these might be inflected with: 
          Difference (women are really different from men; have their own life-themes) 
          (Some women are really different from each other). Androgyny/ mental 
          bisexuality (best person is fused genders in some way). Rights/ sameness 
          (equality of access, of laws, of treatment, generally). Transcendence 
          (have gender but transcend it-it does not play in the realm where writing 
          is made). Queering (breaking the binarist gender norm; eroding the social 
          and aesthetic forms that depend on binarist hierarchies) Just speaking 
          personally, I've probably been in or around all five positions. </p>
        <p>And there will always be a woman poet who may right now be wishing 
          there were <i>no such thing as gender</i>. (Could there be a male poet 
          so passionate on this topic? Think of how their investments differ.)</p>
        <p>Seems unrealistic, but who can blame her. One might see the position 
          as a Blue Studio-as utopian, not as dismissive. </p>
        <p>Arcade 14. A lot of the above list is implicitly about production. 
          That is-to define feminism in poetry, many people have settled upon 
          a feminism of production: having the poem &quot;come forth&quot; as 
          a &quot;statement&quot; that shows certain &quot;ideas&quot; or &quot;themes&quot; 
          and their &quot;rightness.&quot; What indeed is the &quot;role&quot; 
          of ideas or the delivery of knowledge in poetry? So we are here; this 
          much debated issue, another one that isn't going to get solved. It is 
          impossible to hold that ideas and knowledge do not occur in poetry explicitly: 
          Dante? Milton? Blake? Ginsberg? Lucretius? or implicitly: Niedecker? 
          Wordsworth? Or both: Yeats? Oppen? I'd even have tried to say ideas 
          are best if the reader only surmises them-that is, if the writer has 
          carefully hidden them-but that cuts out Dante and Milton. Whoops. A 
          nice correct thing to say here is that it's all about subtle thought, 
          faceted thought. That tends to leave out Pound in certain moods, Eliot 
          in other moods, Swift, etc. So it's not only about subtle thought-poetry 
          can sometimes be about very crude thought. Well, there's always persona 
          theory to work through-who is really &quot;speaking&quot; these ideas 
          and did s/he really &quot;mean&quot; it? </p>
        <p>Ideas in poetry and nothing else gives you a poem that is &quot;an 
          example of&quot; something-of a certain position. This is not terrible, 
          but it doesn't necessarily give more than a sermonizing rhetoric, something 
          to swing to. I've always preferred essay to sermon (sez I smugly-well, 
          you know that I do.).We want the evocative! the porous! the subtle! 
          the imbeddings in language! but I am having a hell of a time defining 
          it. I think it is about conviction that happens inside language within 
          the deepest sensations of language and structure. I think, personally, 
          that poetry should not be bits of tidy patness, embodying thoughts good 
          for me, in poetry. In part this is a manipulative and &quot;rhetorical&quot; 
          use of poetry-someone has in her mind to convince me of something, out 
          of her (or his) benevolence. Let there be one genre that does not Sell 
          Me Something, that does not Condescend to me, that does not Teach me-please! 
          That is, a poetry of meditation, of thinking as praxis, that compels 
          the language to offer up all its resources of play. Let there be one 
          genre that thinks its thinking, and is not a pill or message I am being 
          forced to take! A lot of poetry that uses ideas is really like a fancy 
          glossy advertisement in an upscale catalog. Pottery Barn Poetry. That's 
          what I am arguing against. Didacticism dressed up in attractive language. 
        </p>
        <p>&quot;We write to find what we believe and what we do not believe: 
          there are things we believe or want to believe or think we believe that 
          will not substantiate themselves in the concrete materials of the poem,&quot; 
          said George Oppen (<i>Sagetrieb</i> 3, 3 [Winter 1984], 26).</p>
        <p>Message-bearing poetry where the message has been fixed beforehand, 
          not tested in the acts of language, will make me, as a reader, fly away 
          in the other direction and hide in the eaves. One might then subscribe 
          to the loosely projectivist idea of discovering content/as form and 
          form/as content in the act of writing, or in the practice of writing. 
          This is my position. But I can't be na&iuml;ve as all that. I know damned 
          well that poetry is full of ideas and positions that preceded the writing 
          of any particular poem. Olson wants to convince me of Jung, and so does 
          Rich at a certain point. Baraka wants me to face racism and my race 
          privilege. Hopkins wants to show me the power of his Christian witness 
          and struggles. H.D. wants me to see the mother matrix under Graeco-Roman-Christian 
          culture, whose occlusion has created our cultural and psychic problems 
          even unto war. These people have ideas, and they don't put the ideas 
          aside when they write. So what am I talking about? Is it that the ideas 
          are enacted or performed in language, as if discovered anew in language 
          and structure, inside all the means and mechanisms of poetry? Yes, something 
          like this. As if the language discovers that these ideas are &quot;right&quot;-right 
          for this poem, right here, right now. The poet forgets and then remembers. 
          The reader may remain agnostic, or entranced. </p>
        <p>Is it the old &quot;they shouldn't have &quot;designs&quot; on me? 
          Sort of, but sort of not. I seem to have just said this-am I taking 
          it back now? But how is that possible-don't the writers embody their 
          conviction? What's wrong with, say, Susan Griffin having a few designs 
          on me (in <i>Women and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her</i>), making me 
          think certain gender ideas or reminding me to be uplifted or critical? 
          What is wrong with Alice Notley's <i>The Descent of Alette</i> having 
          plenty of smart designs on the reader about tyranny, about the internalization 
          of ideology, about the collapse of society, about some male privilege, 
          some male pain and female quest? The poem even, drastically, accepts 
          the necessity of well-managed spiritually engaged assassination to &quot;kill&quot; 
          the tyrant inside and outside and thus to liberate those trapped on 
          the subway. If this isn't a feminist poem of ideas-what is?</p>
        <p>I think that the poem I want is the poet's real struggle on the page 
          inside language, inside poetic traditions, inside ideas, inside her 
          time and place, and not the packaging of &quot;fake struggle&quot; set 
          forth either to edify and patronize the reader or narcissistically to 
          embellish the poet. <br>
          <br>
          After all, a test case of &quot;ideas&quot; in poetry is Christianity 
          in Poetry. I mean Herbert, Donne, Milton, Hopkins, the later Eliot-the 
          whole panoply of practitioners whose poetry is absolutely in an idea 
          frame, a whole mythology and set of allusions, a closural, telelological 
          loft (&quot;My God! My King!&quot; kind of ending). I can't not deal 
          with it-it is one central formula of the History of Anglo-American Poetry. 
          Indeed, I see it as an effective mythopoetic tradition, like Greek myths, 
          but telling a different story. What's then wrong with contemporary feminist 
          mythologies and thematizing? Just that it has no churches? (Believe 
          me-I am not calling for this!) Just that it is not as hegemonic as Christianity? 
          Perhaps criticizing awkwardly correct feminist poetry is making women 
          pay the price for the non-hegemony of their gender insights. Or maybe 
          it's just picking out bad examples of period style and saying &quot;oh 
          pooh on that&quot; while ignoring dim examples of period style that 
          are less radical in opinion. Or maybe it's criticizing feminism for 
          acting as if it is Christianity-or any teleological religion, always 
          potentially sanctimonious, and filled with the Right Knowledge of Correct 
          Paths to Salvation. </p>
        <p>But all of this is why I do NOT want a &quot;feminism of production&quot; 
          to be taken as the central cultural act performed by feminists and their 
          intellectual kin. I am enough of a liberal and civil libertarian to 
          resist obdurately anyone telling me (or strongly implying to me) how 
          to write in the correct period-style, what to write, and what formal 
          or linguistic solutions to come up with, what themes are acceptable, 
          and what moves to make with an eye to making rules and boundaries for 
          expression. And I am not fond of anyone's implying that radical poetics 
          are the only route to salvation, either. Any fixed concept of Salvation 
          serving as an inflexible structure of feeling is the problem.</p>
        <p>If feminism is someone telling me, you, her or him how and what to 
          write-this is emphatically a problem in the cultural field. And insofar 
          as &quot;feminism&quot; has done this, it deserves to be criticized. 
          BUT it does not, however, deserve to be treated as if it were the only 
          set of conventions trying to impose themselves (and be imposing) in 
          a cultural field. Indeed, a newer, rawer ideology or praxis upthrust 
          or fissuring through the accepted is much more visible than the &quot;Old 
          Mountain&quot; of Ideologies that have Always (oh yes, and Already) 
          been &quot;there&quot; and are so scrunched in your cells and your landscapes 
          that you don't feel them, see them, or acknowledge their telling you 
          what to do, what to write, how to make it all come out. That's just 
          called &quot;good writing.&quot; Now think of <i>The Four Quartets</i>. 
          When people complain about the quick and sketchy invention of a set 
          of conventions made by writers calling themselves feminist, they need 
          a quick and sketchy dose of understanding how conventions occur-have 
          always occurred-- as historical formations out of cultural practices. 
        </p>
        <p>Arcade 15. This is why I am agnostic about the feminism of production, 
          but want to say a VERY strong positive word for the feminism of reception. 
          What does this mean? To maintain feminist (that is, gender-alert) RECEPTION 
          is crucial, not to insist that certain forms, styles, strategies, subjectivities, 
          themes are more female, feminine, male, masculine, gay, straight, queer 
          on the level of <i>production</i>. The feminism of <i>reception</i> 
          means a high level of analysis making legible gender materials and the 
          materials of other social matrices, and showing a subtle alertness to 
          the play of gender (plus) and its deep structures, in culture, everywhere. 
          Gender-alert, materialist-inflected <i>reception</i> is interested in 
          the discussion of social location not only of artists, but of genres, 
          discourses, images, textualities, ideologies, communities. Feminist 
          reception demands that everything that has been written needs multiple 
          modes of gender analysis. Feminist cultural poetics has, to date, primarily 
          engaged itself with <i>female</i> subjectivity and <i>female</i> agency, 
          but with the tools developed from this phase of feminist thinking, one 
          can begin to talk about male subjectivities and agency. Thinking about 
          gendered subjectivities, performative genderings, styles of femaleness 
          or maleness, sexualities as represented in artworks, thinking about 
          ideological attitudes to gender of any individual author are all modal 
          moves within the feminism of reception. </p>
        <p>Note-I am not calling for &quot;feminine reception,&quot; as Terence 
          Diggory called my position in his introduction to <i>The Scene of My 
          Selves: New Work on New York School Poets</i> (National Poetry Foundation, 
          2000) in which the title of my article is &quot;The Gendered Marvelous: 
          Barbara Guest, Surrealism, and Feminist Reception.&quot; That slip of 
          the pen (&quot;feminine reception&quot;) is his little accident within 
          ideology. A metonymic posy from Reception = Receptivity = Femininity= 
          Feminine.</p>
        <p>Note-the &quot;feminism of reception&quot; will be continuously alert 
          to the issue of erasure. As Elizabeth Treadwell points out in <i>Tripwire</i> 
          4, &quot;The problem of erasure is everreal. It is never, I've found, 
          that women weren't there [in literature], but that they were there and 
          it takes us forever to re-figure it out.&quot; And later: &quot;Those 
          of us who find ourselves figured as Other-in whatever era, in whatever 
          way: We are never silent to ourselves.&quot; <i>Tripwire</i> 4 (A Letter 
          to the Editor), Winter 2000-01, 180, 181. </p>
        <p>But this &quot;feminism of reception&quot; will try to position the 
          recovery of women artists as events in the general history of literature, 
          not solely or narrowly as an act for women. (This point from David Buuck, 
          <i>Tripwire</i> 3, 31)</p>
        <p>Arcade 16. Since &quot;feminism&quot; changed the cultural landscape, 
          willy nilly, there are plenty of people who are indifferent to &quot;feminism&quot; 
          and agnostic about &quot;women,&quot; but who have become, as you suggest, 
          a poetic &quot;nexus.&quot; This idea that you've enunciated is a very 
          important one. Dare one say a &quot;feminist&quot; nexus, taking &quot;feminism&quot; 
          to be an act in reception, not production-that is a &quot;nexus&quot; 
          read under the influence of feminism, a reading strategy that has allowed 
          us to become very very curious about the ways women poets have negotiated 
          their gender, within their writing and their poetic careers? &quot;Feminist 
          nexus&quot;? A number of those involved might not agree with that phrase. 
          &quot;Gender-inflected nexus&quot;-means a lot of very interesting women 
          writing each other and reading each other, but the phrase is dim and 
          jargon-esque. &quot;Women's Nexus&quot;? Well, nexus is a key word, 
          anyway. As Peter Quartermain and I said about <i>The Objectivist Nexus</i> 
          (University of Alabama Press, 1999)-the participants didn't have to 
          agree; they didn't have to like each other, nor be a school nor sign 
          a manifesto-but they had to be engaged with each others' work for the 
          majority of their writing life. Their work was magnetized by the fact 
          that a certain rubric was set in motion; their work got involved with 
          certain historical responsibilities-in this case the pressure of feminist 
          thought and action. The writers kept reading each other, kept poking 
          at each others' ideas, engaged, even if annoyed at the turn some took 
          in relation to each other. The idea of &quot;nexus&quot; seems thoroughly 
          apropos, allowing for the fact that not one set of linked terms in one 
          seminal essay is the propellant (which was the case for the Objectivists). 
          In Zukofksy's 1931 essay, the terms are objectivist, sincerity, and 
          objectification in relation to the materialist political/cultural movement 
          of communism, socialism and the progressive left. For the &quot;Female 
          Nexus,&quot; there are several terms and several waves of &quot;originating&quot; 
          interventions (around woman, gender, feminist, feminine-the latter as 
          in French theory) in relation to a materialist political/cultural movement 
          called second wave feminism. There does, indeed, seem to be a &quot;Female 
          Nexus.&quot; Alice Notley has recently argued the same thing. In conversation, 
          she calls all the women writing in this period &quot;the group without 
          a name.&quot; (I think she's said this in print too, but I can't find 
          it.) The critic Ann Vickery states: &quot;We need a map of Language 
          writing as a field of rich and diverse feminisms&quot;; she has gone 
          a long way towards providing a beginning. (<i>Leaving Lines of Gender: 
          A Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing</i>, Wesleyan UP, 200, 50) 
          Her topic is clearly this &quot;Female Nexus&quot; (though it is also 
          specificially &quot;Language&quot;women and not a wider field of innovation). 
        </p>
        <p>Can one call this &quot;feminine&quot;? This writing, marked by a greater 
          allegiance to the post-structuralist rupture of humanisms, selfhood, 
          and identity, and marked by the influence of experimental modernisms 
          has, in some criticism, gone by the name &quot;feminine.&quot; One might 
          thereupon have two attitudes-contradictory, of course. To call non-linear 
          structures, cross-generic experiment, collage, non-narrative play with 
          subjectivity, temporality, syntax-by the name of &quot;feminine&quot; 
          follows &quot;French feminism&quot; of Cixous and Irigaray. One could 
          nod approvingly, as does Joan Rettallack in her article in <i>Feminist 
          Measures</i>, accepting the word &quot;it is the women (among experimental 
          poets) who-for the first time in large numbers using &quot;feminine&quot; 
          formal processes-are presenting us with our strongest, most challenging 
          models of literary feminisms&quot; because they actively explore multiplicity, 
          unintelligibility, the &quot;articulation of silence&quot; and so on.375 
          Also, following Irigaray, the feminine is the principle of the transgressive, 
          and that which resists univeralisms of all sorts (346). So the female 
          use of the feminine is especially striking for Retallack; she calls 
          it the poethical. Her eponymous punning other, Genre Tallique says &quot; 
          Feminist writing occurs only when female writers use feminine forms&quot; 
          359, mainly because Tallique is overly concerned to avoid &quot;the 
          feminism of polemic&quot;(359 bottom) (That means that no man could 
          ever write a feminist work, even in feminine forms; this is a polemic 
          argument that is, in fact, quite exclusionary).</p>
        <p> Or one could dissent, uncooperatively, both from the original denomination 
          of the term feminine by Cixous and Irigaray-in my opinion they both 
          mean something like &quot;ecriture bisexuelle&quot; (essay on the essay) 
          and because the term feminine is too mixed up with its destructive elements, 
          at least for someone brought up in the 50s. If one wants to say transgressive, 
          resistant, anti-hegemonic, why not do so in as many words? And why not 
          call this transgression of women and about women's position in society 
          &quot;feminism&quot;? Why not be able to analyze just where Bram Stoker 
          or D.H. Lawrence was feminist and just where each could not go further 
          and became self-compromising and politically retrograde? One would, 
          of course, have to broaden this term as applying to forms of female 
          resistance in cultural products. I am not sure, but it appears that 
          Retallack wants to resist the term feminism as tainted (presumably by 
          Alicia Ostriker and other pioneers), while I want to resist the term 
          feminine as tainted.<br>
          Go to p. 245 of American Literary History.</p>
        <p>Of course, as soon as this attack on the term &quot;feminine&quot; 
          is complete, I find this citation from Cixous's &quot;Castration or 
          Decapitation&quot; (1981. Signs): &quot;A feminine textual body is recognized 
          by the fact that it is always endless, without ending: there's no closure, 
          it doesn't stop, and it's this that mat very often makes the feminine 
          text difficult to read. &#133;a feminine text starts on all sides at 
          once, starts twenty times, thirty times, over&quot; and I am so attracted 
          to this that the whole subject is open again. Probably one cannot use 
          the term feminine without at least acknowledging that we are not talking 
          about a stylistic marker here, but about a relationship to the body 
          of the mother-the feminine as access to the preoedipal desire. Another 
          tonality, other voices, the mishegoss on the page. So in that sense, 
          what does it mean that I write feminine texts but do not want to acknowledge 
          them as such? Am I denying the body of the mother and my desire. or 
          am I expressing ecriture bisexuelle, the struggle on the page between 
          the mother and the father tones, modes, authorities.</p>
        <p>What is this Female Nexus? It's the &quot;polygynous&quot; (post patriarchal?) 
          poetries within the years of, just after, and in some cases parallel 
          to the women's poetry movement and the feminist political movement-and 
          I use polygynous precisely to suggest the Kristevean polylogue, the 
          radical poetics of this group of writers. But historically, I would 
          factor in the propulsion from both the feminist movement in culture 
          and analysis and theory and &quot;the women's poetry movement&quot; 
          as an as-yet under-acknowledged spur. Some of the most fruitful moments 
          of women poets' exchanges on these issues came during the twenty-plus 
          years from the 1980s to the present under the rubric of &quot;innovative&quot;--when 
          at least multiple sets of women writers were engaged, at least sporadically, 
          in utopian projects, in their own Blue Studios--to examine what the 
          regime of gender-marking gave to culture and to see what the economy 
          of gender-investments gave. A tremendous number of fruitful cross-fertilizations 
          have emerged in the past two decades--kind of like everyone going into 
          the Tunnel of Love and coming out with different people's lipstick smudged 
          on them, and smudging in return. This has indeed been a very merry and 
          lively moment. There have also been those travelling, at times, through 
          opposite tunnels-tunnels of annoyance and ambivalence, of rage and suspicion. 
          But being in a nexus does not demand assent (see Oppen vs. Zukofsky); 
          it simply demands attentiveness, fixation, sureness that these poets 
          must be read. This &quot;nexus&quot; moment of great significance to 
          the consolidation of innovative women's writing as a practice is perhaps 
          best represented by Mary Margaret Sloan's <i>Moving Borders</i> anthology 
          (Talisman House, Publishers, 1998). But the Female Nexus came into being 
          as a &quot;nexus&quot; both in linkages between coterie formations (St 
          Mark's; early Language; <i>HOW(ever)</i>, ) but also in relation to 
          the &quot;women's poetry movement&quot; and the French feminist theory 
          interventions by which some of its work is marked (some of this is Vickery, 
          some is not). </p>
        <p>Arcade 17. A moment of silence. For the women who jumped from windows, 
          away from the blue.</p>
        <p>Arcade 18. If you are impatient with other women for having to go over 
          that ground again and again (&quot;the same old arguments simply recirculated 
          / regenerated or, even worse, left to stagnate&quot;) and then, if you 
          say that you didn't &quot;fully understand [at one point in your own 
          life] that my own thinking might be considered 'feminist,'&quot; take 
          a look at what you've said! These two statements construct a great generative 
          contradiction (saying 2 opposite things, A and not-A) from which you 
          might make a number of surmises and dialectical resolutions. One might 
          be patience with the positions of others. Though I know it is hard to 
          be that which is called, and calls itself feminist. You can become a 
          lighting rod for many a free floating electric strike. But if you were 
          once &quot;not&quot; (not quite) willing to say feminist about yourself, 
          you might see others the same way. Perhaps they will become your allies 
          in a little more time. And/or you might also allow that you could change 
          and not want to call yourself feminist. Though this seems unlikely.</p>
        <p>Arcade 19. Can one be a political feminist-committed to gender justice, 
          to resisting (as possible) hierarchies and inequalities based on gender, 
          privileges and constrictions in the social and economic realm AND also 
          be a cultural agnostic, demanding the interest of complexity? Can one 
          admire Olson's projects and his omnivorous claims, and resist a lot-almost 
          all-- of his gender politics? Can one encourage women to talk in class 
          when they often hold back, and then listen to them present mushy, even 
          ridiculous opinions about issues you hold dear? Can you protect the 
          right of a male student with an even higher sense of entitlement to 
          say even worse, stupid things? Of course. You can also outline the terms 
          of debates in all cases, the reasons people might want to rethink this 
          or that. Can one be rigorous and empathetic? Anti-simplistic, but with 
          clean lines; Can one illustrate opacity and confirm clarity at one and 
          the same time? You'd better believe it. </p>

        <p> Arcade 20 This exchange dates from 1978. &quot;Anne Waldman: I was 
          talking to Diane di Prima last week and she said that so many of the 
          talented women of that time and place (New York City or San Francisco 
          in the fifties) who could've blossomed, didn't because they were uninformed. 
          They just weren't getting the information from the so-called master 
          and male poets.&quot; Note the particularity of &quot;uninformed&quot;- 
          translated as-what? out of the loop? excluded? too identified with that 
          particular loop and unwilling to bond with other women? needing the 
          male to shepherd, chaperone, and otherwise connect you to the scene-not 
          allowed to connect yourself.</p>
        <p>&quot;Ted Berrigan: They didn't know how to convert this male information 
          to female value. &#133; But it was true, it wasn't a very good time 
          for women.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          From an interview by Anne Waldman &amp; Jim Cohn of Ted Berrigan (August 
          1978):<br>

        <p>Note how the flaw has passed from men's not including/ informing women 
          (that is, from clubbiness and exclusivity) to women not able to convert 
          whatever information they were getting. This is a slide from being a 
          &quot;men's problem&quot; or a problem between men and women to being 
          solely a &quot;women's problem.&quot; Notice the statement of difference-male 
          information must get converted to female value, in order to be useful 
          to women. I am not saying he's wrong or right (women might feel enabled 
          by at least having a place of difference in this array); I'm just looking 
          at the structure of feeling. There are no &quot;just human&quot; people 
          here; these are definitely gendered folks, acting in ways rather sharply 
          differentiated by gender. Note how, after a little material that I cut 
          (not on this subject) the subject of women's exclusion comes back, the 
          return of the repressed. &quot;It wasn't a very good time for women&quot;-a 
          firm litotes. Not only a pensive understatement, but also another glissade-why 
          is such a situation &quot;not a very good time for men and women&quot;? 
          Why indeed. The answer is in ideology: women are women's problems. Men's 
          attitudes are women's problems. Women are the repository of everyone's 
          &quot;gender problems,&quot; and they are the synecdochic marker for 
          such problems. Men, presumably, do not have gender problems; they are 
          neither responsible for such problems nor do they have any agency in 
          facing the issues.</p>
        <p>Time for the wake up call-do we want it to revert to not &quot;being 
          a very good time for women&quot;?</p>

        <p>Arcade 21. So, you ask, am I a feminist poet? The easiest answer is 
          yes. But in fact, only in certain ways. Only by certain of the criteria, 
          above. I would resist some of the others. An easier question is, am 
          I part of the Female Nexus. There the answer is emphatically yes.</p>
        <p>I am certainly a feminist who is a poet. I have had some feminist projects 
          in poetry, notably the revisionary myth poems &quot;Eurydice&quot; and 
          &quot;Medusa,&quot; in <i>Wells</i> and &quot;Crowbar,&quot; in <i>Tabula 
          Rosa</i>. &quot;Crowbar&quot; is a work that angrily and thrillingly 
          takes on the voice of the &quot;Lady&quot; in<i> trobar clus</i> poetry, 
          but she uses a language crowbar to pry up and resist ideology about 
          female figures. It's both overtly feminist and verbally tricky, radical 
          and elegant. (&quot;Crowbar&quot; is my anthology piece, Susan Howe 
          once winningly told me, but it was never in the anthologies it should 
          have been in. It, and the poem &quot;Writing&quot; are works of significant 
          leverage and turn in my writing.) My current project is inflected with 
          gender resistance to some of the &quot;scripts&quot; or ideologies of 
          poetry as an institution. I'd say, to cite Arcade13, that I have found 
          myself &quot;mounting an enormous struggle&quot; within culture, including 
          poetry, because of its deeply constitutive gender ideas. <br>
          <br>
          My long poem <i>Drafts</i> has been going on since about 1985-86-so 
          2001 makes them 15 or 16 years old. I am rounding into having written 
          about 47 of them (an average of 3 per year-this statistic is mildly 
          interesting to me-I am curious about all the little functional details 
          and deep positional feelings of writing a long poem). The feeling of 
          doing this work is sublime: it is a readied, incorporative, flexible, 
          and open form, that is also a grid of relationships. As you know Wesleyan 
          is bringing out <i>Drafts 1-38, Toll</i> in just a few months (October 
          2001), and I am composing the next group of nineteen (the next &quot;fold&quot;), 
          <i>Drafts 39-57</i>. Drafts is poetry that at the same time as it reaches 
          deeply and saturatedly into poetic traditions of all kinds, wants enormously 
          to resist &quot;poetry&quot; and to reconfigure what it can do, how 
          it is regarded, and what its scope and meanings are. I really want to 
          write (as Oppen did) a poetry of critique. Of driven, stricken skepticism. 
          This is a large thing to say, and thinking the poem will be judged and 
          read against this kind of statement makes me---not frightened, but happy. 
        </p>
        <p>Arcade 22. My poetry has been a way, for a long time, of thinking about 
          gender. But some of these thoughts are registered indirectly. Thus-generally 
          I work with gender not directly through statement and image and theme 
          (though sometimes I do), but obliquely through consideration of the 
          constitutive structuring materials of any poetic text set in a critical, 
          responsive relationship to poetic tradition. For example, each of the 
          new poems that I am currently writing is dedicated to a specific person; 
          thus the works in <i>Drafts 39-57</i> construct a variety of &quot;I-you&quot; 
          relations not typical of the power and gender ideas often expressed 
          in short lyrics, in which &quot;I&quot;/author has the power of the 
          word in relation to the &quot;you&quot;/listener, a generally female 
          figure. Instead, the poems create a varying inter-subjective space between 
          addressee and speaker. The creation of a &quot;space of the between&quot; 
          has a gender meaning in eroding the former I/you relations of poetry. 
        </p>
        <p>Feminist ideas about the position of women in discourse, conventions, 
          and culture, the works of certain male and female writers, and the position 
          of female figures inside poems are materials that I have examined throughout 
          my scholarly career; indeed, my critical work has helped to foreground 
          these issues. Some of the same concerns animate my poetry. I want consciously 
          to alter gender traditions that have been institutionalized as poetry 
          itself inside poems, often providing their climax, their justification, 
          their satisfactions. I mean such idea-embodiments as muse, female figures 
          and their relationship to language, poetess, male speakers/ female listeners 
          or recipients, poetry as transcendence of the real, even &quot;feminine&quot; 
          rhyme as lesser, light, comic, popular. With my poetry, as with my scholarship 
          and my essays, <i>Pink Guitar</i>-ish interventions, I want, essentially, 
          to change poetry and to change how poetry is understood.</p>
        <p>Arcade 23. To name the whole work and its individual cantos &quot;drafts&quot; 
          is to make a statement about this praxis (alias, genre). I start from 
          the metaphoric presumption of provisionality--these poems are pretended 
          (and it is a generative and wonderful pretense) as &quot;unfinished.&quot; 
          That means that none is perfect, iconic, static-something, as I just 
          said, that has gender meaning for me as a criticism of the uses of the 
          female/feminine in a good deal of the poetic tradition. As <i>Drafts</i>, 
          these poems are open to their own revision and disassembling. The interest 
          in having no stasis, having so much in any poem, having links and ties 
          to prior work in the series all ruptures the iconic. I desire to create 
          hybridity and mixed kinds of texts.</p>
        <p>I am building a work that mimics memory, that plays with the textures 
          of memory, including its unexpectedness, its flashes, its fragmentations, 
          and its erasures. I do this emotional and thematic work in two main 
          formal and structural principles that help me construct memory formally, 
          and as well, help me formulate individual units within the grid-like 
          space in which this poem now takes shape. First, I create linkage by 
          randomly repeating lines and images throughout, a recontextualization 
          of materials and a building of traces that eventually gives the reader 
          the feeling of having heard it all before. This sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; 
          vu is quite important to the main thematics of the work. This repetitive 
          repositioning of material goes with genre in that it suggests that any 
          one poem is only a &quot;draft&quot; of something else that is palpable 
          but unattainable. Second, the works are organized on a periodicity of 
          nineteen, with a structural idea I've called &quot;the fold.&quot; Discovering 
          that I wanted to do this was a stroke of tremendous luck, in a poem 
          in which all the choices have been made on the ground, in the doing 
          of the act of writing. (Here an analogue is Robin Blaser's <i>Image 
          Nations</i>.) Beginning with &quot;Draft 20: Incipit,&quot; each new 
          draft corresponds in some sensuous, formal, intellectual, allusive way 
          to a specific &quot;donor&quot; draft. This tactic creates a regular, 
          though widely spaced, recurrence among the poems, and a chained or meshed 
          linkage whose regularity is both predictable and suggestive, textured 
          with internal relationships, yet making the work malleable and porous. 
          So the poems hold together in a grid, something that has strong analogues 
          to contemporary art, but within that grid, there is elasticity and variation. 
          Both the tactic of randomized repetition--recurrence of lines, phrases, 
          situations, words--and the &quot;folding&quot; of one unit of nineteen 
          poems over another are ways of making the work act like a gigantic memory 
          of itself. </p>
        <p>These formal tactics make the already-written poems the &quot;muses&quot; 
          for the next work. Speaking, already spoken lines and words are muses 
          for the next poems. I cannot emphasize this strongly enough. The structure 
          of repetition and folding makes related drafts stand as muses for themselves: 
          the poems already written are the muses for the unwritten. This short-circuits 
          the issue of the silent female muse-figure well-known in poetic tradition 
          but whose silence and semi-visibility are very problematic for actual 
          women writing, women like myself. </p>
        <p>Arcade 24. <i>Drafts</i> responds thematically and structurally, in 
          texture and in conception, to memory and time. But the work wants to 
          resist the memorializing functions often ascribed to poetry, and especially 
          to lyric poetry. <i>Drafts</i> therefore undertakes the task of replicating 
          the open-ended displacements and random waywardness of memory, rather 
          than making an iconic object that eulogizes what is lost. Since these 
          iconic objects are both poems (in the extra-diegetic) and female figures 
          (inside the poem, in the diegetic)-the resistance to the iconic is in 
          a general and loose way based in a gender critique. This is, and I've 
          argued this before, my resistance to the &quot;pure lyric hit&quot;-that 
          narrow, lovely thing-a feminist resistance that sees that kind of poem 
          as working with deeply imbedded ideas about female and feminine. That 
          I've overstated this does not make the idea less powerful for myself. 
        </p>
        <p>My critique of lyric in my own mind can be organized more largely as 
          this kind of resistance: from W. G. Sebald, <i>Rings of Saturn</i> (New 
          Directions, 1998, 194). &quot;at times it seems to me&#133;as if all 
          works of art were coated with a sugar glaze or indeed made completely 
          of sugar.&quot; That is precisely the artwork I do not want to write. 
          Nor, mainly, do I want to consume anything like it when I read or see 
          artworks.<br>
          <br>
          There is no doubt that poly-interruptibility and a sense of multiple 
          vectors, the collaging of these, the play with &quot;sequence of disclosure&quot; 
          and rhythms of understanding mark my work in both poetry and the essay. 
          I have also made a serious gender critique of the &quot;lyric tradition&quot; 
          and want to encircle, rupture, torque, destabilize lyric poetry as such. 
          But, carefully (and with a little help from my friends-Hank Lazer and 
          Nathaniel Mackey), I do not reject &quot;lyricism&quot; or melody as 
          one effect built among many in a poem (sound, segmentivities, charms--though 
          I do emphatically reject the charming, the decorative, the pretty. I 
          have a principled resistance to &quot;beauty&quot; as a marker of verse, 
          a serious claim of dissent and resistance, but my creolizations are 
          not ignorant of beauty. Nor do I reject syntax as one means of directing 
          attention, the &quot;sequence of disclosure&quot;-in George Oppen's 
          wonderful phrase (<i>Sagetrieb</i> 3, 3 [Winter 1984], 26). I am fascinated 
          by the way syntax intersects with and interacts with any poetic line 
          or unit of segmentivity. I use sentence <i>and</i> fragment, argument 
          and disjunction, putting rapture next to rupture, so to speak. I want 
          the passion, sense of the ethics of writing synthesized with discursive 
          variability, and linguistic/ textual creolization.</p>
        <p>Arcade 25. My critique of lyric in my own mind might also be articulated 
          under Theodor Adorno's famous &quot;After Auschwitz to write [lyric] 
          poetry is barbaric.&quot;(<i>Prisms</i>, The MIT Press 1983, 34) (I 
          am strangely aware as I write this to you that your name is Barbara, 
          and you have been given some secret stake in this debate.) This complex 
          statement has had many midrashic glosses made upon it, as well it must. 
          Not the least are several by Adorno himself, some of which misquote 
          himself to deny that &quot;after Auschwitz you could no longer write 
          poems.&quot; (See Negative Dialectics, 362, as cited by Lyn Hejinian 
          in <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>-for her midrash, see the essay &quot;Barbarism&quot; 
          [University of California Press, 2000]; but also see <i>Shaping Losses: 
          Cultural Memory and the Holocaust</i>, eds. Julia Epstein and Lori Hope 
          Lefkovitz; 204 has Julia Epstein's midrash [University of Illinois Press, 
          2001].) Of course, his emphasis is not so much on lyric but on the barbarous 
          and the barbarity of Shoah and the sheer inadequacy of any artwork in 
          the light of such a reality. </p>
        <p>But in terms of the impact of this magisterial comment on praxis, here 
          is my particular midrash at this moment. I no longer write lyric poetry, 
          but am engaged in a complex and odic/ ex-odic heterogeneric work, resisting 
          &quot;pretty poetry&quot; and little poetry-this resistance, as I've 
          mentioned, being (for me) also feminist in origin. This makes a double 
          resistance to the lyric, or to the lyric only. This means something 
          about &quot;genre&quot;-or, to say it with a less static feeling, something 
          about the rubric under I currently put my praxis. There are, in all 
          the <i>Drafts</i>, &quot;debris&quot; and &quot;fragment&quot;--a formal 
          and an ethical issue coinciding. These words are used by the mid-century 
          German philosopher Walter Benjamin. One presiding presence in this work 
          is his angel of history, displaced in the storm blowing the angel backwards 
          into the future, while it is still staring stunned at events and their 
          unfixable detritus (&quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History,&quot; 
          <i>Illuminations</i>, Schocken Books, 1969).</p>
        <p>I want in this light to mention that gender is not the only social 
          location for the subjectivity writing <i>Drafts</i> nor for the subjectivities 
          created in them. Curiously (to myself), quondam Jewishness-a very secular, 
          skeptical cultural Jewishness-is important. Thus I am haunted by moral 
          nightmare, ambiguities about authority, and the demand for awe made 
          by the Abraham and Isaac story, alluded to in &quot;Draft 25: Segno&quot; 
          and elsewhere. As is Unitedstateness, given the compromises and strange 
          estrangements of that global privilege. Thus I am being haunted, by 
          homelessness in &quot;Draft 24: Gap,&quot; and the sense of moral or 
          ethical losses of community. I am haunted by the &quot;outsider&quot; 
          artist (&quot;Draft 22: Philadelphia Wireman&quot;), whose powerful 
          wire sculptures came close to being lost, thrown out with the trash. 
          As is a spiritual yearning and awe to which I do NOT give the name of 
          any existing (or future) religious formation or allegiance. Figured 
          too are the vastness of the universe and the littleness of the dot, 
          or letter, or self, something that appears in these works repeatedly, 
          as a pinhole, as &quot;any bit of fleck along the crack&quot; (in &quot;Draft 
          24: Gap&quot;), as the (smallest) Hebrew letter, &quot;yod,&quot; and 
          in other guises. There is also a strange thing to say-the social privilege 
          and location of being alive and well enough to say all this, to say 
          anything I can in the time it takes, given the existence not of real 
          ghosts but of ghostly traces of those without most of this privilege. 
          I am haunted by the losses of many people in the holocausts of the twentieth 
          century, represented over and over in my work, for instance in the &quot;hoops 
          of unforgiveable bone&quot; in &quot;Draft XXX: Fosse,&quot; in &quot;ghosts 
          of ghosts at the open fosse&quot; in &quot;Draft 27: Athwart.&quot; 
          Many of these poems speak of the enormousness of the universe, and the 
          enormities of what has happened in our milky corner of it. These are 
          haunted poems, poems of commitment. </p>
