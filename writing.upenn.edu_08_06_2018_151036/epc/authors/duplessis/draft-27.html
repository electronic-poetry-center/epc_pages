Next day, cyclonic rains,
           from which the tree, 
an oak of sixty feet
           and sixty years, fell down.
           A tilted force pushed through the winds of ferocity.
Its final muffled noise and muted rush
                                 were quick,
                                            a surprise how reverberant,
                                 how hard to assimilate.</font></pre>

                                There was a time 
                     up thru November 10
           wherein the tree
                                          just was, its oakish life 
                               as such.
                   One storm and
one thud. It's the work of a moment.
                                            An &quot;event.&quot;

His memory has emptied.

the blood-dark leaf?
