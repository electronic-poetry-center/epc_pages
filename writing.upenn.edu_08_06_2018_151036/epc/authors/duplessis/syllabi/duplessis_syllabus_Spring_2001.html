              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking three 
                sites for investigation and spending three-four weeks on each, 
                this course will discuss poems and poetics, examining the gender 
                issues that occur in literary texts and in their surround--manifesto 
                claims, group formations, critical writing and letters by poets, 
                and other institutions of poetry as a practice. The three sites 
                will be 1) early Anglo-American modernism (1910-1925/30)--considering 
                work by Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Mina Loy, H.D., Marianne Moore 
                2) post-WWII United States &quot;Projective&quot; verse of the 
                1950s, considering mainly Charles Olson but also Frances Boldereff 
                and Robert Creeley 3) the New York School, {SEE REVISION the &quot;uptown&quot; 
                work of John Ashbery, and} the &quot;downtown&quot; St. Marks 
                formation of the 1960s-1970s and later, with poetry by Ted Berrigan 
                and Alice Notley and Anne Waldman being a focus. Alice Notley 
                will be in residence for a week in February under the auspices 
                of the Creative Writing Program, and we will invite her to talk 
                to us about some of these issues. We will head up the course with 
                some feminist theory about poetry. My original plan for doing 
                French Surrealism in addition to the three formations considered 
                above had to be scrapped when I actually looked at the course 
                and its time frames.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This course 
                will offer the opportunity for original research, argument and 
                critical thinking. Students have a choice of two exploratory papers 
                of about 10-15 pp. or one (circa) 30 page paper conceived of as 
                a critical intervention (with the ultimate goal of having publishable 
                work). In addition, some other pages of writing or preparation 
                will occur: 5 critical summaries, one oral report on readings 
                in Olson's poetry, and one letter about your research plans. Class 
                discussion and oral reports will be based on the summaries. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By gender 
                issues in literature I mean at least ideas and representations 
                of maleness and femaleness, manhood, womanhood, femininity and 
                masculinity, ideas of queering or destabilizing gender binaries 
                and normative sexuality, uses of female, male and ambiguous figures 
                in poetry, gender ideologies and their social and theoretical 
                resonance, sexualities, and debates around sexuality in modernity, 
                including issues of representation. Most of these issues were 
                put into play by varieties of feminist criticism and gay and lesbian 
                criticism. Ideas of gender (etc.) are not static and they alter 
                over time, by virtue of changing historical conditions, different 
                ideological models and shifts in social norms. They may be contradictory 
                in the work of an individual poet, as well. Gender materials can 
                be marked inside a literary text. Emphasis on gender/ sexuality 
                will not be exclusive, for we will, if necessary, examine and 
                incorporate attention to other social locations.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In proposing 
                gender as a basic problem and an essential category in cultural 
                and historical analysis, feminists have recast the issue of women's 
                relative identity as equally an issue for men, who, upon ceasing 
                to be mankind, become, precisely, men. Thus gender has emerged 
                as a problem that is always implicit in any work.&quot; Myra Jehlen,

                &quot;AW: I was talking to Diane di Prima last week and she said 
                that so many of the talented women of that time and place (New 
                York City or San Francisco in the fifties) who could've blossomed, 
                didn't because they were uninformed. They just weren't getting 
                the information from the so-called master and male poets.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TB: They didn't 
                know how to convert this male information to female value. &#133; 
                But it was true, it wasn't a very good time for women.&quot; In

                <b>Work due in course</b><br>
                1 .Procedures for the course. All students will write five one-page 
                summaries of one of the critical articles. To do this, you will 
                follow the guidelines, attached. Pick articles that appeal to 
                you intellectually, because this work, over five weeks, will help 
                you develop and write your papers. These will be collected every 
                relevant week. This is noted with (Critical reading summary) in 
                the syllabus. Sometimes there will be critical readings (reviews, 
                etc.) by the poets; these are not to be used for summaries. The 
                summaries concern secondary sources. You'll notice that the summaries 
                slow down towards the end of the semester, when you are working 
                on your paper(s).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. All students 
                will report on a chunk of poetry by Olson, in our gender scan 
                of his shorter poems; this will occur over three weeks, reading 
                through his non-Maximus poems. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. All students 
                will have at least one conference during the early part of the 
                semester, between January 16 and February 20, but definitely before 
                Spring Break. The material to be covered in this conference will 
                be your work to date and your possible paper topic(s)</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Papers. 
                Option: two shorter papers. These papers are minimum 10 and maximum 
                15 pages each. This process begins with a Research Plan (in the 
                form of a letter), due in March right after Spring Break. If the 
                two paper option is chosen, the first paper will be due no later 
                than April 3 and the second paper will be due on April 24. Students 
                exercising the two paper option will have a conference after April 
                3, and before their second paper is in its final stages. For both 
                sets of students, there will be a mini-conference presenting your 
                findings, in class on April 24. <br>
                The two options can be distinguished by the particular intellectual 
                needs of the student. All students who have not studied much poetry 
                before, all students whose main interest is developing readings 
                (possibly creative writing students or students preparing Ph.D. 
                lists) should consider this option. Obviously, the short summaries 
                will contribute to your thinking. Two paper option: students must 
                treat the 20th century poets on this list. The work must be informed 
                by gender issues (or gender-plus); the papers need to discuss 
                method (other critical/theoretical readings, probably the ones 
                we have suggested on the syllabus), must focus on texts (close 
                reading), and may treat other writings by the poet and critical 
                writings about the text, evaluated for engagement with the text 
                and with gender issues. Before settling on a topic, students must 
                consult with me at the conference in the early part of the semester 
                (see above).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Papers. 
                Option: one long paper. Students exercising the one paper option 
                will usually be more mature students ready to work on a publishable 
                paper. This process begins with a Research Plan (in the form of 
                a letter), due in March right after Spring Break. If the one long 
                paper option is chosen, the due date is April 24. There will be 
                a mini-conference presenting your findings, in class on April 
                24. <br>
                The two options can be distinguished by the particular intellectual 
                needs of the student. Students completing their course work, students 
                for whom this is a major approach of interest could plan on consolidating 
                their work in a potentially publishable paper. This paper need 
                not treat the poets on this list (although we must agree on what 
                you have picked and why, and you should treat closely related 
                poets), but it (of course) should do work informed by gender(-plus) 
                issues. This paper (minimum 23 and maximum 30 pages long) would 
                need to discuss method (other critical/theoretical readings), 
                texts (close reading), other writings by the poet especially as 
                these indicate gender issues in institutions of production, dissemination, 
                reception (research in ancillary documents), and it must make 
                some critique or acknowledgement of the existing criticism on 
                that author or text, a task involving a serious bibliography. 
                Before finally settling on a topic, students must consult with 
                me at the conference in the early part of the semester (see above).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As best as 
                I can figure it, the mini-papers at 5% each count for about 30% 
                of the work done in the course and (if a large paper is chosen) 
                that paper is 70%; if two shorter papers are chosen, they are 
                35% each. The Research Plan may get evaluated in relation to the 
                paper. These are guidelines only, because they don't allow for 
                classwork (i.e. talking), which is, of course, somewhat based 
                on your mini-papers. If you are doing two papers and your grades 
                differ wildly, they will be tipped towards the latter part of 
                the semester. I hope I don't have to mention that you are not 
                to cut class. </font></p>

                Research Plan due (in letter form). Every class for the next three 
                classes, a fixed amount of time will be devoted to scanning Olson's 
                poetry (excluding Maximus) for your gender ideas about his work. 
                The proposition is that to really understand a poet's work under 
                any rubric (i.e., gender), you need to read it in bulk, and not 
                depend on anthology pieces pre-selected by editors who may have 
                neither your intellectual interests nor your questions. This class 
                reading pp. 1-211, The Collected Poems of Charles Olson, ed. George 
                Butterick. Also the introduction. When you are assigned to speak,
