          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Course description: 
            A graduate level study of issues in poetry and poetics, combined with 
            a survey of important genres, their texts, and their critics. The 
            course is designed to have you read some key work of poets central 
            to a sense of Anglo-American traditions--interpreting the word &quot;traditions&quot; 
            broadly and widely--so that you become familiar with such genres and 
            modes of thought as the sonnet, the elegy, the pastoral, the ode, 
            the satire, the lyric. Special emphasis on poetry as a material text, 
            including the editorial production of that text, and the issue of 
            sound and the auditory imagination. The issues the course will raise 
            include the nature and history of poetic form (poetic diction and 
            convention, genre, meter); intertextualities and poetic representation; 
            the relations among form, subjectivity, and ideology (including class, 
            gender, perhaps religious culture); the construction of authorship. 
            Readings in poems are sometimes complemented by some suggested reading 
            in contemporary critical writing relevant to these poetic texts. Five 
            shorter papers, two on an older texts and one on genre or mode in 
            contemporary poetics, one a write-up of a report, and one a take-home 
            &quot;final.&quot; This course has a lot of agendas: introductory 
            (to poetry), historical, generic, textual (bibliographic), textual 
            (close reading), and the general question of the cultural work accomplished 
            in any poem.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prerequisites: 
            All students must be matriculated graduate students in the English 
            Department, M.A. or Ph.D. programs.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Necessary books 
            and materials on reserve are listed below. I will also give several 
            &quot;guidelines&quot;-instructions and design specs for papers, and 
            a handout on issues in poetry (the latter a familiar one for 790 students). 
            I've done my best to select pertinent articles; if something changes, 
            I will alter the syllabus. Incidentally, some of these critical readings 
            are difficult, challenging, We will all do the best we can with them. 
            Don't back off, but don't be too hard on yourselves if it takes a 
            while to feel as if you are beginning to get it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reading Assignments 
            should be completed before coming to class. While most are in the 
            Norton, the other required readings are on &quot;Blackboard&quot;-a 
            web-based course file. Thus, in order to access the course readings, 
            you must have a Temple University e-mail account. In fact, all Temple 
            students are required to have a Temple email account. Even if this 
            is not your account of choice, you must get one in order to do course 
            readings. Students will also be asked to provide focused class participation; 
            I may assign topics on a round-robin basis. There are often many more 
            poems assigned for a day than will be discussed in class. I have done 
            this to give you a sense of groupings of poems, to incite you to look 
            into certain texts on your own, and to inspire papers. I've also done 
            this so you can read in depth in these poetic traditions. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsibilities 
            of every student: to have read, as completely as is plausible, the 
            texts for that week. If there is a problem of any kind, please e-mail 
            me. Other things &quot;Blackboard&quot; can provide for us is an instant 
            course listserv. We might have occasion to use this. I am not sure 
            whether I want papers on-line or not. I don't care whether you print 
            out readings so long as you have read them. A few things may be on 
            reserve. On reserve means at Paley Library, Main Desk. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Disability: Students 
            with need for accomodations based on the impact of a documented disability 
            should tell me, and, to help coordinate reasonable accomodations, 
            should also contact the Office of Disability Services (100 Ritter 
            Annex) at 215-204-1280 or see the Temple University website at http://www.temple.edu/disability/</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participation: 
            This is a graduate course. You should neither miss class nor be late. 
            Missing even one class is cause for my serious, invasive concern and 
            may lower your grade. Lateness is unacceptable. Students will have 
            one chance to do an in-class presentation. It is crucial that students 
            be well prepared for their reports, and they might possibly be prepared 
            to share certain written work (announced later). You should see me 
            at least once during the semester (office hours or by appointment) 
            to discuss your work in the course. <br>
            <br>
            Writing Assignments and Requirements: a total of 5, divided as follows: 
            3 shorter papers, 1 close reading, given as a presentation in class 
            (oral report and notes to me), 1 take-home final (written as a working 
            paper). The take-home final is due on the last day of class. Due dates 
            are as follows:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) There will 
            be three formal essays (approximately 8-10 pages each). Of these three 
            shorter papers, two will be on an older text and some critical frame 
            and one on genre or mode in contemporary poetry and poetics in relation 
            to genre/mode in &quot;earlier&quot; materials. For the latter papers, 
            I have ordered three recommended books. Other books can be used with 
            my permission, so long as the contemporary writer is engaged with 
            the relevant issues of genre or mode germane to this course. I have 
            offered some specific topics keyed to readings and issues. The papers 
            will be meditative, critical and/or scholarly. They might involve 
            some application or consideration of the ancillary critical readings. 
            They might be close readings or ideologically invested readings. The 
            papers can be written in any tone of voice you fancy (including use 
            of the pronoun &quot;I&quot;), with any mixture of genres that seems 
            pertinent. You can even write an essay-poem. The only rule is that 
            the papers must perform interesting and pertinent analyses on the 
            general topics of the course. A few other design specifications for 
            these papers will be given later. These papers will be targeted as 
            due on September 30, October 21 and November 18. The only exception 
            is if you happen to be giving a report on one of those dates. Then 
            your paper will be due the next class; your working notes will be 
            due that day.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
            2) The close reading you give will have working notes; you'll hand 
            these in to me the day you give your report. Structure these notes 
            top down-main points, arguments are front-loaded. Then suggest examples. 
            This is like writing an exam. Flexible due date (that is, this depends 
            on when you give an oral report; working notes are due the day you 
            give the report). </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) There will 
            be a take-home &quot;final,&quot; due as a working paper on the last 
            day of class, and written using the critical resources for that day. 
            The question is &quot;What is poetry?&quot; Due December 2.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Learning Outcomes: 
            graduate level reading, speaking and writing skills will be modeled, 
            acquired, and reinforced. The topic on which these skills will be 
            tested is the history of Anglo-American poetry. You might learn other 
            things, beyond what is required to be specified by bureaucracy.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evaluation and 
            Grading: it is not really appropriate in graduate courses to offer 
            a percentage breakdown for grading, especially as growth is expected 
            during the semester. However, there are 5 tasks to do (aside from 
            general course participation); you might therefore think of each as 
            roughly 20% of the grade. In all graduate courses, along with the 
            final grade, instructors are required to write an evaluative report 
            on every student. This report goes in your file, which is kept by 
            the program in which you are matriculated. You will receive a copy 
            of these comments from me at the end of the semester, along with your 
            grade. You have access to this part of your file (but not to your 
            admissions packet with its confidential letters). If you are curious 
            what other instructors have said about you, or if you want to check 
            that all instructors have submitted these letters in a timely fashion 
            (sometimes not a bad idea), see whomever is the Creative Writing secretary, 
            or Belinda-Wilson Hagins, Graduate Program. If you are receiving financial 
            aid, it behooves you to check whether all letters have come in from 
            the prior semester.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, in 
            all graduate courses, you have an opportunity to evaluate the instructor 
            on University-mandated forms that are distributed in class at the 
            end of the semester. (Your evaluations are not seen by the instructor 
            until after grades are filed; instructor gets encoded copies only.)

            -the impact of literary criticism on poetic reputation and canon formation 
            is especially interseting in the case of John Donne as an exemplary 
            &quot;metaphysical&quot; poet. Take two stages of his poetic reputation--the 
            Samuel Johnson, and the T. S. Eliot; complement these with your own, 
            or another's feminist discussion of Donne.<br>
            -check out the other poems on impotence (note 3, p. 296) and do a 
            study of them as one unit, discussing Behn's use of pastoral motifs<br>
            -Do a study of Juvenalesque satires on the female body (of which Swift's 
            poem is one example). is there some psychoanalytic theory (i.e. Freud 
            on the debasement of the love object) that seems apropos? </font></p>

            -It is a curiosity of the meditative tradition, especially in the 
            16-17th centuries that a number of the poets did not circulate their 
            poems during their lifetimes, but were discovered post mortem (this 
            is true of Traherne, Edward Taylor, Emily Dickinson). Discuss the 
            relationships (contradictions?) between meditation and publication.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Issues about 
            Dickinson's texts and her textual practices are currently of great 
            interest. Taking one or more of the Norton-printed figure out the 
            impact of any variant words as seen in the variorum (three volume) 
            edition, and figure out the visual impact of the text as rendered 
            in Dickinson's own handwritten (holographic) presentation. For the 
            variant words, see Thomas H. Johnson, ed. variorum edition of The 
            Poems of Emily Dickinson in three volumes (The Belknap Press of Harvard 
            University, 1955). For the holographic presentation in the little 
            fascicle books Dickinson herself made see R.W. Franklin, ed. The Manuscript 
            Books of Emily Dickinson in two volumes (The Belknap Press of Harvard 
            University , 1981). Track attention to these materials in recent Dickinson

            say thematically in her work about the business of being female? About 
            femininity, about or around sexuality, the maternal, the girl child.What 
            is Dickinson's relation to the gender materials of the poetic tradition

            and not as a mere representation of the object named or outburst of
