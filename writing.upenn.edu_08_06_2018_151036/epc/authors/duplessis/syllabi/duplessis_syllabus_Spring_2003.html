            The Modern and Contemporary American Long Poem. Some kind of taxonomy 
            by example of mainly post-World War II United States long poems--late 
            modernist and contemporary--with the goals of offering introductory 
            readings of complex works (coverage), of acknowledging some under-read 
            works along with some of the usual suspects (canon), of considering 
            the poetics of the long poem, its textuality, and its cultural meanings 
            in each case. In addition, we will survey some of the basic critical 
            writings that take up the twentieth century long poem. The course 
            will be a seminar, with student reports on the work's textures and 
            on critical debate. Writing skills necessary for successful graduate 
            work will be addressed and improved. Because of the length and difficulty 
            of the readings, this course is not for the faint-hearted.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Primary Texts: 
            All have been ordered at Temple Bookstore, Student Activities Center.

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Necessary books 
            and materials on reserve are listed below. I will also give several 
            &quot;guidelines&quot;-through-lines in this course, how to read the 
            criticism, and issues in poetry (the latter a familiar one for 790 
            students). I've done my best to select pertinent articles; if something 
            changes, I will alter the syllabus. Some of these poets will have 
            significant articles written about them in Dictionary of Literary 
            Biography (various series); you would benefit from consulting them. 
            The contemporary poets will have a website at http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Participation: 
            This is a graduate course. Missing even one class is cause for my 
            serious, invasive concern. Lateness is unacceptable. Students will 
            have several chances to do mini-oral reports. There will also be pauses 
            for theoretical and literary-critical gatherings and summaries of 
            articles and other materials. On these matters, further written instructions 
            will be given. It is crucial that students be well prepared both for 
            their mini-reports and for the reports or workshops on the critical 
            literature, and be prepared to share certain written work that summarizes, 
            synthesizes, and lays out the issues as presented in prior criticism. 
            This professional responsibility the course will allow you to practice. 
            <br>
            Writing:<br>
            1) Students will write up their mini-reports (close reading) as a 
            2-3 page working paper. <br>
            2) Students will report with summaries and/or critiques on critical 
            articles or work in poetics, about 2 pages, single-spaced. These will 
            be handed in. Further, all will write summaries for Jan 29 and February 
            26. Because of &quot;time,&quot; some students will NOT report but 
            will present written summaries to the class, and will act as interlocutor 
            to the reporter. <br>
            3) Students will choose one poem on the syllabus to write about with 
            a focused topic of their choosing. This paper must be a minimum of 
            15 pages; it can go up to a full-dress account, article-length (25-30 
            pp.). This depends on where you are in the program and what you need 
            the paper for. M.A. students are required to submit a rough draft 
            of this paper or some section of it. Ph.D. students may do this as 
            well.<br>
            4) Students may also, with my permission, write this paper about other 
            long poems that fall within this time frame. These might include T.S. 
            Eliot, Four Quartets; Melvin Tolson, Libretto for the Republic of 
            Liberia; Ezra Pound, The Pisan Cantos; Charles Olson, (a selection 
            from) Maximus Poems; Louis Zukofsky (a selection from) &quot;A&quot;; 
            Muriel Rukeyser, &quot;The Book of the Dead,&quot; in U.S. 1; Susan 
            Howe, The Liberties; Robert Creeley, Pieces; Robert Duncan, Passages 
            (passim in the oeuvre); Jack Spicer [your choice of serial poem], 
            Robin Blaser, Image-Nations; bpNichol, The Martyrology; Ron Silliman, 
            Ketjak, Tjanting or other of The Alphabet; John Ashbery, Three Poems, 
            Anne Waldman, Iovis, Wallace Stevens [various]. Since I can't list 
            everything, please feel free to inquire about a specific topic if 
            you have particular interests that this paper could fulfill.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">N.B. This paper 
            can be written in any discursive style, rhetoric, and arrangement 
            of argument that you want, as long as it has good points, good close 
            readings, a thesis, a position on the long poem, an analysis of this 
            work in relation to positions on the long poem, and appropriate research 
            in both criticism and poetics commented on explicitly in your paper 
            (via summary and critique). Pick a topic, a discourse, and a length 
            in relation to your intellectual-aesthetic needs and desires. To develop/discuss 
            a topic, have a conference with me (required). To have more aid and 
            comfort along the way, submit a rough draft of the whole or a part 
            of the paper with a topics list fleshed out, making some comment on 
            all the above points (required for all MA students). Final papers 
            due 5 May. If you are working on Ashbery, it's due 8 May. During the 
            exam period (May 8-May 13), I will schedule individual final conferences 
            with you about your papers. If you need to write up a close reading 
            before you deliver it, or if you want to do a close reading of someone 
            already taken, you may. Please begin working on topics at the beginning 
            of the course; do not wait until your particular poet of interest 
            is discussed. You need to look ahead on the syllabus to get started.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Evaluation and 
            Grading: You will be graded on your final paper, your in-class reports 
            as oral presentations, your summaries in class and written, your general 
            participation. The final paper counts the most, but to quantify percentages 
            is not practical in graduate courses. In all graduate courses, along 
            with the final grade, instructors are required to write an evaluative 
            report on every student. This report goes in your file, which is kept 
            by the program in which you are matriculated. You will receive a copy 
            of these comments from me at the end of the semester, along with your 
            grade. You have access to this part of your file (but not to your 
            admissions packet with its confidential letters). If you are curious 
            what other instructors have said about you, or if you want to check 
            that all instructors have submitted these letters in a timely fashion 
            (sometimes not a bad idea), see Elaina Cooley, the Creative Writing 
            secretary, or Belinda-Wilson Hagins, Graduate Program. If you are 
            receiving financial aid, it behooves you to check whether all letters 
            have come in from the prior semester.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, in 
            all graduate courses, you have an opportunity to evaluate the instructor 
            on University-mandated forms that are distributed in class at the 
            end of the semester. (Your evaluations are not seen by the instructor 
            until after grades are filed; instructor gets typed copies only.) 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Necessary works 
            on reserve on long poems in general and issues of design. I will assign 
            specific topics in these and other readings. Responsibilities of every 
            student: to have read, as completely as is plausible, the text for 
            that week. In addition, to have read, when possible, the statements 
            BY the particular poet and critics that are on reserve. In the case 
            of books of letters--check in the index for the relevant materials. 
            If something is not available, focus on what you have in hand, and 
            don't get hyper. You can catch up at intervals in the semester.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On reserve means 
            at Paley Library, Main Desk. I have made photocopies of the materials 
            in a couple of course packs or put books on reserve. You are responsible 
            for acquiring these as you go along in the course.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Questions that 
            will continue to interest us, and may be taken as ground notes (though 
            not all can be taken up at any one time) are:<br>
            1) definitional and modal-genre types of long poems (sequence, serial, 
            epic, ode, life's work, etc.), how this &quot;type&quot; works with 
            theme and poetics in each specific case; other genre issues<br>
            2) a particular work's use of time and space<br>
            3) syntax, line use and page space (poetry as organized segmentivities); 
            diction, imagery, and their social meanings; &quot;part/whole relationships&quot; 
            <br>
            4) questions of beginning and of telos or ending or&quot; stopping&quot;; 
            attitudes toward &quot;accumulation&quot; and &quot;completeness&quot; 
            (Silliman's terms) <br>
            5) authorial subjectivity in its social locations (including gender, 
            class, race, religious culture, and others); what impact do these 
            have on the production and construction of the text; is authorial 
            subjectivity constructed in particular affiliative group formations?<br>
            6) reader's subjectivity in its social locations (including gender, 
            class, race, religious culture and others); what impact do these have 
            on the reception or consumption of the text? is reader subjectivity 
            constructed in particular affiliative group formations? <br>
            7) the history of composition, if relevant; biographical insights 
            brought to bear on the text; the question of &quot;entrance&quot; 
            or portal poems; the issue of &quot;recognition&quot; that one is 
            writing a long poem (and why); does poet's idea for the poem change 
            over time? <br>
            8) the poetics of the work as enunciated by the poet, as articulated 
            by authorial decision or by accident, and/or extrapolated by the reader<br>
            9) reading experience: &quot;the phenomenological experience of the 
            reader&quot; (Silliman); &quot;how to operate this book&quot; is another 
            approach to the same issue<br>
            10) the particulars of a text scrutinized by a close reading; the 
            &quot;textual surface&quot;; part/whole relationships<br>
            11) bibliographic and textual history of this work, where particularly 
            relevant; publishing history, textual history <br>
            12) nature of the cultural allusions or materials incorporated<br>
            13) the social or cultural work of this text; the assumptions it proposed, 
            the knowledge it claims to offer. </font></p>
