            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“Rachel Blau DuPlessis’ long poem “Drafts” forges a generic field somewhere between a series and a sequence, a mutually constitutive life-poem in drafts and an accumulation of autonomous though recursive episodes. The trajectory — toward coherence or liberated from its strictures — remains indefinite, precisely because this generic field is a construct of the “Drafts,” nothing at all taken for granted or based on received wisdom, though radical modernist long poems provide clear precedents, right to the project’s overall texture of allusion made familiar by, among others, Melvin Tolson’s Harlem Gallery, H.D.’s Trilogy, and especially Ezra Pound’s Cantos.”<strong> Patrick Durgin, [Review of Torques] Jacket 35 (2008).</strong></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="MsoNormal"><span style='color:black'><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;In Drafts, DuPlessis combines
narrative and lyric elements, crosses genres (documentary, report, ode, elegy,
autobiography, midrash), creates palimpsests, uses gloss, creolisation,
over-writing, multiple fonts, punning, and word-hinges, all of which contribute
to a sense of the text as being at once inclusive (polyvocal, multi-cultural,
and symphonic) as well as filled with gaps, hesitant, and conflicted.
Blacked-out patches of text in &ldquo;Draft 5: Gap,&rdquo; &ldquo;Draft 52: Midrash,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Draft
68: Threshold&rdquo; remind the reader of the overlay of social censorship that

            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;DuPlessis asks us to take seriously Olson's call for the
              poetry-page as a wide-open field on which historical, theoretical, social and
              aesthetic problematics unfurl, twist, evolve and mutate dialectically and/or
              dialogically, bouncing off each other in collision or play, interlocking in
              agonistic intensity or affectionate rapprochement.&nbsp; <b>Drafts</b> (the series and the present volume under
              review) is one manifestation of that Duncian meadow to which we are permitted
              to return as often as we can handle the immersion it compels. ...&nbsp; DuPlessis is after nothing less than a
  &quot;dolce stil nuovo&rdquo; for &quot;women's poetry&quot; &#8211;one that is
  &quot;outside gender&quot; but indebted to the insights of the women's movement
              in which she participated.&nbsp; A new
              form. New forms, unpredictable, that inch into being as the poems find their
              appropriate forms.&nbsp; &hellip; Adorno and his
              tortured dialectic, especially in the wake of the European Jewish genocide,
              also become interlocutors as the poet searches for rigorous but supple means of
              reckoning with history and the wayward intellect.&nbsp; Knots, quipus and other textile figures abound as models for
              poetry, for language and for thinking; so does terrain, textual or terrestrial,
              verdant or menacing, florally bucolic (&quot;Draft 40: One Lyric&quot;) or
              gutted by an imperial warfare (&quot;Draft 47: Printed Matter&quot;) in which
              the poet, as US citizen, is implicated.&rdquo; <b>Maria Damon. [Review of Drafts

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;More than a craft,  the poet&rsquo;s job of work for DuPlessis assumes the ethical demands of a  &lsquo;vocation.&rsquo; Such a calling, moreover, borders on the priestly, speaking as it  does here out of the &lsquo;ossuarial shadows&rsquo; that connote literally the crypt where  the bones of the dead are interred. Not unlike Wallace Stevens&rsquo;s poet as  &lsquo;metaphysician in the dark,&rsquo; DuPlessis&rsquo;s authorial personal is committed to  working conditions that demand a special form of attention to the <i>via  negativa</i> wherein is revealed &lsquo;[n]othing that is not there and the nothing  that is.&rsquo;&rdquo; ([citing Stevens] p. 87) <b>Walter Kalaidjian</b>, <b>The Edge of  Modernism: American Poetry and the Traumatic Past</b>.

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;Given the beauty and complexity  of these drafts, it&rsquo;s not much of an exaggeration to say that DuPlessis has  invented a new way of integrating poetic form and content. Hers is a massive,  cathedral-size project unlike any other in contemporary literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From what I can tell, DuPlessis doesn&rsquo;t  write poems so much as build them. The manner in which she does that is what  makes [her] one of the most exciting and inventive writers of our time.&rdquo; <b>Andrew  Ervin, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s truly poetry in motion,&rdquo;</b> <b>Philadelphia Inquirer</b> (August 21,  2005): H 12.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;DuPlessis has  created one of the most sustained and magnificent meditations written by a  contemporary poet on loss, presence, and the haunting persistence of language  to redeem what has vanished&nbsp; &hellip;. The  order of the world in <b>Drafts</b> may be predicated on loss, but it&rsquo;s a loss  that&rsquo;s redeemed by its being folded over into a capacious, labyrinthine process  of response that turns the never-ending occasion of depletion into a recurring  event of plenitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; &hellip; &lsquo;What is here&rsquo;  is both the full run of experience that the synaptic range of the poem is  capable of registering in a dazzling variety of pitches and timbres and its  ineluctable evaporation, which leaves in its wake fragments and debris for the  poet to take up as theme, ruminate over, turn to song. The scale of <b>Drafts</b> is monumental; its focus anti-monumental.&rdquo; <b>Patrick Pritchett, On Drafts.</b> <b>Jacket  22</b>: <a href="http://jacketmagazine.com/22/prit-dupless.html">http://jacketmagazine.com/22/prit-dupless.html</a>.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;True to their name [<b>Drafts</b>], the poems accent  provisionality, risk, the absence of guarantee, delving into words and word  parts with a heteroglossic verve that seems vengeance at times. With recourse  to an astonishing range of techniques and material devices, formal concern as  inclination and qualm, these poems register, lament, react to and wrestle with  erosions on multiple fronts&mdash;psychic, social, historical, somatic&hellip;. They affirm  and negate the toll history takes on letter and spirit, affirming and negating  and navigating a way between.&rdquo; <b>Nathaniel Mackey, Chancellors&rsquo; Reading List</b>, in <b>American </b>Poet (Spring 2003).</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;In sheer propulsive  force, in its capacity to engage the world while simultaneously keeping a close  eye on those (always treacherous) words through which we define our place among  the things of this world, in its polyphonic exploration of a full range of  experience from the personal through the historical to the religious, in its  sheer pleasure in the physicality of language, the poetry of Rachel Blau  DuPlessis seems to me as satisfying as the work of any poet writing today.&rdquo; (p.  157) <b>Burton Hatlen, &ldquo;Renewing the Open Engagement: H.D. and Rachel Blau  DuPlessis.&rdquo; H.D. and Poets After</b>.

  &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&ldquo;The draft form in  which DuPlessis has been writing for over a decade now is uniquely suited to  her poetic goals, as it incorporates into the flow of discourse the random  one-thing-after-anotherness of daily life, and the eruption into that life of  History, and the writer&rsquo;s experience of facing again the blank page and  strewing it with words, and, always, the moment by moment rediscovery of a  world that is insistently there, beyond our will and intentionality.&rdquo; (p. 151) <b>Burton Hatlen, &ldquo;Renewing the Open Engagement: H.D. and Rachel Blau DuPlessis.&rdquo; H.D. and Poets After.</b> Ed.

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;Rachel Blau  DuPlessis does what all good poets must do: She crosses, and indeed transcends,  boundaries. There&rsquo;s something of the &lsquo;language&rsquo; poet to her: She&rsquo;s obsessed  with syntax (her poems are &lsquo;about&rsquo; themselves as much as they are about any  exterior subject, and tend to comment on themselves as they proceed), and she  pays much attention to the sheer music of words as they butt up against each  other on the page. ... I&rsquo;ve cited contemporaries with whom DuPlessis&rsquo; work  seems sympathetic, but it&rsquo;s Pound and Zukofsky and Oppen I think of must when  reading her. DuPlessis&rsquo; images can be as sharp and clear as those in the best  work of Oppen, and she has the big-poem ambitions of the makers of Pound&rsquo;s <b>The  Cantos</b> and Zukofsky&rsquo;s long poem <b>A</b>. ... She has a masterful feel for  form--lines are launched successfully from uniform flush-left margins to roam  the page. And her ear can be astonishing: there&rsquo;s not a page in the book that  doesn&rsquo;t contain unexpected combinations of sound. Like Ives, she&rsquo;s fond of all  kinds of sound, and her tone, too, can leap from the colloquial to the  starchily academic in a matter of a few words. Her visual imagination is rich,  and her capacity for wordplay is considerable.&rdquo;(p. 9)&nbsp; <b>Robert Long &ldquo;A collection that defies today&rsquo;s boundaries of  poetry,&rdquo;</b> <b>Philadelphia Inquirer</b> (Sunday, May 11, 1997): 9</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;In the intense,  ruminating interrogation of a &lsquo;random strewing of debris,&rsquo; Rachel Blau  DuPlessis inscribes the working of her <b>Drafts</b>--a collection of polyvocal  texts which seeks to explore through the multiple displaying of poetical styles  and typographies, through the &lsquo;line marks names&rsquo; of her writing, the cumulative  slippages of sense as they threaten the very plausibility of a closed self....  DuPlessis is haunted by the precarious closures, &lsquo;hinge-loss door, lack latch&rsquo;,  that have come to undermine the idea of presence. ... Writing the undone across  what she calls &lsquo;the historical dead&rsquo;, Rachel Blau DuPlessis thus manages to  inscribe the finest of equilibriums between a burning loss of identity, its  increasing impossibility and the urge to avoid purifying whatever else is being  shaped to take its place&rdquo; (pp. 90, 93) <b>Caroline Bergvall, in Parataxis 6 </b>(Spring-Summer 1994): 90-93.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;...I think DuPlessis&rsquo;s poem--the draft, the fold, and the  whole of the unfolding series--places considerable hope in its own voracious  and eccentric methods. DuPlessis&rsquo;s <b>Drafts</b>, and Dahlen&rsquo;s <b>A Reading</b> as well, suggest that interminable &lsquo;pattern-breaking&rsquo; experiments like theirs  may succeed in exploding inherited restrictions / inscriptions of gender. They  do so by resisting the deliberately beautiful, by devouring dense sediment of  intellectual and material detritus, by approaching all experiential and  cultural materials as matter for incorporation and serious intellectual  analysis. In the process, they may expose alternative forms of enlightenment  and empowerment, and even alternative models of beauty....&rdquo; (p. 301) <b>Lynn  Keller</b>, <b>Forms of Expansion: Recent Women&rsquo;s Long Poems</b>.

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;Rachel Blau  DuPlessis&rsquo;s <b>Drafts 3-14</b> is maximal poetry. Her rich and manifold range  of reference and expression--emotional, intellectual, and observational--is  illuminated through a dazzling array of techniques. These poems never let us  settle down and never let us down. Strong feeling, complex thought, precise  observation, a superb technique--what more do we need?&rdquo; (back cover comment) <b>Jackson MacLow</b>, comment on <b>Drafts (3-14).</b></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;...DuPlessis&rsquo;s  longer works open up onto &lsquo;folding,&rsquo; a multiplicity of thought, voice, and  rhetoric that is less possible within a lyric of attention. As I shall also be  claiming, the residue of that lyric-apprenticeship enhances the longer poems,  giving them pith and beauty, a tension that calls for attention. Thus her  longer poems, by virtue of their proximity to a lyrical desire, have a dialectical  force, their openness and multiplicity existing proximate to an impulse to  narrow and to pare.&rdquo; (p. 40) <b>Hank Lazer</b>, <b>Opposing Poetries, Volume II:  Readings</b>. Northwestern University Press, 1996.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&ldquo;Rachel Blau  DuPlessis&rsquo; <b>Drafts 15-XXX, The Fold</b> situates itself within this paradox  of covering and recovering, folding back on earlier drafts as acts of  &lsquo;correspondence.&rsquo; Like the notes that correspond to each draft, the earlier  writing becomes a scene of reading: not as telos, not to occupy an ideal position  of reader-writer, here-there, then-now, but reading the earlier drafts as  &lsquo;conspicuous oracles,&rsquo; fragments &lsquo;pressed down&nbsp;&nbsp; unfinished&nbsp;&nbsp; overwritten&nbsp;&nbsp; refolded&rsquo; (28). Thus, each poem acts as a  kind of event horizon in which both language and &lsquo;event&rsquo; fold and disperse,  fuse and scatter....&rdquo; (p. 166) <b>Dan Featherston, &ldquo;Review [of Waldman, DuPlessis, Riding],&rdquo; Sulfur 41</b> (Fall 1997): 164-169. </font></p>
