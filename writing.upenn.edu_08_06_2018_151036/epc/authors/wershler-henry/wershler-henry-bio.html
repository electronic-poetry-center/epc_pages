      <P>Born in Winnipeg, Darren Wershler-Henry lives and works as a writer 
      and<BR>critic in Toronto. His first book of concrete and visual 
      poetry,<BR>NICHOLODEON: a book of lowerglyphs, was the first book printed 
      by the new Coach House Books<BR>in 1997, and is now in its second edition. 
      NICHOLODEONLINE, the e-book version<BR>of NICHOLODEON, is located at the 
      following URL:<BR><BR><A 

href="http://www.popped.com/hyperglyph/">http://www.popped.com/hyperglyph/</A><BR><BR>His 
      second book of poetry, the tapeworm foundry andor the dangerous 
      prevalence<BR>of imagination, a strange loop of poetic propositions and 
      recipes for<BR>conceptual art, was published by the House of Anansi Press 
      in 2000. <BR><BR>Wershler-Henry has been an active member of the small 
      press since 1989,<BR>editing and contributing to zines such as n-1, 
      SinOverTan, Virus 23, and<BR>TORQUE, a bimonthly magazine of concrete and 
      experimental poetry. His essays<BR>on theory and pop culture have appeared 
      in books and periodicals including<BR>Contemporary Verse 2, Gone to 
      Croatan: Origins of American Dropout Culture, <BR>Grain, Open Letter, 
      Postmodern Apocalypse: Theory and Culture at the End, <BR>Prairie Fire, 
      Quarry, Quill &amp; Quire, Rampike, Semiotext(e) Canada(s), <BR>Sulfur, 
      and West Coast Line. <BR><BR>An active contributor to online culture since 
      1990, when he bought his first<BR>modem, Wershler-Henry co-authored the 
      infamous Virus 23 Meme with Christian<BR>B&#58515;, and posted it on Andy Hawks' 
      FutureCulture mailing list in 1993. <BR>Douglas Rushkoff's book Media 
      Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture (Ballantine<BR>Books: 1994), 
      takes its structure from and bases much of its argument on<BR>this 
      incident; Rushkoff writes that the philosophy behind the Virus 23 
      Meme<BR>presents "the most subversive opinions that a person can hold 
      [today]." <BR>Wershler-Henry is currently writing his doctoral 
      dissertation at York<BR>University on the relationship between the 
      typewriter and the poetics of<BR>dictation in postmodern poetry.
