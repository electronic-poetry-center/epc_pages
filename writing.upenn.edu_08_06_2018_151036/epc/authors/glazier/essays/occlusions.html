 Poetry has entered the electronic landscape. Even if such a landscape
suggests images of electronic video games or machine-readable
iambics swooning under the influence of a science fiction lexicon,
the fact is that the electronic world is a world predominantly
of writing. Though this writing often seems eclipsed by its mode
of transmission (electronic mail and the World Wide Web as primary
instances), in this it is not unlike all previous writing, which
has also been eclipsed by modes of transmission. (For example,
the <A HREF="occlusions.html#book">book</A>, 
the stone tablet, the scroll.) Electronic writing, like
previous instances of writing, equally engages the double "mission"
of writing: to varying degrees, writing is about a subject, but
also about the medium through which it is transmitted. "Transmission,"
then, suggests both the circulation of texts and the cross-purpose
("trans" = across or to cross + "mission" = purpose or intention)
of inscription.
<P>
 How does transcription have a cross-purpose? The language you
are breathing becomes the language you think. Take for example
in UNIX (and the whole World Wide Web is UNIX-based) to "grep"
or "chmod," things done daily, even hundreds of times a day. When
you grep ("global/regular expression/print") a given target, you
search across files for instances of a string of characters, or
for a word. Chmod ("change mode") uses a numeric code to grant,
in an augenblick, permission to read, write, and/or execute a
given file to yourself, your community, and your world. How could
it be simpler? Why don't we all think in UNIX? If we do, these
ideas are a file, I am chmoding this file for all of you to have
read, write, and execute permission--and for God's sake, please
grep what you need from this! What I am saying is that poetry
itself is best suited to grep how technology factors language
and how this technology, writing, and production, are as inseparable
as Larry, Moe, and Curly Java.
<P>
 The rise of the little magazine and small presses from hand presses
of the Fifties through the mimeo, xerox, and offset production
of the following decades have exemplified not only poetry's engagement
with its mode of production, but also its means of dissemination.
What has existed is a union between poetry and its technologies
of dissemination. Poetry's paths through these technologies has
been one of appropriating discarded technologies or subverting
primary economic intentions of technologies (publishing with tossed
mimeo machines or running off a poetry magazine on the photocopier
at work). Paper-based dissemination, however, also has its limitations.
Paper is expensive. Distribution, because of postage costs and
import restrictions, is effectively limited by national boundaries.
(Why does it cost more, for example, to mail a postcard from Buffalo
to Toronto than it does to mail one to Anchorage?) The Nineties
have presented even greater challenges with the demise of poetry
distribution channels such as Segue, Inland, and others, and the
rise of bookstore chains with their exclusive attention to gross
sales. This problem has been increasingly compounded by the practically
nonexistent means of distribution for poetry in other media, audio,
video, and graphical, most notably.
<P>
 The continued importance of print poetry notwithstanding, the
possibilities for poetry's writing in electronic space are to
be reckoned with. What will happen? Will it be milk and honey
or a virtual Balkans? Electronic technology offers unprecedented
opportunities for the production, archiving, distribution, and
promotion of poetic texts but most importantly, electronic space
is a space of writing. What I would argue for is an approach that
looks at the <I>writing</I> on the screen. Further, just as the
mimeo brought its "style" of writing or the perfect-bound offset
book its typical page size and length of text--factors which influenced
the <I>writing</I> of texts <I>for</I> these technologies--the
World Wide Web factors its texts.
<P>
 On the Web, the actual language (HTML) and scripts which enable
the circulation of texts <I>are</I> writing and the way texts
are displayed is an <I>activity</I> of writing; that is, on the
Web we write on. This site enters writing not only as 
<A HREF="occlusions.html#technique">technique</A>
but as "<A HREF="occlusions.html#transmission">transmission</A>". 
This fusion is unavoidable. Charles Bernstein
has commented that "language is the material of both thinking
and writing. We think and write in language, which sets up an
intrinsic connection between the two." 
("Thought's" <A HREF="occlusions.html#thoughts">62</A>) This same
kinship applies to writing and the computer. (Interesting, in
this regard, in the last century "computer" meant a person hired
to perform computations. Later, this meaning was superseded by
our present sense of a machine that "substitutes mechanical performance
for an intellectual process.")
<P>
 Postmodern poetic theory is particularly relevant to electronic
space. Robert Duncan, writing about Charles Olson suggests that
one of Olson's messages was adjusting the scale of the poem's
activity. This has particular relevance to an electronic poetics,
where assumptions about specific formal qualities must be converted
from assumptions about the print medium. The breakthrough? As
with any development in technology, writing does not stay the
same but the writing technology becomes an expanded way to see
under the aegis of the writing activity. This scale, Olson suggested,
extended:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"from Folsom cave to now"--the waves of pre-glacial and post-glacial
migrations out of Asia, the adventuring voyages out from the Phoenician
world, the Norse world, and then the Renaissance, as coming "home,"
"back" to their origins. "SPACE": "I spell it large because it
comes large here," he wrote: "Large, and without mercy" (Duncan
"Introduction" <A HREF="occlusions.html#duncan">80</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Despite the aggressive stance and gendered diction, Olson's historicizing
of poetic space suggests a movement into larger scenes of activity.
This movement can also be seen as extending into electronic space.
The sense of "home" here resonant with a home page which is fragile,
fleeting, "historic," a point of application juxtaposed against
the merciless immensity of online space. With Olson's work, Duncan
writes, "the opening up of great spaces in consciousness had begun,
and in the very beginning, it its origins, he moves in, as he
knows he must, to redirect the ideas of language and of the body,
of Man, of commune, and of history" 
("Introduction" <A HREF="occlusions.html#duncan">80</A>).
 This
"consciousness" includes a consciousness of the space of the page
and writers of Olson's circle, Duncan and Robert Creeley among
them, addressed the physical space of the page as a material element
of the poem.
<P>
 The question then becomes how, on the Net, writing intersects
with its materials. What specifically is the difference between
a paper poetry and an electronic one? The paper press certainly
offers parallels. The avatar of small circulation, fine press,
has clearly been concerned with its materials. Those who work
in fine printing can speak of sensuous relations between text
and materials. (The "press" in fine press insists on "impression";
the act of physical impression carries through to tactile qualities
in the printed object.) Thus fine press also engages transmission;
what is transmitted is the tactile record of the act of impression.
The term "small press," in distinction to fine press, clearly
insists on transmission. (In this context it's a little perverse
to consider the mimeo, the flagship of early small press, sensuous.)
"Press," here, refers to the machinery of reproduction and the
social institution of disseminating information. It is small,
non-corporate, a peque&ntilde;ismo, privileging content over profit.
Its machinery becomes a part of the materiality of the text, grepping
writing through such called for material facts as 8-1/2 X 11 paper,
black and white appearance, and (before the microcomputer revolution)
a fairly standardized set of fonts. The materials of the technology
have a direct effect on the actual path of writing. In the electronic
environment, the materials shift. As fonts rage wistful or out
of control and the "size" of paper irrelevant, texts become constituted
as physical <I>pieces</I> of a never complete and constantly reconstituting
whole (the Network).
<P>
 Ron Silliman introduced his influential anthology of new writing,
<I>In the American Tree</I>, stating that "Projective Verse is
'Pieces' On" ("Language" <A HREF="occlusions.html#language">xv</A>). 
Silliman was suggesting that <I>In
the American Tree</I> extended Olson's theory of Projective Verse
as realized in Creeley's breakthrough collection of poems <I>Pieces</I>.
(<I>Pieces </I>also insisted on poetry's possibilities, as pieces
of text, outside externally mandated form.) This statement has
resonance in new terrain: <I>electronic verse is pieces online</I>.
Thinking of Creeley's "form is never more than an extension of
<A HREF="occlusions.html#form-content">content</A>" 
(<I>Complete</I> 
<A HREF="occlusions.html#correspondence">79</A>), what avenues of content have been
opened by such vastly different avenues of "form"? The medium
as technique/the poem as "making," hence electronic poetries are
positioned to enter and extend a number of investigations of language
into a new poetic terrain where words are mutable and conscious
of transmission. These are words which do not merely name; they
approach an added potential for "activity." As Charles Bernstein
has written, speaking of visual poetry:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For words are no more labels of things than the sky is a styrofoam
wrap of some Divine carryout shop. And letters are no more tied
to words or words to sentences than a mule is tied to its burden.
<P>
 Letters in liberty. words freed from the tyranny of horizontality,
or sequence.... (Response <A HREF="occlusions.html#response">3</A>)<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

These words have equal significance in the electronic realm. Bernstein's
allusion here to Marinetti's great Futurist declaration gestures
towards the advancement of writing's physicality. Electronic texts
provide the subsequent step here, moving writing into charged
space, where words themselves begin to reach beyond sequentiality.
From context to "dystext": pieces or fragments of text. This is
a dance outside the linear, outside the line. An interesting place
for writing &#133; as they say in Texas, "real cowboys don't line
dance."
<P>
  Thus we find online hypertext. (Generic and intersystemic in
qualities; as opposed to proprietary "closed" hypertext systems.)
Importantly, electronic poetics are not tied to the linearity
of the page; this is not an end of linearity but an emergence
of multiple linearities. The connection between these multiples
is the <I>link</I>. A signal word or conjunction of letters, the
mule unharnassed, free to jump into a lateral or completely irreverent
context--or medium (visual, sound, video).
<P>
 Links bring to the text the riddle of discovery experienced by
the anthropologist stepping onto the soil of a previously undiscovered
culture: once the imprint of such a footstep is on the sand, the
culture is no longer "native." Once a link has been taken, it
is no longer a link but a constituted part of the already traveled
narrative; the link loses its potentiality but, in doing so, opens
up the possibility of other links. And what if some of these links
fail? What we have is not a failure of the internal system but
a triumph of internal workings over any possibility of external
order. As Gregory Ulmer puts it:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is no "central processor" in hyperrhetoric, no set of rules,
but a distributed memory, a memory triggered by a cue that spreads
through the encyclopedia, the library, the data base (connectionism
suggests that the hardware itself should be designed to support
the spread of memory through an associational network) 
(<A HREF="occlusions.html#ulmer">346</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Hypertext allows sequences throughout sequences. However, a serious
point of difference must be taken with some Web utopianists: despite
tendencies in this direction, the point is not that <I>everything</I>
is linked through these sequences. The constitution of any such
whole could only be a misrepresentation of stability, the futile
pursuit of yet another encyclopedia. The insistences of the internal
orders of texts do not add stability to the text, rather they
add a perplexing layer of instability; it is the "failure" of
the links, whether they connect or not, that gives them their
activity and it is through this activity that electronic writing
departs irreversibly from the world of print.
<P>
 This post-typographic and non-linear disunion is no news to poetics.
The argument that "Pound's significance lies in his having anticipated
the end of 'the Gutenberg era', the age of print" (Davie <A HREF="occlusions.html#davie">5</A>), Futurism,
Stein, Dada, and following World War II, the exploration of system
in Olson, Duncan and Blaser's serial works, Eigner's articulation,
Creeley's numeric determinations, Spicer and Roberson's split
pages, Bernstein, McCaffery, Silliman, Grenier, Fisher, Sheppard,
Hocquard, Royet-Journoud, the radical typographies of Howe and
Drucker, Antin's improvizations, the translations of Joris, Rothenberg's
ethnopoetics, redeployments of language by O'Sullivan, Bergvall,
MacCormack, Brossard, Leggott, Hejinian, Retallack, and Weiner,
and the alleatories of Mac Low and Cage point in different ways
to various forms of nonlinearity.
<P>
 It is the play of <I>pieces</I> that forms 
the tropes of the
electronic web. Speaking of Charles Bernstein's work, Marjorie
Perloff writes that it "playfully exploits such rhetorical figures
as pun, anaphora, epiphora, metathesis, epigram, anagram, and
neologism to create a seamless web of reconstituted words" (<A HREF="occlusions.html#perloff">231</A>).
Bernstein has called this weaving "dysraphism". "'Raph' &#133;
means 'seam,'" Bernstein explains, "so for me dysraphism is mis-seaming
-- a prosodic device!" ("Dysraphism" <A HREF="occlusions.html#dysraphism">44</A>") Bernstein's "sensitivity
to etymologies and latent meanings is reflected in the poem itself,"
Perloff writes, "which is an elaborate 'dysfunctional fusion of
embryonic parts' [and] a 'disturbance of stress, pitch, and rhythm
of speech' in the interest of a new kind of urban <I>rhapsody</I>"
(<A HREF="occlusions.html#perloff">230</a>). The weaving of disparate elements into a larger "whole,"
is a prosody. As Ron Silliman writes, "When words are, meaning
soon follows. Where words join, writing is" ("For L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E" <A HREF="occlusions.html#for">16</A>).
It is through this dysraphism that writing approaches its potential
on the Web, a writing based on links.
<P>


 What are links but faults in the monolinear imagination? In his
"Parapraxes" essays Freud has written about parapraxis, faults
in reading, writing, and speaking, "slips of the tongue," as more
possible when the mind shifts into an associative disposition.
(For example, at a recent videodisk viewing of cave paintings
of Lascaux, I was struck by an enlarged detail as identical to
a common image of open-heart surgery.) Though Freud would, in
his fashion, like to suggest that conclusions may be drawn from
parapraxis, the ability to read linked writings depends not on
conclusion but <I>occlusion</I>, or an aberration of the eye,
literally and homophonously. (If the machine is meant to calculate,
writing begins when its error is engaged.) This is a space where
the minor matters: monolinearity blocked, peripheral vision may
again resume activity.
<P>
  An electronic poetics alters the "eye" and also extends the
physicality of reading. With the keyboard, literal manipulation
is engaged with fingers determining different referentialities
of the text; a sight more active than repetitious page turning.
Again a fusion of parts extending into a plethora of directions.
Robert Duncan's reference to the traditional work of a poet as
juggling a number of objects. Gertrude Stein's "a spectacle and
nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system
to pointing" (<I>Tender</I> <A HREF="occlusions.html#stein">9</A>).
<P>
 Writing's acute (hence "hyper") activity of movement and transmission,
Bernstein's Poetics list, <I>RIF/T</I>'s thousand subscribers,
or the 25,000 transactions a month at the Electronic Poetry Center
(http://writing.upenn.edu/epc) witness the merging of writing
and transmission. When oral, the voice projects across the room,
beyond rooms. As a "system to pointing" its poetic is one of deflection.
Texts move not only within themselves but into socially-charged
externalities: a webbed interference of junk mail, "frets" of
information, systemic failures, ephemera, disunion. There is no
resting place--only the incessantly reconstituted links dissolving
each time the reading is entered.
<P>
 As to the "resting place" in question, I am frequently asked
what factor was so motivating to cause a poet to enter the world
of greps, chmods, kernels, and shells--not to mention to suffer
the ignominy of being referred to as "one of the UNIX persons"
and create the Electronic Poetry Center. The reason? Not only
could we not get our early online texts correctly archived, we
couldn't convince the archival site to even classify the texts
as poetry. The administrators there insisted that the work we
created didn't look like poetry to them and so our work was listed
under "Zines". What more reason could there be needed for founding
an online site?
<P>
 An electronic poetics is a poetics. Like any other poetics which
recognizes system--be it breath, a controversy of texts, or a
nexus of interests--system is a determining factor. A poetics
also involves a particular engagement, or set of engagements,
with its issuing "authority" and technology. The public life of
a poetics has, perhaps, been nowhere more visible, with its incessant
transmission, than in the electronic poetries. An electronic poetry
is a public word, projected across a public world, across systems,
itself as system.
