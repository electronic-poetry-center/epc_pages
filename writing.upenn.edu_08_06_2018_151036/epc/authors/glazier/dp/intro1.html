        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000"><i>Digital 
          Poetics</i> is an introduction to the making of the new digital poetries. 
          From code to code, whether a Web page in Moscow, a speaking clock in 
          Kentish Town, a computer-generated Buffalo, or a bot hiding in an archive 
          in Melbourne, the making of poetry has established itself on a matrix 
          of new shores. From hypertext through visual/kinetic text to writing 
          in networked and programmable media, there is a tangible feel of arrival 
          in the spelled air. New possibilities stand out as intriguing while 
          technologies that once seemed futuristic now have all the timeliness 
          of World War II bunkers overlooking an unperturbed Pacific. But arrival 
          where? It is argued here that this is not arrival at a place, but at 
          an awareness of the conditions of texts. Such an arrival includes recognizing 
          that the conditions that have characterized the making of innovative 
          poetry in the twentieth century have a powerful relevance to such works 
          in twenty-first century media. That is, poets are making with the same 
          attention that they did through the movements of the previous century 
          and they are doing so with new materials &#151; and new materials alter 
          what constitutes writing. Through recognizing the conditions of such 
          making and by appreciating the material qualities of new computer media 
          we can begin to identify the new poetries of the twenty-first century. 
          Putting such a vision together is more than a simple concatenation of 
          strings of practice; it involves recognizing the interwoven matrices 
          through which e-writing makes its way. In this model, writing is not 
          a single monumental totality that can be measured. Rather, what can 
          be charted is writing as an overlapping, hybrid, and extendible terrain 
          of <i>parts</i> of writing, parts that fit together at times awkwardly 
          and out of joint, to compose a textual continuum through which writing 
          practices weave.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">Indeed, 
          charting the production and circulation of poetry is germane to any 
          study of poetry since poetry's circulation has always been related to 
          its making. The same was true of poetry in the past century, when its 
          means of production and distribution was a crucial consideration of 
          writing. The rise of little magazines and the small press from hand 
          presses of the Fifties through the mimeo, Xerox, and offset production 
          of the following decades demonstrated not only poetry's<a
href="intro1.html#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> [i] </a> engagement with its mode of production 
          but its dependence upon its means of dissemination. It is important 
          to note that, in the twentieth century, such previous engagements involved 
          &quot;discarded&quot; technologies. As such the production and consequent 
          distribution of poetry texts lagged behind publishing and distribution 
          channels more current with production technologies<a href="intro1.html#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> 
          [ii] </a>. Distribution was also effectively limited by national boundaries, 
          with the concomitant problems of postage costs, duty, and currency exchange. 
          The nineties presented even greater challenges with the collapse of 
          poetry distribution channels (Segue, Inland, and others) and the nearly 
          totalizing rise of bookstore chains. The decade finished with an even 
          more debilitating blow delivered by online book merchandising companies, 
          companies bound neither to serve any community nor even to make a profit.<a
href="intro1.html#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [iii] </a> Poetry's distribution problem 
          was further compounded by the practically nonexistent means of distribution 
          for poetry in other media such as sound, performance, and the visual.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">The 
          continued importance of print notwithstanding, poetry has a current 
          engagement with electronic technology<a href="intro1.html#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> 
          [iv] </a>. The electronic medium offers unprecedented opportunities 
          for the production, archiving, and distribution of poetry texts, all 
          possible with present technology. Several computer poetry production 
          efforts were made from 1980-1990<a href="intro1.html#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> 
          [v] </a> yet during that decade poetry's victories in the electronic 
          realm remained scattered and the texts themselves often proved elusive. 
          (Divergent programs were required for operation.  Further, some of the 
          publishers involved were arguing the proprietary status of their texts 
          and fighting distribution battles tougher than those of the small press.) 
          The nineties also compounded the difficulty of access to specific electronic 
          texts with the rise of the Internet and the Web. Though this might seem 
          a contradiction, the sudden proliferation of electronic texts of all 
          varieties has made access to specific types of writing even more challenging. 
          What have become crucial in the climate of this textual dystopia are 
          (1) gathering places or subject villages for texts with related engagements, 
          and (2) a recognition of the materiality of digital poetry texts.</font></p>
        <h4 align=center style='text-align:center'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">Sites</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">Central 
          to the success of electronic poetry is the notion of a &quot;subject 
          village,&quot; a site for the access, collection, and dissemination 
          of poetry and related writing. Such a site provides a gathering ground, 
          flood plain, mortar for the pestle of poesis. It should be understood 
          that such a subject village neither attempts to collect everything nor 
          does it exert &quot;control&quot; in a traditional sense. Rather:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000"> 
            It collects materials according to an editorial policy. Its contribution 
            to the Web lies in its provision of an focused collection of texts.<br>

            </font></li>
          <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000"> 
            It facilitates the dissemination of print publications (resulting 
            ultimately in royalties for authors) through the maintenance of bibliographic 
            and promotional vehicles. It also makes possible other types of publications 
            that may have been less than profitable in the print medium.<br>
            <br>
            </font></li>
          <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">

            resources.<br>

          <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000"> 
            The circulation of texts becomes its primary mission.<br>

            It exists in the context of the Web. That is, it not only delivers 
            texts but also offers slow connect times, error messages, misgivings, 
            and the megabytes of misinformation that typify a largely unedited 
            textual space.<br>

            </font></li>
          <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000"> 
            Most importantly, the creation of a poetry archive of this order rests 
            on the realization that the Web is itself an instance of writing. 
            </font></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 align=center style='text-align:center'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">Materials</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">Much 
          as with earlier technologies, the electronic medium is not only a publishing 
          and distribution means, but as a technology, enters the material of 
          writing. What writing is becomes altered by how it is physically written 
          through its production technology, its files, codes and URLs (sometimes 
          called &quot;earls&quot;). We are living in a material world and these 
          are material URLs<a href="intro1.html#_edn6"
name="_ednref6" title=""> [vi] </a>. The same material influences occurred in 
          the media of clay tablets, papyrus, and the codex, and it is no different 
          now. A parallel for such an engagement with the material in the twentieth 
          century? Think, for example of film -- not when it attempts to reproduce 
          reality but when it functions as a medium conscious of being constituted 
          of pans, camera angles, lens effects, and montage; i.e., there are certain 
          limits and specific effects concomitant with the materials of a given 
          medium. Further, the medium affects the materiality of the work. An 
          example of this is the way distortion, once a by-product of electric 
          instrumentation in rock music, has now become an aesthetic element in 
          the music. (The rock group Orgy's use of distortion in their 1998 hit 
          song &quot;Blue Monday&quot; is a prime example of this.) As a writing 
          medium, online electronic space depends on the fact that the Web is 
          itself an instance of writing. Not only do web pages contain writing 
          but these pages are presented through the medium of the home page and 
          are themselves written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)<a href="intro1.html#_edn7"
name="_ednref7" title=""> [vii] </a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">In 
          <i>Digital Poetics</i>, I look at such writing. Picture yourself with 
          two windows open: in one you are editing pure ASCII text using the glistening, 
          black Model T Ford of EMACS and sputtering through the black &amp; white 
          fields of VT100. In the other window you have Netscape open, that graphical 
          but heinously sloppy browser that seems out to get you with its delays, 
          bull-headed error messages, and proclamations that it just found you 
          750,000 items that match -- exactly -- your search for the term &quot;phanopoiea&quot;. 
          You are editing not on some back-up up system then uploading but on 
          the server itself, every time you save your work in progress -- improvements, 
          tests, errors -- it is immediately available to the world. The process 
          has all the risks of live television but there is an added excitement 
          since it is the act of writing that is the performance. In this investigation 
          we will write, read, and breathe within the UNIX C-shell environment. 
          A C-shell so efficient you swear you can hear the ocean if you put your 
          ear to the monitor. This is a dynamic, expansive writing space, a pixelated 
          meadow on a revolving disk inside a UNIX box. It is a field for which 
          permission is an actual fact of the UNIX environment, in Robert Duncan's 
          words (with the meadow representing creative space for Duncan):</font></p>

          Our task is to explore the texture of the clods the plow leaves behind; 
          to celebrate its nitrogen, iron, and mulch, to furrow the &quot;everlasting 
          omen of what is&quot; (7).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000"><i>Digital 
          Poetics</i> attempts to take on a task different than its peers. First, 
          this is a book about Web-based electronic writing viewed through the 
          lens of poetic practice. It is not another book about &quot;la vie en 
          prose&quot;. Second, rather than idealize, hyperbolize, speak in the 
          abstract, propose egolessness, waltz around conjectured possibilities, 
          deny intention, postulate, berate, or generally irritate, the goal here 
          is to argue electronic space as a <i>space of poesis</i>; to employ 
          the tropes, hypertextualities, linkages, and static of the medium; to 
          speak from the perspective of one up to the elbows in the ink of this 
          writing machine. (Though in this metaphor, the ink in question would 
          be less like that of the printing press and more like the obfuscating 
          fluid of the squid.) It is also important to acknowledge that electronic 
          writing has crossed the threshold into our common conversation. (Indeed, 
          our collective vocabulary is steadily growing: by some estimates, 25% 
          of the new words entering the English language each year are now related 
          to computing.) I hope to suggest that one may go beyond looking at technology 
          as something that should be on a shelf, labeled, and out of reach; there 
          is much to be gained by simply investigating it <i>as writing</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#8B0000">Indeed, 
          the digital field is a real form of practice and immediately relevant 
          to any informed sense of what we will call &quot;poetry&quot; in coming 
          years. But one must learn to see through a new lens, one with expanded 
          focal points. Trying to understand the digital work solely through codex 
          practice is like trying to understand film, for the person that has 
          never seen one, by looking at a still. It is this general lack of understanding 
          of the electronic text file as a physical, visual, and verbal writing 
          <i>material</i> (akin to a Pollack-painted, barn-sized wall of dizzying 
          links, splotches of error, and black holes of hang time) that is addressed 
          here. This study presents not a theory of electronic textual artifice, 
          not emotion as represented by the emoticon (;&gt;), but an investigation 
          into the materiality of electronic writing. It addresses, to varying 
          depths, the three principal forms of electronic textuality, hypertext, 
          visual/kinetic text, and works in programmable media. (Though by the 
          end of this study the goal is to emerge with a clear sense of the relative 
          importance of these three forms.) It does not try to determine what 
          might occur under ideal conditions. Rather, it looks at electronic textuality 
          as writing <i>per se</i> and investigates how the materiality of electronic 
          writing has changed the idea of writing itself, how this writing functions 
          in the real world of the Web, and what writing becomes when activated 
          in the electronic medium. There is a sense of “active” being argued 
          here similar to what William Carlos Williams argued for the print poem. 
          As Robert Creeley mentioned at a reading in Buffalo (November 5, 1999), 
          Williams's insistence was not on the poem as afterthought (the classic 
          concept of &quot;recollections collected in tranquility&quot;) but on 
          the poem as itself an instrument of thought. He has written:</font></p>

                  never forgotten Williams' contention that &quot;the poet thinks 
                  with his poem, in that lies his thought, and that in itself 
                  is the profundity ...&quot; Poems have always had this nature 
                  of revelation for me, becoming apparently objective manifestations 
                  of feelings and thoughts otherwise inaccessible. (<i>Collected

          poet thinks through the poem. Similarly, investigated here is not the 
          idea of the digital work as an extension of the printed poem, but the 
          idea of the digital poem as the process of thinking through this new 
          medium, thinking through <i>making</i>. As the poet works, the work 
          discovers.</font></p>

            is used in this volume to refer to practices of innovative poetry 
            rather than to what might be called academic, formal, or traditional 
            forms of poetry.</font></p>

            mimeo machines, early photocopy machines, and daisy-wheel printers 
            passed from businesses to small presses as they were superceded by 
            newer technologies.</font></p>

href="intro1.html#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title=""> [iii] </a> In this light it is surprising 
            that some poets choose to list an online book merchandiser as a source 
            for their books when they could as easily list a small press book 
            store. (These often also offer ordering through e-mail, the phone, 
            and the Web.) Since online book merchandisers have not committed to 
            ongoing support of small circulation books, it might be naive for 
            poets to support them without questioning the impact of this practice.</font></p>

            for digital poetry. It will sometimes be referred to in this volume 
            as digital poetry, electronic poetry, e-poetry, or computer-generated 
            writing. See the section &quot;Future Tenses&quot; in <i>Digital Poetics</i> 
            for a fuller discussion of the terms and boundaries of electronic

            you type in those symbols, fragments of names, tildes, and gutteral 
            utterances that invoke Web screens? For example, how is your experience 
            different approaching a writing at a URL containing the path &quot;/authors/glazier/theories/hypertext.html&quot;
