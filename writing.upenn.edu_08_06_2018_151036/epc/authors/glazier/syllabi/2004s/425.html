      <p>Visual Poetics provides an opportunity to explore the expressive potential 
        of language as a creative material consisting of alphabetic, visual, and 
        aural levels, with a focus on forms of visual expression, including Concrete 
        Poetry. Non-semantic forms of expression will be studied as keys to unlocking 
        this potential. The immense value of 20th century experimental literature 
        to he student's own efforts to design or interpret media writing is a 
        major concern of this course. We will be thinking about the multiple possibilities 
        of language as a conjunction of possibilities, textures, tones, meanings, 
        and media. We will look at digital literature as a merging of form, image, 
        language, and sound, and we will explore works that successfully produce 
        this extraordinary effect. We will look at works of Concrete Poetry and 
        consider these as models for digital media design. We will study theoretical 
        essays and manifestos related to visual media practice, investigating 
        modes and means of visual media expression. Course will require weekly 
        readings, an oral presentation, a final project, and quizzes or exams 
        as necessary.</p>
