        DIGITAL POETICS <br>

      <p>The seminar will look at the emerging field of digital literature and 
        the essays and texts central to the medium. This class offers the opportunity 
        to map a constellation of crucial texts: media such as sound, video, listserv 
        spaces, scholarly hypertext, etc. can be investigated, depending on interest. 
        We'll attempt to define what it is, what's happening, what's interesting 
        in the medium. We'll do this by looking at established authors, sites, 
        and projects. Crucial, however, will be suggestions you bring from your 
        research; these will extend and frame our discussion. The particular focus 
        of this seminar will be on a consideration of digital poetry as a field 
        of practice, including visual/kinetic text, interactive works, and works 
        in programmable media. We will therefore look at diverse fields of practice 
        within the genre, with attention to specific artists such as Alan Sondheim, 
        Jean-Pierre Balpe, J&ouml;rg Piringer, and others. Visits to class by 
        featured artists will occur, when possible. No special computer skills 
        are required. The seminar will require a final project, whether paper 
        or digital, a brief presentation, and weekly participation.</p>
