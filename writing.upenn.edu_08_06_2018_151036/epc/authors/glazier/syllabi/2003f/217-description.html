<P>Experimental poetry, sound poetry, and digital media poetry share
certain features of improvisation, composition, and structure. This
seminar will concentrate on a close examination of innovative literary
and media forms from the perspective of sound. It will involve careful
reading of experimental poetry, close listening to sound poetry, and
examination of digital media works, where applicable. The point will
be to establish a framework for what might be innovative in relation
to digital media design. This seminar will allow students the chance
to examine a wide range of experimental poetry and sound works, with
an emphasis on hearing the potential for innovative sound through a
focus on the marginal, the "other", jazz, dissonance, and works where
meaning is problemmatized. Attendance is crucial. Students will design
a final project based on material discussed in class. <U>Primary
