        <font size="+2" color="#FF0000">Survey of Digital Literature</font><br>
        T/R 4-5:50 PM, 112 CFA<br>
        Dr. Glazier<br>
      </p>
      <p>This course offers students the opportunity to conduct an intensive survey 
        of the field of digital literature through a focus on the screening of 
        digital texts. Primary emphasis will be on &quot;reading&quot; the digital 
        texts presented. Course will also cover the relationship of innovative 
        poetry to digital media, the phenomenon of the Internet and its relation 
        to &quot;the I&quot;, meaning-making through the context, design, and 
        writerly qualities of Web pages, traditions of hypertext, the materiality 
        of code, the history of e-poetry, and digital media poetry in the academy. 
        Special attention will be given to understanding a broad range of innovative 
        works in the medium including hypertext, digital and kinetic literature, 
        and works in networked and programmable media, and to examining, interpreting, 
        and interrogating the key theoretical texts of the most significant practitioners 
        in the field. The course will include foundational early theory, writings 
        from formative scholarly hypertext theorists, and work by more recent 
        cutting-edge independent digital theorists. Attention will be given to 
        the role of programming as a social, literary, and language-related act. 
        The cultural impact of films related to programming/cyberculture (Tron, 
        Tomb Raider, The Matrix, AI, etc.) will be discussed, with film screenings 
        as appropriate. Discussion of key cyberculture and media theory authors 
        as relevant. Online texts as appropriate, especially for a sense of current 
        research in the field. Course Requirements: midterm, final exam. Students 
        are encouraged to keep a screening journal. Text: Glazier, <i>Digital 
        Poetics</i>.</p>
