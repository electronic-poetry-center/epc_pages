      Prof. Loss Glazier
      <p>Programmable literature can be defined as new media writing that uses 
        programming and/or interactivity to generate varying content for different 
        readings. This emerging discipline is a truly dynamic field of digital 
        media poetics. This is a graduate-level course about reading programmable 
        literature and about relevant literary/digital theory. It will provide 
        detailed considerations of works by John Cayley, Philippe Bootz, Neil 
        Hennessey, Judd Morrissey/Lori Talley, Simon Biggs and others. The concept 
        of &quot;literature&quot; will extend to other implementations of programmability, 
        including diverse types of textual art machines. We will consider the 
        grammar of programming languages and will differentiate programming code 
        from scripting languages and simple mark-up. A survey of programming languages, 
        algorithmic thinking, and text manipulation programs will be included, 
        depending on student interest. We will look at some Language Poetry practices 
        as relating to programmability. We will consider the relation between 
        programmed variance and scholarly textual criticism. Theories of programmability 
        will be central to the course and will include a look at foundational 
        writings, including Turing, Babbage, Kittler, and others. Questions that 
        will be raised include how meaning is made when texts have multiple content, 
        how such multiple content can be tracked, how the scope of a work is determined, 
        and how you read between the variants to locate issues at the core of 
        such works. Course requirements: reading, oral presentation, final project, 
        digital or paper. If digital, final project may be a programming project, 
        text manipulation project, or variance analysis, digital or traditional; 
        if paper, given the newness of the field, it is hoped that paper can be 
        publishable. No programming/technical experience is required. Text: TBA.</p>
