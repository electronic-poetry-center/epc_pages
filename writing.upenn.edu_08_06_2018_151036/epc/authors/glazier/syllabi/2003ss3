      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this class the emphasis 
        will be on the writing of experimental and formally-innovative poetry, 
        that is, non-narrative poetry. We will investigate the experimental, the 
        improvizational, and broaden our horizons about the &quot;materials&quot; 
        of poetry. We will also keep a close eye on poetry as it relates to the 
        Web, including digital and other technologically mediated poetry, sound 
        poetry, and procedural writing. This class will involve reading essays 
        related to form and technique. An anthology of innovative poetry will 
        be assigned. (Reading poetry AS A POET will constitute part of our approach 
        to writing poetry.) Assignments of Web and other electronic sources will 
        also be given. Course content will also consist of additional lectures, 
        films, and out-of-class events. In addition to print poetry, students 
        interested in the production of multimedia and Web-based poetry are welcome. 
        Poetry writing exercises will be a regular part of class. Text: <i><font color="#FF00FF">In

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>COURSE REQUIREMENTS</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Grades: 25% class participation, 
        50% written responses, 25% quizzes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Reading. As the course description 
        indicates, this is a course for writers of poetry who are also readers 
        of poetry. Further, we will consider poetry in the broader concept of 
        &quot;poesis&quot; ... or making. That is, there are a number of art forms 
        (for example, music, painting, digital media arts, etc.) that can also 
        be part of our &quot;reading&quot;. We need to keep an open mind about 
        what might help us develop our poetry writing vision. The idea is to see 
        art in its larger context of engaging the materials of the given medium, 
        a fact of great importance to those who make art with words. The reading 
        for this course embodies various approaches to such a poesis. It is absolutely 
        crucial in developing the way we think about poetry, writing, and digital 
        media. It is required that you do ALL reading.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Writing assignments. To 
        be handed in each class are TWO assignments, a &quot;response text&quot; 
        AND a &quot;method text&quot;. These should be one page each in length 
        TYPED and, as a whole over the semester, constitute your final project. 
        Be prepared to read them in class as reading your work to others forms 
        a core of how we communicate in this class. Take some time with these, 
        they are central to the class and significant to your grade. MARK EACH 
        PAGE &quot;RESPONSE TEXT, DATE&quot; AND &quot;METHOD TEXT, DATE&quot; 
        ACCORDINGLY.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Response text. Response texts 
        express your thoughts and feelings on the reading. Take time to think 
        about the issues, styles, concepts, and materials the reading and essay 
        present to you as a writer. Write a one-page prose condensation of your 
        thoughts and reactions to the reading. Note: This can be informal in tone. 
        Research is not required.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Method text. Choose ONE text 
        from choices on syllabus. Write one page of poetry responding to the text. 
        Note source text at the top of the page. Ideally, your response will explore 
        the possibilities of the method of the chosen work. You may also take 
        an alternative approach in your response. REQUIRED: Two-line explanation 
        of how your method *works* in relation to the poem. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For my class what I'd like 
        to see is that you, sticking to the one-page page limits, take the methods 
        very seriously. Really try to see what a given poet's method is and then 
        let the method drive your writing assignments, rather than falling back 
        on your normal way of writing. I would like to see students let the methods 
        break apart their normal creative patterns, voices, and narrative modes, 
        so that this class can be a discovery of what new possibilities lie beneath, 
        the unacknowledged rich veins of creative possibility, an opportunity 
        to get outside of one's normal practice to expand one's perspective.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Additional oral presentations 
        may be also required.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Attendance 
        in the course and participation in discussion are <b>crucial</b>. As this 
        is a summer course and each class counts as a week of regular semester 
        class, students may only have one unexcused absence; one letter grade 
        will be subtracted for each additional unexcused absence. Required attendance 
        includes all lectures, films, and out-of-class events. Content of these 
        events will be covered on quizzes and exams. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Except 
        for documented emergencies, <u> <font color="#0000FF">THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS 
        TO CLASS ATTENDANCE POLICIES!</font></u></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">You must 
        complete all readings and turn in all written assignments. Points will 
        be deducted from your grade if you fail to satisfy these course requirements. 
        LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL <font color="#0000FF"><u>NOT</u></font> BE ACCEPTED. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Roll can be taken 
        at the beginning and/or at the end of class or at any time during class. 
        Since class is viewed as a collaborative learning experience, your presence 
        is crucial. Therefore, you are expected to attend every class, to be on 
        time, to stay until the end of class, and to return promptly from any 
        breaks. Any material missed due to tardiness or late returns from break 
        may affect your grade.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">You are required to 
        check the online syllabus each night before class. If you can also check 
        the syllabus during the day preceding each class that will also be helpful.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">You are required to 
        provide to the professor a valid e-mail address of your chosing. Additional 
        details about assignments and other class-related activities will be sent 
        via e-mail. You are required to check your e-mail frequently. NOTE: MESSAGES 
        SENT TO THE PROFESSOR MUST HAVE &quot;ENG 389&quot; AS PART OF THE SUBJECT 
        LINE.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Class content may 
        include out-of-class events, guest speakers, videos, sound events, performances, 
        and other non-book materials. You are encouraged to take notes on these 
        events as they are a crucial part of the course content. Some out-of-class 
        events may have additional expenses associated with them. As the cost 
        of text books for this course is relatively low, you are asked to have 
        some flexibility when it comes to such costs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Quizzes, exams, and 
        course assignments include not only the text but all material presented 
        in class, including lectures by the professor, videos, oral reports by 
        other students, study guides, and assigned out-of-class events.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Extra credit opportunities 
        are to be taken seriously. In my experience students with the highest 
        grades usually have also completed, when available, extra credit opportunities. 
        Take advantage of these when and if they are available.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">KEEP YOUR OWN COPIES 
        OF ALL MATERIALS HANDED IN. Material may not be returned and you are responsible 
        for proving material was turned in when due.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Requirements for this 
        course are someone rigorous. That is, I do not expect you to sit in the 
        audience and be sponges. I expect you to be AN ACTIVE PART of the new 
        threshholds we are crossing. I expect you to be proactive and involved. 
        In return, I anticipate that you will have a most uncommon learning experience, 
        ripe with the richness of new artistic frontiers.</font></p>

        REPORTS (IF APPLICABLE)</b></i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Oral report 
        should last 10 minutes. The report should contain: (1) brief b</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">iography 
        of the artists or brief history of the topic; (2) social context narrative 
        (see following explanation); and (3) a &quot;reading&quot; of a short 
        piece of work by the artist. The biography should be brief, giving the 
        most significant moments for the subject. The social context narrative 
        should give a picture of the artist or topic in his/her/ira time, with 
        special attention to the social context (i.e., what was happening in the 
        world surrounding the artist). It should illustrate the artistic context 
        for the artist or of the topic. For example, if a musician, what engagement 
        did the artist have with the literary world. What were the movies, novels, 
        dominant art world movements, political fears, social conditions of the 
        time. If a poet, what music were they listening to? The &quot;reading&quot; 
        means to take a poem or piece of music and give an explanation of, based 
        on the insights you gained from the biography/history and the social context 
        narrative, take us through the piece and show what it might be trying 
        to express, what is behind its ideas, what are its nuances. NOTES: Please 
        make sure your presentation is between 8-10 minutes. Do a rehearsal and 
        time it in advance of your presentation. You should provide a handout 
        for the class. You should also hand in a one-page summary of your main 
        points to me.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p>
