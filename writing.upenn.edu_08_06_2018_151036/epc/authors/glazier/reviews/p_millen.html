<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">The pressure upon anthologists
is intense at the dawn of a new century; the fact of such a threshold
seems to demand some canon or list that will define what we actually
did in the nineteen somethings.  Witness the large number of anthologies
presently hitting the shelves and the amount of debate surrounding
them. The most contentious of entrants into the arena of &quot;the
definitive anthology&quot; are those that lay out a school-particularly
of living writers-in order to circumscribe a field of &quot;legitimate&quot;
activity.  For example, on the front lines of how postmodern poetry
should be defined, blows have been exchanged among a number of
pugnacious tomes, including <I>From the Other Side of the Century:
A New American Poetry 1960-1990, Postmodern Poetry: A Norton Anthology,
The Heath Anthology of American Literature, </I>Volume 2, <I>American
Poetry Since 1950: Innovators and Outsiders: An Anthology, </I>and
<I>The</I> <I>Art of Practice: 45 Contemporary Poets.<a href="p_millen.html#1">1</a> </I>Though
no one is excluded from having his or her favorite in this fracas,
the point here is that there are stakes-and they seem high precisely
because of a present need to define our century.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">Anthologies are controversial
because they define by excluding.  They also enter a field fecund
for debate because anthologies suggest that written works can
be characterized by lineage or coherences and that some sort of
map can be drawn. (Whether this map is considered definitive vs.
propositional usually depends on the ego of the editor.) What
alternatives are there to a view of writing as fixed, classifiable,
and in need of order?  If one looks at writing as <I>practice
</I>rather than product, a much more flexible &quot;history&quot;
can be charted.  Thus an anthology can only begin to succeed when
it positions its material <I>within a history of practice </I>rather
than presenting its selections as a definition of what such a
practice is.  It is by this criterion that <I>Poems for the Millennium
</I>succeeds impeccably.  It is a surprisingly fresh and effective
approach to anthologizing (not experienced perhaps since <I>Technicians
of the Sacred), </I>an approach that not only seems to chart some
poetic terrain but actually redefines the possibilities of the
anthology while doing so.  <I>Poems for the Millennium </I>is
not an anthology of a specific school, nor of a specific nationality,
nor of a rigidly asserted definition of style.  What <I>Poems
for the Millennium </I>offers is a selection of works that form
a history of the practice <I>of experimental writing itself, </I>a
crucial history of poetry in this century in the West.  This anthology
offers a collection that has not appeared elsewhere, one that
might otherwise be difficult to come by, and is one, despite how
you might wish to argue its shades of meaning, integral to the
literary history of this century.  <I>Poems for the Millennium
</I>is of immediate interest to any reader or teacher of twentieth-century
writing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre
Joris are excellently suited to the task of presenting this history.
 Both are widely known poets who have been active for decades.
 Joris is a Luxembourg native who, fluent in many European languages,
has also translated works by authors such as Maurice Blanchot,
Jean-Pierre Duprey, Kurt Schwitters, and Paul Celan.  Rothenberg,
also a translator, has received much acclaim for editing two previous
ground breaking anthologies, <I>Technicians of the Sacred: A Range
of Poetries from Africa, America, Asia, Europe &amp; Oceania </I>and
<I>Shaking the Pumpkin: Traditional Poetry of the Indian North
Americas.  </I>These anthologies not only presented a wealth of
previously unavailable works, but changed the way many writers
and teachers viewed literature itself<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">So why another anthology,
especially given the present flood of well-intentioned collections
of the poetry of this century?  Because with all the canons, counter-canons,
schools, and movements, no anthology of the history of innovation
in our century has appeared.  Further, views of modern poetry,
in the words of Rothenberg and Joris, &quot;have tended to play
down the more revolutionary aspects of modernism in favor of the
recognition of a handful </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">of 'major' figures, many of
whom are celebrated precisely for their antiexperimental and antirevolutionary
positions or for their adherence to a relatively conventional
view of poetic traditions and formal possibilities.&quot; The
editors were careful not to turn &quot;the selection of authors
into the projection of a new canon of famous names.&quot; Instead,
they wish &quot;to have the anthology serve a more useful function,
as a mapping of the possibilities that have come down to us by
the century's turning&quot; (3).What else is missing from some
of the competing major anthologies?  One of the arguments of <I>Poems
for the Millennium </I>is against the notion of the twentieth
century as an &quot;American century&quot; in favor of an international
view.  How were works selected for this anthology?  Rothenberg
and Joris state carefully that their interests were not in &quot;a
superficial avant-gardism&quot;; rather they sought to identify
works which &quot;Significantly test the limits of poetry, both
from a structural and an experimental point of view&quot; (13).
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman"> Poems for the Millennium
</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">begins with St&eacute;phane
Mallarm&eacute;s <I>Coup de d&egrave;s </I>of 1897, which, the
editors state, &quot;finished the nineteenth century's fade-out
into an overly aestheticized Symbolism and marked the beginning
of the twentieth's relentless transformations&quot; (5) and covers
major experimental movements typified by a strong presence of
poets.  The volume ends with Negritude, positing that movement
&quot;as the culminating moment of the modernist half of the twentieth
century&quot; and as &quot;a developing response to the decentered/decentering
universe of postcolonial reality&quot; (7).  This assertion is
not only thought-provoking but helps set the literary record into
its global and economic perspective. (I do wonder, however, if
Langston Hughes and Harlem Renaissance writers might be similarly
considered as responding to internal colonialism.  It's a shame
to see Hughes mixed into a larger, more general section when he
may have shared a political perspective with the Negritude writers.
 Even worse, theirs is a rather sparsely constituted movement
in this anthology.) Rothenberg and Joris do include most major
modernist authors, but one real exhilaration provided by this
volume is to see such authors out of their brigadier-general uniforms
and in the ranks of the infantry.  Exemplifying this fact, there
is no section called &quot;Modernism&quot;: Pound, Williams, H.D.,
are mixed in by birth date into galleries with a wide array of
other writers.  Such a de-canonization not only allows a fresh
reading of authors who have been the mainstay of what we might
call the information superhighway of modernism, but allows one
to begin to think in terms of other possibilities of literary
relation, peers, and context.  It<B> </B>might be said that some
of these well-known innovators, Pound, Stevens, and Eliot especially
(whose The <I>Waste Land </I>is merely a place marker in this
volume!) are much underrepresented.  The radical recontextualizing
undertaken by Rothenberg and Joris is ultimately a wild reading
through the <I>other </I>texts of our century, a trip down the
Route 66 of what really happened; it's not about the canon but
about works equal in daring and vitality and commitment to those
we have been trained to appreciate.  If there is any flaw to this
presentation (other than the intentional ones), despite its acute
arguments for an informed politics and politics of language, it
is the lack of a chronology of feminist practice or a presentation
of some early writing breakthroughs made by women in the political
position of being female.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman"> How is this anthology different
in its presentation of material?  There are of course a limited
number of choices available to any such collection.  Authors may
be presented alphabetically, by date of birth or publication,
or within sections according to movement or affiliation. <I>Poems
for the Millennium </I>manages to combine a number of these approaches
in its innovative sequencing of writing.  Much work is presented
in tightly conceived &quot;movement&quot; sections (Futurisms,
Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism, Objectivism, and Negritude).These
sections are supplemented by three other large sections, &quot;larger,
loosely chronological 'galleries' of individual poets, without
a stress on particular affinities or interconnections between
those represented&quot; (12).  The galleries then create the opportunity
to present authors without stretching them when the affiliation
is not immediate.  A difference in presentation also occurs in
this anthology's insistence on the importance of manifestoes and
other documentary writings.  Finally, eschewing the authoritative
demeanor of note form, contextual information is delivered through
&quot;commentaries&quot; for each movement and for individual
poets in the galleries and &quot;forerunners&quot; and &quot;origins&quot;
sections.  The commentaries of course weave a continuing metatextual
narrative; they are so engagingly written that it is also satisfying
to simply skip through the pages of the book reading these brief
expositions.  The &quot;forerunners&quot; section makes perfect
sense. The spirit of experimentalism documented here--poetry which
shows &quot;that poetry set free can free or open up the human
mind&quot; (l)--did not begin on any given date.  It is useful
to consider what following this thread back in literary history
reveals.  The &quot;origins&quot; section may make less sense.
 Its point is to stress larger ethnopoetic origins of writing
and poetic speech in our century.  This is an important point,
of course, but one that is perhaps somewhat too sketchy in its
seventy pages here for those familiar with Rothenberg's earlier
large anthologies. The only drawback to this sectional configuration
is at the beginning.  &quot;Origins&quot; is followed by a &quot;gallery&quot;
before the first historical section begins.  Thus there are 190
pages of these loosely-connected poems before a first movement
begins, a sizable portion of the book and a somewhat disorienting
beginning for readers who may seek a better defined progression.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">The biggest reward of <I>Poems
for the Millennium </I>is how lavish, within a restricted economy,
the editors have been with their attentions.  Though this is an
enormous book (800 pages), and it presents only a microscopic
amount of the material, such a collection could contain, the editors
do not rush their guests off the stage.  For example, plates accompany
some work where pertinent. There are reproductions of Blake's
work, Dickinson's fascicles, an occasional painting integral to
or standing as a text, and collages by Max Ernst, among others.
 Further, writing is given its room where necessary, as in the
generous reproduction of Mallarm&eacute;'s <I>Coup de d&egrave;s
</I>with its lush typography and grand use of white space.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">As many of its supporters
have suggested, <I>Poems for the Millennium </I>reconfigures poetic
space for the first part of the twentieth century.  It dismantles
the halls of fame instituted by academic paparazzi and builds
in their place an architecture that is more open and more suggestive
of the possibilities of a poetry that is global in interest, ethnopoetically
positioned, diverse in language of creation, and attentive to
the important alliances which writing makes with the visual and
other arts. This volume is complete in itself-and it is important
to accept it as a complete work.  Though one may look forward
to the forthcoming second volume that will bring this anthology
to the present (perhaps a much more difficult task without the
advantage of a historical perspective), the great achievement
is already here: we have before us a portrait like no other of
the formative portion of a turbulent and fertile century, the
prophecies of which we continue to inhabit.<BR>
