As in the writer's duplicitous "I."
Fact of chaos can become tiring
when you do not choose it. Don't

forget that the routine, tangled, is
rupture. What  hour emerges or emits
suppressed. Blanket over possible

breathings. Must lie quietly, as with
the catheter, wait for what might be
outside to rise to coagulations on

surface. The example was that Rimbaud
went not to Ethiopia but to Southern
California as revealed on the Net.
 How they go to the "library" in oak counters,
expecting to find me there. Hands cupped to

mouth speaking quickly over beverages, Sounds
missing in house. Tatum's harmonic imagination

writing in fits. Eye direct through the entire con-
versation and voice finally volleys nervously

impossible to take serious. Hands under I-Ching
verbs serious as exposure that must accommodate

any form of surface style. Required that ancillary
"voice" in the bibliography seen in patent prose.
