style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Nicholodeon</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> by Darren Wershler-Henry is a movie in the 
        form a codex: you do not read it as much you view it. Each page provides 
        a backdrop for the screening of its jittery montage, the film partly jammed 
        in the reel of its faltering projector, the celluloid devoured by the 
        slow burn of the lamp. The book is a black-and-white movie that resurrects 
        the phantom of a dead poet, only to illuminate the pedantic vampires who 
        scavenge around the corpse. You can watch the many acts of necrophilia 
        perpetrated by the academy in the name of concocted nostalgia and borrowed 
        prestige. The price: only five cents per ode.</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Nicholodeon</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> reappraises the poetic legacy of bpNichol. 
        What Canadian can claim to have done more than him to popularize the poetic 
        values of linguistic radicalism in Canada? What Canadian has ever earned 
        the slavish respect of all the literate doodlers and nonsense mumblers 
        in Toronto? No poet has done so much to defy the philistine mediocrity 
        of the academy, even though many of his peers, the university babyboomers, 
        have done their best to sentimentalize his subversiveness: they prefer 
        to indulge in hagiolatry, romanticizing their own memories of him at the 
        expense of his most experimental achievements.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Frank Davey has observed that 
        bpNichol does indeed suffer from an &quot;honorific criticism&quot; (1986:169) 
        that makes little effort to discriminate between the mortal issue of the 
        writer's life and the formal value of the writer's work. When Barbour, 
        for example, writes that readers of <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> feel 
        a &quot;great love&quot; directed by bpNichol to the audience (1986:223), 
        do we not hear the hint of a sigh in the face of saintly virtues? When 
        Scobie argues that, for bpNichol, the use of language constitutes an act 
        of &quot;humility&quot; (1984:13), are we not persuaded to genuflect before 
        the poetic martyr who, three times, waves away the laurel?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>When Tostevin inserts the 
        &quot;master-name&quot; (1995:[75]) of bpNichol into her own imaginary 
        cartouche, juxtaposing the memorial sign of her dead mentor with the memorial 
        sign of her dead father ([71]), does she not idealize the power of an 
        Egyptian patronym, whose pharaonic authority can indemnify her nostalgia? 
        When Tostevin imagines granting bpNichol &quot;the amulet of the ladder&quot; 
        ([28]), otherwise known as the &quot;the sign for H&quot; ([28]), does 
        she not also imagine accruing for bpNichol, if not by default, for herself, 
        the power to climb up this &quot;one-rung ladder&quot; ([28]) to the canonized 
        afterlife of Cloudtown?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Anxieties of influence have 
        spawned the worst forms of devotion among the most awestruck disciples 
        of bpNichol (many of whom do nothing more than pour dust from urn to urn): 
        for example, Irene Niechoda has incrementally merged the name of the poet 
        with her own normal byline in the <i>Sourcery</i> (1992: [3]), just as 
        Michael Holmes has sacrificially marred his own body with the tattooed 
        likeness of &quot;H (An Alphabet).&quot; Inspired by the charisma of bpNichol, 
        Karasick has responded to his work in academic seminars by indulging in 
        glossolalic lucubration, earning a degree for her chicanery.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry greets such 
        acts of vampiric flattery with a certain disdain, arguing that the iconoclasm 
        of Nichol provides a model for iconoclastic, not reverential, behaviour: 
        &quot;[t]he sacred is interesting insofar as it supplies a series of useful 
        targets&quot; (1997b:109): i.e. sacred cattle for mutilation by an unidentified 
        intelligence. Rather than deify bpNichol, recycling his celebrity as a 
        commodity, why not condemn such euphemistic necrophilia? Why not apply 
        the whimsical procedures of bpNichol to bpNichol himself? Why not expand 
        his old work in order to invent new work beyond the constraint of such 
        apotheosis?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry writes that, 
        in <i>Nicholodeon,</i> he intends to move beyond the &quot;anecdotal 'I 
        knew bp when' mode of […] criticism&quot; (1997:18) in order to upbraid 
        critics who do not apply what they learn from the most radical lessons 
        of bpNichol. How can such critics ignore the praxis of their own language 
        after they extoll a writer who calls their language into question? The 
        obsessive rehearsal of such obsequy over the years has done little except 
        endorse a cult of personality, in which critics shy away from the most 
        radicalized innovations of the poetic martyr in order to portray his romantic 
        humanism as avant-garde.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Consider <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology.</i> 
        Barbour suggests that &quot;<i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> announces <i>itself</i> 
        <i>as</i> <i>a</i> <i>postmodern</i> <i>text</i>&quot; (1988:172), largely 
        because the poem foregrounds its own self-conscious deconstructions and 
        self-justified indeterminacies: for example, Scobie argues that the text 
        &quot;deconstructs&quot; the linearity of its own narrative <i>grammar</i> 
        (1984:134); Kamboureli argues that the text &quot;deconstructs&quot; the 
        authority of its own narrative <i>subject</i> (1991:148); and Kroetsch 
        argues that the text &quot;deconstructs&quot; the necessity of its own 
        narrative <i>closure</i> (1989:119)--i.e. the text is postmodern if it 
        makes a theme of its own poetic quirks.</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>The</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> <i>Martyrology</i> may celebrate a fractious 
        plurality of voices; however, the poem still provokes a marvelous consensus. 
        Critic after critic belabours the lexicon of Derrida in order to imply 
        that such a poetic memoir is &quot;pomo&quot; because its open-ended, 
        many-sided form problematizes every category of aesthetic certitude. Only 
        a small cabal of poets has so far hesitated to rubberstamp this prevailing 
        assessment, implying that, despite the hyperbole, such an epic opus about 
        the loss of the epic is, alas, more humanistic, more modernized, than 
        postmodern, since bpNichol, despite knowing better, still seeks ontological 
        reassurance.</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>The</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> <i>Martyrology</i> is, sadly, not pomo because, 
        despite all of its alleged efforts to subvert humanist ontology, the text 
        nevertheless reiterates the spiritual anxieties of modernism, substituting 
        a poetic gain for a mythic loss, replacing an old ideology with what bpNichol 
        might call &quot;a new humanism&quot; (1967:[1]). Does the text not imagine 
        a &quot;re2(al)gion&quot;--&quot;a region of the real/ uncharted/ (largely)&quot; 
        (Book 6:1 Hour 4)--a regime where bard and monk might indulge in the cabalistic 
        compulsion to find a meaningful, but unexpected, coincidence in an anagram 
        of letters? Does the poet not look for the lord in l or d?</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>The</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> <i>Martyrology</i> compensates for the pomo 
        loss of secure values by finding consolation in the &quot;puncertainty&quot; 
        (Book 6:2 Hour 22) of a lingual sublime. <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> 
        looks for its saints, not in the outdated pantheon of gods, but in the 
        extended paragram of puns: St. And; St. Ein; St. Ranglehold, etc. Wershler-Henry 
        has observed on many an occasion over coffee that bpNichol might have 
        written a pomo text simply by studying, not the &quot;martyrs&quot; of 
        a private myth, but the &quot;doctors&quot; of a secular code: Dr. Ink; 
        Dr. Unk; Dr. Essingroom. Why not give each word a Ph.D.? (Lot of good 
        the degree has done us.)</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Kamboureli avers that, despite 
        these facts, &quot;<i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> [...] deconstructs the 
        Cartesian ego&quot; (1991:148), sabotaging all the secure biases of humanist 
        ontology (148); nevertheless, Derksen shows that <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> 
        dramatizes, not the postmodern disruption, but the modernist endurance, 
        of metaphysical subjectivity: &quot;<i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> seems 
        to display how much dispersal the Cartesian ego can take and, at the same 
        time, like a Timex watch, keep on ticking&quot; (1997:56). While the text 
        may flirt with its own paragrammatic decomposition, such dispersal rarely 
        strays beyond the limits of a humanist standard.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Lowry observes that, although 
        <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> has accorded students some welcome relief 
        from the staid norms of thematic exegesis, the text still fulfills a humanist 
        function within the identity-politics of Canlit, retrofitting, for Canada, 
        the kind of traditional romanticism, bequeathed to us by Britain: &quot;Nichol's 
        life-long poem becomes an extension of Wordsworth's life-long poem&quot; 
        (1997:71). What then is <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i>? It is <i>The</i> 
        <i>Prelude</i> dreaming of becoming a crossword-puzzle. It is a modernist 
        chronicle about the life of a poet, whose wordplay strives, like a personal 
        gematria, to express the ineffable.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>McCaffery concludes, therefore, 
        that &quot;<i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i> [...] fails to exploit the potential 
        field of knowledge [that] it opens up to itself&quot; (1988:77), largely 
        because the text does not push its paragrammatic potentiality to an extreme 
        beyond the lingual &quot;detente&quot; (77) that it negotiates with the 
        academy. Cabri, likewise, concludes that the &quot;threat of the paragram--to 
        structurally breach this 'reality' at every phoneme--proves in Nichol 
        to be benign&quot; (1997:148), since his wordplay capitulates to the humanist 
        mandates of liberal decorum, reaffirming a faith in meaning, despite questioning 
        every basis for writing.</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>The</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> <i>Martyrology</i> appears to suffer from 
        the same kind of misprision that has plagued the study of postmodern literature 
        in Canada. Just as Hutcheon argues oxymoronically that, for Canlit, the 
        anti-classic, anti-mimetic agenda of the pomo text finds itself expressed 
        primarily in realist writing (1984:20), so also do critics of bpNichol 
        mistake the ludic style of his lyric verse for postmodern radicalism. 
        Such critics evade any critical encounter with, the truly scary, avant-garde: 
        they ignore the rare cases of a more experimental genre in order to depict, 
        as progressive, the many cases of a more conservative genre.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>When threatened by the avant-garde, 
        such critics must rally around the least weird text by the most teachable 
        dissenter. Such critics fail to see that, unlike the modernist aesthetic, 
        whose humanism preserves a mythomanic nostalgia in the face of a nihilistic 
        prognosis, the pomo view rejects such nostalgia, refusing to find solace 
        in any aesthetic that is realist or lyrical--no matter how self-conscious 
        or self-justified it might be. Such critics, nevertheless, teach this 
        kind of work as, yet another, stylistic candidate for the canon without 
        ever having to rethink their own investment in the value of humanist pedagogy.</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>The</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> <i>Martyrology</i> has overshadowed every 
        other text by bpNichol (largely because his long-poem lends his life-work 
        an imaginary coherence, unifying his career under the reassuring, but 
        inhibiting, aegis of humanistic legitimacy). Critics, however, forget 
        that bpNichol has written yet another poetic series, one coincident with 
        his &quot;masterpiece,&quot; but nevertheless, more experimental, more 
        'pataphysical, and thus more recalcitrant to such a scholastic enterprise: 
        <i>Love</i> (a book of remembrances) and <i>Zygal</i> (a book of translations); 
        not to mention, <i>Art</i> <i>Facts</i> (a book of contexts) and <i>Truth</i> 
        (a book of fictions).</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Unlike <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i>, 
        these four opuscules exemplify all the repressed qualities of a pomo text 
        without blatantly resorting to the lyrical refrains of modernist nostalgia. 
        Such an alternate tetralogy records the evolution of a writing-process 
        without recourse to emotional biography; instead, these four books report 
        upon a radical science of paragrammatical experimentation, documenting 
        absurd &quot;proofs&quot; that call to mind, not only an algebraic syllogism, 
        but also the idea of a &quot;rough draft.&quot; Such proofs are &quot;probable,&quot; 
        not because they can be proven, but because they can be probed. They are 
        &quot;probe-able&quot; systems.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Unlike <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i>, 
        such a quartet of books puts into practice the kind of research imagined 
        by bpNichol and McCaffery during their acts of collaborative investigation 
        for the Toronto Research Group. Rather than embrace a royal science (whose 
        theories preserve autocratic stances and imperative tactics), such a thinktank 
        studies a nomad science: <i>rational</i> <i>geomancy</i>--a science, for 
        which &quot;all research is symbiotic&quot; (TRG 1992:23) with its scription, 
        finding new uses for old forms, putting into play, if not at risk, the 
        very propriety of reasoning itself: &quot;these reports make no pretence 
        to [...] professorial legitimation&quot; (12).</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>When bpNichol speculates about 
        the secret history of an &quot;alphabet cult&quot; (1990:25) or calculates 
        the value of a poetic account in &quot;base alphabet&quot; (99), he invites 
        academic ridicule, arguing that, to his chagrin, &quot;there are those 
        who [...] wish to suppress this line of research&quot; (28). How can vaunted 
        critics, trained in thematic exegesis, respond (without condescension) 
        to the seemingly trivial opacity of bpNichol, his uncanny reports, his 
        cartoon doodles, his waggish puzzles (all of which display to the extreme 
        the kind of postmodern attributes mistakenly attributed to his own hagiographic 
        encyclopedia)?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>When bpNichol explores the 
        absurd limits of a fragmentary abstraction (as if jotting down witty memos 
        to himself), he shows that, at best, the academy can tolerate, but cannot 
        completely appreciate, a style of hermeneusis that lampoons the genre 
        of hermeneusis itself. Given that his critics have usually fixated <i>ad</i> 
        <i>nauseum</i> upon the lore of his poetic saints, is it not fair to say 
        that his alternate tetralogy has been martyred on behalf of a logophilic 
        prayerbook? Why do critics, who profess to be interested in the pomo view, 
        nevertheless ignore the very work that deflates all thematic, if not all 
        semantic, analysis?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry redresses such 
        neglect by responding to the radical lessons of this tetralogy: &quot;[t]hese 
        books have always been very important to me; I think that they contain 
        writing that is ultimately more interesting and provocative than anything 
        in <i>The</i> <i>Martyrology</i>&quot; (1997b:110). Wershler-Henry reads 
        these books in order to modify his own critical practice as an academic. 
        Rather than respond to the various lessons learned from all the myriad 
        genres of writing by writing in only one genre (the essay), he responds 
        to each work in the same form as such work, writing visual poetry that 
        analyzes visual poetry, etc.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry argues that 
        the critic is no less obliged than the artist to invent a new way of writing: 
        &quot;the job of these poems is to produce a vague sense of anxiety in 
        the reader&quot; (1997a:[89]). While we may live amid a visual regime 
        of icons and logos, &quot;the response of a typical reader to anything 
        glyphic is, paradoxically, to ignore its material qualities in favour 
        of some other, absent text to which it allegedly alludes: 'oh, the bathroom's 
        this way...'&quot; (1997b:105). Is it not the duty of the poet to install 
        &quot;traffic signs from a parallel world&quot; (1997a:[89]) in order 
        to prevent us from ever finding the loo?</span></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Like Robert Smithson, 
        laughing in the planetarium because of a sign, whose arrow points the 
        way to both the Solar System and the Rest Rooms (1996:27), Wershler-Henry 
        directs us toward the void, the linguistic interstice, in between words 
        and things--an interzone, where &quot;systems of knowing [...] may seem 
        irrational or startling, but are, nevertheless, reasoned&quot; (1998:11). 
        Like the Toronto Research Group, Wershler-Henry explores the 'pataphysical 
        potentiality of such an epistemic interzone, inventing alien modes of 
        unorthodox translation in order to cross the abyss between Now/here and 
        Nowhere (1997b:113).</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry tries to build 
        a poetic bridge, a <i>zygal,</i> which can span this bicameral rift, thereby 
        linking together the two hemispheres of Coach House Press, (one defunct, 
        one revived) (1997b:112); nevertheless, such a bridge remains as unfinished 
        as the one described by William Gibson in <i>Virtual</i> <i>Light</i> 
        (a novel that Wershler-Henry cites): &quot;The integrity of its span was 
        rigourous [...], yet around this had grown another reality, intent upon 
        its own agenda. This had occurred piecemeal to no set plan, employing 
        every imaginable technique and material. The result was something amorphous, 
        startling&quot; (1998:11).</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry builds his 
        bridge by finding a new use for the leftover concrete from the legacy 
        of visual poetry: &quot;[c]oncrete takes no notice of what is done with 
        it, flowing into any container; and the container [that] one makes for 
        it, the molds and forms, must be fashioned with laborious care, strong 
        and tight&quot; (1997a:[7]). When using such a feckless material, &quot;we 
        are faced with the impossibility of building something totally new&quot; 
        (1998:11), but are nevertheless bound by &quot;the responsibility to maintain 
        [...] the ruins that we build on, without romanticizing them&quot; (11). 
        Let no tome, in other words, become a tomb.</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Nicholodeon</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> refuses to mummify bpNichol inside the mausoleum 
        of a lyric or an elegy. Unlike Tostevin, who idealizes an Egyptian mystique 
        (with all of its transcendental significations), Wershler-Henry rehearses 
        the ludic style of bpNichol, replacing the name of the poet with an Egyptian 
        wordgame, a rebus, whose pictures of a bee and a pea produce, not an icon, 
        but a &quot;lowerglyph&quot;--a debased, yet genetic, metonym for the 
        organism of language itself. Such a cartouche is a seedpod of cocoons, 
        ready to burst open, like the front cover of a book, pollenating us with 
        larval spores that we, in turn, incubate and transmit.</span></p>
      <p><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'><i>Nicholodeo</i>n is a poetic series of 
        obituaries, each one situated &quot;at the clear spot&quot; ([30]), a 
        blank hole, not unlike the &quot;VAC     M&quot; ([68]) of an absence 
        that is, paradoxically, &quot;em ty but full&quot; ([34]). Just as the 
        death of Bartlebooth in <i>Life: A User's Manual</i> by Georges Perec 
        coincides with the inability to fit a letter-shaped puzzle-piece, a W, 
        into the last hole of a jigsaw-puzzle (1987:497), so also does the death 
        of David UU leave a lingual puzzle incomplete (since the absence of his 
        last name, a pun on the letter W, makes a hole in the very word for such 
        an absence). The missing letters become a cipher for the lost body of 
        a poet.</span> </p>
      <p><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'><i>Nicholodeon</i> x-rays the remains of 
        such an exquisite corpse, on the assumption that writing is itself postmortem. 
        Writing is a kind of taxidermy, in which the critic becomes a literary 
        coroner, dismantling, then restitching, the &quot;Glossotype&quot; (1997a:[22]) 
        of foreign tongues. Where Frankenstein meets Wittgenstein, there the critic 
        might discover the anatomy of a poetic martyr: &quot;[i]magine each page 
        of this book as an embalmed cross-section [...] of some exotic body&quot; 
        ([89]), in which &quot;[t]he black marks [...] constitute the outlines 
        of capillaries&quot; ([89]), once flowing with vital essence, but now 
        clogged with &quot;tarry residue&quot; ([89]).</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Nicholodeon</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> performs a radical autopsy upon the corpus 
        of bpNichol, dissecting the ganglia of his influence, &quot;the rhizome 
        of an author-function in mourning&quot; (1997b:101). Knowing that bpNichol 
        integrates himself into an avant-garde collective by publishing a group 
        of peers in Ganglia Press, Wershler-Henry studies the Turin Shroud that 
        depicts the anatomy of such a legacy (1997a:[43]). When &quot;a dead body 
        broadcasts aphrodisiac hallucinations&quot; ([25]), &quot;crowds gather 
        around the lethal nodes of becoming&quot; ([25]), filing past the sarcophagus, 
        like pilgrims or tourists, who stand in line for hours to see the body 
        of a dead czar.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Exquisite, as such a literary 
        skeleton might be, it is nevertheless a hybrid entity, the Siamese version 
        of a horrible misbirth (1997a:[83]), in which two heads have become grafted 
        upon one body. Unable to separate the conjoined &quot;twins,&quot; the 
        authorial functions of bpNichol and McCaffery, because of their &quot;We-full, 
        not [...] I-less paradigm&quot; (TRG 1992:11), critics have usually buried 
        any evidence of such freakish teratism, eliding the shared corpus of the 
        two poets, lauding bpNichol at the expense of McCaffery, all the while 
        archiving work done in collaboration as if it is the work of one man, 
        not two.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry implies that, 
        for the &quot;nicholphilia&quot; (1997a:[7]) of the academy, &quot;physical 
        death is the mother of privilege&quot; ([24]), sanctioning all the accolades 
        of posterity. Has not bpNichol literally fulfilled his role as the undead 
        corpse in &quot;Nary-A-Tiff&quot; (TRG 1992:222), persisting critically 
        after death, his body exhumed from the cemetery, every now and then for 
        a festschrift or two, even as McCaffery has, while still alive, suffered 
        relative neglect (despite being the more intellectually sophisticated 
        poet)? Has not McCaffery remarked that, in a single stroke, his collection 
        of bpNichol has doubled in value (TRG 1992:219)?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Knowing that Coach House has 
        resurrected itself as an electronic small-press by capitalizing upon these 
        recent spates of &quot;beepymania,&quot; Wershler-Henry insists that, 
        if writers must loot the name of bpNichol for the sake of their careers, 
        then  surely they can extract from it some novelty, the element of &quot;surprise 
        as the rarest form of earth&quot; (1997a:[30]). Rather than explain or 
        imitate, preserving his work in a mausoleum, why not expropriate bpNichol? 
        Mine his work for &quot;obtainium&quot; (1997a:[9]), a magnetic material, 
        as &quot;[p]romiscuous&quot; ([7]) as concrete, doing &quot;anything for 
        anyone, without protest&quot; ([7]), so long as the person is strong enough 
        to hold this &quot;antimatter [that]/ eludes our grasp&quot; ([61])?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry performs a 
        radical alchemy upon the corpus of bpNichol, forging the &quot;mettle 
        not metal&quot; (1997a:[36]) needed to transmute lead-type into a Nichol, 
        not a nickel, alloy<i>--</i>the kind of fissile element that can fill 
        the outmoded typecase with a new set of &quot;Collected Allegories,&quot; 
        each one &quot;a metaphor for <i>Nicholodeon</i> as a whole&quot; ([91]). 
        Does not the legacy of a poet take on &quot;the status of moveable type, 
        pointing to the infinite number of possible alphabets that lie beyond 
        zebra&quot; ([91])? Must we not do what we can to rearrange the set of 
        toy letter-blocks left behind by kids of the book-machine?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry suggests that 
        such a new poetics must dramatize the effect of artificial discourses--and 
        nowhere does this premise appear more obvious than during his use of the 
        Klingon language to create a sci-fi <i>lautgedichte.</i> Such a text implies 
        that, in the modern milieu, poetry has become so heteroclite, so nonsensical, 
        that it is now little more than an alien idiom, like the hieroglyphs of 
        a Klinzhai alphabet, its characters unreadable, except in the neverland 
        of speculative imagination: &quot;since Klingon contains no equivalent 
        for the word 'car,' [...] this text reads 'primitive shuttlecraft'&quot; 
        (1997a:[90]).</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry also suggests 
        that a new poetics must dramatize the effect of mechanical procedures--and 
        nowhere does this premise appear more obvious than during his use of the 
        Babble! software to create a cut-up <i>merzgedichte.</i> Such a text implies 
        that, no matter how delirious, no matter how libidinal, &quot;the phonemes 
        of rapture&quot; (1997a:[24]) might be under the constraints of oneiric 
        writing, such acts of unassisted surrealism pale in comparison to the 
        truly automatic scription of a digitalized ghostwriter<i>--</i>a prosthesis 
        for our own unconscious inspiration: &quot;It is the spine made malevolent. 
        It twitters.&quot; ([24]).</span></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Just as the Toronto 
        Research Group, argues that, between writer and reader, &quot;[t]here 
        is at all points a machine that secretes and a machine that consumes&quot; 
        (1992:172), so also does Wershler-Henry insist that language is a cyborganic 
        phenomenon, in which we do not translate words into meaning so much as 
        dissipate forms into function. If a capital economy must preserve the 
        linguistic efficiency of these machines by computerizing our language 
        and by standardizing our rhetoric, then surely we must sabotage whatever 
        is utilitarian in any poetic device, deploying it in a manner wholly contrary 
        to its intended function.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>When Wershler-Henry uses his 
        Microsoft program, for example, to correct the phonetic spelling in a 
        poem by Bissett, the software fails to work on behalf of semantic lucidity, 
        translating the desire for errata into a comedy of errors, so that, when 
        confronted, say, with the word &quot;uv,&quot; the device does not read 
        it as &quot;of,&quot; the correct variant, but as &quot;ultraviolet&quot; 
        (1997a:[68]). Just as the gears of a printing-press drag Bissett, screaming, 
        into their own mechanism, so also do the codes of a spelling-check drag 
        the poem, gibbering, into their own formalism: &quot;the machines were 
        thundering on, turning fat ultraviolet&quot; ([68]).</span></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>If computers must constrain 
        us as tightly as corsets, making us write like &quot;fucking accountants&quot; 
        (1997a:[93]), then surely we must learn &quot;how to print/ with an offset 
        bodice&quot; ([68]). If wordprocessors can, for the sake of convenience, 
        come equipped with a &quot;mindreader&quot; that not only anticipates 
        keystrokes to be made, but also consummates completion of a word (even 
        before we finish typing the initial letters)--then what prevents such 
        machines from turning &quot;new wave films, flickering&quot; into &quot;new 
        york city with fiduciary flooring&quot; ([20])? Do we not see these &quot;windfall 
        machines planning hidden interests&quot; ([20])?</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>McCaffery implies that any 
        act against such a covert agenda is an exercise in &quot;FUTILITY, which 
        expressed as F + UTILITY becomes that [...] which is ONE LETTER BEYOND 
        UTILITY&quot; (1980:12), the letter &quot;F&quot; symbolizing &quot;the 
        play of FREEDOM  [...] WITHIN FUNCTION&quot; (12): i.e. what supplements 
        the &quot;unction&quot; of a use-value. When Wershler-Henry in &quot;(f)Utility&quot; 
        writes inverted anagrams of the word &quot;Tool&quot; (the name of a rockband), 
        he not only evokes the ones and zeros of a binary device, but also overturns 
        any overtones of money in the capital economy of such a musical utensil 
        (i.e. <i>loto, loot, toll, </i>and <i>toto</i>) (1997a:[73]).</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Wershler-Henry confesses that, 
        in the face of such (f)utility, he already mourns the failure of his project,worrying 
        that he has done nowhere near enough to ensure that his own work can resist 
        the onslaught of sentimentality that has already diluted most critical 
        reactions to the work of bpNichol himself. Agreeing with Bill Kennedy 
        that <i>Nicholodeon</i> is just &quot;the literary equivalent of standing 
        on the edge of a cliff and commenting on how far down the bottom is&quot; 
        (1998:[2]), Wershler-Henry begins to recognize that the poet must not 
        build a bridge across a chasm so much as torch all bridges, the better 
        to leap into every chasm.</span></p>
      <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Rather than redeem the death 
        of bpNichol, turning the radical absence of such an adored figure into 
        a &quot;meaningful experience,&quot; no different from a posthumous brand 
        of consumable grief, Wershler-Henry refutes the elegiac impulse altogether 
        in order to write poems whose density and opacity allude to the meaninglessness 
        of the dead. As Derrida remarks, &quot;[t]rue 'mourning' seems to dictate 
        only a tendency: the tendency to accept incomprehension, to leave a place 
        for it, and to enumerate coldly, almost like death itself, [the] modes 
        of language which, in short, deny the whole rhetoricity of the true&quot; 
        (1989:31).</span></p>
      <p><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'>Nicholodeon</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:black'> presents itself as the cinematic variation 
        of a necronomicon--a Book of the Dead, whose &quot;lowerglyphs&quot; strive 
        to debase the great icons of literary necrosis. Unable to absorb the 'pataphysical 
        dispositions of bpNichol (his concrete poetry, his probable systems, etc.), 
        Canadian literati have ignored such work in order to radicalize the kind 
        of poetry that, by virtue of its romantic humanism, is already recognizably 
        &quot;poetic.&quot; Fork over a nickel. Gaze into the zoetrope, not for 
        the sake of &quot;Zion or Eden&quot; (1997a:[66]), but for the zeal of 
        evil. No more apostles, no more exegetes: be a heretic, be an infidel.</span></p>
