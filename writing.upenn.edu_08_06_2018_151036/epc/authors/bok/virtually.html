      <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Times'>Plastic 
        is the silly putty, with which we simulate, then supplant, every facet 
        of reality, converting all the varied elements of the planet into one 
        common emulsion. While we sleep, our automatons toil throughout the night, 
        transmuting everything into a petroleum byproduct that resists bacterial 
        predation. Our species might openly mourn this phase of our demise, but 
        in secret, we really exalt the power of its genius, marvelling to think 
        that, in some landfill of the future, long after our own extinction, a 
        single crash-helmet might still endure, sloughed off, like the carapace 
        of some alien crab. Our gewgaws of epoxy resin and nylon fibre do not 
        attest, however, to any advance in our rational prowess, so much as they 
        allude to the breadth of our cultural tyranny. The invention of plastic 
        has given birth to a celluloid spectacle, whose reveries displace the 
        esemplastic imagination of the romantics, filling our hollow skulls with 
        an injection-moulded mentality, as pliable and as durable as any blob 
        of polypropylene. Has not language itself begun to absorb the synthetic 
        qualities of such a modern milieu, becoming a fabricated, but disposable, 
        convenience, no less pollutant than a styrofoam container? Has not the 
        act of writing simply become another chemically engineered experience, 
        in which we manufacture a complex polymer by stringing together syllables 
        instead of molecules? The words of our lexicon have become so standardized 
        that they now resemble a limited array of connectible parts (much like 
        a few Lego bricks, being conjoined); and the rules of our grammar have 
        become so rationalized that they now resemble a bounded range of recombinant 
        modes (much like a new Rubik cube, being convolved). The protean quality 
        of our discourse finds itself vulcanized in our playthings. We see language 
        marketed as an infantile commodity -- a toy suitable for kids of all ages, 
        because its plastic coating makes it safe to own and easy to use; nevertheless, 
        we must imagine a more corrosive poetics (something vitriolic enough to 
        dissolve such an acrylic veneer), and if we cannot distill this kind of 
        acid, then let us concoct a more explosive poetics (something catalytic 
        enough to detonate such an acetate finish). We need a lingual variety 
        of gelignite or plastique -- the kind of incendiary literature, written 
        only by misfits, who have grown up, still dizzy from the fumes, after 
        having melted a platoon of plastic armymen with a match.</span></p>
