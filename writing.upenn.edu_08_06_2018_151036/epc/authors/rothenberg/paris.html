1<br>
into my own dark sunday light aproaches like the moon through feathers
that's no sooner seen than sunk by blindness & the thought that
everyone is dead around a city that's about to vanish as it has before
sucked down an empty pocket oversized & with a smell of earth the
bright adventurers of 1910 whose streets these were sharing a common
grave with those who followed reaching even to the place where you and
I are waiting with the friends who drop out one by one like
cybermonkeys flying into mindless space<br>
<br>
2<br>
above a gorge we hung<br>
& swayed<br>
the mountains were alive to every side<br>
stone witnesses<br>
the air was still with only a distant puff of wind<br>
we sat suspended by an iron wire<br>
voiceless<br>
no one to talk to in the world<br>
but you & me<br>
a silence between earth & sky<br>
that revelation<br>
I think I prize its emptiness the most<br>
so even now arrived in paris<br>
I sit alone<br>
& feel it bursting from my chest<br>
electric <br>
final<br>
rush of footsteps down an empty street<br>
<br>
3<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">why does a well-dressed man come up to me & ask
me for a handout?<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">(this is a dream, I think, it can't be real)<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">why does a smiling mother dressed for church
reach out a hand to touch me shadows all around her sitting on the
ground<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">why does she ask for help<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">& why do I keep walking walking past her<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">where there is no street or sun<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">even in paris on this hottest day in summer<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">what is the sound that comes at us around a
corner sound of a wave suspended in the air of hives of bees of hands
applauding in the dark<br>
<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">who is the man who wears a flower in his ear a
shirt with many folds a vest a beard the buttons glowing like electric
sparks<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">the more I search his features I can see his
lips are gone his tongue is heavy hanging to one side & forming words
that never reach me that the darkness covers<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">all the people on this street sit flat against a
wall some open-eyed some sunk in a deep sleep<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">all are dressed up <br>
<img src="blank5.gif">the men wear business suits & blazers a cardogan
a double breasted jacket a tuxedo tie & tails but have no coats or
hats<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">their shoes are simple always a dark brown or
black with marks of sand from garden walks in paris laces open
sometimes without socks<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">& the women well dressed too although the hair
of one is hanging limply with another's there are open spots that show
her skull a third one has the traces of a beard a large wet stain
under one armpit<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">just look at them & they begin to talk<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">the way that birds talk<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">feathers that the wind is blowing swirl across
the square<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">we sit in paradise & pass a ball between us<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">papers at our feet<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">then when it's time to leave we walk around a
corner climb the little flight of stairs & hear them following<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">the rush of music from a distant time a woman's
voice becoming regular the words emerging low & high relentless
openings processions<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">& it's picasso in the lead a little man with
hairy shoulders he has stripped down to his running shorts like frank
o'hara both of them now stars for minneola prep both now declare their
love of evil<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">with apollinaire here too his head no bigger
than a thumbnail flanked by gertrude stein eyes like a crazy doll's &
someone looking like my father max jacob wrapped in a monk's  brown
cloak down which his body disappears<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">here in a world where there are only little
people phantoms where the sky is not a sky the earth is shrinking
daily under silver plastic disappearing slipping through my hands like
balls in a pachinko parlor eyes revolving like red lights<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">to end here in la ripublique with all the other
dead the hungry ghosts under our windows a soup kitchen for the dead
the ones who run the ones who squat now on the grass<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">they speak our frailty the doom built into life
decomposition chaos anarchy confusion worse confounded helter skelter
squalor<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">out of whack & out of order out of kilter out of
money out of time & out of place & out of breath & out of work & out
of hope & out of power<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">because the men who come to us though dead are
just like us & stare at us like fallen princes<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">we welcome you to death they say their looks
dividing us in two<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">the numbers dance again behind our eyes<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">the circles break<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">the man holding a clock up to his ear will count
the silence<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">every day is summer<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">what was once alive is gone<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">& what has yet to be alive<br>
<img src="blank5.gif">is also gone<br>
