<P>POSTFACE TO <I>A BOOK OF WITNESS</P></B></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>A Book of Witness</I> was my passage from one century – one millennium – to 
another. The first fifty poems were written in 1999, the second fifty in the two 
years that followed. When I came into the street that first day in the year 
2000, it was one of those bright California mornings, &amp; I was struck, very 
forcefully, by the curious name of the year &amp; by a feeling that I was 
entering another world. While I didn’t put much stock in that kind of 
era-shifting, my mind that morning still held an image from something I had seen 
on television the night before – a series of movie clips showing earlier 
twentieth-century views of what the coming century would be like. <I>Millennium 
</I>was a word I had been mulling over in that closing decade, most notably in 
the assemblage <I>Poems for the Millennium</I> that Pierre Joris &amp; I put 
together &amp; published in the later 1990s. The word itself, we knew, was 
slippery – associated as it was with a sense of apocalypse &amp; destruction 
that often belied our rosier interpretations.</P>
<P></P><I>
<P>Witness</I> was another word we held in common. In its twentieth-century 
usage it had a meaning – pathetic but real – that spoke to the horrors, great 
&amp; small, that marked that time &amp; that persist today. I had come to think 
of poetry, not always but at its most revealing, as an act of witnessing, even 
of prophecy – by the poet directly or with the poet as a conduit for others. I 
had also been struck by how crucial to all of that the voice was; I mean the 
voice in the grammatical sense, the "first person" centered in the pronoun "I." 
I was aware, even so, of how that first person voice had either been debased or 
more frequently despised by many poets – often (where despised) by poets close 
to me. The intention, understandably enough, was to free the poem from its lyric 
shackles – "the lyrical interference of the individual as ego," as Olson called 
it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The loss of such expression, however, would be immense, &amp; its elimination 
futile. For there are a number of ways in which that voice – first person – has 
been one of our great resources in poetry, something that turns up everywhere in 
our deepest past &amp; present. I mean here a first person that isn’t restricted 
to the usual "confessional" attitude but is the instrument – in language – for 
all acts of witnessing, the key with which we open up to voices other than our 
own. I am thinking here of someone like the Mazatec shamness María Sabina (&amp; 
her echo in the work of our own Anne Waldman), who throws up a barrage of "I" 
assertions, when it’s really the voices of the gods, the "saint children" of her 
pantheon, whom she feels speaking through her.</P>
<P>There is in all of this a question of inventing &amp; reinventing identity, 
of experimenting with the ways in which we can speak or write as "I." In the 
course of putting that identity into question, I have brought in statements now 
&amp; again by other poets – very lightly sometimes but as a further way of 
playing down the merely ego side of "I." And I let the voices that I draw in 
shift &amp; move around. I want to do that, to keep it in suspense. "I am I 
because my little dog knows me," Gertrude Stein wrote in a poem she called 
"Identity." I have written a hundred of these poems now – a century of poems – 
&amp; I hope that they’re both of this time &amp; still connected to the oldest 
ways in which the poem makes itself.</P></FONT>
