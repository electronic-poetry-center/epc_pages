    <td>Jerome Rothenberg is the author of over seventy books of poetry including 
      <i>Poems for the Game of Silence</i>, <i>Poland/1931</i>, <i>A Seneca Journal</i>, 
      <i>Vienna Blood</i>, <i>That Dada Strain</i>, <i>New Selected Poems 1970-1985</i>, 
      <i>Khurbn</i>, and most recently, <i>A Paradise of Poets</i> and <i>A Book 
      of Witness</i> (all from New Directions). Describing his poetry career as 
      &quot;an ongoing attempt to reinterpret the poetic past from the point of 
      view of the present,&quot; he has also edited seven major assemblages of 
      traditional and contemporary poetry: <i>Technicians of the Sacred</i> (tribal 
      and oral poetry from Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania), <i>Shaking 
      the Pumpkin</i> (traditional American Indian poetry), <i>America a Prophecy</i> 
      (a radical revision of the poetries of the North American continent co-edited 
      with George Quasha), <i>Revolution of the Word</i> (American experimental 
      poetry between the two world wars), <i>A Big Jewish Book</i> (subtitled 
      &quot;Poems &amp; Other Visions of the Jews from Tribal Times to the Present&quot;), 
      and <i>Poems for the Millennium</i> (two volumes, co-edited with Pierre 
      Joris). He has also been involved, since the late 1950s, with various aspects 
      of poetry performance, including two radio soundplays written and performed 
      for Westdeuttscher Rundfunk (Cologne), the last of which (&quot;That Dada 
      Strain&quot; / &quot;Der Dada Ton&quot;) was staged in 1985 and 1987 in 
      collaboration with bassist Bertram Turetzky and director Luke Theodore Morrison 
      in California and New York. A theatrical version of his book, <i>Poland/1931</i>, 
      by Hanon Reznikov and the Living Theater, appeared on the NewYork stage 
      in April 1988, and a version of <i>Khurbn</i> (in collaboration with composer 
      Charlie Morrow and Japanese novelist Makoto Oda) was produced by the Bread 
      &amp; Puppet Theater in 1995. Rothenberg was the editor/publisher of Hawk's 
      Well Press in the early 1960s and of four poetry magazines since then: <i>Poems 
      from the Floating World</i>, <i>some/thing</i> (with David Antin), <i>Alcheringa: 
      Ethnopoetics</i> (&quot;a first magazine of the world's tribal poetries&quot;), 
      and <i>New Wilderness Letter</i> (a magazine of poetics across the spectrum 
      of the arts). In 1968 he received a Wenner-Gren Foundation grant-in-aid 
      for the experimental translation of American Indian poetry, and he has also 
      been an active translator from German, with works including <i>New Young 
      German Poets</i> (City Lights, 1959), the Broadway version of Rolf Hochhuth's 
      play &quot;The Deputy&quot; (1964), and books of poetry by Eugen Gomringer, 
      Hans Magnus Enzensberger, and Kurt Schwitters. His own selected poetry, 
      <i>Poems for the Game of Silence</i>, has appeared in French, Swedish and 
      Flemish editions, and he has been translated extensively into French, Spanish, 
      German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Serbian, Polish, Japanese, Lithuanian, 
      Chinese, and Finnish. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1974 and a 
      National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1976, was a University of California 
      Regents Professor in 1971 and a Visiting Research Professor with the Center 
      for Twentieth-Century Studies (University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee), where 
      he helped to organize &quot;the first international symposium on ethnopoetics&quot; 
      in 1975. From 1972 to 1974 he lived at the Allegany Seneca Reservation in 
      western New York State, and from 1976 to 1986 he taught extensively at the 
      University of California, San Diego. During that time he also held other 
      visiting professorships, including the Distinguished Aerol Arnold Chair 
      in Literature at the University of Southern California, and in 1986 he was 
      appointed as the visiting New York State Writer in Residence of the New 
      York State Writers Institute in Albany. From 1986 to 1988 he had a tenured 
      appointment with the State University of New York in Binghamton, and since 
      1989 he has been a professor of visual arts and literature at the University 
      of California, San Diego. Jerome Rothenberg's first collection of writings 
      on poetics, <i>Pre-Faces</i> (New Directions, 1982), received the American 
      Book Award in 1982. <i>Symposium of the Whole</i>, an anthology of writings 
      on ethnopoetics co-edited with Diane Rothenberg, was published by the University 
      of California Press in 1983, and new editions of <i>Technicians of the Sacred</i> 
      (University of California Press), <i>Shaking the Pumpkin</i> (University 
      of New Mexico Press), and <i>Revolution of the Word</i> (Exact Change) appeared 
      in 1985, 1986, and 1998. A condensed version of <i>A Big Jewish Book</i> 
      (entitled <i>Exiled in the Word</i>) is in print from Copper Canyon Press, 
      and his full translation of Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca's previously untranslated 
      <i>Suites</i> was published as part of Lorca's <i>Collected Poems</i> by 
      Farrar Straus Giroux, with separate publication scheduled by Sun &amp; Moon 
      Press for 2001. <i>PPPPPP</i> (Poems Performance Pieces Proses Plays Poetics), 
      a selection of the poetry and poetics of Kurt Schwitters, co-edited and 
      translated with Pierre Joris, appeared in 1993 from Temple University Press, 
      and will be reprinted shortly by Exact Change. The two volumes of the Rothenberg-Joris 
      anthology, <i>Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book 
      of Modern &amp; Postmodern Poetry</i>, appeared in 1995 and 1998, and recent 
      books of his own poetry include <i>Gematria</i> from Sun &amp; Moon Press, 
      <i>An Oracle for Delfi</i> from Membrane Press / Light &amp; Dust Books, 
      <i>Pictures of the Crucifixion</i> from Granary Books, and <i>A Paradise 
      of Poets</i> (1999) from New Directions. A collection of writings by various 
      hands, <i>The Book, Spiritual Instrument</i>, co-edited with David Guss, 
      was also published by Granary Books in 1996, and a larger anthology, <i>A 
      Book of the Book</i>, co-edited with Steven Clay, has recently appeared 
      from the same publisher. In 1994 Rothenberg was the winner of the PEN Oakland 
      Josephine Miles Literary Award for The Lorca Variations (poems) and the 
      PEN Center USA West Translation Award for <i>PPPPPP</i>. A second Josephine 
      Miles Award was given in 1996 for Poems for the Millennium, and in 1997 
      he received a Doctorate of Letters from the State University of New York. 
      In 1999 and again in 2001 he was a co-organizer of the People&#8217;s Poetry 
      Gathering, a three-day festival, under joint sponsorship by City Lore and 
      Poet&#8217;s House in New York City. His translation of the Czech modernist 
      Viteszlav Nezval (with co-translator Milos Sovak) appeared as <i>Antilyrik 
      &amp; Other Poems</i> from Sun &amp; Moon Press (Green Integer) in 2000, 
      for which he received a second PEN Center USA West Translation Award in 
      2002, and Green Integer also published his translation of Garc&iacute;a 
      Lorca&#8217;s <i>Suites</i> in that same year. A selection of his later 
      poems, <i>A Cruel Nirvana</i>, appeared in a Spanish translation in 2001 
      and in French in 2002, and a volume of new poems, <i>Un livre de t&eacute;moignage</i>, 
      was published in a French edition in 2002. <i>A Book of Witness</i> (new 
      poems, from New Directions), <i>A Book of Concealments</i> (new poems, from 
      Chax Press), and <i>Mar&iacute;a Sabina</i> (selections, with commentaries, 
      from University of California Press) appeared in 2003, and titles scheduled 
      for 2004 include <i>Writing Through: Selected Translations and Variations</i> 
      (Wesleyan University Press), <i>25 Caprichos, after Goya</i> (Kadle Books, 
      Tenerife), and Picasso&#8217;s <i>The Burial of the Count of Orgaz &amp; 
      Other Poems</i> (Exact Change), also with Pierre Joris. He was elected to 
      the World Academy of Poetry (UNESCO) in 2001.</td>

    <td><hr> <p><b>The following are some comments on his work</b></p>
      <p> &quot;Jerome Rothenberg is one of the truly contemporary American poets 
        who has returned U.S. poetry to the mainstream of international modern 
        literature. At the same time he is a true auctochthon. Only here and now 
        could have produced him -- a swinging orgy of Martin Buber, Marcel Duchamp, 
        Gertrude Stein, and Sitting Bull. No one writing poetry today has dug 
        deeper into the roots of poetry.&quot;</p></td>

    <td>&quot;I will always like best poets like Ginsberg and Rothenberg who write 
      about serious, passionate, often doleful concerns. . . . Yes, I like best 
      the poetry which has historical and archetypal themes, which can be described 
      as representing a culture and which tries to present, through a prescribed 
      set of imagery and stylized vocabulary, a whole mode of perception. This 
      is Jerome Rothenberg.&quot; </td>

    <td>&quot;Rothenberg's creative and mediating work with archaic and primitive 
      poetries has helped to define a changing weather, a climate in which a transnational 
      poetry becomes possible, anchored consistently in the matrix of his sense 
      of the vivid language of mid-century America . . . [and] of what Cassirer 
      called 'the consanguinity of all living things' as perceived and experienced 
      in older cultures. . . . He has been a central and fructifying presence 
      in the spirit of American poetry.&quot; </td>

    <td>&quot;Mr. Rothenberg's aim--as is evident in his extraordinary work in 
      ethnopoetics and in the anthologies he has edited . . .--is that of rediscovering 
      the 'archaic' worlds of myth, vision and revelation, all the while connecting 
      these worlds of mostly oral tradition to the poetic 'revolution of the word' 
      epitomized by writers such as Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein and Charles Olson.&quot;</td>

    <td>&quot;Jerome Rothenberg is an exception to the general misuse of Native 
      America. His book, A Seneca Journal, misses the quality of voyeurism that 
      too often characterizes poetic attempts at Indianismo, and becomes a record 
      of the meaning of life within the American land. . . . This is an example 
      of the kind of borrowing that is possible: one that allows the dignity of 
      giver and taker to remain not only undisturbed, but celebrated, illuminated, 
      made clear. Because Jerome Rothenberg understands his own origins, because 
      he knows his fathers and how his being arises of/from theirs, he can accept 
      and articulate his Seneca experience justly.&quot;</td>

      With what a humanizing redemptive gusto, once our animal spirits are brought
