<b><font size=5>14 STATIONS</font></b><p>
<dd>					for Arie Galles
<p>
The full series of fourteen poems was written to accompany Arie 
Galles's monumental charcoal drawings derived from World War II 
aerial views of the principal Nazi extermination camps -- each with 
an attendant railroad station -- known even then to have been the 
sites of holocaust.  As Galles worked from documentary 
photographs to establish some pretense at distance (= objectivity), I 
decided to objectify by turning again to gematria (traditional 
Hebrew numerology) as a way to determine the words and phrases 
that would come into the poems.  The counts were made off the 
Hebrew and/or Yiddish spellings of the camp names, then keyed to 
the numerical values of words and word combinations in the first 
five books of the Hebrew Bible.  It is my hope that this small 
degree of objective chance will not so much mask feeling or 
meaning as allow it to emerge.

THE FIRST STATION: AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU<br>
<br>
now the serpent:<br>
<br>
I will bring back<br>
their taskmasters<br>
crazy & <br>
<br>
will meet them<br>
deep in the valley<br>
& be subdued<br>
<br>
separated in life<br>
uncircumcised, needy<br>
shoes stowed away<br>
<br>
how naked they come<br>
my fathers<br>
my fathers<br>
<br>
angry & trembling,<br>
the serpents<br>
you have destroyed<br>
<br>
<br>
their faces remembered<br>
small in your eyes,<br>
shut down, soiled<br>
<br>
see a light<br>
take shape in the pit,<br>
someone killed<br>
<br>
torn in pieces<br>
a terror, a god,<br>
go down deeper<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="2"></a>
THE SECOND STATION: BABI YAR<br>
<br>
he was angry<br>
& smelled<br>
like the righteous<br>
<br>
slew<br>
the clean & pure,<br>
ran over them<br>
<br>
& they went down<br>
before us<br>
faint<br>
<br>
& streaked,<br>
the bars<br>
along the way<br>
<br>
increased & multiplied<br>
before our eyes<br>
their place<br>
<br>
spread far & wide,<br>
was like my spirit<br>
& my sword<br>
<br>
that made you see<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="3"></a>
THE THIRD STATION: BUCHENWALD<br>
<br>
<br>
deliver me<br>
from them<br>

your cattle<br>

your assembly<br>
lords of fat<br>
<br>
deliver me<br>
from color<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="4"></a>
THE FOURTH STATION: BELZEC<br>
<br>
<br>
of those who had escaped,<br>
the children foremost,<br>
he would take some as witnesses<br>
<br>
"leave me to drink<br>
"among the goats<br>
"that you may eat & I be eaten<br>
<br>
"when life becomes a terror<br>
"your strength against the children<br>
"& her children blotted out<br>

THE FIFTH STATION: BERGEN-BELSEN<br>
<br>
1<br>
gates<br>
round about me<br>
<br>
I knew<br>
& you know<br>
<br>
& she had compassion<br>
(alive)<br>
<br>
a carcass<br>
a carcass<br>
<br>
& a dancing<br>
carcass<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2<br>
& I will kill<br>
the fat<br>
& the fat ones<br>
<br>
<br>
the wicked<br>
the he-goats<br>
your mistress<br>
<br>
conceived<br>
like a coat<br>
& torn off<br>
<br>
like the twenty<br>
those you ran over<br>
& numbered<br>
<br>
& like those<br>
I will kill<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="6"></a>
THE SIXTH STATION: GROSS-ROSEN<br>
<br>
<br>
& naked there among<br>
the swarming things<br>
<br>
we saw them<br>
in the dung<br>
<br>
bright spots<br>
bright spots<br>
<br>
that she did stare at<br>
& would see them burn<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="7"></a>
THE SEVENTH STATION: DACHAU<br>
<br>
<br>
heart<br>
dim<br>
& sore<br>
<br>
his hands<br>

& heavy<br>
<br>
& so he looked,<br>
his glory<br>
weeping<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="8"></a>
THE EIGHTH STATION: CHELMNO<br>
<br>
1<br>
A Chorus of Children:<br>
<br>
we dreamed<br>
& he changed:<br>
an armed man<br>
but delicate,<br>
driven,<br>
someone who touches us,<br>
touches<br>
our thighs,<br>
strips us naked,<br>
to wound us,<br>
a fugitive,<br>
evil,<br>
aggrieved,<br>
who punishes,<br>
slays us<br>
at evening<br>
<br>
<br>
2<br>
A Chorus of Survivors<br>
<br>
the word<br>
that you feared<br>
like hail<br>
on the mountain<br>
& feared<br>
what would cause it to shine,<br>
to be seen,<br>
like her belly,<br>
like hooks,<br>
like the wheat<br>
on our altars,<br>
all will be eaten,<br>
will not be<br>
a sacrifice<br>
there with the nations,<br>
but a curse<br>
in her womb<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="9"></a>
THE NINTH STATION: TREBLINKA<br>
<br>
<br>
the voices, thunders<br>
& the voices<br>
of our kin<br>
that they will bring in<br>
from the top<br>
<br>
the kingdoms gathering<br>
to kill us<br>
& you will wave<br>
o Israel<br>
& will submit yourself<br>
<br>
& I will set apart<br>
the sum of them<br>
the thunders, voices<br>
& the thunders<br>
I will watch & will take heed<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="10"></a>
THE TENTH STATION: MAUTHAUSEN<br>
<br>
<br>
your camp<br>
brings me<br>
the war<br>
that bore you,<br>
<br>
made you inherit<br>
the plague,<br>
your children<br>
torn from you,<br>
<br>
your hands that spawned<br>
the offspring of<br>
the nations,<br>
a stone against them<br>
<br>
from my hand,<br>
my hand against them<br>
& a plague<br>
between us<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="11"></a>
THE ELEVENTH STATION: MAIDANEK<br>
<br>
<br>
1<br>
a thing<br>
spoken<br>
speaks in me<br>
<br>
I see<br>
the spoken<br>
thing<br>
<br>
a word<br>
hail<br>
pestilence<br>
<br>
& from your face<br>
a curse<br>
is poured out<br>
<br>
& a bone<br>
is set in motion<br>
spoken<br>
<br>
in disgust<br>
to see<br>
the one who speaks it<br>
<br>
2<br>
a foreigner,<br>
you say,<br>
the dew like blood<br>
<br>
her city<br>
broken<br>
empty for her sake<br>
<br>
has blessed you,<br>
seed of them<br>
I will pursue<br>
<br>
& you will say<br>
in blood:<br>
leave me alone<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="12"></a>
THE TWELFTH STATION: SOBIBOR<br>
<br>
<br>
1<br>
<br>
as he had spoken<br>
from the wilderness:<br>
be fruitful!<br>
<br>
(& they were fruitful)<br>
<br>
so he could blind them<br>
with a fist<br>
& cut them --<br>
<br>
& she could take from them<br>
the vision of<br>
his cities<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2<br>
<br>
a skin<br>
harp<br>
& a boil<br>
<br>
according to its words<br>
<br>
how blind<br>
& evil<br>
like its skin<br>
<br>
your words<br>
erased<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="13"></a>
THE THIRTEENTH STATION: RAVENSBRUCK<br>
<br>
1<br>
in my name she placed<br>
an offering of dust<br>
<br>
an offering of graves<br>
where she lay empty<br>
<br>
desolate, lay guilty<br>
for her pleasures<br>
<br>
in my name, the lamb<br>
approaching<br>
<br>
placed the basin<br>
at her neck<br>
<br>
throughout your generations<br>
<br>  
<br>
2<br>
For Rachel, twice:<br>
<br>
she turned aside,<br>
I thought,<br>
the wood, the thorns<br>
wounding my thighs<br>
<br>
<br>
& when they came<br>
& carried her away<br>
he gave them numbers<br>
by the sword<br>
<br>
a bell<br>
for those with numbers<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="14"></a>
THE FOURTEENTH STATION: STUTTHOF<br>
<br>
<br>
the evil water<br>
in my dream<br>
<br>
has emptied out<br>
their cities<br>
<br>
like my mouth<br>
a hole<br>
<br>
& in the blood<br>
they burn<br>
<br>
they turn them<br>
into smoke<br>
