<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A quarter of a century has gone by, &amp; where
we felt ourselves  then to be still tightly  if dangerously within the
twentieth  century &amp;  (thereby)  the old  millennium,  we are  now
rushing into new, uncharted,  sometimes heady, often terrifying waters
of the century &amp; the millennium  to come.  It is curious, to watch
your own life run out along  with the time, the century that made you.
For by 2001 I will be at my allotted biblical age - the time-to-die as
specified in Ecclesiastes  - unless (soul clap its  hands &amp; sing!)
reprieve is  given for  another decade, maybe  two at  utmost<I>.  But
millennium  is  magic time,  we  like  to  think, &amp;  anything  can
happen.</I> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  would like to talk  to you &amp;  to end the
talk by reading/performing some poems  (none of them my own &amp; some
of them very far from <I>modern</I>) that seem (as poems sometimes do)
(the traditional  ones at least) to  defy time &amp;  to promise their
transition (if not - again - our own) from this century into the next.
They came to light  for us in the twentieth century -  at the heart of
modernism, which welcomed them as  a part of itself while knowing that
they were  truly, inescapably  from elsewhere.  This  was in  fact the
dynamic  of <I>ethnopoetics</I>, as  some of  us came  to speak  of it
during  the  second   great  wave  of  experimental  twentieth-century
modernism from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> For me such an ethnopoetics - which looks away
from the modern &amp; experimental, to focus on ancient &amp;
autochthonous cultures (often under threat of mass extinction or long
since blown away) - is the product (as study &amp; praxis) of our most
dedicated &amp; outrageous modernism, even surviving (under fire) into
that <I>post</I>modernism taken as the older movement's <I>early</I>
&amp; forever problematic offspring.  <I>Early</I>, I say, remembering
that it was Tristan Tzara - founder of Dada as a high point
[culmination] of that first wave of experimental modernism that
Marjorie Perloff called "the futurist moment" - who in his Weimar
manifesto-lecture of 1922 declared: "You are mistaken if you take Dada
for a modern school, or as a reaction against the schools of
today. ... Dada is not at all modern.  It is more in the nature of an
almost Buddhist religion of indifference."  (Armand Schwerner would
know far more about the Buddhism than I would - or than Tzara for that
matter.  For Tzara, who compiled an early - if unpublished - anthology
of tribal/oral poetry from Africa &amp; Oceania, [for Tzara] the
common roots of poetry &amp; spirit/mind [in French the single word
<I>esprit</I> covers both English words] were clearly in cultures that
Europeans then saw as farthest from their own.  More importantly, the
reference to religion positioned what he &amp; the other Dadaists were
doing [as] outside the domain of literature as such - a matter here of
germinal importance!)  But it wasn't only Tzara who put the newness of
his own modern -ism into doubt.  Gertrude Stein, whom I've also quoted
before, said of what she &amp; her modernist companions were about:
"As it is old it is new, and as it is new it is old" ... &amp; she
added - by way of clarification &amp;/or complication: "But now we
have come to be in our own way which is a completely different
way."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point here can go off in a number of
different directions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the experimental modernists (in whatever
art) were calling the bounded categories of earlier European art &amp;
poetry into question (&amp; they <I>were</I>), it was with the
intention of opening possibilities (social &amp; spiritual as well as
aesthetic) that those boundaries had obscured or long repressed.
Their own creations - in search of the new &amp; unexpected (therefore
marvelous) - came foremost.  But as technology (transportation,
communications, media, etc.) &amp; the attendant global imperialisms
opened new/old worlds to view &amp; interchange (<I>and</I> plunder),
a revelation to the artist who was then seeking revelation was that
the definitions of the imperializing culture were - like its
accomplishments - only partial.  The suspicion came to be that certain
forms of poetry, like certain forms of artmaking, permeated
traditional societies &amp; that these largely religious forms not
only resembled but had long since <I>achieved</I> what the new
experimental poets &amp; artists were then first setting out to
do. Those forms once known - &amp; this came to be understood more
slowly for language-dependent arts like poetry - forced a
reconsideration of what the work (of art, of poetry, of language, of
performance) could be or had been in the course of human (<I>truly</I>
human) time.  Said Picasso, as if to put his turning toward the
"primitive" into other than a merely formal context: "The [African]
masks weren't just like any other pieces of sculpture.  Not at all.
They were magic things. ... [They] were <I>intercesseurs</I>,
mediators. ... They were against everything - against unknown,
threatening spirits. ... They were weapons.  To help people avoid
coming under the influence of spirits again, to help them become
independent. [The masks] are tools.  If we give spirits a form, we
become independent. ... [At that point, he concludes,] I understood
why I was a painter."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It remained for my generation of poets - in
league with many many others - to show the extent to which this might
be true ... &amp; only then to question it.  My own entry into all of
this was conditioned - clearly so - by generations of predecessors,
most of whom I did not know at the outset, some of them poets but
others anthropologists, philosophers, biologists, religious thinkers,
activist-defenders of a thousand old &amp; new ways.  The time of the
awakening - in &amp; after World War II - brought a convergence of the
need for poetry as a truth-bearing (deconstructing) language (against
what Hugo Ball had earlier called "the filth that clings to language"
[as it came down to us]) &amp; the need (also brought home by that
second [anti-fascist] war) to do away with racism &amp; a culture of
ethnic rankings, while preserving the values embedded in historic
ethnicities &amp; cultures.  The decade that followed also saw a
revival of the concern that we later came to call ecological, with an
environment - local &amp; global - under increasing developmental
pressure, &amp; the view - emerging from that concern - that just
those cultures that were repositories of the old poetries were the
models thereby for a more sane relation to the natural world &amp; its
other-than-human as well as its human inhabitants. Gradually this
would open up to a concern &amp; need for what sacred language in
traditional bioregional cultures (I here use Gary Snyder's
terminology) could still show us and (lest we forget) to a
responsibility toward such of them as remain our contemporaries in
their sometimes precarious struggle for survival.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking for - &amp; of - myself, then, I
wandered through the 1950s, then the 1960s, looking for that kind of
poetry (or language), eager not only to construct or make it but to
discover where it might have been before, where it might still exist
among us.  Somewhere along the way Armand Schwerner became my
<I>compadre </I>- one of my compadres - wherever his own search was
then taking him.  We met in 1957 or 1958, and he was one of those,
later, with whom I was in constant conversation at the time I was
assembling the works I would bring together in <I>Technicians of the
Sacred</I>.  (His own astonishing <I>Tablets </I>were already underway
in 1968, when <I>Technicians</I> was first published, &amp; I included
the second of them in the accompanying commentaries.)  Once into that
process it became clear to me that we would never know what poetry was
<I>really</I> about, what it might still be for us, until we broke
down the boundaries &amp; allowed ourselves to see &amp; to refine
upon what had already been brought out into the open.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was after <I>Technicians </I>that I came to
know both Dennis Tedlock and Simon Ortiz.  I had already introduced
the term <I>ethnopoetics</I> in the second issue of George Quasha's
magazine <I>Stony Brook</I> and had met the anthropologist &amp; poet
Stanley Diamond &amp; the ethnomusicologist David McAllister, who
would soon lead me into the most experimental translations of oral
poetry I would ever be involved in.  Through Diamond, Diane Rothenberg
and I had been brought into the sphere of the Seneca Indians in
western New York State, where I began a series of collaborative
translations with Seneca songmen Richard Johnny John and Avery
Jimerson.  I also began to realize here that the dissemination - in
any form - of [specifically American Indian] religious or sacred art -
unlike other cultural areas with which I was then familiar - was
subject to great misgivings &amp; prohibitions in the eyes of many.
(But more about that later.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was while preparing my second ethnopoetic
gathering, <I>Shaking the Pumpkin</I>, that I received a packet from
Dennis Tedlock including his translation - I would later call it his
<I>total</I> translation - of a Zuni Indian [oral] narrative called
<I>The Boy &amp; the Deer</I>.  What it had to say about the nature of
talking &amp; story-telling as those related to poetry (I mean
<I>our</I> poetry as well as <I>theirs</I>) was one of the most
electrifying experiences in my life as a poet.  It also led quickly to
our founding of <I>Alcheringa</I> as an ongoing venue (we hoped) for a
new ethnopoetics: a convergence of poets &amp; scholars toward a
re-imagining of poetry based on its actual development and presence in
the life of many different peoples &amp; cultures.  (We were also
concerned, for various reasons, with the poetries of what we were then
calling <I>fourth world peoples</I> - those, in an increasingly
<I>post</I>colonial world, who were still among the [colonially]
dispossessed.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time too I had begun to meet a number
of new American Indian poets - foremost among them Simon Ortiz of
Acoma, who gave me the clearest indication of how a traditional poetry
&amp; way of life could be meaningfully brought into the present by
someone speaking, knowingly &amp; honestly, from within his culture.
But it became clear too - not from Ortiz (who was then with us on the
<I>Alcheringa</I> masthead) but from sufficient others - that there
was a strong resistance from within those cultures to any such
searches / investigations / speculations from without.  It was this
that (for some of us at least) finally deflected the process we had
set in motion - not so much to the satisfaction of the cultural
insiders as to that of those outsiders who saw what we were doing as
an unwanted threat to western hegemonies and canons.  (All this was in
large part prior to the 1980s/90s discussions of multiculturalism
&amp; western-oriented cultural literacy, &amp; so on, &amp; dealt [I
suppose] with what would generally be perceived as smaller stakes for
the nation as a whole.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For me the basic tenets of the ethnopoetics set
forth in <I>Alcheringa</I> have never lessened.  I believe still -
after all the holocausts our time has witnessed - that poetry (&amp; I
mean by that a radical poetry of displacements &amp; inventions) - is
for us the necessary language or counter-language for the lack of
which, William Carlos Williams told us many years ago, men were
everyday dying. Therefore a poetics is for me what a personal (as
distinguished from an imposed) theology might be for a person with a
serious belief in God or a metaphysics for another kind of searcher
after what is real or true (or both - or neither).  But I swear - on
my faith as a poet - that a poetics without a concurrent
<I>ethno</I>poetics is stunted, partial, therefore faulty in a time
like ours that can only save itself by learning to confront its
multiple identities and definitions - its contradictions, therefore,
&amp; its problematics.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That, anyway, remains the central tenet for
myself as a poet moving with some hope into a new time.  And yet, as
that time unfolds, we see again the dark side of that strange force I
used to speak about as <I>ethnos</I> - the side that shows up (in
Bosnia, Rwanda, elsewhere) in a terrible conjunction with the
nation-state, erupting into ethnic violence &amp; hatred.  I would
therefore be wary - &amp; hope you will be too - of the politics of
ethnic exclusivity, to insure thereby that our ethnopoetics will not
stop with a useful but centrifugal <I>multi</I>culturalism but will
push (again) toward an <I>inter</I>cultural (centripetal) future.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><center>*  *  *  *  *  *  * </center> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of which has, I'm afraid, been said too
quickly - more as an outline of what I <I>meant</I> to say than as a
rounded or developed exploration.  In my own case - to get back to
that - a sense of our ethnopoetics has (I believe) conditioned my work
- my poetry &amp; other gatherings - up to the present.  The most
recent of my larger projects has been (in collaboration with Pierre
Joris) a two-volume global anthology of the twentieth-century
avant-garde, called (variously) <I>Poems for the Millennium</I> and
<I>The University of California Book of Modern and Postmodern
Poetry</I>.  In the first of the two volumes (<I>From
Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle to Negritude</I>), which will be appearing by
mid-1995, something like our ethnopoetics (but with old &amp; new
juxtaposed, set beside each other) is carried forward as a separate
section called <I>A Book of Origins</I>.  In closing, then, I would
like to read the prologue to that section &amp; some very abridged
versions of the entries (largely European and Euro-American) that
conclude it.</P>
