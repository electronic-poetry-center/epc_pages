<font size=5><b>TWENTIETH CENTURY UNLIMITED</b></font>
<font size=4>
<p>
as the twentieth century winds down<br>
the nineteenth begins<br>
again<br>
         <dd>   it is as if nothing happened<br>
though those who lived it thought<br>
that everything was happening<br>
enough to name a world for & a time<br>
to hold it in your hand<br>
unlimited    the last delusion<br>
like the perfect mask of death
