<hr>

<img src="../../images/nygp1.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10><font size=5>MY FIRST PUBLISHED BOOK</font> came in 1959 - on the cusp between the


1950s and the 1960s - &amp; took me (almost by surprise) into
the center 

of what had by then emerged as the New American Poetry (a year


before its being named that in the great Don Allen anthology of
1960).  

That book of mine was called New Young German Poets and was a


work of translation; the publisher was City Lights (thru Lawrence


Ferlinghetti) and the imprint was as number 11 in the Pocket Poets


Series, of which Ferlinghetti's Pictures of the Gone World was
number 

one &amp; Allen Ginsberg's Howl &amp; Other Poems was number four.
 (That 

Kenneth Rexroth's Thirty Spanish Poems of Love &amp; Exile was
number 

two and Ferlinghetti's translation of Jacques Pr&eacute;vert's
Paroles was 

number nine should also be remembered toward the narrative that


follows.)
<p>
 That decade for me - for most of us, I imagine - had started


out differently.  In 1950 I was still a student, with David Antin
&amp; 

others, in New York's City College, and it was from there that
I 

watched the war return to us in Korea, &amp; with it the early
repressions 

of the Cold War in its McCarthyite manifestations.  I had declared


myself a poet a few years before that - a kid's reaction or assertion
of 

some degree of otherness against the years of war (world war)
&amp; 

holocaust that accompanied the early childhood.  What I found
most 

thrilling - needed - at the start was the work / the language
of those 

poets who could lead me into acts of othering.  Stein came early
in that 

sense - as did Joyce &amp; Cummings; or on another level, Dal&iacute;
(in his 

writings too) and the rumored Dadaists, whose works we wouldn't


read for another year or two but who we heard had written poems
that 

did away with words.  Williams and Pound came about the same time

&amp; carried Whitman in their wake.  And we also read The Waste
Land.

 What college did - but not to me alone - was to inculcate the


sense that most of that was dead.  That was the going wisdom then,
&amp; 

largely in the name of Eliot, whom Williams called - &amp; rightly
in that 

sense - &quot;the great disaster to our letters.&quot;<a name="1"></a><b><a href="50s.html#notes">(1)</a></b>  The result
- postmodern, 

after modern in the worst sense - was to throw us into a condition
of 

what [my first poetry teacher] Delmore Schwartz then called &quot;picking


up again the meters&quot; and continuing &quot;the revolution
in poetic taste 

which was inspired by the criticism of T.S. Eliot,&quot; or elsewhere:
&quot;the 

poetic idiom and literary taste of the generation of Pound and
Eliot.&quot;  

As an example of that &quot;revolution&quot; he cited the following
from W.D. 

Snodgrass:<BR>

<blockquote>
  The green catalpa tree has turned
<br>
  All white; the cherrry blooms once more.
<br>
  In one whole year I haven't learned
<br>
  A blessed thing they pay you for<BR>

</blockquote>
- at which David Antin looked back (circa 1972) and commented:


&quot;The comparison of this updated version of A Shropshire Lad
... and 

the poetry of the Cantos and The Waste Land seems so aberrant
as to 

verge on the pathological.&quot;<a name="2"></a> <b><a href="50s.html#notes">(2)</a></b>
<P>
 It was this, then, or something roughly equivalent to this that


was being hammered home to us in our late teens &amp; early twenties,
&amp; 

it followed me in 1952 when I went to the University of Michigan
for a 

year of graduate study &amp; draft evasion, most notably in the


intelligent &quot;new criticism&quot; of Austin Warren &amp; others
that nearly spun 

my head around.  I found myself there - curiously - as a lone


defender of Walt Whitman, watching as Warren tried and failed
to cope 

with both Whitman's monumental verse lines &amp; his equally 

monumental stance-toward-reality.  Against which the principal
relief 

- along with Pound and Williams and a few of the other American


rejects we still knew (Stein &amp; Cummings certainly) - came
through 

the (largely translated) works of a number of European poets and
near-

avantgardists: Rimbaud, Lorca, Mayakovsky, Rilke, Apollinaire
[&amp; so 

on] early in the decade, others (along with other American forerunners)


as the decade swung around.  It was at Michigan too that I came
to my 

own discovery of Blake and Christopher Smart (I wrote my master's


thesis on Smart's rhyming &quot;hymns&quot; while loving most
his Jubilate 

Agno), and it was there that I discovered - in library stacks
divorced 

from literature or poetry - the poetries of Africa and the Indian


Americas that would reemerge for me well into the 1960s.
<P>
 What I was unaware of - what we were unaware of where I 

roamed - was the widespread unrest within our generation &amp;
the 

ways in which the turnaround was getting under way - both in the


States &amp; elsewhere.  My own way then went through two years
in the 

army - most of it spent in (dreaded) Germany - &amp; a return
to New 

York &amp; a company of friends (Antin, Kelly, Schwerner, others
by the 

later 1950s), with whom it was possible to shape a mutual deliverance.
 

The breakthrough, when it came, was a return at first to the ideas
of 

poetry that the early years had nearly driven out of us.  For
me this had 

the sense of a renaissance, the rebirth or reawakening of a radical


modernism that was not only rooted in the U.S. (out of Whitman)
but 

had gone still further elsewhere - into shapes &amp; forms (of
mind as 

well as measure) that were the starters for a work that we would
carry 

forward.
<P>
 What finally brought me over the edge - along with the sense


of an ever increasing company of poets &amp; others in a circle-of-

companions - was the work on New Young German Poets.  (I had 

also, with Robert Kelly chiefly, coined the term &amp; elaborated
the 

practice of  &quot;deep image,&quot; a term that would later be
associated with 

the considerably different practice of Robert Bly, another companion


from that time.)  The offer from Ferlinghetti to look into the
&quot;new&quot; 

postwar German poets followed on what was in fact my first 

publication: a set of rhymed translations from the 1920s poet
and 

novelist (cabaret poet, as I made him out to be) Erich K&auml;stner,
one of 

which (for the record) ran like this:
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
The work was printed under my full name - Jerome Dennis 

Rothenberg - in the winter 1957 issue of The Hudson Review (!)
&amp; 

brought a letter shortly thereafter from Ferlinghetti, asking
if I wanted 

to take a crack at a German postwar project, about which he (like
me!) 

knew very little.  The search that followed coincided with the


reclaiming of my own work &amp; life after the actual working
on the 

K&auml;stner poems in 1955 and '56.
<P>
 New Young German Poets allowed me to be the first to publish


a number of poems by Paul Celan in English versions, as well as
the  

(probably) first English translations of poets like G&uuml;nter
Grass, Helmut 

Heissenb&uuml;ttel, Ingeborg Bachmann, and Hans Magnus Enzensberger.
 

(I also translated but didn't include two poems by Rainer Maria


Gerhardt, the young poet to whom Olson dedicated - as &quot;funeral


poem&quot; - &quot;The Death of Europe.&quot;)  In the act of
translating I came to 

discover the existence of writings - of modes of poetry - that
opened 

possibilities that were both like and different from the new poetry
&amp; 

poetics emerging in the U.S.  (That every move I made added to
my 

own resources as a writer was - how could it not be? - the still


greater bonus.)  Of the poets I then translated, Celan (early
Celan, let 

me point out) was the most overwhelming, with the more 

&quot;experimental&quot; Heissenbuttel (for me, then) almost as
important for the 

sense he gave me of new ways of form and language.  Here, because
I 

can't resist, are two examples:

<p>
[reads &quot;Shibboleth&quot; and &quot;Combination II&quot;]:
<P>
 

<img src="../../images/dada.jpg" align=right hspace=20 vspace=1"> With the postwar German poets as my particular way in, the 

1950s (as I came to them) were otherwise a time in which I got
to 

know (&amp; reassess by knowing) the work of both the earlier


experimental modernists &amp; those who were, like those I knew
at home, 

opening (to use a World War II expression) a second front for


modernism.  Robert Motherwell's Dada Painters &amp; Poets, which
had 

been there since 1951, was in its way as important for me - for
us - 

as the Allen anthology might be a few years later.<a name="3"></a> <b><a href="50s.html#notes">(3)</a></b>   So too was
the 

pervasive presence - in New York surely - of already visible and


active avant-gardes in painting and music (both jazz and &quot;new&quot;),
which 

created a viable alternative before the Beats &amp; others made
it still 

clearer in their acts of poetry.  It was with this as a backdrop
that Don 

Allen, when he came to make his statement for the &quot;new American


poetry&quot; of the 1950s,  placed it side by side as a revitalized
form of 

modernism with &quot;abstract expressionism&quot; and jazz  In
doing this he 

made what was a wonderful &amp; far-reaching assertion of a new


American hegemony in the arts, saying of it on its poetry side:
&quot;This 

anthology makes the ... claim [that] the new American poetry [is]
now 

becoming the dominant movement in the second phase of our 

twentieth-century literature and already exerting strong influence


abroad.&quot;  (That it was the Beat poets who were the leading
wedge in 

this - rather than some others we might more have favored - is
a 

point worth noting.)
<P>
 My own take on these matters was different then &amp; came to
be 

still more different over the intervening years.  While recognizing
&amp; 

participating in what was a crucial American moment, I saw what
was 

happening in American poetry as part of a larger global manifestation,


some of it (as I came to know later) occuring before or certainly
apart 

from the American influence as such.  It was for these reasons
(&amp; from 

an over-emphasis of my role as a translator) that Allen, in what
may 

have been our only correspondence at the time, pinpointed me as
a 

proponent of what he called, if I remember it correctly, the 

international style of poetry.  In this, but in a way far different
from 

how that term has since been used, I would like to think that
he was 

absolutely right.
<P>
 I am saying this, of course, with something like thirty-five
years 

of hindsight.  In the late 1950s most of what was revealing itself
to us 

from the outside was from an earlier generation that we were still
in the 

process of rediscovering.  Just as word was coming back of the
old 

&quot;Objectivists&quot; (themselves becoming active again as
makers of a 

transitional American poetry), the recovered poets from elsewhere


included the likes of Neruda and Vallejo; of Surrealist masters
like 

Breton and Artaud (disregarded by the American middle-grounders
- 

Robert Bly &amp; company included - in favor of less &quot;convulsive&quot;


practitioners like Eluard or Desnos); of Dadaists like Tzara and
Hugo 

Ball or like Kurt Schwitters, whose work was hinted at - but only


hinted at - in Motherwell; of a mysterious generation of Negritude


poets in Africa &amp; the Caribbean.  And so on.  Some of this
I shared 

with those like Paul Blackburn or the older &amp; incredibly active
Kenneth 

Rexroth (or with  Bly or Bill Merwin for all of that) as poets
devoted to 

translation while - in Blackburn's case at least - remaining rooted
in 

the sense of an American &quot;duende&quot; that spoke to us from
deep within 

the language.  And of those others I was then starting to meet,
Duncan 

was (like Rexroth or Ferlinghetti - or Ashbery &amp; O'Hara in
a rather 

different way) remarkably open to the world at large; Olson and


Snyder, say, much more nativist in their approaches both to past
&amp; 

present, though quite exemplary in leaps back into ancient worlds
- 

both east &amp; west - as far back as the paleolithic.<a name="4"></a> <b><a href="50s.html#notes">(4)</a></b>   My own
ventures, 

with Robert Kelly &amp; others, into the shadier sides of deep-image


writing (my coinage there, for worse or better) were in large
part a 

revival of what was coming at us from the recent past of Europe.
<p>
 What we knew then, much of it obscured by the anti-modernist


turn at the beginning of the decade, was imperative for us to
know.  

What we didn't know - obscured by our own breakthroughs as 

American poets [pre-Viet Nam] - was how much else was coming 

into presence then or had emerged, even in this most American
of 

centuries &amp; moments, without our blessings.  Over the last
few years 

I've had a chance - working with Pierre Joris - to go over the
terrain 

of the immediate postwar decades (1945 to 1960, the years of the
New 

American Poetry) as the opening wedge for the second volume of


Poems for the Millennium, the &quot;global&quot; anthology that's
been a central 

work of ours since 1990.  This is in some sense fired by Pierre's


nomadism, as well as my own: our sense of a community / a 

commonality of poets that both of us have known (&amp; continue
to know) 

across whatever boundaries.  Being far enough away from the fifties


now to have a wider view of the terrain, I see the &quot;new American


poetry&quot; that so much defined us as itself a part (a key part,
sure, but 

still a part) of a worldwide series of moves &amp; movements that
took the 

political, visionary, &amp; formal remnants of an earlier modernism
&amp; 

reshaped &amp; reinvented [extended] them in the only time allowed
to us 

on earth.  I believe at the same time that such a view is both
truer to the 

facts &amp; provides a richer source &amp; context for later American


postmodernisms ( that of the Language Poets, say) &amp; for aspects
of the 

experimental American '50s and '60s neglected in both earlier
&amp; later 

versions of The New American Poetry.
<p>
<A HREF="../joris/millennium.html"><img src="../../images/pfm.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10></A>

 I would like to give you, then, a sense of the configuration,
the 

reconfiguration we've attempted - both to see how the New 

American Poetry fits into that larger frame &amp; how little of
it was 

evident to us then.  The first volume - for those who haven't
seen it 

- covered a range of work &quot;from fin-de-si&egrave;cle to negritude&quot;
- from 

Mallarm&eacute;'s Coup de d&egrave;s of 1897 to work appearing
in the midst of 

World War II.  The division was into three &quot;galleries&quot;
of individual 

poets &amp; six sections devoted to the movements that typified
the time 

but have been deliberately omitted or reduced to footnotes in
most 

other gatherings of poetry.  (These were, in order, Futurism [both


Russian &amp; Italian], Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism, the 

&quot;Objectivists,&quot; &amp; Negritude.)  In doing this we
were not being original 

(or even &quot;ornery&quot; in some sense) but asserting what
for many of us was 

the actual configuration of that time.  We were also setting the
stage for 

the second volume - the present world in which we live &amp; work.
<P>
 With that second volume - from World War II to the present 

[&amp; beyond] - there is no completion &amp; the omissions &amp;
gaps are 

overwhelming.  Having said that, I would like to go over the disposition


of the contents - some portion of them - to give a view of American


poetry &amp; poets interspersed with sometimes equally experimental,


sometimes more experimental poets from elsewhere.  (For this reason,


with America as the point of departure, the amount of U.S. poetry
is &amp; 

remains disproportionate.)  Over all, the question of inclusion
&amp; 

exclusion, which can never be properly resolved, was less important


with regard to individuals &amp; movements - more with regard
to the 

possibilities of poetry now being opened.  There are two galleries
this 

time around, the first &amp; earlier consisting largely of poets
who were or 

became active during the 1940s and 1950s - the subject in short
of 

this gathering.  And within these we've imbedded a number of 

groupings - somewhat like the movements of the previous volume,


but often more localized or more restricted to moves in poetry
rather 

than across the arts (although that poetry may itself show real


amalgams with the plastic arts or music).  After I give you a
sense of 

what the juxtapositions here feel like, I'll end it with a reading
from 

those clusters or mini-movements, which are contemporaneous with


the New American Poetry or, in several instances, come before
it.  The 

point is not to trace influences from group to group or poet to
poet 

(largely absent till the later 1950s/early 1960s) but to set out
a range of 

responses to the postwar (cold war) era and the wars &amp; holocausts
that 

lay behind it.
<P>
 The first gallery, then, consists of work from some fifty poets


- from Marie Luise Kaschnitz born in 1901 to Gary Snyder born
in 

1930.  It follows a section of poems by some of the poets who


appeared in the earlier volume but whose postwar poetry - often


&quot;maximal&quot; as Olson would have had it) showed a continuity
between 

the century's two halves; namely Stein, Stevens, Joyce, Williams,


Pound, H.D., MacDiarmid, Breton, Michaux, Zukofsky, Neruda, 

Ekel&ouml;f, Rukeyser, C&eacute;saire.  (You will note already
the gaps &amp; 

omissions that any of us could point to.)  But it's in the contents
of the 

first gallery as such that the richness of the time begins to
show itself 

- a richness measured in fact by its unboundedness.  In sequence,


then, the first twenty to appear run like this: Marie Luise Kaschnitz,


Vladimir Holan, Samuel Beckett, George Oppen, Yannis Ritsos, 

Charles Olson, Edmond Jab&egrave;s, John Cage, Octavio Paz, Bert


Schierbeck, Robert Duncan, Yoshioku Minoru, Paul Celan, 

Mohammed Dib, Amos Tutuola, Helmut Heissenb&uuml;ttel, Jackson
Mac 

Low, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Vasko Popa, &amp; Denise Levertov.<a name="5"></a> <b><a href="50s.html#notes">(5)</a></b>
 It is a 

configuration of contemporaries - ours - &amp; of possibilities
- ours 

also - with regard to which the vaunted American dominance (forty


years later) seems a wild exaggeration.  That we may feel a kinship
(&amp; 

sometimes open friendship) with all those named is a further point


worth making.
<P>
 Along with poets such as these - &amp; there were, clearly, many


more - groupings had begun to appear with some resemblance to
the 

pre-war movements.  Some were confined to a single place &amp;
language 

or to a set of places, others (the exceptions) to a sweep that
cut more 

boldly than their predecesors across divides of place &amp; nation.
 Six of 

the ones we've chosen were already active in the 1950s, two as
far 

back as the later 1940s.  The thrust in all was toward a rupture
with the 

past, or a renewal of the interrupted ruptures of the pre-war
avant-

gardes, now made more urgent by the war &amp; by a sense of dangers
&amp; 

repressions still persisting.  As with those predecessors the
urgency 

went back into the poem itself (the way the poem was made) - a
point 

reiterated in those years (again, again) by William Carlos Williams.
  In 

America his rage for a new measure dominated - in Olson's sense
of 

a projective verse, in Ginsberg's citation that &quot;when the
mode of the 

music changes, the walls of the city shake.&quot;  The openings
elsewhere 

- as among American avantgardists of another stripe [Mac Low &amp;


Cage immediate examples] - took different but equally dynamic


turns.<BR>

<P>
 As particular groupings - clusters - topoi - take the 

following.

<P>
 The Wiener Gruppe [Vienna Group] kicks off in 1953, with the


founding by H[ans] C[arl] Artmann of &quot;a basement theater
in Vienna 

(die kleine schaub&uuml;hne) for 'macabre feasts, 

poetic acts', and pranks like black masses, an evening 'with illuminated


birdcages,' or one 'in memoriam to a crucified glove'.&quot; (Rosmarie


Waldrop)  Early participants in the group were Artmann, along
with 

Gerhard R&uuml;hm, Konrad Bayer, Oswald Wiener, and Friederich


Achleitner, joined in 1957 by Ernst Jandl and Friederike Mayr&ouml;cker.
 

The range of work included a renewed exploration of visual and
sound 

poetry and a high degree of vernacular language play, including
works 

in Viennese dialect, &quot;not in order to mimic speech or render
local 

color&quot; - writes Rosmarie Waldrop - &quot;but as a reservoir
of sounds 

and expressions ... that exploit the tension between the spoken


immediacy and the outlandish look of the dialect words when spelled


out on the page.&quot;  Writes h.c. artmann in his 1953 eight
point 

proclamation of the poetic act: &quot;there is a premise which
is 

unassailable, namely that one can be a poet even without ever
having 

written or spoken a single word. / however the prerequisite is
the more 

or less felt wish to act poetically.  the alogical gesture can
itself be 

performed such that it is raised to an act of outstanding beauty.
 ineed 

to poetry.  beauty is however a concept which is here allowed
a greatly 

enlarged field of play.&quot;  And then, as poem, the following
in Viennese 

dialect (translated by me into I don't know what kind of New York


thing from childhood):

<P>
[reads]:

<P>
Or this [example of &quot;new sentence,&quot; say] - in prose
from Konrad Bayer:

<P>
[reads &quot;The White and the Black Bones&quot;]:

<P>
 A second grouping, the self-proclaimed &quot;Tammuzi poets,&quot;


consisted of writers from Lebanon and Syria, who in 1956 came


together around the Beirut magazine Shi'r [Poetry] - one of the
key 

instances, in the two decades following World War II, of third-world


liberation movements with their well-known cultural/political


concommitants: the simultaneous demands for revolution &amp; tradition.
 

As poets of the Arabic language the Tammuzis not only proclaimed
a 

relation to a deep tradition (an ancient order newly rediscovered)
but 

spelled out a further struggle (a second liberation from within
the 

culture &amp; the language) to create &quot;a poetry that establishes
another 

concept of identity - one that is pluralist, open, aganostic,
and 

secular.&quot;  (Thus: the Syrian poet Adonis [born Ali Ahmed
Said] on 

&quot;poetry &amp; apoetical culture.&quot;)
<p>
 And this from the Lebanese poet Unsi al-Hajj in Pierre Joris's
English version:

<P>
[reads &quot;The Charlatan&quot;]:
<P>
 A still earlier movement - &amp; one which would have a curious


repercussion at a later time - was that of the artists &amp; poets
who came 

together, starting as early as 1948, under the coined name COBRA.
 

&quot;The choice of a name whicis not an ism, but that of an animal,&quot;
said 

poet-artist Christian Dotremont in retrospect, &amp; added: &quot;We
were in 

fact against all isms, against all that implied a system.&quot;
 The cities in 

which they worked - &amp; whose opening letters formed their name
- 

were Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam; the participants themselves,


mostly younger artists &amp; poets, witnesses to mid-ecntury war
&amp; 

holocaust from which, in 1948, Europe was just emerging.  Short-lived


as the &quot;movement&quot; was (it would dissolve by 1951), it
was to that 

degree &quot;international,&quot; with links - often reiterated
- to other 

postwar groups [Situationism, Lettrism] that sought new ways of
life 

through art.  An aspect of their project was therefore political
&amp; social 

- a belief in the transformation of art itself as instrument (in
its 

experimental modes) of even larger transformations.  In a move


reminiscent of earlier Dadaist disgust, Cobra artists turned from


&quot;Western Classical c ulture,&quot; not so much to so-called
&quot;primitive&quot; art 

(too often conflated with the &quot;Non-Western&quot;) as to the
art of children, 

say, &amp; the &quot;outsider art&quot; of the insane.  The result
was a commitment 

to a rawness &amp; openness of form (&quot;we never permit ourselves
to finish 

a poem&quot; - C.Dotremont) &amp; for many of them a further &quot;erasure
of the 

boundaries between the arts&quot; (in the words of a major forerunner,
Kurt 

Schwitters).  Artists &amp; poets worked together or crossed into
each 

others' domains, &quot;committed to marrying poetry with the plastic
arts&quot; 

(J.C. Lambert), or from a recognition (thus: Asger Jorn) that
&quot;painting 

and writing are the same.&quot;
<p>
 Along with Jorn &amp; Dotremont, the principal Cobra artists
were 

the Belgian artist-writers Pierre Alechinsky and Hugo Claus &amp;
the 

Dutch experimentalists Lucebert, Constant, Gerrit Kouwenaar, &amp;
to a 

lesser degree Bert Schierbeck.  A further connection - largely

 What we have here is a language poetry - a poetry of diverse


experimental means - two decades or more before a group of 

American poets would offer up their work as &quot;language poetry&quot;
per se.  

And there is also a push in Cobra toward a coincidence of word
&amp; 

image that was being taken in new directions by the (so-called)


Concrete Poets of the 1950s/60s - one of the few movements (like
the 

closely related Fluxus) with a genuinely international standing.
 That 

many of its works could readily cross borders was in part a function
of 

their stripped-down (= minimalist) nature: a reduction of the
poem to a 

sign (often in bold typography, sometimes in color) that typically


eliminated syntax &amp; even words themselves, thus offered up
an image 

open to interpretation (reading) at a single glance.  In a larger
sense the 

same mind-set that produced concrete poetry tied it not only to
other 

(older) forms of visual poetry but - more surprisingly perhaps
- to 

radical forms of sound poetry &amp; textsound performances.  Practitioners


were also drawn to &quot;process poetry&quot; &amp; to experiments
with 

reduplicating verbal patterns or, as the semiotics of the work


developed, to pieces that dispensed with words in favor of a purely


visual, often photographic, image.

 The following, however divergent from the concrete norm, is 

by the great American conretist Emmett Williams: a version of
The Red 

Chair (circa 1960) - here set for three voices.

 The last grouping I'll mention is Japanese, &amp; what I'll do
here 

is read the opening paragraph of our introduction to the grouping
in 

Millennium.  (The Beats are also included, by the way, but no
need to 

tell you about them; &amp; still other movements are represented
by 

scattered individual poets.)<BR>

 &quot;Against the view - Japanese &amp; Western both - of a 

traditional Japanese poetry defined by long-established canons
of 

brevity &amp; refinement, the work of post-World War II generations


shows an enormity of means &amp; voice that turns the old ways
upside 

down (or seems to), while bringing those ways simultaneously into


the present.  Less resembling the mode of haiku and  tanka (waka)


- for those of us who view them from the outside - fthan that
of 

a ghost-ridden poets' theater like the traditional Noh or 

contemporary Buthoh, their work becomes 'a celebration in 

darkness which is at once weird and refined, scatalogical and
lofty, 

comic and serious.'  (Thus: Yoshioka Minoru, early among the 

'postwar' poets.)  As with other new poetries, that of Japan's


'postwar' poets moves increasingly toward the demotic (colloquial,


everyday), bringing in a range of new - often foreign - 

vocabularies &amp; imageries, along with a mix of class &amp;
gender 

usages (long separated into discreet social levels) &amp; a 'violation
of 

grammatical norms carried to the point of linguistic rapine' (Roy


Andrew Miller).  On their literary side - Miller again - the 

resultant poems display a 'stripping-away of all the customary


decorations and embellishments of traditional Japanese poetics'


toward a 'naked language' (hadaka no gengo) &amp; 'what may very


well be their single most salient structural feature - the great


freedom and variety displayed by the poetic line that they employ.'&quot;
<p>
 The following are examples, then, of how the Japanese 
&quot;postwar&quot; could function.

<font size=5> C</font>ONCLUSION.  The point of this presentation is retrospective.
 It 

is not a point I would have made - or would easily have made -


during the period itself.  I understood that it was necessary
at that time 

for American poets to make what George Quasha and I called (in
our 

1970 anthology America a Prophecy) &quot;a declaration of independence&quot;


for American poetry.  We were speaking then of the ongoing 

domination &amp; intrusion of British letters and language that
had haunted 

us into the 1950s, but we were aware at the same time that our
work if 

it was to mean, to signify in that special sense, would have to
take its 

place in a &quot;revolution of the word&quot; that had developed
as well outside 

the native shores.  We also found - increasingly - that it was


possible to join &amp; to make common cause with poets &amp; artists


everywhere (not an everywhere which was nowhere but an everywhere


made up of many somewheres).  If Charles Olson spoke of a &quot;new


localism&quot; that would feed our historic &amp; poetic senses,
it seems to me 

now that it is increasingly possible - &amp; necessary - to speak
of a 

new globalism.  That this has its own complications is obvious
as well, 

but it also has its own richness &amp; for many of us it has brought
a sense 

of personal &amp; artistic relationships &amp; collaborations
that have grown up 

over the last half century.  In light of this it is time (&amp;
long past time) to 

consider the 1950s - the decade of the postwar &amp; the burgeoning
cold 

war - as the time also of a global awakening, &amp; to view (or
re-view) 

the New American Poetry as part of a greater, still more electrifying


symposium of the whole.

to apply it to Eliot ad hominem &amp; to let The Waste Land

<a href="50s.html#3">(3)</a>  I announced - as a scheduled publication of Hawk's Well Press,
which David Antin and I had founded 
circa 1957 - an anthology of Dada poetry in translation with the
title That Dada Strain.  It was intended 
to supplement Motherwell's anthology, which had very few poems
as such, despite its other virtues.  That 
Dada Strain never came out as an anthology, though I used the
title much later for a book of my own 
poems.

him to Paul Celan qua poet &amp;

<P>
<a href="50s.html#5">(5)</a>  As the editors are well aware, there's a notable lack of women
in these opening entries - offset, in the 
natural course of things by a strong female presence as the book
&amp; the century unwind.  Thus in the 
second gallery (post-1960), eight of the last ten entries (six
of eight by another count) are women - a 
change in the demographics of avantgardism &amp; a far cry from
the 1950s (since that's the topic now at 
hand).<BR>
