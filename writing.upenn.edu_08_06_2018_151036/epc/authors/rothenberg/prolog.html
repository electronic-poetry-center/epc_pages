<font size=5><b>PROLOGOMENA TO A POETICS</b></font><br>
<font size=3>for Michael McClure

<font size=4>

. . . . . . .
<p>
Poet man walks between dreams<br>
He is alive, he is breathing freely<br>
thru a soft tube like a hookah.<br>
Ashes fall around him as he walks<br>
singing above them.<br>
Oh how green<br>
the sun is where it marks<br>
the ocean. <br>
Feathers drift atop the hills<br>
down which the poet man<br>
keeps walking, walking<br>
a step ahead of what he fears,<br>
of what he loves.<br>
<br>
. . . . . . .<br>
<br>
Why has the poet failed us?<br>
Why have we waited, waited for the word to come again?<br>
Why did we remember what the name means<br>
only to now forget it?<br>
If the poet's name is god how dark the day is<br>
how heavy the burden is he carries with him.<br>
All poets are jews, said Tsvetayeva.<br>
The god of the jews is jewish, said a jew.<br>
It was white around him & his voice<br>
was heavy,<br>
like a poet's voice in winter,<br>
old & heavy,<br>
crackling,<br>
remembering frozen oceans in a summer clime,<br>
how contrary he felt<br>
how harsh the suffering was in him,<br>
let it go!<br>
The poet is dreaming about a poet<br>
& calls out.<br>
Soon he will have forgotten who he is.<br>
<br>
. . . . . . .<br>
<br>
Speak to the poet's mother,<br>
she is dead now.<br>
So many years ago she left her father's clime.<br>
His father too.<br>
The tale of wandering is still untold,<br>
untrue.  The tale of who you are,<br>
the tale of where the poem can take us,<br>
of where it stops<br>
& where the voice stops.<br>
The poem is an argument with death.<br>
The poem is priceless.<br>
Those who are brought into the poem can never leave it.<br>
In a silver tux the poet in the poem by Lorca<br>
walks down the hall to greet the poet's bride.<br>
The poet sees her breasts shine in the mirror.<br>
Apples as white as boobs,<br>
says Lorca.<br>
He is fed the milk of paradise,<br>
the dream of every poet man<br>
of every poet bride.<br>
The band plays up<br>
the day unstops & rushes out to greet<br>
another night.<br>
<br>
<br>
. . . . . . .<br>
<br>
Is the black poet<br>
black?<br>
And is the creation of his hands & throat<br>
a black creation?<br>
Yes, says the poet man<br>
who wears three rings,<br>
the poet man who seeks the precious light,<br>
passes the day beside a broken door<br>
no one can enter.  Hold it shut,<br>
the god cries & the jew rolls over<br>
in his endless sleep.<br>
Gods like little wheels glide past him<br>
down the mountain road where cats live<br>
in a cemetery guarded by his father's star,<br>
a poet & a bride entangled in the grass,<br>
his hands are black<br>
his eyes the whitest white<br>
& rimmed with scarlet.<br>
Hear the drumbeat,<br>
heart.<br>
The blacks have landed on the western shore<br>
the long lost past of poetry revives.<br>
<br>
<br>
. . . . . . .<br>
<br>
Our fingers fail us.<br>
<br>
Then tear them off! the poet cries<br>
not for the first time.<br>
The dead are too often seen filling our streets,<br>
who hasn't seen them?<br>
A tremor across the lower body,<br>
always the image of a horse's head<br>
& sandflies.<br>
A woman's breast & honey.<br>
She in whose mouth the murderers stuffed gravel<br>
who will no longer speak.<br>
The poet is the only witness to that death,<br>
writes every line<br>
as though the only witness.<br>
