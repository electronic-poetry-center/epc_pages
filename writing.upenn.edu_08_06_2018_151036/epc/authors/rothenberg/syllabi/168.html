<font size=3>
The course will be an introduction to the first poetry and art
of the  
Americas.  By using examples from a wide range of traditional
native cultures we will attempt both to understand these arts
in their  
own terms and to relate them to traditional and contemporary 
practices in the non-Indian world.  Among the topics to be covered
are the languages of shamanism; ritual performances that integrate
a  
variety of artistic modes; mythmaking and oral narration;  
pictographic and signing poetry; monumental sculpture and  
hieroglyphic writings, and the poetry and performance practices
of  
sacred clowns and tricksters.
