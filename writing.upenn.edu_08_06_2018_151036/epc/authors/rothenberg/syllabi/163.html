Modern and Postmodern Poetry [I] <br>

 <hr>

A survey of early twentieth-century avant-garde poetry as a vehicle
for the transformation of society and mind.  We will look both
at  
individual poets and at those movements (Futurism, Dada,
Surrealism, Negritude, etc.) that covered a wide spectrum of arts
 

- not only poetry and related forms of writing and performance
 

but painting, sculpture, film, and what later came to be called
 

intermedia.  In doing so we will pay particular attention to how
the  

new poetry and art developed through collage, chance operations,
 

dream, and in &quot;the art of writing the manifesto.&quot;
