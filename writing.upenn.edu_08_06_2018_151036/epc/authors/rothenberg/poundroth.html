This is in reply to Tenney's query about my own statement that the the most
telling impact of Pound's work was on poets who politically, morally, might
have been at the greatest distance from it.  To start with my own experience
<p>
-- growing up when I did -- the presence of Pound in the late 1940s was, to
say the least, a bewilderment.  I was stunned by much of the poetry, both
by how it read (the language of it) and by what I heard it saying: anti-war
& anti-capital & powerful too in its presentation of a way, a means, of
approaching & hoping to shape the world through the poet's means, the poetry
itself.  I was about 16 years old at a first reading of him & shortly
thereafter -- along with the reading -- came the awarding of the Bollingen
& the tremendous fuss that that stirred up (close to fifty years ago).  With
that we were aware also of the extent of Pound's fascism &, as became clearer
over the years, the viciousness of the anti-semitism in his World War II
broadcasts -- a lunacy of language common to the fringe of homegrown fascists
who were also in his entourage.  My own first published piece of writing was
a letter to the New York Post (a different NY Post at that time) in which
I lamented what I thought had happened to Pound and what had become (as it
still seems to be) a conundrum around the man & the work the man had given
us.  There was a lot I didn't know then but knowing it would certainly not
have made it easier.
<p>
I was never, in any sense, a Poundian, since there were too many other threads
& lines coming into my awareness to allow a focus (in that sense) on any
single individual.  But the observation of Pound's impact -- on myself &
others -- began shortly after that: the observation that those who were
most significantly building on Pound's poetics & actual poetry were not the
crazies & the fascist hoods of the John Kasper variety, etc., but poets
like Kelly, Olson, Duncan, Mac Low, Blackburn, & before them the whole
gallery of "Objectivists" or -- from other directions -- any number of
European and Latin American writers -- all of them (as I understood it) with
a political and moral sense (coming out of World War II) that was
strongly anti-fascist, strongly in opposition to the totalitarian barbarisms
for which Pound (in the years of his fascist infatuation) had become a
minor flunky.  In their context Pound became, remained a vital force -- the
proof, through them, of what was right & germinal about him and the proof,
conversely, of what was evil -- & banal in Hannah Arendt's sense -- in
his succumbing to the "fascist temptation."
<p>

What Pound offered and in some sense made possible wasn't divorced from the
political but wasn't at the same time tied to what became HIS politics.
It was a demonstration of how the political -- as history -- could enter
the body of the poem -- how the poem could thrive on what Ed Sanders
(many years later & clearly drawing on Pound) spoke of as "data clusters"
defining a new "investigative poetry".  I don't need to go on with this, I
think, except to note that it was (as far as I can recollect) not the
little fascists who learned from this but poets who by disposition and, I
believe, commitment were looking for a way out of the fascist &
totalitarian nightmare that had threatened to overwhelm our world.  And
there was also -- stronger in Pound than in most other forerunners in
the North American context -- a sense that history & poetry could be
redefined, opened up and certainly renewed, and that for this Pound himself
(as Charles B., I think, points out in his Pound essays) was a stepping-
stone, a guide to things that his fascist leanings would have finally
precluded.  He was clearly the most extraordinary translator we had by then
produced -- not only pointing to Albigensian Provence and to a sense of
China speaking to the present, but (coming like Cesaire and the other
Negritude poets) from the likes of Frobenius, forming one of the links (but
only one) to an African past as a pinnacle, too, of the creative human
spirit.  It is not to say that this was -- all of it -- of Pound's doing
but that he helped to set much of it in motion -- much of what, coming
after him  & (in some sense in spite of him) -- became essential to our
present work.
<p>

And, finally, I would point out what was -- for myself & others -- the
lesson of Pound's failure -- the lesson of the poet who had in the long run
betrayed his poetry.  It is a terrible thing to say and it is, I think, a
terrible possibility that faces all of us.  But it is Pound who also says
it best, from the "pull down thy vanity" voice in Canto 81 to the still
more telling voice (where he was already into his silence, depression) in
Canto 116:
<pre>
        I have brought the great ball of crystal
                          who can lift it?
        Can you enter the great acorn of light?
                 But the beauty is not the madness
        Tho' my errors and wrecks lie about me.
        And I am not a demigod,
        I cannot make it cohere.
</pre>

I can read this, anyway, as both a confession of failure (and of betrayal --
of himself & us) and at the same time a triumph of whatevr is there
speaking through him.  But not Pound alone -- for which let me end, Tenney,
by copying out (in what's already a long message) a poem by Julien Beck
(of the Living Theater, etc. (a good pacifist & anarchist & anti-fascist),
who I think loved all the poets that he mentioned in it.  It's one too
that Pierre and I are hoping to include -- along with a number of others --
in a section of manifestos for the next volume of Millennium.
