    <h1 class="style4"> Brooklyn: Hanging Loose Press, 2002 - Book Review </h1>
      <p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="style7">Literary Review Fall, 2002 &nbsp;by Mark Hillringhouse </span></p>
      <p><span class="style7"><br>
      </span>
            </p>
      <p class="style7">In the strange world of Paul Violi, a briefcase containing a poetry manuscript is stolen and all its loose pages of poetry </p>
      <p class="style7">are laterfound strewn in curbside puddles all over Lower Manhattan. On the way for an egg cream at Dave's Luncheonette</p>
      <p class="style7"> downtown, customers argue about whether a homeless woman who's been sleeping in the garbage bin outside for three </p>
      <p class="style7">days in the freezing cold is dead or alive. In a story about well diggers and their moronic discussion that begins with the </p>
      <p class="style7">weather and ends in thoughts on marriage and feminism, one guy's mother arrives to knock sense into him. There's a</p>
      <p class="style7"> story about cheap prostitutes in a back street of Istanbul, and a story about a Chinese gang fight in the Village, and a </p>
      <p class="style7">story about a cane-wielding, lecherous old man hobbling after a young woman down Beacon Street in Boston, </p>
      <p class="style7">and there's a story about a group of guys and a girl driving a new Mercedes to Iran, and a story about a</p>
      <p class="style7"> Holland Tunnel toll collector having a seizure while managing to hand over motorists their correct change. </p>
      <p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">This is Violi's first collection of short prose, and these stories are about his personal encounters with life's curve balls.</p>
    <p class="style7"> The speaker in these stories is always on the move, always managing to escape harm's way at the last minute. He hitches</p>
    <p class="style7"> rides, boards crowded buses and hops sweltering trains, and he is frequently stopped by police or border guards, or he is</p>
    <p class="style7"> dropped off at the edge of town to find a place to bed down for the night with his sleeping bag, either on a park bench or</p>
    <p class="style7"> at an empty soccer stadium. These are the field reports from an itinerant American, a man of letters, a sixties bohemian, </p>
    <p class="style7">who left the comfort of middle-class suburbia to see the world. The best of these make the reader feel the loneliness of </p>
    <p class="style7">what it is like to be a stranger among strangers. </p>
    <p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">These pieces attempt to convey that there is very little sense to what happens day to day. He can take the reader from the</p>
    <p class="style7"> outskirts of Nepal on a speeding train where the speaker gets into a brawl with some fellow passengers over his stolen</p>
    <p class="style7"> wallet, to a car crash on the Palisades Parkway near Bear Mountain, and a father's desperate attempt to revive the</p>
    <p class="style7"> battered body of his dead son. Violi writes about how things go awry, how clumsy and awkward life feels, and how</p>
    <p class="style7"> tragedy occurs in a split second, as in the opening prose piece "At the Deli" where a man crashes through a plate glass </p>
    <p class="style7">window at a Jersey diner while customers continue eating and the nonplussed waitress calmly wipes up the blood with dispenser</p>
    <p class="style7"> napkins. </p>
    <p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">Violi has always managed to capture the oddments of daily life in and out of the great metropolis in his many books of poems.</p>
    <p class="style7"> When I asked Pulitzer-Prize-winning poet James Schuyler what his favorite book of poems was for that year, without hesitating</p>
    <p class="style7"> he said, "Paul Violi's Splurge." That's when I began to admire Violi's work, and this latest book picks up on that early book </p>
    <p class="style7">of poetry's many wonderful and strange ironic twists. Splurge was a transforming experience for me as a reader, and so is this</p>
    <p class="style7"> collection of short tales that burst with poetic insight into the social fabric of our human universe. One of Violi's great gifts </p>
    <p class="style7">as a writer is his ability to transform the ordinariness of the everyday into the strangely fascinating. </p>
    <p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">A poet who is a member of the Saint Mark's Poetry Project (he was one of its first directors for a time), and as someone I consider</p>
    <p class="style7"> part of the "Second Generation" of New York School poets (Violi once worked for the Museum of Modern Art as poetry coordinator),</p>
    <p class="style7"> Violi's close association with that school of poets and painters has led him to incorporate some of that style into his own. Violi is able</p>
    <p class="style7"> to weave the fine human detail of life's numberless interactions by incorporating overheard conversations, and with a painter's eye </p>
    <p class="style7">for colorful detail, he creates an almost surreal canvas. His interest is in how the outer world penetrates the mysterious inner world</p>
    <p class="style7"> as he searches for whatever solace there is in that cruel, bizarre world to instruct the spirit against the loss of meaning. </p>
    <p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">There are resonant echoes in this writing from earlier books of poems such as In Baltic Circles, and Harmatan, writing that announced</p>
    <p class="style7"> Violi as a poet worth noting. And like his many poems, these stories derive their substance from his many travels that include</p>
    <p class="style7"> wandering around Africa, Europe, and Asia. If I had to choose just one of these stories, I would choose "Out of the Blue," a tale</p>
    <p class="style7"> about crossing borders (one of Violi's favorite subjects), where the speaker, after the limbo of a crowded bus ride, from India</p>
    <p class="style7"> to "Nowhere" on a dusty road, is taken to an infirmary for failing to pay a bribe to a customs agent. The irony is that the quarantine </p>
    <p class="style7">appears as a heavenly refuge for the weary narrator. It is spotless and there are clean beds and it is empty. Violi can nail down a </p>
    <p class="style7">single moment with a few vivid descriptions and he is able to create the tension of a scene and bring the image to focus and give the</p>
    <p class="style7"> reader a sense of the immediacy of a place with colorful details of turbaned bus riders spitting out pistachio shells and a bus driver </p>
    <p class="style7">who proudly turns around to boast to his passengers, "`A Buick engine! A Buick!' and not look back until at least a few of us applauded." </p>
    <p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">I applaud these stories and with Violi as your rough guide you will find yourself laughing and crying at the mishaps and</p>
    <p class="style7">misadventures on your way to some very strange and some very familiar places. </p>
