 The July/August 1996 issue of <I>American Poetry Review</I>
featured a special supplement called &quot;Doubled Flowering:
From the Notebooks of Araki Yasusada.&quot;  Translations of this
Japanese poet had already appeared  in such leading periodicals
as <I>Grand Street</I>,  <I>Conjunctions</I>, <I>Aerial</I>,
<I>First Intensity</I>, and Jon Silkin's British poetry
journal <I>Stand</I>.  According to Yasusada's three translators--Tosa
Motokiyu, Okura Kyojin, and Ojiu Norinaga--all three, like the
poet, from Hiroshima--Yasusada's notebooks were discovered by
his son in 1980, eight years following the poet's death.  These
fourteen notebooks contained dozens of poems, drafts, English
class assignments, diary entries, drawings, letters, and recordings
of Zen dokusan encounters.  None of this material, it seems, 
had been published during Yasusada's lifetime.   The following
 biographical note, prepared by the translators, appears, with
slight variation in each of the periodicals cited above:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>  Yasusada was born in 1907 in the city of Kyoto,
where he lived until 1921, when  his family moved to Hiroshima.
 He attended Hiroshima University sporadically between  1925 and
1928, with the intent of receiving a degree in Western Literature.
 Due,  however, to his father's illness, he was forced, in the
interests of the family, to  undertake full-time employment with
the postal service and withdraw from his formal  studies.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  In 1930 he married his only wife Nomura, with whom
he had two daughters and a  son.   In 1936, Yasusada was conscripted
into the Japanese Imperial Army and worked as  a clerk in the
Hiroshima division of the Military Postal Service.  His wife and
youngest  daughter Chieko, died instantly in the atomic blast
on August 6.   His daughter Akiko  survived, yet perished less
than four years later from radiation sickness.  His son,  Yasunari,
an infant at the time, was with relatives outside the city.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Yasusada died in 1972 after a long struggle with
cancer.<BR>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We are further told that Yasusada was active in avant-garde groups
of the pre-War period like <I>Soun </I>[<I>Layered Clouds</I>]
and the experimental renga circle <I>Kai</I> [<I>Oars</I>]
and that in the sixties he &quot;discovered&quot; Jack Spicer
and Roland Barthes (APR 23).  A 1967 letter to his renga collaborator
Akutagawa Fusei, included in the <I>APR</I> selection,
talks enthusiastically of Barthes's <I>Empire of Signs</I>
(24), and the translators further comment that there are undated
haiku that &quot;unmistakably bear the stamp of the famous poet,
and Holocaust survivor, Paul Celan,&quot; whose work &quot;was
read by the Layered Clouds group and critically discussed by them&quot;
(26).
<P>
 The poems--of which more in a moment--have aroused great interest
and enthusiasm.  In response to the <I>Conjunctions</I>
portfolio, the poet Ron Silliman told his friends and fellow poets
on the Buffalo Poetics List that the journal had introduced &quot;a
poet whose work simply takes my breath away.&quot;   Citing the
short &quot;Telescope with Urn,&quot; which begins with the line
&quot;The image of the galaxies spreads out like a cloud of sperm,&quot;
Silliman remarks, &quot;There's an elevation of tone in these
poems that reminds me more of Michael Palmer than Spicer, perhaps
because the translators are all Hiroshima poets (one of whom seems
to spend half of each year in Sebastapol [CA], although I don't
know if he's known to [David] Bromige or to Cydney Chadwick).
 These works kept me up last night and probably will again for
another night or three.  I recommend them highly.&quot;
<P>
 Yet even as the Yasusada poems were prompting this sort of response,
the word was leaking out that there was no Yasusada, that indeed
the whole Yasusada publication was an elaborate hoax, perpetrated,
most probably, by one Kent Johnson,  a young poet-professor at
Highland Community College in Freeport, Illinois.  Johnson, the
co-editor, with Stephen M. Ashby, of an anthology of New Russian
poetry called <I>The Third Wave</I> (Ann Arbor: University
of Michigan Press, 1992), and, with Craig Paulenich, of an anthology
of contemporary American Buddhist poetry called <I>Beneath
a Single Moon</I> (Boston and London: Shambhala, 1991), still
doesn't admit to inventing Yasusada; he now declares that the
&quot;real&quot; author is the Yasusada translator Tosa Motokiyu
(a pseudonym, in its turn, of yet another unknown poet who is
safely dead).   But when <I>American Poetry Review</I>
and <I>Stand</I> recently demanded the return of their
author's payment, it was to Kent Johnson they addressed their
letters.  And since he is at the very least the middleman and
facilitator of the &quot;hoax,&quot; as a matter of convenience,
I shall refer to him here as its author.
<P>
 According to <I>Lingua Franca</I>, which ran an article
on &quot;The Hiroshima Poetry Hoax&quot; in its November 1996
issue, Arthur Vogelsang, one of the three editors of <I>American
Poetry Review</I>, went so far as to call Johnson's deception
a &quot;criminal act.&quot;  Wesleyan University Press, which
had contemplated publishing a volume of Yasusada poems, immediately
dropped the project: an anonymous reader, whose report was made
available to me by Kent Johnson, expressed great admiration for
the poems but felt queasy at the suggestion that the manuscript
might be a hoax, it being out of bounds, in the reader's estimation,
for anyone to impersonate a figure as ipso facto tragic as a Hiroshima
survivor.  
<P>
 While these editors and publishers have taken issue with what
they perceive as the immorality of the hoax, scholars have objected
to its inaccuracy.  &quot;This is just Japanized crap,&quot; John
Solt, a professor of Japanese culture at Amherst College, told
<I>Lingua Franca</I>'s Emily Nussbaum.  &quot;It plays
into the American idea of what is interesting about Japanese culture--Zen,
haiku, anything seen as exotic--and gets it all wrong, adding
Western humor and irony&quot; (LF 83).   Yet this estimate may
also be a simplification.  For Solt, like APR's Vogelsang and
the anonymous reader for Wesleyan, are assuming that Kent Johnson
(or whoever the &quot;real&quot; Yasusada turns out to be) produced
as accurate a simulation as possible, whereas the fact is that
the author has put in, surely not unintentionally, any number
of clues that raise questions as to Yasusada's authenticity. 
Consider the following:
<P>
1) The name Araki Yasusada means, in Japanese usage, that Araki
is the family name, Yasusada the first name.  Araki is indeed
a common family name in Japanese.  Yet the &quot;translators&quot;
regularly refer to the poet as Yasusada, which would be equivalent
to referring to Roland Barthes as Roland.   By the same token,
the poet's wife's name, Nomura, is in fact a family name, not
a first name, so the reference given would be like Robert Lowell
referring to his wife as Hardwick.  Again, &quot;Motokiyu&quot;
is a mispelling for &quot;Motokiyo&quot; and &quot;Ojiu&quot;
 should be &quot;Ogyu.&quot;  So the author is, at the very least,
playing fast and loose with Japanese names.
<P>
2)  It is hard to accept the explanation that Yasusada, who was
supposedly active in avant-garde groups in the 1920s and 30s,
never tried to publish any of his postwar poems and that they
were entirely unknown in his native Japan, where he seems to have
had the liveliest of correspondences with his fellow poets.  
<P>
3)  Yasusada, we are told,  &quot;attended Hiroshima University
sporadically between 1925 and 1928, with the intent of receiving
a degree in Western Literature.&quot;    His attendance must have
been sporadic indeed since Hiroshima University was not founded
until 1949.   As for studying Western Literature, there would
have been no such subject.   English Literature, French Literature--these
were and are academic subjects, but the idea of Yasusada studying
&quot;Western&quot; literature looks like an American representation
of what a Japanese might do.  
<P>
4)   Yasusada ostensibly came under the influence of Jack Spicer
in the mid-60s, which is to say when Yasusada was in his late
fifties.  This is implausible on a number of counts.  First, Jack
Spicer was an unknown coterie poet at the time; indeed, he is
still largely an unknown coterie poet, whose work does not appear
in any of the major anthologies.  It is, of course, conceivable
that the poet's friend Natsume Kuribayashi brought the book <I>After
Lorca</I> (1957) back to Hiroshima from a visit to San Francisco.
  But if so, Yasusada must have been the only poet in Japan who
took an interest in Spicer.
<P>
5)   Roland Barthes is listed as a second major influence.  But
 <I>The Empire of Signs</I>, which Yasusada supposedly
pored over in 1967, wasn't even published in French until 1970.
 The U.S. edition dates from 1982.  There is thus no way Yasusada
could have read this book, and Barthes' earlier works were, like
Spicer's, only very little known outside France.  
<P>
6) Paul Celan, ostensibly read and studied by the <I>Soun</I>
group before World War II, did not start publishing--and then
in German--until 1952.  So the notion that he was closely studied
in the Japan of the thirties is totally absurd.
<P>
7)  Finally, there is a wonderful clinamen in the November 7 1967
letter to the poet's collaborator, Fusei.  &quot;Besides Spicer,&quot;
writes Yasusada, &quot;there are interesting new books here waiting
for you by poets named Gary Snyder, Bob Kaufman, Kenneth Rexroth,
Howard McCord, Robert Creeley, Helen Adams [<I>sic</I>],
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.  Kuribayashi tells me that they were
strongly recommended to him by McCord, the owner of City Lights
Bookstore, a popular bookseller in San Francisco.&quot; (APR 26).
 Now we can, with a stretch of the imagination, accept the fact
that the sixty-year old Hiroshima survivor, whose poetic habits
would most probably have been formed much earlier, would interest
himself in the newest Beat poets from the U.S.  But the give-away
in the list is Howard McCord, not a Bay Area poet at all but a
poet-professor from Bowling Green University who was Kent Johnson's
college mentor.   Hence the sly footnote provided by Yasusada's
translators: &quot;Yasusada is confused here, as the real owner
of the City Lights Bookstore is Lawrence Ferlinghetti&quot; (APR
26).
<P>
 Clearly, if the inventor of the Yasusada persona had wanted to
cover his tracks, he need never have mentioned Howard McCord or
the influence of Celan on Yasusada, much less the Japanese poet's
reading of Barthes's <I>Empire of Signs</I>.  We can only
conclude that the &quot;real&quot; author wanted his readers to
find something perplexing in the Yasusada archive, that he purposely
set the stage for suspicion.  The very first poem in the APR Supplement,
for example, is represented as a &quot;modest gathering of haiku&quot;
sent to Yasusada's friend, the haiku master Ogiwara Seisensui.
 The poem is dated March 30, 1925 and goes like this:

<P>
But what are those &quot;scubadivers&quot; doing between the crysanthemums
and the iris?   The technology of scubadiving was not invented
until World War II, which also gave &quot;Yasusada&quot; the word
&quot;crematorium.&quot;  As for &quot;investors&quot; in line
10, this reference to capitalist activity does not exactly belong
to the haiku discourse radius of hyacinths and persimmons, cranes
and lichen.  The perspective is rather like Pound's in the <I>Homage
to Sextus Propertius</I> (1917), where the lines &quot;My
cellar does not date from Numa Pompilius, / Nor bristle with wine
jars,&quot; is followed by the startling, &quot;Nor is it equipped
with a frigidaire patent.&quot;   What such overlays do is to
take the material in question out of its temporal and spatial
frame, problematizing its representation and tone.    And this,
for Johnson-Yasusada, as for Pound-Propertius, is clearly intentional.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>Why, then,<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>given such
obvious clues as &quot;scubadivers&quot; and &quot;crematorium,&quot;
have editors and readers so quickly assumed that they are dealing
with an &quot;authentic&quot; Hiroshima poet?   We cannot just
dismiss these disseminators as ignorant, for they include editors
and writers as varied as they are talented.  Bradford Morrow,
for one, came to <I>Conjunctions</I> as an Ezra Pound scholar
and editor; he published, for example, the excellent facsimile
editions of the Pound-Wyndham Lewis Vorticist magazine <I>Blast</I>.
  Rod Smith's <I>Aerial</I> has played a central role in
the introduction of radical new poetries: the issue that includes
Yasusada's works also contains a preview of Joan Retallack's <I>Musicage</I>
as well as Cage's own piece &quot;Art Is Either A Complaint Or
Do Something Else&quot; and Jackson Mac Low's <I>Merzgedicht</I>
for Kurt Schwitters.   And there are few contemporary poets more
widely read, engaged, and intellectually lively than the poet-editor-critic
Ron Silliman, who declared that Yasusada's memorable phrases kept
him awake at night.
<P>
<CENTER>II</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>To understand why Silliman and Morrow, Jean
Stein of <I>Grand Street</I>, and Jon Silkin, the longtime
editor of the British radical quarterly <I>Stand</I> were
&quot;taken in&quot; by the Yasusada manuscripts, we must look
at the larger issues of multicultural and cross-cultural reception
on the current poetry scene.  The Yasusada case, I shall argue
here, can be understood as a reaction formation experienced by
a literary community that no longer trusts the individual talent
to rise above mass culture and hence must find a poetry worthy
of its attention in increasingly remote and improbable locations.
&quot;Excellence,&quot;  now largely dismissed as an essentialist
concept, is subordinated to issues of agency and positionality,
 the master text here no doubt still being Michel Foucault's famous
1969 essay, &quot;What Is an Author?&quot;  
<P>
 Foucault's central position, which has come to be <I>de rigueur</I>
in the academy, is that it is the culture that constructs or <I>writes</I>
the author, not vice-versa: &quot;the essential basis of . . .
writing is not the exalted emotions related to the act of composition
or the insertion of a subject into language.  Rather, it is primarily
concerned with creating an opening where the writing subject endlessly
disappears.&quot;   Disappears because, far from being &quot;free&quot;
to write whatever he or she wishes, the writing subject can only
work within the limits of the dominant discourse and hence is
no more than a function of the discourse within which it circulates.
  No longer then do we ask &quot;What has [the author] revealed
of his most profound self in his language&quot;?   The question
is rather, &quot;Where does [this discourse] come from; how is
it circulated; who controls it?  What placements are determined
for possible subjects?&quot; (MF 138).  Who, in other words, is
empowered to speak and from what position?  And, once these questions
become central, emphasis falls on those who have, thus far, not
been empowered to speak-- in earlier centuries, women and lower-class
writers; in our own moment, the victims of oppression of whatever
stamp: Colonialist, racist, sexist, homophobic, and so on.
<P>
 In practice, of course, these questions of positionality and
empowerment have become very complicated.   In the case of Yasusada,
it would be a simplification to suggest that the editors and readers
who responded so warmly to the work did so only--or even primarily--because
the poet was that rare thing, a previously unknown Hiroshima survivor,
a witness to the events of August 6, 1945.   But certainly the
Hiroshima witnessing is a central factor in the equation.  Let
me explain.
<P>
 From the fifties to the late eighties when the Cold War came
to an end, and with it, the urgency of world-wide protests against
the production and testing of nuclear weapons, an appreciable
 number of Japanese poetry books and anthologies appeared on the
horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  A recent such anthology is
Jiro Nakano's <I>Outcry from the Inferno: Atomb Bomb Tanka
Anthology</I>.   The preface is by the leading tanka poet
Seishi Toyota, a Hiroshima survivor who suffered from radiation
poisoning and declared that &quot;writing and reading atombic
bomb tanka are my karma and life-long work&quot; (p. xiii).  The
typical tanka in the anthology goes like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  <FONT SIZE=2>Like a demon or ghost</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  a man runs away</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  staggering--</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>  the scorched land of Hiroshima.   (Hatsuko Miyamae,

<P>
Or, occasionally more polemically:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  and grandmothers--</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  remember your losses,</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Defy the draft!                 (Momoyo Ishii,

</FONT>
<P>
 These tanka are obviously more notable for their subject matter
than for their poetic quality.  A more sophisticated version<FONT SIZE=2>
 </FONT>of Japanese atomic bomb literature is found in Richard
Minear's <I>Hiroshima: Three Witnesses</I>.  Minear's three
are the fabulist Hara Tamiki, the novelist Ota Yoko, and the poet
Toge Sankichi.  Toge is probably the key figure in Hiroshima literature:
his <I>Poems of the Atomic Bomb</I>, written in 1951 when
he was already dying from a radiation-related illness, has gone
through more than forty printings.  Instead of the haiku and tanka
he had used in his pre-war poetry, Toge here uses free verse,
with much rhetorical variation: onomatopoeia, repetition, elaborate
sound play. Here is the opening of &quot;Dying&quot; (in Minear's
translation), a poem that Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris have
chosen for inclusion in the second volume of their <I>Poems
for the Millenium</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<P>
And the poem concludes with a passage in which extinction is represented
not only verbally but metrically, four one-word lines culminating
in the silence of the final line, which contains no more than
a single question mark:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

</FONT>
<P>
Toge is probably the most noted realist chronicler of the Hiroshima
tragedy:  over and over again, he records the chaos and suffering
of ordinary people in the fire storms of August.  A short poem
of his called &quot;Give the People Back&quot; appeared in a 1985
<I>American Poetry Review</I> porfolio on Hiroshima poets,
in which Suneko Yoshikawa presents four poems (one of them her
own), translated by a Canadian poet Steven Forth. Here a full
page of background information is followed by two short pages
of poetry.  These poems are again straightforward and often polemic
monologues, as in the case of Hara Tamiki's &quot;Water Please,&quot;
with its lines like &quot;Help me     help   me / Water / Water/
 Somewhere / Someone.&quot;
<P>
 But although the testimonials of the <I>hibakusha</I>
(atomic bomb survivors) continue to play a central role in Japanese
culture, and although there has been a definite market for Hiroshima-witness
poems, especially in the West, the fact is--and this will shed
light on Yasusada's position--that contemporary Japanese poets
have been reluctant to write about Hiroshima or, for that matter,
about the culture of nuclear weapons.  No doubt, memories of a
war that the then wholly nationalist, autocratic, and bellicose
Imperial Japanese government had initiated are too painful; for
those born after 1945, moreover, these memories no longer seem
directly relevant.  &quot;It is difficult,&quot; the young poet-scholar
Nagahata Akitoshi remarked in a letter to me (January 15, 1997),
&quot;for us to talk about Hiroshima / Nagasaki, because to do
so would always make us question our subjectivity.  We are sons
and daughters of the people who were bombed, but at the same time
of the oppressors.  We could blame our fate on the politicians
at the time (i.e., militarists) or on the war in the abstract.
 But I think this is an evasion.&quot; 
<P>
 Nagahata's observations are confirmed by the literature.  Open
any volume like Leith Morton's <I>Anthology of Contemporary
Japanese Poetry</I> and you will find an extraordinarily colloquial,
often casual,  postmodern poetry that deals with every aspect
of sexuality, with themes of longing and frustration, memories
of childhood, contemplation of urban congestion and natural beauty,
with self-interrogation and remorse, the relation of private to
public, individual identity to culture and to the natural world--in
short, pretty much all the themes that would characterize our
own poetry.  Six of the sixteen poets in Morton's anthology are
women--and very emanicipated women at that.  The performance poet
Shiraishi Kazuko (b. 1931), for example,  has a poem written for
her friend Sumiko's birthday that is called &quot;Penis&quot;
(<I>Dankon</I>) and  begins:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  <FONT SIZE=2>God is not here but he exists</FONT>

<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Shiraishi had worked closely with Kenneth Rexroth: her  mode is
a ribald version of Beat or San Francisco Renaissance poems, going
back, perhaps, to the bitter-sweet erotic free verse poems of
Apollinaire.   Another free-verse poem, this time by a younger
woman poet, Ito Hiromi (.b. 1955), is called &quot;Don't Squash
Them,&quot; and begins:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  <FONT SIZE=2>I make some dumplings out of rice-flour and bring</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>  Them to my man  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Boil sugar and make a syrup</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>  Immerse the cooked dumplings in it</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Refrigerate them</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Pack them into an air-tight container</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  And bring them along</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The dumplings stick to the bottom of the container</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The skin of the dumplings remain stuck</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Scoop them up</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Without squashing them!</BLOCKQUOTE>  (LM 367)</FONT>
<P>
And the rest of the poem wittily relates the dumpling-eating incident
to their subsequent love making.   Throughout, the poet's tone
is one of detached bemusement, a tone we find most fully developed
in the work of the celebrated postwar poet Tanikawa Shuntaro who
has a predilection for short riddling lyrics or fables like &quot;The
Poet&quot;:

<P>
 Tanikawa, Ito, Shiraishi--these are hardly well-known poets in
the U.S.  Indeed, the very <I>American Poetry Review</I>
that published Yasusada and then called the submission of the
manuscript a &quot;criminal act,&quot; has, in the past fifteen
years, published no other translations of contemporary Japanese
poetry with the exception of the Hiroshima portfolio I cited above.
 Bengali women poets, underground Chinese, Polish and Rumanian,
Nicaraguan, and South African poets--all these appear in the pages
of APR as does a feature on two medieval Japanese women court
poets, as translated by Jane Hirschfield and Mariko Aratani, and
a  special supplement on the Zen Master Muso (Muso Sosei,1275-1351)
translated by W. S. Merwin with the help of Soiku Shigematsu.
 But the new Japanese poets, whose brilliance and variousness
are extremely impressive, are not sought out.  And I have noticed
the same trend in the other periodicals under consideration.
<P>
 Why this neglect of contemporary Japanese poetry?   Why the equation
of &quot;Japanese&quot; with the courtly or Zen tradition of the
distant past?  Perhaps because modern, or rather postmodern Japan
is too close to our own advanced capitalist world, too similar
in its First World obsession with technology, urban and ecological
problems, and so on.  To put it another way, Japanese poetry--most
of it in free verse and, like the poems above, in colloquial,
up-to-date idiom--will not allow itself to be patronized; it is
neither a poetry of victims nor of the oppressed, and it defines
itself as a poetry very much of the present rather than of the
historical imagination.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER>III</CENTER>
<P>
 How Japanese, then, is Yasusada's lyric?   And how does that
lyric relate to our own late twentieth-century paradigms?   Let
me begin with the poem that so impressed Ron Silliman, &quot;Telscope
with Urn&quot; from <I>Conjunctions</I>: 
<P>
  
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

</FONT>
<P>
Compared to the Japanese poems I cited a moment ago, &quot;Telescope
with Urn&quot; is elliptical and fragmentary.  Each line, set
off from the next by double spacing, is a separate sentence, and
the sentences, while straightforward syntactically, tend not to
connect.  Reference, moreover, is often unclear as in &quot;I
like to think of that, said the monk, arranging them with his
papery fingers,&quot; where we know neither what &quot;that&quot;
is nor what &quot;them&quot; the monk is arranging.  The poem's
ellipsis is coupled with syntactic inversion, as in &quot;Tiny
were you&quot; and &quot;What a big girl! cried we,&quot; with
the Zen-like repetition of such phrases as &quot;It is like the
idea of the flowers, opening within the idea of the flowers,&quot;
and with the circomlocution of &quot;squatted over a sky-colored
bowl to make water.&quot;  
<P>
 The effect of such devices is that the poem has a reassuringly
&quot;archaic,&quot; &quot;oriental&quot; feel; its reticence,
dignity, and elusiveness, its references to Mount Horai, flowers,
and stars,  bring to mind the ritual and stylization of Noh and
Bunraku.   At the same time, the &quot;Japanese&quot; nature imagery
is eroticized in a distinctly modern way, and the &quot;scientific&quot;
reference to the &quot;velocity&quot; of the expansion of the
galaxies reminds us that this is an up-to-date lyric.  And not
just any up-to-date lyric but one about Hiroshima:  &quot;Telescope
with Urn&quot; refers to the death of the poet's young daughter
in the nuclear raid.   The urn with the crane on it is hers, and
the poem contrasts the enormity of the macrocosm (the galaxies)
with the terrifying microcosm of the life reduced to ashes inside
the small urn.
<P>
 Kent Johnson has thus found a perfect recipe for a new Orientalism,
conceived in the best American tradition of Emerson's doctrine
of &quot;natural&quot; hieroglyphic language, Pound's <I>Cathay</I>,
 and, most recently,  Kenneth Rexroth's <I>Love Poems of Marichiko</I>
(1978), presented by the poet as translations of the erotic lyrics
of an actual Japanese woman although Rexroth later admitted he
had made them up entirely himself.   The <I>Love Poems of Marichiko</I>,
which Johnson surely knew, provided him with a blueprint for the
fusion of concrete sexual imagery and &quot;Buddhist&quot; reticence.
<P>
 But in the wake of the disjunctive poetry of the eighties and
nineties, the demand is for greater obliquity, fragmentation,
dislocation. For these, Johnson evidently turned to one of Rexroth's
contemporaries, the Jack Spicer who produced the exotic <I>After
Lorca</I>.  Here is a sample:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>  <FONT SIZE=2>In the middle of my mirror</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   A girl is drowning</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   The voice of a single girl.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   She holds cold fire like a glass</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   Each thing she watches</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   Has become double.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   Cold fire is</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   Cold fire is.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   In the middle of my mirror</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   A girl is drowning</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   The voice of a single girl.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Spicer's poem is not as fragmented as Yasusada's but it has the
same simple declarative sentences, the concrete imagery, the direct,
naive tone, the delicate obliquity and ellipsis, as in &quot;Cold
fire is / Cold fire is.&quot; Like Spicer,  Yasusada is obsessed
by images of death, but, as Johnson has understood, in the post-Cold
War era, there is little calling for the realistic descriptions
of dismemberment favored by, say, Toge Sankichi.  At the same
time, Western guilt about the dropping of the bomb is such that
the reader is programmed to find Yasusada's muted references to
the Hiroshima &quot;tragedy&quot; moving, especially when these
references are matter-of-fact and stoic. 
<P>
 &quot;Telescope and Urn&quot; thus satisfies our longing for
a Japan, rather like that of Barthes's <I>Empire of Signs</I>,
an imaginary Japan that is gentler and more dignified than the
brash West, a world of graceritual, and transience, of elegant
calligraphy and Zen gardens, a world in which the wrapping of
packages is an art and chopsticks delicately separate bits of
food, unlike those Western knives and forks which brutally cut
up slices of meat.   &quot;It is like the idea of the flowers,
opening within the idea of the flowers.&quot;  Those delicate
flowers, perhaps, that emerge from little paper balls dropped
into a glass of water.  
<P>
 Consider another Yasusada poem, this one published in the little
magazine <I>First Intensity</I> under the title &quot;Mad
Daughter and Big-Bang&quot; and subtitled &quot;December 25, 1945*&quot;,
the mock footnote explaining that &quot;In the aftermath of the
bombing, many survivors moved into the hills, surrounding Hiroshima.
 This was the case with Yasusada and his daughter.  --eds.&quot;<SUP>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>Here the reference is again to the death
of the poet's daughter in the Hiroshima raid.  But the technique
is somewhat different:  for the elliptical and dislocated sentences
of &quot;Telescope and Urn,&quot; Johnson here substitutes narrative--a
kind of &quot;magic realist&quot; narrative in which events are
displaced and transformed.    The hallucinatory presence of the
dead child, transformed into a &quot;mad daughter,&quot; the speech
of the &quot;severed head,&quot; the Maenad-like image of &quot;dark
hair, comet-like, trail[ing] behind,&quot; and the title's ironic
allusion to &quot;Big-Bang&quot; theories--these give the poem
the semblance of a dream, or rather a nightmare.   At the same
time,  the daughter's &quot;sullen&quot; explanation that &quot;Some
boys buried me,&quot; is literally quite true if we take the &quot;boys&quot;
to be the U.S. military.   Again, in the poem's conclusion, the
surreal image  of &quot;Squatting, I pulled the turnip up by the
root,&quot; is accurate enough if we read it as a reference to
the easy removal of the charred and rotten corpse from the ground
in which the live body was &quot;rooted.&quot;   Such images play
into the residual guilt of contemporary American readers, even
as the poem's multiple ironies temper that guilt, allowing us
to concentrate on the effectiveness of Johnson's fiction, especially
the immediacy of the terse dialogue between father and daughter.
  
<P>
 One would be hard put to find actual Hiroshima witness poems
(or even later Japanese re-enactments of Hiroshima poems) that
are characterized by such irony and restraint, such self-consciously
surreal, oblique images.  Rather, the matter-of-factness of the
disconnected sentences, both here and elsewhere in the Yasusada
manuscript, recalls such long prose poems as Ron Silliman's <I>Tjanting</I>.
  A Yasusada poem in <I>Grand Street</I> #53 (1995), for
example, begins with the line &quot;The sake shop hisses with
its pleasures, all boiled up,&quot; and continues with such sentences
as &quot;Here is a black-haired man with a black-haired man,&quot;
or &quot;There are two sticks and a cup in Spring.&quot;  The
relationship of these present-tense, simple declarative sentences
to those that compose Japanese renga is taken up in a piece which
was evidently Yasusada's American debut, the &quot;tape-essay&quot;
called &quot;Renga and the New Sentence,&quot; conducted in Madison,
Wisconsin, December 1989, by Tosa Motokiyu, Ojiu Norinaga, and
Okura Kyojin--the three familiar Yasusada translators-editors--and
 published in <I>Aerial</I>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></SUP>
 The dialogue takes up the issue of what Ron Silliman, in a well-known
essay by that name, defined as &quot;The New Sentence, &quot;
a &quot;sentence&quot; that is the building block of the new &quot;poetic&quot;
prose, even as the line is the basic unit of the conventional
poem.  Tosa Motokiyu and his collaborators cite Silliman's definition
(see NS 91) verbatim:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>1.  The paragraph organizes the sentences;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> 2.  The paragraph is a unit of quantity, not logic
or argument;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> 3.  Sentence length is a unit of measure;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> 4.  Sentence structure is altered for torque, or
increased polysemy / ambiguity;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> 5.  Syllogistic movement is (a) limited; (b) controlled.
. . .    (AER 54)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Silliman, they note, claimed that the only precursor of the &quot;New
Sentence&quot; was the William Carlos Williams of <I>Kora in
Hell</I>, but, as they demonstrate, the &quot;New Sentence&quot;
has a more significant source in &quot;the Japanese haiku renga--forms
that anticipate by more than four centuries a number of the principles
underlying 'new sentence' approaches to composition&quot; (AER
52). As Motokiyu explains it, renga, like the &quot;new sentence,&quot;
is animated by &quot;the faith that non-syllogistic movement may
open onto alternate forms of perception&quot; (AER 52).  In twentieth-century
experimental renga, moreover, &quot;the stanzas shatter their
prosodic constraints and move brazenly into prose,&quot; forcing
&quot;the written into new conceptual territory&quot; (AER 52).
 And Kyojin cites Earl Miner's definition of renga in <I>Japanese
Linked Verse</I>:
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=2>(T)he renga is no single thing.  It has been practiced
in short versions of two stanzas and  in long versions up to ten
thousand. . . (T)he art of linked poetry involves adding stanzas
 in such a fashion as to keep something but to change the meaning
of what might be called  the stanza itself and the stanza in connection
with its predecessor.  In such fashion the  sequence is truly
sequential and a sustained plot is impossible.   (AER 52, ellipses
are he  author's).</FONT>
<P>
Modes of linking, according to the translators, include &quot;flat
linking,&quot; &quot;mosaic linking,&quot; &quot;linking through
paragram,&quot; &quot;linking through assonances,&quot; and so
on, all these devices &quot;generating a prismatic and collective
textuality&quot; (AER 53).  And they cite a traditional renga
written by Matsuo Basho and Shita Yaba, which begins:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> (MB) At a fragrance of plums, a blob, the sun, appears
on a mountain path.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> (SY) here and there a pheasant call rises</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> (SY) talking with a bush in between--the autumn,

<P>
 The American Language poets now get a slight slap on the wrist
because &quot;they have not begun, really, to seriously move outside
the ideologically constructed parameters of single-author composition&quot;;
indeed, with rare exceptions like &quot;Legend&quot; (written
by Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Ray Di Palma, Steve McCaffery
and Ron Silliman), they have insisted on &quot;self attribution&quot;
and &quot;personal ownership&quot; of texts&quot; (AER 55).  They
should, according to our Japanese discussants, experiment more
fully with depersonalized Buddhist sensibilities, should eschew
ownership of their verse.  And now we are introduced to a renga
by three Hiroshima poets: Araki Yasusada, Ozaki Kusatao and Akutagawa
Fusei.
<P>
 This renga, ostensibly of the1930s is introduced by a defensive
letter of June 1937 from Yasusada to Ogiwara Seisensui, the head
of the <I>Soun</I> avant-garde group.   Yasusada defends
the &quot;impure&quot; linking used in their renga and argues
that &quot;<I>dissonance</I>&quot; is its &quot;deep measure.&quot;
 A footnote on the part of the translators tells us that this
letter is &quot;Among the over 100 carbon copies of Yasusada's
letters in our possession.  It is interesting that Yasusada and
his friends were very influenced by the American poet Jack Spicer;
indeed, a few of their renga are dedicated to him&quot; (AER 59).
 And they insert another letter, this one to Fusei, dated November
17, 1965, in which Yasusada describes his enthusiasm for the &quot;new&quot;
California poets whose books his friend Natsume Kuribayashi has
brought to Hiroshima:  Robert Duncan, Alex [sic] Ginsberg, John
Wieners, Brother Antoninus, Philip Lamantia, and especially Jack
Spicer, whose <I>Billy the Kid</I>, and <I>Heads of
the Town Up to the Aether</I> are declared to be kindred works.
<P>
 There are a number of incongruous details here.   Why, to begin
with,  would such &quot;experts&quot; as Tosa Motokiyu and his
friends rely on the American scholar Earl Miner's definition of
renga?    And how could the footnote to the 1937 letter refer
to the Spicer influence, Spicer then being twelve years old! 
Neither the editor of <I>Aerial</I> nor the journal's readers
seem to have been bothered by these lacunae, evidently because
the affiliation of the &quot;new&quot; Language poetry with the
&quot;old&quot; renga seemed so appealing, giving Silliman's own
poems a new authority.  Here are the first nine lines of the 
renga itself: 
<P>

</FONT>
<P>
The translator Okura Kyojin comments: &quot;Similarities with
'new sentence' writing seem compelling.  The hokku unit is now
extended out into pure prose utterance.  As Fusei says elsewhere:
&quot;no easy messages, no intention to share self-emotion; no
lyrical intensity--percussive soundings within patterns of harmonic
and dissonant chords.  Utterance as autonomous fact <I>and</I>
its saturation in context.  <I>This</I> tension.  Gaps
now as intrinsic to such grammar. . .'&quot; (AER 58, ellipses'
the author's).  
<P>
 What could sound more contemporary, more late twentieth-century
American than the frank sexual references to the &quot;sorority
girls&quot; who &quot;sing of fucking,&quot; and to &quot;cocks
and cunts&quot; as well as to the slang of &quot;Everybody was
fucking overjoyed&quot; or &quot;I had better look for him there
pronto.&quot;   And yet all the Japanese properties are here:
the &quot;willow leaves in the garden,&quot;  the &quot;screen
of moonflowers and creeping gourds,&quot; the &quot;master of
the house,&quot; the young girls' &quot;frail bodies&quot;  the
&quot;province of Kaga.&quot;  The layering of language registers
reminds me of nothing so much as Pound's <I>Electra</I>,
where the poet brings Sophocles' great tragedy into his own post-World
war II orbit (the play was written with Rudd Flemming while Pound
was incarcerated in St. Elizabeth's) by juxtaposing lines of the
original Greek (especially in Electra's speeches) to the Western
twang of Orestes' revenge speech:

or the flat vulgarities of Clytemnestra, here presented as a vindictive

<FONT SIZE=2>  insulting you and your gang. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In thus deconstructing the expected linguistic registers, Pound
found a way of relating Electra's ancient tragedy to his own situation
as a condemned war traitor.  
<P>
 In inventing a Japan to satisfy contemporary American fantasies
as to a less complicated, more orderly society---a society at
once highly refined and yet quite frank about sexuality -- Johnson
uses one other form of layering that deserves mention.  In all
the Yasusada portfolios published to date, the poems are embedded
in a larger archive, that consists of letters, English assignments
(see APR  25), commentaries, and elaborate footnotes.  The model
would be the palimpsestic notebooks of George Oppen, where drafts
of poems are surrounded by extracts from Heidegger and other philosophers,
by letters, autobiographical notes, source material, and so on.
 Clearly, contemporary readers have a predilection for this sort
of documentary material.  Yasusada, telling Kusatao in April 1965
that he has been in the hospital for a &quot;couple stays&quot;
(would any Japanese translator use this slang expression?), informs
his friend that &quot;The difficulty, as you know, is the sickness
after treatment.&quot;  &quot;Luckily,&quot; Yasusada adds, &quot;the
hospital wing they have me in looks out on the pine-covered hills
of Mount Asano&quot; (APR 25).  How authentic!  How vivid!  What
a reminder of the Hiroshima tragedy!  And Yasusada has an English
teacher, Mr. Rogers, who advises him to study the writer James
Joyce, &quot;who is famous for a form of writing called 'streams
[sic] of consciousness&quot; (APR 25).   Again, how quaint and
charmingly incorrect, at least when we don't probe too carefully
into the conundrum that Yasusada might not know Joyce although
he does know Spicer.  
<P>
<CENTER>4.</CENTER>
<P>
 Kent Johnson has, I think, done a brilliant job in inventing
a world at once ritualized and yet startlingly modern, timeless
yet documentary, archaicized yet <I>au courant</I>-- a
poetic world that satisfies our hunger for the <I>authentic</I>,
even though that authentic is itself a perfect simulacrum.  To
call his Yasusada impersonation a hoax, much less a &quot;criminal
act&quot; is of course absurd:  the pseudonym is a time-honored
device in literature, and from James McPherson's <I>Ossian</I>
to the present, writers have invented fictional personae and passed
them off as the real thing.  
<P>
 Still, there is something deeply troubling about the uncritical
reception of these &quot;Japanese&quot; poems and prose pieces,
with their brash distortions of literary and political history
and their questionable conjunctions of jarring verbal registers.
 Why is it, one wonders, that none of Yasusada's editors sought
out the guidance of bona fide Japanese poets, scholars, or translators?
 That they didn't read these &quot;newly found&quot; and never
before published works against the well-known brilliant poetries
of, say, Tanikawa Shuntaro?    And that, once exposed as having
been &quot;taken in&quot; by the hoax, they have put the blame
on everyone but themselves?   Let me try to summarize the reasons
why the &quot;hoax&quot; has worked so well, and why, so I believe,
similar inventions will occur with increasing frequency as we
move toward the millenium.
<P>
 First, most academics today (and most poets and editors, after
all, now hold academic posts) pay lip service to the Foucaultian
notion of cultural construction, of discourse networks that discipline
the individual talent.  Hence the search for novel and interesting
cultural positioning, as in the case of Araki Yasusada, that rare
Hiroshima survivor to have turned up so conveniently so late in
the day, with such a fascinating cache of never-before-published
poems and documents.  Never mind Araki Yasusada the individual:
 it is his identitarian self that matters, his occupation of the
position of avant-gardist who is also victim, disseminator of
Jack Spicer, Roland Barthes, and the Language poets, who is also
a traditional renga and haiku poet, purveyor of dissonant chords
and gaps in grammar who also has something centrally important
to say about atomic warfare, and quintessential neglected genius
who is also a communitarian, believing that there is no such thing
as &quot;ownership&quot; of one's writings.
<P>
 Yasusada thus satisfies, as fully as possible, the current disciplinary
demand. Yet, despite the continuing predilection for viewing individual
poetry as the fruit of such cultural construction, there is another
demand, this one deep-seated and instinctive, for individual authenticity,
for uniqueness, for the Benjaminian aura that comes only in the
presence of the Real Thing, not its copies.   Look at that letter
written from the Hiroshima hospital in 1965!  Look at the elegiac
lines written to a particular wife and daughter!  Look at the
correspondence with his very own English teacher and the mistakes
that Yasusada makes in his assignments, mispelling words like
&quot;him&quot; (&quot;Hime&quot;), &quot;sky&quot; (&quot;skye&quot;)
 and &quot;patrolling&quot; (&quot;patroleling&quot;) in ways,
so my Japanese sources tell me, no Japanese student of English
who was as far along as Yasusada, would possibly make   These
ancillary documents, in any case, humanize the situation; they
give Yasusada a particular habitation and a name and make his
work more accessible for the readers of <I>American Poetry
Review</I> or <I>Grand Street</I>.  
<P>
 Accessibility, in this case, has much to do with the paradox
that even as Yasusada's poetry  satisfies an American reader's
demand, his work <I>makes no demand on us</I>.   We can
empathize with the &quot;tragedy&quot; in which Yasusada was caught
up in the prime of his life (he was thirty-eight at the time of
the nuclear attack), without having to think through the ethical
issues involved  in any serious way.   The Yasusada archive puts
forward no choice we would have to make, triggers no moral or
psychological debate we might engage in.  Rather, the work's mode
is, as I remarked earlier,  Orientalism, &quot;that Western style,&quot;
in Edward Said's words, &quot;for dominating, restructuring, and
having authority over the Orient-- an Orient represented since
antiquity as &quot;a place of romance, exotic beings, haunting
memories and landscapes, remarkable experiences.&quot;  And the
great irony of the current situation in American letters is that
the New  Multiculturalism, far from countering the Orientalism
Said decried as long as twenty years ago, has turned out to be
its inadvertent promoter.
<P>
 How did we get ourselves into this bind?  Partly, no doubt, because
our current skepticism, indeed cynicism, as to the power and efficacy
of government (that is, <I>our</I> government) is generally
coupled with an uncritical--or at least unquestioning-- attitude
toward the governments of other nations.  The Cold War, as it
is currently represented in the literary and visual arts, is almost
invariably <I>our</I> Cold War, the bombing of Hiroshima,
<I>our</I> infamy.  The complexities and contradictions
of geopolitics thus take a back seat to moral outrage on the one
hand, fictional construction on the other.
<P>
 As I was completing this essay, I happened to come across a front-page
article in <I>The New York Times</I> (January 22, 1997)
titled &quot;A Japanese Generation Haunted by Its Past,&quot;
the first of a series of articles on &quot;Main Street, Japan:
Wounds of War.&quot;  The reporter, Nicholas D. Kristof, interviewed
a group of old men in the small farm town of Omiya, 200 miles
southwest of Tokyo.  The men he spoke to are haunted by memories
of fifteen years of brutal warfare, from the invasion of Northern
China in 1931 through World War II.  They recall thrusting bayonets
through the chests of Chinese infants, committing acts of torture,
massacring civilians, raping young girls almost everywhere they
went--and  even committing cannibalism.  As a young soldier, Shinzaburo
Horie recalls, he ate the flesh of a 16-year old Chinese boy.
 &quot;It was only one time,&quot; he says, &quot;and not so much
meat, but after 60 years I can't put it behind me&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2> Mr. Horie and his buddies had eaten some rare fresh
meat that had suddenly  become availavable in the local market
in northeastern China one day in 1939, he  recalled.  Then the
kenpeitai, the Japanese secrete police, came around asking whether
 anyone had bought that meat in the market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Some Japanese soldiers who were hungry had
killed the boy and eaten some of  his meat and sold the rest to
the Chinese merchant, and we bought it from that  merchant,&quot;
 Mr. Horie said.  He added that he had heard that the Japanese
soldiers had  bee</BLOCKQUOTE>n punished  for the killing  and the cannibalism.
 (A6).</FONT>
<P>
The paradox, as Kristof puts it, is that men like Shinzaburo Horie
are now &quot;unfailingly courteous, gentle and honest.  They
are deeply respected in their communities, and everyone knows
they would never think of cheating anybody or losing their tempers.
 Yet they collectively killed 20 million or 30 million people&quot;
(A 6).  
<P>
 You won't find such paradoxes in the gentle, elegiac lyric of
Araki Yasusada, any more than you will in the angry anti-war poems
of Toge Sankichi.  The war memories are too painful and, for the
young, too remote.  The <I>Times</I> article reports that
many teenage students, expert at algebra and biology, cannot answer
the question, &quot;What country dropped the atomic bomb on Japan?&quot;
 &quot;Hmmmmm,&quot; muttered Naruki Orita, &quot;a 13-year old
boy who is known as a good student in Omiya Junior High School,&quot;
&quot;I'm not really sure.  I don't know.&quot;  &quot;Naruki,&quot;
writes Kristof, &quot;said he knew that his grandfather had died
in the war, but he did not know where&quot;  (A6).
<P>
 Kristof's is not, of course, the last word on this subject, and
it may be that the attitudes of young Japanese students to World
War II and Hiroshima are much more complex and varied than he
allows.   But, whatever the validity of the newspaper account,
the questions Kristof raises are suspended in Yasusada's poetry,
dealing as it does with personal memory and rather than with the
harder questions about responsibility and guilt.  The work thus
responds to the Romantic tenet that the poet (and by extension
the poet's audience) is committed to <I>feeling</I> rather
than <I>knowing</I>, to perception and intuition rather
than philosophy and history.   Indeed, the common prejudice that
poets, as well as their readers, are exempt from the pursuit of
complex ideas, dies hard:  witness the division, still standard
in American universities, between the departments of &quot;English
Literature&quot; and &quot;Creative Writing,&quot; the names implying
that scholarship and critical theory are not &quot;creative,&quot;
even as &quot;creative writing&quot; does not need to be informed
by theory or scholarship.
<P>
 In forcing us to think about these questions, Kent Johnson has,
whether intentionally or not, performed an invaluable service.
 His Yasusada manuscript challenges many dubious notions:  for
example, that the &quot;new sentence,&quot; as conceived by Ron
Silliman and his friends, has no precedent in poetry, that certain
&quot;tragic&quot; events cannot be the &quot;subject&quot; of
surreal or parodic treatment, and that literary influence (Spicer
and Barthes on Yasusada) exists if and when the influenced author
claims it does. Like Pound's <I>Homage to Sextus Propertius</I>,
the Yasusada notebooks force us to go back to the &quot;originals,&quot;
so as to see what they really were and how they have been transformed.
 One can argue, of course, that Pound did write <I>Propertius</I>
in his own name; he did not, as Johnson does, pose as someone
else.  But the fact is that Pound was already famous when he wrote
his Latin &quot;translation&quot; and so he could afford to be
Ezra Pound, whereas the unknown Kent Johnson, writing in what
is an increasingly glutted and cut-throat poetry market, had no
such alternative.   Johnson took, in other words, the <I>Ossian</I>
route rather than the route of Pound or of the Goethe of the <I>West-Oestlicher
Divan</I>.  But just as McPherson's <I>Ossian</I> brought
on a valuable reconsideration of the <I>medieval</I>, so
&quot;Yasusada&quot; may prompt us to familiarize outselves with
the actual Hiroshima memoirs of the fifties and sixties, as well
as with Japanese postwar poetry in its specific articulations.
  What we need are not more &quot;authentic&quot;  and &quot;sensitive&quot;
witnesses to what we take to be exotic cultural and ethnic practices,
 but a willingness, on the part of poet as well as reader, to
look searchingly and critically at what is always already there.

apolitical family (a family living at a time when the government
ruled by decree and there were no opposition parties),  Hiroshima
essentially meant the loss of one's nearest and dearest (Hideko
Tamura lost her mother), and how the populace coped with that
loss.  The issues are not construed as &quot;political.&quot;
