<P>
 Arkadii, in the above passage, is Arkadii Dragomoschenko, the
remarkable Russian poet Lyn Hejinian has been translating for
the past decade or so, a poet she first met in 1983 when she accompanied
her  husband Larry Ochs and other members of the Rova Saxophone
Quartet on a tour to Moscow and Leningrad.  Few poetic journeys
of our time have proved to be more fruitful.  Dragomoschenko and
Hejinian have collaborated on a film script, a theater piece,
poems, and translations of each others' work;  they also organized,
in 1989, an international conference on avant-garde writers, 
the first such conference since the Russian Revolution.  The four
American poets who attended--Michael Davidson, Ron Silliman, Barrett
Watten, and Hejinian herself--wrote a collaborative account of
their trip called <I>Leningrad </I> (Mercury House, 1991),
in which their four alternating voices run together, the individual
poets &quot;distinguished only by the icons used as a visual key
to identify them: a formal element of the text as poem.&quot;
 The result makes for a fascinating collage travel-narrative,
tracking as it does the rapid unravelling of the Soviet Union,
as seen from a set of related, but quite different positions.
<P>
  Hejinian's own narrative in <I>Leningrad</I> sets the
stage for <I>Oxota </I>, subtitled <I>A Short Russian
Novel</I>,  a 3,780-line poem, written in the fourteen-line
stanza of Pushkin's <I>Evgeny Onegin</I>  and divided,
like <I>Onegin</I>, into eight books.<I> </I> <I>Oxota</I><I>
</I>is not only one of the most ambitious long poems of the nineties;
it is, I think, one of the very best--eloquent testimony that
despite all the gloomy journalistic predictions about the death
of poetry, and especially narrative poetry, in the Information
Age, there are still important stories to be told.  In <I>My
Life</I>  (first version 1980, second, 1987), Hejinian submitted
her own &quot;story&quot; to a new kind of simultaneous vision,
her girlhood experience intersecting that of &quot;everygirl's&quot;
in a series of deliciously comic and moving permutations.  In
<I>Oxota </I> (the title means &quot;the hunt&quot;), the
story broadens out to include a host of Russian and American characters,
but its mysteries--what it doesn't tell us-- make even greater
demands on the reader.  As Hejinian, following her Russian Formalist
mentors Viktor Shklovsky and Jurij Tinjanov, puts it, &quot;The
very idea of reference is spatial:  over here is word, over there
is thing at which the word is shooting amiable love-arrows,&quot;
 and thus &quot;the struggle between language and that which it
claims to depict or express&quot; is what determines the very
shape narrative takes.  &quot;Language discovers what one might
know, which in turn is always less than what language might say.&quot;
 
<P>
 But how, we might ask, do we reconcile the poetics of the language
movement with the demands of narrative?  If language games --paranomasia,
paragram, epigraphy--and syntactic dislocations abound, if the
reader can't even tell &quot;what's going on,&quot; how can <I>Oxota
</I> claim to be a novel?  And how can Hejinian's ruminations
on what she calls in <I>Leningrad</I> &quot;juxtaposition,
happenstance, double vision, vistas, and a flow of observations
and expectations kept in suspense,&quot;  bear comparison, parodic
or otherwise, to the great Russian epic poem <I>Evgeny Onegin</I>?
<P>
 As it happens, I brought along my copy of <I>Oxota</I>
 to India (my first visit), where much time was spent waiting
in local airports, sitting in countless crowded lounges or waiting
for take-off on small planes that were  invariably delayed and
often simply cancelled.   Even in these distracting circumstances,
I found, to my own surprise, that I couldn't put <I>Oxota </I>
down, and not because I couldn't wait to see what happened next,
for it is never clear, in this poem of dislocations, irruptions,
and veiled allusions, what is actually happening.  Rather,  I
read avidly because Hejinian's &quot;short Russian novel&quot;
actively engages us in the poet's own &quot;hunt&quot; for meaning,
for greater understanding of daily life in the Soviet Union, as
that life is perceived by the uninitiated but not quite innocent
American visitor.   What game, for example, is the sinister colonel
playing?  Why are &quot;they&quot; hunting for Gavronsky and what
crime, if any, did he commit?  Is &quot;Lyn&quot; falling in love
with Arkadii or is theirs primarily a literary friendship?  How
does Arkadii's wife Zina view the situation?  Are specific events
described &quot;real&quot; or experienced in dreams?  What is
it that &quot;Lyn&quot; learns about herself?  And, on a more
pedestrian level, does the terrible freeze ever let up?  Are certain
images signs of spring or just momentary changes in the weather?
 Each fourteen-line stanza seems to promise disclosure of these
and other &quot;realities&quot; but the disclosure never quite
comes, even though we notice a gradual transformation in phenomenology:
 something, we know, is changing, being digested, increasingly
understood; some of the initial strangeness of the Russian world
is gradually diminishing even if it never quite disappears.
<P>
 What, asks John Bayley in his introduction to Charles Johnston's
translation of <I>Evgeny Onegin</I> (Penguin Classics),
did Pushkin mean by calling his poem &quot;a free novel&quot;?
 &quot;Apparently a work of art which did not conform to the rules
of a single genre, but which, as he put it in the stanza that
opened the poem by way of a preface, offered 'a collection of
parti-coloured chapters half-funny, half-sad, ideal and folk-simple'
(<I>prostonarodny</I>).&quot;   And Bayley cites Shklovsky,
who said that Pushkin's real subject was not the story of his
lovers, Eugene and Tatyana, &quot;but a game with this story.&quot;
 Like the Byron of <I>Don Juan</I>, Pushkin's &quot;I&quot;
 is the poem's central character, providing ironic commentary,
judging his characters' behavior, and digressing on larger social
and political themes.  At the same time, the poem's playfulness
is kept in check by the fixity of its stanza form: fourteen lines
of octosyllabic verse, rhyming <I>ababccddeffegg</I>. 

<P>
 The appeal this particular equilibrium evidently held for Hejinian
is spelled out most fully in chapters 192 and 193 of <I>Oxota.</I>
 The latter begins:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT SIZE=2>Evgeny Onegin</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> 
is a novel of manners (Belinsky called it encyclopedic), a family
saga,  an autobiography, an aimless plot with the symmetry of
time, an impression of  philosophy, and <I>Dead Souls</I>
 is an epic, hopeful of resurrection</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>The epic, said Mikhail Kheraskov, will remember important,
memorable, famous events  occurring in this world to cause important
change, or it will sing of events  occurring in a certain state
to glorify life, or occasion peace, or finally to  provoke a transition
to a different condition</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here is the paradox Hejinian embodies in <I>Oxota</I>.
 <I>Dead Souls</I>  is written in prose but its domain
is that of epic; <I>Onegin</I> is<I> </I>in verse, but
it is more properly understood as a novel of manners or autobiography.
 One needn't choose one or the other  (&quot;Equally marvelous,
as Gogol said, are the lenses that contemplate a star and those
that study a bug&quot;), but Hejinian's personal predilection
is for the freedom of the Pushkin model: &quot;Every fact could
break through deterministic constraints,&quot; and moreover &quot;Everyone
has to eat and many eat potatoes, but some of those also eat pineapples.&quot;
<P>
 How, then, to adapt such an outwardly formal model? &quot;Once
in Moscow,&quot; the poet recalls in chapter 149, &quot;I was
asked to recite and the man was antagonized,&quot;  evidently
by the absence of meter and rhyme in her poems.   But &quot;Even
'it' is irregular,&quot; she responds,  referring both to <I>Evgeny
Onegin</I>. and to the word &quot;it,&quot; with its myriad
uses.  &quot;There are irregularities for all that's permitted
/ Or I see it backward / Or it has its choice of contemporary
resemblance.&quot;  What such &quot;contemporary  resemblance&quot;
might look like is suggested in #192, which opens as follows:
 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>But to return to the theme of the novel and poetry</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>That is, one theme</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The time comes when each individual poem reveals
not only its own internal connections  but also spreads them out
externally, anticipating the integrity each poem  requires in
order to explain obscure points, arbitrary elements, etc., which,
if  they were kept within the limits of the given text, would
seem otherwise to be  mere examples of the freedom of expression</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If we read <I>Oxota </I> as a self-enclosed text, its &quot;obscure
points&quot; and &quot;arbitrary elements&quot; will look like
&quot;mere examples of the freedom of expression.&quot;  But if
we pay attention, the poem &quot;reveals not only its own internal
connections but also spreads them out externally.&quot;  For Pushkin's
&quot;irregularities&quot; of story-telling, his countless digressions,
observations, interruptions, Hejinian substitutes the &quot;irregularity&quot;
of &quot;free verse,&quot;  but only within the limits of the
temporal and spatial frames provided by the original: the fourteen-line
stanza, the eight-book structure, the shift from Petersburg (Hejinian's
Leningrad) to the pastoral setting of Tatyana's country house,
and so on.  
<P>
  The resulting design resembles, as Hejinian herself notes, those
picture books where little figures are buried inside the outlines
of larger images, their detection presenting a challenging &quot;quandary
for children&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Things in the picture are hidden but once found one
can never not see them though to  someone's who's never looked
they're still out of sight, lost in the lines  (#209)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is precisely what happens to the reader of <I>Oxota</I>.
 &quot;Things... hidden,&quot; for example, the frequent references
to Pushkin--his house, his tomb, his lovers and habits of writing--and
the equally frequent allusions to the story motifs of <I>Onegin</I><I>
</I>-- Tatyana's sexually charged dream of meeting a bear in the
snow, the insomnia she and Eugene alternately experience, the
rivalry between Eugene and Lensky, and so on-- make <I>Oxota
</I> a kind of <I>roman &agrave; clef</I>, though not
in the usual sense of the word.  
<P>
 Consider the title <I>Oxota </I> (the hunt).   The first
overt explanation of its meaning comes near the end of the &quot;novel&quot;
in chapter 259:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>It's characteristic of a Russian novelist to reveal
some lack of</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  confidence in the relationship between words and
their things</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A chair but not sure what sits and what will match
it</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Noon freezing on the spot we don't remember</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each action hangs, inconsequentially, over objects</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>How many alternatives there must be</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>How many patient comparisons await fulfilling</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unextracted paradoxes, breathless empty ice streets,
anticipated catastrophes with</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> no one approaching, love not provided with intrigue</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It was Zina who called it <I>oxota</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The hunt</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here Hejinian refers obliquely to Roman Jakobson's famous distinction
between the metaphoric and metonymic poles of language, the former
(or figure of similarity) said to belong to poetry, the latter
(or figure of contiguity), more properly to realistic prose fiction.
  Postmodern poetry has challenged and undermined this opposition;
 the metonymic mode Jakobson associated with Tolstoy's and Chekhov's
fiction  has become prominent in lyric as well.  Then, too, theorists
from Lacan and Genette on down have been at pains to show that
Jakobson's sharp dichotomy between the two will not stand up to
scrutiny.  Metaphors can work metonymically and vice-versa; figures
of similarity and contiguity are always intertwined.     
<P>
 Hejinian, in any case, adapts the Jakobson model to her own purposes.
 In a 1988 lecture to the Kootenay School of Poetics at Vancouver,
she described her desire for a phenomenological &quot;description&quot;
that would avoid both &quot;after-the-fact realism, with its emphasis
on the world described (the objects of description)&quot; and
the &quot;organizing subjectivity (that of the perceiver-describer).&quot;
Description, she suggests, should be &quot;a method of invention
and of composition ... with a marked tendency toward effecting
isolation and displacement, that is, toward objectifying all that's
described and making it strange.&quot;  And she adds:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>If one posits descriptive language and, in a broader
sense, poetic language as a language of inquiry, with analogies
to the scientific methods of the explorers, then I anticipate
that the principal trope will be the metonym, what Roman Jakobson
calls &quot;association by contiguity&quot;. . . . Metonymy moves
attention from thing to thing; its principle is combination rather
than selection.  Compared to metaphor,  which depends on code,
metonym preserves context, foregrounds interrelationship.  And
again in comparison to metaphor which is based on similarity,
and in which meanings are conserved and transferred from one thing
to something said to be like it, the metonymic world is unstable.
. . . Comparing apples to oranges is metonymic.  </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here Hejinian stresses the instability rather than the supposed
realism of the metonymic world.  &quot;How many patient comparisons
await fulfilling,&quot; we read in chapter 259, &quot;Unextracted
paradoxes . . . anticipated catastrophes with no one approaching.&quot;
 And in chapter 258, &quot;The hunter knows the resource / The
hunter resorts / She doesn't think and then decide / She follows
word to word in words' design.&quot;  Whereas Pushkin's Tatyana
is &quot;hunted by love's anguish&quot; (bk. 3, 20), Hejinian's
&quot;describer-perceiver&quot; hunts among words and sentences
for clues and connections.  &quot;A woman is hunting for sleep,&quot;
we read in chapter153, &quot;but she is sleeping to hunt.&quot;
 Book 5, from which these lines are taken, was published separately
as <I>The Hunt</I>, and it abounds in images of pursuit
and pursuers, a &quot;hunt syntax&quot;  as it is called in chapter
248.  
<P>
 In &quot;The Formative Properties of Words&quot; (#135), Hejinian
gives us some idea of what such a &quot;hunt syntax&quot; involves:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>I cannot imagine a glass prose  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But I was losing interest in the phenomenology of
my dreams</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Daylight was thicker than it seemed-- with augmentation,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>     odor, air</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Where are words changed?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I</FONT>f the language of transparency, (a &quot;glass
prose&quot;) is inadequate, &quot;reality&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
does make its demands on the poet: &quot;Daylight was thicker
than it seemed-- with augmentation, odor, air.&quot;  And later
in the stanza:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>It's the principle of connection not that of causality
which saves us from a bad infinity</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The word <I>hunt</I>  is not the shadow of
an accident</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The postmodern narrative poem, these lines imply, cannot adopt
the language of transcendence (&quot;a bad infinity&quot;), nor
can its incidents and events unfold according to the laws of &quot;causality.&quot;
 Rather, the &quot;principle of connection,&quot; of metonymic
structuring that animates <I>Oxota </I> is designed to
produce what Hejinian calls an &quot;intervalic&quot; or &quot;unstable,&quot;
form, in keeping with the poem's destabilization of identity.

<P>
   From <I>Writing is an Aid to Memory</I>  (1978) and
the first version of <I>My Life</I> , to her recent long
metaphysical poem &quot;The Person,&quot; Hejinian has refused
all notions of the <I>self</I>  as &quot;some core reality
at the heart of our sense of being,&quot;  the still dominant
myth of the &quot;artist's 'own voice,' issuing from an inner,
fundamental, sincere, essential irreducible, consistent self,
an identity which is unique and separable from all other human
identities.&quot;  In Russian, she points out, &quot;the closest
representation of my notion of the self occurs in (but only in)
the reflexible pronoun <I>sebya </I> (oneself, myself),
which never appears in the nominative case and is most frequently
seen in form of the suffix <I>sya </I> at the end of reflexive
verbs.  This suggests that when speaking Russian a self is felt
but has no proper name, or that the self occurs only in or as
a context but is insufficiently stable to occur independently
as a noun.&quot; 
<P>
 This explanation of Russian reflexive verb forms is somewhat
fanciful:  from Pushkin to Pasternak, after all, Russian poetry
has displayed a very strong sense of personal identity, even if
there is no single word that defines selfhood.  Just the same,
this particular peculiarity of Russian grammar helps Hejinian
articulate her own view that &quot;The person ... is a mobile
(or mobilized) reference point; or to put it another way, subjectivity
is not an entity but a dynamic&quot; (PJ 167).  &quot;Certainly,&quot;
Hejinian concedes, &quot;I have an experience of being in position,
at a time and place, and of being conscious of this, but this
position is temporary, and beyond that, I have no experience of
being except in position.&quot;  And again, &quot;[The] sense
of contingency is ultimately intrinsic to my experience of the
self, as a relationship rather than an existence&quot; (PJ 167)
<P>
 What this means in practice is that ideas, sensations, overheard
remarks, and so on, are <I>seen</I> from a  particular
perspective but these perspectives never wholly cohere into anything
like a fixed identity or self. We come to know the way Hejinian's
language works--her stylistic choices are highly particularized
-- but we learn little about the poet's past or present circumstances,
and it would be difficult to say that she has such-and-such attributes
and character traits, or to comment on her <I>nature</I>.
   Psychology, in this scheme of things, means, not self-revelation
but, in Wallace Stevens's words, &quot;description without place,&quot;
 the anchor being the buried but ever present analogy to <I>Evgeny
Onegin</I>.  Here is Chapter One:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>This time we are both</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>There, just with a few simple words it is possible

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is so because often men and women have their sense

<P>
In good epic tradition,  the poem opens in medias res with &quot;This
time,&quot; the implication being that &quot;this time&quot; (arriving
again in the Soviet Union?) will be measured against another time
which was somehow different.  But &quot;This time we are both&quot;
immediately displays Hejinian's deceptive flatness : the language
seems totally ordinary, and yet it throws out any number of plot
lines.  Perhaps it means that &quot;We are both here,&quot; but
then who are &quot;we&quot;?  And what is it we both are?  Both
poets, one American, one Russian, or one woman and one man?  Both
guests of the Soviet government?   Both ready for a relationship?
 Or, if &quot;both&quot; is construed, not as the predicate nominative
but as the modifier of the predicative adjective(s), we might
read it as &quot;both tired and hungry, both frightened and elated,
 and so on.
<P>
 Something, in any case, is about to happen &quot;this time.&quot;
The &quot;thaw&quot; of line 2 may well refer to the brief political
respite of the Khrushchev years as well as the actual weather
conditions;  soon  &quot;everything [is] set again in snow.&quot;
 And just as Pushkin's dedicatory stanza  describes his poem 
as the product &quot;of carefree hours, of fun, / of sleeplessness,
faint inspirations,&quot;  Hejinian refers to &quot;insomnia&quot;
and &quot;apathy,&quot;  warning her reader even as she warns
herself that &quot;We must learn to endure the insecurity as we
read / The felt need for a love intrigue / There is no person--he
or she was appeased and withdrawn.&quot;  The &quot;need for a
love intrigue&quot; refers, of course, to the Onegin-Tatyana romance
which is Pushkin's &quot;subject&quot;;  in our own fractured
world, such &quot;love intrigue&quot; seems to have given way
to the diminished romance of &quot;relationship,&quot; and even
then a relationship that &quot;lacks simplicity.&quot;  Indeed,
all sorts of sexual and familial relationships, all more or less
complicated, will be presented for our inspection, and part of
the fun of reading <I>Oxota</I>  will be to figure out who is
drawn to whom, for how long, and what the sexual and /or political
dynamics are.  
<P>
 In the meantime, the stage is set for the unfolding of events:
 &quot;People are very aggressive and every week more so,&quot;
where the reference to &quot;week&quot; is a play on the standard
complaint that &quot;Things get worse every day!&quot;  The &quot;duckfooted&quot;
colonel, who will appear and reappear throughout the narrative,
an embodiment of &quot;principles,&quot; and &quot;sentimental&quot;
old truths, is introduced and then, like a stock character in
a cheap thriller, mysteriously disappears again.  And now the
stanza ends on a turn of phrase that is brilliantly deployed throughout
<I>Oxota</I><I>, </I>especially in the early chapters,
where the poet records how it feels to be a linguistic alien in
a country one wants so badly understand.   &quot;Here is a small
piece of the truth-- I am glad to greet you&quot; is the poet's
rendition of the way &quot;polite&quot; Russian hosts greet their
American guests, the excessive formality of phrasing being a function
of unfamiliarity rather than good manners.   
<P>
 Many of us have had the experience of meeting foreigners who
seem extremely, if not excessively polite until we realize they
are speaking a careful English based on the classroom model or
grammar book.  Translated into colloquial English, line 12 carries
something like the locution, &quot;Believe me, I am really happy
to meet you.&quot;  But in bringing &quot;the truth&quot; into
speech twice, and in concluding that &quot;It is so because often
men and women have their sense of honor,&quot; we are immediately
<I>in</I> a language world--and, in Wittgensteinian terms,
the limits of my language are the limits of my world--that is
largely alien to the American visitor.  Accordingly, for the &quot;we&quot;
who are &quot;both,&quot; assimilation will depend, not on finding
out what the words mean, but how they are used, how to read the
signs.  And, as Hejinian wittily implies throughout, this is no
easy matter.  When someone says to us &quot;There, just with a
few simple words it is possible to say the truth,&quot; we surmise
the presence of a sensibility that may not be there at all.
<P>
 But then words like &quot;there&quot; are always suspect in Hejinian's
scheme of things, origin and location, whether of speech or event,
 being all but impossible to define.  As in Ingeborg Bachmann's
poetic novel <I>Malina</I>,  individual phrases and sentences
(whether thoughts or portions of dialogue) are often not assigned
to a particular subject: a phrase like &quot;People are very aggressive
and every week more so,&quot; for instance, sounds like a snatch
of conversation overheard while waiting on line at the butcher
shop.   But it may also refer to something quoted from the newspaper
or, for that matter, it may record Lyn's own appraisal of her
surroundings.  Even the stilted Russian constructions of the English
language cannot always be attributed to X or Y;  often, they may
be Hejinian's own, as she tries to make herself understood to
those who have schoolbook English.  They may even be approximations
of Russian syntax, as laboriously translated into  English by
the poet.  The pattern is further complicated by the gaps between
statements and/or lines, one perception thus failing to lead,
as Charles Olson would have it, immediately (or even remotely)
to a further perception.   
<P>
 Yet Hejinian's disjunctiveness does not go together with an imagistic
or filmlike verbal surface, or even with the free association
of stream-of-consciousness.  Language does not represent &quot;thought&quot;;
on the contrary, linguistic artifice is emphasized by the embedding
of images in a network of abstractions, as in &quot;everything
set again in snow,&quot; or by the positioning of abstractions
in unlikely grammatical constructions, as in the locution &quot;At
insomnia, at apathy,&quot; on the model of &quot;at school&quot;
or &quot;at home.&quot;  The resulting poem-novel is, as Hejinian
puts it in Chapter Two, &quot;something neither invented nor constructed
but moving through that time as I experienced it unable to take
part personally in the hunting.&quot;   It is as if the text avoids
the requisite distance between subject and object and lets &quot;events&quot;
unfold so that the reader feels as if she has come in on a conversation
whose participants cannot be located.  There is nothing obscure
about what's being said or thought, but we don't know who is doing
the thinking or talking. <I>Oxota</I> is thus a &quot;novel&quot;
 in which we have any number of actions and events but can't quite
tell who the actors are.  We only know that there are many and
that their lives sharply intersect Lyn's own.
<P>
 Book I might be called, in oblique homage to Gertrude Stein's
<I>Tender Buttons</I>  (about which Hejinian has written
so interestingly in &quot;Two Stein Talks&quot;), &quot;Rooms.&quot;
 The first preoccupation of the American guest is to become accustomed
to her immediate surroundings.  In chapter three:

<P>
&quot;Metonymy moves attention from thing to thing.&quot;  The
first few lines chart the poet's &quot;night thoughts&quot; as
she tries to acclimate herself to her new sleeping quarters in
Arkadii's drawing room, where she occupies &quot;the sofa called
America,&quot; so-called, no doubt, because it's where visiting
Americans are put up.   As she tries to make out the &quot;something&quot;
hanging on the wall, which looks like a &quot;painted herring,&quot;
two comic riddles come to mind: the popular Jewish joke about
the green herring, and the more personal &quot;riddle depending
on delayed recognition of a thing like a herring-Armenian&quot;--a
comic reference to the attempt, evidently by the Russian immigration
officials, to pronounce the name &quot;Hejinian,&quot; which,
further and confusingly, is assumed by them to be &quot;A maiden
name.&quot;   &quot;I answered the top man at the consulate and
said the word was marital.&quot;   A name can be marital (&quot;Hejinian&quot;
is the name of the poet's first husband)  but an undesignated
word can't, the phrasing pointing up the disparity between the
two kinds of words.   Then, too, &quot;marital,&quot; followed
as it is by the word &quot;Rubble,&quot; becomes, by the merest
reversal of its fourth and fifth letters (incidentally, a very
common typographical error), <I>martial</I>, the word making
perfect sense in the context of the language of war and imprisonment
that dominates the stanza.
<P>
 Such linguistic play is at the heart of what Hejinian calls 
&quot;Description as a method of invention and of composition.&quot;
 The conventional autobiographical travel narrative, whether in
verse or prose, would talk <I>about</I>  alienation and
the difficulty of communication.  <I>Oxota, </I>by contrast,
allows the language itself to generate the ideas.  Thus, when
Hejinian refers to the dream of &quot;walking somewhere in the
Crimea with my mother when we met two soldiers and their man in
handcuffs,&quot; and concludes, &quot;He was a criminal of passion,&quot;
 the reader is initially confused.  People everywhere commit &quot;crimes
of passion&quot; but what does it mean to <I>be</I>  a
&quot;criminal of passion&quot;?   The mystery is partially cleared
up when Arkadii refers, in the stanza's final line, to the Soviet
practice of putting people in camps on trumped up charges of sexual
offense:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>The old women who survived had to have been witches,
said Misha</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bitches, said Arkadii Trofimovich--the crime of passion
is our Soviet kindness</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the phrase &quot;crime of passion&quot; that haunts the
narrator, reappearing in her dream as a visual image of a &quot;man
in handcuffs,&quot; who is identified, as if for life, as a &quot;criminal
of passion.&quot;   The simple nominal shift from deed to doer
serves to define the Soviet system more tellingly than might a
didactic account of the camps.  The word, for Hejinian thus plays
a constructive rather than a representational role; it is itself
the creator of the images we claim to &quot;see.&quot;
<P>
<B> </B>What is it that we &quot;see&quot; in the course of the
poem?<B>  </B>The events depicted in <I>Oxota </I> are
characterized by their dailiness:  people shop, cook dinner, talk
endlessly about their feelings and (since these are poets) about
art and literature, make love, suffer from occasional insomnia,
complain about the weather, try to inure themselves to daily economic
and political upheavals,  and so on.  But &quot;if &quot;everything
happens so often, that speaking of it makes no sense&quot; (#89),
the poet must find ways of re-presenting those happenings so that
their actual feel, their texture is re-experienced.   Take Hejinian's
strategy of opening a &quot;chapter&quot; (stanza) with an aphorism
or wise generalization:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
 <FONT SIZE=2>Neither art nor life is opposite  (#39)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> All tender winds are foreseen tunes  (#45)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Truth is not precision but evidence (#71)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Passion is the alienation that love provides (#75)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Metaphor hides the paranoia of writing (#103)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Divination by clouds must be renounced under a colorless
sky (#135)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Does this last statement mean that if the sky were blue, &quot;Divination
by clouds&quot; should be practiced?  Does the relation of &quot;truth&quot;
to &quot;evidence&quot; rather than &quot;precision&quot; mean
that the truth mustn't be exact?  These Dada versions of proverbial
wisdom prefigure the narrator's overwhelming sense of difference,
confronted by the Other which is Russia.  &quot;Dreams don't understand,
they're what's being understood,&quot;  begins Chapter Twenty-One,
evidently playing on an earlier discussion of the power of dreams
to interpret (&quot;understand&quot; in Russian-English speak)
reality.  The stanza continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>A commentator in the kitchen on television gives
the official explanation that the reason</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> there's no food in the stores is that people are
eating too much</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But the television is only a three-inch square</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Rice with horseradish and bread</FONT>
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>She had previously enraged a group of the enormous
courtyard crows</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  A face they heard. . . .</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here  the comparison of apples and oranges Hejinian made in her
lecture on &quot;Strangeness&quot; is apposite. The authority
of the television is undercut by the absurd premise that its three-inch
screen is too small to convey truth, much smaller, at any rate,
than the reality that there is nothing for dinner but &quot;Rice
with horseradish and bread.&quot;  And if there is not enough
food there might as well, again by the logic of the absurd, be
flowers, in this case daffodils, whose wilted petals need to be
taped erect.  The anger that should be directed at the economy
that produces chronic food shortages is now vented on &quot;a
group of the enormous courtyard crows&quot;; the &quot;face they
heard,&quot; is Zina's, her mouth evidently open in a scream.
 As for the &quot;I&quot; who witnesses these events, she recalls
feeling &quot;slightly exposed&quot; (on the aggressive hunt for
food in the markets), &quot;but as a child does out of bed,&quot;
which is to say a naughty child which has sneaked out of its room
when it's supposed to be asleep.  &quot;Slightly exposed&quot;
perhaps also, in that Zina may suspect the malaise she feels in
these hospitable but still wholly alien surroundings.
<P>
 Throughout this chapter, indeed throughout <I>Oxota</I>,
 catachresis (e.g., &quot;A face they heard&quot;) emphasizes
the difficulties of perception, even as  incorrect usage (&quot;She
had previously <I>enraged </I> a group of . . . crows&quot;)
calls attention to the constructedness of this poetic discourse.
  Even repetition serves to point up difference: the spread at
Misha's party  (chapter 21, lines 12-14), for example,  is as
meatless as the dinner at Zina's, but this time  &quot;potatoes
with mushrooms, two different cabbage salads ... bread&quot; are
enhanced by wine and vodka, so that the conversation proceeds
enjoyably enough &quot;in stages of anecdote,&quot;  despite the
&quot;poor dog with pecked eyes&quot; and, again, the crows.
<P>
 The crows, like so many of the &quot;characters&quot; in <I>Oxota,</I>
 reappear frequently--in this case, as emblems of a loving but
slightly squalid and even oppressive domesticity.  In chapter
58, for example,  the poet has evidently been taken ill and is
being nursed by Zina and her son Ostap, while Arkadii attends
a poetry meeting in a neighboring town.  &quot;Some possibilities
take place on a plate,&quot; the stanza begins, the &quot;possibilities&quot;
probably referring to something Lyn ate that has made her sick.
 Such food poisoning is &quot;A process whose pace doesn't coincide
with comprehension's pace.&quot;  One can be told over and over
again not to eat X or Y (&quot;I remember the instructions&quot;)
but when the plate of food actually appears, one forgets: &quot;To
see is such deferred.&quot;  Someone, in any case (Ostap?  Zina?
 Or maybe Lyn herself?) declares, &quot;I am to interrupt myself
tonight at exactly 8 and propose a toast to our colleagues who
at this moment are reading verses in Tambov.&quot;  And the toast
is followed by the line &quot;Both largeness and lozenge to collide.&quot;
Now the scene shifts to the crows:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>The crows voices in winter light like copper pliers</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The reading an open word shutter</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Only slats, and they faded into winter. . . .</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here constriction is the order of the day.  To the feverish patient
sucking on lozenges, the crows' voices &quot;light&quot; (i.e.,
&quot;alight&quot; but &quot;light&quot; can also be an adjective),
grating on the ear &quot;like copper pliers,&quot;  but the poetry
reading itself appears to her as &quot;an open word shutter,&quot;
a closure of something that should remain free.  Meanwhile, she
is confined in the apartment, the &quot;slats,&quot; now of the
window shutters, &quot;fad[ing] into winter&quot; as night comes
on.  In this landscape, Hejinian's crows, rather like Wallace
Stevens's blackbirds, &quot;mark the edge of one of many circles.&quot;
 Later, when the spring thaws come (chapter 64), the crows give
way to the &quot;mumbling as of wasps or sheep,&quot; and &quot;I
said that a fly had appeared in the operating room / It sat like
a crystal of black salt on the bed.&quot;
<P>
 Book I (Chapters One to Seventy) circles around these images
and themes, the changes that take place, both seasonal and personal,
being so gradual as to be almost imperceptible.  Book 2 (71-80)
 has a different rhythm.  For one thing, each of its ten poems
has a title:  in sequence, &quot;Truth,&quot; &quot;Nature,&quot;
&quot;Innocence,&quot; &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; &quot;Passion,&quot;
&quot;Design,&quot; &quot;Suffering,&quot; &quot;Betrayal,&quot;
&quot;Death,&quot; and &quot;Redemption.&quot;  All of these conceptul
abstractions relate to the romance of Onegin and Tatyana,  the
 initial passion the &quot;innocent&quot; girl living in the country
conceives for him, Lensky's death in the duel,  Onegin's betrayal,
Tatyana's suffering, and  then, in the stunning reversal, Onegin's
own suffering, which looks ahead to death and perhaps redemption.
 Not only, then, does Pushkin provide Hejinian with a frame for
this section; book 2also contains many references to him, to his
house (now a museum), his tomb, his admirers, his mistresses,
and to imaginary scenes in which Pushkin may be lying &quot;naked
in his room on the rug writing in solitude or visiting with friends.&quot;
<P>
 But it is not just a matter of chapter titles or Pushkin references.
 The mood of book 2 is quite different from that of book 1.  The
parties, conversations, meals, and poetry debates give way to
solitude in nature although the setting is not made clear.  The
weather has changed (&quot;The frost falls from a tree&quot;;
&quot;gray birches&quot;), and although there are still occasional
snowfalls, the air is warmer.  The sequence opens with the line
&quot;Truth is not precision but evidence&quot;;  the body, it
seems has its own truth 
<P>
(&quot;Body and truth at the thought / Crazy who says no longer&quot;)
and the poet, formerly so upbeat, so busily engaged in exploring
her new territory, now appears (when she appears at all, for her
identity is increasingly fractured), troubled and somehow guilty:
&quot;I was feeling an inferior weariness, an inability to acknowledge
anything.&quot;  At the middle of the sequence (Chapter Seventy-Five&quot;),
is the elliptical poem called &quot;Passion&quot;:<BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Passion is the alienation that love provides</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Drifting winter tinted where we lifted, plowed</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Jealousy is a flake of a different passion</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It was hungry to be plunging in disruption</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The wobble and mattering the sensing muscles which

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>People are not joined in passion but divulged</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>They diverge--but that sight was unseen</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But all is muffled in banalities, I said</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is not passion to nod in</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is passion for no one to listen</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One with closed eyes and the other one's opened</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The snowfall offered all the colors of apple</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There was passion in its thud and exhileration</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Patience itself pushes over--given a body for what</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The language of this curious love poem is chaste in comparison
to the earlier exuberant stanzas; sound repetition (the assonance,
for example, of &quot;Drifting winter tinted where we lifted&quot;)
and the repetition  of the word &quot;passion&quot; (it occurs
five times in the space of fourteen lines) chiming with other
nouns ending with the &quot;-ion&quot; suffix (&quot;alienation,&quot;
&quot;disruption,&quot; &quot;exhileration&quot;), give the poem
a formal air.  At the same time, the sexual allusions (&quot;Drifting,&quot;
&quot;lifted,&quot; &quot;plowed,&quot; &quot;plunging,&quot;
&quot;The wobble and mattering of the sensing muscles which combine&quot;)
have a slightly histrionic tone--like bowdlerized Meredith or
slightly souped-up Rossetti--so that one is not surprised to read
&quot;But all this is muffled in banalities, I said.&quot; Banalities
like &quot;The snowfall offered all the colors of apple,&quot;
with its allusion to forbidden fruit.
<P>
 We never know much more about the poem's &quot;love intrigue&quot;
than this.  The focus is not on the lovers as individuals but
again on the <I>feel</I>  or texture of &quot;love.&quot;
In <I>Oxota,</I>  it seems to lead to frustration:  &quot;Suffering&quot;
(chapter 77) begins:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>A stench left from cooking fish lay frenzied, fell
inert</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Or a yellow rose frustrated in the Summer Garden</FONT>
<P>
And  &quot;Death&quot; (chapter 79) ends on a note of regret:
&quot;Why not have waited.&quot;  Only in the final chapter &quot;Redemption,&quot;
does the mood shift once more: a certain serenity now colors the
atmosphere:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We were laughing at the Russian novel</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We will say, the slower you go the farther you'll
get and plain water is glad to get a crow</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We will be redeemed, we will be rescued</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We will believe everything we say</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 The image of the &quot;crow,&quot; associated with the family
scenes of Book I, marks a return to what is usually called &quot;reason,&quot;
a return at least to the desire for something different: &quot;We
will be redeemed, we will be rescued.&quot;  And by the time we
open Book III and read the pseudo-epic and punning lines, &quot;Leningrad
lies in the haze of its sides / It lies as a heroine&quot; (chapter
81),  we are back in a more public space, where the &quot;I&quot;
functions as visiting poet and foreign observer.  
<P>
 &quot;You will start with the third chapter, Arkadii said.&quot;
 In this opening stanza of the third book, Hejinian gives us what
is perhaps the poem's clearest statement of poetics.  After the
opening gesture toward Leningrad, we read:  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Now it is both</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>How not-- the not is sometimes impossible to reach</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It was</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Then from a great disturbance</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By insisting on a comprehension of every word I am

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>So I must oppose the opposition of poetry to prose</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just as we can only momentarily oppose control to</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> discontinuity, sex to organization, disorientation

hunt</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In the short compass of a single stanza, Hejinian traces her own
response to Romanticism and its offshoot, the New Criticism. 
 One's first poetic model, she posits, is the Faustian lyric of
yearning, whose &quot;not is sometimes impossible to reach,&quot;
a model that easily gives way to the doctrine of the poem as formal
artifact (&quot;not an act but an object of memory&quot;), together
with the New Critical doctrine (made famous by I. A. Richards)
of poetic tension and resolution:  &quot;Then from a great disturbance
/ The most delicate message accumulates.&quot;  Perhaps Hejinian
calls her poem a &quot;novel&quot; so as to avoid the heavy weight
of lyric tradition.  &quot;It's not to displace anything,&quot;
for of course her text isn't like a novel either: &quot;It has
context and metronome,&quot;  a network of interrelated images
and realistic settings together with a strong verse line that,
if not guided by the metonome, is not innocent of rhythm and metrical
tradition either:  &quot;Leningrad lies in the haze of its sides,&quot;
for that matter, is a ten-syllable line having only four strong
stresses in the tradition of Eliot's <I>Waste Land</I>
 or <I>Four Quartets</I>. 
<P>
 But it is the long twelfth line that is especially revealing:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>By insisting on a comprehension of every word I
am free to signify place though not to   represent it </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once writing is no longer regarded as the vehicle that conveys
an already present speech, every word, indeed every morpheme can
be seen to carry meaning, to enter relationships with its neighbors.
 There are, in this scheme of things, no &quot;fillers&quot; or
function words, and syntax is at least as important as the invention
of striking images.  And here the distinction between &quot;signify[ing]
place&quot; and &quot;represent[ing] it&quot; becomes clear. 
The rejection of <I>representation </I> does not, as many
readers have assumed, entail the loss of <I>reference</I>.
 A Hejinian stanza, that is to say, does not present us with a
coherent picture of something external to it,  a photograph <I>of</I><I>
 </I>or picture <I>of.</I>  But reference, whether to persons
(Zina, Olga, Natasha, Vodonoy, Alexei, Arkadii, Gavronsky) or
places (cities, rivers, streets, houses) is essential to the poem,
the necessary peg upon which speculation can take place.  
<P>
  A frequent objection of mainstream poetry criticism is that,
without some measure of <I>representation</I>-- the mirror
held to nature, to social custom and the &quot;march of events--the
poetic text becomes meaningless.  But it is reference, not representation,
that we cannot do without:  words, after all, must point to something,
even if that something is only a small part of their structures
of meaning.   By the same argument,  the conventional opposition
of poetry to prose, an opposition still central to curricula,
literary journals, and critical discourse, must itself be opposed.
 For the long poems consonant with our times, Hejinian suggests,
cannot be pigeonholed;  the four or five-line strophes of <I>Oxota,</I>
 for example, are always approaching the condition of prose, without
ever quite becoming coherent sentences.   To illustrate the perils
of dichotomizing,  Hejinian concludes the stanza by comparing
that division to a series of others, by no means obviously analogous:
 
<P>
  poetry           prose
<P>
  control          discontinuity
<P>
  sex      organization
<P>
  disorientation   domestic time and space
<P>
  glasnost (information)  the hunt
<P>
 This opposition would make much more sense if we could switch
the items in the second pair: &quot;discontinuity&quot; would
seem to go with poetry and sex, and certainly with &quot;disorientation,&quot;
whereas &quot;control&quot; belongs to &quot;organization&quot;
and the order of prose.  &quot;Domestic time and space&quot; goes
here too because, for the woman poet, this is the space of &quot;organization,&quot;
where one takes care of others rather than oneself.  As for the
title noun, &quot;the hunt,&quot; the reference is to the relentless
power structure that pursues its recalcitrant victims, that forces
the person to obey certain laws.  If the information provided
by the new <I>glasnost</I> seems to provide the necessary
opening, such free inquiry may not be able to resist &quot;the
hunt&quot;--<I>Oxota</I>.
<P>
 At first the initiation into the Soviet order, an order softened
by <I>glasnost</I><I>  </I>and sweetened by the presence
of close friends and colleagues, provides amusement and pleasure;
somewhat later, sexual love and perhaps jealousy comes into the
picture to complicate matters.  But after the recognition in book
three (chapter 89) that &quot;names are relationships with a remarkable
economy while descriptions are profligate,&quot; a certain distancing
occurs.  &quot;Rested by winter&quot; (chapter108), the &quot;describer-perceiver&quot;
can enjoy the coming of spring with equanimity:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>And so in a truly magical manner it has come about
in</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> apparently one continuous morning that I have become
the possessor of  multitudes of wide open windows and of sunlight
tumbling into other minute  fissures of an almost invisible brightness
 (chapter 109)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &quot;Sex will begin again&quot; (chapter 111), but it is now
viewed with more detachment, with a greater sense of the absurd:
 &quot;sex is all feature and has no destiny / an enormous toe,
a dusty skin, breast hair.... At such an age the features fatten.&quot;
 When Lyn and Zina dawdle in the morning over their &quot;Cuban
grapefruit,&quot; they are &quot;very relaxed with sophistication&quot;
(chapter121). More comfortable with the &quot;person&quot; she
is becoming, Lyn is learning about the Russian avant-garde that
is so central to <I>Oxota:</I>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Lyosha, I said, please</FONT>

<P>
Here is one of those phrases that deliciously mimic Russian speech
trying to approximate English idiom.  &quot;With no indolence&quot;
means more or less &quot;I'd be happy to.&quot;  And Lyosha's
explanation is rendered with similar humor: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>But, for example--can one say that a huge sun is

<P>
Here Lyosha is making a case for the extravagant imagery of dada
and surrealism, suppressed during the long years of socialist
realism.  But the irony is that the American poet says &quot;It
would be very difficult' to use such imagery in English as well,
and the reference to 1985 refers not only to <I>glasnost</I>
 but quite possibly, as the stychomythia of the next lines suggests,
to the situation of poetry in the U.S., it being unclear which
of the two is speaking.
<P>
 Despite the principle of indeterminacy that operates here and
throughout, <I>Oxota</I> is nothing if not formally finished.
 Book 8 recycles the ten stanza titles of Book 2 (&quot;Truth,&quot;
&quot;Nature,&quot; &quot;Innocence&quot; ... ), but the content
is quite different.  &quot;Truth&quot; (Book 2) begins with the
line &quot;Truth is not precision but evidence,&quot; &quot;Truth&quot;
(Book 8) with the line, &quot;Truth is not a likeness-- not of
depicted sense.&quot;  &quot;Redemption&quot; in Book Two concludes
with the lines, &quot;We will be redeemed, we will be rescued
/ We will believe everything we say,&quot; whereas &quot;Redemption&quot;
(Book 8) is more resigned:

<FONT SIZE=2>Morning, morning-- nothing less</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It's real to the season-- the most passing</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just being there</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>And we will continue to acquire existence</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>And to confuse it</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We are both</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The last line brings us full circle to the opening of the poem,
&quot;This time we are both.&quot;  &quot;After something into
somewhere&quot;-- and much has  happened--&quot;they await each
other.&quot;  The &quot;love intrigue&quot; seems about to take
place, but, for the moment, &quot;Just being there&quot; is enough.
 Hejinian's coda slyly alludes to <I>Onegin'</I>s concluding
stanzas.  In book 8, chapter 49, Pushkin's narrator declares:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>Whatever in this rough confection</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> you sought-- tumultuous recollection,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>a rest from toil and all its aches,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>or just grammatical mistakes,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>a vivid brush, a witty rattle--</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>God grant that from this little book</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For heart's delight, or fun, you took</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>for dreams, or journalistic battle,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>God grant you took at least a grain.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This becomes, in Hejinian's counterstatement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Say a name and someone appears, someone without the
same name</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Then it's quiet</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We cross some distance in the pale pulverizations
of the rosy marsh</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mist on dusts of orange light, partial preparations</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We will find what we want</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Describer's hunter, narrator's hunt</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Half-visible, emerging, merged.....</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Pushkin's &quot;rough confection&quot; reappears in Hejinian's
&quot;pale pulverizations,&quot; but whereas the Russian poet
prays that &quot;God grant you took at least a grain&quot; from
&quot;this little book,&quot; Hejinian's narrator has fewer illusions:
&quot;We will find,&quot; she shrugs, &quot;what we want.&quot;
 And that, I take it, is precisely the way <I>Oxota</I><I>
</I>works.  Many readers, accustomed to the &quot;glass prose&quot;
of more user-friendly poems, will find its contrived corridors
impassable. Others like myself  will enter the &quot;Half-visible,
emerging, merged&quot; labyrinth  which is <I>Oxota</I><I>
</I> and find that the absence of designated exits is itself a
special pleasure.

3. &quot;The title, <U><I>Oxota</I></U>, Hejinian
explains, &quot;is a transliteration of a Russian word which could
be translated as <U><I>the hunt</I></U> or <U><I>hunting.</I></U>
It comes from a friend's characterization of herself as &quot;oxotnitsa,&quot;
the huntress (one of Artemis's epithets); she was referring to
the work of providing for daily life in conditions of worsening
shortages of food and basic goods and to the spirit in which people
have to hunt for them.&quot; See Hejinian, &quot;On <U><I>Oxota</I></U>:

5. In a letter to me (23 September 1992), Hejinian
remarks how drawn she is to &quot;the all-purpose, fluid, ambiguous,
forever serviceable It.... I find this pronoun and its usage fascinating,
because of its flexibility: 
<P>
It's raining tonight. What is?
<P>
It's a question of being accurate. What is?
<P>
It's okay to be confused in a foreign country. What
is it?&quot;<BR>
