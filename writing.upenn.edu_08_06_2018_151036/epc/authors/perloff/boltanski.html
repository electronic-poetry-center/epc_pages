<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000597" SIZE=+1>I begin with two photographs,</FONT>
  both of them family snapshots of what are evidently a young mother and
  her little boy in a country setting (figures 1 and 2). Neither is what
  we would call a &quot;good&quot; (i.e., well-composed) picture. True, the
  one on the left is the more &quot;expressive&quot; of the two, the anxious
  little boy clinging somewhat fearfully to his mother, whereas the impassive
  woman and child on the right look straight ahead at the camera.</P>
  <P>Here is a second pair of photographs, this time of class pictures (figures
  3 and 4). On the left, an end-of-the-year group photo of a smiling highschool
  class with their non-smiling male teacher in the first-row center; on the
  right, a more adult (postgraduate?) class, with their teacher (front row,
  third from the left) distinguished by his white hair, and smiling ever
  so slightly in keeping with what is evidently the collegial spirit of the
  attractive young group.</P>
  <P>Both sets may be used to illustrate many of the points Barthes makes
  about photography in <I>La Chambre claire</I>. First, these pictures are
  entirely <I>ordinary</I>--the sort of photographs we all have in our albums.
  Their appeal, therefore, can only be to someone personally involved with
  their subjects, someone for whom they reveal the <I>that-has-been</I> (<I>&ccedil;a
  a </I>&eacute;t&eacute;) which is, for Barthes, the essence or <I>noeme
  </I>of photography. &quot;The photographic referent,&quot; we read in #32,
  &quot;[is] not the <I>optionally</I> real thing to which an image or a
  sign refers but the <I>necessarily</I> real thing which has been placed
  before the lens, without which there would be no photograph. . . . in Photography
  I can never deny that <I>the thing has been there</I>.&quot;(CL 76). And
  again, &quot;The photograph is literally an emanation of the referent&quot;
  (80). In this sense, &quot;every photograph is a certificate of presence&quot;
  (87).</P>
  <P>But &quot;presence,&quot; in this instance, goes hand in hand with death.
  &quot;What the Photograph reproduces to infinity has occurred only once:
  the Photograph mechanically repeats what could never be repeated existentially&quot;
  (4). As soon as the click of the shutter has occurred, what is photographed
  no longer exists; subject is transformed into object, &quot;and even,&quot;
  Barthes suggests, &quot;into a museum object&quot; (13). When we look at
  a photograph of ourselves or of others, we are really looking at the return
  of the Dead. &quot;Death is the <I>eidos</I> of the Photograph&quot; (15).</P>
  <P>Christian Boltanski, whose photographs I have paired with two of the
  illustrations in <I>Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes</I> , shares Barthes's
  predilection for the ordinary photograph, the photograph of everday life.
  Like Barthes, he dislikes &quot;art photography,&quot; photography that
  approaches the condition of painting. For him, too, the interesting photograph
  is one that provides the viewer with the testimony that the thing seen
  <I>has been</I>, <I>that</I> <I>it is thus</I>. In Barthes's words, the
  Photograph is never anything but an antiphon of 'Look,' 'See,' 'Here it
  is'; it points a finger at certain <I>vis-&agrave;-</I>vis, and cannot
  escape this pure deictic language&quot;(5). But, as we shall see, in Boltanski's
  oeuvre, this pure deictic language, this pointing at &quot;what has occurred
  only once&quot; (4) takes on an edge unanticipated in the phenomenology
  of <I>Camera Lucida</I>. </P>
  <P>Consider the mother-and-child snapshots shown above. Both foreground
  the &quot;real&quot; referent of the image, the outdoor scene that the
  camera reproduces. But in what sense are the photographs &quot;certificates
  of presence&quot;? The photo on the left portrays Roland Barthes, aged
  five or six, held by his mother, who stands at some distance from a house
  (her house?) in a non-specifiable countryside. The mother's clothes and
  hairdo place the photograph somewhere in the twenties; the long-legged
  boy in kneesocks, shorts and sweater seems rather big to be held on his
  mother's arm like a baby. The caption on the facing page accounts for this
  phenomenon: it reads, &quot;The demand for love.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="boltanski_footnotes.html#1" TARGET="resource window">1</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>The photograph on the right is part of a work (similarly of the early
  1970s) called <I>Album de photos de la famille D., 1939-54</I>.--which
  depicts a &quot;family&quot; (are they a family?) Boltanski didn't know
  at all. He had borrowed several photo albums from his friend Michel Durand-Dessert
  (hence the <I>D</I> ), reshot some 150 snapshots from these albums and
  tried to establish their chronology as well as the identities of their
  subjects, using what he called an ethnological approach: for example, &quot;the
  older man who appeared only at festive occasions, must be an uncle who
  did not live in the vicinity.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="boltanski_footnotes.html#2"
  TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</FONT> But the sequence he constructed
  (e.g., figure 5) turned out to be incorrect: &quot;I realized,&quot; the
  artist remarked, &quot;that these images were only witnesses to a collective
  ritual. They didn't teach us anything about the Family D. . . . but only
  sent us back to our own past.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="boltanski_footnotes.html#3"
  TARGET="resource window">3</A>) </FONT>And, since the snapshots in the
  sequence date from the French Occupation, and its immediate aftrmath, the
  question arises: what was this bourgeois provincial family doing during
  the War? What, in short, is it that <I>has </I>been in the snapshot of
  the young woman and small boy, resting on a shady meadow? </P>
  <P>Similar questions are raised in the second Boltanski photograph above.
  Again, the two class pictures make an interesting pair. On the right, we
  have one of the &quot;<I>S</I> &quot; entries in <I>Roland Barthes by Roland
  Barthes</I>: a photograph of <I>le seminaire</I>, that is the Barthes seminar,
  taken some time in the 1970s. The caption reads: &quot;The space of the
  seminar is phalansteric, i.e., in a sense, fictive, novelistic. It is only
  the space of the circulation of subtle desires, mobile desires; it is,
  within the artifice of a sociality whose consistency is miraculously extenuated,
  according to a phrase of Nietzsche's: 'the tangle of amorous relations'&quot;(RB
  171). The &quot;real,&quot; &quot;referential&quot; photograph thus becomes
  an occasion for pleasurable erotic fantasy.</P>
  <P>In contrast, the other class photograph is a picture Boltanski came
  across by chance of the 1931 graduating class of the Lyc&eacute;e Chases
  (Gymnasium Chajes), the Jewish high school in Vienna, which was shut down
  shortly after this end-of-the-year group photograph was taken. If, as Barthes
  posits, the photograph is co-terminal with its referent, here the &quot;death&quot;
  of its subjects produced by the camera may well have foreshadowed their
  real death in the camps. In his 1986 installation <I>Lyc&eacute;e Chases
  </I>, Boltanski took this &quot;ordinary&quot; class photograph and enlarged,
  as if maing X-Rays, each of the smiling faces to the point where they resemble
  death masks (figures 6 and 7). Yet this version is no more &quot;real&quot;
  than the other, Boltanski never having learned what actually happened to
  these smiling students. When <I>Lyc&eacute;e Chases</I> was shown in New
  York in 1987, one of the students in the photograph, now a man in his late
  sixties, came forward and identified himself to Boltanski. But this Chases
  graduate, who had emigrated to the U.S. in the early thirties, knew nothing
  of the fate of the other students. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="boltanski_footnotes.html#4"
  TARGET="resource window">4</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>Every photograph,&quot; says Barthes, &quot;is somehow co-natural with
  its referent&quot; (76). But what is the referent of the Chases graduation
  picture? What &quot;evidential force&quot; does it possess and for whom?
  To tackle these questions, we might begin with the famed Winter Garden
  Photograph, the photograph whose <I>punctum</I> (the prick, sting, or sudden
  wound that makes a particular photograph epiphanic to a particular viewer)
  is so powerful, so overwhelming, so implicated in Barthes's anticipation
  of his own death, that he simply cannot reproduce it in <I>Camera Lucida</I>
  :</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>(I cannot reproduce the Winter Garden Photograph. It exists only for
    me. For you, it would be nothing but an indifferent picture, one of the
    thousand manifestations of the &quot;ordinary&quot;; it cannot in any way
    constitute the visible object of a science; it cannot establish an objectivity,
    in the positive sense of the term; at most in would interest your <I>studium</I>:
    period, clothes, photogeny; but in it, for you, no wound.) (73). </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Winter Garden Photograph thus becomes the absent (and hence more
  potent) referent of Barthes's paean to presence, a paean that takes the
  form of an elegiac <I>ekphrasis.</I></P>
  <P>&quot;One November evening, shortly after my mother's death,&quot; Barthes
  recalls, &quot;I was going through some photographs. I had no hope of 'finding'
  her. I expected nothing from these 'photographs of a being before which
  one recalls less of that being than by merely thinking of him or her'&quot;
  (63). And Barthes puts in parentheses following the quote, the name of
  the writer who is the tutelary spirit behind his own lyric meditation--Proust.
  Like the Proust of <I>Les Intermittances du coeur</I>, Barthes's narrator
  has learned to expect nothing. The mood is autumnal, sepulchral, and the
  image of the dead mother cannot be recovered--at least not by the voluntary
  memory. Different photographs capture different aspects of her person but
  not the &quot;truth of the face I had loved&quot; : &quot;I was struggling
  among images partially true and therefore totally false&quot; (66).</P>
  <P>As in Proust, the miraculous privileged moment, the prick of the <I>punctum</I>
  , comes when least expected. The uniqueness of the Winter Garden Photograph
  -- an old, faded, album snapshot with &quot;blunted&quot; corners-- is
  that it allows Barthes to &quot;see&quot; his mother, not as he actually
  saw her in their life together (this would be a mere <I>studium</I> on
  his part), but as the child he had never known in real life, a five-year
  old girl standing with her seven-year old brother &quot;at the end of a
  little wooden bridge in a glassed-in conservatory&quot; (67). We learn
  that brother and sister are united &quot;by the discord of their parents,
  who were soon to divorce&quot; (69). But in Barthes's myth, this little
  girl is somehow self-born. &quot;In this little girl's image I saw the
  kindness which had formed her being immediately and forever, without her
  having inherited it from anyone; how could this kindness have proceeded
  from the imperfect parents who had loved her so badly--in short, from a
  family?&quot; (69). In an imaginative reversal, the mother-as-child in
  the Winter Garden Photograph now becomes his child: &quot;I who had not
  procreated, I had, in her very illness, engendered my mother&quot; (72).
  The tomb-like glass conservatory thus becomes the site of birth. </P>
  <P>&quot;The unknown photographer of Chennevi&egrave;res-sur-Marne,&quot;
  Barthes remarks, &quot;had been a mediator of a truth&quot; (70)--indeed,
  of <I>the</I> truth; his inconsequential little snapshot &quot;achieved
  for me, utopically, <I>the </I>impossible science of the unique being&quot;
  (71). Impossible, because the uniqueness of that being is, after all, only
  in the eye of the beholder. Like Proust's Marcel, the Barthean subject
  must evidently purge himself of the guilt prompted by the unstated conviction
  that his own &quot;deviation&quot; (sexual or otherwise) from the bourgeois
  norms of his childhood world must have caused his mother a great deal of
  pain. Like Marcel, he therefore invents for himself a mother who was a
  perfect being, her goodness and purity deriving from no one (for family
  is the enemy in this scheme of things). Gentleness is all: &quot;during
  the whole of our life together,&quot; writes Barthes in a Proustian locution,
  &quot;she never made a single 'observation'&quot; (69). Thus perfected,
  the mother must of course be dead; the very snapshot that brings her to
  life, testifies as well to the irreversibility of her death.</P>
  <P>Barthes understands only too well that the <I>punctum</I> of this photograph
  is his alone. No one but Roland Barthes himself would read the snapshot
  as he does. The &quot;emanation of the referent&quot; which is, for him,
  the essence of the photograph, is thus an entirely personal connection.
  The intense, violent, momentary pleasure (<I>jouissance</I>) that accompanies
  one's reception of the photograph's &quot;unique Being&quot; is individual
  and &quot;magical,&quot; for unlike all other representations, the photograph
  is an image without a code (88), the eruption of the Lacanian &quot;Real&quot;
  into the signifying chain, a &quot;<I>satori</I> in which words fail&quot;
  (109).</P>
  <P>As an elegy for his mother, as well as a kind of epitaph for himself,
  <I>La Chambre claire</I> is intensely moving. But what about Barthes's
  insistence on the &quot;realism&quot; of the photograph, his conviction
  that it bears witness to <I>what-has-occurred-only-once</I>? &quot;From
  a phenomenoloigal viewpoint,&quot; says Barthes, &quot;in the Photograph,
  the power of authentication exceeds the power of representation&quot; (89).
  Authentication of what and for whom? Here Boltanksi's photographic representations
  of everyday life pose some interesting questions. Indeed, the distance
  between Barthes's generation and Boltanski's--a distance all the more remarkable
  in that such central Boltanski photo installations as <I>La Famille D</I>,
  <I>Le Club Mickey</I> , and <I>Detective</I> date from the very years when
  Barthes was composing <I>Roland Barthes par Roland Barthes</I>, <I>Fragment
  d'un discours amoureux</I>, and <I>La Chambre claire-</I>- can be measured
  by the revisionist treatment Boltanski accords to the phenomenology of
  authentication practiced by the late Barthes.</P>
  <P>Roland Barthes was born in the first year of World War I (26 October
  1915), Christian Boltanski in the last year of World War II, specifically,
  on the day of the liberation of Paris (6 September 1944)--hence his middle
  name <I>Libert&eacute;</I>. Barthes's Catholic father was killed in October
  1916 in a naval battle in the North Sea; the fatherless child was brought
  up in Bayonne by his mother and maternal grandmother in an atmosphere he
  has described as one of genteel poverty and narrow Protestant bourgeois
  rectitude. Boltanski's father, a prominent doctor, was born a Jew but converted
  to Catholicism; his wife, a writer was Catholic. To avoid deportation in
  1940, the Boltanskis faked a divorce and pretended the doctor had fled,
  abandoning his family, whereas in reality he was hidden in the basement
  of the family home, situated in the center of Paris, for the duration of
  the Occupation. The death of Barthes's father, an event his son understood
  early on as being only too &quot;real,&quot; may thus be contrasted to
  the simulated &quot;death&quot; of Dr. Boltanski at the time of his son's
  birth. Indeed, this sort of simulation, not yet a central issue in World
  War I when battle-lines were drawn on nationalistic rather than ideological
  grounds, became important in the time of the Resistance, when simulation
  and appropriation became common means of survival. Georges Perec, for example,
  a writer Boltanski greatly admires and frequently cites, was miraculously
  saved from the concentration camp in which his parents perished by being
  sent to the South of France on a Red Cross transport, his arm having been
  put in a sling as if he had been wounded. He was five years old.</P>
  <P>Under such circumstances, <I>authentication </I>becomes a contested
  term. How does one document <I>what-has-occurred-only-once</I> when the
  event itself is perceived to be a simulation? And to what extent has the
  experience of <I>studium</I> versus <I>punctum</I> become a collective,
  rather than the fiercely personal experience it was for Barthes? In a 1984
  interview held in conjunction with the Boltanski exhibition at the Centre
  Pompidou in Paris, Delphine Renard asked the artist how and why he had
  chosen photography as his medium. &quot;At first,&quot; he replied, &quot;what
  especially interested me was the property granted to photography of furnishing
  the evidence of the real [<I>la preuve du r&eacute;el</I>]: a scene that
  has been photographed is experienced as being true. . . . If someone exhibits
  the photograph of an old lady and the viewer tells himself; today, she
  must be dead, he experiences an emotion which is not only of an aesthetic
  order.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="boltanski_footnotes.html#5" TARGET=
  "resource window">5</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>Here Boltanski seems to accept the Barthean premise that the &quot;photographic
  referent&quot; is &quot;not the <I>optionally</I> real thing to which an
  image or a sign refers but the <I>necessarily</I> real thing which has
  been placed before the lens, without which there would be no photograph.
  . . . in Photography I can never deny that <I>the thing has been there</I>.&quot;
  But for Boltanski, this &quot;reasonable&quot; definition is not without
  its problems:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>In my first little book, <I>Tout ce qui reste de mon enfance</I> of
    1969, there is a photograph that supplies the apparent proof that I went
    on vacation to the seashore with my parents, but it is an unidentifiable
    photograph of a child and a group of adults on the beach. One can also
    see the photograph of the bed I slept in when I was five years old; naturally,
    the caption orients the spectator, but the documents are purposely false.
    . . . In most of my photographic pieces, I have utilized this property
    of the proof one accords to photography to expose it or to try to show
    that <I>photography lies, that it doesn't speak the truth but rather the
    cultural code</I>. (BOL 75, my emphasis).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Such cultural coding, Boltanski argues, characterizes even the most
  innocent snapshot (say, the Winter Garden Photograph). The amateur photograph
  of the late nineteenth century, for example, is based on a pre-existing
  image which is culturally imposed--an image derived from the painting of
  the period. The amateur photographer, he notes, &quot;shows nothing but
  images of happiness, lovely children running around on green meadows: he
  reconstitutes an image he already knows&quot; (BOL 76). Tourists in Venice,
  for example, who thinks they are taking &quot;authentic&quot; photographs
  of this or that place, are actually recognizing the &quot;reality&quot;
  only through the lens of a set of clich&eacute;s they have unconsciously
  absorbed; indeed they want these pictures to ressemble those they already
  know. So Boltanski makes an experiment. Together with Annette Messager,
  he produces a piece called <I>Le Voyage de noces &agrave; Venise</I> (1975),
  composed of photographs taken elsewhere (BOL 76). And in another book called
  <I>Dix </I>portraits photographiques de Christian Boltanski (1972, figure
  7), the temporal frame (the boy is depicted at different ages) is a pure
  invention; all the photographs were actually taken the same day, using
  different children. &quot;This little book,&quot; says the artist, &quot;was
  designed to show that Christian Boltanski had only a collective reality
  . . . [that of] a child in a given society&quot; (BOL 79).</P>
  <P>But Boltanski's is by no means a simple reversal of the Barthean <I>noeme</I>.
  For the paradox is that, again like Perec, there is nothing he finds as
  meaningful as the ordinary object, the trivial detail. Photography, for
  him, is a form of ethnography and he has often spoken of his early fascination
  with the displays in the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme, not so much the displays
  of imposing African sculpture but of the everyday objects--Eskimo fishhooks,
  Indian arrows from the Amazon valley, and so on:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>I saw large metal boxes in which there were little objects, fragile
    and without signification. In the corner of the case there was often a
    small faded photograph representing a &quot;savage&quot; in the middle
    of handling these little objects. Each case presented a world that has
    disappeared: the savage of the photograph was no doubt dead, the objects
    had become useless, and, anyway, no one knew how to use them any more.
    The Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme appeared to me as a great morgue. Numerous
    artists have here discovered the human sciences (linguistics, sociology,
    archeology); here there is still the &quot;weight of time&quot; which imposes
    itself on artists. . . Given that we have all shared the same cultural
    references, I think we will all finish in the same museum&quot; (BOL 71).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Does this mean that art discourse can be no more than a cultural index,
  that the individual art work no longer counts? On the contrary. For whereas
  Barthes posits that what he calls <I>the impossible science of unique being</I>
  depends upon a given spectator's particular reading of a photograph in
  itself perfectly &quot;ordinary,&quot; Boltanski enlarges the artist's
  role: it is the artist who creates those images that are &quot;imprecise
  enough to be as communal as possible&quot;-- images each viewer can interpret
  differently. The same holds true, so the artist posits, for captions, the
  ideal situation being one in which a picture from, say, an elementary-school
  history book every child has used is reproduced, bearing a caption like
  &quot;Ce jour-l&agrave;, le professeur entra avec le directeur&quot; (&quot;That
  day, the teacher entered with the principal)&quot; (BOL 79). </P>
  <P>One of Boltanski's favorite genres is thus the inventory. If many of
  his &quot;albums&quot; use &quot;fake&quot; photos to tell what are supposedly
  &quot;true&quot; stories, the <I>Inventar</I> series work the other way
  around. Here, for example, is the <I>Inventaire des objets ayant appartenus
  &agrave; un jeune homme d'Oxford</I> of 1973 (figures 8 and 9). Boltanski
  had read of the untimely death of an Oxford student and wrote to his landlord
  asking if all his personal effects, &quot;significant&quot; or otherwise,
  could be sent to him. In photographing these objects against a neutral
  background, everything takes on equal value: the Pope's photograph, a folded
  shirt, a set of pamphlets--whatever. The question the inventory poses is
  whether we can &quot;know&quot; someone through his or her things. If the
  clothes make the man, as the adage has it, can we recreate the absent man
  from these individual items? Or does the subject fragment into a series
  of metonymic images that might relate to anyone?</P>
  <P>Is there, in other words, such a thing as <I>identity</I>?</P>
  <P>Here again Barthes offers an interesting <I>point de rep&egrave;re</I>.
  One of the sections in <I>Barthes par Barthes</I> is called &quot;<I>Un
  souvenir d'enfance--</I> A memory of childhood,&quot; and goes like this:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>When I was a child, we lived in a neighborhood called Marrac; this neighborhood
    was full of houses being built, and the children played in the building
    sites; huge holes had been dug in the loamy soil for the foundations of
    the houses, and one day when we we had been playing in one of these, all
    the children climbed out except me--I couldn't make it. From the brink
    up above, they teased me: lost! alone! spied on! excluded! (to be excluded
    is not to be outside, it is to be <I>alone in the hole</I>, imprisoned
    under the open sky; <I>precluded</I>); then I saw my mother running up;
    she pulled me out of there and took me far away from the children--against
    them.&quot; (RB 121-22).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>We could obviously submit this text to a psychosexual reading and discuss
  how being &quot;<I>alone in the hole</I>&quot; and rescued by his mother
  &quot;against&quot; the other children prefigures Barthes's later linkings
  of the sexual and the textual. But here I want to stress something else:
  namely that Barthes does not question the existence of memory as a force
  that can bring back the past in its concrete, specific manifestations.
  The image of Marrac with its dangerous building sites is graphic as are
  the remembered emotions of fear, panic, and release. The &quot;souvenir
  d'enfance&quot; is just that: a short, imagistic, film-like narrative.
  However painful, memory relates past to present and creates the individual
  identity.</P>
  <P>But for those writers and artists, especially the Jewish ones, who came
  of age after the Second World War, the Proustian or Barthean <I>souvenir
  d'enfance</I> had become a kind of empty signifier. &quot;I have very few
  memories of childhood,&quot; Boltanski tells Delphine Renard, &quot;and
  I think I undertook this seeming autobiography precisely to blot out my
  memory and to protect myself. I have invented so many false memories, which
  were collective memories, that my true childhood has disappeared&quot;
  (BOL 79). This echoes Perec on the opening page of <I>W</I>: The memories
  have disappeared.<BR>
