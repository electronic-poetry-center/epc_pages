  <P><A NAME="2"></A><B>2.</B> According to Jed Rasula's very useful table
  of anthology appearances between 1945 and 1990, Wilbur is Number 1, his
  inclusion in seventy anthologies surpassing even the sixty-seven of Robert
  Lowell. See Rasula, <I>The American Poetry Wax Museum: Reality Effects,
  1940-1990</I> (Urbana: National Council of Teachers of English, 1996),
  p. 509. This text, subsequently cited as WM, is indispensable for anyone
  studying the poetics of the period. </P>

  recalled, &quot;and I wanted to get out of Switzerland. I didn't want to
  build my future there. The country was too closed, too small for me.&quot;
  Soon after his arrival in 1947, he wrote his parents, &quot;this country
  is really a free country. A person can do what he wants. Nobody asks to
  see your identification papers.&quot; See Martin Gasser, &quot;Zurich to
  New York: 'Robert Frank, Swiss, unobtrusive, nice. . .',&quot; in RF 46-47.</P>

  <P><A NAME="15"></A><B>15.</B> The art world was somewhat different. Robert
  Motherwell's <I>The Dada Painters and Poets</I> had been published by Wittenborn
  in 1951 and had a great influence on the New York painters themselves.
  But the literary little magazines moved on a different track.</P>

  <P><A NAME="18"></A><B>18. </B>O'Hara dated most of his manuscripts carefully.
  According to Donald Allen's notes for <I>The </I>Collected Poems of Frank
  O'Hara (1971; Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California
  Press, 1995), the poems on pages 239-64 all date from 1956. Among these,
  we find such key poems as &quot;To John Wieners,&quot; &quot;In Memory
  of my Feelings,&quot; &quot;Digression on <I>Number 1, 1948</I>,&quot;
  and &quot;Why I am not a Painter,&quot; as well as &quot;A Step Away from
  Them,&quot; which is discussed below. The <I>Collected Poems</I> is subsequently
  cited as FOH.</P>

  de Nagy Gallery in 1950 in an edition of 300 copies. For bibliographical
  information, See David K. Kermani, <I>John Ashbery: A Comprehensive Bibliography</I>
  (New York and London: Garland Publishing Company, 1976). In an unpublished
  interview of 1974, Ashbery gave Kermani an account of how Auden happened
  to award the Yale Younger Poets Prize to <I>Some Trees</I>, although, so
  Ashbery believes, he really didn't like it very much (see Kermani, p. 6).</P>
