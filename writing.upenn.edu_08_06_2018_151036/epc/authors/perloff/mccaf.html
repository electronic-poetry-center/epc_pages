<FONT FACE="Geneva"> &quot;The materiality of language,&quot;
Steve McCaffery has suggested in a 1978 essay on the poet bill
bissett, &quot;is that aspect which remains resistant to an absolute
subsumption into the ideality of meaning. . . . To see the letter
not as a phoneme but as ink, and to further insist on that materiality,
inevitably contests the status of language as a bearer of uncontaminated
meaning(s)&quot; (NI 105).  Consider the following scenario, provided
by Michael Coffey as an illustration of McCaffery's argument:

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Coffey comments: &quot;Each of these directional
episodes 'means' the same thing: proceed to the right to park
your car.  In that all three messages convey the same meaning,
the material differences in the composition are devalued, made
irrelevant.  Despite three entirely different modes of presentation
(graphic; lexical / phonetic; oral / gestural), the idea from
each converges at the same terminus and all else falls away&quot;
(OL 32-33).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Steve McCaffery's writing project has, from
the first, foregrounded the &quot;all else,&quot; what Georges
Bataille has defined as the &quot;excesses of energy&quot; inherent
in the economy of distribution and circulation (NI 201).  In literary
terms, &quot;excess&quot; is equivalent to the <I>paragram</I>,
which McCaffery defines, following Julia Kristeva and Leon S.
Roudiez, as a text whose &quot;organization of words (and their
denotations), grammar, and syntax is challenged by the infinite
possibilities provided by letters or phonemes combining to form
networks of signification not accessible through conventional
reading habits.&quot;  The paragram &quot;is that aspect of language
which <I>escapes</I> all discourse&quot; (NI 63-64).  An
analogy to the paragram or what he calls the &quot;cipheral text&quot;
(NI 19) would be the biotopological form known as the Klein worm--
&quot;a form which differs from conventional geometric forms in
its characteristic absence of both inner and outer surfaces....
Any part of the form can touch, contact, communicate with, flow
with any other part&quot; (NI 20).  The Klein worm provides the
model for a form &quot;without 'walls' with milieu and constellation
replacing syntax.  The letter-- in its major and minor registrations--not
the word forms the basic unit of organization&quot; (NI 21).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> If this defense of the paragrammatic, of
what McCaffery calls &quot;a first order experience of graphemes&quot;
(NI 19) is reminiscent of the manifestos of Concrete poetry prominent
in the fifties and sixties, the difference between a &quot;post-Concrete&quot;
poet like McCaffery and his mentors--the <I>Noigandres</I><I>
</I>group in Brazil, Ian Hamilton Finlay in England--is that McCaffery's
unit has always been the page rather than the individual concrete
poem, and, beyond the page, the book.   In a fanciful Cratylian
study, McCaffery (writing together with bpNichol) points out that
the word <I>book</I> is etymologically connected with the
name of the beech-tree (OE. <I>bok</I><I>, boce</I>,
ON. <I>bok</I>) as well as the Gothic <I>boka </I>(letter
of the alphabet), whose plural form <I>bokos</I> means
writing or document.  Book as beech-leaf (an organic object),
book as document: the double meaning, McCaffery and Nichol suggest,
denies the book the passive role we generally assign to it.  Similarly,
<I>page </I>comes from the Latin <I>pagina,</I>
whose stem <I>pag-</I>  is also that of <I>pangere</I>,
to fasten, fix in, fix together.  A page, the authors conclude,
is not just a blank sheet, waiting for &quot;meaningful&quot;
print to be affixed to it, but a kind of trellis, upon which words
and letters are fastened visually as well as semantically.  Thus
the &quot;book of the writer&quot; becomes the &quot;book of the
written&quot; (KNK 56).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> <I>Artist's Book</I> may not seem
like quite the right term for the resultant productions.  Illustrations,
for example the reproductions of old engravings underlying the
text in <I>In England Now that Spring</I> and the anatomical
drawings in <I>Panopticon</I>, are sparse, and the innovative
typography, used in the early works like <I>Ow's Waif</I>,
gives way, in the recent <I>Black Debt</I>, to a long,
continuous block of large type with justified left and right margins.
 Compared to, say, John Baldessari's or Martha Rosler's artists'
books, McCaffery's look amateurish and a shade drab.  One would
not expect to see them in art galleries or at &quot;book art&quot;
exhibitions.  But as Johanna Drucker has shown in her recent <I>The
Century of Artists' Books</I>, the only distinguishing feature
of &quot;artists' books,&quot; a genre that has come into its
own only in the twentieth century, is that &quot;they call attention
to the specific character of a book's identity while they embody
the expressive complexity of the book as a communicative form.&quot;
Drucker places McCaffery's work in the chapter &quot;Books as
Verbal Exploration,&quot; and more specifically under &quot;Typewriter
Works.&quot;  Her emphasis on the book <I>qua</I> book,
with its tension between the apparent conventionality of the codex
form and and the &quot;inexhaustible possibilities&quot; of its
composition, echoes an earlier discussion of artists' books by
Richard Kostelanetz.  &quot;[An] essential distinction,&quot;
he writes, &quot;separates imaginative books from conventional
books.  In the latter, syntactically familiar sentences are set
in rectangular blocks of uniform type (resembling soldiers in
a parade), and these are then &quot;designed&quot; into pages
that look like each other (and like pages we have previously seen).
 An imaginative book, by definition, attempts to realize something
else with syntax, with format, with pages, with covers, with size,
with shapes, with sequence, with structure, with binding--with
any or all of these elements.&quot;  In this sense, McCaffery's
are certainly exemplars of book art, pages functioning as &quot;trellises&quot;
upon which lettrist and verbal experiments are hung, the whole
giving a very different impression from the individual page on
the one hand and the conventional illustrated book on the other.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> McCaffery's first book experiment or, more
accurately page experiment was called <I>Carnival, the first
panel: 1967-70</I> and published by the Coach House Press
in Toronto in 1973.  The work was made by placing masks on each
of sixteen standard 81/2-by-11-inch pages, arranged in groups
of four to make a square (or, strictly speaking, rectangle) measuring
44 by 36 inches.  The sixteen pages were then perforated and arranged
in sequential book form, accompanied by the Instructions, &quot;In
order to destroy this book please tear each page carefully along
the perforation.  The panel is assembled by laying out pages in
a square of four.&quot;  The readerly dilemma thus created was
that in order to take in the whole panel, the book has to be destroyed.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> As for the mask technique itself, McCaffery
has explained his procedures as follows:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Carnival</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">was essentially a cartographic
project; a repudiation of linearity in writing and the search
for an alternative syntax in 'mapping'.... The panels grew directly
through the agency of the typewriter and through the agency of
marginal link-ups.... As a mask bled off a page I would devise
another shape that picked up the bleed of the text at the margin....
the mask came about as a way to create a painterly shape by censoring
the flow of typewritten line.  It was a method of arriving at
a collage effect without resort to the actual adhesion of different
fragments to a support surface.... It's important to remember
that the mask excludes and deletes much of the written text. 
What results are deliberately induced fragments, parts of inscription
whose terminations and commencements are not determined by a writing
subject or a logical intention but by a material, random intervention.
(OL 72-73).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Since the writing in this &quot;multi-panel
language environment&quot; was a &quot;spontaneous emission into
the space set up by the mask for writing,&quot; there are large
areas of &quot;non-semantic type, zones of repeated letters and
lettristic clusters that attempt a sort of abstract expressionism
through the typewriter&quot; (OL 72; see figure 12.1).  Such coherent
words and phrases as do appear in the panels were later repudiated
by McCaffery as &quot;incredible naive... I built the text around
certain biblical allusions.  Adam as the power of nomination;
Babel as the source of polyglossia and so on.  All of this I would
now scrap&quot; (OL 72).   </FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> <I>Carnival, the second panel: 1971-75</I></FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">
(published 1977) takes what McCaffery calls &quot;a structure
of strategic counter-communication&quot; even further.  Whereas
the first panel was entirely typewriter generated, the second
&quot;places the typed mode in agonistic relation with other forms
of scription: xerography, xerography within xerography ... electrostasis,
rubber-stamp, tissue texts, hand-lettering and stencil.&quot;
 The effect (figure 12.2) is a distancing of language so as to
foreground its &quot;neglected qualities of immanence and non-reference,&quot;
language as a &quot;seen thing,&quot; as McCaffery puts it in
the Introduction (C2).  But although the sixteen-panel overview,
as depicted here, allows for little comprehension of individual
words or phrases, the individual panel-pages make various &quot;reading
paths&quot; available.  Thus the spokes of the wheel on the tenth
page (figure 12.3) are rubber-stamped &quot;CHANGE OF ADDRESS&quot;
signs, underneath which, we find a complicated set of tissue texts
and xerographies, the fragmented words referring to a text by
Charpentier &quot;on how the gothic cathedral is built up palimpsestically,&quot;
 to &quot;geomantic syntax often depicted as snakes.&quot;  And
indeed those &quot;snakes&quot; do appear as part of the graphic
page design (see figure 2).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> <I>Carnival</I>  represents the first
stage of McCafferian language experimentation,  the stage when
the &quot;death of the referent&quot; as well as the fabled &quot;death
of the subject&quot; were taken to be <I>de rigueur</I>.
 As the poet's book art evolved, the drive toward non-referentiality
began to give way to the recognition that the referent never wholly
&quot;dies,&quot; even if the &quot;trace structure&quot; and
&quot;scriptive play&quot; (Derrida's terms) of poetic language
complicate its determination (NI 148-49).  The same holds true
for the speaking subject.  &quot;The most enduring accusation
against early Concrete [poetry],&quot;  McCaffery was to note
in the Yale symposium, was &quot;its failure to engage the social
base of language as an interactive heteroglossia,&quot; the &quot;divorce
from social utterance which instantly de-politicizes the work&quot;
(EVC 373).  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> A first step toward this re-engagement with
social utterance is found in the book works of the mid-seventies,
<I>Dr. Sadhu's Muffins</I> and <I>'Ow's Waif</I>,
where the writing is based entirely on &quot;supply texts chosen
at random from whatever happened to be on or near my desk when
I was working&quot; (DSM).  These &quot;supply texts&quot;--the
Concise Oxford Dictionary, the works of Shakespeare, the <I>I
Ching</I>, various newspapers, magazines and abandoned drafts
of earlier poems--were subjected to &quot;numerous chance and
random techniques to assist me in word selection and partial syntactic
structuring to a degree such as would keep me excluded from the
content part of the compositions.&quot;   The reader will recognize
this as a technique similar to Jackson Mac Low's chance-generated
poems and especially to John Cage's &quot;writings through&quot;
texts from the Bible to <I>Finnegans Wake</I>.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> How does this &quot;writing through&quot;
work in <I>Dr. Sadhu's Muffins</I>?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">In the &quot;Note on the Method of Composition,&quot;
from which I have been quoting, McCaffery explains:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">as a poet
i took responsibility for the page but not necessarily for everything
that found  its way onto the page.  what i did was set up the

its own way settling in its own syntactic space. . . .</FONT>

closed fields of independent energy and image. . . .</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">But if <I>Carnival</I> subordinated
the semantic to visual effects, <I>Dr. Sadhu's Muffins</I>
works the other way around.  It looks, to begin with like a perfectly
normal book of poems.  True, the endpapers feature witty collage-drawings
with letters from &quot;Steve&quot; to &quot;Tim&quot; about matters
of production concerning the very book we're reading (see figure
12.4), and each poetic sequence has a separate title page, facing
a page of abstract black and white graphics.  But the texts themselves
are printed conventionally enough.  Take the section called &quot;Anamorphoses,&quot;
which the note describes as &quot;attempts to 'describe out of
definition,' to transform a comprehension into a perception, the
known thing into the thing seen, by having a text generate itself
out of the dictionary definition of its title.&quot;  The eighteenth
anamorphosis is called &quot;button,&quot; immediately recalling
Gertrude Stein's <I>Tender Buttons</I>, which provides
McCaffery with the epigraph to the sequence, &quot;Act so that
there is no use in a centre.&quot;  But &quot;button&quot; is
centered on its numbered page like any little Imagist lyric:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">                         (figure 12.5)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Here the nonparallel columns --&quot;disk&quot;
is matched to &quot;(sewn)&quot;, &quot;sewn&quot; to &quot;(biscuit)&quot;
and so on-- recall Dada rather than Imagist lyrics, but the poem,
however dependent it may be on its &quot;supply texts,&quot; is
fairly straightforward, referring as it does to a &quot;required&quot;
&quot;hole,&quot; to &quot;some small pressing,&quot; to a movement
that goes &quot;up  in  /  in  to,&quot; and then to &quot;sewn&quot;
and &quot;took apart,&quot; counterposed to the &quot;disk&quot;/
&quot;biscuit&quot; rhyme.  Stein's own <I>Tender Buttons</I>
is, to use McCaffery's own vocabulary, more radically paragrammatic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Much more effective is the title prose poem,
which uses a &quot;core structure of 13 phrases selected at random
from the <I>Toronto Globe &amp; Mail</I><I> </I>and repeated
and permuted according to a predetermined chance programme.&quot;
 Among these phrases, most of them marvelously vapid, are, &quot;the
virtues of middle age were the ones that marked the Fifties,&quot;
&quot;That was a terrible day   I could eat nothing.    I felt
faint,&quot;  and &quot;the foundations for the new world are
being laid right now.&quot;  Dr. Sadhu makes his appearance in
the sentence, &quot;Let me put the matter allegorically, friends
of Dr. Sadhu Singh Dhami are invited to attend a lecture entitled
  'Between Two Worlds'&quot; (DSM 12).  As for the muffins, these
have nothing to do with Dr. Sadhu, except in McCaffery's scheme
of things; their actual entrance cue comes on the opening page
in the phrase, &quot;dropping him a scented note or a flower or
a bran muffin baked with her own little hands.&quot;  Dr. Sadhu
makes only three appearances in the poem that bears his name,
but the &quot;dropping....muffin&quot; phrase appears six times,
always in different contexts, and then begins to permutate,  &quot;dropping
him a scented note&quot; splitting off from the rest of the phrase
and undergoing reshuffling, so that we read: </FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">where the syntactic displacement of &quot;own

unnamed she is now baking in the oven along with the bran muffin.
 And if that can happen, why not attribute muffins to the evening's
lecturer on the topic &quot;Between Two Worlds,&quot; the eminent
Dr. Sadhu Singh Dhami?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> The parodic word play of these found texts
looks ahead to the profoundly satiric <I>Black Debt</I>
of 1989.  As book art, however, <I>Dr. Sadhu's Muffins</I>
is less interesting than another book of this period, <I>Ow's
Waif</I>, which is a comically abbreviated version of Longfellow's<I>
</I>[as in Henry Wadsworth] <I>The Waif</I>. Again, the
poet's stated aim is to create &quot;a near to total. separation
of form from content, the entire 'borrowing' of content as a prepared
word-supply (a 'supply-text') and a creative concentration on
the invention of the poems' forms as verbal fields free of presupposed
or prerequisite rule structures of grammar and syntax.&quot; 
The supply-text functions &quot;as the total available language
system for the poem&quot;; this time these texts include Newton's
<I>Optics </I>1705 ed., an Evelyn Waugh biography of Edmund
Campion, Susanna Moodie's <I>Roughing it in the Bush</I>,
a trigonometry textbook, Jacques Maritain's <I>Creative Intuition
in Art and Poetry</I>, Edgar Allen Poe's <I>The Poetic
Principle</I> and John Cage's <I>A Year from Monday</I>.
 There is also a set of poems called &quot;Ten Portraits,&quot;
whose supply-text is a transcribed interview with some N.Y. prostitutes.
 As in <I>Dr. Sadhu's Muffins</I>, word choice, frequency,
recurrence, etc. are produced by systematic chance operations,
although there are instances of &quot;careful conscious choice.&quot;
 The &quot;operating analogy,&quot; in any case, is &quot;cubism:
the process of fragmentation and reconstitution of a known thing
in a fresh form.&quot;  Or, we might say, using McCaffery's own
designation, anamorphosis.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Unlike <I>Carnival </I>and <I>Dr.
Sadhu's Muffins</I>, <I>Ow's Waif</I> is something
of a collaboration: the design and instant lettering collages
were made for the Coach House Press by Robert MacDonald.  The
miniature (6&quot; x 4&quot;) book is beautifully produced and
all of a piece, typographical design in primary colors being integrated
with the printed texts.  The title page foregrounds red letters
and numbers, some in bold type, some transparent, against a &quot;busy&quot;
yellow background: the title itself is rendered in black or outlined
letters, the first and second <B>W</B>'s having opposite designs
(figure 12.6).  The <B>O</B> is rendered as a black circular disk,
a black sun or an apple with a stem-like shape (the dot of an
<B>i</B>?  an apostrophe?), even as the first <B>W</B> is transparent
and the <B>A</B> of &quot;Waif&quot; is an &quot;empty&quot; letter
silhouetted against a black triangle.  The black / white, full
/ empty contrast is then reversed in the book's centerfold (figure
12.7): now it is the <B>O</B> that is merely outlined (and almost
invisible) and the two giant-size bold<B>  W</B>'s, letters that
here dwarf everything else, are identical.  The typefaces of &quot;Waif,&quot;
furthermore, produce paragrams in the form of &quot;a&quot; and
&quot;if.&quot;  &quot;What if?&quot;, the second page seems to
ask?  And the long dash, followed by what looks like a colon,
leaves the question open.  What if what?  Given the background
pictographs--letters, numbers, houses, dollar signs, telephone
shapes--the possibilities for narrative are intriguingly open.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">   The visual representation of the words,
in any case, reenforces the paragrammatic play of the title: &quot;Ow's&quot;
seems to be Cockney dialect for &quot;How's,&quot; in which case
the phrase, spoken aloud, sounds like &quot;How's the wife?&quot;
 &quot;Ow's&quot; also suggests &quot;Owl's,&quot; and since owls
are solitary nocturnal creatures the sense of &quot;waif-hood&quot;
is made more prominent.  And when we turn to the individual &quot;poems,&quot;
we note that the layout of the titles (taken from the supply texts)
is often striking, calling attention to its own meanings which
are often intensified by, or in competition with, the individual
texts.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Take the double page spread for &quot;E.A.
Poe  The Poetic Principle&quot; (figure 12.8).  Here <B>POE</B>
anticipates the first two syllables of <B>POETIC, </B>but, at
the same time, the title can be read as <B>Ea</B>'s  <B>THE POE
PRINCIPLE</B>, even as <B>THE POET</B>, printed in lighter dotted
letters, is subordinated.  And this is of course what Poe's famous
essay does: it applies the &quot;Poe Principle&quot; to all &quot;Poetry&quot;
and equates the two:</FONT>

with, if not his own personality, at least his own signature.
 One of McCaffery's recurrent themes, for instance, is the human
inability to draw proper conclusions, to make correct syllogisms
and analogies.  So the &quot;writing through&quot; the elementary
trigonometry book produces passages like the following:</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Geneva"> <I>Dr. Sadhu's Muffins</I> and <I>Ow's
Waif</I> represent the &quot;writing through&quot; or &quot;supply
text&quot; stage of McCaffery's book art, but, by the later seventies,
 the poet was moving on to other experiments.  <I>Knowledge
Never Knew</I> (figure 12.9), published in 1983 although composed
some years earlier, turns to a different language game: the recharging
of a time-honored genre, the aphorism, coupled with a rethinking
of Pound's famous definition of the epic as a &quot;poem including
history.&quot;  In <I>Open Letter,</I> McCaffery recalls
the genesis of the book: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"> <I>Knowledge Never Knew</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">
 </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">was written as a reaction to
those awful collections of aphorisms such as Chazal's <I>Sens
Plastique</I> (great title / terrible book) and Dahlberg's
<I>Reasons of the Heart</I> (terrible title / terrible
book). . . . The aphorism is a defiant and extremely presumptious
form.  It's intellectually cheeky.  Its force derives not just
from the classical brevity of its appearance (that would link
it to the epigram) but also from the successful excision of the
discursive elements that make it possible.  It is thus an ideal
model of parricide.  (OL 76)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Whereas the &quot;language of the critical
essay is normally contextual and integrative, and of a cumulative,
linked,  propositional nature,&quot; the aphorism, inherently
&quot;brief&quot; and &quot;non-integrative,&quot; &quot;calls
attention to its own scenic disposition&quot; (OL 77).  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> The aphorisms are placed at the bottom of
each page; at the top (with a large expanse of white space in
between), McCaffery has placed a series of dates, times of day,
and pointless historical facts ostensibly relating to those dates,
thus playing the &quot;audacity&quot; of the aphorism against
the &quot;banality&quot; of historical &quot;fact.&quot;  The
dialogic format of double bands is designed to make the reader
ponder the very nature of facticity, both upper and lower bands
providing what at first looks like &quot;information.&quot;  To
put it another way: when &quot;knowledge&quot; is tested by placing
it in the unexpected context of the aphorism, it moves from &quot;knew&quot;
to &quot;new.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> The calendar (upper band) runs from 1 January
1 to 19 April, but the year designated shifts randomly from century
to century and the historical tag often doesn't go with the time
frame.  On page 12, for example, we read:</FONT>
<P>

<FONT FACE="Geneva">Here the &quot;encounters with history&quot;
are themselves absurd.  But further, these &quot;facts&quot; are
&quot;penetrated&quot; (McCaffery's own word) by the aphorisms
in the bottom band.  Here are the full pages 12 and 13:</FONT>

denied the priest.  And on the &quot;january 8 1943&quot; page,
the declaration that knowledge is a venal sin can be understood,
via the aphorism, as &quot;a motion&quot; that deals with &quot;e

<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">the irony here being that to write about &quot;somewhere

necessarily put the writing somewhere else at all.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Geneva"> A similar sleight of hand occurs on the &quot;january

<FONT FACE="Geneva">The medieval tale not inappropriately designated
by &quot;once upon a time,&quot; actually recounts what is &quot;twice

and the second the time when the Hippocentaur was found.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> To avoid predictability, the steady recurrence
of the A + B pattern, McCaffery introduces pages that have no
upper &quot;history&quot; band at all.  Page 31, for example,
provides only the date, &quot;january 31&quot; (with no year),
the aphorism reading:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  grammar is skeletal</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Geneva">  </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">the essence
of the sign is to be a margin emerging</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Here the pages enact what the words say: the
&quot;glandular&quot; words are given full force by subordinating
the &quot;skeletal&quot; grammar and placing a line of type at
the bottom of a nearly blank page so that the &quot;sign&quot;
can indeed &quot;be a margin emerging.&quot;   The final entry
in the book is for &quot;5.42 A.M.,&quot; no date or fact being
given.  What does the dawn hour signify?  The aphorism reads:
</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  never read</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  never write</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  always continue to learn</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">The pun on &quot;never wrong, never right&quot;
and the emphasis in the third line on continuity, on the projection
forward in the direction of the empty page beyond, provides a
nice form of anti-closure.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> <I>Knowledge Never Knew</I> thus constitutes
an important statement of aesthetic, an artist's commonplace book
where the briefest aphorisms force us to think through the question
of how writing works.  When, for example, the entry &quot;March
18 1923 / <I>Frank Sinatra baptized</I>&quot;  is &quot;penetrated&quot;
by the lines:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  to be rooted in anything</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  one must be rotated in something</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">the reader has an image of the infant Sinatra
&quot;rotated&quot; in the baptismal font, the relation of &quot;rootedness&quot;
to rotation thus making perfect sense.  Nothing, the poet seems
to be saying, is as irrelevant as you think it is.  Watch those
words you merely &quot;read&quot;!  Or, as the &quot;march 20&quot;
entry would have it,</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"> to ground yourself in words always
lean against your reading</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"> and balance on the weight of what

<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Such &quot;balancing&quot; acts have characterized
McCaffery's more recent books, <I>Evoba</I>, <I>Panopticon</I>,
and <I>The Black Debt</I><I>.</I> Since I have written
of the latter two elsewhere, I want to conclude here with a discussion
of <I>Evoba: The Investigation Meditations 1976-78</I>,
published in 1987.  <I>Evoba</I> is &quot;above&quot; spelled
backwards and the book's &quot;Meditations&quot; are on Wittgenstein's
<I>Philosophical Investigations</I>, which are quoted extensively.
 <I>Evoba</I> thus follows up the implications of <I>Knowledge
Never Knew</I>, which is written under the sign of the <I>Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus</I>.  Whereas <I>Knowledge</I>
plays on the individual Wittgenstein proposition, <I>Evoba
</I>takes up the more expansive language games of the <I>Investigations</I>.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Let us begin with the source of the title
<I>Evoba</I>, Wittgenstein's proposition 160:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"> Suppose that a man who is under the
influence of a certain drug is presented with a  series of characters
(which need not belong to any existing alphabet).  He utters words
 corresponding to the number of characters, as if they were letters,
and does so with all  the outward signs, and with the sensations,
of reading.... In such a case some people would  be inclined to
say the man was <I>reading</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">those marks.  Others, that he
was not.-- Suppose  he has in this way read (or interpreted) a
set of five marks as <I>A B O V</I><I> E</I>-- and
now we  show him the same marks in the reverse order and he reads
<I>E V O B A</I><I> </I>; and in further  texts he always
retains the same interpretation of the marks: here we should certainly
 be inclined to say he was making up an alphabet for himself <I>ad
hoc</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">and
then reading  accordingly.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">In opting for the &quot;reverse order,&quot;
McCaffery announces his aim to call our normal language habits
into question, to produce an oppositional text.  The frontispiece
plays on Wittgenstein's proposition #309 (&quot;What is your aim
in philosophy?-- To show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle,&quot;
PI 103e), declaring:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  If the aim of philosophy is, as</FONT>

the aim of</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">            poetry is to convince the
bottle that</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">        there is no fly.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Poetry, in McCaffery's witty spin on Wittgenstein's
theorem,  has no inside or outside, no &quot;fly&quot; that can
be removed from the bottle.  There is only the bottle itself,
the material object to be reconstructed textually.  &quot;The
limits of my language,&quot; as Wittgenstein put it,  are the
limits of my world.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> The first step is to get rid of the Augustinian
notion, called into question on the opening page of the <I>Philosophical
Investigations</I>, that <I>verba rerum nomina sunt</I><I>,</I>
 that &quot;the individual words in language name objects&quot;
(PI 2e).  The passage from Augustine's <I>Confessions</I>
(I.8) cited by Wittgenstein is rendered by McCaffery as a page
from a comic book (figure 12.12).  The first band, for example,
plays on the caption <I>&quot;Cum ipsi (majories homines apellabant
secundum each vocem corpus ad aliquid movebant, videbam</I><I>&quot;</I>
(&quot;When they [my elders] named some object, and accordingly
moved toward something, I saw this&quot;) by taking the &quot;mov[ing]
toward something&quot; quite literally as the clich&eacute; image
of a passionate lovers' kiss.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> The opening comic strip is further juxtaposed
to the photograph, which appears on the cover as well as on the
recto and verso of front and back endpapers (see figure 12.13)
of two men in hats, looking at books evidently taken from a floor-to-ceiling
bookcase which is surrounded by rubble--a library, as it were,
in the process of demolition or at the very least, transit.  Here,
McCaffery seems to be saying, is what philosophical meditations
look like.  And throughout the text there are cartoon-drawings,
rebuses, witty diagrams like the &quot;line&quot; / &quot;nile&quot;
crossing on p. 23 (figure 12.14) that are an integral part of
the poetic composition.  Indeed, layout is everywhere a part of
the meaning.  On facing pages (pp. 24-25), for example, we have
the opening sentence of #162 (PI 65e):</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  You are reading when you <I>derive</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">  the reproduction from the original</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Wittgenstein now goes on to demonstrate that
this definition could apply to someone who has been taught the
Cyrillic alphabet and, not knowing what words are being spelled
out, tries to pronounce every letter, one by one.  Strictly speaking,
such a person is <I>reading.</I>  But McCaffery's poetic
version (the fly-bottle without the fly) carries the proposition
much further:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">&quot;Red is by definition a &quot;colour,&quot;
but what do we know about it when we have so designated it?  Can
a &quot;judgement&quot; be &quot;red&quot;?  Yes, in the sense
that it is &quot;read.&quot;  Poetry draws on a &quot;common language&quot;
but it is inevitably a &quot;private syntax,&quot; McCaffery's
own poem juxtaposing verbs without subjects, pronouns without
antecedents, and the image of &quot;her lips&quot; and &quot;her
eyes,&quot; juxtaposed to &quot;the pain of a wheel,&quot; that
can refer to any number of narratives, especially when that pain
is juxtaposed to &quot;or what each thing would like to say,&quot;
where the &quot;or&quot; follows no &quot;either.&quot;   Indeed,
McCaffery's meditation on memory and time, a dictionary and a
table, lips and eyes, red and blue, once and then, private syntax
and common language, never makes clear what it is that &quot;each
thing would like to say.&quot;  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> <I>Evoba</I> culminates in a series
of pages that bring McCaffery's intense scrutiny of language to
a remarkable verbal / visual resolution.  On page 98, a child's
drawing of a cloud is suspended in space over a diagonal block
<B>E</B>, that looks rather like a doormat or grate.  On the facing
page (99), McCaffery reproduces the conclusion of Wittgenstein's
proposition 426: &quot;In the actual use of expressions we make
detours, we go by sideroads.  We see the straight highway before
us, but of course we cannot use it, because it is permanently
closed&quot; (PI 127e).   The book we have been reading has, in
fact, enacted this very insight and so, we read at bottom right,
&quot;The book exploded in his hand.  Slowly, at first.&quot;
 As the book gets ready to disappear, the poet turns his attention
to Wittgenstein's meditation on the meaning of &quot;pain&quot;
and &quot;feeling,&quot; especially Wittgenstein's proposition
284: &quot;And so, too, a corpse seems to us quite inacessible
to pain.&quot;  What, then, is it to be alive?  The last page
of the book looks like this (figure 12.16):</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva"> Take the <B>I</B> (the individual self) out
of <B>ALIVE</B> and what do you have?  <B>AL  VE</B>, perhaps
the truncated <B>SALVE </B>of <B>SALVE REGINA</B>, with its reminder
of the Mass.  Or perhaps an anagram on <B>VALE</B> (<B>AVE ATQUE
VALE</B>--&quot;Hail and Farewell&quot;). Then again, the <B>I</B>
is only a lower-case <B>i</B>, so maybe its removal, along with
those little rain-drop circles falling from the <B>AL  VE</B>
cloud, doesn't damage <B>ALIVE</B> all that much.  It would be
pretty to think so except that near the bottom of the page on
the right, we have the single word <I><B>dead</B></I>.
 Language, as Wittgenstein argues and as McCaffery knows full
well, has its own power.  Take the <B>i</B> out of <B>ALIVE</B>,
and you have <I><B>dead</B>.</I>  Read sequentially, this
is what the page &quot;says.&quot;  But read spatially--and in
McCaffery's books we must always read spatially--what dominates
is the oval containing <B>AL  VE</B>, dropping its <B>i's</B>.
 Poetry, the text tells us, needn't focus on individual sensibility.
 When the &quot;i&quot; drops out, emphasis shifts from the author
to the reader.  As the first page of <I><B>Evoba</B> </I>would
have it: </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">The

<P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Thus it is that <I>Evoba </I>challenges
the notion of the book as &quot;machine,&quot; designed &quot;to
accommodate printed linguistic information in a linear form&quot;
(RG 60).  &quot;The emphasis on the visual element in writing,&quot;
as McCaffery and Nichol put it, &quot;[has] a <I>poetic</I>
emergence&quot; The page, in this scheme of things,  is no longer
&quot;an obstacle to be overcome&quot; but &quot;a profoundly
active space&quot; (RG 65).  And so &quot;a reader enters.&quot;

phallus, is to be understood less as a physical organ than an
ideologically saturated signified fundamentally complicit with
the logocentric tradition.  A further dimension is the abrogation
of linearity.  The latter we have come to understand not merely
as a spatial arrangement but as a way of thinking&quot; (p. 372).
