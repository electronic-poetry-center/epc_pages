<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#062FDC" SIZE=+2>It</FONT> is now twenty years ago that
  a SUNY-Binghamton professor named William Spanos, a Heideggerian student
  of poetics, who was bent on opposing everything the New Criticism, in which
  he had been trained, stood for, founded a journal called <I>boundary 2</I>,
  subtitled <I>An International Journal of Postmodern Literature</I>. The
  title is emblematic of the period: the lower-case <I>boundary 2</I> points
  to the desire and need for new parameters, new margins-- a &quot;second&quot;
  way to define literature. &quot;International&quot; means, in sixties or
  seventies-speak, European as well as American; the first issue of <I>boundary
  2</I> features an essay on Foucault by Edward Said and another on the <I>Nouveau
  Roman</I> by Bruce Morrisette, side by side with Warren Tallman's piece
  on William Carlos Williams's short stories, Joseph Riddel's deconstructionist
  essay on Wallace Stevens, and James Curtis's essay on Marshall McLuhan
  and French structuralism. The poetry published in the issue may also be
  considered &quot;international&quot; since there is a 35-page portfolio
  of work by the Greek poet Yannis Ritsos. </P>
  <P>But it is the word <I>literature</I> in the title that I find especially
  interesting. For, although post-structuralist theory is already much in
  evidence (witness Edward Said on Foucault, Riddel on Stevens via Paul de
  Man, and Spanos himself on the postmodern imagination via Heidegger), the
  journal's focus is very much on literature, it still being a given, in
  1972, that &quot;literary&quot; journals, published as they were by English
  or Comparative Literature departments, would concentrate, from however
  radical a point of view, on literary texts. Consider, for example, David
  Antin's seminal essay &quot;Modernism and Postmodernism: Approaching the
  Present in American Poetry,&quot; published in the first issue. </P>
  <P>Antin writes from the perspective of the practicing poet, who was also
  beginning to make a name for himself as a performance artist and art critic,
  having recently been appointed chair of the newly formed Visual Arts department
  of the University of California-San Diego. His <I>boundary 2 </I>essay
  brilliantly dismantles what he calls the &quot;closed verse tradition&quot;
  of late mdernist poetry from Delmore Schwartz to W. D. Snodgrass. &quot;What
  we have called the 'modern' for so long,&quot; Antin declares, is thoroughly
  over&quot;; accordingly, the recycling of the symbolist lyric (Antin dismisses
  W. D. Snodgrass's <I>After Experience</I> as &quot;an updated version of
  <I>A Shropshire Lad</I>&quot;), as well as the recycling of collage (e.g.,
  Robert Lowell's &quot;attenuated history collage&quot; in &quot;Concord&quot;
  or &quot;For the Union Dead&quot;), can only be retrograde 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#1" TARGET="resource window">1</A>)</font>.
  Over against Snodgrass and Lowell, Antin sets Charles Olson, the then hero
  of the poetic counterculture; Olson's &quot;disregard for metrical organization
  and for a poetical frame that wraps things up&quot; (DA 117) is considered
  exemplary. Indeed, following the scenario first made prominent by Donald
  Allen in <I>The New American Poetry</I> (1960), Antin describes the &quot;great
  explosion of American poetry&quot; in the sixties as the final rejection
  of the &quot;closed-verse&quot; tradition of neo-modernist, late New Critical
  poetry, in favor of a more direct and spontaneous poetry based on natural
  utterance, on the breath. The &quot;opening of the field&quot; by the Black
  Mountain and Beat poets, by the New York school and the San Francisco Renaissance,
  so the argument goes, was animated by &quot;the underlying conviction that
  poetry was made by a man [<I>sic</I> ] on his feet talking&quot; (DA 131).
  As such, the poetic text was to be understood less as an object than as
  a &quot;score&quot; or &quot;notation&quot; to be actualized in performance,
  the implication of such &quot;scoring&quot; being that &quot;phenomenological
  reality is 'discovered' and 'constructed' by poets&quot; (DA 132-33). And
  further: postmodernist poetics meant the turn from Pound and Eliot to the
  neglected work of Gertrude Stein and John Cage, the poetry of Dada and
  Surrealism, and &quot;the poetry of nonliterate and partially literate
  cultures&quot; (133) : in the case of the latter, Antin is of course thinking
  of the ethnopoetics movement spearheaded by his friend and fellow-poet
  Jerome Rothenberg. Indeed, one of the early issues (Spring 1975) of <I>boundary
  2</I> was a special issue on &quot;The Oral Impulse in Contemporary American
  Poetry,&quot; featuring the work of Rothenberg and again Antin.</P>
  <P>To reread Antin's 1972 essay in 1992 is to become aware of how much
  our assumptions about postmodernism have changed. The essay's frame of
  reference is, to begin with, resolutely <I>literary</I>, the issue being
  who has inherited and who should inherit the poetic mantle of the great
  modernists: such neo-modernists as Robert Lowell, who carry on, in attenuated
  form, the symbolist collage tradition of <I>The Waste Land</I> and the
  <I>Cantos</I>, or such &quot;phenomenological&quot; poets as Olson and
  Creeley? Closed verse versus open form, the metrical line versus the &quot;breath,&quot;
  poetry as product versus poetry as process, symbolism versus immanence
  (as Charles Altieri put it in another important essay published in <I>boundary
  </I>2 in 1973) <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#2" TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</font>, and so on. But although the poem as
  autonomous artifact is rejected, Poetry itself remains an autonomous realm,
  contaminated neither by culture nor by theory nor by any of the discourses
  that surround it. It is also the case that just about all of Antin's poets,
  whether Good Guys or Bad Guys are white men. Indeed, the &quot;field&quot;
  which is supposedly &quot;opening&quot; is, at the practical level, the
  setting of a polite athletic contest (hockey? soccer?), where the Harvard
  team captained by Robert Lowell plays the Harvard team captained by Charles
  Olson. To put it another way: Antin, who is obviously a member of the Olson
  team, is theorizing his own practice, telling us what kind of poetry he
  wants to produce (the utterance of &quot;a man on his feet talking&quot;)
  and why.</P>
  <P>But there is another assumption Antin makes (as does Altieri in &quot;From
  Symbolism to Immanence,&quot; and the book that revised this essay, <I>Enlarging
  the Temple, </I>as does James E. B. Breslin's <I>From Modern to </I>Contemporary,
  even though Breslin is careful not to use the P word, and as does my own
  <I>Poetics of Indeterminacy</I>), namely the assumption that <B>poetry
  matters </B><FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#3" TARGET="resource window">3</A>)</font>. Poetic discourse, in early formulations
  of postmodernism, is not just a site to be contested and intersected by
  other discourses; for-- and this is the corollary assumption--there is
  such a thing as <B>poetic value. </B>Not only is Olson &quot;better&quot;
  than a member of the other team like Snodgrass; Ginsberg is judged to be
  better than Ferlinghetti, Denise Levertov (one of the few women poets regularly
  cited in the 70s) is better than May Swenson, Frank O'Hara better than
  Ted Berrigan. </P>
  <P>These twin assumptions--the value of poetry and the ability to discriminate
  specific poetic value-- are just as central to discussions of the other
  arts. In 1972 art with a capital A still mattered and it mattered that
  Jasper Johns was &quot;better&quot; than a second-generation abstract expressionist
  like Norman Bluhm. Merce Cunningham was judged to be more &quot;interesting&quot;
  than Murray Feldman. And so on. Indeed, theorizing postmodernism, during
  the first decades of its usage, was animated by the belief--and here <I>boundary
  2</I><B> </B>was quite typical-- that postmodernism represents everything
  that is radical, innovative, forward-looking--<I>beyond</I> , if not contra,
  mere modernism, and is thus distinguished from the mass of writing or painting
  or architecture, which, far from challenging modernism, merely carries
  on its traditions.</P>
  <P>It is interesting to reread Ihab Hassan in this regard. Hassan's first
  book, after all, was called <I>The Literature of Silence</I> (1967), and
  made the case for a &quot;new literature&quot; written in the wake of Dachau
  and Hiroshima, a literature whose &quot;total rejection of Western history
  and civilization&quot; leads either to the apocalyptic violence and obscenity
  of a Henry Miller or a Norman Mailer or the silence, randomness, and indeterminacy
  of Samuel Beckett or John Cage. By 1971, Hassan referred to this &quot;change
  in Modernism&quot; as Postmodernism and drew up the first of his famous
  lists or tables, a table made up of binary oppositions <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#4" TARGET="resource window">4</A>)</font>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR>
  <BR>
  </P>
  <P>Hassan's frame of reference is, on the face of it, much broader than
  Antin's: he draws upon fiction as well as poetry, on philosophy, the visual
  arts, and certain well known critical texts like Lionel Trilling's <I>Beyond
  Culture</I>. Urbanism, for example, is exemplified by Baudelaire, Proust,
  Rilke, Eliot, and Dos Passos; Technologism, by Cubism, Futurism, and Dada,
  with a reference to Wylie Sypher's <I>Literature and Technology</I>, and
  the entry on Modernist Antinomianism alludes to Nathan A. Scott's <I>The
  Broken Center</I>. The Postmodern column is similarly eclectic, trans-urbanism
  (the Global Village) being represented by Buckminster Fuller, Marshall
  McLuhan, science fiction, and so on. </P>
  <P>But like Antin, and like almost everyone who wrote on the subject in
  the seventies, postmodernism was where it was happening, where the excitement
  was. Not because the individual writers of modernism (Pound, Eliot, Rilke,
  Mann) were not perhaps greater than those of postmodernism, but because
  PoMo was presented as being <B>open, anti-elitist, anti-</B>authoritarian,
  participatory, anarchic, playful, improvisational, <B>rebellious, discontinuous--</B>and
  even, in Hassan's words, <B>ecologically </B>active, otherwise known as
  <B>Green</B>. To write from a postmodernist perspective, in these years,
  thus involved a romantic faith in the open-endedness of literary and artistic
  discourse, in the ability of these discourses to transform themselves,
  to go beyond existing models and improve on them. As such, this Utopian
  phase of postmodernism was very much an inside view, a witnessing on the
  part of the poets themselves (and Hassan used all manner of typographical
  devices and fragmentary forms so as to ally himself with the poets) that
  there was still a cutting edge.</P>
  <P>Within a decade, a curious reversal had set in. By 1978, Hassan, always
  something of a barometer, published an essay called &quot;Culture, Indeterminacy,
  and Value,&quot; that contained more references to Foucault and de Man
  than to McLuhan or Cage or Burroughs. The essay is written under the sign
  of Nietzsche and makes much of the &quot;disappearance&quot; of man as
  a &quot;concrete figuration of history&quot; (IHPT 52-53). And the 1982
  &quot;Towards a Concept of Postmodernism&quot; begins with a catalogue
  of names that &quot;may serve to adumbrate postmodernism, a catalogue that
  opens with the following names: Jacques Derrida, Jean-Francois Lyotard,
  Michel Foucault, Hayden White, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, R. D. Laing,
  Norman O. Brown, Herbert Marcuse, Jean Baudrillard, Jurgen Habermas, Thomas
  Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend, Roland Barthes, Julia Kristeva, Wolfgang Iser, the
  Yale critics.&quot; The list then turns to dancers, composers, artists,
  architects, and &quot;various authors&quot; from Beckett and Borges to
  John Ashbery and Robert Wilson (IHPT 85). But theory , specifically French
  theory, is clearly at the center of the enterprise. The open form or process
  model celebrated by David Antin now gives way to the &quot;semantic instability&quot;
  of Derrida, and since the construction of the text as trace structure,
  as a tissue of differences, can be applied to writings of any period, the
  examples begin to come from established writers, primarily of the nineteenth
  century--Rousseau and Shelley, Marx and Mallarm&eacute;, Nerval and Nietzsche.
  Not reading the New, but re-reading the familiar in the light of the New
  Theory-- this becomes the order of the day.</P>
  <P>The widespread acceptance of Jean-Francois Lyotard's paradigm of <I>la
  condition postmoderne</I> (1979, English translation 1984) marks this shift
  from what we might call David Antin's pragmatics of postmodernism (the
  inside view of the practicing poet) to the broader cultural definition
  of the term as it used today. When Lyotard defines the <I>postmodern</I>
  as &quot;incredulity toward metanarratives,&quot; when he describes the
  &quot;two major versions of such narratives of legitimation,&quot; as that
  of the liberation of humanity (justice) and the speculative unity of all
  knowledge (truth), the term <I>modernism </I>points, not as in Antin or
  Hassan's case, to the particular literary and art movements of the early
  twentieth century, but to the larger <I>modernity</I> of Enlightenment
  discourse, specifically to the various progress models of the nineteenth
  century, which are central to Lyotard's discussion 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#5" TARGET="resource window">5</A>)</font>.
  But when Lyotard declares that in postindustrial society the &quot;grand
  narrative has lost its credibility&quot; (PC 37), that &quot;Modernist&quot;
  statements of legitimation , whether regarding truth (e.g., &quot;The earth
  revolves around the sun&quot;) or regarding justice (e.g., &quot;The minimum
  wage must be set at x dollars') no longer hold, one wonders if Lyotard's
  own metanarrative of delegitimation can really account for the specific
  changes that have occurred in Western societies over the last few decades.
  </P>
  <P>Why, to begin with <I>the</I> not <I>a</I> &quot;postmodern condition&quot;
  and why the singular form of the noun? Perhaps because <I>The Postmodern
  Condition </I>is itself a metanarrative, the story of how, in the face
  of post-World War II scientific knowledge, technology, and information
  theory, the delegitimation of the &quot;grand&quot; metanarratives has
  set in. Interestingly, the Lyotard paradigm continues to make the case
  for <I>difference</I>, for openness (the &quot;essay,&quot; he says, is
  postmodern; the fragment, stll modern), and, in a famous formulation, for
  the <I>unpresentable</I>, perceptible in &quot;presentation itself; that
  which denies itself the solace of good forms&quot; (PC 81). But in practice,
  respect for <I>difference</I> has now hardened into a set of norms and
  prescriptions that leave very little room for the free play, the anarchy,
  the indeterminacy, and disjunctive form that used to be considered characteristic
  of postmodernism.</P>
  <P>Consider the position of Fredric Jameson, whose <I>Postmodernism or,
  The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</I> is surely the best-known and
  most widely respected discussion of the subject. It is worth remembering
  that Jameson wrote the Foreword to the English translation of Lyotard's
  <I>La Condition</I> postmoderne and that, although he subjects Lyotard's
  argument to a more orthodox Marxist spin, he too believes that we have
  come to an end of the &quot;great master narratives.&quot; The title chapter
  of <I>The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</I>, first published in 1984
  in the <I>New Left Review</I>, designates &quot;one fundamental feature
  of all the postmodernisms,&quot; &quot;the effacement in them of the older
  (essentially high-modernist) frontier between high culture and so-called
  mass or commercial culture.... The postmodernisms have, in fact, been fascinated
  precisely by this whole &quot;degraded&quot; landscape of schlock and kitsch,
  of TV series and Reader's Digest culture, of advertising and motels, of
  the late show and the grade-B Hollywood film.&quot; 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#6" TARGET="resource window">6</A>)</font>
  And since postmodern culture (also known as media culture, consumer society,
  or information society) is thus &quot;degraded&quot; by its capitalist
  economic base, its products no longer shock or offend , as did the oppositional
  art of the Modernist avant-garde. The &quot;constitutive features&quot;
  (note the assurance of that term) of the postmodern are now described as
  follows: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>... a new depthlessness, which finds its prolongation both in contemporary
    &quot;theory&quot; and in a whole new culture of the image or the simulacrum;
    a consequent weakening of historicity, both in our relationship to public
    History and in the new forms of our private temporality, whose &quot;schizophrenic&quot;
    structure (following Lacan) will determine new types of syntax or syntagmatic
    relationships in the more temporal arts; a whole new type of emotional
    ground tone ... [and] the deep constitutive relationships of all this to
    a whole new technology, which is itself a figure for a whole new economic
    world system (FJ 6).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The &quot;new type of emotional ground tone,&quot; also called the &quot;waning
  of affect in postmodern culture&quot; (FJ 10), refers, of course, to the
  dissolution of the subject, with the consequent dissolution of &quot;unique
  style&quot; and the replacement of parody by pastiche (&quot;blank parody&quot;).</P>
  <P>I don't think I need spell out here the influence this analysis of postmodernism
  has had on the theorizing of the eighties. From Andreas Huyssen's <I>After
  the Great Divide</I> (1986), which similarly defines postmodernism, although
  less pessimistically than Jameson, as the breakdown of the modernist &quot;frontier&quot;
  between high art and mass culture, to Rosalind Krauss's scornful rejection,
  in her Introduction to the special &quot;High /Low&quot; issue of <I>October</I>
  (Spring 1991) of what she calls the &quot;sublimation model&quot; (&quot;According
  to this model, the function of art is to sublimate or transform experience,
  raising it from ordinary to extraordinary, from commonplace to unique ,
  from low to high; with the special genius of the artist being that he or
  she has the gifts to perform this function&quot;) 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#7" TARGET="resource window">7</A>)</font>,
  the discourse of postmodernism has referred, as if to a set of incontrovertible
  facts, to postmodern &quot;depthlessness,&quot; the simulacrum, the death
  of the subject, the non-differentiation of &quot;art&quot; and popular
  culture, and so on. </P>
  <P>Whether or not we adhere to these particular paradigms of the postmodern,
  it is interesting to note how the terminology of the early seventies, when
  discussions of postmodernism still had a quasi-Utopian cast, has subtly
  shifted. What David Antin and Ihab Hassan characterized as the <I>openness
  </I>associated with the postmodern (&quot;Open, discontinuous, improvisational,
  indeterminate, or aleatory structures&quot;) imperceptibly turns into &quot;depthlessness,&quot;
  with all its negative associations of mere surface, shallowness, superficiality.
  The erasure of boundaries between the traditional genres and media becomes
  the &quot;contamination&quot; of all art works by the &quot;'degraded'
  landscape of schlock and kitsch,&quot; playfulness hardens into simulacrum,
  &quot;decreation&quot; into the death of the subject (&quot;there is no
  longer,&quot; says Jameson, &quot;a self present to do the feeling,&quot;
  FJ 51), and Derridean <I>differance</I> as deferral is gradually replaced
  by the very specific difference of identity politics, difference as marker
  or label. Indeed, despite all the talk of rupture, transgression, antiformalism,
  the breaking of the vessels-- in Lyotardian terms, the delegitimation of
  the great metanarratives-- there seem to be more rules and prescriptions
  around than ever, such familiar modernist / postmodernist pairs as &quot;hierarchy
  &quot; / &quot;anarchy&quot; and &quot;Master Code&quot; /&quot;idiolect&quot;
  (see IH 91) now being called into question, ironically enough, by the establishment
  of new hierarchies and master codes--the return, we might say, of the Law
  of the Father.</P>
  <P>An important essay by Craig Owens, called &quot;The Discourse of Others:
  Feminists and Postmodernism,&quot; which appears in the Hal Foster collection
  <I>The Anti-Aesthetic</I> (1983), may serve to dramatize this subtle shift.
  In a section subtitled &quot;A Remarkable Oversight,&quot; Owens apologizes
  for the &quot;gross critical negligence&quot; of an earlier reading he
  had performed on Laurie Anderson's well-known image, in her multimedia
  performance piece <I>United States</I>, of a nude man and woman (a cartoon
  version of Adam and Eve), in which the man's right is raised at a ninety-degree
  angle while the woman, shorter than the man and hands at her sides, faces
  toward him. In the performance, Anderson's voiceover (amplified to sound
  like a male voice) tells us, &quot;In our country, we send pictures of
  our sign language into Outer Space. We are speaking our sign language in
  these pictures. Do you think that They will think his arm is permanently
  attached in this position? Or do you think They will read our signs? In
  our country, Goodbye looks just like Hello&quot; (figures 1 and 2). 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#8" TARGET="resource window">8</A>)</font></P>
  <P>Here is Owens's original commentary on this captioned image:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Two alternatives: either the extraterrestrial recipient of the message
    will assume that it is simply a picture, that is, an analogical likeness
    of the human figure, in which case<I> he </I>might logically conclude that
    male inhabitants of Earth walk around with their right arms permanently
    raised. Or <I>he</I> will somehow divine that this gesture is addressed
    to <I>him</I> and attempt to read it, in which case <I>he</I> will be stymied,
    since a single gesture signifies both greeting and farewell, and any reading
    of it must oscillate between these two extremes. The same gesture could
    also mean &quot;Halt!&quot; or represent the taking of an oath, but if
    Anderson's text does not consider these two alternatives that is because
    it is not concerned with ambiguity, with multiple meanings engendered by
    a single sign; rather two <I>clearly defined but mutually incompatible</I>
    readings are engaged in blind confrontation in such way that it is impossible
    to choose between them. (AA 60, my italics on &quot;he&quot;).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This passage represents Owens as quintessential Derridean: his source
  seems to be <I>Of Grammatology </I>or possibly <I>Writing and Difference</I>,
  and French feminist constructions, based on Lacan, still seem far away:
  witness the use of the masculine pronoun throughout. As he himself now
  confesses:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>In my eagerness to rewrite Anderson's text in terms of the debate over
    determinate versus indeterminate meaning, I had overlooked something....
    For this is, of course, an image of sexual difference, or rather, of sexual
    differentiation according to the distribution of the phallus-- as it is
    marked and then re-marked by the man's right arm, which appears less to
    have been raised than erected in greeting..... Like all representations
    of sexual difference that our culture produces, this is an image not simply
    of anatomical difference, but of the values assigned to it. Here the phallus
    is ... the signifier of privilege, of the power and prestige that accrue
    to the male in our society..... For in this (Lacanian) image, chosen to
    represent the inhabitants of Earth for the extraterrestial Other, it is
    the man who speaks,who represents mankind. The woman is only represented;
    she is (as always) already spoken for (AA 61).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Here is Owens speaking in his role as New Feminist. The sexual differentiation
  he now notes is certainly central to Anderson's cartoon (one wonders how
  Owens could have missed it the first go-round), but I am not sure its identification
  cancels out his earlier reading, with its focus on the American equation
  of &quot;Goodbye&quot; with &quot;Hello,&quot; an equation that parodies
  more than the obvious inequity of gender roles in our culture. &quot;Anderson's
  blunt question ['Do you think that They will think his arm is permanently
  attached in this position?'],&quot; writes Herman Rappaport in a discussion
  of <I>United States</I>, &quot;is expressionless, exposing the fatuousness
  of 'big science,' the silly presupposition that aliens are going to be
  able to read our 'signs.' She suggests that in a postmodern culture scientists
  are so overspecialized that when it comes to basic questions they are enormously
  obtuse. No one has noticed that saying 'hello' is exactly the same as saying
  'good-bye,' that even if aliens could read our signs, they would be confused.&quot;

   It is difficult to see how this aspect of Anderson's
  witty parody can be ignored, but Owens does ignore it in his zeal to demonstrate
  that his second reading &quot;corrects&quot; the first: <I>difference</I>
  as signifying gap (&quot;two clearly defined but mutually incompatible
  readings&quot;) thus gives way to clear-cut gender difference: it is the
  man who speaks, the woman who is always already spoken for.</P>
  <P>Is this then the New Enlightenment of third-stage (the first is exemplified
  by Antin's poetics, the second by Derridean deconstruction) postmodernism?
  And if so, what has happened to postmodernism's<I> </I>fabled <I>openness</I>
  and decenteredness? For not only is Owens telling us how to read Anderson's
  image, telling us<I>what it means</I>, as unequivocally as Brooks and Warren
  once told us what the word &quot;design&quot; means in Robert Frost's poem
  by that name, but this assertive statement (&quot;it is the man who speaks&quot;)
  is embedded in a larger discourse which is not without its own coercions.
  Owens' essay begins as follows:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Decentered, allegorical, schizophrenic...-- however we choose to diagnose
    its symptoms, postmodernism is usually treated, by its protagonists and
    antagonists alike, as a crisis of cultural authority, specifically of the
    authority vested in Western European culture and its institutions. That
    the hegemony of European civilization is drawing to a close is hardly a
    new perception; since the mid-1950s, at least, we have recognized the necessity
    of encountering different cultures by means other than the shock of domination
    and conquest (AA 57).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>But even as he makes this declaration, Owens cites the following: Levi-Strauss,
  Derrida, Ricoeur, Baudrillard, Foucault, Kristeva, and Barthes. Seven French
  theorists named within the space of two pages. And on the third page (AA
  59), the combined authority of Lacan and Foucault advances the following
  hypothesis: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The &quot;<I>modernist </I>avant-garde ... sought to transcend representation
    in favor of presence and immediacy; it proclaimed the autonomy of the signifier,
    its liberation from the &quot;tyranny of the signified&quot;; &quot;postmodernists
    instead expose the tyranny of the <I>signifier</I>, the violence of its
    law.... It is precisely at the legislative frontier between what can be
    represented and what cannot that the postmodern operation is being staged--
    not in order to transcend representation, but in order to expose that system
    of power that authorizes certain representations while blocking, prohibiting
    or invalidating others. </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Here is the move we have already observed from what is, so to speak,
  a seventies Derridean paradigm to an eighties Foucaultian-Lacanian one.
  Aside from Anderson, Owens's exempla of &quot;prohibited&quot; represen-tations
  include Martha Rosler's <I>The Bowery in Two Inadequate Descriptive </I>Systems,
  Dara Birnbaum's <I>Technology / Transformation: Wonder Woman</I>, and assorted
  photos and film stills by Sherrie Levine, Cindy Sherman, and Barbara Kruger.
  But however interesting such exempla of &quot;gender-specific&quot; artworks
  may be, it is important to note that the works of Anderson and Rosler,
  Birnbaum and Levine, Sherman and Kruger remain just that: <I>exempla</I>
  , demonstrating how valid Lacan's discussion of the Law of the Father,
  Lyotard's notion of the postmodern &quot;unrepresentable,&quot; and Foucault's
  analysis of the power system are. Ironically, then, the women artists in
  question continue to be victimized--if not by the patriarchy of modernist
  critique and the art market, then by the French theoretical model which
  their work so nicely illustrates 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#10" TARGET="resource window">10</A>)</font>. The real power,
  in other words, belongs not to the postmodern artist (Anderson, Sherman)
  but to the poststructuralist theorist whose principles validate the work.</P>
  <P>No wonder, then, that recent handbooks on postmodernism--and they are
  now legion-- reduce what was once the excitement of the Cutting Edge to
  a list of rules and prescriptions that make one almost long for the days
  of <I>Understanding Poetry</I>. Take Brenda K. Marshall's <I>Teaching the
  Postmodern</I>, published by Routledge in 1992. 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#11" TARGET="resource window">11</A>)</font>
  The Introduction opens with a page of what are evidently intended to be
  <I>parole in liberta</I>, as Marinetti dubbed them (see figure 3). Notice
  that the very first word in this &quot;visual poem&quot; is our old friend
  <I>diff&eacute;rance, </I>but there is precious little difference in this
  list of the Big Names, whether of theorists (Kristeva, Barthes, Derrida,
  Foucault, Althusser, and such American variants as Hutcheon [Linda] and
  de Lauretis [Teresa]), or fiction writers (Morrison, Carter, Rushdie, Wolf,
  Coetzee), or Big Theory Terms (genealogy, historiography, deconstruction,
  structuralism, ideology, intertextuality, subject position, Marxism, etc.).
  What is, so to speak, the poem's refrain is the word <I>language</I>, which
  appears four times! Language, it seems, is centrally important. But how?</P>
  <P>Marshall begins with the Piety of the Day: &quot;Crucial to an understanding
  of the postmodern moment is the recognition that there is no 'outside'
  from which to 'objectively' name the present.&quot; Of course not: no <I>hors
  texte</I>, no transcendental signified, no metanarrative, no essentialist
  norms by which to judge production: &quot;The postmodern moment is an awareness
  of being within, first, a language, and second, a particular historical,
  social, cultural framework.... There can be no such thing as objectivity....
  That does not mean that we are paralyzed or helpless; rather, it means
  that we give up the luxury of absolute Truths, choosing instead to put
  to work local and provisional truths.&quot; (BM 3). Having made this obligatory
  gesture to some kind of Uncertainty Principle, Marshall now proceeds briskly
  to tell us what postmodernism is all about:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Postmodernism is about language. About how it controls, how it determines
    meaning, and how we try to exert control through language. About how language
    restricts, closes down, insists that it stands for some <I>thing</I>. Postmodernism
    is about how 'we' are defined within that language, and within specific
    historical, social, cultural matrices. It's about race, class, gender,
    erotic identity and practice, nationality, age, ethnicity. It's about difference.
    It's about power and powerlessness, about empowerment, and about all the
    stages in between and beyond and unthought of.... It's about those threads
    that we trace, and trace, and trace. But not to a conclusion. To increased
    knowledge, yes. But never to innocent knowledge. To better understanding,
    yes. But never to pure insight. Postmodernism is about history. But not
    the kind of 'History' that lets us think we can know the past.... It's
    about chance. It's about power. It's about information. And more information.
    And more. And. And that's just a little bit of what postmodernism [is].(BM
    4)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Thus it is that postmodernism enters the classroom. &quot;The word postmodernism,&quot;
  adds the author, &quot;does not refer to a period or a 'movement'. It isn't
  really an 'ism'; it isn't really a thing. It's a moment but more a moment
  in logic than in time. Temporally, it's a space.&quot; (BM5). If this sounds
  more like<I>The Cat in the Hat</I> (&quot;It isn't really an 'ism'; it
  isn't really a thing&quot;) than like a serious attempt to understand what
  is happening in late twentieth-century culture, it is unfortunately not
  atypical. Nor are the exercises that follow this Introduction-- e.g., &quot;Critique
  of Representation and J. M. Coetzee's <I>Foe</I>;&quot; &quot;Critique
  of Subjectivity and Michel Tournier's <I>Friday</I>,&quot; --which dutifully
  go through the motions of reading selected contemporary novels through
  the prisms provided, once again, by Derrida and Foucault.</P>
  <P>How did we ever get ourselves into this mode of critical thinking? And
  should we therefore abandon the <B>P</B> word as useless, a word subject
  to the closure that everywhere threatens the demand for <I>difference?</I>
  If we do give up the term, moreover, can we designate our period --excuse
  me, moment-- vis-&agrave;-vis earlier moments in any meaningful way? Here
  are some tentative suggestions.</P>
  <P>The gradual but wholesale reversal of PoMo terminology between the late
  sixties and the early nineties suggests that the fin de si&egrave;cle may
  well be as different from the sixties and early seventies as those decades
  are from the twenties and thirties. Yet the standard opposition between
  Modernism and Postmodernism does not take this continuing evolution into
  account. Theorists either push Modernism further and further backward into
  the past, as do Lyotard and Habermas; this gives us three centuries of
  Modernist (Enlightenment) discourse against which to measure what is happening
  in the delegitimating present. Or we do the opposite: we push Modernism
  further and further toward the present, so as to include postwar figures
  like Beckett and Pinter, Georges Perec and <I>film noir</I>, Jackson Pollock
  and Philip Johnson, thus setting aside postmodernism as referring to German
  neo-Expressionism or cyberpunk or the performance art of the eighties.</P>
  <P>We cannot, in short, come to terms with postmodernism until we decide
  what modernism was. &quot;From the modernism that you want,&quot; David
  Antin has quipped, &quot;you get the postmodernism you deserve.&quot; If,
  for example, modernism is equated with Enlightenment discourse from the
  <I>Encyclopedia</I> to World War II, then Lyotard may well be right to
  insist that postmodernism means incredulity to the <I>grands r&eacute;cits
  </I>of progress and scientific advancement.<I> </I>If, on the other hand,
  modernism is taken to refer to the first three decades or so of the twentieth-century,
  then it is hard not to infer that any number of great modernists--Kafka,
  Brecht, Musil, Krauss, Leiris, Celine, Bataille, Pound, Stevens, Williams--
  had already lost faith in those metanarratives of knowledge and social
  justice. Again, if modernism is equated with Anglo-American modernism,
  then the attribution of order and hierarchy, organic form and autonomy,
  centering and aesthetic distance may well be applicable; if, on the other
  hand, we focus on Continental Europe, on, say, Italian Futurism and Dada,
  on Apollinaire and Cendrars, or on Klee and Tatlin, the picture is quite
  different. </P>
  <P>It is, I think, the drive toward totalization and hence toward closure
  that bedevils current discussions of postmodernism. Consider what we might
  call the Synecdochic Fallacy. In <I>Postmodernism, or,</I> <I>The </I>Cultural
  Logic of Late Capitalism, we recall, Jameson makes an extended comparison
  between Van Gogh's well-known painting of peasant shoes (figure 4), which
  he calls &quot;one of the canonical works of high modernism,&quot; and
  Andy Warhol's <I>Diamond Dust Shoes</I> (figure 5). &quot;Whether we interpret
  the Van Gogh as an &quot;act of compensation,&quot; a &quot;willed and
  violent transformation of a drab peasant object world into the most glorious
  materialization of pure color in oil paint,&quot; or, in Heideggerian terms,
  as a recreation of &quot;the whole missing object world which was once
  [the shoes'] lived context,&quot; the &quot;disclosure of what the equipment,
  the pair of peasant shoes <I>is</I> in truth&quot; and hence &quot;the
  unconcealment of [their] being,&quot; reading the painting, Jameson posits,
  is &quot;<I>hermeneutical, </I>in the sense in which the work in its inert,
  objectal form is taken as a clue or a symptom for some vaster reality which
  replaces it as its ultimate truth&quot; (FJ 8).</P>
  <P>Warhol's <I>Diamond Dust Shoes</I>, by contrast, doesn't speak to anything
  beyond itself; rather, this &quot;random collection of dead objects hanging
  together on the canvas like so many turnips,&quot; functions as a set of
  commodity fetishes. In an &quot;inversion of Van Gogh's Utopian gesture,&quot;
  Jameson argues, &quot;the external and colored surface of things-- debased
  and contaminated in advance by their assimilation to glossy advertising
  images-- has been stripped away to reveal the deathly black-and-white substratum
  of the photographic negative which subtends them&quot; (FJ 9). As such,
  Warhol's work exemplifies the &quot;new depthlessness&quot; and the &quot;waning
  of affect&quot; which Jameson, as I noted above, takes to be the distinguishing
  features of the postmodernist &quot;culture of the simulacrum&quot; (FJ
  6, 10)</P>
  <P>What interests me here is less the specific characterization of the
  respective paintings than the claim that the part ipso facto stands for
  the whole. Van Gogh's is &quot;one of the canonical works of high modernism&quot;;
  Warhol is &quot;the central figure in contemporary visual art&quot; (FJ
  8). And so a late nineteenth century painter who was one of the least appreciated
  and most cruelly marginalized artists of his own day is compared to an
  American artist who has become the icon of self-promotion, publicity, and
  commercial success. Is Warhol really Van Gogh's postmodernist counterpart
  or should we more accurately compare the former to a salon painter like
  Bougereau, who similarly knew how to manipulate the public and become a
  star? Or, to take the other side of the parallel, suppose we compare Van
  Gogh, not to Warhol but to Jasper Johns. The &quot;modernist&quot; &quot;disclosure
  of what the equipment, the pair of peasant shoes, <I>is </I>in truth,&quot;
  the emergence of the painted &quot;entity ... into the unconcealment of
  its being, by way of the mediation of the work of art,&quot; has a perfect
  counterpart in Johns' paintings of coat hangers and light bulbs, beer cans
  and paint brushes, the various <I>Alphabets </I>and number series.</P>
  <P>A Warhol silkscreen cannot, in any case, &quot;represent&quot; <I>the</I>
  postmodern any more than John Portman's Bonaventure Hotel (another Exhibit
  A in Jameson's lexicon of postmodernism; see 38-44) can represent the &quot;new
  depthlessness&quot; of architecture over against the International Style
  of Le Corbusier and Gropius. Common sense suggests that whatever the &quot;hyperspace&quot;
  of the Bonaventure is or isn't, its modernist counterpart is not a Bauhaus
  monument but, say, New York's ArtDeco Waldorf Astoria, the grand commercial
  hotel of the thirties and forties, even as the Bonaventure, with its revolving
  skytop cocktail lounge and &quot;reflective glass skin [that] repels the
  city outside&quot; (FJ 42), is a popular building of our own day. </P>
  <P>Van Gogh / Warhol; Le Corbusier/ John Portman: these would-be synecdoches,
  representing the modern and postmodern respectively also display a curious
  way of relating the European to the American. If modernism is regularly
  considered a European phenomenon; post-modernism is almost be definition
  &quot;born in the U. S. A.&quot; This means that although Van Gogh's most
  logical postmodernist successor might well be the Belgian Marcel Broodthaers,
  now recognized as a seminal figure in the development of post-conceptual
  art, pride of place must nevertheless be given to the quintessential American
  product of late capitalism, Andy Warhol. Note that neither in his discussion
  of pastiche nor in his differentiation of postmodern from modern architecture,
  does Jameson feel obliged to justify the U.S.-centrism of his position.
  Indeed, despite the lipservice currently paid to multiculturalism, one
  often has the sense that the only thing that matters in U.S. culture ...
  is U.S. culture. True, that culture is divided up into dozens of marginalized,
  disempowered, and minority subsets: the African-American, Chicano, Native-American,
  Asian-American, gay and lesbian, and so on. But the requisite for all these
  groups turns out to be U.S. citizenship: at Stanford, for example, we now
  have a course on the books in the Asian-American short story and a seminar
  on Toni Morrison is offered almost every year, but we have not had, in
  recent memory, so much as a single course in twentieth-century Italian
  poetry or the contemporary German novel or, for that matter, a course in
  the extraordinarily rich and varied literatures of Eastern Europe. </P>
  <P>&quot;What postmodernism taught us,&quot; writes David Harvey, &quot;was
  that difference and heterogeneity matter, and that the language in which
  we represent the world, the manner of discourse, ought to be the subject
  of careful reflection. But it did not teach us how to negotiate differences
  in fruitful ways, nor did it tell us how to go about the business of communicating
  with each other after we had carefully deconstructed each others' language.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#12" TARGET="resource window">12</A>)</font> We could take this a step further and argue that
  the concept of <I>difference</I>, as liberating as it seemed in the seventies,
  has now been replaced by a bland <I>diversity</I> that, as the poet Charles
  Bernstein observes in his new <I>A Poetics</I>, harks back &quot;to New
  Critical and liberal-deomcrtic concepts of a common readership that often
  ... have the effect of transforming unresolved ideological divisions and
  antagonisms into packaged tours of the local color of gender, race, sexuality,
  ethnicity, region, nation, class, even historical period: where each group
  or community or period is expected to come up with--or have appointed for
  them-- representative figures we all can know about.&quot; 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#13" TARGET="resource window">13</A>)</font></P>
  <P>Unlike difference, Bernstein argues, <I>diversity</I> &quot;presupposes
  a common standard of aesthetic judgment or implicitly aims to erect a new
  common standard. In this context, diversity can be a way of restoring a
  highly idealized concept of a unified American culture that effectively
  quiets dissent&quot; (CB 4-5). And he adds: </P>
  <P>Too often the works selected to represent cultural diversity are those
  that accept the model of representation assumed by the dominant culture
  in the first place. &quot;I see grandpa on the hill / next to the memories
  I can never recapture&quot; is the base line against which other versions
  play: &quot;I see my yiddishe mama on hester street / next to the pushcarts
  I can no longer peddle&quot; or &quot;I see my grandmother on the hill
  / next to all the mothers whose lives can never be recaptured&quot; or
  &quot;I can't touch my Iron Father / who never canoed with me / on the
  prairies of my masculine epiphany.&quot; Works that challenge these models
  of representation run the risk of becoming more inaudible than ever within
  mainstream culture. (CB 6)</P>
  <P>A similar point is made by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. in a recent essay
  for <I>American Literary History</I>. &quot;If black authors are primarily
  entrusted with producing the proverbial 'text of blackness',&quot; he writes,
  &quot;they become vulnerable to the charge of betrayal if they shirk their
  duty.... Representational democracy [here Gates is citing the black British
  filmaker Isaac Julian and the media theorist Kobena Mercer], like the classic
  realist text, is premised on an implicitly mimetic theory of representation
  as correspondence with the 'real.'&quot; 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#14" TARGET="resource window">14</A>)</font></P>
  <P>Which is to say that <I>essentialism</I> has by no means been put to
  rest and that metanarrative, far from having been abandoned, has reappeared
  in the new guise of an elaborate plot of ethnic amelioration. Consider
  the following poem published by a young Chicano poet in 1991:</P>

        <P>I loved a tree in my boyhood, a tree</P>

        <P></P>
        <P>bows which reached so low, so low</P>
        <P>the leaves brushed the grass as if to</P>

        <P>limbs around myself as if they were the</P>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Ironically, nothing in the poem except its designated locale, Las Cruces,
  New Mexico, identifies the poet's ethnicity or class. Its author, Benjamin
  Alire S&aacute;enz has taken on the most familiar of Romantic models: the
  nature poem in which a particular speaker remembers a particular incident
  that taught him a lesson--in this case, the lesson that suffering and death
  are inevitable. The beloved tree, significantly a weeping willow, predictably
  stands in &quot;my grandfather's garden; the boy predictably plays under
  its &quot;arches of leaves,&quot; and feels loved and protected by God.
  But since there is always a serpent in paradise, one spring &quot;sickness
  came&quot;; a blight struck the tree and it had to be chopped down. Its
  dismemberment, moreover, became the occasion for excessive human force:
  &quot;so harshly&quot; was the tree stump &quot;pulled from the ground&quot;
  that &quot;even the roots came up / shaking the whole garden.&quot; The
  boy who has witnessed this surgery will never be the same. </P>
  <P>Even the quatrain form of &quot;The Willow&quot; places it in the Romantic
  tradition, as it comes down to us from Wordsworth to Houseman, and as it
  no doubt came down to Benjamin S&aacute;enz in the writing workshop. Yet--in
  what we might take as a kind of postmodern give-away, the poem seems ill
  at ease with the formal constraint of the quatrain, the syntax being that
  of straightforward prose: &quot;I shouted at the tree, and told it to live,
  and though it fought to breathe without leaves, neither my voice nor the
  rain could heal it.&quot; And further: the omission of rhyme and inclusion
  of one-line units--&quot;And then sickness came,&quot; and &quot;shaking
  the whole garden&quot;-- identify &quot;The Willow&quot; as a contemporary
  poem, a poem that cannot quite reproduce the paradigm it has so earnestly
  chosen to follow.</P>
  <P>To encourage this kind of writing in the name of ethnic diversity is
  to assume that the &quot;marginalized&quot; have the right (perhaps even
  the duty) to use what would otherwise be considered well-worn clich&eacute;s
  because these groups have hitherto been denied all access to poetic speech,
  because their voices have been suppressed by the dominant culture. But
  such validation is based on the further assumption that a poem like &quot;The
  Willow&quot;<I>represents </I>Chicano poetics as such, an assumption that
  is again an instance of what I have called the synecdochic fallacy. Indeed,
  the irony is that the refusal to submit the poems of the marginalized to
  any kind of serious critique accomplishes nothing so much as the marginalization
  of poetry itself. For even as publishers are dutifully bringing out anthologies
  of Native American or Chicano or Asian-American poetry, we all know that
  the action has passed elsewhere. For every poetry review in the major papers
  and journals, there are fifty reviews of biographies, of political books,
  of media studies and self-help manuals. As for intellectuals, poetry as
  discourse cannot begin to matter in the ways that theory matters. And theory
  has, as my example from Craig Owens suggests, remained resolutely Eurocentric,
  indeed almost exclusively French and (increasingly) German. A seminar on
  Bourdieu or Habermas or on Luhmann's systems theory will draw a lot more
  students than any seminar on contemporary poetry, however oppressed the
  constituency in question. And, incidentally, Bourdieu and Habermas and
  Luhmann are all white men.</P>
  <P>And yet...to tap for a moment into a more genuine Romanticism than the
  version we find in poems like &quot;The Willow,&quot; &quot;Without Contraries
  is no progression.&quot; And again: &quot;Improvement makes strait roads;
  but the crooked roads without Improvement are roads of Genius.&quot; The
  opposition to the bland call for &quot;diversity&quot; on the one hand,
  and to the gloomy emphasis on th &quot;new depthlessness&quot; on the other,
  is coming, once again, not from the professional critics but from poets,
  with the difference that the new poets are themselves working theorists,
  like Susan Howe, whose <I>My Emily Dickinson</I> and <I>The Birthmark</I>
  weave together poetic, historical, and critical discourse, or like Steve
  McCaffery, whose <I>North of Intention</I> and <I>Rational Geomancy</I>
  : <I>The Collected Research Reports of the Toronto Research Group</I> 1973-82
  (the latter with bpNichol) take the theorems of Derrida and Lacan, Kristeva
  and Althusser for a playful spin that produces fanciful and fictive verbal/visual
  configurations as &quot;creative&quot; as they are &quot;critical.&quot;
  In a recent issue of <I>Raddle Moon</I> (#11, 1992), a section called &quot;Women
  / Writing / Theory&quot; features work by Johanna Drucker, Norma Cole,
  Laura Moriarty, and others that cannot be categorized as &quot;theory&quot;
  or &quot;poetry,&quot; the texts in question always already being &quot;both
  / and.&quot;</P>
  <P>As such, poetry is once again opening up the possibility that &quot;art&quot;
  is not, after all, equivalent to popular culture. The current wisdom, of
  course, is that postmodernism spells the end of the opposition between
  High and Low, both participating as they do in late Capitalist commodity
  production. But the notion of the breakdown of the &quot;great divide&quot;
  (Huyssen's term) has its own aporias. In <I>A Poetics</I>, Charles Bernstein
  reminds us that &quot;[Mass] movements must be considered within their
  specific geographic and sociopolitical contexts, or else neofascist Italians
  fetishizing machines will be equated with French leftists fascinated by
  the unconscious. Worse, German artists' attitudes about the mass culture
  of Weimar end up being equated with the aspirations of Russian artists
  for a <I>new</I> socialist culture, which are then equated with pop's fascination
  with American popular culture--<I>as if mass culture were </I>a unitary
  phenomenon. (CB 104).</P>
  <P><I>Unitary</I> is the key word here. Some wonderful poems have been
  written in recent years that once again defy the unitary, along with its
  offspring, the binary, as in High / Low. Lyn Hejinian's long poem <I>Oxota:
  A </I>Short Russian Novel (1991), with its 270 chapters written in mock-Pushkin
  stanzas, chronicles the <I>strangeness</I> of Russian daily life, as seen
  by an American woman visitor, who speaks some Russian, knows Russian literature,
  and is staying with Russian poet friends, but might as well be from Mars.
  Here is Chapter 120: &quot;One Spring Morning&quot;:</P>

      <P>Divination by clouds must be renounced under a colorless sky.</P>
      <P>Ostap produced a small cardboard device for divining mood</P>
      <P>A staircase</P>
      <P>The proportions of temperaments and moods</P>
      <P>Zina ran a rag over the table</P>
      <P>I turned on the gas for tea</P>
      <P>It's a blind day, Zina said</P>
      <P>Such a sky produces vast absent-mindedness</P>
      <P>Here</P>
      <P>Arkadii and then I produced gloom</P>
      <P>I too, she said</P>
      <P>The device had turned a foreboding greenish black</P>
      <P>Papa, it's just a human revelation, said Ostap-- such colors</P>
      <P>grow from temperatures and salt</P>
      <P>You see?--heliotrope means passion.

  <P>One understands the words alright (&quot;I too, she said&quot;) but
  what do they mean? The &quot;proportions of temperaments and moods&quot;
  undergo split-second shifts that Hejinian tries to capture in her subtle
  linguistic formations. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#17" TARGET="resource window">17</A>)</font> A related development may be found in a short prose
  text called &quot;Staged Dialogue with Failed Transit Actiant Opposition&quot;
  by the English-turned-Canadian poet Steve McCaffery. 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#18" TARGET="resource window">18</A>)</font>
  Here, as in Hejinian's <I>Oxota</I>, the emphasis is on defamiliarizing
  the look and sound of everyday life in the late postmodern 1990s. </P>

  <P>In one sense, the speaker of this monologue is, as in David Antin's
  prescription with which I began, &quot;a man on his feet talking,&quot;
  a successor, we might say, of Wordsworth's &quot;man speaking to men.&quot;
  Antin's own talk poems, for that matter, resemble McCaffery's in their
  fusion of &quot;poetic&quot; and &quot;theoretical&quot; discourses. But
  the syntax and structure of McCaffery's text, its refusal to privilege
  speech over writing, and its defiantly anti-poetic frames of reference,
  are so different from, say, the poetic of Charles Olson's &quot;Kingfishers&quot;
  (Antin's exhibit in the <I>boundary 2</I> essay), 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="postmod_footnotes.html#19" TARGET="resource window">19</A>)</font>
  that criticism must try to account for the difference. Can the term<I>
  </I><B>postmodernism </B>then apply both to the 60s and the 90s? Can we
  simply invert that big <B>6</B>? Or do the post-post days we are now witnessing
  prefigure a phase for which we don't yet have a name and whose postpeople
  we can't quite conceptualize? In the words of Laurie Anderson, &quot;do
  you think They will read our signs?&quot;</P>
