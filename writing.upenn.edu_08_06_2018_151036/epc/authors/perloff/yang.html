<FONT FACE="Times"> In the 1980s, &quot;language poetry&quot;
was such a dominant force in U.S. avant-garde circles that we
are only now beginning to realize that something we might designate
as &quot;post-language&quot; poetry has come into its own.  Peter
Gizzi and Elizabeth Willis, for example, studied at Buffalo and
Brown with Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, and Rosmarie Waldrop,
 yet Gizzi's &quot;Caption&quot; and Willis's &quot;Catalogue
Raisonn&eacute;&quot; are meditative lyrics that rediscover the
supposedly despised &quot;humanist subject.&quot;  Willis begins
with ekphrasis, teasing out the implications of the painting she's
looking at, but by the time we reach the lines &quot;a victim's
head contains a letter / the color of water,&quot; we know that
Willis's is a dream landscape, as doggedly literal (&quot;one
book and one boat&quot;) as it is finally enticingly impenetrable.
  Willis's lyric nicely juxtaposes the verbal and the visual,
culminating in the recognition of &quot;a change of tone where
the fabric is torn.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Peter Gizzi's  &quot;Caption&quot; takes its
epigraph from one of Ezra Pound's great favorites--Fran&ccedil;ois
Villon--a gesture that, so to speak, aligns Gizzi with Modernist
lyric.  At the same time, Gizzi's meditation on the proximity
of death, whether real or imagined, is presented in a series of
disjunctive images.  The narrative is occluded but the reader
participates in the difficulty of the threshold experience, the
coming into being of a new relationship, marked though it is by
a &quot;severed line.&quot;  &quot;Caption&quot; ends with the
recognition of difference:   &quot;Grief unlike truth, truth unlike
snow / Body unlike its outline.&quot;  Gizzi's &quot;Tous Les
Matins du Monde,&quot; similarly brings together the indeterminacy
of Ashberyian narrative (&quot;Something must be moving at incredible
speed&quot;)  with distinct Keatsian echoes, as in &quot;a distracted
mind unable to doze in fitful sleep,&quot; and an absence of &quot;explanation&quot;
that makes Gizzi's striving for self-understanding so moving.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Gizzi and Willis write an open, highly variable
free verse; by contrast, Star Black, a New York photographer who
came to poetry in the last decade, writes sonnets although their
lines rarely rhyme.  She likes the look of her three Shakespearean
quatrains and in &quot;Hoopla,&quot; she also makes the most of
the expected couplet, with its punchline, &quot;You never know
about men.&quot;  But, in the spirit of the nineties (and, like
Gizzi, Black has learned much from John Ashbery) Black produces
pastiche sonnets.  &quot;Employment&quot; is a comic send-up of
the Petrarchan love sonnet : here the speaker calculates how appropriate
it would be &quot;to love and live with an assistant professor&quot;--the
golden mean, so to speak, between the famous (the &quot;top-flight&quot;
professor) and the lowly fellow-student.  &quot;Hoopla&quot; plays
similar games with Shakespeare's <U>Tempest</U>, pondering what
Ferdinand might have accomplished if he hadn't been such a wimp
and done all of Prospero's bidding.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Cole Swensen is another post-language poet
(this time from the San Francisco area) for whom the personal
is not so much the political (as it was for such precursors Ron
Silliman and Barrett Watten) but an interior landscape one can
people with one's fantasies.  Swensen has been writing a series
of &quot;Opera Notes&quot;:  reimaginings of her favorite operas
that splice bits of narrative with song echoes and visual notations
of stage decor.  As in the case of John Cage's <U>Europeras</U>,
Swensen's opera fragments are wonderfully absurd, what with Orpheus
(not Eurydice) &quot;remain[ing] as salt,&quot;  elusive love
scenes between Salome and John the Baptist, and &quot;gorgeous&quot;
arias punctuated by irrelevant commentary.  And although her &quot;subject&quot;
is musical, her poetic impetus is visual, the placement of words
and lines in space so as to create a charged page design.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> If Swensen takes her inspiration from a traditional
form like opera, Kenneth Goldsmith, a  visual artist again with
Cagean leanings, uses specific generative devices, often chosen
by means of chance operations.  <U>Soliloquy</U> is a project
in which Goldsmith tape recorded every word he spoke for a week
from the moment he woke up Monday morning to the moment he went
to sleep Sunday night.  For the transcription, he edited every
other voice out but his own and his own was completed unedited.
 The result is a devastating tour de force:  in the extract here
we have Kenny telling someone about his adventures with his super-exensive
suit and the tailor who almost ruins it for him.  In the course
of the little narrative, we get the perfect flavor of what actual
conversation <U>sounds</U> and <U>looks</U> like, with all its
&quot;It's like it's like midnight,&quot; it's way of evading
tough issues, its racy, up-to-date, colloquial quality.  Not a
simulation of speech but speech itself:  it is not only fun to
read but one admires Goldsmith's discipline in refusing to evade
what he <U>actually </U>said, and its modes of saying.  No prettying
things up here.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Craig Dworkin, the youngest poet in the group,
is in his latetwenties, and his prose poem, &quot;The Ossature
of Memory,&quot; from which the extract here is taken, is the
most austere and paragrammatic piece in the group.  Every word
is, so to speak, x-rayed, mined for the possibilities of punning
and allusion.  Dworkin has studied Dada and Situationist poetics
carefully.  Primarily a visual poet, here he uses words as visual
counters. The opening &quot;At rain, leaves: she can go travelling&quot;
may refer to leaves in the rain or someone leaving in the rain,
even as &quot;At rain,&quot; can be respaced to read &quot;A train.&quot;
 &quot;Travelling,&quot; moreover,&quot; contains all the letters
of &quot;At rain, leaves,&quot; its sign of difference being the
single letter &quot;g.&quot;  From here on in, Dworkin proceeds
to give us remarkably acute linguistic play, ranging from echoes
of childrens' games (&quot;One potato&quot;), to mock aphorisms
(&quot;The difference between prose and promise is the insertion
of the ego&quot;), citations from Marx in the original German,
and mock recipes (About two months or until browned on top.  it
is done when a toothipick inserted in the center comes out clean.&quot;
 The first sentence &quot;At rain, leaves&quot; reappears near
the end in the &quot;normal&quot; &quot;A train leaves Chicago
travelling 60 mph.&quot;  And to remind us that we live in a world
of email, FAX, and answering machines, the poem moves to the refrain
&quot;End of messages.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> What can we expect of American poetry as we
come to the end of the century? Judging from the poems here, we
can anticipate (1) a return to narrative--but a highly fractured
variant; (2) much less resistance to the lyric &quot;I&quot; as
operative principle, (3) enormous care for the materiality of
words; the look of language as well as to the asyntactic, disjunctive
modes we have learned to expect from language poetry, and (4)
a return to literary allusion, scorned in the seventies and eighties
as too well-bred, together with a new interest in Beauty, the
aesthetic, the pleasure of the text.  It is an exciting moment
for lyric poetry.</FONT>
