<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>--John Ashbery, &quot;The Invisible Avant-Garde&quot;</FONT>
(1968)<BR>
<BR>

<P>

 Has success spoiled John Ashbery?  By no means, as I shall suggest
below, if we are talking about such recent volumes as <I>Can
You Hear, Bird</I> (1995).   But the current discourse <I>on</I>
Ashbery's work is something else again.   Now that academic critics,
who, not so long ago, dismissed Ashbery's poems as so much obscurantist
doubletalk, have been forced to concede that the Ashberyan mode
doesn't seem to be going away, that, on the contrary, its particular
modulation of voices and performative registers speaks to poetry
audiences from Austria to Australia, a new explanatory narrative
is in the making. According to this account, there's nothing so
<I>unusual</I> about Ashbery, who, so it now seems, has
all along written under the sign of Eliot or Stevens, leaving
Modernism firmly intact as the movement or epoch of choice, the
movement from which no later  twentieth-century poet (not even
Ashbery) can actually deviate.  
<P>
 A recent example of this &quot;business as usual&quot; narrative
is James Longenbach's essay &quot;Ashbery and the Individual Talent,&quot;
published in <I>American Literary History</I> (Spring 1997)
and reprinted in Longenbach's <I>Modern Poetry After Modernism</I>
(Oxford, 1997).    One of this essay's chief aims is to dismantle
the &quot;breakthrough narratives&quot; critics like myself have
misguidedly perpetuated--narratives, that is to say, that claim
that there is, for better a worse, a genuine <I>difference</I>
between modernist and postmodernist poetics.  Ashbery, Longenbach
argues, is &quot;the least oppositional of poets.&quot;   And
again, &quot;However distinctive his own poems have seemed, Ashbery
has stayed resolutely in motion, refusing to choose sides in the
debates that preoccupied so many American poets [e.g., Olson,
Ginsberg] after modernism&quot; (ALH 105).  Unlike Olson, for
example, Ashbery did not reject &quot;closed verse,&quot; often
using such elaborate traditional metrical forms as the sestina
and the pantoum.  
<P>
 &quot;To make the case for any sort of Ashbery &quot;breakthrough&quot;
(and, in a larger sense, postmodernist breakthrough) Longenbach
argues, can result only from positing a &quot;weak modernism,&quot;
a modernism whose poetics are more coherent, explicable, and accessible
than Ashbery's curiously opaque and resistant structures.  But
modernism, far from being thus &quot;weak,&quot; Longenbach reminds
us, was itself enormously oblique and complex, and conversely,
Ashbery's poems--at least some of them--are more unified and amenable
to normal explication than the poet's early defenders had claimed.
  Indeed, Ashbery's poetic is best understood as what he himself
called, in the poem &quot;Clouds&quot; from <I>The Double Dream
of Spring</I>, a &quot;worried continuing&quot; (ALH 107).
 True, many of his poems, especially in the notorious <I>Tennis
Court Oath</I> (1962) but also in the case of the often &quot;tedious&quot;
<I>Flow Chart</I>, resist interpretation:  of &quot;Leaving
the Atocha Station,&quot; Longenbach writes: &quot;The power of
the poem stems from the fact that, like a Jackson Pollock painting,
it is basically unacceptable.  For all of its aura of the prodigious
feat, &quot;Leaving the Atocha Station&quot; might be the warped
but inevitable conclusion of a debased New Critical aesthetic:
the poem that does not mean, but is&quot;  (ALH 114).   But, much
to Longenbach's relief, there are Ashbery poems like &quot;Decoy&quot;
that make fairly straightforward sense.   He admits that &quot;Ashbery
himself is oddly resistant to any preference for his more explicable
poems&quot; (ALH 119), but this is not to say that the reader
can't prefer those that are, as Longenbach himself so evidently
does.
<P>
 A related argument about Ashbery,  but one that does acknowledge
the poet's &quot;difficulty&quot;, is Vernon Shetley's essay in
a book ominously called <I>After the Death of Poetry: Poetry
and Audience in Contemporary America</I> (1993).  In Shetley's
scheme of things, the three significant American postwar poets
are Ashbery, Bishop, and Merrill;  he has no use for &quot;language
poets&quot; on the one hand, &quot;new formalists,&quot; on the
other,  and, among contemporaries, finds little to praise beyond
scattered lyrics by such poets as Robert Hass, David Ferry, and
Alan Shapiro.   Given these parameters, he is forced to conclude
that &quot;Poetry is dead.  With that judgment I have no interest
in arguing, if what it means is that poetry is unlikely in any
foreseeable future to regain an audience like the one enjoyed
by Tennyson, or even by Frost.  But it seems to me that poetry
still has an enormous job of work to do, posthumously, as it were.
 If nothing else, poetry's death should haunt the rest of the
culture.&quot;   
<P>
 But why, in this depressing narrative of poetic loss, is Ashbery
given a whole chapter?   Like Longenbach, Shetley is relieved
to find that &quot;Even though Ashbery shared with the Beat and
Projectivist camps a disaffection from the reigning academic modernism,
he rejected both the progessive model of literary change they
espoused and the heroic self-image they cultivated&quot; (VS 107).
  The reference here is again to verse form--Ashbery's writing
of sonnet, sestina, cento, pantoum, etc.  Indeed, Shetley notes
with some satisfaction, &quot;Ashbery did not appear in the leading
antiformalist anthology, Donald Allen's <I>The New American
Poetry</I>&quot; (VS 107).  
<P>
 This last sentence, I must admit, took my breath away when I
read it because it is of course incorrect.  Ashbery is very much
included in Allen's anthology (he gets ten pages), even though
in 1959, when <I>The New American Poetry</I>  was put together,
he had published only one book, <I>Some Trees </I>(1956).
  Far from being a casual error, Shetley's is highly revealing:
 it indicates that he has never so much as leafed through Allen's
groundbreaking anthology.   What this particular clinamen tells
us is that, like Longenbach, Shetley can only deal with an Ashbery
safely sanitized and removed from his own poetic milieu.  
<P>
 And yet, as Shetley, unlike Longenbach admits, there is that
nagging &quot;difficulty.&quot;  How to account for that?  &quot;The
difficulty of [Ashbery's] poetry,&quot; Shetley explains, &quot;arises
in great measure from [the] decision not to write the sort of
poem [Robert] Lowell was writing, not to produce within the paradigms
offered by the New Criticism.&quot; (VS 104).    Again, a curious
account of poetic evolution, implying as it does that one can
simply <I>decide</I>, as an act of will, to write a certain
kind of poem.  Ashbery, I would posit, could no more have written
a Lowell poem than, say, a Mayakovsky one, his sensibility, ethos,
and culture being so different.  There is, to begin with, the
issue of Ashbery's particular gay sensibility, which would hardly
have been at ease in the  documentary confessional mode of <I>Life
Studies</I>.   But since Ashbery's problem was &quot;that
of finding an audience at all&quot; (VS 109). he evidently decided
to begin (again, a conscious choice is posited) &quot;in the earlier
avant-garde fashion of assembling a coterie&quot; (VS 109).  
 Fortunately, he soon moved beyond that coterie, returning, at
least in some of his poems like &quot;Soonest Mended,&quot; to
a more assimilable romantic lyric mode.  But, Shetley admits,
not entirely assimilable: &quot;Ashbery's romanticism remains
tempered by the presence in his poetry of all those moments that
trouble and question the pure voice of the lyric singer.  The
poetry becomes, then, imbued with a kind of second-order pathos,
in which its difficulty--its moments of fragmentation and opacity--reads
as an index of the frustrations of the poet's situation&quot;
(VS 132).  And there it is--the rueful recognition that, as Longenbach
argues, postmodernist poetry, far from being any sort of breakthrough,
is an attenuated modernism--sometimes, as in Ashbery's more accessible
poems, quite successful and moving, but more often &quot;frustrating&quot;
in its index tothe larger poetic failure of the late twentieth
century.
<P>
 The critique of &quot;breakthrough&quot; narratives of postmodernism
--now quite common in academic discussions of twentieth-century
poetics--strikes me as curiously ahistorical.   It is, to begin
with, impossible to write sympathetically about one's own moment
in poetry  without positing a &quot;breakthrough&quot; of sorts.
 When Pound first praised &quot;Prufrock&quot; and campaigned
for <I>The Waste Land</I>, of course he exaggerated the
poems' novelty: fifty years after the fact, scholars can find
many connections between Eliot and Tennyson just as there are
important links between Pound and Browning.  Within fifty years
of Wordsworth's <I>Preface to Lyrical Ballads</I> of 1798,
readers noted that in fact the poetic language of Wordsworth's
later poems was not all that different from the despised &quot;poetic
diction&quot; of Thomas Gray and other later eighteenth century
poets.  And now that language poetry has been around for twenty
years, we can see that the call for the elimination of the lyrical
ego must be understood as a reaction to the &quot;tell it like
it is&quot; mode of the seventies' workshop poem rather than as
a rejection of &quot;voice&quot; as such.  
<P>
 Thus, when Longenbach urbanely argues that, after all, Ashbery
is very much a poet in the Eliot tradition, he is ignoring the
plain fact that he himself did not come to Ashbery until quite
recently.  Indeed, Ashbery attained almost no recognition prior
to the publication of <I>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror</I>,
published in 1976 when the poet was fifty.  It was only after
the relatively accessible title poem of this volume became well-known,
that the Establishment started to come around.  And even then,
it had to do so by erasing such troubling volumes as <I>The
Tennis Court Oath</I> (1962), and, in Longenbach's case (see
ALH 114), <I>As We Know</I> (1979), <I>Shadow Train</I>
(1981), and that loose baggy monster <I>Flow Chart</I>
(1991).   Indeed, the &quot;acceptable&quot; poems, both for Longenbach
and Shetley almost always come from <I>The Double Dream of
Spring</I> (1970), which contains the lyrics like &quot;Soonest
Mended,&quot; most readily assimilable to a Modernist poetic.
<P>
 Breakthrough narratives, it is true, are always forced to simplify
the work of the past from which the new text deviates.   I plead
guilty to this charge in my own references to Eliot or Stevens
in <I>The Poetics of Indeterminacy</I> (1981).  Of course
the symbolic structure of <I>The Waste Land</I> is not
as easily understood as I implied in that study, but I stand by
my original distinction between the &quot;logic of metaphor&quot;
(Eliot's phrase for St. John Perse) of <I>The Waste Land </I>
and the much greater indeterminacy of the Ashbery lyric in question,
&quot;These Lacustrine Cities&quot; from <I>Rivers and Mountains</I>
(1966).   Indeed, however great the debt Ashbery owes to the &quot;modernism&quot;
of Eliot, one would never, as I suggested in my book, mistake
an Ashbery poem for an Eliot one.  Nor can one take short extracts
from a given Ashbery poem (Longenbach does this with reference
to passages about poetry like the lines from &quot;Syringa&quot;
that begin &quot;Its subject / Matters too much and not enough&quot;)
and treat these extracts as containing within themselves the &quot;meaning&quot;
of the poem in question.
<P>
 Take one index to the difference between Ashbery and Eliot: the
use of citation.  In Eliot's case, we know (or can find out) where
the citations come from; we can assess the degree of irony in
the poet's use of Nerval's &quot;Le Prince d'Aquitaine &agrave;
la tour abolie&quot; or in &quot;The Game of Chess's&quot; version
of Ovid's tale of Philomela.  But in Ashbery's poetry, it is usually
impossible to identify the citation, and, even when we do, such
identification doesn't necessarily help us to understand the poem.
 For example, even when we know that the source for &quot;Daffy
Duck in Hollywood&quot; is Chuck Jones's cartoon <I>Duck Amuck</I>
of 1953 (see Shetley 125), the poet's <I>attitude</I> to
that cartoon world is by no means clear or consistent.  Indeed,
in Ashbery, almost everything <I>sounds</I> like a citation,
sounds like something we've heard before or read somewhere--but
where?  And that is of course one of the main features of Ashbery's
poetic: living at a moment when one's language is so wholly permeated
by the discourses that endlessly impinge on it, a Keatsian image
complex, or even an Eliotic distinction between citation and invention--the
distinction, say, between the Dantean epigraph (&quot;<I>S'io
credesse</I>. . .&quot;) of &quot;Prufrock&quot; and the later
reference to those lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of
windows&quot;--is felt to be no longer possible.  
<P>
 Consider the opening poem in Ashbery's most recent volume, <I>Can
You Hear, Bird?</I> (New York:  Farrar Straus,1995):<BR>

<P>
Is this an example of the &quot;worried continuing&quot; Longenbach
finds the trademark of postmodern poetry?  Are the references
to omens, signs, and horoscopes a belated version of the  Madame
Sosostris sequence in <I>The Waste Land</I>?  Or might
&quot;A Day at the Gate&quot; more properly read in the context
of other poems of the nineties-- Charles Bernstein's &quot;Dark
City,&quot; say, &quot;or Clark Coolidge's <I>At Egypt</I>?
 
<P>
 Ashbery's &quot;poem beginning with 'A'&quot; (the lyrics in
<I>Can You Hear, Bird</I> are arranged in alphabetical
sequence by title) displays Ashbery's characteristic mix of the
casual and the ominous:  &quot;A Day at the Gate&quot; recalls
titles like &quot;A Day in the Country,&quot; or &quot;A Day at
the Farm.&quot;  But &quot;a day at the gate&quot; more specifically
invokes the gates of heaven or hell--at the least, some sort of
threshold experience, a waiting period that marks the entrance
to something else or a period of supplicancy, of hoping to enter
an unspecified realm.   The &quot;loose and dispiriting / wind&quot;
of the opening lines is, Longenbach might say, a familiar enough
Romantic image, but here nature and culture are in conspiracy,
the wind taking over &quot;from the grinding of traffic&quot;
and blowing in &quot;clouds&quot; of polluted air &quot;from the
distillery.&quot;  The omens now become increasingly absurd: &quot;Ocarina
sales plummeted,&quot; the poet tells us as if he were reporting
a major Wall Street disaster.  But the ocarina, an inexpensive
musical wind instrument otherwise known as &quot;sweet potato&quot;
because of its shape, is hardly a sales item to be reckoned with
in the financial pages.
<P>
 What is the tone of this stanza?  In Eliot, interpretive possibilities
are enormous but I don't think anyone would argue that the <I>The
Waste Land</I> valorizes the &quot;heap of broken images,
where the sun beats, / And the dead tree gives no shelter,&quot;
or that the poet is on the side of the &quot;young man carbuncular
. . . A small house-agent's clerk, with one bold stare.&quot;
 But in Ashbery,  parody is so thorough-going that one cannot
be sure how the speaker (and hence the reader) positions himself
vis-&agrave;-vis those ominous signs.   The landscape seems at
once frightening and funny and one pictures the poet telling a
friend what a crazy day he's just had, without being overly upset
about it.  &quot;Believe you me it was a situation / Aladdin's
lamp might have ameliorated&quot;:  the poet laughs at himself,
wishing he could get out of whatever it is he has to do. The next
three lines invoke a scene in the physician's waiting-room.  We
all know the picture:  the view of high-rises outside the window
(architecture), the magazines and dusty tanks of &quot;recycled
fish,&quot; the apprehension of waiting to find out about one's
electrocardiogram or CAT-scan (waiting the wear and tear / to
show up on my chart&quot;).  &quot;Good luck&quot;:  it's what
we tell ourselves In the waiting-room.
<P>
 But here further clowning takes place.  Good luck&quot; modulates
into the French <I>bonne chance</I> and the absurdity of
&quot;Remember me to the zithers / and their friends, the ondes
martenot.&quot;  &quot;Zithers&quot; recalls such names as &quot;Smithers&quot;;
metonymically, moreover, zither sounds fit nicely with those operatic
&quot;ondes martenot.&quot;  And then &quot;Only I say&quot; presents
the poet in the posture of cartoon Tiresias, a prophet who declaims
bathetically: &quot;What comes this way withers / automatically,&quot;
the rhyme &quot;zithers&quot;/ &quot;withers&quot; underscoring
the futility of grand pronouncements.   For what is it that is
prophesied in the midst of this fog?  The charts (medical charts?
 horoscopes?) now transform into &quot;an empire's classified
documents&quot;:  perhaps the waiting room is really at the C.I.A.
or other spy agency.  Signs continue to be taken for wonders like
that &quot;one mercurical teardrop.&quot;  The &quot;angles of
waiting,&quot;  in any case, are finally interrupted by the appearance
of a &quot;he&quot;-- &quot;Tall, pissed-off, / dressed in this
day's clothes, / holding its umbrella, he half turned away with
a shooshing sound.&quot;  The adjective sequence &quot;Tall, pissed-off&quot;
is an Ashbery signature: the conjunction of neutral description
with colloquial characterization, the shift of linguistic codes
further compounded by the curious use of &quot;its&quot; where
we would expect &quot;his,&quot; the umbrella thus belonging 
to the day, not the person.  And it is also characteristic of
Ashbery that there is no way of knowing who the &quot;tall, pissed-off&quot;
man with the umbrella, who &quot;half turned away / with a shooshing
sound&quot; might be. &quot;Said he needed us. / Said the sky
shall be kelly green tonight.&quot;  Something, it seems, is about
to happen, but the adjectives &quot;shooshing&quot; and  &quot;kelly
green&quot; undercut the line's ominous potential.
<P>
 &quot;A Day at the Gate&quot; is vintage Ashbery in its refusal
to make clear whether its &quot;theme&quot; is serious or comic
or both.  And that, the poet--a poet whose skepticism is finally
much more radical than was Eliot's-- suggests is how life is.
 True to its title, &quot;A Day at the Gate&quot; doesn't <I>comment</I>
on the disclosure that occurs or doesn't occur on the day in question;
rather, it <I>presents</I> what such a paradigmatic day
feels like.  The poem taps into our own experience, allowing us
to fill in the blanks in a variety of ways.  Which is not at all
to say that this poem doesn't mean but is.  
<P>
 Let's come back a moment to that rhyme &quot;zithers&quot; /
&quot;withers&quot; in the third stanza.  Both Longenbach and
Shetley argue that Ashbery is more &quot;traditional&quot; (and
hence, in their view, superior) to his &quot;open form&quot; counterparts
represented in Donald Allen's <I>New American Poetry. </I>
But the one-time rhyme, embedded in the internally rhyming and
alliterating &quot;Only I say:  What comes this way. . .&quot;
is designedly comic and parodic, just as are Ashbery's centos,
pantoums, and sestinas.  Indeed, the poems in <I>Can You Hear,
Bird</I> are closer in tone to Alfred Jarry, Ronald Firbank,
and the early Auden than to Eliot or Stevens or the Romantics.
 
<P>
 In criticizing the &quot;contingency&quot; of Ashbery's more
disjunctive poems (e.g., in <I>The Tennis Court Oath</I>),
Longenbach  compares Ashbery to Elizabeth Bishop:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> &quot;In Bishop's 'In the Waiting Room' a child
realizes for the first time that selfhood is an arbitrary social
construction, that experience as it comes to her has no coherent
order or meaning.  Bishop does not embody this realization in
a poem that is 'consequently' incoherent or arbitrary: she remains
perfectly comfortable with a simple narrative, aware that its
shape is, like all systems of meaning, arbitrary but nevertheless
useful</FONT>&quot; (ALH 113).  
<P>
And Longenbach contrasts that &quot;usefulness&quot; to the &quot;potential
danger . . . an aesthetic of embodiment rther than description&quot;
poses for Ashbery.   But &quot;useful&quot; for what purpose?
 My own sense is that Bishop's waiting room, where the child,
coming upon the photographs of &quot;black, naked women&quot;
with &quot;horrifying&quot; hanging breasts in the pages of the
<I>National Geographic</I>, comes to the recognition that
&quot;you are an <I>I</I>, / you are an <I>Elizabeth</I>,
/ you are one of <I>them</I>&quot;), is not nearly as interesting
or suggestive as Ashbery's, with its recycled fish and fear of
unknown &quot;charts.&quot;  Bishop's drive, in this case at least,
toward meaningful statement is characteristic of modernism in
its late phase.   But Ashbery's poem is doing something else--establishing,
for one thing, a different relationship between writer and reader,
a relationship that looks ahead to the poetics of &quot;embodiment&quot;
as practiced by such later poets as Charles Bernstein and Bruce
Andrews, Maggie O'Sullivan and Karen MacCormack.   Ashbery's is
thus less a &quot;worried continuing&quot; than the recognition
that, in the words of &quot;Syringa,&quot; &quot;All other things
must change too.&quot;<BR>
