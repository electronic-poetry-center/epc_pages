<A NAME="1"></A><B>1. </B>In <I>The Roaring Silence</I>, David Revill notes
that &quot;It was also in the <I>Imaginary Landscape</I> that Cage first
employed his system of rhythmic structure. The simple figures that constitute
the piece fit into a scheme of four sections consisting of three times five
measures which are separated by interludes which increase in length additively
from one to three measures; the piece ends with a four-measure coda (65-66).<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="2"></A><B>2.</B> The English version, <I>For the Birds, John Cage
in conversation with Daniel Charles</I>, was published by Marion Boyars
(Boston and London) in 1981. The actual interviews were begun in 1968 but
were submitted by Charles to Cage for revision and commentary and not published
until 1976 under the title <I>Pour les oiseaux</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="3"></A><B>3.</B> The <I>I Ching or Book or</I> <I>Book of Changes</I>
has, of course, been a source book for many poets and artists. Cage's own
use of the <I>I Ching </I>began in 1950, when Christian Wolff gave him the
new Bollingen (Princeton) two-volume edition of the English translation
by Cary F. Baynes of Richard Wilhelm's German translation with the introduction
by C. G. Jung. The magic square of 64 hexagrams, Cage explains in &quot;Tokyo
Lecture,&quot; transferred to the computer, &quot;works musically to tell
me for instance how many sound events take place in what length of time,
at what points in time, on which instruments, having what loudnesses, etc.
And in my writing it lets me continue, in a variety of ways, my search for
a means which comes from ideas but is not about them but nevertheless produces
them free of my intentions&quot; (pp. 178-79). Mac Low has used similar
techniques, first by throwing coins and dice, later with the computer, to
determine factors of 64 that govern individual lineation and stanzaic structure.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4"></A><B>4.</B> See, for example, John Cage, <I>Roaratorio, An
Irish Circus on Finnegans Wake</I>, p. 173.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="5"></A><B>5.</B> Cage was not satisfied with his &quot;writing
through&quot; of Pound's <I>Cantos</I>. &quot;Now that I've done so [i.e.,
&quot;written through&quot; them],&quot; he remarks in an interview, &quot;I
must say that I don't regard them as highly as I do the <I>Wake</I>. The
reason is that there are about four or five ideas that keep reappearing
in the <I>Cantos</I>, so that in the end the form resembles something done
with stencils, where the color doesn't really change. There's not that kind
of complexity, or attention to detail, as there is in Joyce&quot;; see Richard
Kostelanetz, <I>Conversing with Cage</I>, p. 152.<BR>
<BR>
No doubt, Cage also objected to Pound's studious elimination of the very
words Cage himself liked best-- prepositions, conjunctions, articles, pronouns--and
that Pound's parataxis of nouns and noun phrases made any &quot;writing
through&quot; extremely difficult. Much more suitable for his purposes was
Allen Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot;; I have written of Cage's brilliant deconstruction
of that poem in &quot;A Lion in Our Living Room: Reading Allen Ginsberg
in the Eighties,&quot; <I>Poetic License: Essays in Modernist and </I>Postmodernist
Lyric, pp. 219-22. <BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="6"></A><B>6.</B> On the piece as a whole, see my &quot;'A Duchamp
Unto Myself': Writing Through Marcel,&quot; in <I>John Cage: Composed in
America. <BR>
<BR>
</I><A NAME="7"></A><B>7.</B> For Cage's account of the evolution and design
of &quot;Art Is Either a Complaint or Do Something Else,&quot; see Retallack,
pp. 109-114. Unlike &quot;What You Say. . .&quot;, this piece is based on
separate statements made by Johns, appearing in different contexts.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="8"></A><B>8.</B> These program notes were not included in the printed
version in <I>Formations,</I> evidently because there is no way the instructions
could be followed during a silent reading of the text. What status, then,
does the printed text have? It is, we might say, a score that must be activated,
an incomplete verbal-visual construct that needs to be &quot;audiated.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="9"></A><B>9.</B> I am not counting &quot;different&quot; or &quot;interests&quot;
because in standard American speech (and certainly in Jasper Johns's Southern
idolect) both words are pronounced as having only two syllables: &quot;dif-rent,&quot;
&quot;in-trests.&quot; The seven words are &quot;another&quot; (used twice),
&quot;tendency,&quot; &quot;occupy,&quot; &quot;suddenly,&quot; &quot;inserted,&quot;
&quot;situation,&quot; and &quot;miniaturized.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>10.</B> Again, syllable count is not the same in the
oral performance as in the written. When spoken, &quot;miniaturized&quot;
usually has four syllables: &quot;min-ya-tyuw-riyzd.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="11"></A><B>11.</B> Cage's reading of this and related mesostics
is, in many ways, inimitable, his soft, neutral California speech rhythms
giving the pattern of sounds and silences of the lineated text an edge not
quite duplicatable when anyone else (myself included) reads the &quot;score.&quot;<BR>
