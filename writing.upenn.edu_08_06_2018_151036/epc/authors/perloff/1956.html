  <P>This much anthologized poem <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#2" TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</FONT>
  provides us with an interesting index to Establishment poetics in the mid-fifties.
  Its thirty lines are divided into six five-line stanzas, the meter being
  predominantly iambic pentameter (&quot;S&oacute;me are in sm&oacute;cks:
  but tr&uacute;ly th&eacute;re they &aacute;re&quot;), with some elegant
  variation, as when a line is divided into steps (see lines 4, 15, 18, 30),
  presumably to create a more natural look. A similar effect is gained by
  the absence of end rhyme, although there is a good deal of alliteration
  and assonance (e.g., &quot;And <I>s</I>pirited from <I>s</I>leep, the a<I>s</I>t<I>ou</I>nded
  <I>sou</I>l&quot;).</P>
  <P>&quot;You must imagine,&quot; Wilbur remarked in an interview, &quot;the
  poem as occurring at perhaps seven-thirty in the morning; the scene is
  a bedroom high up in a city apartment building; outside the bedroom window,
  the first laundry of the day is being yanked across the sky and one has
  been awakened by the squeaking pulleys of the laundry-line.&quot; <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="1956_footnotes.html#3" TARGET="resource window">3</A>)</FONT> What interests me here is the pronoun
  &quot;one.&quot; Indeed, in the opening stanza, the references are to &quot;The
  eyes,&quot; not &quot;My eyes,&quot; to &quot;the astounded soul,&quot;
  not to &quot;my&quot; astounded soul. The claims the poem will evidently
  make are for the universality of the experience described. Or so it struck
  three poet-critics--Richard Eberhart, Robert Horan, and May Swenson-- who
  responded to Wilbur's poem in Anthony Ostroff's anthology <I>The Contemporary
  Poet as Artist and Critic</I>. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#4" TARGET="resource window">4</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>&quot;The important thing about Wilbur's poem,&quot; writes Eberhart,
  &quot;is that it celebrates the immanence of spirit in spite of the 'punctual
  rape of every blessed day.' The conflict is between a soul-state and an
  earth-state. The soul wins. The soul, felt as a vision of angelic laundry
  on awakening, must still be incorporated into the necessities and imperfections
  of everyday reality. Man is redeemed by the angelic vision&quot; (AO 4).
  In the last two stanzas, as Robert Horan adds, &quot;the soul (like the
  laundry emptied of too seraphic a breath), <I>descends</I> to <I>accept</I>
  the <I>waking </I>body, even though it be in <I>bitter love</I>&quot; (AO
  7) Indeed, the poem moves toward the &quot;<I>acceptance</I> of the fact
  that the sweating, ruined, half-penitent world must be clothed with our
  compassion. The angel must become human, as heaven must become the street
  where we walk&quot; (AO 8).</P>
  <P>The ideal, for Horan and his fellow poet-critics, is the &quot;difficult
  balance&quot; of the poem's last line, the balance between body and soul,
  the material and the spiritual, the disembodied angels and the &quot;heaviest
  nuns walk[ing] in a pure floating / of dark habits.&quot; &quot;The modern
  lyric,&quot; declares May Swenson in her commentary, &quot;is autonomous,
  a separate mobile . . . an enclosed construct . . . a package individually
  wrapped&quot; (AO 12). Such an individual package depends upon the careful
  control of tensions and balances. Notice, for example, the tension between
  words of stress (&quot;pulleys,&quot; &quot;hangs,&quot; &quot;shrinks,&quot;
  &quot;gallows&quot;) and those of rest (&quot;calm swells,&quot; &quot;impersonal
  breathing,&quot; yawns),&quot; between white (&quot;angels,&quot; &quot;water,&quot;
  &quot;steam,&quot; &quot;linen,&quot; &quot;pure&quot;) and red (&quot;rape,&quot;
  &quot;rosy,&quot; &quot;warm look,&quot; &quot;love,&quot; &quot;ruddy&quot;).
  &quot;The whole poem,&quot; writes Swenson, &quot;is in fact an epitome
  of relative weight and equipoise&quot; (AO 16).</P>
  <P>The Age Demanded such equipoise, an equipoise, epitomized in 1956, in
  the poetry world of the <I>Kenyon Review</I>, <I>Partisan Review</I>, <I>Sewanee
  Review</I>, and so on, by metaphysical poetry, especially that of John
  Donne, and, more immediately for Wilbur, by the Yeats of &quot;Sailing
  to Byzantium,&quot; who referred to the soul as &quot;clap[ping] its hands&quot;
  and singing. Responding gratefully to his three readers, Wilbur adds that
  there are also important allusions in his poem: the title, for example,
  comes from St. Augustine. And he adds: &quot;Plato, St. Theresa, and the
  rest of us in our degree having known that it is painful to return to the
  cave, to the earth, to the quotidian; Augustine says it is love that brings
  us back. That is why the love of line 23 has got to be bitter--for the
  sake of psychological truth&quot; (AO 18). As for Robert Horan's mild disclaimer
  that the poem is somewhat &quot;fastidious&quot; and &quot;remote,&quot;
  Wilbur counters, &quot;I've always agreed with Eliot's assertion that poetry
  'is not the expression of personality but an escape from personality'&quot;
  (AO 19). Hence, evidently, all those references to &quot;one&quot; and
  to &quot;the astounded soul.&quot;</P>
  <P>Depersonalization, ambiguity, tension, paradox. We need not dwell here
  on the merits (or lack thereof) of these New Critical values, for they
  are only too well known. Rather, what interests me about the laundry-as-angel
  metaphor, which is the heart of Wilbur's poem, is its curious inaccuracy.
  &quot;The incident,&quot; writes May Swenson, &quot;is so common that everyone
  has seen it, and . . . the analogy is . . . fitting in each of its details:
  a shirt is white, it is empty of body, but floats or flies, therefore has
  life (an angel)&quot; (AO 13). But if, as Wilbur himself explains it, the
  scene is outside the upper-story window of an apartment building, in front
  of which &quot;the first laundry of the day is being yanked across the
  sky,&quot; the reality is that the sheets and shirts would probably be
  covered with specks of dust, grit, maybe even with a trace or two of bird
  droppings. At best, those sheets seen (if seen at all) from Manhattan highrise
  windows in the fifties, billowing over the fire-escapes under the newly
  installed TV aerials, would surely be a bit on the grungy side.</P>
  <P>But of course the awakening poet might not notice this because the laundry
  that, as Wilbur puts it, &quot;is being yanked across the sky,&quot; as
  if by some blind external force, is certainly not his concern; the poet,
  after all, is represented as having been asleep when it was hung out to
  dry. Richard Eberhart seems to be aware of this aloofness when he remarks
  that Wilbur's &quot;is a man's poem. Certainly not all women would like
  a laundry poem which pays no heed to hard work and coarsened hands. They
  might say, poet, have your ruddy dream, but give us better detergents&quot;
  (AO 5). A remarkable fifties statement, this, in its assumption that woman
  is she who has &quot;coarsened hands&quot; from doing the laundry, while
  man, that ruddy dreamer, can view that same laundry as angelic. Or, to
  turn the dichotomy around, woman is she who only dreams of better detergents--a
  dream, by the way, the affluent fifties were in the process of satisfying--
  whereas man dreams idealistically (and hence hopelessly) of &quot;clear
  dances done in the sight of heaven,&quot; dances that might allow him to
  escape, at least momentarily, &quot;the punctual rape of every blessed
  day.&quot;</P>
  <P>&quot;Punctual rape&quot;: it is the alarm clock going off, violating
  one's delightful daydreams, even as Donne's &quot;busie old foole, unruly
  Sunne&quot; intrudes, through windows and curtains, on the sleeping lovers
  in &quot;The Sunne Rising.&quot; But in Wilbur's poem the intruding daylight
  is not chided, evidently because to be alive, however difficult, is to
  be blessed. The metaphor will not withstand much scrutiny, for here, as
  in the case of the laundry metaphor, the drive is to get beyond the image
  as quickly as possible, so as to talk about the relation of soul to body,
  spirit to matter--those great poetic topoi introduced by the Augustine-derived
  title, &quot;Love Calls us to the Things of This World.&quot; The actual
  &quot;things of this world,&quot; in 1956, it turns out, are studiously
  avoided. The poem refers to &quot;rosy hands in the rising steam&quot;--no
  doubt, as Eberhart remarks, an allusion to Homer's &quot;rosy-fingered
  dawn&quot; (AO 4), but where are the real hands of those laundresses, hands
  that Eliot, half a century earlier, had seen &quot;lifting dingy shades
  in a thousand furnished rooms?&quot;</P>
  <P>Let us look at another image of the &quot;things of this world,&quot;
  circa 1956, this one not from a poem but from Robert Frank's book of photographs
  called <I>The Americans</I>, published by Grove Press in 1959, with a preface
  by Jack Kerouac. <I>The Americans</I> was the fruit of a cross-country
  trip, funded by a Guggenheim fellowship; its eighty-two images, culled
  from more than twenty thousand frames <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#5" TARGET="resource window">5</A>)</FONT>,
  range from Butte, Montana to Beaufort, South Carolina, from New Orleans
  to New York. Here is Frank's first picture, captioned <I>Parade--Hoboken,
  New Jersey</I> [Figure 1].</P>
  <P>Like Wilbur's &quot;Love Calls Us,&quot; this photograph positions the
  viewer/ reader at a window. But here the focus is not on what is seen (and
  metaphorized) outside the window but on those who are looking out and on
  the frame from within which they look (or don't look). Presumably these
  residents of Hoboken are watching a parade passing by below-- perhaps,
  as the presence of the flag suggests, a Veterans Day or Memorial Day parade.
  But who are these viewers? On the left is an elderly woman with blankly
  staring eyes; she wears what looks like a flowered house dress, and on
  her left, all but hidden by a curtain, we see an elbow encased in a sleeve
  made of the same fabric. Two women, then, in some sort of uniform, perhaps
  the insignia of inmates of an institution But the woman in the right-hand
  window, whose face is covered by the flag, is dressed differently; she
  wears a loose jacket or coat, and her upper hand looks like a prosthesis.
  Is the building a prison? A hospital? An old age home? Or just an apartment
  house? The picture is at once wholly literal and yet enigmatic: indeed,
  Frank may not know himself what it is he is shooting.</P>
  <P>Interestingly, his photograph exhibits a symmetry that might be compared
  to the &quot;difficult balance&quot; of Wilbur's last line. The rectangular
  windows to the left and right meet the edges of the frame, the right one
  being cropped. The composition is divided into three almost equal parts,
  window, brick wall, window. Further, the horizontal rectangles--bricks,
  window sills, partially lowered shade in left window, and large billowing
  flag (which continues the lower border of the window shade)--create a deceptive
  grid structure--deceptive because although the windows balance one another,
  the figures within them do not. The accent, in any case, is on separation--of
  one body part from another, inside from outside, the flag from the patriotic
  event it supposely signifies, the viewers from the viewed. The framing,
  moreover, heightens the sense of confinement suggested by the uniforms--if
  indeed that is what the matching dresses are.</P>
  <P>&quot;Grainy and contrasty,&quot; writes John Brumfield, &quot;the photograph
  is a bit on the harsh side, almost scuzzy, with a sour kind of bleakness
  emphasized by the immobility of the figures and the monotony of the building.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#6" TARGET="resource window">6</A>)</FONT> No playful &quot;angelic vision&quot;
  to redeem man here, no body waking and rising to the world in all its &quot;hunks
  and colors,&quot; no acceptance of the &quot;punctual rape of every blessed
  day.&quot; Which is not to say that Frank's photograph is primarily a protest
  image. We see women in the windows of a plain brick building bearing a
  ceremonial flag in honor of the parade referred to in the caption. Period.
  On the other hand, within the context of <I>The Americans</I>, <I>Parade--Hoboken,
  New Jersey</I> becomes a link in a chain, a larger image of an America
  in which the flag, brick wall, dark window, and people aimlessly looking,
  become part of a larger composition that includes countless juke boxes,
  lunch counters, motorcyclists, and large sedans at drive-in movie theatres.
  In Frank's images, people, whether alone, in twos and threes, or in crowds,
  always seeming curiously detached from one another. His people are nothing
  so glamorous as thieves to be reformed or lovers to be undone, and besides,
  the focus is not on their individuality but on their relationships to one
  another as well as to their culture.</P>
  <P>When <I>The Americans</I> was first published, reaction was largely
  hostile, for its images did not conform to the ameliorist vision of the
  postwar to be found in the pages of <I>Life </I>and <I>Look,</I> or, for
  that matter, in <I>The Family of Man</I> exhibition, which opened at the
  Museum of Modern Art in late 1955 and then travelled around the world with
  the subtitle &quot;The greatest photographic exhibition of all time.&quot;
  Carl Sandburg, who provided the Prologue, exclaims:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Everywhere is love and love-making, weddings and babies from generation
    to generation keeping the Family of Man aliving and continuing. Everywhere
    the sun, moon and stars, the climates and weathers, have meanings for people.
    Though meanings vary, we are alike in all countries and tribes in trying
    to read what sky, land and sea say to us. Alike and ever alike we are on
    all continents in the need of love, food, clothing, work, speech, worship,
    sleep, games, dancing, fun. From tropics to arctics humanity lives with
    these needs so alike, so inexorably alike. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#7" TARGET="resource window">7</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>So a photograph of lovers in Italy is juxtaposed to a &quot;comparable&quot;
  one from New Guinea (see figures 2 and 3), nude pregnant women roaming
  the rocky steppes of Kordofan (figure 4) are juxtaposed to a blonde pregnant
  American woman, cosily nestled under a blanket contemplating the pussy
  cat at her feet (figure 5), and so on. Everywhere, it seems, love calls
  us to the things of this world. </P>
  <P>&quot;Poems,&quot; Richard Wilbur remarked in an interview, &quot;are
  not addressed to anybody in particular.&quot; The poem . . . is a conflict
  with disorder, not a message from one person to another.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#8" TARGET="resource window">8</A>)</FONT>The poem as &quot;message from one person to another&quot;:
  Frank O'Hara, we shall see, adopted precisely this Wilburian negative,
  or rather, he had already adopted it before Wilbur made this pronouncement.
  I shall come back to this point but, for the moment, let's backtrack and
  try to understand this &quot;conflict with disorder,&quot; this containment
  of chaos, or, as Reuben Brower called it in <I>The Fields of Light</I>,
  &quot;the aura around a bright clear centre.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#9" TARGET="resource window">9</A>)</FONT> Robert Frank, an emigre from Switzerland (the one neutral
  country during the war), who came to the U.S. in 1947 at the age of twenty-three,
  to experience, at first hand, the fabled American freedom, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#10" TARGET="resource window">10</A>)</FONT> had nothing at all to say about bright clear
  centers. But the dominant discourse of the period, whether in photography
  or poetry, was both centered and centrist, even when, as in the case of
  Robert Lowell, it was much darker than Richard Wilbur's genial one. The
  &quot;skunk hour&quot; of Lowell's famous poem, for example, is defined
  by its allusive relationship to St. John of the Cross's Dark Night of the
  Soul, and centered by the sign of the &quot;chalk-dry and spar spire /
  of the Trinitarian Church&quot; that dominates Lowell's Maine village--the
  emblem, for the poet, of a residual and dessicated Puritanism that could
  only poison human lives.</P>
  <P>In &quot;Memories of West Street and Lepke,&quot; which appears just
  a few pages before &quot;Skunk Hour&quot; in <I>Life Studies</I> (1959),
  Lowell refers to the decade as the &quot;tranquillized fifties.&quot; The
  reference is specifically to Miltown, the first of the popular tranquillizers
  (&quot;Tamed by Miltown, we lie on mother's bed&quot; is the opening line
  of &quot;Man and Wife&quot;), but of course it points more generally at
  the supposed political apathy and complacency of the affluent fifties.
  Yet the adjective &quot;tranquillized&quot; gives us little sense of the
  actual faultlines of the period -- faultlines visible when we read Robert
  Frank's <I>The Americans</I> against <I>The Family of Man</I> and, as we
  shall see below, when we read the more radical poets of the fifties against
  a poet like Wilbur. First, though, I want to sketch in the tensions in
  question.<BR>
  </P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#1E20FB">Culture Shocks</FONT></B></P>
  <P>The lead story of the January 23, 1956 issue of <I>Newsweek</I> was
  called &quot;The Eisenhower Era.&quot; Although the President had not yet
  made up his mind to run again (that didn't happen until March), and although
  the public worried that Ike's failing health would put Nixon, who was generally
  disliked and mistrusted, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#11" TARGET="resource window">11</A>)</FONT> just
  &quot;a heartbeat away from the presidency,&quot; Eisenhower was enormously
  popular. Polls gave his performance a 75% approval rating, and no wonder:
  as <I>Newsweek</I> records, jobs were up from 61.3 to 65 million, taxes
  were cut although inflation was down, and 57% of Americans owned their
  own homes as compared to 55% in 1952. The country was at peace--ten years
  after the end of World War II, three years after the end of the Korean
  War, and a decade before there was full-fledged war in Vietnam, Americans
  were not fighting anywhere on the globe. And even McCarthyism was losing
  its force: the Senator, curtailed by the Senate's condemnation motion of
  December 1954, was to die within the year.</P>
  <P>In his Introduction to <I>Colliers</I>'s new series on &quot;The American
  Tradition,&quot; Henry Steele Commager asked, &quot;What has America meant
  to mankind?&quot; and he replied:</P>
  <P>It has meant a chance to prove that men could govern themselves, and
  to show that a vast continent with the greatest diversity of interest and
  mixture of peoples could nevertheless hold together as a single nation.
  It has meant an example to the whole world of expansion without imperialism
  and power without militarism. And it has meant freedom--freedom from tyrannical
  government, freedom from economic oppression, freedom from ignorance and
  superstition. </P>
  <P>These are all part of the American tradition, and so, too, those less
  dramatic and quieter things--the land itself, so spacious and various and
  beautiful, the struggle with the frontier carried on from generation to
  generation; the spread of plenty and well- being over a large area; the
  widest experiment in public education in all history, schoolhouses in every
  village and town, and colleges and universities in every state of the land;
  the elevation of the status and dignity of woman; philanthropy on a scale
  never before practiced; the spread of libraries and museums and orchestras
  and the quickening of pride in the commonwealth. All this, too, is part
  of the American tradition. (27 April 1956, p. 21)</P>
  <P>From the hindsight of 1996, we tend to read these optimistic and patriotic
  declarations of '56 with great skepticism. But it's important to remember
  that there was a grain of truth in Commager's article: the creation of
  new universities, orchestras, libraries, and cultural centers <I>was</I>
  astonishing as was the affluence that made it possible for, say, the young
  Allen Ginsberg, arriving in San Francisco in 1954 with only $20 in his
  pocket, to land &quot;almost immediately&quot; a market research position
  with Towne-Oller Associates, an elegant firm on Montgomery Street. He had
  a secretary and was making up to $450 a month. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#12" TARGET="resource window">12</A>)</FONT> And when, a few months later, Ginsberg told his psychiatrist
  that what he really wanted to do was to stop work, write poetry, spend
  days out of doors, visit museums and friends, and cultivate his own perceptions
  and visions, Dr. Hicks replied, &quot;Well, why don't you?&quot; A challenge
  that Ginsberg quickly accepted, managing (on what?) to produce the poems
  to be collected in <I>Howl</I> (1956). <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#13" TARGET="resource window">13</A>)</FONT>
  On the other coast, meanwhile, Frank O'Hara, living with a succession of
  friends and lovers in a succession of wonderfully cheap apartments (c.
  $60 a month), was able to find work at the ticket booth or card shop of
  the Museum of Modern Art so as to support his poetic habit. But then of
  course O'Hara and Ginsberg were hardly members of the working class. They
  were Ivy Leaguers (Harvard and Columbia respectively), and in the mid-fifties
  Ivy Leaguers could always get by somehow. </P>
  <P>Indeed, the affluence of the Eisenhower years was nowhere more visible
  than in the booming university culture (thanks to the GI Bill) and arts
  establishment. It was a time of ardent Francophilia: on Broadway, Julie
  Harris was starring in <I>The Lark</I>, Jean Anouilh's sentimental psychodrama
  about Joan of Arc, and Giraudoux's version of the Trojan War, <I>La Guerre
  de Troie n'aura pas lieu</I> was a big hit in Christopher Fry's verse translation,
  <I>Tiger at the Gates</I>. The Comedie Fran&ccedil;aise on tour presented
  Moli&egrave;re's <I>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</I> and Marivaux's <I>Arlequin
  poli par l'amour</I>. Simon and Schuster brought out an English translation
  of Proust's <I>Jean </I>Santeuil (reviewed in <I>The Nation</I> by Mina
  Curtis), Vintage published Montaigne's autobiography, Baudelaire's art
  criticism (under the title <I>The </I>Mirror of Art), Bergson's <I>Comedy</I>,
  Gide's <I>Strait is the Gate</I> and his <I>Journals</I>, and Camus's <I>The
  Rebel.</I> And Harcourt Brace published a new translation of Moli&egrave;re's
  <I>Le Misanthrope</I> by none other than Richard Wilbur.</P>
  <P>It was still a time, then, when mainstream publishers brought out &quot;serious&quot;
  literary works, preferably French or at least foreign (but rarely, in this
  early postwar period, German). And not only literary: Doubleday, today
  a largely commercial house, published a new translation of Diderot's <I>Rameu's
  Nephew</I>, Ortega y Gasset's <I>Dehumanization of Art</I>, Henri Frankfort's
  <I>Birth of Civilization in the Near East</I>, Arthur Waley's <I>Three
  </I>Ways of Thought in Ancient China, and, what was to be a central work
  for both John Cage and Jackson Mac Low, Suzuki's <I>Zen Buddhism, Selected
  </I>Writing. <BR>
  </P>
  <P>The reader will have noticed by now that, so far as foreign high culture
  is concerned, Writer almost invariably equaled Male, Simone de Beauvoir's
  <I>Mandarins</I>, being a major exception. At the same time--and this is
  an interesting spin on the culture industry--the U.S. novel (as well as
  a fair amount of the poetry, from Leonie Adams, Elizabeth Bishop, and Louise
  Bogan, to Babette Deutsch, Carolyn Kizer, Elizabeth Spencer, and Ruth Stone)
  was largely the domain of women. Katharine Anne Porter's <I>Ship of </I>Fools,
  serialized in the <I>Atlantic</I> in 1956, was one of the major literary
  events of a year that also boasted the publication of Mary McCarthy's <I>A
  Charmed Life</I> and Caroline Gordon's <I>The Malfactors.</I> An important
  story by Flannery O'Connor, &quot;Greenleaf,&quot; appeared in the summer
  issue of the <I>Kenyon Review</I>. And, although I haven't done a count,
  reviewers in the mainstream journals and little magazines were more likely
  to be women in 1956 than in 1996: Bishop, Miles, and Kizer reviewed frequently
  for <I>The New Republic</I>, McCarthy, Vivienne Koch, Mary O. Hivnor, and
  Margaret Avison for the <I>Kenyon Review</I>, Dorothy Van Ghent and Marie
  Boroff for the <I>Yale Review</I>, and so on. Given the large number of
  women among fiction readers, women were allowed--indeed encouraged-- to
  write fiction, but they were almost never editors or publishers, and, with
  such exceptions as Hannah Arendt and Suzanne Langer, not eligible to be
  major &quot;thinkers.&quot; </P>
  <P>No wonder, then, that when a Pittsburgh TV station (WQED), aided by
  special funds from the Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, inaugurated
  a series of monthly programs on intellectuals, it was called &quot;Wise
  Men.&quot; The first Wise Man of the Month was Robert Frost. &quot;Tapping
  the top of a high-toe shoe,&quot; we read in <I>Colliers</I> (27 April),
  &quot;he says poems simple in sound, profound in thought, and amazes his
  audience with the range of his knowledge&quot; (p. 42). In Pittsburgh,
  Frost faced an audience of thousands and he was interviewed by another
  &quot;Wise Man,&quot; Jonah Salk. </P>
  <P>In response to Salk's question about poetic form, Frost made his famous
  declaration, &quot;I'd as soon write free verse as play tennis with the
  net down,&quot; a pronouncement few established poets at the time seemed
  eager to quarrel with. As Wilbur put it, &quot;I have no case whatever
  against controlled free verse. Yet I think it is absurd to feel that free
  verse--which has only been with us in America for a little over a hundred
  years--has definitely 'replaced' measure and rhyme and other traditional
  instruments.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#14" TARGET="resource window">14</A>)</FONT> As for the
  larger function of poetry, Frost declared that &quot;My poems are my adjustment
  to the world,&quot; a revealing statement, for <I>adjustment</I> was one
  of the big watchwords of the psychoanalytic fifties, the drive to be &quot;well-adjusted&quot;
  dominating so much of the personal life of the period. In Freudian parlance,
  moreover, &quot;well-adjusted&quot; was a code-word for &quot;straight&quot;:
  the &quot;well-adjusted&quot; got married, had families, and lived what
  were then called &quot;normal&quot; lives. </P>
  <P>A paradox of this high-culture moment, when funds were as readily available
  for &quot;Wise Men&quot; series as for symphonies and museum exhibitions,
  is that, so far as the Literary Establishment was concerned, the practices
  of the early-century avant-garde--of Futurism, Italian and French, as of
  Dada and Surrealism and Russian Constructivism--might just as well have
  never existed. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#15" TARGET="resource window">15</A>)</FONT> The free verse
  / metrical verse quarrel, for example, doesn't even begin to take account
  of such voco-visual poetic experiments as Kurt Schwitters's <I>Ursonate</I>.
  In the <I>Kenyon</I> and <I>Sewanee</I>, the poet of choice (as Wilbur's
  &quot;Love Calls Us&quot; confirms) was John Donne (see, for example, the
  symposium on &quot;English Verse and What It Sounds Like&quot; in the Fall
  1956 issue of <I>Kenyon Review</I>, where Seymour Chatman and Arnold Stein
  and John Crowe Ransom discuss Donne's prosody), the &quot;great&quot; modern
  poets, Yeats, Frost, and the Eliot of <I>Four Quartets</I> and the verse
  dramas. </P>
  <P>Perhaps &quot;playing tennis with the net down&quot; seemed so dangerous
  because the cultural order, impressively artistic and intellectual as it
  was at one level, could not easily deal with the tensions just beneath
  the surface. In the mid-fifties, the U.S. was the richest and most powerful
  country in the world but also, as one critic puts it, the &quot;most jittery.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#16" TARGET="resource window">16</A>)</FONT> And for good reason. In 1956
  not an issue of <I>Look</I> or <I>Colliers</I> or <I>Newsweek</I> went
  by without some reference to the Cold War. Articles bear names like &quot;Must
  our Air Force be Second Best?&quot; (<I>Look</I>, May 1), &quot;Ex-Stalinists
  of the West,&quot; (a discussion of the response of the various European
  Communist parties to Khrushchev's speech denouncing Stalin, which took
  place in April of '56; see <I>New Republic</I>, April 9), &quot;The Red
  Atom&quot; (<I>Colliers</I>, November 23), &quot;Algeria--can France hold
  on?&quot; (<I>New Republic,</I> April 9), &quot;Communism in South East
  Asia&quot; (<I>Yale Review</I>, Spring 1956), and so on. One of the most
  startling articles, from the perspective of later developments, is Peter
  Kalischer's &quot;Upsetting the Red Timetable,&quot; in the July 6 issue
  of <I>Colliers</I> (p. 29). &quot;Two years ago at Geneva,&quot; writes
  Kalischer, &quot;South Vietnam was virtually sold down the river to the
  Communists. Today the spunky little Asian country is back on its own feet,
  thanks to a 'mandarin in a sharkskin suit,'&quot; who was none other than
  President Ngo Dinh Diem. &quot;Today,&quot; we read, &quot;a republic nine
  months old, South Vietnam is alive, kicking, and pugnaciously anti-Communist.&quot;
  Or so it was hoped, given that, as early as 1956, according to Kalischer,
  53% of all U.S. foreign aid was going to buttress the South Vietnamese
  armed forces.</P>
  <P>But the obsession with the Soviet Union's possible and projected acts
  of aggression, excessive as it may strike us now that the Cold War is over,
  was by no means a figment of the Pentagon's imagination. For by the autumn
  of 1956, just two weeks before Eisenhower was re-elected in a landslide,
  an event took place that marked a significant turning point in Cold War
  politics. That event was the aborted Hungarian Revolution. Fighting broke
  out on October 23 and by the 28th, the Imre Nagy government proclaimed
  a cease-fire, demanded withdrawal of Soviet forces from its capital, reconstituted
  the pre-1947 democratic parties of workers and peasants, and announced
  the abandonment of a one-party regime, withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact,
  neutrality, and free elections. The Soviets hesitated but when the West
  made no move, on November 4, they moved in tanks, brutally crushing the
  rebellion. Almost 200,000 refugees came to the U.S. within the next few
  months. </P>
  <P>The press devoted a good deal of space to the failed revolution as to
  the Poznan workers' riots that took place almost simultaneously in Poland.
  Together with the Suez crisis of July (which signalled the end of British
  imperialism in the Middle East) and the Egypt-Israeli war that broke out
  in October, the year that began with such euphoric commentary on American
  affluence and world peace was ending in a kind of nightmare. No longer
  could the U.S. trust in Kruschchev's &quot;revisionist&quot; intentions.
  Even <I>The Nation</I>, which in the earlier months of 1956 had reported
  enthusiastically about the new Five-Year Plan for consumer goods (Alexander
  Werth, &quot;Russia's Hopes for 1960: Steel, Power and Food,&quot; February
  18), and about the Soviets's good intentions so far as disarmament was
  concerned (Paul Wohl and Alexander Werth, &quot;New Soviet Blueprint: Challenge
  to the West,&quot; March 3), was forced to admit that the Russians were
  not to be trusted. &quot;10 Days that Shook the World: The Counter-Revolution,&quot;
  was the title of Mark Gayn's November 10 piece about events in Eastern
  Europe.</P>
  <P>And further: the difficulties abroad were matched at home by the aftershocks
  of the Desegregation of the Schools Act of 1954. Indeed, although one would
  never know it, in reading, say, <I>The</I> <I>Kenyon Review</I> or even
  the <I>Black Mountain Review</I> (Black Mountain College, incidentally,
  closed in 1956), the race wars were an especially poisonous feature of
  the discourse of these years. Even Adlai Stevenson, the darling of the
  liberals, was not exempt. The Montgomery bus boycott, which began in December
  1955, came to a head in January '56 and brought Martin Luther King to national
  attention. But, as Carey McWilliams points out in an article called &quot;Mr.
  Stevenson on Jim Crow&quot; (<I>Nation,</I> February 18), Stevenson paid
  little attention to the problem. </P>
  <P>In the September 24 issue of <I>The New Republic</I>, L. D. Reddick,
  then a student at Fisk University, reviewed Robert Penn Warren's little
  book, <I>Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South</I>. Warren, who
  was teaching at Vanderbilt, was extremely cautious about integration. It
  shouldn't, he observed, come too soon, for the Negro was not ready for
  it. Such caution was the theme of a <I>Look</I> special feature (3 April),
  evaluating the Desegregation Act. The issue begins by reprinting the famous
  Supreme Court Decision, as expounded by Chief Justice Earl Warren: &quot;'We
  conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of 'separate
  but equal' has no place.&quot; But this view is countered in Senator Sam
  Ervin Jr.'s &quot;The Case for Segregation,&quot; with its current wisdom
  that &quot;people like to socialize with their own&quot; (p. 32). And in
  an ostensibly neutral article called &quot;Fear underlies the Conflict,&quot;
  William Atwood writes: </P>
  <P>Whatever they may tell you, white Southerners are afraid of the Negro
  in their midst. And they are afraid of him today as never before. For the
  Negro no longer behaves like the amiable 'dark' who knew his place and
  did not question the white man's right to give orders.</P>
  <P>The fear is partly political. In the Black Belt, white men shudder at
  the prospect of Negro bloc-voting that might put them under the jurisdiction
  of colored officials. Still haunted by the nightmare of Reconstruction,
  they now feel that any concession to Negro demands for equality means another
  surrender, another Appomattox.</P>
  <P>The fear is also economic. Industrialization has enabled Negroes to
  earn wages that are making them independent of an economic order based
  on discrimination. . . . A negro with money in the bank is no longer at
  the mercy of the dominant race; he becomes a customer to be catered to.</P>
  <P>And the fear is social, with profound sexual undertones. To a white
  Southerner, classroom integration implies a kind of social equality that
  does not exist even on an assembly line. He will tell you that sooner or
  later, some Negro boy will be walking his daughter home from school, staying
  for supper, taking her to the movies . . . and then your Southern friend
  asks you the inevitable, the clinching question, &quot;Would <I>you</I>
  want your daughter to marry a Nigra?&quot;</P>
  <P>And there is nothing you can say to quiet his fears . . . that mixed
  schools will &quot;mongrelize&quot; the race. (p. 27).</P>
  <P>Atwood doesn't say he subscribes to this point of view but neither does
  he condemn it. And again, it may have taken an outsider like Robert Frank
  to show us what everyday life in the South looked like in 1956. (figures
  6 [Funeral--St. Helena, South Carolina], 7 [Charleston, South Carolina],
  8 [Trolley, New Orleans]). In the latter photograph, for example, seven
  people -- up front, a formally dressed white man and, behind him, white
  woman, in the rear, a shirtsleeved black man and casually attired black
  woman, and in the center, two white children, dressed up in what look like
  party clothes, with their all but invisible black nanny hovering behind
  them-- are placed within a tight grid: windows separated by metal strips,
  upper rectangular panels, reflecting only dimly what is going by outside
  the streetcar, and the metal surface below the window, again broken up
  into rectangles, separated by a studded strip. The grid indicates not only
  race but gender separation and hierarchy: in all three cases, the man (or
  little boy) comes first. </P>
  <P>None of the passengers look at one another; rather, all are looking
  out at something--but what? The white man's face is veiled by the reflection
  of the glass because his window is down, the white woman's head is cropped
  as is the black woman's elbow. But whereas the whites sit facing front
  in &quot;normal&quot; position, the children and tbe black man and women
  are turned 90%, facing out of the window, the black woman in back looking
  over her left shoulder. The photograph makes no overt comment on segregation,
  the faces of the blacks at the rear of the car, for instance, show no anger.
  But the image of the jail-like grid is <I>there</I>, startling testimony
  that the Family of Man, the entity that Sandburg called &quot;one big family
  hugging close to the ball of Earth for its life and being,&quot; is more
  accurately an aggregate of wholly separate beings placed together in a
  series of arbitrarily defined spaces that have been assigned to them. &quot;Robert,&quot;
  said Allen Ginsberg in a 1985 piece on Frank's work, &quot;had invented
  a new way of lonely solitary chance conscious seeing, in the little Leica
  format. . . . Spontaneous glance--accident truth.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A

  </FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#3125FF">Counterpoetics</FONT></B></P>
  <P>&quot;Lonely solitary chance conscious seeing&quot;: Ginsberg might
  have been talking about his own poetry or, for that matter, of the &quot;New
  American Poetry&quot; as it manifested itself in 1956, the year of <I>Howl</I>,
  as well as of some of Frank O'Hara's most important &quot;lunch poems,&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#18" TARGET="resource window">18</A>)</FONT> and of John Ashbery's <I>Some
  Trees</I>, which won the Yale Younger Poets Prize for 1956. The usual view
  is that Ginsberg was a &quot;public&quot; poet, O'Hara and Ashbery much
  more private and &quot;apolitical&quot; ones, but it would be more accurate
  to say that in the work of all three (and this is also true for their intersecting
  but different circles), the political is internalized in very curious and
  complicated ways. Complicated in that, unlike their avant-garde precursors
  of the early century (Mayakovsky, an important model both for Ginsberg
  and for O'Hara, is a case in point), fifties poets, however radical or
  counterculture they took themselves to be, seem to have had no meaningful
  access to a public sphere that operated according to increasingly incomprehensible
  laws. </P>
  <P>A terrifying and ideologically charged war had just been &quot;won,&quot;
  but before the lessons of that war and the Holocaust could in any way be
  assimilated, much less digested, our former allies, the Soviets, were shown
  to have committed genocide that rivalled Hitler's--genocide, moreover,
  against their own people, beginning with the destruction of the peasantry
  in the course of the collectivization of the farms and culminating in the
  Gulag. The cycle of totalitarianism and death seemed to be starting all
  over again, this time with the new threat of nuclear weapons. At the same
  time, the Cold War was just that--cold--which is to say a very distant
  reality to those who actually lived their everyday life in the New York
  or San Francisco of the later fifties. If you were a male white poet, even
  a gay male white poet in 1956, the reality of everyday life was the reality
  of possibility. New ballets to see and great Italian movies to go to, new
  gay bars in the Village or in North Beach, new art galleries showing breakthrough
  painting and performances of John Cage's &quot;Music of Changes.&quot;
  At the same time, for Ginsberg, as for O'Hara and Ashbery, possibility
  was consistently threatened by the awareness that there were jobs they,
  as gay men, could not hold, places they were not wanted, and that the bars
  they frequented were regularly raided.</P>
  <P>Diagnosis and critique, thirties-style, were out of the question, there
  being no specific &quot;them&quot; to blame for international conditions
  and no commitment, as yet, to focus on the plight of minorities at home.
  Better not to think about politics at all and to concentrate, as fifties
  poetry did with a vengeance, on personal fulfillment. Even Ginsberg's &quot;angelheaded
  hipsters,&quot; after all, were those who, in the words of &quot;Howl,&quot;
  &quot;drag[ged] themselves through the negro streets&quot; (notably not
  <I>their</I> streets but the streets of Harlem) &quot;looking for an angry
  fix,&quot; or &quot;drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if
  I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#19" TARGET="resource window">19</A>)</FONT> En route to vision, there was
  a good deal of contradiction, as in Ginsberg's marvelously comic, marvellously
  painful ode of 1956 called &quot;America.&quot; It begins:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>America I've given you all and now I'm nothing.</P>
    <P>America two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956.</P>
    <P>I can't stand my own mind.</P>
    <P>America when will we end the human war?</P>
    <P>Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb.</P>
    <P>I don't feel good don't bother me. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#20" TARGET="resource window">20</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Warren Tallmann rightly called &quot;America&quot; &quot;the nearest
  thing to a purely clown poem Ginsberg has.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#21" TARGET="resource window">21</A>) </FONT>It's not that the poet isn't genuinely worried about
  the atomic bomb and the Cold War, but the relationship between public and
  private has become so fractured that the strongest urge is to opt out.
  &quot;I don't feel good don't bother me&quot; is a candid admission that
  he, at any rate, doesn't want to participate--not in war (Ginsberg was
  not drafted because of his near-sightedness), but not in oppositional activity
  either. The only way to respond, it seems, is to play the fool:</P>
  <P>When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good
  looks?</P>
  <P>America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.</P>
  <P>Your machinery is too much for me.</P>
  <P>You made me want to be a saint.</P>
  <P>There must be some other way to settle this argument. (AGCP 146)</P>
  <P>But what is rarely remarked is that the droll self-deprecation we find
  in &quot;America&quot; is itself a function of affluence. Consider the
  following lines:</P>
  <P>I smoke marijuana every chance I get.</P>
  <P>I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.
  . . . </P>
  <P>My psychoanalyst thinks I'm perfectly right.</P>
  <P>I won't say the Lord's Prayer</P>
  <P>I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations</P>
  <P>America I still haven't told you what you did to Uncle Max after he
  came over from Russia.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>I'm addressing you.</P>
  <P>Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?</P>
  <P>I'm obsessed by Time Magazine.</P>
  <P>I read it every week.</P>
  <P>Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.</P>
  <P>I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library.</P>
  <P>It's always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious.</P>
  <P>Movie producers are serious. Everybody's serious but me.</P>
  <P>It occurs to me that I am America,</P>
  <P>I am talking to myself again.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>Asia is rising against me.</P>
  <P>I haven't got a chinaman's chance.</P>
  <P>I'd better consider my national resources.</P>
  <P>My national resources consist of two joints ot marijuana millions of
  genitals</P>
  <P>an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes 1400 miles an hour</P>
  <P>and twenty-five-thousand mental institutions.</P>
  <P>I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who
  live</P>
  <P>in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns.</P>
  <P>I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to
  go.</P>
  <P>My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I'm a Catholic.
  (146-47)</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>The latter part of this passage acts as an index to the U.S. &quot;concerns&quot;
  of the day, as reported in the newspapers-- the U.S. obsession with Communist
  China, the flaunting of &quot;national resources,&quot; the burgeoning
  prison and mental-hospital population (Ginsberg knew the latter at first
  hand), and the public indifference to the underprivileged &quot;liv[ing]
  in my flowerpots&quot; (a foreshadowing of the homelessness to come two
  decades later). And Ginsberg is wonderfully deft at weaving together the
  clich&eacute;s of press talk (&quot;Asia is rising against [us]&quot;)
  with ordinary racist clich&eacute; (&quot;I haven't got a chinaman's chance&quot;),
  memories of personal oppression, as in the reference to Uncle Max, jokes
  about middle-class morality (&quot;I have abolished the whorehouses of
  France, Tangiers is the next to go&quot;--this latter, a reference to William
  Burroughs, who went there for the sake of the drug culture), and finally
  with the common wisdom of the day (<I>pace</I> then Senator John F. Kennedy)
  that a Catholic could not be elected president in the Protestant U.S.<BR>
  But it is also the case that Ginsberg's absurdist &quot;holy litany&quot;
  is predicated on the availability of possessions undreamt of by the citizens
  of other nations in 1956-- plenty of free time, liquor, marijuana, the
  public library, and money to pay the psychoanalyst-- so that the &quot;national
  resources&quot; he lampoons so brilliantly are also ones he takes for granted.
  Again, the catalogue &quot;America free Tom Mooney / America save the Spanish
  Loyalists / America Sacco &amp; Vanzetti must not die / America I am the
  Scottboro boys&quot; and the spoof on anti-Communist paranoia in Ginsberg's
  &quot;cigar-store Cherokee&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A

  parody dialect--&quot;The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia's power
  mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages. . . . Him big bureaucracy
  running our fillingstations&quot; (H 33)-- is undercut by the campy conclusion:</P>
  <P>America is this correct?</P>
  <P>I'd better get right down to the job.</P>
  <P>It's true I don't want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision
  parts factories, I'm nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.</P>
  <P>America I'm putting my queer shoulder to the wheel.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>Here is a twist to &quot;Love Calls Us to the Things of this World&quot;
  that Richard Wilbur didn't have in mind. Ginsberg's candor and colloquialism,
  his pointed imagery (so different from Wilbur's elegant metaphysical conceits),
  his defiantly anti-poetic, non-scannable chant-like verse, his willingness
  to let it all hang out, his refusal to play the game, his admission of
  weakness--these were surely a breath of fresh air in the poetic world of
  1956. Indeed, the stunning conclusion, with its allusion to Whitman's equally
  queer if more decorous apostrophes to America, remains a watershed in postwar
  American poetry.</P>
  <P>Yet--and this is a signature of the time -- no matter how &quot;oppositional&quot;
  Ginsberg's stance purports to be, its disengagement (drop out, get high,
  have sex) may leave us feeling slightly queasy. Unlike its models--Whitman's
  &quot;Song of Myself&quot; and &quot;I Hear America Singing,&quot; Blaise
  Cendrars's &quot;Easter in New York,&quot; &quot;Apollinaire's &quot;Zone,&quot;
  Mayakovsky's &quot;Cloud in Trousers&quot;--poems where personal vision
  goes hand in hand with serious social critique --here putting one's &quot;queer
  shoulder to the wheel&quot; is not likely to lead to anything. &quot;I'm
  in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.&quot;
  Is it a wise passiveness? Or just, in the words of Ginsberg's first book
  title, an &quot;empty mirror&quot;?</P>
  <P>A somewhat different spin occurs in a related poem of 1956, </P>
  <P>Frank O'Hara's &quot;A Step Away from Them.&quot;:</P>

  In this famous &quot;lunch poem,&quot; public events obviously play much
  less of a role than in Ginsberg's &quot;America.&quot; Indeed, its oppositionality
  would seem to be all on the level of rhetoric. For Wilbur's highly crafted
  stanzas, O'Hara substitutes a nervous short free-verse line, breaks coming
  at the least expected junctures and creating a taut suspension, as in the
  very first lines, &quot;It's my lunch hour, so I go / for a walk among
  the hum-colored / cabs.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#24" TARGET="resource window">24</A>)</FONT>
  Again, for Wilbur's studied impersonality, O'Hara substitutes the intimate
  address, whether to a friend or to himself, he describes in &quot;Personism,&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#25" TARGET="resource window">25</A>) </FONT>and for Wilbur's elaborately
  contrived metaphor (as in the case of the &quot;angelic&quot; bed-sheets,
  &quot;rising together in calm swells / Of halcyon feeling, filling whatever
  they wear / With the deep joy of their impersonal breathing&quot;), O'Hara's
  &quot;I&quot; substitutes persons, places, and objects that are palpable,
  real, and closely observed. </P>
  <P>The poet's lunch-hour walk, presumably from the Museum of Modern Art
  on 53d St. between 5th and 6th Avenue in the direction of Times Square,
  is full of enticing sights and sounds: cabs hum, laborers in hard hats
  (whose &quot;dirty / glistening torsos&quot; the gay poet subliminally
  desires) are eating sandwiches and drinking Coca-Cola, the skirts of girls
  in high heels (the then proverbial office uniform) &quot;flip&quot; and
  &quot;blow up over / grates,&quot; the myriad cut-rate jewelry shops on
  6th Avenue try to outdo each other with &quot;bargains in wristwatches,&quot;
  the huge Chestfield ad above Times Square blows smoke at the cigarette-friendly
  pedestrian, a black man, hanging out in a doorway makes eyes at a blonde
  chorus girl walking by, and the Puerto Ricans on the Avenue are enough
  to make it, by the poet's Dadaesque reasoning, &quot;beautiful and warm.&quot;
  Pleasurable, too, are the absurd contradictions representative of New York
  life: the &quot;Negro . . . with a toothpick, langurously agitating,&quot;
  the &quot;Neon in daylight&quot; and &quot;lightbulbs in daylight,&quot;
  the lunchspots with fancy names like JULIET'S CORNER that serve cheeseburgers
  and chocolate malteds, the ladies with poodles who wear fox furs even on
  the hottest summer day,, and so on.</P>
  <P>But, as James E. B. Breslin noted in his excellent essay on O'Hara (JEB
  210-49), the poet seems to be &quot;a step away,&quot; not only from the
  dead friends (Bunny Lang, John Latouche, Jackson Pollock) he will memorialize
  later in the poem, but from all the persons and objects in his field of
  vision &quot;Sensations,&quot; writes Breslin, &quot;disappear almost as
  soon as they are presented. Objects and people . . . remain alien to a
  poet who can never fully possess them&quot;(JEB 218). The question is why.
  For Breslin, the poet's malaise, his inability to hold on to things, to
  move toward any kind of transcendence beyond the fleeting, evanescent moment
  is largely a function of O'Hara's unique psychological make-up. But since,
  as Breslin himself suggests, O'Hara's fabled &quot;openness is an admitted
  act of contrivance and duplicity&quot; (JEB 231), we might consider the
  role culture plays in its formation.</P>
  <P>Consider, to begin with, the repeated metonymic displacements of specific
  metaphors. New York's yellow cabs are compared to bees (&quot;hum-colored&quot;),
  but their color relates them to the laborers' &quot;yellow helmets,&quot;
  worn to &quot;protect them from falling / bricks, I guess.&quot; Yellow
  helmets, yellow jackets: the poem's brilliance is to connect these disparate
  items and yet to leave the import of the connection hanging. Is the tentative
  explanation (&quot;I guess&quot;) about &quot;falling bricks&quot; tongue-in-cheek
  or serious? In the same vein, &quot;skirts&quot; are no sooner seen &quot;flipping
  / above heels&quot; in the hot air than they are described as &quot;blow[ing]
  up over/ grates,&quot; even as the sign high up in Times Square &quot;blows
  smoke over my head.&quot; &quot;Blow,&quot; for O'Hara, always has sexual
  connotations, but &quot;blow up,&quot; soon to be the title of Antonioni's
  great film, also points to the vocabulary of nuclear crisis omnipresent
  in the public discourse of these years. And now the muted and intermittent
  sounds of skirts flipping, smoke blowing, cabs stirring up the air, and
  cats playing in the sawdust give way to the moment when &quot;Everything
  / suddenly honks: it is 12.40 of / a Thursday.&quot; Here sound is illogically
  related to time: gridlock in the streets, an absolutely ordinary event
  in midtown Manhattan, somehow makes the poet look up at the big clock above
  Times Square and have the surreal sense that time iscoming to a stop. The
  connection is momentary (rather like an air-raid siren going off), but
  it changes the pedestrian's mood. At 12:40, at any rate, lunch hour has
  passed the half-way point, and now thoughts of the dead come to the fore--or
  were they already there in the reference to the &quot;sawdust&quot; in
  which the cats play? The pronoun &quot;I&quot; shifts to the impersonal
  &quot;one&quot;; &quot;neon in daylight&quot; is no longer such a pleasure,
  revealing as it does the &quot;magazines with nudes / and the posters for
  BULLFIGHT,&quot; and the mortuary-like &quot;Manhattan Storage Warehouse
  / which they'll soon tear down,&quot; the reference to the Armory in the
  next line linking death with war.</P>
  <P>By this time, the &quot;great pleasure&quot; of the poet's lunch hour
  has been occluded by anxiety. Not the fear of anything in particular: O'Hara's
  New York is still a long way from the crime and drug-ridden Manhattan of
  the nineties. On the contrary, the poet's anxiety seems to stem from the
  sheer glut of sensation: so many new and colorful things to see-- new movies
  starring Giuletta Massina, new Ballachine ballets for Edwin Denby to write
  about, new editions of Reverdy poems, new buildings going up all over town.
  Colorful, moreover, is now associated with persons of color: the poet,
  exoticizing the Other, takes pleasure in the &quot;click&quot; between
  the &quot;langurously agitating Negro&quot; and &quot;blonde chorus girl&quot;
  (a sly parody of the scare question being asked with regularity in the
  wake of the Desegregation Act of 1954, &quot;Would you want your daughter
  to marry a Nigra?&quot;) <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#26" TARGET="resource window">26</A>)</FONT> ,
  and he observes playfully that &quot;There are several Puerto Ricans on
  the avenue today, which / makes it beautiful and warm.&quot; Yet--and here
  the contrast replicates the juxtapositions found in <I>Look</I> or <I>Colliers</I>--
  for every exotic sight and delightful sensation, there are falling bricks,
  bullfights, blow ups and blow outs, armories, mortuaries, and, as the name
  Juliet's Corner suggests, tombs. In this context, ironically, the actual
  death references in the poem (&quot;First / Bunny died . . .&quot;) function
  almost as overkill.</P>
  <P>The &quot;glass of papaya juice &quot; of the penultimate lines sums
  it up nicely. Papaya, now sold in every large city supermarket, was a new
  commodity in the fifties; the new Puerto Rican emigres (who, for Frank,
  make it &quot;beautiful and warm&quot;) were opening juice bars all over
  Manhattan. Papaya juice was considered not only exotic but healthful, the
  idea of drinking fruit and vegetable drinks that are good for you being
  itself a novelty in this period. The juice bar O'Hara frequents on the
  way &quot;back to work&quot; makes a wonderful contrast to the hamburger
  joint where he had lunch. Cheeseburger &amp; malted: this all-American
  meal, soon to be marketed around the globe by McDonald's, gives way to
  the glass of papaya juice--a new &quot;foreign&quot; import. But the juice
  the poet ingests is also contrasted to the heart which is in &quot;my pocket&quot;
  and which is &quot;Poems by Pierre Reverdy.&quot; The heart is not in the
  body where it belongs but worn externally, in the poet's pocket. And again
  it is a foreign (in this case, French) vintage.</P>
  <P>In the boom economy of the late fifties, such new foreign imports created
  a daydream world of exotic pleasures. But the yellow helmets (also reminiscent
  of air raid helmets) and falling bricks, the sudden honking, the large-scale
  razing of buildings, and the Bullfight poster remind us, as they remind
  the poet, that the delights proffered by the culture are not only transient,
  as Breslin suggests, but that there may well be nothing <I>behind</I> the
  &quot;neon in daylight&quot; surfaces. Which--and this is the poet's as
  well as the reader's quandary --doesn't make them any less desirable. On
  the contrary, whereas Wilbur's &quot;Love Calls Us,&quot; argues that we
  must accept the fallen world with love and compassion, &quot;A Step Away
  from Them&quot; asserts that, yes, of course, our fallen world (fallen
  from what?) of &quot;dirty glistening torsos&quot; is lovable (whether
  it &quot;deserves&quot; our love is a question O'Hara would never presume
  to answer!), but wonders how the hell we can survive those artificial waterfalls
  and falling bricks. To which the answer, in the words of the neighboring
  &quot;Song [Is it Dirty?]&quot; is &quot;you don't refuse to breathe do
  you&quot; (FOH 327). </P>
  <P>Thus the personal becomes the political. O'Hara's close friend John
  Ashbery, who was, in these same years, translating Reverdy, internalized
  the &quot;march of events&quot; even more fully. His response was to produce
  fragmented narrative in which the hackneyed discourse of the popular press,
  patriotic sloganeering, literary and film allusions, and highly private
  references were woven together in a seemingly seamless whole, the poet
  shifting roles so rapidly that it was impossible to identify his voice
  in the poem. When it first appeared in 1956 in an edition of 817 copies,
  Ashbery's second book, <I>Some Trees</I> (Yale University Press) was a
  hopeless anomaly, despite its prize-winning status. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#27" TARGET="resource window">27</A>)</FONT> The poet himself was not available to defend
  it; he had left the U.S. for Paris in '55, not to return for a decade.
  In a 1988 interview with O'Hara's biographer Brad Gooch, Ashbery sketches
  in the background for this decade abroad:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>I couldn't write anything from about the summer of 1950 to the end of
    1951. It was a terribly depressing period both in the world and in my life.
    I had no income or prospects. The Korean War was on and I was afraid I
    might be drafted. There were anti- homosexual campaigns. I was called up
    for the draft and I pleaded that as a reason not to be drafted. Of course
    this was recorded and I was afraid that we'd all be sent to concentration
    camps if McCarthy had his own way. It was a very dangerous and scary period.&quot;

  <P>But the reality of 1956 was more complicated than this later rationalization
  would suggest. The &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;scariness&quot; does enter
  the poetry, but its mediations are multiple. Here is &quot;Two Scenes,&quot;
  the opening poem of <I>Some Trees</I>:</P>

  <P></P>
  <P>Ironically enough, this particular poem was first published in <I>The
  Kenyon Review </I>(Spring 1956), where it was wedged between two quite
  conventional poems, Herbert Morris's &quot;Twenty-Eight&quot; and Theodore
  Holmes's &quot;The Life of the Estate,&quot; the latter containing such
  passages as &quot;The house sits up on the hill; and has that satisfied
  look / Of a head taking credit for the comfort the body enjoys in bed.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="1956_footnotes.html#30" TARGET="resource window">30</A>)</FONT> Given its title and its &quot;normal&quot;
  stanzaic appearance (&quot;Two Scenes&quot; has two nine line stanzas,
  its lines ranging from six to fifteen syllables), the <I>Kenyon</I> readership
  might have glanced at it and concluded that it was just another pictorial
  poem, with pastoral references to &quot;tips of mountains&quot; and &quot;a
  fine rain.&quot; Those who did actually read it, however, must have been
  more than a little confused.</P>
  <P>&quot;We see us,&quot; the poem opens, &quot;as we truly behave.&quot;
  Not as the familiar adage has it, &quot;We see ourselves as others see
  us,&quot; and certainly not &quot;We see ourselves as we truly <I>are</I>,&quot;
  but, inconsequentially (for how could it be otherwise, given that the other's
  behavior is the one thing we certainly can &quot;see&quot;), &quot;as we
  truly behave.&quot; The assertive opening statement is thus no more than
  tautology, and hence empty gesture, even as the lines that follow convey
  perfectly reasonable information that doesn't add up because there is no
  context that relates &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b.&quot; &quot;From every corner
  comes a distinctive offering&quot;: a simple enough sentence and suggestive
  of formal ceremony: the journey of the Magi or homage to the Queen on her
  birthday, perhaps. &quot;The train comes bearing joy&quot; is equally reasonable,
  but how do &quot;The sparks it (the train?) strikes illuminate the table&quot;?
  What table? And in line 4 the expected train conductor or engineer turns
  out to be a water-pilot; perhaps, then, the table of line 3 was a water
  table. The ominously repeated reference to &quot;destiny&quot; defies explanation,
  at least at this point in the poem, but clearly the arrival of the boat
  (which has now replaced the train) is significant: &quot;For long we hadn't
  heard so much news, such noise.&quot; Line 7 in contrast, is straightforward
  description: &quot;The day was warm and pleasant&quot; sounds like the
  opening of any standard short story in a highschool textbook. But again
  the statement is undercut: the familiar pop song line &quot;I see you in
  my dreams&quot; becomes the absurd &quot;We see you in your hair,&quot;
  &quot;hair&quot; now rhyming with the &quot;Air&quot; that opens the next
  line, a line that recalls a Chinese or Japanese brush painting where air
  seems to rest &quot;around the tips of mountains.&quot; This last statement
  is in quotations, but who says it? </P>
  <P>What, then, is the poem all about? In II, which by no means follows
  I, the first five lines (the first three are rough hexameters) rhyme on
  unstressed suffixes of abstract nouns: &quot;machinery,&quot; &quot;honesty,&quot;
  &quot;history,&quot; &quot;authority,&quot; &quot;poverty.&quot; The verse
  lumbers on dully, rather like badly written skeltonics. Yet this stanza
  does refer back to Scene I. The fine rain anointing the canal machinery
  takes us back to the movements of the water-pilot; perhaps he is steering
  his ship down the canal. The destiny that guides the pilot is real enough,
  since &quot;This is perhaps a day of general honesty / Without example
  in the world's history / Though the fumes are not of a singular authority
  / And indeed as dry as poverty.&quot; A mock-announcement is about to be
  made but it never occurs. Rather, the poet's camera zeros in on &quot;an
  old man / In the blue shadow of some paint cans.&quot; Picasso (and Stevens's)
  &quot;man with the blue guitar&quot;? Or just an old housepainter? We can
  never be sure: &quot;As laughing cadets say, 'In the evening / Everything
  has a schedule, if you can find out what it is.&quot;</P>
  <P>The last line with its Wittgensteinian twist might serve as an epigraph
  for any number of Ashbery poems and, for that matter, for the language
  poems that are their successors. On the one hand, procedure is all--everything
  has a schedule, a formula, an instruction manual. On the other, you can
  never &quot;find out what it is.&quot; Its meaning eludes us. But the &quot;if&quot;
  ensures that we keep on looking. And indeed, &quot;Two Scenes&quot; is
  not at all non-referential. When we reread it, we note that it foregrounds
  the basic need to decipher what one sees--to catch that &quot;distinctive
  offering&quot; coming to us &quot;from every corner.&quot; And the ciphers
  are indeed tantalizing, the train, the sparks that illuminate the table,
  the water-pilot making his way through the canal in a fine rain, the canal
  fumes, the blue shadow of the paint cans, the laughing cadets. Is this
  a journey up river in a Conrad novel? Are we witnessing a love scene (&quot;We
  see you in your hair&quot;)? Or a film account of mobilization, the laughing
  cadets waving goodbye to those of us who remain behind? </P>
  <P>One way to approach these questions it to read the poem as a cultural
  as well as a lyrical text. The mid-fifties, as we have seen in Henry Steele
  Commager's paean to America, was a time bloated with patriotic and nationalist
  slogans. &quot;Destiny guides the water-pilot and it is destiny,&quot;
  surely echoes Roosevelt's ringing &quot;I have a rendezvous with destiny&quot;
  as well as the Hollywood film <I>God is my Co-Pilot</I>. &quot;This is
  perhaps a day . . . without example in the world's history&quot; recalls
  the President's reference to December 7 (Pearl Harbor) as a day that shall
  live in infamy, even as &quot;general amnesty&quot; punningly and absurdly
  reappears as &quot;general honesty.&quot; At the same time, Ashbery's &quot;story-line&quot;
  alludes to the drive toward epiphany so characteristic of <I>Kenyon Review</I>
  short stories (&quot;The sparks it strikes illuminate the table&quot;),
  as well as to the master narrative of the period which was relentlessly
  Freudian, authoritatively guiding those ways in which &quot;we truly behave,&quot;
  even as the movies increasingly guided the ways in which we looked. There
  is not an image in Ashbery's poem that we haven't seen somewhere else (think
  of all the fifties movies where a train chuffs into town, purportedly bringing
  &quot;joy&quot;), not an image that hasn't been recycled from another unnamed
  source. And the laughing cadets serve as a reminder of military operations,
  of the boy soldiers about to given a schedule, but for what? It seems that
  even here war is not so far away.</P>
  <P>Ashbery's lines are ungainly, his language like &quot;Terrific units&quot;
  designedly anti-poetic. Allusion, used pointedly and sparingly in poems
  of the Wilbur tradition, is now the very fabric of the poem--everything
  alludes to something, if you can find out what it is. Note that unlike
  Wilbur, Ashbery makes no claim to know &quot;the things of the world&quot;;
  indeed, things have become so much &quot;canal machinery,&quot; as equivocal
  as Robert Frank's quite literal but ultimately opaque images. Unlike the
  Ginsberg of <I>Howl</I> or the O'Hara of <I>Lunch Poems,</I> Ashbery does
  not place himself at the center of the poem. &quot;I&quot; becomes &quot;we&quot;
  becomes &quot;you.&quot; The subjectivity of the poet is thus everywhere
  and nowhere, which is another way of saying it is inextricable from the
  poetic language itself. Perhaps, in the wake of &quot;Wise Man of the Month&quot;
  discourse, this was the most adequate way of coming to terms with a public
  sphere as baffling as it was impenetrable.</P>
  <P>Ashbery's lyric mode in this, the very first of the texts in his <I>Selected
  Poems</I> (a mode, incidentally, that has not changed significantly over
  the years) has enormous implications for the poetry of our own time, although
  it is only fair to say that in the nineties, as in the fifties, the dominant
  poetic paradigm is not unlike the Wilbur model (or module), with its drive
  toward profundity, its desire to &quot;say something&quot; about body and
  soul, love and war. The later fifties mark, in this respect, an important
  turning point. In 1956, we might say, public spectacle, especially as filtered
  through the media, had become at once so threatening and yet so remote
  that the easiest poetic (or artistic) path was to pretend none of the negative
  symptoms existed. Didn't <I>The Family of Man</I> prove that love, childbirth,
  illness, and death were the same the world over? And weren't those elaborate
  conceits treasured by mainstream poets timeless and universal? </P>
  <P>In this context, counterculture poetics could only respond with what
  was quite literally an opening, but no more than an opening, of the field.
  Questions of politics were neither dramatized as, say, in Yeats's great
  &quot;Easter 1916,&quot; which was, after all, an insider's view of the
  &quot;Irish Question,&quot; nor used parabolically as in Auden's poems
  of the early forties. Rather, the political was internalized, whether in
  the campy rhetoric of Ginsberg's &quot;America,&quot; or in O'Hara's unwillingness
  to rationalize everyday experience, or in the complex parodic versions
  of Ashbery's &quot;'They Dream Only of America',&quot; poems, where the
  political is always present, &quot;if you can find out what it is.&quot;
  In this sense, oppositional poetry of the fifties was cool rather than
  hot, mordant and witty performance rather than its more contemplative,
  engaged, and analytical European counterpart, as found, say, in the lyric
  of Paul Celan or Ingeborg Bachmann. War as daily reality (rather than as
  newspaper report or speculation about nuclear testing) seemed very far
  away. Thus, when actual revolutionary struggles occurred, as they did in
  Montgomery in January and in Hungary in October of '56, the poets seemed
  to be looking in some other direction. Rather like the riders on the trolley
  in Robert Frank's great photograph, looking out with rapt attention at
  the images going by, but remaining, at least for the moment, &quot;a step
  away from them.<BR>
