 What place does &quot;prose&quot;--or what looks like &quot;prose&quot;--have
in late twentieth-century poetry?   In his recent <I>Poet's
Prose:  The Crisis in American Verse</I>, Stephen Fredman
declares:  &quot;I have felt for a number of years that the most
talented poets of my own postwar generation and an increasing
number from previous generations have turned to prose as a form
somehow most consonant with a creative figuration of our time.&quot;
 Fredman proceeds to study the special kind of prose used by Williams
in <I>Kora in Hell</I>, by Creeley in <I>Presences</I>,
by Ashbery in <I>Three Poems</I>, and finally by such experimental
contemporaries as David Antin and the younger Language poets.
 At the same time, others have dismissed what we might call &quot;the
prose phenomenon&quot; as merely beside the point.  Denise Levertov,
for example, sees the prose texts of certain Language poets as
no more than &quot;re-hashed Gertrude Stein veneered with seventies
semantics.&quot;
<P>
 In his <I>Free Verse: An Essay on Prosody</I> (1980),
Charles O. Hartman takes what is surely the sensible position:
he adopts Jeremy Bentham's practical definition that &quot;when
the lines run all the way to the right margin it is prose; when
this fails to happen it is [verse].&quot;  Who can object to such
good common sense?  &quot;<I>Verse</I>,&quot; says Hartman,
&quot;<I>is language in lines</I>.  This distinguishes
it from prose. . . . This is not really a satisfying distinction,
as it stands, but it is the only one that works absolutely.  The
fact that we can tell verse from prose on sight, with very few
errors . . . indicates that the basic perceptual difference must
be very simple.  Only lineation fits the requirements.&quot;
<P>
 This definition is adequate enough if we bear in mind that it
distinguishes prose and <I>verse</I>, not prose and <I>poetry</I>.
 But although Hartman himself does recognize that &quot;'Prose-poems'
exist,&quot; most critics take the next step and equate poetry
with verse, as Hartman defines it.  Here is Richard A. Lanham's
account in <I>Analyzing Prose</I> (1983):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>To print utterances as prose amounts, in our time,
to a fundamental stylistic decision.   In prose we expect not
only a particular range of  topics but a transparent style to
 express them clearly. . .  . But with  poetry, just the opposite--
all the poetic virtues.   The poet need not be grammatically correct,
he'll talk about feeling not fact and he'll  do so in a self-conscious
metaphorical way.  We expect to look <I>through</I> prose,
to the  subject beneath, but <I>at</I> poetry where the
language forms part of the subject.</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
Lanham very sensibly points out that, as readers, we respond differently
to the print format of &quot;prose&quot; than to that of &quot;verse.&quot;
 But notice that the word <I>verse</I> is now, quite simply,
replaced by the word <I>poetry</I>, the implication being
that the two are identical.  It seems that in a century in which
&quot;free verse&quot; has largely superseded all the traditional
metrical forms, we must hold onto something to give us a sense
that poetry as a mode of discourse survives.  Lineation, the creation
of discourse that does not run all the way to the right margin,
is the saving grace.  Not that all lineated texts are good poems,
but it is their status as lineated texts that allows them to be
considered as poems in the first place.
<P>
 So much for the common wisdom.  A very different view is presented
in Henri Meschonnic's monumental study, <I>Critique du rythme:
Anthropologie historique du langage</I>.   &quot;Historically,
poetically, and linguistically,&quot; declares Meschonnic, &quot;there
are differences of degree, not of kind, between <I>the</I>
<I>proses and the verses</I>,&quot; and that, accordingly,
all binary models (verse / prose; image-full language / non-image-full
language; poetry as ordered language / prose as the absence of
order, and so on) are wholly reductive.  Even Bakhtin's famous
distinction between lyric poetry as monologic and prose fiction
as potentially dialogic crumbles, so Meschonnic argues, when applied
to say, Ezra Pound's <I>Cantos</I>.
<P>
 Meschonnic gives countless examples from around the world of
discourse that may be construed as &quot;prose&quot; or &quot;poetry,&quot;
as the case may be.  In the ninth century, the word <I>prose</I>
was used to refer to a liturgical prose sequence structured by
the assonance of <I>a</I>'s so as to prolong the sonority
of the <I>Allelulia</I>.  Eventually this recitative was
lineated and passed into the realm of &quot;poetry.&quot;  Or
again, Boris Eikhenbaum, studying the &quot;prose&quot; of Gogol's
<I>The Overcoat</I>, discovered that the ratio of accented
syllables to total number of syllables was precisely that of contemporary
iambic meter, as found in the poems of Mayakovsky (HM 461).
<P>
 Indeed, free verse &agrave; la Mayakovsky (a poet who echoed
Pound in his declaration that &quot;one must make verses with
all of one's life and not by fishing for trochees and iambs&quot;)
must, so Meschonnic argues, be construed historically.  &quot;Free
verse is just a passage, a moment, not only of a cultural situation,
but of the unity of discourse which contains it and which is the
poem.&quot;  For &quot;it is the poem that makes the free-verse
line, not the line that makes the poem&quot; (HM 605).  further,
the prominence of free verse must be understood as part of the
modernist destabilization of the notion of the poem as object.
 But the poet is no more &quot;free&quot; vis-&agrave;-vis the
alexandrine.  These forms are, after all, inscribed in a particular
culture; they are givens.  As Anthony Easthope puts it, &quot;Just
as poetry is always a specific poetic discourse, so line organization
[or non-linear organization] always takes a specific historical
form, and so is ideological.&quot;
<P>
 These are, I think, important reminders, for we tend to forget
that the poet is, as Meschonnic puts it, inevitably &quot;ventriloquized
by his or her tradition.&quot;  In this context, metrical choice
becomes an important indicator of the historical and cultural
formation in which it takes place.  The question for us, as readers
of contemporary poetry, is then not, &quot;Is it a good thing,
for, say, Lyn Hejinian to have written <I>My Life</I> in
prose?&quot; but rather, &quot;What does it mean that she chose
to do so?&quot;
<P>
 What I propose to do here is to historicize this question by
examining the status of four texts, each of which represent a
particular moment in the history, or, so to speak, the geography
of poetic form: (1) Goethe's early Romantic lyric, &quot;Wandrers
Nachtlied&quot; (&quot;Wanderer's Nightsong&quot;) of 1780, (2)
Arthur Rimbaud's prose poem &quot;Les Ponts&quot; (&quot;The Bridges&quot;)
of c. 1873, (3) William Carlos Williams's 1916 free verse poem,
&quot;Good Night,&quot; and (4) Samuel Beckett's 1972 composition
called &quot;Still.&quot;  All four refer to what is roughly the
same subject matter: a moment of silent contemplation when all
the elements of the scene stand out in sudden sharp relief.  But
between Goethe's &quot;Ruh&quot; and Beckett's &quot;Still,&quot;
two centuries have intervened: by 1972, when Beckett was composing
his text, the poet could not, in John Ashbery's words, &quot;say
it that way any more.&quot;  How and why this is the case is my
subject.<BR>

<P>
 Goethe's &quot;Wandrers Nachtlied (&quot;Wanderer's Nightsong&quot;)
was written on the night of 6 September 1780 in the mountains
at Ilmenau above Weimar, where Goethe had accompanied his master,
the young Duke Karl August.  It was first recorded, evidently
in a moment of inspiration, in pencil on the wall of the mountain
hut on the Gickelhahn, where the poet spent the night.  The same
evening, Goethe wrote one of his nightly letters to his mistress
Charlotte von Stein:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>  On the Gickelhahn, the highest peak of the range
. . . I have taken refuge, so as to  escape from the turmoil of
the town, the complaints, the demands, the hopeless confusion
 of mankind.  If I could only record all the thoughts I have had
today there would be  worthwhile things among them.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  My dearest, I descended into the Hermmansteiner
Cave, to the place where you  accompanied me, and found the S,
which stands out as sharply as if it had been carved  yesterday;
I kissed it and kissed it so often that the prophyry seemed to
give breath to  the scent of the whole earth as if in response.
 I prayed to the hundred-headed god who   has so greatly advanced
and changed me and yet has preserved your love and this cliff
for  me, to let me continue to grow and to make me more worthy
of your love.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The sky is quite clear and I am going out to enjoy
the sunset.  The view is  extensive but plain.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The sun has set.  It is the landscape of which
I made a drawing for you when it was  covered with rising mist.
 Now it is as clear and quiet as a large and beautiful Soul, at
its  calmest and most satisfied.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  If there weren't, here and there, some mists rising
from the mines, the whole  scene would be motionless.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>I shall come back to some key motifs in this
letter in a moment.  But first a few words about Goethe's situation
in 1780.  The poet was twenty-six when he came to weimar in 1775
at the invitation of the then eighteen-year-old Duke Karl August.
  His attendance at the small court was a means of escape from
the narrowly constricting life of Frankfurt and from his impending--and
dreaded--legal career.  The Weimar of the pre-Industrial period
was a small walled Lutheran city of some seven thousand inhabitants,
surrounded by the Thuringian Forests and beyond these, the Harz
Mountains.    The city itself had neither modern amenities nor
means of communication.  The unpaved roads were unlit at night,
there were no sewers, and coach travel was so precarious that
Goethe and his friends generally traveled on horseback.  When
Frederick the Great died, the news did not reach his niece, the
Dowager Duchess Amalia, until a week later.  The court circle
in what was a strictly stratified society spent its time in theatricals,
skating parties, and balls; the model was the French rococo court
even though the Weimar version was much cruder, less sophisticated.
 In the evenings the writers-in-residence, like von Knebel, Herder,
and Goethe himself, might read to the company or entertain them
with dramatic pieces.
<P>
 In his early Weimar years, Goethe spent much time with the young
duke on hunting trips and wild evening parties in the Harz Mountains.
 The pleasure-loving duke also had a real concern for his people,
and one of his accomplishments was the reopening of the stagnant
Ilmenau mines, to which the poet refers in his letter to Charlotte
von Stein.  The Harz expeditions thus gave Goethe a chance to
escape the social routine of Weimar and to dwell in what was still
an unspoiled natural world.  Yet even in the mountains there were
difficult human problems to be encountered: the &quot;turmoil
of the town&quot; to which Goethe refers in the letter is not
that of Weimar but of the village of Ilmenau, where Goethe had
to help the duke in various juridicial and financial matters.
 The mountain retreat, moreover, kept the poet away from his adored
mistress at a time when their affair was at its most intense:
in this particular week he often wrote her two or three times
a day.
<P>
 This is the setting of the poem called &quot;Wandrers Nachtlied&quot;:

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>In this seemingly simple little song, which
German schoolchildren learn by heart,  the rhythm of recurrence
is obviously predominant: the short, principally trochaic lines
alternate masculine and feminine rhymes and the vowel harmony
of <I>&uuml;</I>, <I>a</I>, <I>I</I>, <I>u</I>,
and the dipthongs <I>au</I> and <I>ei</I> create
an intricate echo structure, which is supported by the alliteration
of liquids and nasals.  &quot;The Wanderer's Nightsong&quot; might
almost be a folk song.
<P>
 But not quite.  Goethe's poem presents a harmony marked by difference.
 The very rhyme scheme is irregular, the pattern of the first
quatrain, <I>abab</I>, not being repeated by the second,
<I>cddc</I>.  More important, the lines are uneven:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   <FONT SIZE=2>&Uuml;ber allen Gipfeln</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   Ist Ruh</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
where the falling rhythm of the first suspended line receives
an answer from the single iamb of the second, the <I>u</I>
sound being thus prolonged.  The third line, &quot;In allen Wipfeln,&quot;
would be parallel to the first were it not foreshortened, and
the fourth, &quot;Sp&uuml;rest du,&quot; begins with a stress
and surprisingly rhymes a pronoun with the noun &quot;Ruh,&quot;
the line being enjambed so that the reader must take a short breath
before pronouncing the word &quot;Kaum.&quot;  The fifth line,
&quot;Kaum einen Hauch,&quot; is an amphibrach as is the eighth,
&quot;Ruhest du auch,&quot; which rhymes with it, although again
the rhyming partners are different parts of speech.  But the most
peculiar echo effect is reserved for lines 6-7:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>  <FONT SIZE=2>Die V&ouml;gelein schweigen im Walde.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   Warte nur, balde</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A nine-syllable line, predominantly dactyllic, is complemented
by the broken five-syllable line, the chiming &quot;Walde&quot;
/ &quot;balde&quot; being again suspended since meaning is deferred
(what is it that will happen soon [&quot;balde&quot;]?) until
the final line.
<P>
 The &quot;nightsong&quot; thus consists of a series of metrical
suspensions and vocalic echoes that move toward the resolution
of the final rhyme in one extended breath unit.  The key to this
echo structure is found, I think, in the use of the familiar second
person:  substitute &quot;Sp&uuml;re ich&quot; for the fourth
line or &quot;Ruhe ich&quot; in the eighth and the difference
becomes clear.  The &quot;song&quot; is the poet-wanderer's and
he addresses himself, or is it nature that addresses him, nature
that tells him, &quot;Warte nur, balde / Ruhest du auch&quot;?
 Or again, the use of &quot;du&quot; may imply that the wanderer's
song is for everyone, for all those who find themselves, as he
does, alone in the mountains preparing for the night's rest. 
The very birds are silent:  &quot;schweigen,&quot; a verb more
properly applied to persons, suggests that the birds are part
of the wanderer's world.  And further the syntax points to a moment
of future rest for mankind in general, perhaps to the final resting
place.
<P>
 Now consider the role in the poem of the speaking subject.  The
account of what the unnamed &quot;I&quot; sees and feels is presented
as reliable, indeed authoritative, the implication being that
it <I>is</I> possible to record such sensations as breathlessness
and the absence of bird song.  Further the second-person address
suggests that what is true for the poet is true in general (&quot;you&quot;
= &quot;one&quot;), that he is himself at one with the natural
world.  Nature, for Goethe, always wears the colors of the spirit,
or, in this case, imprint of the hundred-headed god (Vishnu) to
whom Goethe refers in the letter to his mistress.  We do not need
to inform ourselves about Goethe's botanic or anatomic studies,
his gradually evolving nature philosophy, to see that here, as
in the other poems of the period, the poet is positing the relation
of the One to the Many, of microcosm to macrocosm, of the &quot;I&quot;
to the &quot;other.&quot;  In the letter, we recall, Goethe speaks
of kissing the porphyry stone in the cave until it seemed to give
off the very breath of the earth;  just so, the poet feels (&quot;Sp&uuml;rest
du&quot;) the slightest breath that emanates from the treetops.
 Again, in the letter, Goethe describes the landscape as a &quot;large
beautiful soul at harmony with itself,&quot; an image conveyed
in the poem by the very verse structure with its vowel harmonies
and echoes.
<P>
 Yet Goethe's is not an innocent vision of a harmonious universe.
 The cautionary imperative &quot;Warte nur&quot; (&quot;Just wait&quot;)
suggests that &quot;Ruh&quot; (&quot;rest,&quot; &quot;peace,&quot;
&quot;quiet&quot;) is not always possible, that the &quot;Wanderer&quot;
is not always alone in his mountain retreat, that the silence
is welcome precisely because it is not the norm,  On the other
side of the forest are the mines at Ilmenau and, beyond the mines,
the descent into Weimar.  Three days after writing &quot;Wandrers
Nachtlied&quot; and still in his mountain retreat near Ilmenau,
Goethe writes Charlotte von Stein: &quot;This morning we had all
the murderers, thieves, and smugglers brought forward and we questioned
and confronted them all.  At first I didn't want to go, since
I shun that which is unclean&quot; (<I>Briefe</I> 317).
 In this context the &quot;Wanderer's Nightsong&quot; can be read
as something of a prayer, a song of longing for escape from that
which is unclean.
<P>
 All these tensions are expressed in the sound structure of the
poem.  Goethe's central conviction that the landscape is man's
natural habitat, his sense of himself as at once unique and yet
representative, his view of poetry as the fruit of a particular
experience, an experience to be &quot;objectified&quot; and universalized
by purging it of the merely personal and by recreating it in accord
with fixed metrical laws-- all these come together to create a
text that calls attention attention it to itself as a &quot;poem,&quot;
specifically a &quot;song,&quot; by foregrounding sound repetition
and stanzaic structure.  The stress on the natural is an indirect
comment on the artificialities of German rococo poetry of the
mid-eighteenth century; at the same time, Goethe's own lyric is,
as I have argued, a sophisticated poem that reflects its author's
social role and his manifold literary and scientific interests.
 The rhythm of recurrence is defamiliarized even as the very title,
&quot;Wandrer's Nachtlied,&quot; is self-conscious in its assumption
of rusticity.  For, despite its eventual popularity, Goethe's
poem is hardly intended as a folk song to be recited or sung by
the miners and peasants of Ilmenau.  Rather, in what will be a
characteristically romantic gesture, &quot;the natural&quot; is
transformed into &quot;the poetic&quot; by the equation of the
&quot;du&quot; with the poem's reader and by the creation of a
formal structure that enacts the &quot;Ruh&quot; of the opening
line. <BR>

<P>
 My second text, Rimbaud's prose poem &quot;Les Ponts&quot; (&quot;The
Bridges&quot;), which appeared in <I>Les Illuminations</I>,
was written in the early 1870s.  We have no hard information about
the circumstances of composition of the <I>Illuminations</I>,
but Rimbaud's editors suggest that &quot;Les Ponts&quot; was inspired
by a vision of London, which the poet had visited with Verlaine
in the autumn of 1872 and again in the spring of 1873, before
the tragic quarrel that led to Verlaine's shooting of Rimbaud
(and two-year imprisonment) and to Rimbaud's famous renunciation
of poetry at the age of nineteen.
<P>
 The landscape of &quot;Les Ponts&quot; inevitably reflects a
very different world from that of Goethe's Harz Mountains.  For
one thing, the relation of nature to the city had markedly changed.
 Charleville, Rimbaud's birthplace near the Belgian border (and
hence a battleground during the Franco-Prussian War), was a provincial,
unattractive village.  The child of small <I>propri&eacute;taires</I>,
mean-spirited, narrow-minded, and pious Catholics, Rimbaud could
hardly wait to escape to the City of Light.  Yet the Paris of
mid-century had become a locus of industrialization, poverty,
and pollution as well as of art and culture.  In one of his Maxims,
Goethe writes, &quot;Nature: we are surrounded and wrapped about
by her-- unable to break loose from her&quot;; by the time of
the Paris Commune in 1871 (an event in which the seventeen-year-old
Rimbaud participated), nature had withdrawn in the face of what
Engels called, with reference to London, &quot;this colossal centralization,
this heaping together of two and a half million human beings at
one point . . .   The hundreds of thousands of all classes and
ranks crowding past each other. . . . The brutal indifference,
the unfeeling isolation of each in his private interest.&quot;
<P>
 The dialect of the urban and the natural is one of Baudelaire's
great themes; for Rimbaud, however, the city becomes unreal, at
once beautiful and ugly, mysterious and terrifying, a created
world whose &quot;reality&quot; exists only in the self-sufficient
language field of the poem.  It does not really matter, then,
whether the site of &quot;Les Ponts&quot; is London Bridge, whether
Rimbaud's &quot;domes&quot; include the dome of St. Paul's, or
whether the body of water, &quot;as wide as an arm of the sea,&quot;
is the Thames.  For in the semiabstract verbal composition which
is &quot;Les Ponts,&quot; all these locales shed their &quot;realistic&quot;
identity.  Here is the prose poem:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2> Des ciels gris de cristal.  Un bizarre dessin de
ponts, ceux-ci droits, ceux-l&agrave;  bomb&eacute;s, d'autres
descendant ou obliquant en angles sur les premiers, et ces figures
se  renouvelant dans les autres circuits &eacute;clair&eacute;s
du d&ocirc;mes, s'abaissent et s'amoindrissent.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Quelques-uns de ces point sont encore charg&eacute;s
de masures.  D'autres soutiennent des  mats, des signaux, de fr&ecirc;les
parapets.  Des accords mineurs se croisent et filent, des  cordes
montent des berges.  On distingue une veste rouge, peut-&ecirc;tre
d'autres costumes et  des instruments de musique.   Sont-ce des
airs populaires, des bouts de concerts  seigneuriaux, des restant
d'hymnes publics?   L'eau est grise et bleue, large comme un 
bras de mer.-- Un rayon blanc, tombant du haut du ciel, an&eacute;antit
cette com&eacute;die.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>  Crystal gray skies.  A bizarre design of bridges,
some straight, some arched,  others descending or obliquing at
angles to the first ones, and these figures renewed in  the other
lighted circuits of the canal, but all so long and light that
the banks, laden with  domes, sink and diminish.  Some of these
bridges are still encumbered with hovels.   Others support masts,
signals, frail parapets.  Minor chords criss-cross and flow away,
 ropes rise from the banks.  One makes out a red jacket, perhaps
other costumes and  musical instruments.  Are these popular airs,
scraps of manorial concerts, remnants of  public hymns?  The water
is gray and blue, wide as an arm of the sea.-- A white ray,  falling
from the top of the sky, annihilates this comedy.<BR>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 I have discussed in <I>The Poetics of Indeterminacy</I>,
the semantic undecidability of Rimbaud's prose poems, the contradictory
connotations of images and word groups that make it all but impossible
to specify what it is that is being described.   Here, therefore,
let me merely point to such particulars as the instability of
the angle of vision from which the scene is recorded.  Such phrases
as &quot;on distingue&quot; (&quot;one makes out&quot;) or &quot;peut-&ecirc;tre&quot;
(&quot;perhaps&quot;) imply that the speaker is trying to report
faithfully what he sees.  But the &quot;bizarre design of bridges,&quot;
at once advancing and receding, is all but impossible to locate
in space.  The reference to &quot;masures&quot; (&quot;hovels&quot;),
for example, suggests that the observer is close to a particular
bridge; yet the references to crystal gray skies, the &quot;design&quot;
of arches and angles, and to the &quot;rives, charg&eacute;es
de d&ocirc;mes&quot; (&quot;banks, laden with domes&quot;), place
him at a great distance.  The landscape, for that matter, is less
that of reality than of a work of art, a protocubist painting,
say, by John Marin, even as phrases like &quot;accords mineurs&quot;
(&quot;minor chords&quot;) suggest a musical composition.  The
theatrical scene, in any case, dissolves when &quot;un rayon blanc,
tombant du haut du ciel, an&eacute;antit cette com&eacute;die.&quot;
 A white magical landscape of curves and domes, frail parapets
and hovels, collapses in a lightning flash&quot;;; the vision
or waking dream is over.
<P>
 But why did Rimbaud choose to present these visions, these &quot;Illuminations,&quot;
in the form of the prose poem?  Again, the verse form must be
understood intertextually.  If the rules of French versification
were not as rigid as they were, the nineteenth-century prose poem,
whose first great exemplar is found in Baudelaire's <I>Spleen
du Paris</I>, might not have come into being.  As stress-languages,
English and German allow for great flexibility in the formation
of lines; the French alexandrine however is based on syllable
count, and so effective versification becomes a matter of observing
certain norms:  the caesura dividing the two hemistichs, the avoidance
of hiatus, the alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes, and
so on.
<P>
 In his early poetry, Rimbaud, like Baudelaire before him, observed
these rules carefully.  LeRoy Breunig cites the lines from &quot;Les
Etrennes des Orphelins&quot;:
<P>

<P>
Here the first-line caesura follows &quot;ombre&quot; and the
twelve-syllable count includes the mute <I>&eacute;</I>'s
of &quot;pleine&quot; and &quot;vaguement&quot; but not of &quot;ombre,&quot;
which is followed by a vowel.  Beginning with &quot;Le Dormeur
du val,&quot; however, Rimbaud, as Breunig has shown, began to
dismember the alexandrine by introducing repeated enjambments
and misplaced caesuras and by ignoring the prescribed alternation
of rhymes.  By the time of &quot;M&eacute;moire&quot; and &quot;O
Saisons, &ocirc; ch&acirc;teaux,&quot; his poems were barely recognizable
as verse so that the &quot;leap into prose&quot; was a logical,
indeed, almost an imperceptible step.
<P>
 Rimbaud's prose poems should not, however, be construed as emblematic
of the poet's renunciation of lyric.  If the poet substitutes
linear progression for the rhythm of recurrence provided by meter
and rhyme, his formal structure is nevertheless &quot;free&quot;
only vis-&agrave;-vis &quot;les premiers romantiques&quot; like
Lamartine and especially Musset, whose work is dismissed in Rimbaud's
&quot;Lettres du Voyant&quot; of 1871: &quot;Musset is fourteen
times loathsome to us. . . . Of the insipid tales and proverbs!
 O the <I>Nuits</I>!  O <I>Rolla</I>  . . . it is
all French, namely detestable to the highest degree; French, not
Parisian.&quot;  Not Parisian, which is to say not like the first
great Parisian poet, Baudelaire, &quot;the first seer, king of
poets, <I>a real god!</I>&quot;   And yet Baudelaire too
is criticized for having lived in &quot;too artistic a milieu&quot;
and for lacking the courage to invent new forms.
<P>
 The &quot;Lettres du Voyant&quot; were written by a provincial
seventeen-year-old &quot;paysan&quot; who fought to clear a poetic
space for himself, to escape from the anxiety of influence by
being more Parisian than the sophisticated Parisian dandy, Baudelaire.
 &quot;Trouver une langue&quot; (&quot;To find a language&quot;)
in this context meant to write a prose poem, not narrative or
parabolic like Baudelaire's, but visionary.  &quot;Prose&quot;
was, moreover, in Rimbaud's day the vehicle for patient and &quot;realistic&quot;
description--one thinks immediately of the prose of Flaubert.
 To present the visionary, the magical, the artificial in prose
was thus to explode the medium in a way that suited the young
poet's need to shock, to be outrageous.  And indeed one starts
to read a text like &quot;Les Ponts&quot; with the expectations
that it will provide a &quot;picture&quot; of something.  &quot;Des
ciels gris de cristal&quot;-- the noun phrase promises a kind
of exposition, a coherent visual image, that the text will purposely
deflate.  Not that the syntax is unusual; the typical unit is
the simple declarative sentence: &quot;D'autres soutiennent des
m&acirc;ts, des signaux, de fr&ecirc;les parapets&quot; (&quot;Others
support masts, signals, frail parapets&quot;).  But within these
&quot;normal&quot; syntactic slots, we find references that make
no sense: what river-banks, for example, are &quot;laden with
domes&quot;?
<P>
 Yet--and this is the curious aspect of Rimbaud's prosody-- the
<I>Illuminations</I> don't really violate the norms of
nineteenth-century lyric.  As Albert Sonnenfeld puts it:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  It would be plausible and tempting to deduce that
the prose poem would, as the  enactment of freedom from the formal
constraints of prosody, aver itself as resolutely  anti-teleological
or anti-closural. . . . But . . . the <I>prose poem</I>,
though it may have  thrown off the shackles of a caducous tradition
of rhyme and meter, is formally a  profoundly conservative and
traditional structure in its ceremonials of entrance and  exit;
 no matter how radical its content, how relentless its striving
for apparent or  real incoherence, the prose poem undergoes the
secondary  elaboration of syntactical  coherence and its boundaries
most often are clearly defined and marked.</FONT>
<P>
This is an important point.  The meaning of the poet's vision
in &quot;Les Ponts&quot; may be undecidable, but formally  the
syntactically ordered series of sentences ends with the strongly
closural statement: &quot;Un rayon blanc, tombant du haut du ciel,
an&eacute;antit cette com&eacute;die&quot; (&quot;A white ray,
falling from the top of the sky, annihilates this comedy&quot;).
  Those who know the <I>Illuminations</I> will recognize
this as a typical ending: &quot;Aube&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;)
ends with the sentence, &quot;Au reveil il &eacute;tait midi&quot;
(&quot;At waking, it was noon&quot;); &quot;Nocturne vulgaire,&quot;
with &quot;Un souffle disperse les limites du foyer&quot; (&quot;One
breath disperses the limits of the hearth&quot;); and &quot;Parade,&quot;
with the assertion, &quot;J'ai seul la clef de cette parade sauvage&quot;
(&quot;I alone have the key for this wild show&quot;).  
<P>
 What does the drive toward syntactical coherence and closure
tell us?  The Rimbaud prose poem, we might say, is still governed
by romantic and symbolist norms in that it posits (1) that poetic
language is inherently different from &quot;ordinary&quot; language;
(2) that a poem is the site of lyric vision, of the sacred moment;
and (3) that a &quot;poem,&quot; whether in verse or in prose,
is a framed discourse, an object separable and distinct from the
encroaching discourses that surround it.  In Michel Beaujour's
words, &quot;A prose poem is a text where the verse density approaches
that of regular metrical forms, while eschewing the anaphoric
servitudes of prosody.&quot;  Its insistence on &quot;an absolute
distinction between journalistic cacography and artful writing
is purely ideological and does not stand up to linguistic and
rhetorical scrutiny:  it is all a question of taste, and should
ideology so decree, <I>bad</I> taste might become axiological
king of the castle.&quot;
<P>
 Both Sonnenfeld and Beaujour suggest that the nineteenth-century
French prose poem was thus a more conservative form, at least,
when read in the light of such later developments as Dada.  Perhaps
it would be fair to say that Rimbaud's brilliant prose poetry,
revolutionary as it conceives itself to be, and as it is with
respect to its ways of signifying, also bears the inscription
of the culture in which it was created, a culture that no longer
looks to nature as the guardian of its soul, and for whom &quot;Art&quot;
is, accordingly, as distinct from &quot;Life&quot; as possible.
 The poem, in other words, is regarded as an artifact, whether
it is written in the dense verse of the Symbolists or in prose.
 It was the free verse poetry of Apollinaire and Cendrars, of
Pound and Williams, of Mayakovsky and Khlebnikov, that was to
challenge this &quot;object&quot; status.

<P>
 Williams was thirty years old when he began, primarily under
the influence of Pound, to write in free verse, but he seems never
to have quite understood his own composing processes.   In 1913,
when the Imagist movement was at its height, he wrote an essay
called &quot;Speech Rhythm,&quot; in which he insisted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2> I do not believe in <I>vers libre</I>, this
contradiction in terms.   Either the motion  continues or it does
not continue, either there is rhythm or no rhythm.  <I>Vers
libre</I> is  prose.  In the hands of Whitman it was a good
tool. . . . {He] did all that was necessary  with it. . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Each piece of work, rhythmic in whole, is then
in essence an assembly of tides,  waves, ripples. . . .for me
the unit is of a convenient length, such as may be appreciated
 at one stroke of  the attention. . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The rhythm unit is simply any repeated sequence
of lengths and heights.  Upon  this ether the sounds are strung
in their variety.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here we must read between the lines or, I should say, the sentences.
 <I>Vers libre</I> was a term first used by Gustave Kahn
and his Symbolist cenacle in the 1880s; the early <I>vers librists</I>,
 such as Kahn himself, Jules Laforgue, Jean Mor&eacute;as, and
Henri de Regnier, wrote a slow, stately verse, characterized by
phrasal and clausal repetition and heavily end-stopped lines.
 It is this form of &quot;free verse&quot; that was adopted by
the British Imagists of the 1910s, a form undoubtedly too formal,
too restrained, and too &quot;foreign&quot; for a poet like Williams,
whose verse was to be more fluid, its &quot;waves&quot; and &quot;ripples&quot;
being less a matter of sound repetition or even of speech rhythm
than of sight.  &quot;Stanzas you can't quite <I>hear</I>,&quot;
as Hugh Kenner has put it.    Here is the first such stanza of
a poem called &quot;Good Night,&quot; originally published in
the New York magazine <I>Others</I> in 1916:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   <FONT SIZE=2>In brilliant gas light</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   I turn the kitchen spigot</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   and watch the water plash</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   into the clean white sink.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   On the grooved drain-board</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   to one side is</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   a glass filled with parsley--</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   crisped green.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>             Waiting</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   for the water to freshen--</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   I glance at the spotless floor--:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   a pair of rubber sandals</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   lie side by side</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   under the wall-table</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   all is in order for the night.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>Since this poem is paradigmatic of so much
that is to come in American poetry, its verse form demands careful
attention.  First, there is no rhyme scheme or stanzaic structure,
no fixed stress or syllable count.  The stresses range between
one (&quot;Wa&iacute;ting&quot;) and four (&quot;&iacute;nto the
cle&aacute;n wh&iacute;te s&iacute;nk&quot;), the syllables between
two (&quot;Waiting,&quot; &quot;crisped green&quot;) and eight
(&quot;All is in order for the night&quot;).  By definition, then,
&quot;Good Night&quot; is written in free verse, however much
Williams may have protested against the term.
<P>
 What is the ideology embodied in Williams's choice of free verse?
 Commenting on &quot;Good Night,&quot; Allen Ginsberg remarks:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The mundaneness is interesting to me, because it
sees so clearly that it becomes  crisp in meaning, still and shining.
 The water glass suddenly is a totemic object.  It  becomes a
symbol of itself, of his investment in his attention in that object.
. . . Because  he sees it so clearly, he notices . . . what's
particular about the object that could be  written down in a word--
he sees the object without association.  That's characteristic
 of visionary moments. . . . You are not super-imposing another
idea of another idea or  another image on the image that's already
there.</FONT>
<P>
Direct treatment of the thing, the absence of imposed symbolism<FONT SIZE=2>,
 </FONT>the act of attention that perceives the radiance in even
the most mundane of objects--these are qualities everyone has
noted in Williams's poetry, but an account like Ginsberg's does
not tell the whole story.  As a genuinely democratic American
poet, a physician in contact with the daily life of a lower-class
ethnic community, Williams obviously focuses, as no poet had since
Whitman, on the everyday, the seemingly trivial, the communal,
and as such, the argument usually goes, he had to cast off the
shackles of conventional metrical forms--forms he himself used
in his earliest poetry--and invent a form that would be &quot;free,&quot;
&quot;natural,&quot; and capacious.
<P>
 The problem with this argument is that Williams's poetry is not,
in fact, &quot;natural&quot; and lifelike.  Try, for example,
to imagine an occasion when someone would say:
<P>
  <FONT SIZE=2>In brilliant gas light I turn the kitchen spigot
and watch the water plash into the    clean white sink.  On the
grooved drain-board to one side is a glass filled with    parsley,
crisped green.</FONT>
<P>
To whom would one say this and in what voice?  Hugh Kenner is
surely right when he says, of the related poem, &quot;The Red
Wheelbarrow,&quot; &quot;Not only is what the sentence says banal,
if you heard someone say it, you'd wince.  But hammered on the
typewriter into a <I>thing made</I>, and this without displacing
a single word except typographically, the . . . words exist in
a different zone&quot; (HK 60).
<P>
 &quot;Hammered on the typewriter&quot;--this is, I think, is
the key to Williams's prosody: &quot;A poem,&quot; as he puts
it in the introduction to <I>The Wedge</I>, is &quot;a
small (or large) machine made of words.&quot;   Here Williams
gives voice to a poetic tht owes much to the avant-garde artists,
many of them expatriates, who came to New York during World War
I.  I have suggested elsewhere (MPPI 86) that Picabia's &quot;machine
drawings&quot; for <I>Camera Work</I> and <I>291</I>--
for example, his witty homage to Stieglitz (<I>Ici C'est Ici
Stieglitz / Foi et Amour)</I>, are in many ways the visual
counterparts of Williams's poems, in that ordinary objects like
cameras and spark plugs are transformed into semiabstract, simplified
geometric forms having an erotic life of their own.  Again, Williams's
minimal poems like &quot;The Red Wheelbarrow&quot; and the later
&quot;Between Walls&quot; have much in common with Duchamp's ready-mades:
in both cases it is a matter of lifting the saying out of the
zone of things said, of framing the given object, glass of water
or snow shovel, rubber sandals or bird cage, in a new way.
<P>
 Such &quot;framing&quot; or re-presenting has everything to do
with the technology of the early century: Williams is one of the
first poets to have composed directly on the typewriter (often
in moments snatched between patients); but the typewriter is only
a small part of the technology that includes the automobile (which
figures in so many of Williams's poems), the airplane, the telephone
(&quot;They call me and I go&quot;), the billboard, the newspaper
headline.  That technology was a threat to the environment--a
frequent theme of Williams-- doesn't change the fact that the
actual composition and dissemination of the poetic text itself
could now become technologized, a process that has gone much further
in our own time as a result of tape recordings, copying machines,
computer printouts, video screens, and so on.
<P>
 The immediate impact of technology on the Williams of 1916, in
any case, was a new form of typography and lineation.  In the
case of &quot;Good Night,&quot; it is lineation rather than the
pattern of stresses that guides the reader's eyes so that objects
stand out, one by one, as in a series of film shots: first the
gas light, then the spigot, then the plash of water, and finally
the &quot;clean white sink&quot; itself.  The eye moves slowly
so as to take in each monosyllable (all but four of the nineteen
words in the first four lines, all but twelve of the sixty-seven
words in the whole verse paragraph): &quot;in,&quot; &quot;gas,&quot;
&quot;light,&quot; &quot;turn,&quot; &quot;the,&quot; &quot;and,&quot;
&quot;watch&quot;. . . .   The sixth line is suspended: it asks,
what is it that is located &quot;to one side&quot;?  But what
does the parsley look and feel like?  Again a new line:
<P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>crisped green.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Next there is a wait as the water runs<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>from
the tap, and so &quot;Waiting&quot; gets a line to itself and
a prominent line at that because it is moved over toward the jagged
right margin of the poem.  Notice that the poem would <I>sound</I>
exactly the same if &quot;Waiting&quot; were aligned with &quot;crisped&quot;
and &quot;for&quot; at the left margin; the effect, in other words,
is entirely visual.  And again, the ensuing lines are characterized
by suspension: a &quot;pair of rubber sandals&quot; (line 12)
do what?  They &quot;lie side by side&quot; (line 13).  But where?
<P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>under the wall-table</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 As in Picabia's drawings, everyday objects are here granted a
curious sexual power: the &quot;pair of rubber sandals / under
the wall-table&quot; anticipating the final line of the poem,
&quot;I am ready for bed.&quot;  And yet the poet's separateness
is stressed: he does not participate in the life of the young
girls seen earlier that evening at the opera, the girls described
in stanza 2 are &quot;full of smells and / the rustling sounds
of / cloth rubbing on cloth and / little slippers on carpet.&quot;
 Rather, like the &quot;Parsley in a glass, / still and shining,&quot;
he &quot;yawn[s] deliciously&quot; to himself, knowing that he
will be alone in bed.
<P>
 Indeed, there is nothing inherently &quot;free&quot; about this
natural &quot;free verse&quot; poem, which is less a vision of
the mundane-turned-radiant than the creation of a field of force,
set in motion by the poet's desire.  Thus the sounds of the poem
do not quite chime:  &quot;light&quot; in line 1 receives what
is almost a response from &quot;spigot&quot; in the next line,
and when the full response comes in the &quot;white&quot; of line
4, the rhyme is internal, its harmony offset by the next word,
&quot;sink.&quot;  Again, vowel repetition is something of a tease,
visual chiming not always being matched by aural equivalence.
 The letter <I>I</I>, for example, appears ten times in
the nineteen words of the first sentence, but the phoneme may
be /I/ or /ay/ or even a /y/ glide as as in the second syllable
of &quot;brilliant.&quot;  Still, if one waits long enough, the
&quot;brilliant gas light&quot; of the opening line is greeted
by the rhyme of &quot;night&quot; in line 15.  Each line, for
that matter, waits for its fulfillment from the next, with &quot;Waiting,&quot;
coming, as it does, after &quot;crisped green,&quot; exerting
the central pull.  When, at the end of the poem, the parsley image
recurs--
<P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>Parsley in a glass,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>    still and shining,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>    brings me back</FONT>-- 
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
it is treated to characteristic Williams deflation: being &quot;brought
back&quot; is one thing, but life goes on:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
    <FONT SIZE=2>                           I take a drink</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>      I am ready for bed.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
And of course that's what the title has told us to begin with.
 &quot;It isn't what [the poet] <I>says</I> that counts
as a work of art, it's what he makes, with such intensity of perception
. . .&quot; (WCWE 257).  &quot;Good Night&quot; is, in the best
sense, a small machine made of words.<BR>

<B>The Third Rhythm<BR>
</B>

<P>
 Williams's poetry did not gain a wide readership until the last
decade or so of his life.    Since then, it has become increasingly
popular even as, ironically enough, the drive that brought into
being Williams's marvelous &quot;suspension-systems&quot; had
lost much of its force.  A second world war, a growing distrust
of technology, as well as the public acceptance of free verse
as, quite simply <I>the</I> poetic form of the dominant
culture, meant that defamiliarization had to come from new sources.
 In the later nineteenth century, the chief source of renewal
was, I have argued, prose--the prose of novelists like Stendhal
and Flaubert--that modernists from Rimbaud to Robert Lowell called
upon as a source of inspiration.  A hundred years later, a similar
turn toward prose has occurred, but the &quot;prose&quot; in question
is less that of the novel (a form also put in question) than that
of philosophy.  By the early seventies, American students were
eagerly citing Heidegger's definition of poetic speech: &quot;The
more poetic a poet is--the freer (that is the more open and ready
for the unforeseen) his saying--the greater is the purity with
which he submits what he says to an ever more painstaking listening,
and the further what he says is from the mere propositional statement
that is dealt with solely in regard to its correctness or incorrectness.&quot;
 In equating the &quot;poetic&quot; with a mode of receptive listening
and active speaking, rather than with any formal features, Heidegger
paves the way for a notion of &quot;poeticalness&quot; that regards
genre and, by extension, the question of meter and lineation,
as irrelevancies.  From the standpoint of poststructuralist theory,
poetry is no longer any one thing (the lyric, the language of
tropes, metered language, and so on) but rather that species of
<I>writing</I> that foregrounds upon the materiality of
the signifier, the coincidence between enunciation and enounced.
<P>
 Such coincidence cannot be achieved, so the argument goes, by
imposing on language an abstract pattern like the iambic pentameter.
 But since free verse has itself become conventionalized and subject
to a number of abstract paradigms, the &quot;rhythm of recurrence&quot;
has reared its head in new guises.  Consider Beckett's short texts,
known as &quot;residua&quot; (his own term), or &quot;lyrics of
fiction&quot; (Ruby Cohn's), or &quot;monologues,&quot; or, perhaps
most commonly, &quot;pieces.&quot;  Here is the opening page of
<I>Still</I>,  written in 1974 for William Hayter, who
illustrated it with a series of etchings (see figure 5.1) and
printed the verbal-visual text in his celebrated <I>Atelier
17</I>  in Paris.

<P>
This is approximately a third of the single seamless paragraph
which is <I>Still</I>, a paragraph that culminates with
the sentence, &quot;Leave it so all quite still or try listening
to the sounds all quite still head in hand listening for a sound&quot;
(51).   From &quot;still&quot; to &quot;sound&quot;--how does
Beckett's text proceed and how shall we characterize it?
<P>
 We may note, to begin with, that Beckett's syntactic units are
not, proper &quot;sentences&quot; at all.  Practically speaking,
we associate the sentence with a model of wholeness and completeness.
 The typical sentence, so to speak, enacts a plot: &quot;Pass
the sugar, please!&quot; or &quot;We were in class when the headmaster
came in, followed by a new boy, not wearing the school uniform,
and a school servant carrying a large desk&quot; (<I>Madame
Bovary</I>).  The sentence, says Stephen Fredman common-sensically,
&quot;is a primary unit of writing whose purpose is to organize
language and thought upon a page. . . . The period posits closure
to a string of words; it asks us to regard the words between itself
and the preceding period as a unit&quot; (SFPP 29-30).  Thus the
opening sentence of <I>Madame Bovary</I>, which I cited
above, is followed by the second sentence, &quot;Those who had
been asleep woke up, and everyone rose as if just surprsied at
his work.&quot;  Indeed a unit.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>But now look at the first two sentences of
<I>Still</I>:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Bright at last close of a dark day the sun shines
out at last and goes down.  Sitting  quite still at valley window

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>The unit of rhythm here and throughout <I>Still</I>
is a short phrase of irregular length and primitive syntax (&quot;n&oacute;rmally
t&uacute;rn he&aacute;d n&ocirc;w and s&eacute;e &icirc;t&quot;),
a phrase heavily accented, discontinuous, and repetitive--a kind
of shorthand by means of which the human consciousness tries to
articulate what it perceives and remembers.  Indeed, this version
of what Henri Meschonni calls the &quot;third rhythm&quot; is
no closer to prose than to verse: &quot;The prose of the poem
moves in a direction that is, despite all appearances, the opposite
of the prose poem.  The prose of the poem . . . is the <I>mise
&agrave; nu</I> of the subjective character of rhythm, the
rapport between the rhythm of discourse and the speaking subject&quot;
(HM 610-11).
<P>
 This is not to say that the &quot;third rhythm&quot; is another
name for the stream of consciousness.  In the twenty-one line
unit before us, the word &quot;still&quot; appears eleven times
in a complex series of permutations: &quot;quite still&quot; (three
times), then &quot;unseeing still while still light&quot; (where
the monosyllabic word can be adjective [&quot;silent,&quot; &quot;motionless&quot;]
or adverb [&quot;yet&quot;]), then &quot;Quite still again,&quot;
and so on.  At the same time the words modifying &quot;still&quot;
gradually become nodal points, as when &quot;Quite still again&quot;
modulates into &quot;quite quiet apparently,&quot; or when &quot;Eyes
that open again while still light&quot; becomes &quot;Quite still
again then at open window.&quot;
<P>
 But further, <I>Still</I> is, in Enoch Brater's words,
&quot;a verbal journey in disorienting repetition highlighting
inversion, opposition, and indeterminacy.&quot;  That which is
&quot;still&quot; is &quot;not still at all&quot; or &quot;trembling
all over.&quot;  Or again, we meet the oppositions &quot;see&quot;/
&quot;unseeing,&quot; &quot;rise&quot;/ &quot;fall,&quot; &quot;far&quot;/
&quot;near,&quot; &quot;western / eastern,&quot; &quot;sunrise&quot;
/ &quot;sunset,&quot; &quot;quite&quot; / &quot;not quite,&quot;
and so on.  Verbal slippage is likely to turn &quot;quite&quot;
into &quot;quiet,&quot; &quot;end of rests&quot; into &quot;rest
on ends,&quot; &quot;quite still&quot; into &quot;till quite.&quot;
 &quot;Stillness,&quot; in other words, is anything but &quot;still&quot;:
everything in this texts moves, shifts, changes before our very
eyes and ears.
<P>
 But <I>Still</I> is by no means an exercise in abstraction.
 It is &quot;about&quot; a person sitting at a window, who watches
the sun set.   Although the figure's gender is not specified,
there are references to eyes, a skull, head, cheekbone, nape,
breast, forearms, arms, elbow, hands, thumb, index, fingers, trunk,
knees, and legs.  But there is no indication as to how these &quot;spare
parts&quot; relate to one another or to the body in the &quot;small
upright wicker chair armrests&quot; to which they presumably belong.
 As in Hayter's illustration, the figure's position is viewed
mathematically rather than in human, let alone individual terms.
 We know only that, in the course of the narrative, it is becoming
darker (though not dark) and that the &quot;right hand&quot; is
finally raised in a motion that seems to mimic the circle of the
sun &quot;till elbow meeting armrest brings this last movement
to an end and all still once more.&quot;
<P>
 But whose is the voice that tells us these things?  The text
gives us contradictory signals.  &quot;Bright at last close of
a dark day the sun shines out at last and goes down&quot;:  the
voice that utters these words is not identifiable; it could be
that of the figure in the wicker chair or that of a companion
or again of an impersonal narrator.  In the next sentence, &quot;normally
turn head now&quot; suggests that the speaker is the person in
the chair, but &quot;Always quite still some reason&quot; (sentence
3) implies the opposite in that the reason is not known.  In sentence
4, the phrase &quot;Eyes stare out unseeing till first movement&quot;
positions the observer outside the subject of the discourse, as
does &quot;quite quiet apparently&quot; in the next sentence.
 But the angle of vision continues to shift: there is, in fact,
no identifiable narrator who can bring these disparate references
together for us.
<P>
 In Goethe's &quot;Wandrers Nachtlied,&quot; we find an &quot;I&quot;
aware of itself and of its feelings, a coherent &quot;I&quot;
in control of the situation.  When the poet declares &quot;Die
V&ouml;gelein schweigen im Walde,&quot; the reader accepts the
statement as valid, given the particular context of the speech.
 In Rimbaud's &quot;Les Ponts,&quot; the relationship between
the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;other&quot; becomes more problematic:
 it is not clear, say, whether the minor chords that criss-cross
and flow away are <I>outside</I> the self or are part of
its mental landscape.  This disappearance of the distinction between
subject and object is equally marked in Williams's &quot;Good
night,&quot; in whose field of copresence the &quot;I&quot; and
the sprig of parsley in the glass become one.  But in Beckett's
<I>Still</I>, the question of copresence gives way to a
doubt as to the very existence of a unitary represented speaker.
 The inflections of the speaking voice, coming to us in short
repetitive phrases, each permutating what has come before, give
us no hint as to a controlling presence.  To whom, for example,
do we attribute the words &quot;Arms likewise broken right angles
at the elbows&quot;?  To the narrator?  The person in the chair?
 Or are these one and the same?  Under such circumstances, the
subject position, no longer granted to an identifiable or consistent
speaker, can only be assumed by the reader.
<P>
 In this context, we can see more clearly the function of the
&quot;third rhythm&quot; in this and related texts.  <I>Still</I>
is a single paragraph because for Beckett there is no separation
between different voices or different levels of discourse.  Beckett's
composition cannot avail itself of such imposed patterns as meter
or stanzaic structure; even lineation may seem too restrictive
a device, although the fact is that many poems that make use of
the associative of third rhythm are lineated: the &quot;prosaic&quot;
rhythms of John Ashbery, not essentially different from the rhythms
of his prose work <I>Three Poems</I>, are a case in point.
 Consider the following examples:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>(1) It was only much later that the qualities of
the incadescent period became apparent,  and by then it had been
dead for many years.  But in recalling itself it assumed its first
 real life.  That time was for living without the reflection that
gives things and objects a  certain relief, or weight; one drank
the rapture of unlived moments and it blinded one to  how it looked
from outside . . .<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2> (2)   All that we see is penetrated by it--</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The distant treetops with their steeple (so</FONT>

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  A present that is elsewhere.<BR>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first passage comes from Ashbery's <I>Three Poems</I>;
the second is the opening stanza of the title poem of <I>As
We Know</I>.    Both deal with the nameless &quot;it&quot;
that haunts our experience, the privileged moment that we await
even as we doubt that it exists.  The first passage is in prose,
the second in a purposely &quot;prosaic&quot; free verse, the
rhythms almost coalescing into blank verse in line 2, only to
be dispersed, by the time we reach line 5, into a kind of poulter's
rhythm carried through sixteen syllables.  Indeed, the &quot;verse&quot;
of &quot;As We Know&quot; is surely closer to the &quot;prose&quot;
of <I>Three Poems</I> than it is, say, to the verse of
Williams's &quot;Good Night,&quot; not to mention Goethe's &quot;Wandrers
Nachtlied.&quot;  To articulate a line like &quot;All that we
s&eacute;e is p&eacute;netr&aacute;ted by &iacute;t,&quot; with
its clumsy shift, in the sixth syllable from iamb to trochee and
then back again, is to imply that a larger harmony is no longer
a meaningful possibility.  The same &quot;point&quot; is made
in Charles Bernstein's &quot;That Klupzy Girl&quot;:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>Poetry is like a swoon, with this difference:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  it brings you to your senses.  Yet his</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  parables are not singular.  The smoke from</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  the boat causes the men to joke.  Not</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  gymnastic: pyrotechnic.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Not pretty, we might paraphrase this, ugly, with the line being
a yardstick produced only to violate it.
<P>
 It is one of the ironies of contemporary poetic discourse that
the associative rhythm, the rhythm derived from speech, should
become pervasive at the very moment when poets like Beckett and
Ashbery, and especially  Language poets like Bernstein, are positing
what we might call the absence of the pronoun, at the moment when
it is often impossible to decide whether the speaker is a &quot;he&quot;
or an &quot;I&quot; or &quot;you,&quot; much less what the &quot;I&quot;
or &quot;you&quot; might be like.  Perhaps it is the poet's sense
that at a time when the spoken and written word are more pervasive
than ever, when our visual fields are bombarded by billboards
and manuals, and our aural fields by overheard snatches of conversation
and catchy television jingles, the individual voice can no longer
be In Charge.  Rather, the text gives the impression that the
story is telling itself, that it is available for communal use--a
kind of score that we endow with meaning by &quot;speaking it&quot;
ourselves.
<P>
 Here an anecdote is apposite.  In October 1969, when the Nobel
Committee awarded Beckett that year's prize, the writer and his
wife were vacationing in the tiny Tunisian village of Nabeul.
 Before they could be located, the frantic editor of a Norwegian
newspaper contacted the <I>Irish Times</I> and tried to
get information about the writer, but since Beckett had not lived
in Dublin for years and was a resident of Paris, the editor got
nowhere.  The situation was not much better in Paris, where many
reporters could not even find Beckett's address.  While  this
scramble for news was going on, heavy rainstorms in Tunisia cut
off the ocean village from the desert mainland.  In the French
press, Beckett was accordingly dubbed &quot;un inconnu c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;Un inconnu c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.&quot;  The Unnameable
is a far cry from the Goethe of 1780 who explains to Charlotte
von Stein the precise thoughts and feelings that animate his poems,
poems that will be read, in Weimar and beyond, as versions of
his own life.  Yet just as Goethean lyric gives expression to
a particular view of natural process, so Beckett's <I>Still</I>
employs a rigorous structure of sound repetitions and permutations
that convey the tension between &quot;still&quot; and &quot;trembling
all over,&quot; between silence and the awaited sound, between
the short I of <I>Still</I> and the long <I>I</I>
of &quot;light&quot; as in the construction &quot;unseeing still
while still light.&quot;  Or consider the following sound chiming
found in the first five sentences alone:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>bright--shines--quite--upright--eyes--while--light--last--still--
stand--    still--past--armrests--stare--past--close--goes--go--low--afterglow--open-
   -close--sitting--still--it--window--still--it--still--in--window--wicker--
     till--still--still.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>This chiming continues throughout the text.
 Indeed, at the climactic moment when the hand of the unknown
person is raised in the air, Beckett introduces what can be transcribed
as two lines of blank verse:
<P>
  <FONT SIZE=2>till m&iacute;dway t&oacute; the he&aacute;d it
h&eacute;sit&aacute;tes</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  and h&aacute;ngs h&aacute;lf &oacute;pen tr&eacute;mbling
&iacute;n m&icirc;d a&iacute;r.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
But no sooner are we lulled by the familiar meter, than it is
replaced by the choppy rhythms of:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>H&aacute;ngs th&ecirc;re</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  as if h&aacute;lf incl&iacute;ned to ret&uacute;rn</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  th&aacute;t &icirc;s</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  s&iacute;nk b&acirc;ck sl&oacute;wly</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
and then by the sober scientific discourse of &quot;thumb on outer
edge of right socket index ditto left and middle on left cheekbone.&quot;
 Only when we come to the end of the text do we realize that we
have all along been &quot;listening [&quot;list&quot; is an anagram
for &quot;still&quot;] for a sound&quot;--a sound we can only
imagine because none has been described in the text.
<P>
 Beckett's principle of exclusion is thus rigorous: no colors,
no dialogue, no specifiers, no identifiable sounds.  Perhaps for
that very reason, the final statement of desire comes across as
deeply poignant:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>Le&aacute;ve it s&oacute;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  &aacute;ll qu&iacute;te st&iacute;ll</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  or try l&iacute;stening to the so&uacute;nds</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  &aacute;ll qu&iacute;te st&iacute;ll</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  he&aacute;d in h&aacute;nd</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  l&iacute;stening for a so&uacute;nd.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>&quot;The same sound,&quot;<FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>in Wallace Stevens's words, &quot;in the same bare place.&quot;
 Isn't Beckett's &quot;song,&quot; after all, a late twentieth-century
version of
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Die V&ouml;gelein schweigen im Walde.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Warte nur, balde</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  Ruhest du auch?</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Yes and no.   Yes, in the sense that there is, of course, no new
subject matter, only the old subject matter rendered in new ways.
 But to call a poem a new &quot;version&quot; of an earlier one
is also to admit that has become something else.  In the late
twentieth century, to write, for example, a straightforward &quot;Ubi
sunt&quot; poem on the medieval model is hardly an available option,
even as poets will continue to spin ironic and parodic fantasies
on this time-honored topos.
<P>
 By the same token, we must realize that the choice of verse form
is not just a matter of individual preference, a personal decision
to render a particular experience as a sonnet rather than a ballad,
a prose poem rather than a free verse lyric, and so on.  For the
pool of verse and prose alternatives available to the poet at
any given time has already been determined, at least in part,
by historical and ideological considerations. &quot;A mythology,&quot;
as Stevens put it, &quot;reflects its region.&quot;
