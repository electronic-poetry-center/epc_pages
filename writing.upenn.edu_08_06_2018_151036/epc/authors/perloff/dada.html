<P>
 A recently produced Dada Website gives us the following definition
of Dada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT SIZE=2>Dada </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>(French:
'hobby-horse'), nihilistic movement in the arts that flourished
 primarily in Zurich, New York City, Berlin, Cologne, Paris, and
Hannover, Ger. in  the early twentieth-century. . . . the name
was adopted at Hugo Ball's Cabaret (Caf&eacute;) Voltaire, in
Zurich, during one of the meetings held in 1916 by a group of
young artists  and war resisters that included Jean Arp, Richard
H&uuml;lsenbeck, Tristan Tzara, Marcel  Janco, and Emmy Hennings;
when a paper knife inserted into a French-German  dictionary pointed
to the word dada, this word was seized upon by the group as  appropriate
for their anti-aesthetic  creations and protest activities, which
were  engendered by disgust for bourgeois values and despair over
World War I.  A precursor  of what was to be called the Dada movement,
and ultimately its leading member, was  Marcel Duchamp, who in
1913 created his first ready-made (now lost) the &quot;Bicycle
 Wheel,&quot; consisting of a wheel mounted on the seat of a stool.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
 The last sentence in this otherwise unexceptional entry is odd
on two counts.  First, the notion that a movement's precursor
goes on to become its &quot;leading member&quot; suggests that
the man is somehow equivalent to the movement: <I>Dada, c'est
Duchamp</I>.  And secondly, the emphasis on individuality
(&quot;the leading member&quot;) seems misplaced in the discussion
of avant-gardes, the avant-garde being by accepted definition
a congerie of group manifestations, of agonistic movements that
set themselves against the status quo.  From the Lenin of <I>What
is to be Done</I> (1902), who referred to the Communist Party
as the &quot;politically conscious avant-garde of the entire working
class,&quot;  to the Peter B&uuml;rger of the still seminal <I>Theory
of the Avant-Garde</I>  (1980, trans. 1984), the emphasis
of avant-garde studies has been on movements rather than individuals.
  Indeed, the central distinction between the art of &quot;bourgeois
autonomy&quot; and the avant-garde,  B&uuml;rger argues, is that
whereas bourgeois production is &quot;the act of an individual
genius,&quot; the avant-garde &quot;responds with the radical
negation of the category of individual creation.&quot;  And not
only individual creation but reception as well. Remarking on the
&quot;collective reception&quot; accorded to Dada and Surrealist
works, B&uuml;rger observes that &quot;Breton and Tzara . . .lose
their meaning as producers and recipients; all that remains is
art as an instrument for living one's life.&quot;
<P>
 Yet--and this is the paradox-- as in the case of the Dada website,
B&uuml;rger's Exhibit A for the &quot;radical negation of the
category of individual creation&quot; is Duchamp:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>When Duchamp signs mass-produced objects . . . and
sends them to art exhibits, he negates the category of individual
production.  The signature is inscribed on an arbitrarily chosen
mass product because all claims to individual creativity are to
be mocked.   Duchamp's provocation not only unmasks the art market
. . . it radically questions the very principle of art in bourgeois
society according to which the individual is considered the creator
of the work of art.  Duchamp's<I> Ready-Mades are not works
of art but manifestations</I>.  </BLOCKQUOTE>(BUR 51, my emphasis)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
&quot;Not works of art but manifestations<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;:
 </FONT>here<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>B&uuml;rger echoes<FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>Walter Benjamin's famous observation that &quot;what the
Dadaists . . . intended and achieved was a relentless destruction
of the aura of their creations.&quot;   And the emphasis on group
provocation recalls Renato Poggioli's now classic discussion of
the anti-traditionalism, agitation, and agonism that characterize
the avant-garde.   &quot;We must never forget,&quot; writes the
leading Duchamp scholar Michel Sanouillet, &quot;that Dada was
a group of people closely knit together, a <I>bund</I>,
whose purposes were identical, and who had banded together their
talents and energies to wage an  excruciating war against society
as a whole.  That is why we find constant references, in the members's
own writings, to Dada as a collective being.&quot;  
<P>
  How do we reconcile such claims for Duchamp's <I>bund</I>-identity
with his own commentary on Dada and with the nature of his work
itself?  Asked by Pierre Cabanne to comment on his relationship
with Dada,  Duchamp remarks that he first came across the word
&quot;in Tzara's book, <I>The First Celestial Adventure of
Mr. Fire Extinguisher</I>--1917, or end of 1916.  It interested
us but I didn't know what Dada was, or even that the word existed.&quot;
 By 1917, Duchamp had produces many of his most famous &quot;readymades&quot;
(<I>Chocolate Grinder</I>, <I>Bicycle Wheel</I>,
<I>Bottle Rack</I>, <I>Fountain</I>, and <I>With
Hidden Noise</I> [Figures 1-5] as well as a series of studies
for the <I>Large Glass</I> [<I>The Bride Stripped Bare
By Her Bachelors, Even</I>] like <I>The Passage from the
Virgin to the Bride</I> [Figure 6] and <I>9 Malic Moulds</I>
[Figure 7].   &quot;Dada,&quot; Duchamp insists again and again
in his later years, did not influence his own work.  'It was parallel,
if you wish. . . . It [my own work] wasn't Dada, but it was in
the same spirit, without, however, being in the Zurich spirit&quot;
(CAB 56).   
<P>
 One can argue, of course, that Duchamp's disclaimers, here and
elsewhere, are just a smokescreen, designed to enhance his own
status and obscure the very real affinities between himself and
Dada --affinities art historians and critics are able to identify
even as the artist denies their existence.  But in Duchamp's case,
it is, ironically, the very critics who have written eloquently
of Dada and related movements, who are now singling out Duchamp
as special case.  Thus Rudolf E. Kuenzli and Francis Naumann subtitle
their recent collection of essays on Duchamp <I>Artist of the
Century</I>, and Arthur Danto has remarked that  &quot;The
story of the avant-garde in the twentieth century, whether in
America or in Europe, seems largely to be the story of Duchamp.&quot;
<P>
 Strong words, these, written at the end of a century that has
prided itself on repudiating the excesses of genius theory.  How
do we square Danto's statement with B&uuml;rger's negation-of-autonomy
thesis?   If Dada was, as Sanouillet says, a &quot;collective
being&quot; whose members shared &quot;identical purposes,&quot;
how and why has Duchamp come to tower over, say, Hugo Ball or
even his close friend Fran&ccedil;ois Picabia?  And how typical
of movement ethos and evolution is the case of Dada / Duchamp?
 In what follows I want to consider these vexed questions.

<BR><BR><BR>
<B>1.  Dada Dossier</B>
<BR>

<P>
 The classic account of Dada is probably Hans Richter's <I>Dada
Art and Anti-Art</I>, first published in German in Cologne
in 1964 and widely reprinted and translated.   Richter writes
as an insider, himself a member of the original Zurich c&eacute;nacle.
 &quot;The life we led,&quot; he tells us in his Foreword, &quot;our
follies and our deeds of heroism, our provocations, however 'polemical'
and aggressive they may have been, were all part of a tireless
quest for an anti-art, a new way of thinking, feeling and knowing.&quot;
<P>
 Richter begins with the now familiar story of the Cabaret Voltaire,
where Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janco, Richard Huelsenbeck,
and Hans Arp came together.   And although he claims that &quot;Dada
had no unified formal characteristics as have other styles&quot;
(HR 9), that it is characterized only by its &quot;destruction
of all artistic forms . . . a raging <I>anti, anti, anti</I>&quot;
(HR 35), he is soon discussing the defining Dada modes and genres.
 For example:
<P>
(1) The <I>simultaneous poem</I>, as defined by Ball: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>A contrapuntal recitative in which three or more
voices speak, sing, whistle, etc., simultaneously in such a way
that the resulting combinations account for the total effect of
the work, elegiac, funny or bizarre.  The simultaneous poem is
a powerful illustration of the fact that an organic work of art
has a will of its own, and also illustrates the decisive role
played by accompaniment.  Noises (a drawn-out rrr sustained for
minutes on end, sudden crashes, sirens wailing) are existentially
more powerful than the human voice.  (HR 29-30)</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P>
An example was the collaborative <I>Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur
und dem Spazierstock </I>( <I>The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's
Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick)</I>, written spontaneously
by Arp, Tzara, and Walter Serner while lounging in the Caf&eacute;
de la Terrasse.  The simultaneous poem, Richter claims, looks
ahead to automatic poetry, which &quot;springs directly from the
poet's bowels or other organs which have stored up reserves of
usable material&quot; (HR 30).  And further: the <I>po&egrave;me
simultan&eacute;</I> &quot;carries the message that mankind
is swallowed up in a mechanistic process&quot; (HR 31), a reference
to the horrors of the war.  An offshoot of the simultaneous poem
was the &quot;phonetic&quot; or &quot;abstract&quot; poem, which
used only non-semantic sound, as in Ball's famous &quot;<I>gadji
beri bimba gandridi laula lonni cadori</I>,&quot; and, a few
years later Kurt Schwitters' famous <I>Ursonate</I> (see
HR 42, 142). Phonetic poetry looks ahead to <I>lettrisme</I>
and the sound poetry of the 1960s.
<P>
(2)  The agonistic <I>manifesto</I>, as initially produced
by Tzara.  Richter recognizes (and I have written of this elsewhere)
that the Dada &quot;aggressive, polemical manifesto&quot; owes
a great deal to Futurism, especially so far as typography and
layout are concerned, but he distinguishes between the programmatic
Futurist manifestos and Dada's anti-programmatic stance (HR 33-35).
<P>
(3) The <I>exhibition</I>, conceived by Ball as <I>Gesamtkunstwerk</I>
in its conjunction of lectures, readings and ballets with paintings.
 The <I>Der Sturm</I> exhibition held at the Munich Galerie
Dada in 1917, for example, incorporated the work of Kandinsky
and Klee (and of Richter himself) into the Zurich movement and
provided linkage to the earlier Expressionists (see HR 39).  The
Dada exhibition leads to performance art and installation, as
we now know these art forms.
<P>
(4) <I>Abstract painting,</I> as produced by Hans Arp [Figure
8], Sophie-Tauber Arp, Marcel Janco, and Richter himself, as an
effort to purify the imagination.  Abstraction was not, of course,
the invention of Dada (Malevich had already painted the <I>Black
Square</I>), but Richter claims it as Dada revolution: &quot;everything
must be pulled apart, not a screw left in its customary place,
the screw-holes wrenched out of shape. . . . the total negation
of everything that had existed before&quot; (HR 48).
<P>
(5)  <I>Collage</I>, made from ordinary materials like
cardboard, wire, train tickets, and newspaper fragments, as exemplified
by Kurt Schwitters's <I>Merz</I> works [Figure 9], and
<I>photomontage</I>, as in Raoul Hausmann's and John Heartfield's
&quot;cut up photographs, stuck . . .together in provocative ways,&quot;
and collaged with bits of newspapers, old letters, or whatever
happened to be lying around so as &quot;to confront a crazy world
with its own image&quot; (114; Figure 10).  These German Dada
works had a much more overt political content than did the more
abstract collages of Arp and Richter himself.
<P>
(6) The <I>Chance Work</I>, as in Tzara's &quot;word salads,&quot;
made of newspaper scraps, arbitrarily drawn from a hat, or Arp's
discovery that discarded scraps of paper, falling on the floor,
could make unconscious patterns more interesting than those the
artist had consciously designed [see figure 9].  The adoption
of chance, writes Richter, &quot;restore[d] to the work of art
its primeval magic power . . . . &quot;the incantatory power tht
we seek, in this age of general unbelief, more than ever before&quot;
(HR 59).
<P>
 It is interesting that Duchamp, whose work is discussed in the
chapter called &quot;New York Dada 1915-1920,&quot; is, for Richter,
the epitome of the new Dada &quot;non-art,&quot; the &quot;emptying
[of] life as well as art of all its spiritual content&quot; (HR
91).  Richter, like almost all later writers on the subject, focuses
on the proto-Dada spirit associated with Alfred Stieglitz's <I>Camera
Work</I> (later <I>291</I>) and his <I>291</I>
Gallery, with Picabia's machine drawings and Duchamp's <I>readymades</I>
and <I>Large Glass</I>, the latter as ultimate exemplar
of &quot;anti-art,&quot; and with the periodicals <I>The Blind
Man</I>, <I>Rongwrong</I> (both 1917), and <I>New
York Dada</I> (1921), all three of which were edited by Duchamp
and Man Ray.  Duchamp's <I>Chocolate Grinder</I> was reproduced
on the cover of the first issue of <I>The Blind Man</I>,
his witty perfume flask <I>Belle Haleine</I> bearing on
its neck a photograph of Duchamp dressed up as his alter ego Rrose
S&eacute;lavy on the cover of the only issue of <I>New York
Dada</I> [see Figure 11]..  
<P>
 In the early twenties, when Paris Dada became prominent, Duchamp
adopted an ambiguous stance toward the movement.  On the one hand,
he was happy to engage in some Dada publicity:  his <I>Nude
Descending a Staircase</I>, for example, is featured next
to a Louis Aragon poem and Picabia's &quot;Portrait de Tristan
Tzara,&quot; in an article for the <I>New York Evening Journal</I>
(January 29, 1921), which bears the headline  &quot;Dada Will
Get You if You Don't Watch Out: It Is on the Way Here,&quot; with
the subhead &quot;Paris Has Capitulated to New Literary Movement;
London Laughs, but Will Probably Be Next Victim, and New York's
Surrender Is Just Matter of Time&quot; [Figure12].   In response
to the question &quot;What is Dada?&quot;, posed by the <I>Journal</I>'s
reporter of a number of artists gathered at Katherine Dreier's
Societ&eacute; Anonyme on East 47th Street, Duchamp echoes Tzara's
own cited definition: &quot;Dada is nothing. . . . For instance
the Dadaists say that everything is nothing; nothing is good,
nothing is interesting, nothing is important.  It is a general
movement in Paris, relating rather to literature than to painting&quot;
(NYD 140).   And later in the interview, &quot;Painting has already
begun to tear down the past--why not literature? . . . . But then
I am in favor of Dada very much myself&quot; (NYD 142).
<P>
 Even as he was making this declaration, however, Duchamp was
distancing himself from the Paris Dada scene that prompted the
<I>Evening Journal</I> article.  When his sister Suzanne,
now married to his friend, the artist Jean Crotti, suggested Duchamp
send something for the Dada Salon Tzara was organizing at the
Galerie Montaigne,  Duchamp responded that &quot;<I>exposer</I>,&quot;
sounded too much like &quot;<I>&eacute;pouser</I>&quot;
 (see CTD 236), and when Tzara himself repeated the request, Duchamp
sent a telegram that contained the three  words &quot;PODE BAL--
DUCHAMP&quot; with its pun on &quot;peau de balle&quot; or &quot;balls
to you.&quot;   Thus, when the exhibition was mounted, the spaces
reserved for Duchamp's works were occupied by empty frames.
<P>
 So much for Duchamp's participation in Paris Dada.  It is also
the case that the New York avant-garde of the World War I years,
whose center was the Walter Arensberg circle, frequented by Duchamp,
Picabia, William Carlos Williams, Mardsden Hartley, Mina Loy,
and a score of others, was only retrospectively designated as
&quot;New York Dada.&quot;  And on closer inspection, Duchamp's
New York works do not belong to any of the generic Dada categories
discussed by Richter that are listed above.  He composed neither
simultaneous collaborative poems nor &quot;abstract&quot; phonetic
ones.  He wrote no manifestos,  produced no group exhibitions,
 did not make collages or photomontages from newspaper fragments
and everyday objects, as did the German Dadaists, or create abstract
&quot;unconscious&quot; compositions as did Arp.  As for <I>chance</I>,
Duchamp's concept of chance operations was by no means the &quot;chance&quot;
of random composition, but rather the careful use of rules that,
however &quot;chance-generated they may have been, once determined,
had to be followed.  And even the general category of Dada &quot;negation,&quot;
the rebellion against all established art forms and their discourses,
applies to Duchamp only superficially.  His was not, after all,
the &quot;negation&quot; of art as such that we find in Ball or
Huelsenbeck or Tzara:  As Thierry de Duve has noted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>[Duchamp] never wanted to burn down the museums as
did Marinetti or to break completely with art as did the Cabaret
Voltaire.  His 'Dadaism' was never made up of social condemnations
of art, but only of personal secessions.  He never wanted to engage
in a tabula rasa of tradition, nor did he believe that it was
possible to do so.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Indeed, Duchamp's own &quot;negation&quot; was never of art as
such but only of what he called <I>retinal art</I>, which
he rejected in favor of what a post-World War II generation would
call <I>conceptualism</I>.  Duchamp, I shall want to suggest
below, thus exceeds or bypasses Dada in any number of respects.
 At the same time--and this is the paradox--Dada will continue
to need Duchamp and perhaps vice-versa.
<BR><BR><BR>

<P>
 The case for Duchamp's Dada negation of &quot;art&quot; as bourgeois
construct  invariably cites the famous &quot;Apropos of 'Readymades',&quot;
 the talk Duchamp delivered at the Museum of Modern Art in October
1961 and frequently reprinted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> IN 1913  I HAD THE HAPPY IDEA TO FASTEN A BICYCLE
WHEEL TO A  KITCHEN STOOL AND WATCH IT TURN. . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> IN NEW YORK IN 1915 I BOUGHT AT A HARDWARE STORE
A SNOW SHOVEL ON WHICH I WROTE &quot;IN ADVANCE OF THE BROKEN
ARM.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> IT WAS AROUND THAT TIME THAT THE WORD &quot;READYMADE&quot;
CAME TO MIND TO DESIGNATE THIS FORM OF MANIFESTATION.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A POINT WHICH I WANT VERY MUCH TO ESTABLISH IS THAT
THE CHOICE OF THESE &quot;READYMADES&quot; WAS NEVER DICTATED
BY ESTHETIC DELECTATION.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> THIS CHOICE WAS BASED ON A REACTION OF VISUAL INDIFFERENCE
WITH AT THE SAME TIME A TOTAL ABSENCE OF GOOD OR BAD TASTE . .
. IN FACT A COMPLETE ANESTHESIA.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> ONE IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC WAS THE SHORT SENTENCE
WHICH I OCCASIONALLY INSCRIBED ON THE &quot;READYMADE.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> THAT SENTENCE INSTEAD OF DESCRIBING THE OBJECT LIKE
A TITLE WAS MEANT TO CARRY THE MIND OF THE SPECTATOR TOWARDS OTHER
REGIONS MORE VERBAL.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> SOMETIMES I WOULD ADD A GRAPHIC DETAIL OF PRESENTATION
WHICH IN ORDER TO SATISFY MY CRAVING FOR ALLITERATIONS, WOULD
BE CALLED &quot;READYMADE AIDED&quot;.  . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE &quot;READYMADE&quot; IS ITS
LACK OF UNIQUENESS . . . THE REPLICA OF A &quot;READYMADE&quot;
DELIVERING THE SAME MESSAGE; IN FACT NEARLY EVERY ONE OF THE &quot;READYMADES&quot;
EXISTING TODAY IS NOT AN ORIGINAL IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE. .
. . </FONT>
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=2>SINCE THE TUBES OF PAINT USED BY AN ARTIST ARE MANUFACTURED
AND READY-MADE PRODUCTS WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT ALL THE PAINTINGS
IN THE WORLD ARE &quot;READY-MADES AIDED&quot; AND ALSO WORKS
OF ASSEMBLAGE. <BR>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is the account of the <I>readymade</I> Duchamp put
forward In the last decade of his life, which is to say half a
century after the fact.   &quot;The choice of readymades,&quot;
Duchamp tells Pierre Cabanne at about the same time, &quot;is
always based on visual indifference and, at the same time, on
the total absence of good or bad taste&quot; (CAB 48).  As for
the first readymade, the <I>Bicycle Wheel</I>, assembled
two years before Duchamp so much as coined the term, he declared:
 &quot;When I put a bicycle wheel on a stool . . . there was no
idea of a 'readymade' or anything else.  It was just a distraction&quot;
(CAB 47).
<P>
 In keeping with these assertions, early critics of Dada regularly
repeated the disclaimer that, in Hans Richter's words, &quot;The
bottle-rack says 'Art is junk'.  The urinal says 'Art is a trick'&quot;
(HR 90).  Duchamp's readymades (as in readymade clothes), we have
been told again and again, were ordinary mass-produced, machine-made
objects, arbitrarily chosen by Duchamp with no consideration &quot;for
good or bad taste,&quot; and designated as &quot;art works&quot;
so as to debunk the very concept of individual art making.  &quot;Readymades,&quot;
writes Molly Nesbit in her catalogue essay for the Whitney <I>Dada
Invades New York</I> show, &quot;were not made to ever become
works of art.  They existed differently&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>Mounting the [bicycle] wheel on a stool, he left
the matter there.  The second readymade  came along the next year.
  It was an ordinary metal rack, the kind used to dry wine  bottles:
duchamp simply bought one at the great basement hardway display
in the Bazar  de l'H&ocirc;tel de Ville and brought it back home
to live quietly. . . . all the readymades were  first of all things,
his things, no more, no less.  (DINY 254-55).</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P>
 
<P>
 But how do &quot;his things&quot; become &quot;our&quot; things?
 Recent Duchamp scholarship  has begun to rethink the readymades
and to probe Duchamp's declarations of &quot;visual indifference&quot;
more carefully, especially since his statements are often contradictory.
  Duchamp tells Cabanne, for example, &quot;Before Courbet, painting
had other functions: it could be religious, philosophical, moral
. . . [but] our whole century is completely retinal, except for
the Surrealists, who tried to go outside it somewhat.  And still,
they didn't go very far!&quot; (CAB 43).
<P>
 Outside what?   Not, as is usually thought, outside &quot;art&quot;
as bourgeois construct but specifically outside the painting of
the previous century from Courbet to C&eacute;zanne, and especially
what Duchamp took to be the insistently (and exclusively) &quot;retinal&quot;
painting of the Impressionists.  &quot;Can one make works,&quot;
he remarked equivocally in his 1913 notes for the <I>Large
Glass</I>, &quot;which are not works of 'art'?&quot;   And
a year or so later, he speculated on the workings of language:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Grammar--i.e. How to connect the elementary
signs (like words), then the <I>groups</I> of signs one
to the other; what <I>will become of the ideas</I> of action
or of being (verbs), of modulation (adverbs)--etc.?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Buy a dictionary and cross out the words to be crossed
out.  Sign: revised and corrected.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Look through a dictionary and scratch out all the
&quot;undesirable&quot; words.  perhaps add a few--Sometimes replace
the scratched out words with another.  Use this dictionary for
the written part of the glass.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Dictionary--</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>with films, taken close up, of parts of very large
, obtain photographic records which no longer look like photographs
of something.  With these semi-microscopics constitute a dictionary
of which each film would be the representation of a group of words
in a sentence or separated so that this film would assume a new
significance or rather that the concentration on this film of
the sentences or words chosen would give a form of meaning to
this film. . . . </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>(1914; see SS 77-78).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 The search for a &quot;form of meaning&quot;:  it hardly sounds
like the fabled &quot;negation&quot; of art in favor of &quot;manifestation.&quot;
 &quot;I wanted,&quot; Duchamp once remarked, &quot;to grasp things
with the mind the way the penis is grasped by the vagina.&quot;
 The theme of &quot;grasping,&quot; as Linda Dalrymple Henderson
notes in her important study of the fourth dimension in modernist
aesthetic, is prevalent in Duchamp's notes for the <I>Large
Glass</I>.  For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Perspective<SUP>4</SUP>  will have a cube or 3 dim'l
medium as a starting point which will</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>not cause deformation i.e. in which the object<SUP>3</SUP>
is <I>seen circumhyperhypo-embraced (as if grasped with the
hand</I> and not seen with the eyes). </BLOCKQUOTE>  (SS 89)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Or again<BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> For a 4-dim'l individual, the 3-dim'l <I>tactile
grasp-image</I> (like a penknife in one's fist) </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> will differ when the (point? where the grasp? starts?)
moves 4-dimensionally.  (SS  93)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 The complex spatial possibilities suggested by a fourth dimension,
Henderson demonstrates, intrigued a whole range of artists in
the first decades of the century, among them the Cubists Albert
Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, the Russian avant-gardists Malevich
and El Lissitsky, and Duchamp's fellow experimenters Picabia and
Man Ray.  But what distinguishes Duchamp's speculations on hypercubes
and &quot;pseudo spheres&quot; (see SS 87) from those of his fellow
artists is that he wanted to relate the new <I>n</I>-dimensional
and non-Euclidean geometry to Renaissance concepts of perspective,
which, as Henderson notes, went directly counter to the basic
premises of Cubism: Apollinaire, for example, had dismissed perspective
in 1913 as &quot;that infaillible device for making all things
shrink,&quot; &quot;that miserable tricky perspective.&quot; 

<P>
  Calvin Tomkins tells us that in his mysterious Munich year (1912),
Duchamp interested himself, not, as might have been expected from
a French proto-Cubist, in Kandinsky or the <I>Blaue Reiter</I>
painters,  but in the Lucas Cranachs in the Alte Pinakothek (CTD
95).  On his return to Paris in November 1912, Duchamp took a
job at the Biblioth&egrave;que Sainte Genevi&egrave;ve, where
he combined the study of perspective with avid reading in Henri
Poincar&eacute;'s work on higher dimensions as well Esprit Pascal
Jouffret's <I>Trait&eacute; &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire de g&eacute;om&eacute;trie
&agrave; quatre dimensions</I> (1903).  <I>A L'Infinitif</I>
contains many notes like the following:

Referring to these and related notes in <I>A L'infinitif</I>,
Henderson comments:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> Duchamp's personal interest in shadows, mirrors,
and glass were all to receive additional encouragement through
his researches into traditional perspective.  The treatment of
shadows is customarily included in perspective treatises. . .
. Niceron's <I>Thaumaturgus Opticus</I> does include an
appendix on the conventional depiction of shadows . . . and <I>La
Perspective curieuse</I> deals extensively with <I>La catoptrique</I>,&quot;
the study of the optical effects of mirrors. . . . Finally, <I>La
Perspective curieuse</I> suggests the advantages of the use
of a glass panel in creating perspective, an idea dating back
to Leonardo and reiterated in many of the nineteenth-century perspective
treatises at Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(HEN 144-45).</FONT>
<P>
 Duchamp himself referred to these geometric experiments as &quot;Playful
Physics&quot; (no doubt an allusion to Alfred Jarry's pataphysics),
the quest for a &quot;<I>reality which would be possible by
slightly distending</I> the laws of physics and chemistry&quot;
(SS 49, 71).  Such &quot;playful physics&quot; found its culmination
in the use of glass and shadow effects in the Bride's Domain in
the <I>Large Glass</I> [Figure 13], where, according to
Duchamp, four-dimensionality could be simulated by painting a
&quot;Kind of milky way <I>flesh color</I> surrounding
unevenly densely the 3 Pistons (i.e. there will be a transparent
layer on the glass then the 3 Pistons then another layer of milky
way)&quot; (SS 36).  This representation of the &quot;desire motor,
consequence of the lubricious gearing&quot; (SS 39)  accords with
Duchamp's view that the sexual act was the pre-eminent fourth-dimensional
situation.
<P>
 But the immediate result of the researches carried on at Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve
was the piece called <I>Three Standard Stoppages</I> of
1913-1914 [Figure 14].  In &quot;The 1914 Box,&quot; we read:
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2> The <I>3 standard stoppages</I> are the meter

<P>
Here, notes Henderson, Duchamp unequivocally rejects Euclid's
assumption of the indeformability of figures in movement:  &quot;In
Duchamp's <I>Stoppages</I>, it is simply the movement of
a line (the thread) from one area of space to another, which illustrates
that geometrical figures do not necessarily retain their shape
when moved about, as Euclid and geometers for two thousand years
after him had assumed they would: (HEN 132).
<P>
 To examine the writings assembled in the <I>Green Box</I>
(1934) and <I>A l'Infinitif</I> [<I>The White Box</I>]
is to learn that far from producing an art of &quot;visual indifference&quot;
and &quot;total absence of good or bad taste,&quot; as Duchamp
later claimed, an artof &quot;Dada negation&quot; and the destruction
of &quot;bourgeois autonomy&quot; (B&uuml;rger's terms),  Duchamp
was, on the contrary, finding his own, very individual and idiosyncratic
way. And even in the early readymades, which are not usually linked
to Duchamp's mathematical speculations, he applied his observations
on the relation of line to circle, vanishing point to center.
<P>
 Consider that &quot;assisted readymade&quot; the <I>Bicycle
Wheel</I> [figure 1], which Duchamp had left, along with <I>Bottle
Rack</I> [figure 2] in his Paris studio [Figure 15], when
he sailed for New York in 1915, and which his sister Suzanne inadvertently
threw out with the trash so that we know both works only from
later reconstructions.<FONT SIZE=2>   </FONT><I>Bicycle Wheel</I><FONT SIZE=2>
 </FONT>was made by taking the wheel in question out of its normal
context and attaching it to an ordinary kitchen stool by mounting
its fork, upside down, in the hole at the stool's center.   Duchamp
referred to it as &quot;a pleasant gadget, pleasant for the movement
it gave.&quot;  He found it restful and comforting, he told Calvin
Tompkins, to turn the wheel and watch the spokes blur, become
invisible, then slowly reappear as it slowed down--the image of
a circle that turns endlessly on its own axis.  &quot;I enjoyed
looking at it, just as I enjoy looking at the flames dancing in
a fireplace.&quot;
<P>
 Dada joke?  Hardly, given the complex meanings of this &quot;pleasant
gadget.&quot;  First its eroticism: the fork of the large, vertical
and &quot;spinnable&quot; wheel is inserted into the hole of the
much smaller, stationery circle that sits horizontally on the
wooden stool.  But there are further implications.  In 1913, when
Duchamp was already working on drawings for the <I>Large Glass</I>,
 <I>Bicycle Wheel</I> testifies to the artist's interest
in what he was to call a &quot;delay,&quot; that is a type of
movement, not linear as in <I>Nude Descending a Staircase</I>,
but, as Jerrold Segal notes, &quot;suspended in a space it never
traverses.&quot;   &quot;The <I>Large Glass</I>,&quot;
writes Segal, &quot;contained . . . two objects whose action of
turning on an axis while going nowhere is echoed by the mounted
wheel--the chocolate grinder and the waterwheel [see Figure 16].
 The bicycle wheel, altered so that its circular movement no longer
produced linear progression, precisely captured Duchamp's shift
of interest from the first form of motion to the second&quot;
(JSPW 122).    The concept of &quot;delay&quot; is underscored
by a drawing Duchamp made in 1914 [Figure 17] called <I>Avoir
l'apprenti dans le soleil</I> (<I>To Have the Apprentice
in the Sun</I>).  Here the cyclist as high-wire  performer,
hunched over on his racing bike, rides a thread-like diagonal
line between musical staffs--a line that begins in a loop and
abruptly comes to an end near the upper right margin so that linear
progression is again suspended.  To &quot;have&quot; this particular
&quot;apprentice&quot; in the sun, as the title suggests, is thus
not to &quot;have&quot; him at all.
<P>
 In the same vein, the distinction of the obviously phallic bottle
rack is the absence of the bottles for which the prongs call out--again
a &quot;delay&quot; in which the male anatomy longs for --but
fails to attain-- physical contact with the female.  In the <I>Large
Glass</I>, this perpetual &quot;delay&quot; marks the space
between the bachelors in the lower half and the bride machine
above them.   In his notes for the <I>Green Box</I> [Figure
18], Duchamp writes:

<P>
Here and elsewhere, the  conceptual elaborations of a given set
of images are as complicated as in any of the journals of one
of Duchamp's favorite poets--Stephane Mallarm&eacute;.  Indeed,
the <I>fin de si&egrave;cle </I> looms large in Duchamp's
work, a readymade like <I>Bicycle Wheel</I> conjuring up--in
parody form, of course--the visual and verbal iconography of the
period.   Consider, for example,  the relationship of <I>Bicycle
Wheel</I> to those charming <I>bicyclettes</I> that
populate Marcel Proust's <I>A L'Ombre des jeunes filles en
fleurs</I>.   &quot;La petite bande&quot; of lovely young
girls (one of whom is Albertine, the narrator's future mistress)
are first viewed on the boardwalk at Balbec, wheeling their bicycles.
 Here, as in so many of the images of the period, the bicycle
is a symbol of freedom from conventional constraints, the subtext
being one of slightly illicit erotic activity, as engaged in by
&quot;advanced&quot; young women.  Duchamp could not have known
<I>A L'Ombre</I> (1918) when he made his readymade,  but
he was familiar with Proust's sources.  Take for example [Figure
19] this painting of bicycling fashions of the 1890s, reproduced
in Peter Quennell's <I>Marcel Proust</I>.  In the left
foreground, we have the three great demi-mondaines of the period,
Liane de Pougy, la Belle Ot&eacute;ro, and Cl&eacute;o de M&eacute;rode
on bicycles--displaying their daring and risqu&eacute; charm to
an admiring and elegant crowd in the Bois de Boulogne, with the
portico of the Chalet Du Cycle in the rear.   In another image---this
time a photograph, captioned &quot;Bicycling and walking dress,
at the beginning of the new century&quot; (PQ II 3), two young
women, standing beside their bikes, seem to be awaiting an assignation
[Figure 20].  And in a third, a painting by Jean B&eacute;raud
(Figure 21],  a sweet young thing, wearing bloomers, almost locks
wheels, so to speak, with the gentleman with whom she is evidently
about to take a ride through the Bois.  
<P>
 The bicycle as erotic instrument:  we meet it everywhere in the
paintings, photographs, and posters of the period.  Here [Figure
22] is Will Bradley's <I>Victor Bicycles (Boston Forbes)</I>,
a poster first published in <I>Les Maitres de l'Affiche</I>
(1899), in which a young man watches a young woman on a bicycle
out of the corner of his eye, the whole scene draped in flowers.
And here [Figure 23] is a Toulouse Lautrec poster from the 1890s
called <I>La Chaine Simpson</I>, in which the racing cyclist
shown in action behind his pace-makers is the then champion, Constant
Huret.  At the bottom left in block letters, we read L. B. SPOKE,
DIRECTEUR POUR LA FRANCE. 25 BOULEVARD HAUSSMANN.  The cyclist
as signifier of virility:  L. B. Spoke, I can't help thinking,
leads directly to R. Mutt.  But, then, as William A. Camfield
has demonstrated in a fascinating essay, Duchamp chose his urinal
from the J. L. Mott Iron Works with the greatest of care; his
<I>Fountain</I>, unlike some of the other available plumbing
items [Figure 24] allowed for intricate erotic play: the receptacle
for the male &quot;jet&quot; turned upside-down and made female,
a vagina potentially containing its own fluids.  Moreover, Duchamp
had Stieglitz photograph the urinal in front of Marsden Hartley's
<I>Warriors</I> [Figure 25] whose niche-like form (used
elsewhere by Hartley as a frame for a seated Buddha, [Figure 26])
nicely reenforces the form of his &quot;fountain&quot; (see RKFN
75-80).  That form, moreover, is not all that different--as parody,
of course--from the great Baroque fountains of Rome: Bernini's
<I>Bieccierone</I> (1660s) for example, with its giant
conch shell containing a fluted column, and some related extravantly
erotic jets [Figures 27-28].
<P>
 Surely Duchamp was familiar with engravings from the <I>Villa
d'Este</I>, from which these images come,  even as he grew
up with the bicycle images in <I>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</I>
photographs and art posters.  And surely, when he made <I>Bicycle
Wheel</I>, he must have understood that a further &quot;spin&quot;
could be achieved by detaching the big wheel, once and for all,
from the larger apparatus to which it belonged.   One of Duchamp's
first drawings, made in 1909 when he was twenty-three, was called
<I>Dimanches</I> <I>(Sundays</I>). [Figure 29].
 It shows a soberly dressed suburban couple, the husband pushing
a baby carriage, the wife heavily pregnant, the two, nowhere touching,
looking straight ahead with a glassy-eyed look of boredom or disgust.
 The object, it seems, was to remove one of those front wheels
of the pram and stick its rod into the hole of a not yet found
stool.  And in this sense, <I>Bicycle Wheel</I> takes its
place not only in the tradition of late nineteenth century illustration,
which it playfully debunks, but also in the chain of later conceptual
and assemblage art works of which it is surely a founding member.
 <I>Dust Breeding</I> (1920), Man Ray's photograph of the
<I>Large Glass, </I>as it looked when exposed to the dust
of the New York air [figure 30] is a case in point--a kind of
proto-earthwork. 
<BR><BR>
<B>Where Did All the Movements Go?<BR>

<P>
 The readymades thus present us with a Duchamp at once more traditional--and
paradoxically more postmodern--than one might suppose from the
usual &quot;avant-garde&quot; label.  The transformation of &quot;ordinary&quot;
objects by means of the &quot;playful physics&quot; of four-dimensionality,
the laws of Renaissance perspective, elaborate verbal punning,
and allusions to nineteenth-century photography and poster art,
gives Duchamp's readymades a signature uniquely their own.  Like
all &quot;great&quot; works of art they are inimitable.  And as
time goes on, we may expect the filiation between, say, Duchamp
and Man Ray, an artist who came of age as his declared disciple
and whose own &quot;objects&quot; could not have existed without
the example of the readymades,  to be overshadowed by a more stringent
reading of Duchamp vis-&agrave;-vis earlier as well as later artists
and poets. This, after all, is what it means to be &quot;avant-garde&quot;:
to reconfigure material from the past in so original a fashion
that later generations come to assess the culture itself through
the lens of a particular body of work.
<P>
 In a late  essay called &quot;The Creative Act,&quot; written
for a  roundtable held at the 1957 meeting of American Federation
of the Arts, where he shared the podium with Gregory Bateson,
Rudolf Arnheim, and William C. Seitz, Duchamp made the following
statement:
<P>
 <FONT SIZE=2>Let us consider two important factors, the two poles
of the creation of art: the artist on  the one hand, and on the
other the spectator who later becomes the posterity.</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> To all appearances, the artist acts like a mediumistic
being who, from the labyrinth beyond time and space, seeks his
way out to a clearing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> If we give the attributes of a medium to the artist,
we must then deny him the state of consciousness on the esthetic
plane about what he is doing or why he is doing it.  All his decisions
in the artistic execution of the work rest with pure intuition
and cannot be translated into a self-analysis, spoken or written,
or even thought out.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> T. S. Eliot, in his essay on &quot;Tradition and
the Individual Talent,&quot; writes:  &quot;The more perfect the
artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who
suffers and the mind which creates; the more perfectly will the
mind digest and transmute the passions which are its material.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Millions of artists create; only a few thousands
are discussed or accepted by the spectator and many less again
are consecrated by posterity.</BLOCKQUOTE>  (SS 138)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Duchamp citing T. S. Eliot?<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>Can he be serious?
 When, at the Nova Scotia colloquium &quot;The Definitively Unfinished
Marcel Duchamp&quot; (1987), Eric Cameron gave a paper called
&quot;Given,&quot; in which he invoked the Duchamp-Eliot connection,
Rosalind Krauss protested strenuously.  &quot;Eliot's conception
of tradition,&quot; she insists,  &quot;his idea of high culture,
his notion that art is redemptive, seems to me to be so far from
my understanding of Duchamp.  I just don't know where to look
in Duchamp to find anything that would connect to this.&quot;
 And further:  the connection of Duchamp to Eliot's concept of
the artist as medium and to &quot;larger systems of knowledge,
systems of an esoteric kind,&quot; is, Krauss argues, &quot;a
betrayal of Duchamp.&quot;
<P>
 But perhaps it is Duchamp who has &quot;betrayed&quot; his acolytes.
 Just at the stage of his career when he had become recognized
as the ultimate &quot;negator [of] the category of individual
production,&quot;  the mocker of &quot;all claims to individual
creativity,&quot; the debunker of &quot;the very principle of
art in bourgeois society&quot; (Peter B&uuml;rger's phrases),
Duchamp does an elegant turn-about and aligns himself with Eliot
in making a case for art as inspired mediumship.  &quot;In the
chain of reactions accompanying the creative act,&quot; says Duchamp,
&quot;a link is missing.  This gap which represents the inability
of the artist to express fully his intention; this difference
between what he intended to realize and did realize, is the personal
'art coefficient' contained in the work.  In other words, the
personal 'art coefficient' is like an arithmetical relation between
the unexpressed but intended and the unintentionally expressed&quot;
(SS 139).
<P>
 The much touted Dada negation of art as identifiable category
is here stood on its head by the very Dadaist whose name came
to represent the movement.  From the inception of the avant-garde
movements at the beginning of our century, this is the way the
movement ethos has played itself out.   Ezra Pound, who began
as an Imagist and Vorticist (movements he invented) soon came
to be linked with T. S. Eliot and James Joyce rather than with
F. S. Flint and Richard Aldington.   Roland Barthes, once regarded
as the Paris post-structuralist semiotician par excellence will
now have a Pl&eacute;iade edition devoted to his work--work now
characterized by its editors as passionately literary in the line
of Barthes's adored novelist, Marcel Proust.  And what about Gertrude
Stein, arguably the most radical writer of the Dada period, an
artist who, in part because of gender, belonged to none of the
Paris cenacles so prominent in her day?  If the avant-gardes are
always group formations, what sort of avant-gardist was Stein?
<P>
 Here Duchamp's aethetic is relevant.  In 1913, Stein wrote a
letter to Mabel Dodge in which she reported running into Duchamp,
who &quot;talked very urgently about the fourth dimension.&quot;
  Stein always wrote approvingly of Duchamp and it was he who
translated Stanza LXIX from her <I>Stanzas in Meditation</I>,
when the stanza appeared as a preface to a catalog of Picabia
drawings in 1932:
<P<BLOCKQUOTE>>
  <FONT SIZE=2>Be made to ask my name.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  If I think well of him be made to ask my name.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P>
And to &quot;ask her name&quot; is, as I have suggested elsewhere,
to learn how close a link there is between Duchamp's readymades
and Stein's verbal still-lifes and portraits.  Closer, most art
and literary historians would now agree, than the link between
Dada Duchamp and Dada Ball or Dada Tzara.
<P>
 It will no longer do, then, to talk of Dada as what Michel Sanouillet
calls a &quot;<I>bund</I>, whose purposes were identical,
and who had banded together their talents and energies to wage
an excruciating war against society as a whole.&quot;  At the
same time, we must not expect the current movement ethos to disappear.
 For in the mass industrialized societies of the twentieth century,
the artist almost invariably depends on a movement to gain initial
recognition. The Language movement in poetry, for example, gained
a great deal of mileage from its group activities--journals, manifestos,
anthologies, group readings --even though within a decade of its
first appearance, many of the minor figures had disappeared and
others like Susan Howe, Lyn Hejinian, Michael Palmer, and Charles
Bernstein had emerged as what we might call &quot;language plus'
poets--plus referring to their --forgive the unfashionable word--transcendence
of their specific group identity.
<P>
 Dada, we may conclude, will continue to need Duchamp, but the
time is coming when Duchamp will no longer need Dada.  &quot;The
existing order,&quot; to cite once again that elitist essay Rosalind
Krauss professes to despise, &quot;is complete before the new
work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty,
the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered.&quot;
 Or as Duchamp put it, &quot;In the last analysis, the artist
may shout from all the rooftops that he is a genius; he will have
to wait for the verdict of the spectator in order that his declarations
take a social value and that, finally, posterity includes him
in the primers of Art History&quot; (SS 138).
<P>
 Such reference to wholes, existing orders, completion, posterity,
and the primers of Art History makes us all nervous., Given our
current faith in cultural construction and in the &quot;death&quot;
or at least irrelevance of the author, we are likely to find the
movement ethos much more congenial than this genius talk.   After
some thirty years of Foucaultian author-functions, however, we
may now be witnessing the artist's revenge.  At the Houston roundtable
where Duchamp delivered his lecture on &quot;The Creative Act,&quot;
 he presented himself apologetically as a &quot;mere artist&quot;--no
match, it would seem, for the likes of Bateson and Arnheim.  Yet
it is the words of the <I>Marchand du sel</I> (Marcel Duchamp)
that have become famous.  As for the &quot;author-function,&quot;
Duchamp would no doubt have enjoyed being so designated, the 
author-function chiming so nicely with what he had designated
as the &quot;art coefficient.&quot;  A &quot;playful physics,&quot;
in any case, makes it all quite reasonable.

&quot;New York Dada&quot; discourse is the Whitney Museum's  exhibition
 <U>Making Mischief: Dada Invades New York</U>,  curated by Francis
M. Naumann (21 November 1996--23 February 1997).  Naumann's show
once again centers on Duchamp and, this time, his humor: Naumann's
lead essay is called &quot;New York Dada: Style with a Smile&quot;
(pp. 10-26).  For a useful review of this show, see Marcia E.

<font size=2> Ironically, such after-the-fact designation recurred
when, during World War II, the Surrealist emigres arrived in New
York, and Duchamp's association with Breton and Ernst soon earned
him the title of Surrealist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=2> The exception is Duchamp's installation for the
&quot;First Papers of Surrealism&quot; exhibition in at the Whitelaw
Reid Mansion in Mew York in 1942.  Duchamp covered walls, ceiling,
and floor of the gallery with white string, creating a labyrinthine
setting that was to become famous.  But this exhibition, which
had little to do with the Dada movement as such, was a way of
introducing Andr&eacute; Breton and other Surrealist war refugees
to the New York art world.  See Dickran Tashjian, <U>A Boatload

<font size=2>&quot;The word 'readymade,&quot; Duchamp tells Cabanne,
&quot;did not appear until 1915, when I went to the United States&quot;
(CAB 47).  Cf. Craig Adcock, &quot;Marcel Duchamp's Approach to
New York: 'Find an Inscription for the Woolworth Building as a
Ready-Made,&quot; NYDK, 52-53. Adcock takes the derivation to
be from &quot;ready-made&quot; clothing.&quot;  <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2> Molly Nesbit, relying on notes Walter Arensberg
evidently took from a conversation he had been having with Duchamp
on the bad taste exhibited by Leo and Gertrude Stein in their
choice of bibelots for their Paris house, observes that &quot;[Duchamp]
made fun of those, like Gertrude Stein, who loved their objects;
he did not love his&quot; (DINY 253).  But Stein's &quot;objects&quot;
are not the objets d'art on her mantelpiece but the ones she created
in <U>Tender Buttons</U> and other writings.   And these, as I
suggest in &quot;Of Objects and Readymades:  Gertrude Stein and
Marcel Duchamp,&quot; <U>Forum of Modern Language Studies</U>,
32, no. 2 (1996): 137-54, are very close to the readymades.<BR>
