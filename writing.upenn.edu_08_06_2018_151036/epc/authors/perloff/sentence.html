<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=+1 COLOR="#0000a6">When the O. J. Simpson verdict came in,</font> I wept. I was on the plane between
  Los Angeles and San Jose (my weekly run up to Stanford) when the pilot
  gave us the news. No one around me seemed to react. Maybe I took it so
  hard because I had followed the case so closely and was (or rather, am)
  convinced that there wasn't a doubt in the world that Simpson had committed
  the double murder. Maybe it was the immediacy of it all, given that I live
  a few minutes' drive from Rockingham Road, regularly drive down Bundy past
  the &quot;crime scene,&quot; and have dined a number of times at the now
  notorious Mezzaluna on San Vicente Blvd. Or maybe I cried because the trial
  and its discourses were such living proof of the debasement of language
  in <I>fin de si&egrave;cle</I> America. </P>
  <P>What's language got to do with it? What power is contained in such meter-making
  arguments as &quot;If it doesn't fit, you must acquit?&quot; Well, given
  that, as Vincent Bugliosi's devastating <I>Outrage</I> reminds us, the
  evidence against Simpson was absolutely overwhelming, the case may well
  have been &quot;lost,&quot; not primarily, as is the common wisdom, because
  the defense played the &quot;race card,&quot; or because &quot;a predominantly
  black jury won't convict a black defendant,&quot; but because the rhetoric
  of the trial--the packaged language games and misuse of simple sentences
  and propositions to which we were all treated by the judge, the attorneys
  for both sides, as well as by the scandal-driven media, stood in the way
  of any sort of reasoned analysis. </P>
  <P>Take the assumption that &quot;police brutality&quot; and &quot;police
  framing&quot; are equivalent, an assumption cynically put forward by the
  defense, never refuted by the prosecution, and quickly parrotted by the
  media. The former, as Bugliosi notes, is par for the course in the LA ghetto,
  where white policemen regularly harrass black citizens. Policy brutality
  is an outrage and it should be severely punished. But the latter, if we
  accept the Random House dictionary definition of &quot;framing&quot; as
  &quot;incriminating an <I>innocent</I> person through the use of false
  evidence, information, etc.&quot;, is extremely rare because it is extremely
  difficult and dangerous: if a police officer, much less a group of officers
  is found guilty of a frame-up, the death penalty is a real possibility.
  And, as <I>Outrage</I> demonstrates step by step, there was no way for
  even the despicable Mark Fuhrman to enlist the dozen other officers at
  the crime scene in the particular frame-up the LAPD ostensibly performed.
  Further: there is not a shred of evidence that a frame-up had occurred,
  the police having, on the contrary, covered up for Simpson The Celebrity
  for years. Indeed, the defense attorneys never dared to assert that Simpson
  actually <I>had been</I> framed. Insinuation was quite enough, the media
  soon referring sagely to &quot;the LAPD plot to incriminate Mr. Simpson,&quot;
  and so on. Thus, when Johnnie Cochran declared in his summation that the
  jury must return a &quot;Not-Guilty&quot; verdict so as to stop the Mark
  Fuhrmans of the world, with the fighting words, &quot;If you don't stop
  it, <I>then who</I>?&quot;, there was no objection from the media or from
  the public even though the question is utterly absurd. In what possible
  sense could the twelve jurors in question &quot;stop&quot; police brutality
  or racism in America by finding O. J. Simpson not guilty? The answer is
  that they had no such power at all. Indeed, a year after the trial, racism
  is probably more rather than less pervasive: witness the church burnings
  in the South and the new &quot;militias&quot; in Montana and Arizona. As
  Bugliosi remarks acidly, the real question the jurors should have been
  asked was &quot;If Mr. Simpson didn't commit these murders, <I>then who</I>?&quot;
  </P>
  <P>These are just small details in a complicated network of language crimes
  (another is the term &quot;dream team,&quot; invented by the media, perpetuated
  by one and all, and in fact, as Bugliosi shows, quite contrary to the facts)
  that characterized the Simpson trial. A word or phrase is used by an attorney
  (and the prosecution was by no means better than the defense in this regard),
  the media circus picks it up, the talking head slike Gerry Spence and Leslie
  Abrahmson comment sagely on it, and next thing you know, it is accepted
  as the truth without the slightest resort to logic or simple common sense.
  Thus the claim that &quot;It was probably the Columbia Drug Lords,&quot;
  was regularly heard by guests on <I>Larry King Live</I> and similar programs,
  without any consideration that it would be preposterous for Central American
  hit men (who almost always use guns) to stab their unknown victim (presumably
  Nicole Simpson) seven times and break her neck. In the context of the brutal
  butcherings (Goldman was stabbed thirty times on his scalp, face, neck,
  chest, abdomen, and left thigh), &quot;Columbia drug lords&quot; (or &quot;Columbia
  necklace&quot;) is no more than a linguistic chip, designating sleazy,
  dark, unknown people from &quot;down there,&quot; who must be the ones
  who kill &quot;our&quot; citizens &quot;up here.&quot;</P>
  <P>The &quot;trial of the century&quot; has been much on my mind in the
  course of reading the new books just published (I am writing in July 1966)
  by Susan Howe, Steve McCaffery, and Tom Raworth, all of them so-to-speak
  language poets <I>avant la lettre</I>, their first (small press or broadside)
  books dating back to the early seventies or, in Raworth's case, even earlier.
  Despite obvious differences as to gender, age (McCaffery is ten years younger
  than Howe and Raworth), nationality (Howe is Irish-American, Raworth, English;
  McCaffery English-born but a resident of Canada since 1968), and temperament,
  here are three poets who have assiduously tested the limits of language,
  foregrounding the materiality of writing rather than its communication
  of specific meanings. At the same time-- and here the poets in question
  differ from most of their younger followers-- all three write very much
  within the English (and in Howe's case American) literary tradition: at
  every turn, their poems echo, allude to, and parody earlier poetic models.
  But all three are also highly aware of living in a culture that has been
  reinvented by the electronic media, a culture in which language functions
  as the sort of tic we find in Johnnie Cochran's &quot;If you don't stop
  it, <I>then who</I>?&quot; Thus titles like <I>The </I>Cheat of Words (McCaffery),
  <I>Frame Structures</I> (Howe), and <I>Clean &amp; Well Lit </I>(Raworth).
  </P>
  <P><I>The Cheat of Words</I> carries on Steve McCaffery's ambitious project
  (its most recent installments were the long prose texts in <I>The Black
  Debt</I> [1989] and <I>Theory</I> <I>of Sediment </I>[1991]) to challenge
  what he has called &quot;fenestrational necessity, a mandate to linguistic
  transparency though which all beings and events [are] forced to pass,&quot;
  or again, a &quot;neutral ground of language&quot; as &quot;uninterrupting
  sediment of support and an un-differentiated surface upon which events
  are ordered.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="sentence_footnotes.html#1" TARGET="resource window">1</A>)</FONT> Such &quot;ordering,&quot;
  McCaffery would argue, is specious to begin with, given the inherent &quot;shiftiness&quot;
  of language and the refusal of meaningful phrases to take their appointed
  place inside a set of coherent structures, into monological messages like
  &quot;If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.&quot; Hence the poet's predilection
  for figures like the Deleuzian <I>rhizome</I> (the structure in which every
  node can be connected with every other node, allowing for the possibility
  of contradictory inferences) and the <I>Klein </I>worm--&quot;a form which
  differs from conventional geometric forms in its characteristic absence
  of both inner and outer surfaces&quot; (NI 20). </P>
  <P>The refusal of &quot;transparency&quot; is not just some form of willful
  obscurantism or rhetorical one-up-manship: &quot;the project,&quot; as
  Charles Bernstein puts it, &quot;is to wake us from the hypnosis of absorption.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="sentence_footnotes.html#2" TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</FONT> It is such hypnosis, after all,
  from which the prosecutors were evidently suffering when they made no more
  than a half-hearted effort to refute the defense's claim that the blood
  in the white Bronco may have been planted, even though Simpson himself
  had admitted, in his original taped deposition (see Appendix A in <I>Outrage</I>),
  that he &quot;dripped blood&quot; in his car, home, and driveway the night
  of the murder.<B> </B>To confront this hyper-absorption, in McCaffery's
  lexicon, is to produce a poetic response like &quot;Writing a Sand Thinking&quot;:<BR>
  </P>

					(The Cheat of Poetry, p.  31)</PRE>
  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <P>Writing in the sand is, of course, one of the oldest metaphors for erasure,
  for that which is forgotten or lost. McCaffery's title suggests that a
  lot of what passes for &quot;thinking&quot; is equally &quot;losable.&quot;
  In his fourteen-line poem, a pastiche sonnet in which no two lines are
  the same length, nothing &quot;rhymes&quot; with anything else, and enjambment
  is the rule, the only end-stopped line is the comically alliterating and
  portentuous opening, &quot;After the gossip one returns to grammar,&quot;
  which brings to mind Wallace Stevens's meditative lines, &quot;After the
  leaves have fallen, we return / To a plain sense of things.&quot; For McCaffery,
  there is never a &quot;plain sense of things.&quot; Gossip tries to get
  at what happened to whom, but its referentiality is by definition specious
  (i.e., &quot;it's only gossip&quot;), which is why Wittgenstein declared
  that &quot;All that is not gas is grammar.&quot; For grammar, the way sentences
  are actually constructed, is amenable to examination. Speech, by contrast
  &quot;compares us,&quot; which is dangerous, confusing &quot;rent[al]&quot;
  (borrowed words?) with ownership. And &quot;Pragma&quot; (the diminutive
  of &quot;pragmatics,&quot; in the sense of edicts, ordinances of state)
  try to define &quot;this as / the index of my slab.&quot; What slab? Is
  it the poet's index finger? The &quot;slab&quot; of <I>Philosophical Investigations</I>,
  where it functions in the most elementary of language games? However we
  characterize it, &quot;you&quot; &quot;slap at it.&quot; And why not, given
  all those shared phonemes: &quot;slab&quot;/ &quot;slap&quot;? Who &quot;owns&quot;
  these words, anyway?</P>
  <P>An &quot;aubade&quot; is a dawn song, usually expressing the lovers'
  regret that the night has passed so quickly and that they must separate.
  If it's cloudy, though, daylight may not yet be perceivable, and so &quot;The
  clouds pastiche aubade.&quot; Instead of impending separation, the &quot;adult
  formula&quot; for this Saturday morning prescribes mealtime. &quot;Sid's
  bakery delivers,&quot; providing &quot;symmetry&quot; to our lives and
  relegating sleep (poppies) to history. </P>
  <P>If I have indulged in a somewhat labored reading of what is a delightfully
  playful poem, it is in order to suggest that, contrary to the still dominant
  view that McCaffery's poems &quot;refuse to mean,&quot; on the contrary,
  this little &quot;fourteener&quot;--one of the slighter texts in this collection
  of thirty-nine poems-- has a great deal &quot;to say.&quot; It is written,
  to begin with, very much <I>in</I> a particular tradition: the metaphysical
  tradition of love sonnets and aubades, poems about our thought processes
  on the morning after the night before. But there is nothing &quot;personal&quot;
  or &quot;confessional&quot; here: no specifiers about the poet and his
  mistress, who may (or may not?) be present. No generalizations are being
  made about sex, marriage, or anything else because McCaffery is suggesting
  that one can't return to the &quot;plain sense of things,&quot; only to
  grammar, to how it works. The poem thus demands strong reader involvement:
  any number of plots will fit the &quot;adult formula&quot; of this sand-writing
  / thinking. And who knows what it is that &quot;Sid's bakery delivers&quot;?
  </P>
  <P>But why is such reader participation, such &quot;Conjectural and sediment
  to emendation&quot; (p. 43) necessary? Because it forces us to slow down
  and pay attention, to defamiliarize and hence call into question the way
  we normally process information:<BR>
  </P>
  <PRE>

	this record was recoded.    
				(&quot;Blue Note,&quot; p.  44)</PRE>
  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <P>Here McCaffery plays on such commonplaces as &quot;broadcast live from
  X&quot; (where the very act of broadcasting of course makes the performance-as-heard
  obviously <I>not</I> live), on &quot;long distance&quot; as ostensibly
  presenting us with &quot;live&quot; voices, despite the possibility of
  &quot;switch[ing] part[s]&quot; to produce the voices of the dead, and
  on the claim for the ethnographic authenticity of the generic &quot;village,&quot;
  even though here, as in more &quot;civilized&quot; settings, the record
  has been &quot;recoded,&quot; that is, tampered with. In this scheme of
  things:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>in the direction that erections take</P>
    <P>this one has become a false path (&quot;Learning Lenin,&quot; p. 56)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>and the proffering of alternatives has been reduced to phrases like
  &quot;Either <I>you</I> carve or it's <I>my</I> lamp&quot; (p. 57). This
  sentence comes from a poem called &quot;Discourse on Method,&quot; which
  is made up of one-line units, Descartes's <I>cogito</I> (&quot;I think
  therefore I am&quot;) gradually modulating, via lines like &quot;Lungs
  get repetitive&quot; and &quot;Break a neck,&quot; into &quot;I thought
  therefore I was,&quot; and then &quot;I think therefore I'll be.&quot;
  The mode is Wittgensteinian, a mere shift in tense or the substitution
  of a single word transforming a logical proposition into an absurd one.
  </P>
  <P>If McCaffery's unit is the single line, often the single word with space
  (silence) playing an active role, Tom Raworth's poetic mode is the opposite,
  his unpunctuated blocks of lightly stressed short lines speeding full steam
  ahead, as if to say that any word or phrase can belong with any other,
  provided they are incorporated in the same columnar block of text or pronounced
  in one long breath. Raworth has been using these columns for more than
  a decade now (especially in the long poem <I>Writing</I>, published by
  The Figures in 1982), they jet across our field of vision so swiftly and
  yet modestly that it takes a moment to realize how intricately planned
  they are. Take, for example, the first fourteen lines of &quot;Out of the
  Picture,&quot; the long narrative poem that opens <I>Clean &amp; Well Lit</I>:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>the obsolete ammunition depot</P>
    <P>unmissed and unreported</P>
    <P>put it in categories</P>
    <P>still glistened with dampness</P>
    <P>suits seemed to be identical</P>
    <P>through the window behind him</P>
    <P>a battered cardboard box</P>
    <P>won somewhere gambling</P>
    <P>dim bell in his memory</P>
    <P>was making a duplicate</P>
    <P>to see if that needed explanation</P>
    <P>sharply, and then, more gently</P>
    <P>the door opened</P>
    <P>three thousand miles east of home (p. 11)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I am arbitrarily braking after line 14 but there is no visual, aural,
  or semantic break in this 199-line ticker-tape text; the &quot;picture&quot;
  ( a film-script of sort that that seems to allude to war, science fiction,
  gangster exploits --you name it!) just coming into focus (&quot;now that
  he was aware of it&quot;) as it dissolves. For such an &quot;open&quot;
  text, however, &quot;Out of the Picture&quot; is highly structured both
  phonemically and syntactically. The predominant sound of these lightly
  stressed &quot;fast&quot; lines is a short vowel sound followed by the
  voiceless stop <I>t</I>, as in: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>the obsol<I>ete</I> ammu<I>nit</I>ion de<I>pot</I></P>
    <P>unmissed and unre<I>port</I>ed</P>
    <P><I>put</I> <I>it</I> in <I>cat</I>egories</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Seven instances in eleven words (although &quot;depot&quot; is eye rhyme
  rather than consonance), the light <I>t</I> continuing all the way down
  the page to the last line, &quot;<I>print</I>ed on them <I>suit</I>ed me,&quot;
  and then to the last line of the whole poem, &quot;now th<I>at</I> he was
  aware of <I>it</I>.&quot;</P>
  <P>Sound repetition (and there are many other patterns) is played off against
  what is an almost 100% rate of syntactic variation. Far from being merely
  random, in which case syntactic patterns would repeat, Raworth has arranged
  it so that no two lines in a row follow the same syntax. To exemplify briefly,
  the first fourteen lines above go like this:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Noun phrase with adjectival modifier</P>
    <P>past participles used as predicate adjectives</P>
    <P>imperative clause (or past indicative verb + adverbial compliment)</P>
    <P>past indicative verb + prepositional phrase</P>
    <P>complete clause (subject, verb, predicate) in past tense</P>
    <P>prepositional phrase modified by preopositional phrase</P>
    <P>noun phrase with adjectival modifier</P>
    <P>past indicate verb + present participle</P>
    <P>noun phrase + prepositional phrase</P>
    <P>past progressive verb + object</P>
    <P>infinitive + conditional clause</P>
    <P>adverb + qualifier + adverb</P>
    <P>complete clause (subject +predicate)</P>
    <P>adverbial phrase of time</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>No doubt, this chart will strike many readers as pedantic, but I hope
  it will show the ways sameness and difference operate in Raworth's verbal
  scheme. A lesser poet would follow &quot;the obsolete ammunition depot,&quot;
  with a series of similar noun phrases or would provide us with a continuous
  sentence, chopped into line lengths. Raworth's phrases, on the other hand,
  try to get &quot;at&quot; the substance of the poem from every possible
  angle--description, rumor, hearsay, narrative account, qualifier--even
  as what is missing throughout all this variability is the subject. Who
  or what &quot;still glistened with dampness,&quot; &quot;won somewhere
  gambling,&quot; &quot;was making a duplicate.&quot; Where is the &quot;obsolete
  ammunition depot&quot;; where is it that &quot;the door opened / three
  thousand miles east of home&quot;? What good does it do us to be given
  the specifier &quot;three thousand miles east&quot; when we don't know
  where &quot;home&quot; is? Is it possible to bring &quot;out&quot; what
  is &quot;in the picture&quot;? On the one hand, the writing is descriptive:
  something &quot;still glistened with dampness&quot;; &quot;a battered cardboard
  box&quot; seems to be visible &quot;through the window behind him&quot;
  (but who is &quot;him?), &quot;the door opened,&quot; and so on. But then
  there are the abstractions of &quot;put it in categories&quot; and &quot;to
  see if that needed explanation.&quot; And the observation that &quot;suits
  seemed to be identical&quot; is undercut by the lack of information we
  have as to those suits. Whose were they? And are they suits of clothing,
  suits of cards, or what?</P>
  <P>As we weigh one line against the other, however, an exciting tale seems
  to be emerging, rather like one of those tiny Japanese paper packets, put
  in water and taking shape as a flower. Is this <I>The Bridge on the River
  Kwai</I> or similar film? The &quot;ammunition depot&quot; might well be
  &quot;obsolete&quot; in time of peace; it is logical for it to be &quot;unmissed
  and unreported.&quot; But how to &quot;put it in categories? Perhaps inside
  the depot, the identical suits are found, &quot;still glisten[ing] with
  dampness.&quot; And there are further testimonials like the &quot;battered
  cardboard box / won somewhere gambling.&quot; Indeed, a &quot;dim bell
  in his [the poet's?] memory,&quot; was &quot;making a duplicate,&quot;
  which is to say, conjuring up the representation of the original to &quot;see
  if that needed explanation.&quot; But then &quot;gently / the door opened
  / three thousand miles east of home.&quot; Is this a reference to the past
  event narrated or to the present of the poet who rediscovers it? We cannot
  tell, but as the poem speeds ahead, more and more clues appear within the
  &quot;heavy coating of dust&quot; and &quot;panning over rough walls.&quot;
  For instance, there is reference to bombings and to the &quot;smell of
  wood burning,&quot; on &quot;costumed models / back in the car then / slumped
  down in the seat&quot;--the latter bringing to mind an Ed Kienholz assemblage.
  A taxi heads back &quot;to avoid hysterical screaming,&quot; a woman &quot;sob[s]
  / behind her veil,&quot; a guard is killed, a train &quot;makes an unscheduled
  stop,&quot; a &quot;mixture of standard tourists/ clustered around / the
  elegant camera bag / each holding a briefcase.&quot; And throughout, there
  are metapoetic references, as in &quot;camouflaged / against the cult of
  personality,&quot; &quot;he remembered the scene . . . slightly out of
  focus,&quot; and &quot;music wasn't music any more.&quot; </P>
  <P>&quot;Out of the Picture,&quot; like the later &quot;Coal Grass Blood
  Night Emerald&quot; (just consider the complicated relationships between
  those five nouns and their animal-vegetable-mineral references), is the
  perfect poem to read when you are tired of reportage and interviews with
  &quot;live&quot; celebrities or famed victims of one sort or another. If
  we can't get inside O.J.'s mind (as Chris Darden claimed to do in his opening
  statement about &quot;control&quot;), what a pleasure and challenge to
  enter the voyage realm of &quot;Out of the Picture,&quot; to be transported
  elsewhere, without a hectoring presence that tells us what to make of this
  or that detail. Partitions, mirrors, &quot;dimly lit / parking lot[s] /
  set well back from the road&quot;: the imagination is fired. When &quot;a
  train makes an unscheduled stop / he'd never heard before / suppressing
  an urge to look back for. . .&quot; the object of &quot;look back for &quot;
  turns out to be, quite inconsequentially, &quot;something to read.&quot;
  In the meantime, on every rereading, &quot;Out of the Picture&quot; yields
  new nuggets of meaning. In the course of the poem, those short little &quot;T-bar&quot;
  syllables like <I>jet</I> and <I>shot</I> come together, making us aware
  of the darkness they enmesh.</P>
  <P>If McCaffery's poetic unit is what the Russian Futurists called &quot;the
  word as such,&quot; and Raworth's might be characterized as the propulsion
  of non-stop verbal flow, Susan Howe's is more properly collage. &quot;Frame
  Structures,&quot; the title of her new book as well as of its thirty-page
  Preface, refers to the &quot;framing&quot; the poet has provided for her
  four earliest books, originally published as chapbooks or small press volumes.
  They are <I>Hinge Picture</I> (Telephone Books, 1974), <I>Chanting the
  Crystal Sea</I> (Fire Exit, 1975), <I>Secret </I>History of the Dividing
  Line (Telephone Books, 1978), and <I>Cabbage Gardens</I> (Fathom Press,
  1979) <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="sentence_footnotes.html#3" TARGET="resource window">3</A>)</FONT>. Between these four works
  and the present of <I>Frame </I>Structures, nearly twenty years have elapsed,
  recognition having come to Howe only gradually, beginning in the mid-eighties
  with the warm reception given to <I>My Emily Dickinson</I>. </P>
  <P>The early volumes remind us of that Howe started out as a visual artist.
  In <I>Hinge Picture</I>, for example, the epigraph comes from Duchamp's
  notes for the <I>Green Box</I>: &quot;Perhaps make a HINGE PICTURE. . .
  . develop in space the PRINCIPLE OF THE HINGE in the displacements 1st
  in the plane 2nd in space.&quot; That principle stands behind the sequence's
  visual layout: again and again, Howe discovers the paragrams within words
  by forcing her found texts (primarily from Edward Gibbon's <I>Decline and
  </I>Fall) into rectangular units with justified left and right margins.
  In #1, for example, &quot;intellect&quot; is broken up into &quot;intelle&quot;
  and &quot;ct,&quot; &quot;hieroglyph&quot; into &quot;h&quot; and &quot;ieroglyph,&quot;
  each letter thus receiving special attention. And in <I>Secret History
  of the Dividing Line</I>, the title (derived, minus the word &quot;Secret,&quot;
  from William Byrd's eighteenth-century journal of explorations in the Virginia
  wilderness) appears as a mirror image (see p. 94), even as the opening
  horizontal rectangles (again with justified left and right margins and
  double spacing) play on the word &quot;MARK&quot;:<BR>

  <P>Here <I>mark</I> refers first of all to the surveyor's (William Byrd's)
  mark made in delineating a boundary between &quot;tract[s]&quot; of forest
  land. But the mark is also a trace, a sign that points us to specific things
  that have happened: one thinks of Blake's &quot;London,&quot; with its
  lines, &quot;And mark in every face I meet / Marks of weakness, marks of
  woe.&quot; The poem's opening &quot;Mark mar ha forest 1 a boundary manic&quot;
  treats the word &quot;mark&quot; to its paragrammatic possibilities: &quot;mar
  ha&quot; may be separate words, referring to destruction and the exclamation
  of surprise, but then again, the two units may be part of the name &quot;Martha,&quot;
  the &quot;t&quot; missing in the imagined source manuscript Here and throughout
  the text, &quot;boundary manic&quot; is central to the poet's thought;
  she is mesmerized by questions of &quot;secret&quot; divisions, borders,
  boundaries, fault lines. &quot;MARK,&quot; we read on p. 90, &quot;border
  / bulwark, an object set up to indicate a boundary or position / hence
  a sign or token / impression or trace / The Horizon.&quot; Then, too, Mark&quot;
  refers both to Howe's father (Mark de Wolfe Howe) and to her son, as the
  dedication on page 91 tells us. Indeed, the frontispiece informs us that
  Mark DeWolfe Howe's <I>Touched With Fire</I>: <I>The</I> <I>Civil War Letters
  and Diary of Oliver Wendell Holmes</I> (Harvard University Press, 1947)
  is the poem's primary source.</P>
  <P>But--and this is what makes <I>Frame Structures</I> so intriguing--within
  the configuration of the new preface, the <I>mark-ing</I> or trace structure
  of <I>Secret </I>History of the Dividing Line, far from being incorporated
  into the larger frame of the new book, are always qualifying and transforming
  statements made in the prose memoir. Indeed, there is no external &quot;frame,&quot;
  no outside to contain the inside of the poems. Howe's autobiographical
  memoir begins as a kind of feminist variant of Robert Lowell's &quot;91
  Revere St.&quot;--a portrait of the artist as New England blue-blood, neurotic
  child. &quot;On Sunday, December 7, 1941,&quot; we read, &quot;I went with
  my father to the zoo in Delaware Park&quot; (p. 3). The father, who is
  about to go to war, is not named and unlike Lowell, Howe does not give
  us a continuous narrative about persons and places. Rather, she shifts
  in the very next section to Colonial American history, specifically to
  the 1792 purchase by the Holland Land Company of the &quot;wild lands&quot;
  in central and western parts of New York and Pennsylvania. The references
  to the &quot;land speculators, surveyors, promoters, publicists,&quot;
  who settled in upper western New York State and founded the city of Buffalo,
  where Howe was born (and where she is once again living as a professor
  at SUNY) are spliced into the &quot;secret history&quot; of William Byrd's
  explorations in Virginia a century earlier, the two narratives overlapping
  as parts of the larger tale of boundary-making, acquisitiveness, plunder,
  and war that characterized the newly formed &quot;United States&quot; for
  its inception.</P>
  <P>But Howe never says this directly. Indeed her Preface provides no overt
  background material about the four early books reprinted by New Directions,
  the conditions under which they were written, how they were conceived,
  and so on. For such information, we may go to the Howe interviews in <I>The
  </I>Difficulties (1989) and <I>Talisman </I>(1992). In <I>Frame Structures</I>,
  the &quot;evidence&quot; for the poetry is accumulated obliquely and indirectly,
  the unnamed &quot;my father&quot; of Howe's opening pages--the &quot;Daddy&quot;
  who went away to war-- only emerging as Mark DeWolfe Howe half-way through
  the narrative, where he reappears as one of Felix Frankfurter's disciplies
  at Harvard Law School and later his and Dean Ernest Griswold's choice to
  produce the edition of Oliver Wendell Holmes's letters and diary that became
  Susan Howe's source in <I>Secret History </I>of the Dividing Line. We now
  learn that the sequel to this book, <I>Touched with </I>Fire, was called
  <I>The Proving Years</I> (1963), and that its first chapter is titled &quot;'The
  Stars and the Plough' probably because that's the title of <I>The Plough
  </I>and the Stars. Sean O'Casey's play about the Easter Rising, named for
  the symbol on the flag of the Irish citizen army, is one of my mother's
  favorites. The stars are the ideal the plough reality. I guess my father
  meant to put reality first&quot; (p. 17).</P>
  <P>The anecdote nicely embodies the poet's heritage as she perceives it:
  the idealistic radicalism she derived from her Irish actress mother, Mary
  Manning, vis-&agrave;-vis the more tempered, scholarly historical imagination
  of her father Mark. But instead of now moving ahead chronologically, as
  would most autobiographers, Howe goes back in time, to her paternal grandfather,
  the antiquarian, Mark Antony DeWolfe Howe, her great-grandfather by the
  same name who was a distinguished Episcopal Bishop, and, beyond these two
  Mark Antonys, to the early d'Wolf (the original name) and Howe ancestors
  who were &quot;generally sea captains, privateers, slave traders,&quot;
  one having fought in King Philip's War, another, James d'Wolf, evidently
  having thrown &quot;a female African slave overboard during the Middle
  Passage because she was sick with smallpox.&quot; &quot;When this murderous
  ancestor could finally afford to buy his own slave ship, he christened
  her <I>Sukey</I>. Sukey is my nickname&quot; (pp. 20-21).</P>
  <P>How does the late twentieth-century radical woman poet deal with these
  events in her distant and not-so-distant past? &quot;Space,&quot; the narrator
  remarks at one point, &quot;is a frame we map ourselves in&quot; (p. 9).
  At certain junctures, and especially toward the end of &quot;Frame Structures,&quot;
  the formal narrative begins to break down. The poet as surveyor-excavator,
  working &quot;where logic and mathematics meet the materials of art. Canvas,
  paper, pencil, color, frame, title,&quot; refigures a page from Benjamin
  Franklin's <I>Memoirs</I> (p. 27), lines running into one another and produced
  as overprint, the technique Steve McCaffery discusses so interestingly
  in his essay on Bill Bissett in <I>North of </I>Intention. &quot;The essential
  part of any invention,&quot; we read on Howe's penultimate page, &quot;is
  distance and connectness. We pass each other pieces of paper. A sheet of
  paper, a roll of film, the frame structure. Conceptual projects of the
  1960s and 1970s combined windows, mirrors, garbage, photographs, video,
  dance, tape recordings, rope, steel, yarn, nails, cars, machines, just
  about anything.&quot; (p. 28). Just so, when we now turn back to <I>Secret
  History of the Dividing Line</I>, individual passages emerge as &quot;overprinted&quot;
  with new significations, as in the case of the 26-line word column on p.
  119, at the center of which we find</P>

  <P>How can we tell the framing from the framed? In the &quot;Cinder of
  the lexical drift&quot; which is the &quot;secret history&quot; of &quot;Frame
  Structures,&quot; every &quot;dividing line&quot; is submitted to further
  development and variation. This, the poet implies, is how &quot;evidence&quot;
  should actually be weighed and tested. For no frame can account for all
  the pieces in the puzzle (&quot;it is hard to know where to begin,&quot;
  as we read on the last page of Howe's Preface), but the text's intricate
  interplay, its metonymic network of <I>marks</I> and traces, calls into
  question such discourses as that of the postmodern courtroom, as well as
  of the verbal world that mediates it for us. &quot;If it doesn't fit /
  you must acquit&quot;: can the &quot;fit&quot; game Simpson put on for
  the jury really function as such an isolated instance? And where is the
  &quot;dividing line&quot; between &quot;may&quot; and &quot;must&quot;?
  </P>
  <P>In an interview with Clint Burnham, McCaffery makes a case against the
  hackneyed designation of radical poetries as being &quot;experimental&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Experimental suggests (perhaps implies) a scientific model and an enterprise
    based on trial and error. This metaphoric implication further allows the
    disvalidation of works as &quot;having failed.&quot; But trial, error,
    failure and success are totally inappropriate to these cultural productions.
    A better term might be &quot;exploratory&quot; evoking a spatial rather
    than scientific metaphor. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="sentence_footnotes.html#4" TARGET="resource window">4</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>That spatial metaphor also animates Raworth's vertical word columns
  and Howe's &quot;frame structures.&quot; The &quot;displacements&quot;
  of the Duchampian &quot;hinge picture,&quot; &quot;1st in the plane 2d
  in space,&quot; force us to rethink those facile buzzwords and clich&eacute;s
  that permeate the culture. To put it in the context of Simpson-speak, if
  it doesn't fit, explore the hand inside the glove, and see what that cut
  on the middle finger may tell you.</P>
