<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=+1 COLOR="#0000a6">Parker Tyler's long poem</font> <I>The Granite Butterfly</I> was published
  in the late autumn of 1945. On 29 December, William Carlos Williams wrote
  excitedly to Tyler: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>I just now, 9.15 p.m., finished reading <I>The Granite Butterfly</I>.
    It is absorbingly interesting quite apart from being a pleasurable work
    of art and quite definitely an important work of art in addition to its
    being thoughtfully interesting. I'm trying to be accurate. As far as I
    know it's the best poem--far and away the best poem you have ever done.
    . . . I think the finest poem--in some parts--of our time. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="parker_footnotes.html#1" TARGET="resource window">1</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>And lest we think these are just the kind words of one established poet
  for a less well-known poet friend, Williams wrote a review of <I>The Granite
  Butterfly</I> for <I>Accent</I>, in which he declared Tyler's poem to be
  &quot;the best poem written by an American since <I>The Waste Land</I>--
  certainly by far the best long poem of our day.&quot; As for Tyler's metrics,
  &quot;This verse,&quot; we read, &quot;is much more modern than Pound['s].&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="parker_footnotes.html#2" TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</FONT> At the same time, Williams recommended
  <I>The Granite Butterfly</I> to Pound himself with the comment, &quot;I
  have called the poem the best long poem produced in America since the disaster
  of Eliot's Waste. . . . Tyler resumes where our investigations were stopped
  by that piece of vaginal stop-gap&quot; (GB 133).</P>
  <P>Strong words, these, even for Williams, who, as James E. B. Breslin
  reminds us in his Introduction to Williams's writings on younger poets,
  was often &quot;too lax in dispensing his support, as if he were a wayward
  bishop willing to confirm anyone able to stumble to the altar&quot; (SS
  25). But whereas few critics shared Williams's indiscriminate enthusiasm
  for, say, Eli Siegel or Marcia Nardi, Tyler did have the support of as
  fastidious a Leavisite critic as Marius Bewley as well as of the oppositional
  Kenneth Burke. At the very least, then, Charles Boultenhouse and Michael
  Fournier's fascinating new facsimile edition of <I>The Granite Butterfly</I>
  provides us with an important chapter in taste-making, a set of documents
  (reviews, correspondence, drafts, illustrations) that can help us to understand
  how and why a poem that has since fallen into such total obscurity, was
  once hailed as a masterpiece. </P>
  <P>Who <I>was</I> Parker Tyler? He was born in New Orleans in 1904, moved
  to Chicago as a child and attended the Chicago Latin School. At eighteen
  he left school and joined the Cleveland Playhouse; at twenty-two, he moved
  to New York and was soon part of its avant-garde literary scene. Little
  magazine editor (first of <I>Blues</I>, with Charles Henri Ford, later
  of <I>View</I>), he was also a gifted film critic (see <I>The Hollywood
  Hallucination</I> and <I>Magic and Myth of the Movies</I>), art critic
  (he wrote important pieces on Joseph Cornell), biographer (of Pavel Tchelitschew),
  and a minor poet. Williams' contact with Tyler is chronicled by Mike Weaver,
  who describes the poet's keen interest, at the point when he was organizing
  the manuscripts of <I>Paterson</I>, in the January 1943 issue of <I>View</I>
  devoted to &quot;Americana Fantastica,&quot; which Tyler had edited. The
  front and back cover of the issue were made up of a single collage of Joseph
  Cornell's, a collage that juxtaposes images of Indians with extravagant
  feathered headdress, athletes riding Niagara Falls, circus acrobats, skyscrapers,
  and an ape on a tall pedestal, holding an airplane in his fist-- fantasy
  collocations that anticipate the juxtapositions of <I>Paterson</I>. <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="parker_footnotes.html#3" TARGET="resource window">3</A>)</FONT> In keeping with Cornell's collage,
  Tyler proclaimed that &quot;the real Constitution of a romantic State&quot;
  depended on the fantastic, fantasy being &quot;the Anti-camouflage, the
  enemy of self-effacement,&quot; and the &quot;total negation of deceit&quot;
  (MW 129). The fantastic, in its turn, was, for Tyler, synonymous with the
  monstrous, which he documented with relish in <I>View</I>, much to the
  dismay of the war refugee artists from Europe as well as American poets
  like Kenneth Rexroth and Robert Duncan (see MW 129-30). But Williams found
  Tyler's definition of the fantastic in art as &quot;the city of the irrational
  . . . the irrational plus architecture,&quot; stimulating, and shared Tyler's
  taste for the painting of Tchelitchew, longing to &quot;americanize&quot;
  what he and Tyler took to be the latter's Surrealist fantasies (see MW
  135-42).</P>
  <P>But--and this is where <I>The Granite Butterfly</I> comes in-- Williams's
  understanding of Surrealism, like Tyler's own, was oddly skewed. Tyler
  defined Surrealism dialectically: &quot;Surrealism combines in practice
  the representational value of the image (imagism) and the symbolic value
  of the image (symbolism) in a sort of dialectical play of values.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="parker_footnotes.html#4" TARGET="resource window">4</A>)</FONT> But such &quot;dialectic&quot;
  (between the literal and the symbolic) is almost diametrically opposed
  to Andr&eacute; Breton's originary definition of Surrealism as &quot;pure
  psychic automatism, by which an attempt is made to express, either verbally
  in writing or in any other manner, the true functioning of thought.&quot;
  &quot;Surrealism,&quot; for Breton and his cenacle, &quot;rests on the
  belief in the higher reality of certain hitherto neglected forms of association,
  in the omnipotence of the dream, in the disinterested play of thought.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="parker_footnotes.html#5" TARGET="resource window">5</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>In practice, what this meant is that surrealist poems were to be impervious
  to logical explanation, much less &quot;translation&quot; into &quot;normal&quot;
  discourse. In Tyler's &quot;surrealism,&quot; on the other hand, explanation
  and interpretation were <I>de rigueur</I>. Consider, for example, his &quot;Author's
  Note on the Meaning of the Poem,&quot; originally designed to be published
  with the poem and reproduced in the facsimile edition. Proudly proclaiming
  that his poem does not rely on external sources like <I>The Waste Land</I>,
  Tyler notes that &quot;All its sources are in the poem itself&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>These sources are simply a triple set of situations: first, the original
    situation of the poet's intuitively incestuous relations with his parents;
    second, the hallucinated situation of the negro boy's invasion of the country
    home of the movie actor and his mistress; third, the situation dreamed
    by the actor's mistress, based on the plot of a movie proposed for the
    actor, in which a noble Russian family is ruined by a revolution, the son
    being killed, and the father raped in the same manner as the man in the
    second situation. (GB 67)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>And further:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The negro boy is obviously the son excluded from the sexual ecstasies
    of his parents; the fact that he is black signifies not only a socially
    inevitable type of inferiority, but the fact that his primary nature is
    secret, associated with both obscurity and the night. (GB 68)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This sounds a good deal more like Brooks &amp; Warren's <I>Understanding
  Poetry</I> than like anything Breton or Desnos or Aragon would have written.
  Indeed, forties &quot;modernism&quot; in the U.S. --the modernism of Maxwell
  Anderson and the late Eugene O'Neill, of Tennessee Williams's <I>Glass
  Menagerie</I> (first performed in 1945, the year of <I>Granite Butterfly</I>),
  of Delmore Schwartz and Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom and the Robert Lowell
  of <I>Lord Weary's Castle</I> (1946) --had much less in common with Surrealism
  (or indeed with any of the great &quot;modernist&quot; innovations of the
  teens and twenties)-- than with Symbolism, but a symbolism that, unlike
  Mallarm&eacute;'s or Eliot's or Stevens's, is largely reductive in its
  one-to-one equivalencies. &quot;The negro boy is obviously the son excluded
  from the sexual ecstasies of his parents,&quot; &quot;the son is a homosexual
  Oedipus&quot; (GB 68), and, as for the title, the &quot;poet's soul&quot;
  is a &quot;butterfly, something beautiful and extremely frail,&quot; that
  is nevertheless &quot;locked in the sublime catastrophe&quot; of the Oedipal
  myth and hence &quot;is one with a perduring substance. It is granite.&quot;
  Indeed, &quot;its interposition is not altogether artless, for as a symbol
  of the poet-spectator who is scrutinizing the secret of the pyramid, the
  angle of its wings coincides with the sides of an inverted pyramid and
  with the lifted legs of the supine male&quot; (GB 71).</P>
  <P>Again and again, Tyler explains himself in this manner. Writing to Kenneth
  Burke on 19 July 1946, he notes the &quot;'inversion' of substituting the
  father-image for the mother-image in the poet's oedipal impulse [which]
  embodies in the oedipus-personality of the poet-son the antagonistic attributes
  of the chief gods of the Hindu triad, Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva, who have
  both destructive and creative faculties&quot; (GB 120). Or again, &quot;The
  poem's image of the 'furious mother' (frustrated by her mate's passivity
  and the sexually ambiguous nature of her son) as the Medusa, coincides
  with the stone phallus-butterfly as the 'child' of her glance&quot; (GB
  121). Every word, every image, every narrative thread, it seems, points
  to something <I>else</I>, exists only to point to that <I>other</I>. And
  in these pre-Deconstructionist days, there is no question, at least not
  in Tyler's mind, but that poetic signifiers exist in order to point to
  the signifieds behind them.</P>
  <P>Why would this &quot;deep symbolist&quot; aesthetic have appealed to
  Williams, who had recently declared, in &quot;Against the Weather: A Study
  of the Artist&quot; (1939), &quot;No symbolism is acceptable. No symbolism
  can be permitted to obscure the real purpose, to lift the world of the
  senses to the level of the imagination and so give it new currency&quot;
  (SE 213)? The Williams who wrote in 1944 in his &quot;Author's Introduction&quot;
  to <I>The Wedge</I> that &quot;A poem is a small (or large) machine made
  of words,&quot; and two years later in <I>Paterson</I>, &quot;No ideas
  but in things&quot;? What, to put it plainly, could and did Williams see
  in Tyler's long poem? This is the intriguing puzzle the reader of <I>Granite
  Butterfly</I> faces.</P>
  <P>In his excellent introduction to the facsimile edition, Tyler's long-time
  companion Charles Boultenhouse recalls that Williams especially admired
  the poem's &quot;music.&quot; &quot;The distinctive quality of Parker Tyler's
  measure,&quot; he writes, &quot;the personal rhythm that prolongs and smooths
  the syllables of <I>The Granite Butterfly</I>, is caused, technically,
  by a subtle counterpoint of traditional iambic and falling sprung rhythm.
  This special tension between a temporal and stress prosody&quot; gives
  the poem &quot;a slowness of pace that permits the deepest flow of blood
  and being to be heard&quot; (GB xii). Here Boultenhouse seems to be following
  Tyler's own lead: in 1964, a year after Williams's death, Tyler prepared
  a complete scansion and metrical analysis of <I>the Granite Butterfly</I>
  in the form of a musical score (see GB 91-92 and unnumbered figure 8).
  But he had, for that matter, already praised his own prosodic innovations
  in a number of pieces, for example the review he wrote of his own poem,
  under the pseudonym Everett McManus, for the <I>Chicago Review.</I>  <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="parker_footnotes.html#6" TARGET="resource window">6</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>How does this &quot;subtle counterpoint&quot; of iambic and sprung rhythm
  actually work? Here is the opening passage of the First Canto (GB 9):</P>
  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <PRE>
		The mother,  first in the birth pangs
		Blinded with being
		Crushes her lashes together
                        shutting out
		All but the in

			 And

		In her: the poet
		Sharing her blindess, her agony, her
		Being . . .</PRE>
  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <P>In my own scansion (which the reader may compare to Tyler's own), this
  is a fairly reductive version of Poundian &quot;free verse&quot;--a verse
  largely formed, as many scholars have noted, on Greek rhythms. The first
  line has an amphibrach (&quot;The m&oacute;ther&quot;) followed by a dactyl
  and spondee; the second, a dactyl followed by an amphibrach, the third
  repeats that pattern somewhat monotonously (despite the consonance of &quot;Cru<I>shes</I>&quot;/
  &quot;la<I>shes</I>&quot;), and adds a second amphibrach (&quot;tog&eacute;ther&quot;),
  the fourth has a trochee plus an iamb, the fifth an isolated stressed syllable,
  and so on. There is nothing very arresting about Tyler's line breaks or
  caesurae (&quot;In h&eacute;r // the p&oacute;et&quot;) and, all in all,
  it would seem that this is no more than conventional mid-century free verse,
  marked by slow rhythms and a good deal of repetition, as in the anaphoric
  opening of Canto 7:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Slow as the first long look of love</P>
    <P>Slow as the last look</P>
    <P>Slow as the music of a sigh</P>
    <P>Slow as the moment after goodbye. . . . (GB 36)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Boultenhouse calls this canto &quot;a brilliant invention . . . unique
  in all poetry. One might possibly argue that it is Homer's catalogue of
  the ships altered into another catalogue altogether: a list of metaphors
  of slowness&quot; (GB xxiv). But to a reader of the nineties, a reader
  familiar with the rhythms of, say, Olson, Duncan, and Spicer, one longs
  for some sort of thickening of the plot.</P>
  <P>Why, then, would Williams, one of the great free verse prosodists of
  the century, admire <I>The Granite</I> <I>Butterfly</I> so enthusiastically?
  I shall return to this question in a moment, but I want first to look at
  the actual plot of this long poem, originally titled <I>A Story Must be
  Told</I>. That &quot;story&quot; is the poet's own; the nine cantos (nine
  symbolizes the nine months from conception to parturition) chronicle the
  Oedipal family drama of a sensitive young gay man from birth to the rite
  of passage wherein he is reborn a poet. Here is a quick synopsis of the
  cantos:</P>
  <P>1. &quot;The Birth of Art.&quot; Opens with a birth scene in which the
  mother's delivery doubles as the <I>couvade</I> (the simulation of giving
  birth by the father) of the future poet.</P>
  <P>2. &quot;The Name.&quot; The young poet's obsession with an unnamed
  movie star (who is, as Boultenhouse tells us, the silent screen star Carlyle
  Blackwell). </P>
  <P>3. &quot;Boredom.&quot; A three-act playlet in which three short dialogue
  interludes are punctuated by the poet's soliloquy, providing a glamorous
  evocation of his parents as movie stars on vacation in an idyllic landscape.</P>
  <P>4. &quot;Portrait.&quot; A dream sequence in which Perseus-Tyler dares
  to turn away from the dreaded face of his Medusa-mother and, in the person
  of Narcissus (the symbol of his inversion) reinvoke his beloved film star.
  </P>
  <P>5. &quot;Metamorphosis.&quot; Evokes the poet's recognition that his
  obsession with Blackwell is a &quot;Verifiable complex,&quot; a disease.
  The background of this complex is a long Freudian dream sequence, in which
  the poet's mother, father, Narcissus, birth, and childhood come together
  in a new understanding of his mother's masculine and father's feminine
  qualities.</P>
  <P>6. &quot;Black Oedipus.&quot; The poet appears a a black rapist, in
  a fantasy in which he rapes his father in front of his mother.</P>
  <P>7. &quot;Slow As.&quot; The moment of metamorphosis and poem's crescendo,
  in which we witness the poet's ritual <I>couvade</I> of being born and
  giving birth, his exorcism of Carlyle Blackwell as personal <I>Dybbuk</I>,
  and the self-therapy which brings on poetic healing: &quot;Suddenly / The
  pyramid disappears from around its heart / leaving the heart there on the
  desert sand, / black and white hieroglyph&quot; (GB 39).</P>
  <P>8. &quot;Narcissus.&quot; The poet of reflections, of mirrored images
  now emerges as Narcissus, able to restore the image of true poetic power,
  which he has wrested from his family drama.</P>
  <P>9. &quot;The Story.&quot; A blank verse narrative of a movie scenario
  set during the Russian Revolution, a scenario replete with star-crossed
  lovers, rebelling serfs, and violent struggle, which contains echoes and
  allusions to everything that has gone before. The narrative simulates the
  texture and movement of film; at its conclusion the Russian tale merges
  with the poet's address to his Mother Medusa, in which Perseus-Narcissus
  announces his initiation into poetry.</P>
  <P>We can see from this synopsis that <I>The Granite Butterfly</I> has
  more in common with, say, O'Neill's similarly Freudian-mythological <I>Strange
  </I>Interlude and <I>Mourning Becomes Electra</I> than with <I>Paterson</I>,
  let alone Pound's <I>Cantos</I>. Its symbolism is heavy-handed and murky,
  Black Oedipus-Perseus-Narcissus never quite emerging as a credible human
  being. As for Tyler's language, it remains largely inert on the page. Canto
  2, for example, begins with the line &quot;From this name take off, this
  platform of love,&quot; followed by a rectangular box containing two units
  of seven and nine x's respectively, x's which, Boultenhouse tells us, stand
  for Carlyle Blackwell. Below this coy device, we read:</P>
  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <PRE>
		Secret name of the father
                               Name of another
		Whole mask of the father
                                In another whole being
		So he be not hated  
	                                      but loved
			       
			       Breaths of being, mould!
					
					Not abbreviation
		Nor all the sleepy grammars of this earth
		Shall comma me to such deep drowse that I
		Know not the sounded speech, the waking word
		As, in the subway, things go back
		To their beginnings, the mind
		Escaping from the sound, the seated crowd,
		Going back to an old love. . . .  (GB 13-14)</PRE>
  <P><BR>
  <BR>
  </P>
  <P>and a few lines further down, Tyler refers to the &quot;old love&quot;
  <BR>
  <BR>
  </P>
  <PRE>
		who in 1916 was young
		who in 1918 was older
		who in 1923 was still older
                           in 1928. . . .  
	The hero                     (GB 14, ellipses Tyler's)</PRE>
  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <P>Here the monotonous abstractions of the opening passage (&quot;Secret
  name of the father / Name of another&quot;) give way to pretentious Shakespearean
  allusions (Othello's &quot;Not poppy, nor mandragora. . .) dressed in blank
  verse, followed by a vaguely Hart Cranian subway scene, and finally a coy
  reference to the poet's idol, the cataloguing of dates reading almost like
  comic pastiche. What, after all, could Blackwell be in 1923 but older than
  he was in 1916 and 1918? </P>
  <P><I>The Granite Butterfly</I> has better passages than this one. The
  little playlets in Canto 3 (&quot;Boredom&quot;), recall, not so much a
  &quot;pre-Pinter Pinter,&quot; as Boultenhouse suggests (GB xix), but the
  Frank O'Hara of <I>Try! Try! </I>, written less than a decade later. The
  alternation of screen-play setting, with its detailed account of an &quot;idyllic&quot;
  country landscape, and dialogue has a campy tone:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>ACT ONE</P>
    <P>HE: Come here.</P>
    <P>SHE: (Invisible) Why?</P>
    <P>HE: Come here.</P>
    <P>SHE: In a minute.</P>
    <P>HE: Can't wait.</P>
    <P>SHE: (Appearing) What is it?</P>
    <P>HE: Guess.</P>
    <P>SHE: Oh, that. Oh, that.</P>
    <P>HE: Never know.</P>
    <P>SHE: Might have known. (GB 17)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Such passages suggest that, had Tyler given in to his own best impulses,
  he might have been a delicious comic writer. But it is when Tyler is serious
  (and in most of <I>The Granite Butterfly</I>, he is dead serious!) that
  he falls flat, as when in Canto 4, he describes Blackwell's nose as &quot;flawless
  / Specific / Point of the nose / Long, classic, virile, out / From the
  face / Nostrils pyramidal / Flatulent, openings almost / Level with the
  bottom / line / Of the nose in profile / Agony of / Identification, it
  was He&quot; (GB 23). If this &quot;Agony of itness&quot; were carried
  just a shade further, we would be in the burlesque world of New York poetry,
  fifties-style, the world of O'Hara's &quot;Meditations in an Emergency&quot;
  or Ashbery's &quot;'They Dream only of America'.&quot; </P>
  <P>As it is, however, this would-be surrealist dream poem remains resolutely
  Freudian, Symbolist, and Heavy, an escape, perhaps, from the war years
  in which it was conceived and written. Oddly, World War II makes no appearance
  in Tyler's Oedipal family drama, his aim, like that of Delmore Schwartz
  or the late O'Neill, being to celebrate the uniqueness of the individual
  rather than to take up questions of collective history or culture. But--to
  come back to Williams--Canto 4 begins with a passage worth remarking on:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Conscience, color of night and color of day</P>
    <P>Beautiful thing! rising</P>
    <P>Like Venus from the waves of being</P>
    <P>Link, link to all. . . . (GB 22)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Can the echo of these lines in <I>Paterson</I> III be coincidental?
  Surely not, although Williams's &quot;Beautiful thing&quot; takes on many
  more and complex shapes than Tyler's Venus. Indeed, by the later forties,
  one might say of the connection between the two poets, the Williams of
  &quot;no ideas but in things,&quot; was moving toward the archetypal &quot;beautiful
  thing,&quot; a &quot;beautiful thing&quot; of mythology and phallic fantasy.
  </P>
  <P>And perhaps this explains Williams's excessive praise of <I>The Granite
  </I>Butterfly, his comparison of Tyler's poem to the despised <I>Waste
  Land</I>. By the mid-forties, Eliot had been fully canonized, and would
  soon bestow accolades, in his turn, on the late modern, late Symbolist
  Robert Lowell of <I>Lord Weary's Castle</I>, a book that Williams regarded
  with suspicion, until Lowell wrote his glowing review of Book 1 of <I>Paterson</I>.
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="parker_footnotes.html#7" TARGET="resource window">7</A>)</FONT> In 1945, <I>Paterson</I> had
  not yet been published, Pound was in disgrace, the Objectivists, except
  for Zukofsky, had gone underground, and Williams, who remained neglected
  by the New Critics, must have felt extremely isolated. How, he must have
  wondered, to buck the tide of the seemingly all-encompassing Eliotic mode?
  Surrealism, at least the way it was represented in New York by the refugee
  artists from France and Spain, seemed to provide the answer. And Tyler
  had sterling avant-garde credentials, having edited <I>Blues</I> and now
  the surrealist-oriented <I>View</I>. Hence, in what is surely one of the
  ironies of literary history, Williams convinced himself that <I>The Granite
  Butterfly</I>--a late symbolist poem that could speak to an anti-Williamsite
  like Marius Bewley-- was radically innovative, a counterweight to such
  Eliot offshoots as the <I>Anabasis</I>, which Williams dismissed as representing
  the &quot;malady of the franco-gobi St. J. Perse&quot; (GB 133). </P>
  <P>And of course Tyler's &quot;Athenian&quot; poem (Williams's way of referring
  to its overt homosexuality) <I>was</I> innovative in its explicit admission
  of sexual orientation. Meanwhile, the negotiation between Surrealism and
  late Freudian Symbolism was left to Williams himself. <I>Paterson</I> III
  takes Tyler's &quot;beautiful thing&quot; and creates a complex collage-text
  out of documentary bits (newspaper cuttings, slang letters) and lyric sequences
  so that Tyler's Narcissus-Oedipus-Perseus is brought down to earth, specifically
  &quot;Downstairs / (by the laundry tubs),&quot; where &quot;Beautiful thing&quot;
  is to be found &quot;by the wall on your damp bed, your long body streched
  out negligently on the dirty sheet&quot; (P 124-25). And it is in this
  sense, that the reproduction of <I>The Granite Butterfly</I>, with the
  supplementary documents the editors have included, is such an important
  literary event. The National Poetry Foundation has produced a beautiful
  edition, from the Maya Deren cover photograph to the inclusion of the Joseph
  Cornell photocollage from &quot;The Hunchbacked Bear,&quot; a collage that
  has a small still photo of Tyler's adored Carlyle Blackwell, the head fixed
  backward on a skier's torso, the skis all but impaled on what looks like
  a giant rack (see unnumbered figure 2). An emblem of the transition from
  modernism to postmodernism, Parker Tyler's &quot;granite butterfly&quot;
  rises from the weight of its restrictive stone cocoon and is perched for
