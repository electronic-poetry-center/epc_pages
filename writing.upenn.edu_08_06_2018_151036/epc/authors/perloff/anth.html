<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0603AE" SIZE=+1>In the two-year span 1993-1994</FONT>,
  no less than three major poetry anthologies appeared that featured the
  poetry of what has been called &quot;the other tradition&quot;--the tradition
  inaugurated thirty-five years ago by Donald M. Allen's <I>New American
  Poetry</I>: <I>1945-1960 </I>(New York: Grove Press, 1960). These three
  anthologies are, in the order of publication, Eliot Weinberger's <I>American
  Poetry since 1950: Innovators &amp; Outsiders</I> (New York: Marsilio,
  1993), Paul Hoover's <I>Postmodern American Poetry</I> (New York: Norton,
  1994), and Douglas Messerli's <I>From the Other Side of the Century. A
  New American Poetry 1960-1990</I> (Los Angeles: Sun &amp; Moon, 1994).
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#1" target="resource window">1</A>)</FONT> In 1994, moreover, there were two
  other large anthologies of alternate poetries by &quot;younger&quot; poets,
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#2" target="resource window">2</A>)</FONT> these two in the tradition of
  Ron Silliman's <I>In The American Tree</I>: <I>Language, Poetry, Realism</I>
  (Orono, ME: National Poetry Foundation, 1986) and Douglas Messerli's earlier
  <I>'Language' Poetries: An Anthology</I> (New York: New Directions, 1987).
  They are Peter Gizzi, Connell McGrath, and Juliana Spahr's two-volume anthology
  called <I>Writing from the New Coast</I> (Stockbridge, MA: Oblek editions,
  1994), <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#3" target="resource window">3</A>)</FONT> and Dennis Barone and
  Peter Ganick's <I>The Art of Practice. 45 Contemporary Poets</I> (Elmwood,
  CT: Potes &amp; Poets Press, 1994).</P>
  <P>Five volumes, then, of the &quot;new&quot; alternate poetries. And a
  sixth--this time a real blockbuster--is in progress from the University
  of California Press: Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris's two-volume <I>Poems
  for the Millenium</I>: The University of California <I>Book of Modern &amp;
  Postmodern Poetry,</I> which differs from all of the above by covering
  poetry and poetics of the entire twentieth century and from around the
  world. The first volume of <I>Poems for the Millenium, From Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle
  to Negritude</I> (1995), takes us from such &quot;forerunners&quot; of
  Modernism as Blake, H&ouml;lderlin, Dickinson and Rimbaud through the Futurisms,
  Dada, Surrealism, and Objectivism, along with complex &quot;galleries&quot;
  of individual poets, while the second--and sure to be more controversial--
  volume (1997) brings us up to the global present. </P>
  <P>A new avant-garde thus seems to be in the making--indeed, oxymoronic
  as it may sound, a new avant-garde consensus. Yet the counter-canonizing
  of the recent anthologies is not without its own aporias. What these are
  is my subject here.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0603A7">The Modest Opposition</FONT></B></P>
  <P>My starting point is that of the avant-garde anthologists themselves:
  Donald Allen's <I>New American Poetry</I> of 1960. From the vantage point
  of 1995, the most startling thing about the Allen anthology--still acknowledged
  by all later anthologists as the fountainhead of radical American poetics--
  is its modesty. <I>The New American Poetry</I> runs to 454 pages, including
  Statements of Poetics, Biographical Notes, and a Short Bibliography; it
  contains forty-four poets, all of them having come to prominence in the
  period between 1945 (the end of World War II) and 1960 (the date of publication).
  The four-page preface opens as follows:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>In the years since the war American poetry has entered upon a singularly
    rich period. It is a period that has seen published many of the finest
    achievements of the older generation: William Carlos Williams' <I>Paterson</I>,
    <I>The Desert Music and Other Poems</I>, and <I>Journey to Love</I>; Ezra
    Pound's <I>The Pisan Cantos</I>, <I>Section: Rock-Drill</I>, and <I>Thrones</I>;
    H.D.'s later work culminating in her long poem <I>Helen in Egypt</I>; and
    the recent verse of E. E. Cummings, Marianne Moore, and the late Wallace
    Stevens. A wide variety of poets of the second generation, who emerged
    in the thirties and forties, have achieved their maturity in this period:
    Elizabeth Bishop, Edwin Denby, Robert Lowell, Kenneth Rexroth, and Louis
    Zukofsky, to name only a few very diverse talents. And we can now see that
    a strong third generation, long awaited but only slowly recognized, has
    at last emerged. (p. xi).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Note that Allen introduces the &quot;new&quot; American poetry, not
  as an &quot;alternative&quot; to anything else but as the successor of
  two preceding generations. He does not quarrel about the Moderns: if Eliot
  isn't included in the above list, it is because he had stopped writing
  lyric poetry after <I>Four Quartets</I> and had turned to the theatre.
  The cited second generation, moreover, is more &quot;diverse&quot; (Allen's
  word) here than it will ever be again in the anthologies: Bishop <I>and</I>
  Denby, Lowell <I>and</I> Rexroth <I>and</I> Zukofsky. And the third generation,
  presumably following in the footsteps of the first and second, is now said
  to be emerging.</P>
  <P>Here Allen indulges in a mild sleight-of-hand. Charles Olson, the <I>chef
  d'&eacute;cole</I> of <I>The New American Poetry</I>, was born in 1910,
  seven year before Robert Lowell. Other members of this generation included
  by Allen are Robert Duncan (b. 1919), Lawrence Ferlinghetti (b. 1919),
  Barbara Guest (b. 1920), Jack Kerouac (b. 1922), and Denise Levertov (b.
  1923). Allen is surely aware of these discrepancies but he evidently wants
  to present his &quot;new poets&quot; as successors rather than rivals so
  as to strengthen his hand. And there is another reason that &quot;thirdness&quot;
  is emphasized:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>These new younger poets have written a large body of work, but most
    of what has been published so far has appeared only in a few little magazines,
    as broadsheets, pamphlets, and limited editions, or circulated in manuscript;
    a large amount of it has reached its growing audience through poetry readings.
    (DA xi)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Here is the <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I> of Allen's anthology: he is introducing
  to the larger poetry public, which would notice Grove (Evergreen) Press
  Books in the bookshops, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#4" target="resource window">4</A>)</FONT> a group
  of poets <I>who have not yet been published</I>, except in small-press
  editions, broadsides (then much less common than now), and the little magazines.
  Whereas Lowell's <I>Lord Weary's Castle</I> (1947) had been published by
  Harcourt, Brace and <I>Life Studies</I> (1959) by Farrar, Strauss, Olson's
  <I>In Cold Hell in Thicket </I>had been brought out by Cid Corman's esoteric
  little magazine, <I>Origin</I> (1953) and <I>The Maximus Poems </I>1-10
  by Jonathan Williams's equally esoteric Jargon Press in North Carolina
  (1953). The need to get the word out thus seemed urgent: &quot;third generation,&quot;
  ostensibly a chronological term, meant something more like &quot;third
  world&quot;--the neglected Other. </P>
  <P>Accordingly, Allen felt little compunction (or inclination) to theorize
  as to the nature of the New American Poetry. He tersely said: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>. . . this poetry] has shown one common characteristic: a total rejection
    of all those qualities typical of academic verse. Following the practice
    and precepts of Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams, it has built on
    their achievements and gone on to evolve new conceptions of the poem. These
    poets have already created their own tradition, their own press, and their
    public. They are our avant-garde, the true continuers of the modern movement
    in American poetry. Through their work many are closely allied to modern
    jazz and abstract expressionist painting, today recognized throughout the
    world to be America's greatest achievements in contemporary culture. This
    anthology makes the same claim for the new American poetry. (DA xi-xii)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Note the paucity of explanation: the New American Poets &quot;reject
  all those qualities typical of academic verse,&quot; and many are &quot;closely
  allied&quot; to jazz or abstract expressionist painting. Period. The reader
  can expect poems written in free verse and an &quot;open&quot; typography
  rather than in meter and stanza forms, and there may well be jazz rhythms
  (however those are transferred to poetry) and/or verbal equivalents to
  &quot;abstract expressionist&quot; painting.</P>
  <P>Pound's &quot;Make it New!&quot; thus becomes Allen's &quot;Keep it
  Brief!&quot; Avoid theoretical and ideological battles because your reader
  is bound to find exceptions. And indeed Allen is guided by two simple principles
  of selection: non-publication in the major venues, and, as the editor now
  goes on to explain, group identity or what we might call <I>community</I>.
  There are five such groups in the anthology. The first comprises &quot;poets
  identified with the two important magazines of the period, <I>Origin</I>
  and <I>Black Mountain Review</I>&quot; : Charles Olson, Robert Duncan,
  Robert Creeley, Edward Dorn, Joel Oppenheimer, Jonathan Williams, Paul
  Blackburn, Paul Carroll, Larry Eigner, and Denise Levertov. Note that of
  these ten, only one (Levertov) is a woman--a fact which will become important
  in alternate canon-making later. And note further that Olson, Duncan, and
  Creeley constitute a kind of triumvirate, the other male poets being somewhat
  secondary, even for Allen, as they will be for later anthologists. Indeed,
  one, Paul Carroll, has disappeared from just about everyone's list.</P>
  <P>The second group is designated as the San Francisco Renaissance, Duncan
  emerging as the leading poet of this group even as he also belongs to Black
  Mountain. These poets, who largely became known through oral performance
  in the Bay Area, include the following thirteen: Brother Antoninus (William
  Everson), Robin Blaser, Jack Spicer, James Broughton, Madeline Gleason,
  Helen Adam, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Bruce Boyd, Kirby Doyle, Richard Duerden,
  Philip Lamantia, Ebbe Borregaard, and Lew Welch. </P>
  <P>The San Francisco Renaissance is closely allied to the third group,
  &quot;The Beat Generation,&quot; the main difference being that the latter
  was originally associated with New York. It includes Allen Ginsberg, his
  young friend Peter Orlovsky, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso--only four poets,
  all of whom, incidentally, came into contact with the second group at readings
  in San Francisco.</P>
  <P>The fourth group is that of the New York Poets: John Ashbery, Kenneth
  Koch, and Frank O'Hara, who met at Harvard and migrated to Manhattan, where
  they in turn met Edward Field, Barbara Guest, and James Schuyler. This
  is of course the group allied with Abstract Expressionism. And finally,
  Allen isolates a fifth group of somewhat younger poets that &quot;has no
  geographical definition.&quot; Snyder and Whalen, allied to the Beats,
  are more properly placed here, as are Stuart Perkoff, Michael McClure,
  Ron Loewinsohn, Ray Bremser, David Meltzer, John Wieners, Edward Marshall,
  Gilbert Sorrentino, and LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka). Again, there are overlaps:
  Baraka was a close friend of O'Hara's in New York and edited <I>Yugen</I>;
  McClure was linked to the San Francisco Renaissance, and so on. As Allen
  says, his groups are &quot;for the most part more historical than actual&quot;
  and &quot;can be justified finally only as a means to give the reader some
  sense of milieu&quot; (xiii).</P>
  <P>Why should the publication of this relatively small anthology, comprised
  of forty-four then largely unknown poets, located primarily in New York,
  San Francisco, or, so to speak, &quot;On the Road,&quot; become such an
  historical event? First, because in the early sixties, there really was
  a dominant poetic discourse--a discourse, incidentally, that, from our
  vantage point in the nineties, was by no means that of the Modernism of
  the early century. In 1960, the Age Demanded that a poem be self-contained,
  coherent, and unified: that it present, indirectly to be sure, a paradox,
  oblique truth or special insight, utilizing the devices of irony, concrete
  imagery, symbolism, and structural economy. The paradigmatic poem was John
  Crowe Ransom's &quot;The Equilibrists,&quot; or perhaps his &quot;Bells
  for John Whiteside's Daughter.&quot; The speaker was &quot;dramatized&quot;--a
  persona, whose relation to the poem's author was &quot;hidden&quot;; the
  norm was <I>show</I> not <I>tell</I>, as Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn
  Warren repeatedly pointed out in their <I>Understanding Poetry. </I></P>
  <P>In this context, it must have been wholly exhilerating to pick up <I>The
  New America Poetry</I> and read, in its opening pages, a poem by Charles
  Olson called &quot;The Kingfishers&quot; that began &quot;What does not
  change / is the will to change,&quot; and then shifted to the narrative
  of &quot;He woke, fully clothed, in his bed. He / remembered only one thing,
  the birds. . . ,&quot; where the line break comes after &quot;He.&quot;
  Again, it must have been exhilerating to read a poem called &quot;Why I
  am not a Painter,&quot; that begins inconsequentially with the &quot;stanza,&quot;
  </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>I am not a painter, I am a poet.</P>
    <P>Why? I think I would rather be</P>
    <P>a painter, but I am not. Well. . . (DA 243)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>And of course Allen included Parts I and II of &quot;Howl,&quot; known
  in 1960 only to those who had heard Ginsberg's impassioned readings in
  San Francisco or New York and to those who got hold of the little City
  Lights book from Lawrence Ferlinghetti.</P>
  <P>I shall not rehearse yet again this familiar material. I only want to
  remind you of how many now-classic poems first became known through Don
  Allen's anthology, as did such pivotal poetic statements as Olson's &quot;Projective
  Verse&quot; with its call for &quot;COMPOSITION BY FIELD&quot; and its
  definition of the poem as an &quot;energy construct&quot; or &quot;energy
  discharge,&quot; a <I>projectile</I>, in which &quot;FORM IS NEVER MORE
  THAN AN EXTENSION OF CONTENT&quot; and &quot;ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY
  AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION.&quot; Never mind, that most
  of these prescriptions had been formulated much earlier by Pound and Williams
  (whom Olson now dismissed as the &quot;inferior predecessors&quot; <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#5" target="resource window">5</A>)</FONT>); in 1960 they helped clear the air
  with the force of Olson's own &quot;get on with it, keep moving. . . USE
  USE USE THE PROCESS AT ALL POINTS&quot; (p. 388).</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#02147B">The New American Poetry Revised: Familiar Outsiders</FONT></B></P>
  <P>So popular was <I>The New American Poetry</I> that by the late seventies,
  Don Allen was being urged on all sides to revise it and bring it up to
  date.</P>
  <P>Many of his &quot;New American Poets,&quot; after all, had not especially
  panned out: especially such San Francisco poet-friends of Allen's as Ebbe
  Borregaard, Bruce Boyd, Ray Bremser, and James Broughton, to take only
  four. Others like Jack Kerouac and Lew Welch had died prematurely. And
  there was, by this time, a demand for more women. The result was <I>The
  Postmoderns: The New American Poetry Revised</I> (New York: Grove Press,
  1982), edited by Allen with the help of the late Olson scholar, editor,
  and poet, George F. Butterick. As against the modest Preface of the earlier
  volume, <I>The Postmoderns</I> has a much more serious introduction (evidently
  written largely by Butterick <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#6" target="resource window">6</A>)</FONT>),
  and more comprehensive biographical and bibliographical materials. Of the
  forty-four original poets, fifteen were dropped, less on the grounds of
  absolute merit than because of their lack of ongoing production or, as
  in the case of Gilbert Sorrentino, a shift to writing fiction rather than
  lyric. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#7" target="resource window">7</A>)</FONT> Nine poets were added:
  in alphabetical order, Diane di Prima, Anselm Hollo, Robert Kelly, James
  Koller, Joanne Kyger, Jackson Mac Low, Jerome Rothenberg, Ed Sanders, and
  Ann Waldman. And the geographical groupings were eliminated in favor of
  a chronological arrangement. </P>
  <P>With all this tinkering, the punch of the original <I>New American Poetry</I>
  was largely lost. Here Butterick's new Preface is revealing. Opposition
  to &quot;academic verse&quot; and &quot;formalism&quot; is no longer enough:
  rather the new &quot;experimental&quot; poetry, so the editors claim, is
  squarely in &quot;the mainstream of Emerson and Whitman, Pound and Williams&quot;
  (GB 9). And we read:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>For some, imagism has been a chief source of inspiration, for others--
    notably O'Hara and Ashbery--the dissociations of post-symbolist French
    poetry. They respond to the limits of industrialism and high technology
    often by a marked spiritual advance or deference, an embracing of the primal
    energies of a tribal or communal spirit, side by side with the most stubborn
    sort of American individualism.. . . . There are revolutionaries among
    them, as well as quiet (but no less deliberate) practitioners. Their most
    common bond is a spontaneous utilization of subject and technique, a prevailing
    &quot;instantism&quot; that nevertheless does not preclude discursive ponderings
    and large-canvased reflections. . . . They are most of them forward-looking
    at a time when concepts such as entropy and global village have entered
    daily life. (GB 9)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The difficulty here, of course, is that each of the characteristics
  listed could apply equally well to an entirely different set of poets.
  Imagism as &quot;inspiration&quot;: well, yes, that certainly covers the
  case of Mark Strand or Galway Kinnell, Louise Gluck and Charles Wright.
  The &quot;dissociations of post-symbolist French poetry,&quot; otherwise
  known as Surrealism are notable in James Wright, Charles Simic, and Sylvia
  Plath. As for the &quot;spiritual&quot; response to the &quot;limits of
  industrialism,&quot; think of Elizabeth Bishop and Adrienne Rich, Richard
  Hugo and William Stafford, &quot;Tribal and communal energies&quot; (Butterick
  is evidently referring to the ethnopoetics of Jerome Rothenberg) were turning
  up in the new black poetry--for example, Audre Lorde's and Michael Harper's,
  which is not included in <I>The Postmoderns</I>. As for the &quot;prevailing
  'instantism',&quot; cited as the postmoderns' &quot;most common bond,&quot;
  surely Robert Bly could lay claim to this trait as might W.S. Merwin. </P>
  <P>&quot;The passage of twenty years,&quot; claim the editors, &quot;has
  brought confirmation of the achievements of the poets represented&quot;
  (GB 11). So it had, but as they themselves recognize, &quot;confirmation&quot;
  goes hand in hand with mainstreaming. &quot;There are countless articles
  and scholarly dissertations,&quot; we read, &quot;devoted to [the poets']
  work, translations of their writings into foreign languages, biographies,
  bibliographies (a recent comprehensive bibliography of Frank O'Hara's writings
  runs to well over three hundred pages), published interviews, editions
  of their correspondence and secondary writings&quot; (GB 11). Indeed, by
  1982, those unknown broadside and &quot;little mag&quot; poets Robert Creeley
  and Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, had become nothing if
  not &quot;respectable.&quot; And although some of the &quot;Postmoderns&quot;
  (say, the difficult Jackson Mac Low and the challenging Jerome Rothenberg)
  continued to be excluded from the mainstream anthologies and the Norton
  Anthologies of Poetry, others, notably John Ashbery, were winning all the
  Establishment prizes. </P>
  <P>Indeed, by 1982, there was no longer a clear line of demarcation between
  the raw and the cooked, the oppositional and the established, the &quot;experimental&quot;
  and the &quot;safe.&quot; Metrics-as-such was no longer a differentium
  because everyone was writing free verse. Keep-It-Moving projectivism had
  lost some of its edge because poetasters all over the U.S. were &quot;keeping
  it moving&quot; in dozens of little magazines and <I>American Poetry Review</I>.
  Then, too, latter-day New York or San Francisco Renaissance poetry, as
  in the case of Ann Waldman, Ed Sanders, and Joanne Kyger, no longer seemed
  especially revolutionary. Language Poetry, after all, had already reared
  its head--the journal <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</I> began to appear in 1978, and
  Ron Silliman reminds us in his Preface to <I>In the </I>American Tree that
  it was in the first issue of <I>This</I> (1971) that Robert Grenier, who
  co-founded the magazine with Barrett Watten, announced &quot;I HATE SPEECH,&quot;
  a battle-cry that, however much we now take it with a grain of salt, &quot;announced
  a breach--and a new moment in American writing.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#8" target="resource window">8</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>If the <I>The Postmoderns</I> thus has something of a retro air, the
  problem is that the &quot;radical&quot; tradition of &quot;Projective Verse,&quot;
  which was its point of departure, and which was by this time some thirty
  years old, was accepted by its adherents as normative without the further
  debate which might have thickened the plot. Perhaps this happened because
  the Olsonites were still embattled, seeing that, in the larger world, &quot;composition
  by field&quot; had never quite caught on. The same belatedness, in any
  case, characterizes Weinberger's <I>American Poetry Since 1950: </I>Innovators
  and Outsiders.</P>
  <P>Weinberger's prefatory note begins with the (by now) familiar division
  into &quot;two camps.&quot; &quot;On the one side is a ruling party that
  insists there is no ruling party . . . yet it is a party that clearly exists
  in the minds of those outside it, who have derided it with adjectives like
  <I>conventional, establishment</I>, <I>official</I>, <I>academic</I>, and
  have pitched their own poetics as alternatives to the prevailing humdrum.
  On the other side is an opposition still intensely aware of its outsider
  status, yet now increasingly dissatisfied with the banners under which
  it once rallied: <I>avant-garde</I>, <I>experimental</I>, <I>non-academic</I>,
  <I>radical</I>&quot; (EW xi). Yet, even if these &quot;banners&quot; no
  longer work, even if &quot;the distinction between the two parties has
  always been blurred,&quot; Weinberger is nevertheless convinced that &quot;inequities
  . . . have indeed existed. Today, in the current population explosion of
  poets, they are greater than ever&quot; (EW xi).</P>
  <P>But Weinberger's thirty-five chosen &quot;innovators and outsiders,&quot;
  all of them from the U.S. (as in the two Allen anthologies, no poets from
  other English-speaking countries are included) are an odd lot. His two
  principles of inclusion are (1) only poems first published in book form
  since 1950 and (2) no poets born after World War II. The resulting chronological
  list is as follows: William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, H.D., Charles
  Reznikoff, Langston Hughes, Lorine Niedecker, Louis Zukofsky, Kenneth Rexroth,
  George Oppen, Charles Olson, William Everson, John Cage, Muriel Rukeyser,
  William Bronk, Robert Duncan, Jackson Mac Low, Denise Levertov, Jack Spicer,
  Paul Blackburn, Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,
  Nathaniel Tarn, Gary Snyder, Jerome Rothenberg, David Antin, Amiri Baraka,
  Clayton Eshleman, Ronald Johnson, Robert Kelly, Gustaf Sobin, Susan Howe,
  Clark Coolidge, and Michael Palmer.</P>
<P>In a now notorious essay for <I>American Poetry Review</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
HREF="anth_footnotes.html#9" target="resource window">9</A>)</FONT> (23, no. 2
[March / April 1994]), John Yau argues
  that Weinberger has too readily taken over the aesthetic of Ezra Pound,
  an aesthetic, in Yau's words, &quot;which promotes assimilationism and
  imperialism&quot; (APR 45). Thus Pound's <I>Cathay</I>, with its appropriation
  of China as some sort of exotic <I>Other</I>, is hardly the ideal yardstick
  by which to measure the current work of the &quot;innovators and outsiders,&quot;
  some of whom happen to be Chinese, who are producing poetry in the U.S.
  today. Indeed, Yau insists, the Pound-Williams-H.D. &quot;tradition&quot;
  is used by Weinberger as license to create a genealogy of what are almost
  exclusive white male poets, especially those whose work displays &quot;an
  acceptable confluence of mythology, geography, history, and the exoticizing
  view of the <I>Other</I>&quot; (APR 48). Had Weinberger begun with Gertrude
  Stein rather than the Pound-H.D.-Williams tradition, Yau argues, he might
  have appreciated the value of Barbara Guest, Rosmarie Waldrop, and Lyn
  Hejinian. And Yau now goes on to play the &quot;Where is?&quot; game, castigating
  Weinberger for his omission of women and minorities, of homeless poets
  and poets who have AIDS, and so on.</P>
  <P>This &quot;where is?&quot; game strikes me as something of a cheap shot.
  Omission of one sort or another is, of course, a defining feature of all
  anthologies: someone is always going to be left out and someone else is
  going to be indignant about it. But although Yau plays the minority card
  rather too piously, and although his critique of Pound's representation
  of China largely ignores the context in which <I>Cathay</I> was actually
  produced and disseminated, Yau is on to something important: namely, the
  peculiar <I>belatedness</I> of Weinberger's narrative. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#10" target="resource window">10</A>)</FONT> Donald Allen's <I>The New American Poetry</I>,
  after all, was just that--New. It covered the years 1945-60. The preface
  paid homage to Pound and Williams, but certainly didn't include their work.
  In Weinberger's anthology, on the other hand, the &quot;new&quot; in Allen's
  sense includes exactly four of the thirty-five poets: Sobin, Howe, Coolidge,
  and Palmer. The book begins with four Modernist masters (Pound, Williams,
  H. D., Hughes), goes on to include four Objectivists (Niedecker, Reznikoff,
  Zukofsky, Oppen), fourteen poets from <I>The New American Poetry</I>, and
  three more from <I>The Postmoderns</I>. That leaves seven poets who are
  what we might call Donald Allen should-have-beens, in that they were excluded
  from the second gathering largely by fluke, belonging by rights to the
  congeries already represented. These seven are David Antin, William Bronk,
  John Cage, Clayton Eshleman, Ronald Johnson, Kenneth Rexroth, Muriel Rukeyser,
  and Nathaniel Tarn. </P>
  <P>Innovators and outsiders? Almost all of the above (Coolidge is an exception)
  have published with respected presses: New Directions, Black Sparrow, North
  Point, and, in Rukeyser's case, Norton. And eight of the thirty-five--Niedecker,
  Olson, Creeley, Duncan, Ginsberg, Levertov, O'Hara, and Ashbery-- are included
  in volume 2 of the most recent <I>Norton Anthology of American Literature</I>.
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#11" target="resource window">11</A>)</FONT> Indeed, Weinberger's anthology
  is best understood as a &quot;New American Poetry-Plus,&quot; the line
  being extended backward to Pound and Williams and forward to Susan Howe.</P>
  <P>There is nothing wrong with this selection as such, given that Weinberger
  originally published it in Spanish for Mexican and Latin American consumption.
  On the contrary, it is wonderful that an anthology of such high calibre
  (and evidently largely unknown in Spanish) work will be read by a new Latin
  American audience. For the U.S. reader, however, the selection does pose
  serious problems. Why, to begin with, the belatedness and buttressing,
  the need to begin an anthology of <I>contemporary poetry<B> </B></I>with
  the work of the great Modernists? And a related problem: by what criteria
  are the lesser poets in Weinberger's anthology--say, Nathaniel Tarn and
  Ronald Johnson-- superior to the mainstream--Berryman, Lowell, Jarrell,
  Bishop-- whom Weinberger dismisses as purveyors of the &quot;American image
  of the poet as an overgrown disturbed child prodigy&quot; (EW 397)? True,
  Weinberger refers to the &quot;open-ended rather than closed forms&quot;
  of his &quot;innovators&quot; and talks of their &quot;simultaneity&quot;
  and &quot;musicality&quot; (399). But when he concludes that &quot;in the
  end, what united these poets was, in opposition to the prevailing canon,
  Pound's exhortation to 'Make it new,'&quot; (EW 399), he is applying the
  very standard Donald Allen used thirty-five years earlier.<BR>
  </P>
  <P>When a critic as sophisticated as Eliot Weinberger falls into this trap--and
  we will witness the same phenomenon again and again in the anthologies
  of our decade-- there must be a valid reason. My own sense is that we are
  suffering, in the poetically rich and perhaps excessively diverse 1990s,
  from what I should like to call the malaise of the mid-century. When Donald
  Allen (or, for that matter, his conservative antagonists) produced their
  anthologies in 1960, there was little doubt as to the position of the Great
  Modernist Precursors. True, one could quarrel as to the relative merits
  of Robert Frost or of e. e. cummings, true such forgotten women poets as
  Mina Loy and Laura Riding Jackson had not yet been rediscovered. But whose
  list did not include Eliot and Pound, Stevens and Williams, Moore and H.D.,
  Gertrude Stein and Hart Crane? Add to these the English poet Auden, the
  French Val&eacute;ry and Reverdy, Apollinaire and Cendrars, the German
  Rilke, Trakl, and Brecht, the Spanish Lorca, and Argentinian Neruda, and
  you have a pretty fixed notion of what Modernism-in-Poetry would look like.</P>
  <P>But there has never been this agreement about the midcentury. We are
  now as far away from Charles Olson as Donald Allen was from Williams and
  Pound, and yet Olson's status as &quot;major poet&quot; is hotly contested.
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#12" target="resource window">12</A>)</FONT> Louis Zukofsky and his fellow
  Objectivists, whose early poetry is now a good sixty years in the past,
  are still not included in the <I>Norton Anthology of American Literature</I>.
  Critics who have no quarrel over Pound or Williams, cannot agree on the
  hypothetical place of John Berryman or Elizabeth Bishop in the canon. And
  what about Allen Ginsberg? A great poet whose million dollar archive was
  well worth the purchase made by Stanford University? The author, in John
  Hollander's view, of that &quot;execrable little book&quot; <I>Howl</I>?
  Or a poet whose importance rests on the earlier work, now turned rock musician?</P>
  <P>Those on both sides of these arguments continue to be defensive, even
  though they are battling, not over who has &quot;made it New&quot; but
  over the always-already tried and true and commodified. Hence the difficulty
  of waging the good fight, as did <I>les jeunes</I> of 1914, for a new new
  poetry. And here I turn to the big anthologies of 1994, Hoover's and Messerli's.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#010575">Blockbusters</FONT></B></P>
  <P>Paul Hoover's <I>Postmodern American Poetry</I> and Douglas Messerli's
  <I>From the Other Side of the Century</I> are designed largely for classroom
  use. Hoover's Norton anthology is meant to complement (and be used in tandem
  with), the &quot;regular' or &quot;mainstream&quot; Norton; it even has
  a teachers' manual. Messerli's aim is to put between two covers the very
  best of the movement to which he himself belongs, Language Poetry, even
  as he wants to buttress and contextualize that poetry by relating it to
  its sources and analogues. <I>Postmodern American Poetry</I> has 701 pages
  and 103 poets, <I>From the Other Side of the Century</I> includes somewhat
  fewer poets (84) but runs to 1135 pages, which means that its selections
  are much more comprehensive than what we usually find in anthologies. Is
  there, then, really so much more important poetry being written in America
  than there was in Donald Allen's day when a modest 454 pages could cover
  thirty-eight New American Poets? </P>
  <P>Or does size depend again on what we might call B &amp; B, belatedness
  and buttressing? Hoover's anthology covers forty years; it begins with
  Charles Olson and John Cage, and its first three-hundred pages are devoted
  to poetry familiar from the Allen anthology; Messerli's span is ten years
  shorter (1960-90) but here approximately 400 pages (one-third of the book)
  are given over to Donald Allen poets. <I>A New American Poetry</I> (Messerli's
  subtitle) is thus not-so-new. Still, this hyper-inclusion is not without
  its rationale. Hoover's anthology, to begin with, is designed to give us
  everything the other Nortons do not. True, there is some overlap--of which
  more, later--but where Norton A (<I>The Norton Anthology </I>of American
  Literature and the Richard Ellmann-Robert O'Clair <I>Modern Poems</I>,
  <I>A Norton Introduction</I>) <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#13" target="resource window">13</A>)</FONT>
  goes from Robert Lowell, William Stafford, and Gwendolyn Brooks to Howard
  Nemerov and Amy Clampitt, Anthony Hecht and James Dickey, Richard Hugo
  and Maxine Kumin, Galway Kinnell, W. S. Merwin, Philip Levine, and Adrienne
  Rich, Audre Lorde and June Jordan, Norton B includes a wide variety of
  &quot;others&quot; from Marjorie Welish and Ann Lauterbach, Lyn Hejinian
  and Susan Howe, Rae Armantrout and Carla Harryman, Alice Notley and Eileen
  Myles, to mention only some of the women poets included. Hoover covers
  almost as many language poets as does Messerli (but in significantly shorter
  selections); and his anthology includes the communities of St. Mark's in
  the Bowery in New York, New Langton Street and Intersection in San Francisco,
  and a wide variety of performative poetics and work by minority poets.</P>
  <P>As such, this anthology, with its useful biographical headnotes, statements
  of poetics, and bibliography fills a large gap: it is astonishing and encouraging
  that Norton felt called upon to do it at all. At the same time, Hoover's
  rationale is less than clear. The adjective <I>postmodern</I>, he explains
  in his Introduction, refers to &quot;the historical period following World
  War II.&quot; But since his anthology by no means includes all the prominent
  poets from that period, he specifies as follows:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>[Postmodern] also suggests an experimental approach to composition,
    as well as a worldview that sets itself apart from mainstream culture and
    the narcissism, sentimentality, and self-expressiveness of its life in
    writing. Postmodernist poetry is the avant-garde poetry of our time.. .
    . This anthology shows that avant-garde poetry endures in its resistance
    to mainstream ideology; it is the avant-garde that renews poetry as a whole
    through new, but initially shocking, artistic strategies. . . .</P>
    <P>Despite their differences, experimentalists in the postwar period have
    valued writing-as-process over writing-as-product . . . . Postmodernism
    decenters authority and embraces pluralism. (PH, xxv-xxvii).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Shades of Allen and Butterick's <I>The Postmoderns</I>, shades of Weinberger's
  <I>Innovators and Outsiders</I>. The trouble with all this talk of oppositionality
  to &quot;mainstream ideology&quot; is that it doesn't get down to cases.
  Is Adrienne Rich's poetry, certainly not included here, &quot;mainstream&quot;
  in its ideology? Does it believe in a &quot;centered&quot; authority? Her
  admirers would certainly say no. On the other side, how &quot;initially
  shocking&quot; are the &quot;artistic strategies&quot; of, say, Andrei
  Codrescu's &quot;Paper on Humor,&quot; which begins:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Everything sounds funny in a funny magazine.</P>
    <P>For years now I have published my poems in funny magazines</P>
    <P>so that nobody would notice</P>
    <P>how sad they were. (PH 482)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Whatever the reason for the inclusion of this poem--and I will come
  back to this issue --it can hardly be the shock of the new. The same holds
  true for Messerli's poets. His &quot;four major gatherings&quot; divide
  up 'innovative&quot; American poetry into those groups that emphasize (1)
  &quot;cultural issues--overlapping ideas about myth, politics, history,
  place, and religion; (2) self, social group, urban landscape, the visual
  arts, (3) language, and (4) performance, voice, genre, personae.&quot;
  (DM 32-33). But Messerli is the first to admit that there is no hard-and-fast
  distinction between these gatherings and that, indeed, his own anthology
  is based on &quot;specific aesthetic choices--eclectic as those might be&quot;
  (DM 31-32). </P>
  <P>What <I>is<B> </B></I>this aesthetic, an aesthetic that admits Marjorie
  Welish but not Ann Lauterbach, Diane Ward but not Kathleen Fraser, John
  Godfrey but not John Yau? Judging from Messerli's own poetry and critical
  prose as well as from the books he has published over the years for his
  Sun &amp; Moon Press (and before he founded the press, for his journals
  <I>Sun &amp; Moon</I> and <I>L&agrave; Bas</I>), Messerli's &quot;aesthetic&quot;
  is essentially that of the manifestos and statements of poetics collected
  in Bruce Andrews's and Charles Bernstein's <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book</I>
  of 1984. But because he had already produced one anthology of Language
  poetries in 1987, and because he evidently felt, as did Hoover and Weinberger
  in their different ways, that he had to buttress the case for this &quot;new
  American poetry&quot; as the heir to Donald Allen's, he includes the Objectivists,
  a good portion of Black Mountain and San Francisco poets, as well as the
  New York poets of the O'Hara-Ashbery generation and a careful selection
  of their followers. This is, in other words, a thesis-anthology: Messerli
  is in essence saying: &quot;Take another look at language poetry, this
  time in much fuller measure than in my earlier anthology, where space constraints
  were imposed on me by the publisher (New Directions). It really <I>is</I>
  the important poetry today: witness its derivation from Zukofsky and Oppen,
  O'Hara and Ashbery, and so on.&quot; </P>
  <P>Yet for a complex set of reasons (the decline of poetry publishing by
  the main commercial houses, the precarious place of &quot;poetry&quot;
  in the academic curriculum, the refusal of most critics to engage language
  poetries in any serious way even as, paradoxically, some of the poets--Charles
  Bernstein, Susan Howe, Bob Perelman, Michael Palmer-- have been quite successful),
  Messerli is reluctant to say these things. And so, like both Weinberger
  and Hoover in their different ways, Messerli has produced an &quot;avant-garde&quot;
  anthology that includes any number of poems--say those of John Ashbery--that
  are not only readily available from mainstream publishers like Viking or
  Alfred A. Knopf, but are also anthologized in such &quot;enemy&quot; anthologies
  as Helen Vendler's <I>Harvard Book of Contemporary Poetry</I>. &quot;These
  Lacustrine Cities,&quot; to take just one example, appears in both.</P>
  <P>One might conclude from such overlaps that the &quot;great&quot; poets
  of the period will eventually be seen to be those like Ashbery and O'Hara,
  Olson and Duncan, Creeley and Ginsberg, Levertov and Snyder, who so to
  speak, transcend the &quot;them versus us&quot; ideology initiated by Allen's
  <I>New American Poetry</I>, poets, let us say, who have made it into the
  <I>Norton Anthology of American Literature</I>. But it is not clear that
  this is the case, given the blatant omission of the Objectivists in the
  Norton or of Robert Creeley in Vendler's <I>Harvard Book</I>. At the same
  time, the perpetuation of the counter-canon-- where &quot;counter&quot;
  is too often a marker derived from the sixties rather than strenuously
  reconstructed-- seems to be perpetuating a less than happy situation. Let
  me explain. </P>

    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Each of these poems has twenty very short lines of free verse; in each,
  line-breaks seem to be determined by the process of voicing and breath
  unit outlined by Olson in &quot;Projective Verse,&quot; breaking up grammatical
  units, as in &quot;Trees stand / up&quot; in #1 &quot;and &quot;green /
  bush green / answering bush&quot; in #2. In both cases, lineation coupled
  with repetition brings out latent meanings, as in line 4 of #1--&quot;fog.
  The fog&quot;-- and lines 18-20 of #2: &quot;and nothing at all gets, /
  nothing gets / caught at all.&quot; <BR>
  </P>
  <P>In both &quot;The Breathing&quot; and &quot;Center,&quot; the perspective
  is that of the poet, who is never specified or even identified as &quot;I&quot;;
  the impetus, in both cases, is to record a particular moment when something
  in nature stands out and triggers an internal reaction, a kind of epiphany.
  &quot;The Breathing&quot; tracks the process whereby the poet's immersion
  in a momentary thick white fog produces a sense of almost mystical quietude.
  It begins with &quot;An absolute / patience,&quot; as the poet stops and
  is forced to take in the metamorphosis of nature the fog produces. The
  trees take on a life of their own; they &quot;stand up to their knees in
  /fog,&quot; which in turn becomes a river &quot;slowly flow[ing] uphill,&quot;
  and the &quot;grass&quot; is transformed into a network of &quot;white
  cobwebs.&quot; The process that anthropomorphizes nature paradoxically
  dehumanizes living creatures: the &quot;deer&quot; [who] have looked for
  apples&quot; are gone, and &quot;not one bird&quot; appears on the hill
  that rises just above the fogline. &quot;So absolute&quot; is the silence
  that the poet experiences a momentary lightness of being, &quot;no other
  than / happiness itself, a breathing&quot; that is, in this epiphany, too
  quiet to hear.</P>
  <P>&quot;Center&quot; embodies a similar paradox. The song of the bird
  that &quot;fills up the /streamside bush&quot; is &quot;wasteful&quot;
  because it can't be heard above the roar of the waterfall. The latter is
  seen as &quot;capsized&quot; because the eye, tracking the bird's movement
  from stream to bush to the sky above, sees it as moving in reverse, and
  blending with mill run and / superhighway&quot; so as to decline from the
  &quot;song's improvident / center&quot; up in the sky. Or rather, there
  is no center: the bird is lost in the green / bush green / answering bush&quot;;
  it disappears and the wind changes. As for the stream, &quot;the noon sun&quot;
  now &quot;casts / mesh refractions&quot; on its amber bottom, but this
  net of sunrays can capture nothing in its web: the bird song is gone. At
  the &quot;center,&quot; the poet suggests, there is an enormous absence.</P>
  <P>Both poems, then, use close observation of natural phenomena and the
  quick changes these undergo to express the inner self: in &quot;The Breathing,&quot;
  a momentary sense of quietude and peace within the white blanket of fog,
  in &quot;Center&quot; a recognition of difference, of the moment-to-moment
  metamorphoses of nature as birdsong vanishes above the sunny stream, without
  leaving a trace. In their positioning of the poet's eye and ear in a specific
  transitory natural setting, both poems are squarely in the Romantic tradition:
  the observer reads meanings into the landscape which in turn constructs
  the poet's identity in a momentary union of subject and object. The images,
  spare and carefully chosen, are allowed to do the work; in neither instance
  does the poet moralize or generalize as to how one can capture the radiance
  of the visible. And the diction in both cases is hushed and understated,
  assonance and consonance (e.g., &quot;The fog / slowly flow&quot; in #1;
  &quot;casts,&quot; &quot;refractions,&quot; &quot;gets&quot; in #2) replacing
  more over rhetorical effects.</P>
  <P>Which of these poems is &quot;establishment,&quot; which &quot;counterculture&quot;?
  &quot;The Breathing&quot; is by Denise Levertov and dates from her 1964
  collection <I>O Taste and See!</I>. &quot;Center&quot; is by A. R. Ammons
  and comes from <I>Corson's Inlet</I> (1965). Levertov, as we have seen,
  is included in every anthology I have discussed so far except Messerli's:
  that is, <I>The New American Poetry</I>, <I>The Postmoderns</I> (1982),
  <I>American Poetry Since 1950: Innovators and Outsiders</I> (1993), <I>Postmodern
  American Poetry</I> (1994), and the forthcoming Rothenberg-Joris <I>Poems
  for the Millenium</I>. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#14" target="resource window">14</A>)</FONT> Ammons
  appears in none of the above (nor in Messerli's), but he has, over the
  years, appeared in all the major &quot;mainstream&quot; anthologies, including
  Helen Vendler's <I>Harvard Book</I>. And both Ammons and Levertov are accorded
  almost exactly the same space (12 pages) in the <I>Norton Anthology of
  American Literature</I> and in the Norton <I>Modern Poems</I> (6 pages
  each). </P>
  <P>How do we explain the discrepancy between two poets, whose work, judging
  from these representative poems, is by no means all that dissimilar? Is
  Levertov's form more &quot;open&quot; than Ammons's? Is hers a &quot;processive&quot;
  mode, his a &quot;productive&quot;? Hers decentered, his centered and unitary?
  I would suggest that we could go through any number of Ammons and Levertov
  poems and although there are obvious differences, especially with respect
  to gender definition and politics, one is hard put to find one more &quot;oppositional&quot;
  than the other. The difference--and this happens in canon-making (even
  counter-canon making) all the time, has to do with particular literary
  and cultural affiliations.</P>
  <P>Denise Levertov, let us recall, first came into prominence as a disciple
  of William Carlos Williams. Born and brought up in England, she had only
  recently come to New York with her then-husband Mitchell Goodman, when
  in 1951 she was taken to meet Williams, who had already had a serious stroke.
  &quot;I have never forgot,&quot; Williams wrote to her in 1957, &quot;how
  you came to me out of the formalism of English verse. At first as must
  have been inevitable although I welcomed you I was not completely convinced,
  after all I wasn't completely convinced of my own position, I wanted YOU
  to convince ME.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#15" target="resource window">15</A>)</FONT> Levertov
  was evidently quite willing to play this role: the poems in her first American
  book, <I>Here and Now</I> (1957) out-Williams Williams: &quot;The Innocent,&quot;
  for example, begins:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The cat has his sport</P>
      <P>and the mouse suffers</P>
      <P>but the cat</P>

    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>where lineation, language, and tone are markedly Williamseque. </P>
  <P>Williams himself, as James E. B. Breslin points out was somewhat patronizing
  to this attractive young woman poet: in a 1954 letter he advises her: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>You need a book of your closely chosen work. I think, if you thought
    out and selected your choice very carefully, it would be one of the most
    worthwhile books of the generation. It would have to be a small book squeezed
    up to get the gists alone of what you have to say. Perhaps you will never
    be able to say what you want to say. In that case you make me feel that
    the loss will be great. (JEBB 32)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>But whatever Williams's own reservations, Levertov was now taken up
  by Rexroth and Creeley and, most important, by James Laughlin. In 1959,
  Levertov had what she herself calls &quot;the happiness and honor of becoming
  . . . a New Directions author,&quot; and she has been one ever since. Indeed,
  her contract is such that Laughlin will publish any poetry (or poetics)
  manuscript she cares to bring out. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#17" target="resource window">17</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>Donald Allen's <I>New American Poetry</I> appeared a year after Levertov
  had become a New Directions author, and quite naturally she was now included
  as a member of the Black Mountain group, along with Creeley and Duncan.
  And there she has, so to speak, remained, her position being especially
  strong because she is one of the very few women associated with Allen's
  original groupings. Thus, when Weinberger and Hoover produced their anthologies,
  Levertov became the emblematic poet of sixties oppositionality (as opposed,
  say, to Adrienne Rich or Sylvia Plath), a position she has retained over
  the years, even though her work has increasingly moved toward a linear
  (and rhetorically conservative) political protest poetry, toward confessionalism,
  and, most recently, toward Christian devotional poetry. <BR>
  </P>
  <P>Meanwhile, what of Ammons, who was also a great admirer of Williams?
  By the late fifties, Ammons too was writing poems like &quot;Jersey Cedars,&quot;
  whose opening adapts Williams's three-step line: <BR>
  </P>
  <PRE>
	The wind inclines the cedars and lets

  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <P>And <I>Corsons Inlet</I> (1965) has a poem called &quot;WCW&quot; that
  goes like this:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>

    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>But Ammons, a Southerner perhaps never quite at home in the urban Northeast,
  was not a member of the Williams or, later, the Olson-Creeley circle. While
  Levertov and others were making the pilgrimage from Manhattan to Rutherford
  in the fifties, Ammons was an executive vice-president for a pharmaceutical
  company called Friedrich and Dimmock, located, in what now seems like a
  delicious irony, in Millville, New Jersey, not far from William's own terrain.
  In these years, the two poets did meet once or twice, but in 1962 Ammons
  moved to Ithaca to teach at Cornell, where he has remained to this day.
  And at Cornell, he met Harold Bloom, who was to become one of his most
  passionate advocates and to place him firmly in the &quot;visionary company&quot;
  of Emerson, Whitman, and Stevens, a visionary company that excluded Williams,
  as it excluded Pound and Eliot. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#19" target="resource window">19</A>)</FONT>
  The rest, as they say, is history.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#02178A">The Fate of Anthologizing</FONT></B></P>
  <P>What lessons, if any, can we derive from this little narrative? First,
  that it is no longer possible, as it was for Donald Allen, to present readers
  with an anthology of <I>the</I> or even <I>a</I> definitive New American
  Poetry. In 1960, the scene was much less complicated than it is today:
  there really was an East Coast extablishment, consisting of New England
  and New York poets (mostly white men) and their publishers--the big houses
  like Harcourt Brace, Harper &amp; Row, W. W. Norton, Alfred A. Knopf, and
  Farrar, Strauss. In this context, publication by New Directions or the
  Grove Press was in itself an anti-establishment marker, and Don Allen,
  who had worked at New Directions before he went to Grove and from there
  to freelancing in San Francisco, could readily introduce his poets as the
  countercurrent. </P>
  <P>But by the early eighties, when Allen and Butterick produced <I>The
  Postmoderns</I>, all this had changed. For one thing, the communities of
  poets (raw <I>or</I> cooked, academic <I>or</I> anti-academic, formalist
  <I>or</I> &quot;open form&quot;) had vastly proliferated and the old dichotomies
  eroded. Creative Writing programs were now <I>de rigueur</I> at every college
  or university in the land, and fellowships, NEA or otherwise, were available.
  Poets of the counterculture like Allen Ginsberg and Robert Creeley now
  held university chairs and were selling their papers to university libraries
  for good prices. Then, too, the more conventional poets were beginning
  to experiment with fragmentation, typographic innovation, and varieties
  of free verse. </P>
  <P>More important: the eighties witnessed the coming of the minority communities:
  first women and African-Americans, then Chicano and Asian-American and
  Native American poets, gay and lesbian poets, and so on. In their inception,
  many of these poetries were, ironically, quite conservative so far as form,
  rhetoric, and the ontology of the poem were concerned. But counterculture
  poets and critics couldn't --and still can't--say this out loud because
  they would have immediately been labelled racist or sexist. And thus the
  picture has become increasingly clouded. Add to this the increasingly vexing
  question of U.S. hegemony, and the problems are compounded. Why should
  an anthology of cutting-edge poetry in English omit Australian and New
  Zealand poetry? Why Canadian, as was the case in Silliman's <I>In the American
  Tree</I>, and which continues to be the case in Hoover's and Weinberger's
  anthologies, though happily not in Messerli's. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#20" target="resource window">20</A>)</FONT> Why not poetry in English written in Africa and India?
  And notice that I haven't even mentioned the United Kingdom.</P>
  <P>How should avant-garde anthologists respond to this situation? Here
  I am of two minds. On the one hand, I am personally delighted that in the
  past two years alone, there have been so many anthologies of alternate
  poetries, that the readers &quot;out there&quot; have finally been forced
  to recognize the existence of Rosmarie Waldrop and Rae Armantrout, Bruce
  Andrews and Bob Perelman, Steve McCaffery and Nathaniel Mackey. I am gratified
  that we now have an anthology of post-language poets (from Oblek) and that
  Dennis Barone and Peter Ganick have anthologized forty-five younger or
  marginalized poets who were excluded from Ron Silliman's <I>In the American
  Tree</I> and Messerli's <I>'Language' Poetries</I>-- poets who include
  Joan Retallack, Leslie Scalapino, Kathleen Fraser, Hank Lazer, John Taggart,
  as well as such younger Canadian avant-garde poets as Karen Mac Cormack
  and Jeff Derksen. And I am eagerly looking forward to the monumental <I>Poems
  of the Millenium</I>, published, after all, not by an impoverished small
  press but by the University of California. </P>
  <P>At the same time, I wish the anthologies I have been discussing had
  been less extravagant in their claims to represent <I>the</I> important
  or <I>the</I> cutting-edge poetry of the day. For in making such claims,
  the editors open themselves up to the sort of critique we have already
  witnessed in the case of John Yau's response to Eliot Weinberger. How &quot;radical,&quot;
  someone is sure to ask, is the ecological lyric of Gary Snyder really?
  Is he one of &quot;us&quot; while, say, Charles Simic is one of &quot;them,&quot;
  and if so, on what grounds? Or again, why is Ed Dorn, whose <I>Slinger</I>
  was something of an underground classic for the radical young of the seventies,
  left out by both Weinberger and Messerli? If &quot;aesthetic&quot; considerations
  govern these choices, the reader has a right to know what these are. And
  not just in generalities about authority and hegemony versus experimentation
  and innovation. </P>
  <P>Perhaps the best solution in the poetically overpopulated, hyped-up
  nineties is to lower the volume and to admit to a degree of provisionality.
  Consider, for example, Peter Gizzi's <I>Exact Change Yearbook No. 1: 1995</I>.
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#21" target="resource window">21</A>)</FONT> In appearance, this deluxe
  414-page book is not exactly modest: its elegant and extravant layout was
  executed by a team of production assistants and printed on glossy paper
  in Hong Kong, and it includes a CD of readings by twelve poets from Michael
  Palmer to Ted Berrigan. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#22" target="resource window">22</A>)</FONT> But
  despite its stylish (detractors will say commodified) coffee-table book
  appearance (Michael Palmer, the featured poet, is glamorously pictured
  on the book's orange, black and blue hard cover), the <I>Exact Change Yearbook</I>
  represents what is to my mind a breakthrough in the anthologizing of poetry.
  Let me explain.</P>
  <P>In their prefatory &quot;Publisher's Note,&quot;, Damon Krukowski and
  Naomi Yang (who doubles as the book's designer) write that they wanted
  to replace the now defunct New Directions annual by presenting &quot;a
  large miscellany of avant-garde work, both contemporary and historical,
  chosen less to represent a particular 'school,' and more in the spirit
  of learning what's out there.&quot; To this end, the publishers asked Peter
  Gizzi &quot;to help us find a range of contemporary work that draws on
  the tradition we publish in our books of Surrealist and other early twentieth-century
  experimentation. . . . To what came back we added work by Exact Change
  authors [Stein, Cage, de Chirico, Aragon], as well as a few other discoveries
  we were eager to share&quot; (EC 7).</P>
  <P>The obvious advantage a yearbook has over an anthology is that it doesn't
  have to provide &quot;coverage.&quot; The situation is fluid: if someone's
  not &quot;in&quot; --well, maybe he or she will be in <I>Exact Change</I>
  #2. The downside, of course, is that, as a yearbook, the volume can't claim
  to be &quot;definitive&quot; in any sense and is therefore unlikely to
  be a candidate for classroom adoption or even for the sort of large-scale
  reviewing the Norton, Marsilio, and Sun &amp; Moon anthologies have been
  receiving. But on balance, this may not be such a bad thing. The very notion
  of <I>the</I> Norton Anthology of X or Y or <I>the</I> view &quot;from
  the other side of the century&quot; would seem to go against our postmodern
  wish to avoid what John Cage called a &quot;polar situation.&quot; Why
  not, for that matter, given the rapidity with which textbooks now go in
  and out of print, &quot;adopt&quot; one textbook for 1996, and another
  the year after? </P>
  <P><I>Exact Change Yearbook No. </I>1, in any case, differs from all the
  &quot;New American Poetries&quot; I have been discussing in that it discards
  the exclusively national label without, on the other hand, becoming some
  sort of vapid World Reader. The book juxtaposes avant-garde poets and artists
  from the U.S. (ranging chronologically from the <I>Imaginary Elegies</I>
  of the late Jack Spicer, and Fanny Howe's presentation of extracts from
  John Wiener's very moving journal <I>707 Scott Street</I>, to a &quot;Gallery&quot;
  of younger largely unknown poets like Paul Beatty, Tory Dent, and Jennifer
  Moxley), with their counterparts abroad--specifically, in Britain, France,
  Germany, China, Russia--and, closer to home, the Caribbean and Canada.
  And as if these juxtapositions weren't enough, we can also read Clark Coolidge's
  prose poem &quot;Mary or Marie&quot; (a &quot;writing through&quot; of
  Jean-Luc Godard's film <I>Hail Mary</I>) or Susan Howe's 25-part sequence
  &quot;Chanting at the Crystal Sea&quot;(first published in 1975) against
  Gertrude Stein's <I>Before the Flowers of Friendship faded Friendship Faded</I>,
  which is printed for the first time (as Juliana Spahr explains in an excellent
  headnote), together with Stein's source text, Georges Hugnet's <I>Enfance</I>,
  exactly in the form they were originally published in the journal <I>Pagany</I>
  (1930). Or again, we can read Barbara Guest's lecture &quot;Poetry the
  True Fiction&quot; against Hugo Ball's &quot;Grand Hotel Metaphysics,&quot;
  the &quot;Radio Happenings&quot; of John Cage and Morton Feldman against
  Erik Satie's &quot;Dried Embryos,&quot; or Michael Palmer's &quot;Circular
  Gates&quot; and his &quot;Site of the Poem (An Impromptu for [Octavio]
  Paz)&quot; against Louis Aragon's &quot;Peasant's Dream&quot; or the &quot;Fragments&quot;
  of De Chirico. </P>
  <P>Such collaging is not to be confused with what I have called the &quot;buttressing
  and belatedness&quot; of the new blockbuster anthologies. For the effect
  of reading the contemporary works in the <I>Yearbook </I>against particular
  Dada and Surrealist counterparts is to emphasize difference at least as
  much as similarity. The editor is not establishing a tradition or line
  of poets. At the same time, the geographical range of the new work presented
  gives, at least me, a sense of--forgive the taboo word--transcendence.
  For instead of the usual anthology wars (who's in, who's out, which editor
  is sufficiently multicultural?) the <I>Exact Change Yearbook</I> offers
  the most convincing evidence I've seen to date that our own radical poetries
  are not some kind of local aberration, spawned by a bunch of theory-crazed,
  left-wing poets in New York and San Francisco, and perpetrated by <I>les
  jeunes</I> at Buffalo and other out-of-the way stations--poetries, so the
  mainstream would have it, to be ignored as thoroughly as possible by the
  various prize-giving foundations as well as most of the elite universities
  including my own. Indeed, what Gizzi's juxtapositions of U.S. and foreign
  portfolios suggest is that the attention to the materiality of language,
  to syntactic disjunction and visual constellation, so central to the language
  poetries in Messerli and Hoover's anthologies, and especially the attention
  to the reconfiguration of lyric as speaking, once again, not only for the
  &quot;sensitive&quot; and &quot;authentic&quot; individual (&quot;Here's
  what I, Mary Smith, realized yesterday, as I was weeding the garden&quot;)
  but for the larger cultural and philosophical moment--that all these are
  now characteristic of poetries produced around the globe.</P>
  <P>Take Jeff Twitchell's portfolio of the &quot;Original Chinese Language
  Group.&quot; As Twitchell explains, &quot;Original, not in the sense of
  unique, but because of their interest in the earlier meanings and associations
  that can be read in the Chinese written character. . . .So, too, the recuperation
  of the original impetus of poetry as the play in language&quot; (EC 20).
  The &quot;Original Poets,&quot; Twitchell explains, go beyond their predecessors,
  the so-called &quot;Misty&quot; (because branded &quot;obscure&quot; by
  the official critics) poets of the late 1970s, of whom the best known in
  the U.S. is Bei Dao. The 1988 &quot;Original&quot; Manifesto, reproduced
  here, comes out strongly against the localism, ethnocentrism, and nationalism
  that bedevilled Communist China until quite recently. The aim is to make
  contact with &quot;modern Western art,&quot; and the vehicle for such contact,
  the manifesto declares, is the written character, which, compared to spoken
  language, is &quot;less polluted and pre-judged&quot; &quot;We do not avoid,&quot;
  they declare, &quot;the phrase 'word games' which already has aroused great
  misunderstanding. We even like it. &quot;Game&quot; [<I>y&oacute;uxi</I>]
  is a word, connoting the profound, eerie spirit of art and philosophy&quot;
  (EC 36). And the text gives way to the visual image of a large black cross
  which represents the intersection of &quot;swim&quot; [y&oacute;u]--to
  get in touch with reality-- and &quot;play&quot; [<I>x&igrave;</I>]. </P>
  <P>Twichell's portfolio is taken from the selection that appeared in the
  British journal <I>Parataxis</I> (#7, 1994) . edited by the poet Drew Milne.
  In translation, the poems themselves--by Che Quian-Zi, Zhou Ya-Ping, Yi
  Cun, Huang Gan, Xian Meng, and Hong Liu (the one woman in this group)--don't
  quite live up to that manifesto. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="anth_footnotes.html#23" target="resource window">23</A>)</FONT>
  &quot;Word games,&quot; in the sense of Steve McCaffery's or Joan Retallack's
  paragrammatic play, are less common than neo-Surrealist imagery and the
  casting of a sharp eye on the &quot;direct treatment of the thing,&quot;
  in the Poundian Imagist sense. Just as Pound's fabled &quot;invention of
  China&quot; turns out to have little to do with the classical Chinese models
  which were his source, so the Original Poets's version of &quot;language
  poetry&quot; is more graphic and precisionist than, say, Charles Bernstein's
  or Bob Perelman's. Here, for example, is Part III of Zhou Ya-Ping's &quot;Vulgar
  Beauty&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>An afterbirth is unfolded, taking the shape of an umbrella.</P>
    <P>The ridges of an umbrella along yellow lines.</P>
    <P>A fetus like a coal cinder has long been reared in it,</P>
    <P>Lit by me, it will give off light.</P>
    <P>A white crane, unexpectedly covered by a black string-net</P>
    <P>A snake, bound with a copper wire, body</P>
    <P>Like a tightening spring, soft parts flashing. (EC 25)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>We must remember that in the Chinese, as J. H.Prynne notes in an Afterword
  that is itself a kind of prose poem, the &quot;iconic deployment [of the
  language] by stroke play and contexture makes a traffic with the eye worked
  by a different ground-plan&quot; (EC 39). At one point, the translators
  planned to include some of the Chinese text so as to show how the tactile
  element works, but the Originals themselves countered this idea because,
  as Prynne puts it, &quot;it would suggest exoticism or extraneous willow-pattern
  ornament; to them, we are the exotics, with our credit-card view of the
  speech act&quot; (EC 39).</P>
  <P>The Russian portfolio, edited by Edward Foster and drawn from the conference
  called &quot;The New Freedom,&quot; which Foster organized at the Stevens
  Institute of Technology in April, 1994, raises similar issues. Arkadii
  Dragomoshchenko, even in the brilliantly austere translations of Lyn Hejinian,
  is, like Alexei Parshchikov and Aleksandr Eremenko, given to hyperbole
  and extravagant conceit, to manic, gargantuan, highly sensuous catalogues
  of images rather than to the abstraction and citation we find in its U.S.
  counterparts. At the same time, as locutions like &quot;false, foil-like
  grounds of gender&quot; suggest, Dragomoschenko has obviously learned a
  lot from his translator's own brand of verbal play:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>I like to provoke the sensation of the thin, undependable, somehow false,
    foil-like grounds of gender, bearing within itself a sleepy illusion of
    the laws of gravity, as if governed by my movements in the unconfining
    limits of gravitations and diversions of space. And when, in a radiant
    eclipse at the inevitable reunion with earth, at the increasing of masses
    and the sweetest, strawberry creamlike terror of children, consciousness
    takes on the transparency of compressed time, the theory of free fall blossoms
    with fresh oxides on the lips, past which the wind carries us. . . (<I>Phosphor</I>,
    EC 145).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>But perhaps the most surprising of the portfolios--surprising, that
  is, for a U.S. audience accustomed to the British anthologies put out by
  Oxford or Penguin or even Bloodaxe, is Tom Raworth's &quot;Anglo-Irish
  Alternative.&quot; So used are we to the &quot;gentility&quot; of the contemporary
  British verse we read in <I>Grand Street</I> or <I>PN Review</I>, that
  the opening of the first poem in Raworth's portfolio, Denise Riley's &quot;Burnt&quot;--</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>And then my ears get full of someone's teeth again</P>
    <P>As someone's tongue</P>
    <P></P>
    <P>as brown and flexible as a young giraffe's</P>
    <P>rasps all round someone else's story-- (EC 317)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>is startling in its refusal to pretty things up, to get the erotic scene
  that follows exactly &quot;right.&quot; In the headnote, Raworth remarks
  that what unites his fourteen poets--among them, Catherine Walsh, D. S.
  Marriott, , Iliassa Sequin, Ken Edwards, Maurice Scully, Lee Harwood, Wendy
  Mulford, Ulli Freer, Anthony Mellors, and Raworth himself (Prynne being
  included with the entire &quot;Bands Around the Throat&quot; in the &quot;Three
  Chapbooks&quot; section, along with Beverly Dahlen and Susan Howe)-- is
  a &quot;common distaste for what is still passed off as British poetry
  . . . the Hughes, Heaney, Harrison axis--the &quot;New Generation&quot;
  poets marketed like sportswear . . . the terrible drabness of Larkin (whom
  I imagine wrote 'They tuck you up / your mum and dad' and then rode the
  wave of a typo)&quot; (EC 315-16). Here, as in Prynne's satiric demolition
  of the &quot;credit-card view of the speech act,&quot; one has the sense
  that, after years of Drab Age verse, <I>fun</I> is once again part of the
  British poetry scene. And that sense is confirmed by Lee Harwood's superb
  rendition of Joseph Cornell's box-making in the set of fifty fragments
  called &quot;Days and Nights: Accidental Sightings&quot; (EC 331-33).</P>
  <P>&quot;Vortex,&quot; the bard said, &quot;is energy!&quot; We are, as
  the <I>Yearbook</I> makes abundantly clear, living in a great and varied
  moment for poetry. Rosmarie Waldrop's &quot;Berlin(plus) Portfolio,&quot;
  for example, is absolutely startling in its presentation of East and West
  German poets, poets not always amicably related, but writing an explosive,
  daring, and sardonic lyric that gives our own language poetics a purposely
  nasty spin, rather like putting a George Grosz cartoon on top of a Jasper
  Johns drawing. The &quot;Canadian Emergency&quot; section, edited by Steve
  Evans and &quot;From the Anglophone Caribbean&quot; (edited by Mark McMorris)
  deserve an essay of their own: the relations of McMorris's poets to a Francophone
  Caribbean poet like Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire, for example (or, for that
  matter, to the U.S. poet Clayton Eshleman) deserve to be studied. But space
  forbids me to do so here, even as I can't dwell on Cole Swensen's &quot;Ecriture
  fran&ccedil;aise,&quot; a fine selection from the work, somewhat better
  known to U.S. readers than the other poetries discussed here, of Anne-Marie
  Albiach, Emmanuel Hocquard, Claude Royet-Journoud, Dominique Fourcade,
  and a number of others-- poets closely associated with Michael Palmer and
  Michael Davidson. </P>
  <P><I>Exact Change Yearbook No. 1: 1995</I> has no mission statement, no
  textbook introduction of what postmodern poetry is or isn't. But the juxtapositions
  I have been describing--the kinds of Berlin or Beijing poems that are placed
  side by side with the Michael Palmer feature and the three chapbooks of
  Jeremy Prynne, Beverly Dahlen, and Susan Howe, say it all obliquely. Like
  the Weinberger, Hoover, and Messerli anthologies, which intersect with
  <I>Exact Change</I> in so many fruitful ways, Gizzi's anthology implies
  that, whatever the local and topical importance of such celebrated U.S.
  poets as Adrienne Rich and W. S. Merwin, Robert Hass and Edward Hirsch,
  the real action today is elsewhere. Many readers, of course, will disagree,
  but the whole conception of the <I>Yearbook</I> makes it difficult for
  them to play the &quot;where is X?&quot; game or to express indignation
  that those included are <I>not</I> after all the significant postmoderns.</P>
  <P>Does this make the <I>Exact Change Yearbook</I> the heir of Donald Allen's
  <I>New American Poetry</I>? Not at all, and that's precisely the point.
  An &quot;Anthology beginning 'The,'&quot; to paraphrase Zukofsky's lovely
  title, no longer seems to be what we need. And that, paradoxically makes
  the project of producing an anthology all the more challenging. <BR>
