<P>
 The job crisis for English and Comparative
Literature PhDs is now a fact of life, but thus far responses
to that crisis, as published in various professional journals,
have been, at best, cosmetic.  They fall into roughly four categories:
<P>
(1) <I>Denial</I>.  Things, we hear
especially from Modern Language Association (MLA) officials, are
not really <I>that</I> bad 
 Why, this year there were forty more
jobs advertised than last!  And besides, why must PhDs in English
necessarily teach?  Look at the good jobs in Silicon Valley. 
What these officials don't say is that the &quot;new&quot; academic
jobs are almost invariably at shaky institutions in out-of-the
way places or possibly in Singapore!  And, yes, designing software
and websites can be very exciting but does one really need to
have spent eight years getting a PhD in English in order to qualify?
<P>
(2) <I>Doom and Gloom</I>.  In the
MLA journal <I>Profession 1996</I>,  J. Hillis Miller (Distinguished
Professor of English and Comparative Literature, UC Irvine) writes
movingly about the demise of the great research university, as
built on the German model devised by Wilhelm von Humboldt in the
early nineteenth century, a model that has &quot;lasted until
quite recently, at least as an ideal, in the United States.  It
is now rapidly coming to an end.&quot;  &quot;What possible role.&quot;
asks Miller, &quot;can literary study have in the new &quot;technological
transnational university&quot; with its  &quot;business-world
model of productivity&quot;?  All we can do, he concludes sadly,
 is &quot;to take stock&quot; and &quot;to think out ways to justify
what we do in the humanities.&quot;
<P>
(3)  <I>The &quot;How To&quot; Model</I>.
  In the most recent <I>ADE [Associated Departments of English]
Bulletin</I> (Winter 1996), a number of department chairs
and deans give practical advice as to how to hold on to faculty
budget lines or squeeze new ones out of recalcitrant administrators.
 How-Toers have oddly adopted the language of corporate management.
 Thus Carol Christ (Vice Chancellor and Provost, UC-Berkeley)
writes, &quot;Another way to maximize leverage for faculty positions
is to build on partnerships,&quot; and she questions the value
of excessive &quot;investment&quot; in graduate programs.  And
Suzanne Gossett (former Chair of the English department, Loyola
University, Chicago) suggests that members of a department who
want, to hire, say, a nineteenth-century specialist, are more
likely to get a budget line if  &quot;they are shrewd enough to
ask for someone working in gender studies or cultural studies
or the new historicism.&quot;
<P>
(4)  <I>Storming the Barricades</I>.
 In a number of provocative articles in <I>Academe</I>,
<I>Profession</I>, and <I>Social Change, </I>Cary
Nelson (Jubilee Professor of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) has argued that graduate students
are now the exploited class; in English, for example, they do
a large amount of the departmental teaching for miserably small
salaries and miserable future job prospects.  They often have
no benefits and no protection.  Nelson's solution:  students must
unionize, they must form political action committees, they must
attack the MLA and their own university administrations, and the
MLA itself must have a new governing structure so it can lobby
effectively with state and federal legislators.  For Nelson and
like-minded radical colleagues, the student movement is the heir
to the labor movement of the thirties, and the watchword is &quot;Strike!&quot;
<P>
 I have a good deal of sympathy for Nelson's
position, challenging, as it does, the large-scale inertia of
the profession.  But, practically speaking, Nelson and his colleagues
are whistling in the dark.  As recents statistics in the <I>Chronicle</I>
remind us,in 1996 prospective English majors constitute less than
2% of entering freshmen. Graduate programs around the country
are an endangered species.   The idea, then, that legislators
will respond to lobbying by the President or other officers of
the MLA is wonderfully absurd.  If, moreover, graduate students
refuse to teach their sections, those same legislators will hire
even more part-timers or, in the new cyber-university, will institute
computer courses in Freshman Composition that require no live
instructors at all.
<P>
 Indeed, what I find troubling about all
of the above &quot;solutions&quot; is their tacit assumption that
what we're currently doing <I>is</I> <I>ipso facto</I>
<I>valuable</I>, and so we need only convince &quot;them&quot;
(hostile legislators, right-wing operatives, technocrats, media
representatives) to give it financial support.   Accordingly,
when Cary Nelson takes up the cause of the oppressed graduate
student, he never asks what I take to be the central question
in this whole discussion:  what is it that graduate students (or
their professors) teach and who needs it?  What, in other words,
is the rationale for our discipline today?  What is its<I>
urgency</I>?  And why <I>should</I> the taxpayer support
us?
<P>
 My own sense is that the time has come to
stop blaming &quot;them&quot; and start taking some of the blame
ourselves. &quot;Reagan-Bush&quot; is too easy a target (especially
now that a Democratic president who claims to care deeply about
education has been in office for more than four years!), and so
is transnational capital.  Rather, it's time to ask why, say,
the citizens of California, who once cared a great deal about
the strength of higher education, are now so apathetic, especially
about what we do in the Humanities.  And <I>why</I>, in
response to this apathy, do administrators transfer budget lines
from English to Engineering or Economics?  
<P>
 It is not enough to say that citizens and
educators are motivated by mere greed, that they want undergraduates
to learn only practical subjects that lead directly to jobs and
hence care nothing for those who teach in the Humanities.  For
when did an English or Comparative Literature major ever lead
to a specific job?  No, I think the public is fed up with the
contentless curriculum of current literature programs.  There
is a strong sense that these programs don't teach a particular
or coherent body of knowledge and hence are expendable.  And there
is surely something to this critique.
<P>
 Enrollment in advanced courses in Economics
(e.g., International Trade Theory, Public Finance and Taxation,
or Econometrics) is invariably contingent upon successful completion
of an introductory course in Economic Principles.   The supposition
is that the basics must be mastered before one can proceed.  The
same holds true for Mathematics, Psychology, the Biological and
Physical Sciences, and Engineering.  Philosophy and History have
various prerequisites.  But English Literature?   In our &quot;discipline,&quot;
there are either no requirements except numerical ones (so and
so many courses), or, as is the case at Stanford, we pay lip service
to outmoded notions of &quot;coverage&quot; and canonicity.  I
say outmoded because the coverage of the various historical periods
and areas assures nothing except that a sizable number of books
will be somehow &quot;read,&quot; and read, moreover, in any order
the student chooses.  &quot;Taking&quot; a course in Shakespeare
or Milton or even Virginia Woolf may not mean what conservative
advocates like Lynn Cheney or William Bennett think it does.
<P>
 For what is &quot;reading&quot; anyway?
  If we judge by the scholarly articles and books English professors
are currently publishing, the theory-of-the-day (and this inevitably
has a trickle-down effect in the undergraduate classroom) is a
form of cultural unmasking and exposure we might call &quot;Gotcha!&quot;
&quot;Gotcha,&quot; the professor demonstrates, &quot;you thought
Emily Dickinson was a brilliant feminist poet, but you know what?
 She was motivated by class interests as can be seen in her lack
of concern for factory women!&quot;   Or-- gotcha!--the first
edition of James Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>, long thought to
be a subversive masterpiece, was purposely priced out of the reach
of the common reader-- a case of collusion, if ever there was
one, between author, bookseller, and capitalist investor.   Again,
the main interest of <I>Heart of Darkness</I>-- gotcha!--
is that it exposes Joseph Conrad as the imperialist and colonialist
he really was!   As for that so-called avant-gardist Gertrude
Stein--gotcha!&quot;--did you know that in old age she was ready
to collaborate with the proto-Nazi P&eacute;tain government?
<P>
 What are undergraduates, especially the
98% who are not majors and may never take another English course,
supposed to do with these bits of  information, all of which come,
by the way, from actual articles recently published in prestigious
journals?  Since they were not around when Conrad was taught as
something other than a colonialist or racist, or when, in the
case of <I>Ulysses</I>,  the Homeric parallels. symbolist
leitmotifs, and rhetorical devices were the object of study, and
since they have probably never studied nineteenth-century American
history  or Victorian and Edwardian politics, much less the situation
in Occupied France in the early 1940s, the literary &quot;revelations&quot;
in question suggest nothing so much as that the works in question
are too objectionable to be worth studying in the first place.
<P>
 What should be taught rather than this meaningless
identity politics model, which will, in any case, be replaced
in a few years by other models, even as it has replaced earlier
movements from the New Criticism to the New Historicism,  is literary
literacy.  If you don't believe there is such a thing, think of
visual or musical literacy.  I know how difficult it must be to
attain the latter because I don't have it: I cannot discuss a
piece of music in any analytic or critical way, although of course
&quot;I know what I like.&quot;  The notion that everyone can
read literature just because he or she knows how to read, is,
I think, the fallacy that has gotten us where we are (or rather,
are not) at the present moment.  
<P>
 My prerequiste course or courses would allow
instructors to use whatever literary texts they find most congenial,
 the more complex and open to interpretation the better, so as
to have their students think about basic literary problems.  What
is a narrative anyway?    When and why is narrative more effective
than exposition?   What is a line break and how does lineated
writing, otherwise known as poetry,  differ from writing all the
way to the right margin?  How does one know when the words of
a first-person speaker in a given poem are ironic?  How are time
and space represented in language?  Why don't Western poets write
epics any more, and what do we make of the resurgence of epic
in the literature of emergent nations?   And, most important,
what is the relationship of literature to life?  Are they equivalent?
Must literature be &quot;realistic&quot;?  And, by the way, what
is realism?  The openness of that particular question was brought
home to me recently when a professor objected to the &quot;blindness&quot;
of a set of sequential photographs of automobile culture along
the Los Angeles boulevards made by the artist Robbert Flick on
the grounds that &quot;There are more people on Pico than he shows!
 Unless of course he shot those pictures at 6 A.M.!&quot;  Is
the artist's role, I asked the questioner,  to present a given
scene &quot;accurately&quot;?   And &quot;accurately&quot; according
to whom?
<P>
 Choosing appropriate texts for the introductory
course I am describing is by no means equivalent to &quot;anything
goes.&quot;  On the contrary.  One can't exactly discuss the meaning
of epic without reading some epics, but I would not prescribe
which epic must be read.  Or again, the question of &quot;realism&quot;
with its corollary that &quot;realism&quot; is a convention like
any other, insures that the instructor will choose a representative
example:  say, a novella by Chekhov or novel by George Eliot,
perhaps vis-a-vis some &quot;hyperreal&quot; fiction being written
today.  Again, the analysis of time and space in the novel won't
get very far if the work in question is a standard pop novel,
selected for its &quot;relevant&quot; subject matter but indifferent
to questions of language and form.  And the analysis of line breaks
quickly teaches students how much skill it takes--has always taken--to
create a poetic structure.
<P>
 The <I>what</I>, in other words,
doesn't matter nearly as much as the <I>how</I>. This is
why the canon wars of the 1980s have proved to be such a colossal
distraction.  For even as we have endlessly  debated what authors
to read or not to read in a given course, we have rarely discussed
what &quot;reading&quot; is or does.  If a stiff course on the
practice of reading and writing-- known, once upon a time, as
rhetoric-- were the prerequisite for all further work in the English
Department, there would, I believe, be much more interest in our
discipline.  &quot;Creative Reading,&quot; as Charles Bernstein
has dubbed it in his SUNY-Buffalo poetry courses, is a discipline
that can be taught even though there will be much disagreement
as to particulars.   I have never, in any case, met a student
who wasn't interested in the basic questions I pose above.   And
students who, for example,  go on to law school regularly tell
me that studying literary literacy has helped them immeasurably
in reading legal briefs and weighing evidence.
<P>
 I believe the citizens of my state, California,
would be much more inclined to vote funds for the Humanities if
they felt their children were accumulating such cultural capital.
 As for the Humbolditian research university Hillis Miller mourns,
it may well be that the German model has had its day.   That model,
after all, was based on a definable corpus of Classical and European
literature.  Add to that corpus three centuries of American literature,
as well as the burgeoning literatures of other nations (beginning
with other English-speaking nations like Australia and Canada!),
and it becomes clear that no one can &quot;cover&quot; the field
of &quot;English Literature,&quot; much less of literature in
general.  Accordingly, once the student has completed the basic
prerequiste course or courses, choices should be flexible and
custom-made.  If student X is writing an honors thesis on Eliot
and Pound, a course on Dante will be more useful than one on <I>Piers
Plowman</I>.  Indeed, it may even be that the study of a new
&quot;cutting edge&quot; field like video art (an amalgam of the
visual, verbal, and aural) may be more challenging for a given
student than, say, a course in the fiction of Victorian England,
even when that fiction is dressed up as a branch of Feminist Studies
or Postcolonial Theory so as to be &quot;relevant.&quot; The study
of specific literatures comes and goes, the biggest coming we
have seen in recent years being that of African-American literature,
now one of the most interesting sites for questions about narrative,
oral transmission, and the problems of realism.  
<P>
 But what will never go away, even if we
cannot define its exact parameters, is a passion for <I>literature
</I> itself.  Indeed, the drive to produce as well as to understand
the various literary forms cannot be squelched. From discussion
groups on the World Wide Web to adult reading groups in every
small town in the U.S., from the growing number of poetry cafes
to informal theatre groups, people are expressing a desire to
read, with a measure of understanding, the great literary works.
 If we could draw even a fraction of these people back into the
classroom, we would have plenty of students and hence, in the
long run, a demand for plenty of professors.  It is the <I>will</I>,
not the funding, that is currently lacking.
