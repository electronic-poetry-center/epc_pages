<P>
 When <I>Frank O'Hara: Poet Among Painters</I> was published
twenty years ago, O'Hara was a coterie figure, adored by his New
York School friends and acolytes, especially by the painters whose
work he exhibited and wrote about--but otherwise regarded (when
regarded at all) as a charming minor poet.  Herbert Leibowitz,
in a largely generous review of O'Hara's <I>Collected Poems</I>
for the <I>New York Times Book Review</I> in 1971, called
O'Hara &quot;an aesthetic courtier who had taste and impudence
and prodigious energy.&quot;<SUP> </SUP>   Even the avant-garde
poet/novelist Gilbert Sorrentino, whose New York literary world
intersected with O'Hara's through the mediation of Amiri Baraka
(then LeRoi Jones) and his magazine <I>Yugen</I>, described
<I>Lunch Poems</I> as &quot;mov[ing] in a  world of wry
elegance, of gesture, a world made up of a certain kind of strictly
New York <I>joie de vivre</I>: slightly down at heels and
rumpled, but with the kind of style always a step above current
'style'.&quot;<SUP> </SUP>
<P>
 What is not said in these or the other reviews of O'Hara's poetry
in the late sixties and seventies is that the &quot;style&quot;
to which Sorrentino draws our attention was a style recognizably
gay.   Indeed, neither in the moving memorial essays by John Ashbery
or Kenneth Koch nor in the many critiques, from Francis Hope's
dismissal of the &quot;puppyish charm of [O'Hara's] occasional
good impromptus,&quot; to Marius Bewley's bemused characterization
of the poet's &quot;long invertebrate verse lines&quot; as so
many &quot;streamers of crepe paper fluttering before an electric
fan,&quot; is direct reference made to the poet's homosexuality.
  When, for example, Thomas Byrom reviewed my book, along with
O'Hara's <I>Early Writing</I> and <I>Poems Retrieved</I>,
in the <I>Times Literary </I>Supplement, he characterized
O'Hara as follows:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>His aesthetics are from a catalogue of late Victorian
camp, a matter of excellent personal taste.  He burned hard and
gemlike; he drank and talked volubly.  Though he tried on later
ideologies, the one he lived was a sociable and less frigid version
of Paterian pop, and the one he wrote was a subjective impressionism.
 His syntax has little of the crafty or inspired appositiveness
of the Surrealist; it is an articulation of mental chatter and
drift, and his style depends for its success wholly on his sensibility.
 Perhaps he is most like e. e. cummings, the same soft verve,
a sentimental eroticism, a certain heart. . . . Casualness, quickness,
openness were what he wanted and often got.<BR>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&quot;Late Victorian camp,&quot; &quot;Paterian pop.&quot; &quot;mental
chatter and drift&quot;-- twenty years later we recognize these
as code terms for &quot;queer.&quot;  But at the time I read Byrom's
review, (which suggested it was bad form on my part to take this
playful poet seriously!),  I myself wasn't aware to what extent
critiques of O'Hara's &quot;gifts for buoyancy, spontaneity and
fun&quot; (Byrom, <I>TLS,</I> 78), were, consciously or
not, critiques of a poetic that generated lines like &quot;Even
trees understand me!  Good heavens, I lie under them too, don't
I?&quot; (CP 196), or &quot;you were made in the image of god
/ I was not / I was made in the image of a sissy truck-driver&quot;
(<I>CP</I>, 338).    Even in the later 1970s, readers didn't
quite know how to respond to such self-exposure.  When, in an
early draft of <I>Frank O'Hara: Poet Among Painters</I><I>,</I>
I referred to Joe LeSueur as Frank's lover,  Donald Allen suggested
tactfully that I use the word &quot;friend&quot; instead.  &quot;O'Hara,&quot;
wrote Kenneth Koch in his admiring review of the <I>Collected
Poems</I>, &quot;had an unusual gift for friendship and for
love.&quot;   And it is similarly friendship and a shared aesthetic
that are central to John Ashbery's moving account, in his introduction
to the <I>Collected Poems</I>,  of Frank's invention of
a &quot;vernacular corresponding to the creatively messy New York
environment,&quot; with its &quot;scent of garbage, patchouli
and carbon monoxide&quot; (see CP x).  
<P>
 I remind the reader of these conventions of the seventies so
as to provide the context for my own historical/critical study
of O'Hara's work, a study largely devoid of speculation on the
role gender played in O'Hara's oppositionality.  That he was a
radical and &quot;different&quot; poet was my premise, but I regarded
that oppositionality (to the aesthetic, not only of Robert Lowell,
which he criticized openly, but also that of the then counterculture
hero, Charles Olson), as a question of individual ethos rather
than as, in any profound way, constructed by the poet's culture
or sexual identification.  Along the same lines, I paid little
attention to the roles race and ethnicity play in poems like &quot;Ode:
 Salute to the French Negro Poets&quot;--the heady mix of exoticism,
curiosity, and egalitarianism with which O'Hara celebrated &quot;the
love we bear each other's differences / in race which is the poetic
ground on which we rear our smiles&quot; (CP 305), and that prompted
the poet to remark on the &quot;Puerto Ricans on the avenue today,
which / makes it beautiful and warm&quot; (CP 258).  
<P>
 In 1977, the age demanded a raison d'&ecirc;tre for O'Hara's
casual, improvisatory, nonmetrical and generally nonstanzaic &quot;I
do this, I do that&quot; pieces, pieces that hardly seemed to
qualify as <I>poems</I> at all.  Hence my attention to
poetic lineage (from Williams, from Mayakovsky, from Apollinaire),
generic placement (ode? elegy? occasional poem?), and technical
device (especially the daring use of line-break).  It was important,
I felt, to expose an audience accustomed to the well-made ironic
lyric of Richard Wilbur on the one hand and the oracular, densely
allusive &quot;projective verse&quot; of Olson on the other, to
the very different &quot;aesthetic of attention&quot; that is
O'Hara's special signature.  The impact of culture and sexuality
on that aesthetic was undoubtedly underestimated.
<P>
 How different is the situation today?  In one sense, we have
witnessed a total turnaround.  The first O'Hara biography, Brad
Gooch's <I>City Poet:  The Life and Times of Frank O'Hara </I>(1993),
is nothing if not candid about the poet's love affairs and one-night
stands--so candid, in fact, that, after some valuable chapters
on the poet's childhood, navy days, and Harvard years, it becomes
an extended (some would say, excessive) portrait of what it was
to burn with a hard gem-like flame in the postwar and pre-AIDS
decades.   The new respectability of Queer Theory, coupled with
the breakdown of the High Culture / Popular Culture divide, and
the tolerance, even in the Academy, for open forms and improvisatory
discourse-- these have given O'Hara a new place in the canon.
  He is, for example, included in the most recent edition of the
<I>Norton Anthology of American Literature</I> (1989) as
well as in Helen Vendler's controversial <I>Harvard Book of
Contemporary American Poetry</I> (1985).  In each of these,
O'Hara gets considerably less space than Robert Lowell or Adrienne
Rich or even Allen Ginsberg, but he does get pride of place in
three recent large avant-garde anthologies-- Eliot Weinberger's
<I>American Poetry since </I>1950 (Marsilio, 1993), Paul
Hoover's <I>Postmodern American Poetry</I> (Norton, 1994),
and Douglas Messerli's <I>From the Other Side of the Century:
 A New American Poetry 1960-1990</I> (Sun &amp; Moon, 1994).
By 1995, when the <I>Collected Poems</I>, edited by Donald
Allen, was reprinted by the University of California Press,  it
was safe to say that any treatment of midcentury American poetry
would have to take Frank O'Hara into account.
<P>
 Indeed, at a conference on &quot;Poetry of the 1950s&quot; held
at the University of Maine at Orono in June 1996,  there were
more papers (eleven in all) on O'Hara than on any other single
poet, and his name cropped up repeatedly in the various keynote
addresses on larger topics.   Ten years ago, I would guess, the
central figure of such a conference, held as it was in Ezra Pound
country, would have been Charles Olson.  But at the fin-de-si&egrave;cle,
there seems to be a decided shift in sensibility.
<P>
And not just a turn to gay sensibility as such, since the speakers
focused on such varied topics as the effect of the Cold War on
O'Hara's curatorial activities at the Museum of Modern Art, the
relationship of his poetry to the film culture of the fifties,
the crossing of camp and sublimity in the late poem &quot;Biotherm,&quot;
and the particular brand of &quot;liberation politics&quot; that
links &quot;Meditations in an Emergency&quot; to the &quot;emergence&quot;
of formerly subjugated groups.
<P>
 Thirty years after his death, O'Hara's poetic has thus come of
age. But gratifying as this interest is, we must now be careful
not to turn this mercurial and highly individual poet into a mere
representative of fifties' queer sensibility or Cold War politics.
 In a recent essay for <I>American Literary History</I>,
for example, Caleb Crain examines what he takes to be O'Hara's
deep-seated aggression--an aggression that doubles back upon itself
since, in the &quot;regime of homophobia&quot; of the &quot;pre-gay
liberation 1950s,&quot; it cannot direct itself outward-- through
the lens of D. W. Winnicott's object-relations psychology.   One
needs such an explanatory mechanism, we are told, because, taken
in themselves, the &quot;constitutent elements [of the poems]
can seem trivial, and their structure as cavalier and casual as
telephone gossip or lunch conversation. . . The poems' elements
do not seem amenable to analysis and a new synthesis in the classroom.&quot;

<P>
 But the &quot;aggression&quot; Crain is at such pains to account
for (its exemplar is the wonderfully absurd reference in &quot;Personism:
A Manifesto,&quot; to &quot;someone chasing you down the street
with a knife&quot;) is taken to be a given of the poetry rather
than shown to be present in its actual fabric. And that fabric,
the materiality of the poems, is judged to be &quot;cavalier,&quot;
&quot;casual&quot; and &quot;trivial,&quot;-- a poetic structure
not &quot;amenable to analysis,&quot; at least not without an
external key like Winnicott's psychiatric theory.  Ironically
enough, such assessment echoes that of O'Hara's early detractors:
 in &quot;Personal Poem,&quot; for example, the poet, according
to Crain, &quot;bobs along on a buoyant gush of detail,&quot;
and &quot;an outsider might not 'get' the story behind this glib,
chatty, undirected monologue&quot; (ALH 301-302). Indeed, the
poem's &quot;laundry list&quot; is redeemed only by the poem's
conclusion, which reveals it as a love poem:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  back to work happy at the thought possibly so 
  (CP 336)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Crain comments, &quot;The happiness that surfaces at the close
sheds light backward through the poem, connecting the random narrative
into pillow talk, lovers' gossip at the end of the day.  Like
baby booties memorialized in bronze, O'Hara's trivial day is electroplated
with the charge of knowing he is loved&quot;  (ALH 302).
<P>
 This reading smooths out the poem's tensions,  missing the force
of the poignantly tentative &quot;possibly so&quot; of the last
line.  Indeed, despite the external evidence that &quot;Personal
Poem&quot; was written for O'Hara's then-lover Vincent Warren,
 its narrative, far from being &quot;glib&quot; and &quot;chatty,&quot;
begins on a note of thinly veiled anxiety:
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Now when I walk around at lunchtime</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  I have only two charms in my pocket</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  an old Roman coin Mike Kanemitsu gave me</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2></BLOCKQUOTE>  when I was in Madrid     (<I>CP</I>, 335)
<BR>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>Some good luck charms! The poet works hard to cheer himself
up:  he puns on the &quot;luminous humidity&quot; of the recently
completed &quot;House of Seagram with its wet,&quot; and enjoys,
as in &quot;A Step Away from Them,&quot; the sight of construction
workers on girders, especially when they are wearing silver hats.
 But once inside the pub, the anxiety comes back:
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>   I wait for</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  shaker the last five years my batting average </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  is.016 that's that</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
LeRoi's news that &quot;Miles Davis was clubbed 12 / times last
night outside BIRDLAND by a cop&quot; (terrifying news for the
gay speaker as well as his  black friend, given the raids on gay
bars so frequent in these years) doesn't exactly help.  Never
mind: it's the hour of friendship and so the two poets, exchange
mutual antiestablishment sentiments--&quot;we don't like Lionel
Trilling / we decide, we like Don Allen we don't like / Henry
James so much we like Herman Melville&quot;).   But how close
are &quot;we&quot; really?   It is at the moment of saying goodbye
to LeRoi that Frank wonders &quot;if one person out of the 8,000,000
is /thinking of me.&quot;  Obviously, as James E. B. Breslin notes
perceptively, that person isn't the LeRoi with whom Frank is shaking
hands, but then Frank isn't thinking of LeRoi either.  &quot;Friendship,&quot;
for those who want &quot;boundless love,&quot; only goes so far,
especially when one has that terrifying sense of being only one
in eight million.
<P>
 To suggest that O'Hara's &quot;laundry list&quot;  is made meaningful
only by the oblique reference to the poet's putative lover in
the final lines is, I think, to posit closure where O'Hara explicitly
denies its possibility.  &quot;Personal Poem&quot; doesn't make
a point;  it presents <I>what it feels like</I>, at a fairly
bad time, to go to lunch with a friend (who is not a lover), and,
in the face of a persistent sense of anxiety, to draw on one's
basic reserve of humor and optimism.  It is the ubiquity of the
experience, not its oppressed-gay-man-in-1959 particularity, that
makes the poem so memorable.
<P>
 Similar questions are raised by Andrew Ross's provocative essay
on &quot;The Day Lady Died&quot;.   The essay argues, quite rightly
I think, that O'Hara's fabled &quot;culture of surface&quot; is
not without its own political resonances, its implicit critique
of a consumerism, dependent upon the sharply defined gender roles
of the fifties and the dilemma they posed for the gay man.  But
Ross's case seems curiously overdetermined:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> Looking back over O'Hara's poem we can see how it
tends to accept what might have been stereotypically regarded
as the social contours of gay masculinity in 1959, the obsession,
for example, with trivia, with feelings, with discriminations
of taste, and, of course, with the fine arts.  The tone of the
poem marks its obvious distance from the voice of legitimate masculinity;
O'Hara's is not the voice of the public sphere, where real decisions
are made by real men and where real politics is supposed to take
place.  In fact, the hectic itinerary followed by his poet could
just as well be that of a genteel lady about town, if you substitute
a hairdresser for the shoeshine, the Russian Tea Room for the
soda parlor, Rizzoli's for the Golden Griffin, and so on.. . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In fact, &quot;the 'day lady died' is an account
of a lady's day, played out by a man through an imagined lunch
hour that is the very opposite of the power lunches being eaten
in restaurants in the same few blocks by the men who make real
history (SE 388-89),</FONT>  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The difficulty with this argument is that Ross has to posit a
&quot;voice of legitimate masculinity&quot; against which O'Hara's
own homosexual one may be seen to position itself.  But whose
voice in 1959 (or, for that matter, at any other time) would this
be?  Did &quot;straight&quot; poets of the fifties--say, Robert
Lowell or Robert Creeley--present themselves as &quot;making real
history&quot; over their business &quot;power lunches&quot;? 
Or weren't they also outsiders by their very status as lyric poets?
 
<P>
  The relation to women is even trickier.  Ross's argument is
that &quot;the social contours of gay masculinity of 1959,&quot;
which O'Hara's poem supposedly embodies, allow the poet no choice
but to assume a feminine role: &quot;the hectic itinerary followed
by his poet could just as well be that of a genteel lady about
town.&quot;  O'Hara's elegy (see below pp. <I>179-82</I>
below) begins with the lines:
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>It is 12:20 in New York a Friday</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  three days after Bastille day, yes</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  and I don't know the people who will feed me  (<I>CP</I>
325)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&quot;Genteel&quot; lady shoppers are hardly likely to go out
to the Island on a summer Friday afternoon without knowing with
whom they are going to have dinner.  &quot;The people who will
feed me,&quot; moreover, is an odd way of referring to one's hosts:
who knows what unladylike things that &quot;feeding&quot; is to
include?  Again, the sense of immediacy and improvisation is underscored
by the reference to getting a shoeshine.  Ross's suggestion that
we need only substitute &quot;hairdresser&quot; for &quot;shoeshine&quot;
for the day to reveal itself as a &quot;lady's day,&quot; curiously
misses O'Hara's nuance.  Ladies' visits to the hairdresser are
scheduled and regular--part of the routine of putting oneself
together, rather like brushing one's teeth and putting on make-up
in the morning.  But one doesn't schedule a shoeshine or make
an appointment to have one:  one does it (or rather, a <I>man</I>
does it) on the spur of the moment so as to &quot;look good,&quot;
to make an immediate impression, especially when one doesn't know
&quot;the people who will feed me.&quot;  And the further irony
is that, what with the drinking and the partying that could be
anticipated at Mike and Patsy's, no one would notice Frank's shoeshine
anyway.  It is merely a way of (literally) putting one's best
foot forward. 
<P>
 Or consider the lines in the following stanza: &quot;I go on
to the bank / and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard)
/ doesn't even look up my balance for once in my life.&quot; 
This seemingly casual and irrelevant reference, far from linking
the poet to genteel lady shoppers with their &quot;busy social
schedules,&quot; has precisely the opposite effect.  What bank
teller would confront a Madison Avenue matron by looking up her
balance?  What matron would give so much as a thought to the teller's
name?  The implication of the lines is that the poet is always
self-conscious about being &quot;different&quot;:  polite and
friendly as he is at the bank, Miss Stillwagon evidently perceives
him as just a bit queer, and besides he is evidently prone to
overdrawing on his account.   The routine withdrawal of money
thus becomes an incident worth reporting.   The name &quot;Stillwagon,&quot;
moreover, with its oxymoronic conjunction of whiskey still and
being on the wagon, anticipates the crisis of Billie Holiday's
last days.
<P>
 It is charged language of this sort (a good bit of which I missed
the first time I discussed the poem) that makes O'Hara's work
so fascinating.  As for &quot;consumerism,&quot; it should be
noted that every item the poet buys (or contemplates buying) is
bought <I>for someone else</I>.  Intense friendship, which
is the gay poet's alternative to the family networks that determine
the largely routine purchases made by the typical New York lady
shopper, depends upon the careful discrimination and choice of
gifts:  Frank knows Patsy's taste for Verlaine and that Mike especially
likes to drink Strega.  And , in the larger sense, it is the set
of choices of the poem's maker that provides us with a catalogue
of items, all of which (as I suggest in Chapter 5), relate, like
Miss Stillwagon, to Billie Holiday herself.   In line 17, for
example, the poet contemplates buying &quot;Brendan Behan's new
play or <I>Le Balcon</I> or <I>Les N&egrave;gres</I>
/ of Genet.&quot;   Behan, who drank himself to death at a young
age, anticipates Lady Day's death from a drug overdose, while
the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of <I>Les N&egrave;gres</I> sets
the stage for Lady Day's climactic appearance at the Five Spot.
  As for Genet himself (and the characters in <I>Le Balcon</I>),
the motif introduced by the invocation of the gay, ex-convict
author is that of the artist punished for his  or her deviance--punished,
in Lady Day's case, by premature death. 
<P>
 To say that the poet's itinerary is conceived as the daily shopping
round of a genteel lady thus glosses over precisely those images
and phrases that make &quot;The Day Lady Died&quot; the bitter-sweet,
poignant elegy it is.  &quot;Totally abashed and smiling&quot;
(CP 406), fearful and funny, self-possessed and yet profoundly
vulnerable, the poet who makes his Manhattan rounds on a Friday
(with Bastille Day soon to come!),  is the Frank who was given
to referring to New York as &quot;Sodom-on-Hudson,&quot; the Frank
who had written in his Harvard Journal,  &quot;I often wish I
had the strength to commit suicide, but on the other hand, if
I had, I probably wouldn't feel the need.  God!  Can't you let
us win once in a while?&quot; (10/17/48, EW 100).   If the sensibility
here is indeed &quot;gay,&quot; we must remember that not all
gay sensibility of the period-- Allen Ginsberg is a case in point--
strikes the note of comic pathos, of humor laced with tough common
sense, and especially of complex verbal play, that is O'Hara's
legacy to poetry.<BR>

<P>
 It has taken a long time for such campy irreverence to be taken
seriously.  In a brilliant review essay for <I>Parnassus</I>
(1977), Thomas Meyer put it this way:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>However intricate the underpinning  gender arrangements,
we are still convinced the opposite of all that is authentic,
expressive, and profound remains the light, quick, casual though
deft gesture.  And when considering greatness the absolute enemy
is camp, best exemplified by the urban, loose, and high-living
male homosexual. . . . Then, too, the material O'Hara worked with
looks too often on first glance chi-chi, dizzy, piss elegant,
and faggoty.  Or else his poems seem adolescent, their exuberance
and excitement made embarrassing by what appears a lack of emotional
maturity. . . . The qualities of emotion he wrote about, and from,
are the hardest to admit:  breathlessness, excitement, anticipation
and expectation.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Breathlessness, excitement, anticipation:  in the first wave of
criticism of O'Hara's work, my own included, these qualities were
related to what was then called &quot;Action Painting,&quot; the
painting of Jackson Pollock and his fellow Abstract Expressionists
in which, as Harold Rosenberg put it, &quot;the canvas becomes
an arena upon which to <I>act</I> rather than a space in
which to reproduce&quot; (see below <I>p. 85</I>).   In
tracking the Pollock--Kline--de Kooning connection, critics were,
of course, drawing on O'Hara's own extensive commentary on these
painters and his exhibitions of their work.  Yet here is an instance
when considerations of gender are surely relevant.  
<P>
 In Chapter 3, I observed that O'Hara &quot;was really more at
home with painting that retains at least some figuration than
with pure abstraction&quot; (below, p. 85),  but what I failed
to see is that when one actually reads O'Hara's poems against,
say, Pollock's drip paintings or de Kooning's erotic images of
women, one becomes aware of more difference than similarity. 
 The discourse of male power and authority characteristic of Pollock
and de Kooning--a discourse comparable to that of Charles Olson,
whom O'Hara overtly criticized as too grandiose, too bent on making
&quot;the important utterance&quot; (see<B> </B>below, p. 15),
could hardly have been all that congenial to a poet whose signature
was &quot;the light, casual though deft gesture.&quot;   And further:
although I paid close attention to O'Hara's collaborations with
Larry Rivers, Grace Hartigan, and Norman Bluhm, I now feel I slighted
a relationship more significant than any of the above--namely
O'Hara's affinity to Jasper Johns.  
<P>
 O'Hara and Johns first met in 1957.  At least five of O'Hara's
poems refer to or are dedicated to &quot;Jap,&quot; including
the seminal &quot;Joe's Jacket.&quot; (see below, pp. 148-52).
  Johns for his part has made a number of works that refer to
O'Hara, of which the best known is probably <I>Skin with O'Hara
Poem</I> of 1963-65.   The relationship between the two artists
deserves a full study;  here I merely want to say a few words
about Johns's <I>In Memory of My Feelings</I>--<I>Frank
O'Hara</I> (1961),which provides an especially interesting
visual analogue to O'Hara's poem by that title, written in 1956,
as well as the many related poems that foreground ordinary objects.
<P>
   In the lower right-hand corner of Johns's painting (see above,
p. <I>ii</I>) next to the stencilled title &quot;In Memory of
My Feelings,&quot; and all but hidden behind the thick blue-gray
brushstrokes, we find the outline of a skull and the words &quot;DEAD
MAN.&quot;  The phrase may be glossed by a citation from one of
Johns's sketchbooks, as reproduced by John Cage in his essay-poem
&quot;Jasper Johns: Stories and Ideas.&quot;  The note reads:
 &quot;<I>A Dead Man</I>.  <I>Take a skull.  Cover it
with paint.  Rub it against canvas.  Skull against canvas</I>.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;With this DEAD MAN,&quot; writes Fred Orton, &quot;Johns
returns, albeit referentially, to figuration after years of painting
flags and targets, numbers and letters.&quot;   For at left center,
silhouetted against a network of blue and greyish abstract forms,
is an ordinary silver spoon, with a fork behind it, the two bound
together and suspended on a wire screwed to the top of the painting.
  These utensils, which reappear, together with a knife, in Johns's
illustrations for the MOMA commemorative volume <I>In Memory
of My Feelings</I>, appear frequently in his work.   Ordinary
domestic objects, they are curiously stripped of their normal
associations by their placement and context.   Spoons and forks
are to eat with, not to hang suspended from a wire. Spoons and
forks are to be held by a human being, using both hands, not bound
together as they are here.  The empty spoon behind which the fork
&quot;hides&quot; thus has no use value; its conventional shape,
moreover, seems to have no relationship to what Leo Steinberg
defines as Johns's &quot;M-W brushstroke that looks and functions
like the corrugated staples carpenters use,&quot; nor to the unpainted
lower edge of the canvas, and the familiar New York School drip
above it.   Rather, the spoon, with its shadow aureole, intersects
the black line that seems to separate the greyish rectangle above
it from the larger blue-white rectangle in which it is embedded.
 Is this inner rectangle a window?  A window-shade?  A mirror?
 Or just an area of the larger rectangle painted in different
colors?
<P>
 The notion of mirror image is further suggested by the hinges
that divide the painting in half.  But again, these hinges are
deceptive: the left half of the painting, far from mirroring the
right, does not quite correlate with it.  The abstract field (blue,
white, blue-gray, a tiny bit of red) on the right provides no
match for the image of the hanging spoon and fork or the light
gray rectancle on the left, nor to the blue drips on white background
beneath it.  <I>In Memory of My Feelings</I> thus produces
a curious disorientation for the viewer.  Halves don't match,
a spoon is not to eat with but hangs, so to speak, by a thread
like a corpse, and the &quot;skull&quot; associated with &quot;DEAD
MAN&quot; has been &quot;covered with paint&quot; and &quot;rubbed
against canvas&quot; according to Johns's prescription.  
<P>
  &quot;Metonymy,&quot;  Fred Orton observes in his discussion
of Johns's technique, &quot;is based on a proposed continuous
or sequential link between the literal object and its replacement
by association or reference.  It is the record of a lacuna, of
a move or displacement from cause to effect, container to contained,
thing seen to where it was seen, goal to auxiliary tool.  The
metonymic processes are reduction, expansion, and association.
. . . {Metonymy] represents not the object or thing or event or
feeling which is its referent but that which is tied to it by
contingent or associative transfers of meaning&quot; (FF 172).
  It is precisely such &quot;associative transfers&quot; that
characterize O'Hara's &quot;In Memory of my Feelings&quot;(see
below pp. 140-46).   &quot;My quietness has a man in it&quot;:
 the opening shift from container to contained sets the stage
for the insistent role reversals, the split-second displacements
of the poet's &quot;transparent selves&quot; --a mobility (&quot;to
love is to move&quot;) that is finally life-threatening:
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>                    and I have lost what is always
everywhere </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  present, the scene of my selves, the occasion of
these ruses,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  which I myself and singly must now kill</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>        and save the serpent in their</FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>midst.</FONT>
 <FONT SIZE=2>(CP 257</FONT>).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The &quot;occasion of these ruses&quot; is not unlike Johns's
staging of the empty spoon as the stick figure  of a man about
to be hung by the wire around his throat, even as the brushstrokes
that make up the painting's ground remain resistant to such translation.
 &quot;Metonymy,&quot; Orton remarks, &quot;permits the utterer
to bypass obstacles of social censure including those which are
consciously or unconsciously self-imposed&quot; (FF 172).   In
Johns's painting as in O'Hara's poem,  erotic energy becomes the
property of objects and utensils, of words and brushstrokes, so
that its autobiographical connections remain obscure. &quot;So
many of my transparencies,&quot; as O'Hara puts it, &quot;could
not resist the race!&quot; (CP 253).  
<P>
 I don't want to overplay the identity between poet and painter:
 Johns's work is much cooler than O'Hara's, less campy and droll,
more conceptual and austere.  But what has become apparent with
the passage of time is that O'Hara's aesthetic is closer to the
conceptualism of the John Cage--Merce Cunningham--Jasper Johns--Robert
Rauschenberg circle of the fifties and sixties (a circle of gay,
if notably closeted and discreet, artists) than to the openly
emotive and expressive gestures of Action Painting or Black Mountain
or Beat aesthetic.  &quot;The secret,&quot; as Clark Coolidge
put it in his contribution to <I>Homage to Frank O'Hara</I>,
&quot;is that flamboyance <I>can</I> be so exact. (discrete?)
 And the word &quot;discreet&quot; can be used for something more
precise than prudence if you move one of those e's to that end.&quot;
 &quot;It's after all,&quot; Coolidge notes, &quot;a matter of
movement and the standing objects.  The dream of starting to speak
and the words all coming to you for once in the right order, surprises
. . . . &quot;An inclusion of vectors inexplicable to syntax&quot;
(BB 183-84).  <BR>

<P>
 &quot;An inclusion of vectors inexplicable to syntax&quot;: 
Coolidge's notes on O'Hara, published in 1978 within a year of
my own book, signaled a shift in the understanding of the poet's
work, perhaps even more important than the shift in gay politics
I discussed above.  For in 1978 a new mimeograph magazine called
<I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</I>, edited by Bruce Andrews and Charles
Bernstein,  made its first appearance, and some important reconfig-urations
of the literary map began to take place.
<P>
 In his own lifetime and for more than decade subsequently, O'Hara
was known as a &quot;New York Poet,&quot; and his progeny have
been taken to be the poets who deliberately adapted his forms
and styles: Ron Padgett, Ted Berrigan, Jim Brodey, Michael Brownstein,
, John Perreault, Alice Notley, Eileen Myles, and a host of other
younger poets loosely associated with St. Mark's Poetry Center
in the Bowery.   Clark Coolidge's own poetry, for that matter,
was first disseminated in Ron Padgett and David Shapiro's <I>Anthology
of New York Poets</I> (1970).  Yet even in this early appearance,
Coolidge was writing a very different sort of poetry from, say,
the Jim Brodey, whose &quot;Poem ('Woke This A.M.')&quot; begins
with the lines &quot;Woke this A. M. / radio signals in the sunshine
at my sleepy door.&quot;  Consider the following six-line poem
(NYP 38):
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>prune acrylic whose</FONT>

<P>
Here word play, asyntacticality, radical ellipsis, and visual
configuration point toward the work (Coolidge's own included)
soon to be published by such West Coast journals as <I>This</I>
(1971) and <I>Hills</I> (1973), and, more prominently,
in <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.</I>  It seems a far cry from O'Hara's
&quot;Personism,&quot; with its jaunty assurance that &quot;you
just go on your nerve.&quot;  But perhaps it took a New York Poet
<I>manqu&eacute;</I> like Coolidge to understand that O'Hara's
&quot;discreet&quot; / &quot;discrete&quot; language (as opposed
to the O'Hara mystique), far from sanctifying the &quot;natural,&quot;
the casual, and the unique speaking voice, was actually providing
a groundwork for the newmaterialist poetics.
<P>
 &quot;Note,&quot; cautions Charles Bernstein in &quot;Stray Straws
and Straw Men,&quot; &quot;that O'Hara's word 'personism' is not
'personalism': it acknowledges the work to be a fronting of another
<I>person</I>--another mind, if you will, as much as another
nature.  O'Hara's work <I>proposes</I> a domain of the
personal, and not simply <I>assuming</I> it, fully works
it out.  His  remarkable use of voice, for example, allows, through
a musing whimsy in that voice, for fantasy as wild as any surrealist
imagines, contained, still, within his proposed boundaries.&quot;
  Another way of saying this is that for O'Hara, &quot;voice,&quot;
far from being a given, is, as Bernstein says, with comic bombast
(referring to poetry in general):  &quot;constructed, rule governed,
everywhere circumscribed by grammar &amp; syntax . . . designed,
manipulated, picked, programmed, organized, and so an artifice,
artifact--monadic, solipsistic, homemade, manufactured, mechanized,
formulaic, willful&quot; (CD 40-41).  Bob Perelman, in his witty
spoof of O'Hara's &quot;A True Account of Talking to the Sun at
Fire Island,&quot; points at the same construction of &quot;voice,&quot;
when he has Roland Barthes interrupt O'Hara's recitation of &quot;A
Step away From Them,&quot; with the comment:
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Langurously agitating: Frank, I detect a
poetic phrase--even an elaborately  sounded structure.&quot;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
And Perelman's own &quot;Alphabet of Literary History&quot;  is
testimony to the influence O'Hara's &quot;elaborately sounded
structures,&quot; with their daring mix of &quot;high&quot; and
&quot;low&quot; and their predilection for pun and allusion, have
had on the next generation.  Here is a snatch from the &quot;B&quot;

<P>
The O'Hara who wrote &quot;The Critic&quot; (see pp. <I>x,xxxi-xxxiii</I>)
would have enjoyed this parodic &quot;Alphabet,&quot; although,
it must be said, his own work always contained more pain.   Take
the first four lines of &quot;Ode (To Joseph LeSueur) On The Arrow
That Flieth by Day&quot; (CP 300, see below pp. 117-20):
<P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>To humble yourself before a radio on Sunday</FONT>

              or something hyphenated     (CP 300)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 It seems nothing if not natural and direct: Frank, hung-over
and grouchy, sounding off to his roommate Joe, the poem hence
&quot;between two persons instead of two pages&quot; (CP 499),.
 But beneath the bravado of &quot;Personism&quot; is, as Perelman's
Barthes points out, an &quot;elaborately sounded structure.&quot;
 First, the complexities of genre:  the ode evidently alludes
to Wallace Stevens's &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; in which the
woman's &quot;Complacencies of the peignoir, and late / Coffee
and oranges in a sunny chair&quot; replace the expected Sunday
church-going ritual.  The poet's own Sunday morning ritual is
to &quot;humble [himself] before a radio&quot; rather than before
the &quot;altar&quot; of his Catholic boyhood.  Casual as the
reference seems, it thus immediately sounds the note of an alienated
Sunday.  What we don't yet know is that it also happens to be
Mother's Day--a double whammy for this particular prodigal son.
 The sense of pain soon to be introduced--&quot;do we really need
anything more to be sorry about / wouldn't it be extra, as all
pain is extra&quot;-- is foreshadowed by the sardonic modulation
of &quot;it's amusing&quot; into &quot;like dying after a party.&quot;
  Indeed, the memory of last night is reduced to a &quot;'click'&quot;
(with its ambiguous reference to camera--the &quot;party shot&quot;--and
gun) and, absurdly, &quot;you're dead from fall-out, hang-over,
/ or something hyphenated.&quot;   Here the poem condenses into
eight words the relationship of Frank's own situation (&quot;hang-over&quot;)
to the public sphere (the fear of atomic fall-out), as well as
the anxiety of dealing with the unknown, unnamable.  &quot;Something
hyphenated&quot;:  it must be one of those diseases you read about
in the papers but whose name you can't pronounce.  
<P>
 To read these lines is to see how thoroughly, if obliquely, the
naturalistic&quot; ode has internalized the political and sexual
discourses of its day.   At the time of writing (the poem is dated
11 May 1958), the Soviet Union had just completed the first operative
ICBM (see the allusion in line 20), thus prompting the belligerent
U.S. reaction to a supposed &quot;missile gap.&quot;   From Frank's
point of view, the missile hysteria marks a kind of moral &quot;death
of a nation&quot; (see the film allusion in line 25), a nation
which is &quot;henceforth to be called small.&quot;  In this newly
&quot;small&quot; nation, the advent of AIDS was still decades
away and yet the talk of death from &quot;something hyphenated&quot;
now seems like a curious anticipation of HIV.   And yet, the use
of the second-person implies, &quot;you&quot; musn't take it all
too seriously:  &quot;it's amusing&quot;--&quot;'click'&quot;--
just as it's amusing to make up absurd Mother's Day messages and
send them to a &quot;Russia&quot; that no longer exists.   Amusing,
&quot;except I will never feel CONTEST:  WIN A Dream Trip pertains
to / me, somehow.&quot;  Even here, though, the defense mechanism
kicks in: &quot;(Joe, I wouldn't go, probably).&quot;  
<P>
 O'Hara's language in these mock-odes and elegies (rather than
the O'Hara mystique)  has provided an important bridge to the
language poetics of the 1980s and 90s.   Indeed,  just as it is
no longer enough to read O'Hara's poetry as the verbal counterpart
of New York abstract expressionist painting, so it no longer seems
satisfactory to view him  primarily as a founding father of New
York Poetry,  a school allied, in Donald Allen's <I>New American
Poetry</I> (1960), primarily with Black Mountain, the Beats,
and the so-called San Francisco Renaissance.  Rather, we can now
see that this &quot;master of peripheral vision,&quot; as Coolidge
refers to O'Hara (BB 184), devised linguistic structures that
anticipate the poetics of our own moment, from Charles Bernstein,
Ron Silliman and Kathleen Fraser down to Peter Gizzi and Kenneth
Goldsmith, Cole Swensen and Susan Wheeler.
<P>
 It has taken a long time to understand that those &quot;streamers
of crepe paper fluttering before the electric fan,&quot; as Bewley
called them, are actually the most intricate of language games.
 One artist who did see it, early on, was John Cage, who wrote
the following memorial &quot;mesostic&quot; (internal acrostic)
on the poet's name:

Here it is Hart Crane's tongue that provides, via John Cage's
tribute, that small  apostrophe (not even a full-fledged letter!)
for the name &quot;O'Hara,&quot; and &quot;frAncisco&quot; (Frank)
is linked to &quot;kino&quot;--the film art that was his special
love.  The flow of poetry, Cage suggests, depends upon such expanding
tributaries.
