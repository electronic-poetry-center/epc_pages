  <P>In <I>The New York Times Book Review</I>, 24 June 1990, Arthur C. Danto
  pronounced <I>Gone Primitive</I> &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;provocative,&quot;
  &quot;a superb book.&quot; In <I>Modern </I>Philology , 89 (February 1992),
  Sander Gilman similarly declares, &quot;Marianna Torgovnick has now provided
  us all (academic and nonacademic specialists) with a brilliant, exciting,
  and innovative reading of our 'modern' ... fascination with the image of
  the primitive&quot; (437). And he concludes by remarking, &quot;I put down
  this book feeling that cultural studies in this country had come a lot
  further than I had imagined&quot; (439). And in &quot;Otherness is in the
  Details,&quot; <I>The Nation</I>, 5 November 1990, pp. 530-36, Micaela
  di Leonardo, who does comment on some of the book's &quot;key lacunas,&quot;
  calls Torgovnick's goal &quot;laudable,&quot; her critique of humanism
  &quot;valuable,&quot; and &quot;her interpretations of the shifting meanings
  and wildly enhanced monetary value of primitive art ... particularly acute&quot;

  <P><A NAME="4"></A><B>4.</B> See, for example, GP 17-18. Torgovnick also cites
  Edward Said and Christopher Miller as ignoring the gender issue. In keeping
  with her own assessment, Torgovnick's book has been marketed as a &quot;corrective&quot;
  to Clifford's. In her book blurb, for example, Catharine R. Stimpson calls
  <I>Gone Primitive</I> &quot;an extraordinary account of the ways in which
  race, gender, and a terrible romance with 'the primitive' have structured
  Western culture.&quot; </P>

  Lewitt, Mich&egrave;le Richman, and J. B. Pontalis, as well as extracts

  for which I owe the relevant information to Philippe Lejeune's important
  <I>Lire Leiris</I> (Paris: Editions Klincksieck, 1975), pp. 109-110. Lejeune
  points out that the Livre de Poche blow up projects the idea of violence
  exercised on oneself (Lucrece) onto the figure of Judith, whereas the Folio
  cardgame image, &quot;no produit pas pour autant l'effet &eacute;rotique

  d'homme</I> : Politics and the Sacred in Everyday Ethnography,&quot; YFS:
  91-110. Richman writes, &quot;In [Leiris's] favorite mythological pantheon,
  Judith and Lucretia transform their horrific situations into parables of
  strength, offering dramas in which the victim/ executioner relationship
  is played out with unexpected heroism&quot; (95). But &quot;the particular
  mixture of sacred terror and pity [Judith and Lucretia] evoke is tinged
  with a sense of remorse due to [the narrator'] own cowardice as well as
  cruelty, which in turn promote the 'crainte superstitieuse d'un ch&acirc;timent'&quot;

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>However little taste one might have for proposing metaphors as explanations,
    civilization may be compared without too much inexactness to the thin greenish
    layer-- the living magma and the odd detritus-- that forms on the surface
    of calm water and sometimes solidifies into a crust, until an eddy comes
    to break it up. All our moral practices and our polite customs, that radiantly
    colored cloak that hides the coarseness of our dangerous instincts, all
    those lovely forms of culture we are so proud of--since it is thanks to
    them that we can call ourselves &quot;civilized&quot;-- are ready to dissappear
    at the slightest turbulence, to shatter at the slightest impact (like the
    thin mirror on a fingernail whose polish cracks or roughens) allowing our
    horrifying <I>primitiveness</I> to appear in the interstices, revealed
    by the fissures just as hell might be revealed by earthquakes. (p. 19)</P>
