In the autumn of 1939, Ludwig Wittgenstein and his young Cambridge student
and friend Norman Malcolm were walking along the river when they saw a newspaper
vendor's sign announcing that the Germans had accused the British government
of instigating a recent attempt to assassinate Hitler. When Wittgenstein
remarked that it wouldn't surprise him at all if it were true, Malcolm retorted
that it was impossible because &quot;the British were too civilized and
decent to attempt anything so underhand, and . . . such an act was incompatible
with the British 'national character'.&quot; Wittgenstein was furious. Some
five years later, he wrote to Malcolm: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whenever I thought of you I couldn't help thinking of a particular
incident which seemed to me very important. . . . you made a remark about
'national character' that shocked me by its primitiveness. I then thought:
what is the use of studying philosophy if all that it does for you is to
enable you to talk with some plausibility about some abstruse questions
of logic, etc., &amp; if it does not improve your thinking about the important
questions of everyday life, if it does not make you more conscientious than
any . . . journalist in the use of the DANGEROUS phrases such people use
for their own ends. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#2" TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
What <I>is</I> the use of studying philosophy if it doesn't improve your
thinking about the important questions of everyday life? It is the pressing
question Wittgenstein asked himself throughout his career as a philosopher.
As early as 1913 in the <I>Notes on Logic,</I> he wrote, &quot;In philosophy
there are no deductions: <I>it</I> is purely descriptive. Philosophy gives
no pictures of reality.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#3" TARGET="resource window">3</A>)</FONT>
And a few years later, he made the following riddling entry in the manuscript
that was to become the <I>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</I>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>We feel that even if <I>all possible </I>scientific questions
be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all. But
of course there is then no question left, and just this is the answer. (T
#6.52)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, when Wittgenstein chides Malcolm for accepting as &quot;true&quot;
the proposition that assassination attempts are alien to the British &quot;national
character,&quot; the issue is not whether the British government did or
did not participate in a plot to assassinate Hitler, but whether it is meaningful
to assert that it was too &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;decent&quot; to
do so. Ethical propositions, propositions about such things as &quot;national
character,&quot; Wittgenstein held, are always questionable: &quot;nothing
we could ever think or say should be <I>the</I> thing.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#4" TARGET="resource window">4</A>)</FONT>
Imagine, then, what Wittgenstein would have made of our current propensity
for sloganizing, the predilection, not just on the part of TV journalists,
but in intellectual life, for pious phrase-making about &quot;the end of
history,&quot; &quot;the age of Reagan,&quot; &quot;the cold war mentality,&quot;
&quot;the Me decade,&quot; &quot;the Vietnam syndrome,&quot; and so on.<BR>
<BR>
One such set of &quot;primitive&quot; propositions has to do with poetry.
A recent book by Vernon Shetley bears the ominous title <I>After the Death
of Poetry</I>; another recent book, this one by Dana Gioia, is called <I>Can
Poetry Matter?</I>, the author noting sadly that &quot;American poetry now
belongs to a subculture,&quot; that &quot;Daily newspapers no longer review
poetry,&quot; and that &quot;although there is a great deal of poetry around,
none of it matters very much to readers, publishers, or advertisers--to
anyone, that is, except other poets.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#5" TARGET="resource window">5</A>)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Are such &quot;DANGEROUS phrases&quot; to be taken at face value? Wittgenstein
might have responded by asking Shetley or Gioia what the &quot;it&quot;
is that no longer &quot;matters, the &quot;it&quot; that is by the critics'
testimony so sadly &quot;diminished,&quot; so marginalized, so evidently
beside the point in the culture of late twentieth-century America. And he
would have been equally suspicious of the critics' prescriptions for change
(e.g., Gioia's argument that if we could only get rid of Creative Writing
programs, poetry might once again belong to the &quot;public&quot;), asking
to <I>whom</I> poetry <I>should</I> matter and why? It all depends, after
all, on what questions one chooses to ask in a given instance. As Wittgenstein
put it in a notebook entry of 1942, &quot;A man will be <I>imprisoned</I>
in a room with a door that's unlocked and opens inwards; as long as it does
not occur to him to <I>pull</I> rather than to push it&quot; (CV 42). Or
again: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Earlier physicists are said to have found suddenly that they
had too little mathematical understanding to cope with physics; and in almost
the same way young people today can be said to be in a situation where ordinary
common sense no longer suffices to meet the strange demands life makes.
Everything has become so intricate that mastering it would require an exceptional
intellect. Because skill at playing the game is no longer enough; the question
that keeps coming up is: can this game be played at all now and what would
be the right game to play? (CV 27)</BLOCKQUOTE>
What, we might ask, extrapolating from Wittgenstein's question, is the &quot;right&quot;
poetry game to be played today and, if &quot;skill&quot;--let us say, the
ability to use meter, rhyme, and &quot;vivid&quot; imagery-- is no longer
enough, how should it be reformulated? To put it more concretely: what role
does the interrogation of language which <I>dichten</I> (composing poetry)
entails play in the mass culture of the later twentieth century? Theodor
Adorno, after all, had famously declared in 1967 that &quot;Cultural criticism
finds itself faced with the final stage of the dialectic of culture and
barbarism. To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. And this corrodes
even the knowledge of why it has become impossible to write poetry today.&quot;
<FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#6" TARGET="resource window">6</A>)</FONT> What,
then, replaces the &quot;poetic&quot; in cultural consciousness?<BR>
<BR>
Wittgenstein would have had no answers to these and related questions. On
the contrary, his writing of &quot;philosophy&quot; <I>as if</I> it were
&quot;poetry&quot; dramatizes the process of working through particular
questions so as to test what can and cannot be said about literary forms
(e.g., poetry), concepts (e.g., barbarism), and facts of life (e.g., death).
&quot;A philosopher,&quot; he wrote in 1944, &quot;is a man who has to cure
many intellectual diseases in himself before he can arrive at the notions
of common sense&quot; (CV 44). And again, &quot;My account will be hard
to follow: because it says something new but still has egg-shells from the
old view sticking to it&quot; (CV 44). Perhaps it is this curious mix of
mysticism and common-sense, of radical thought to which the &quot;egg-shells&quot;
of one's old views continue to &quot;stick,&quot; that has made Wittgenstein,
who had no interest at all in the &quot;poetry&quot; of his own time, paradoxically
a kind of patron saint for poets and artists. <BR>
<BR>
In the Introduction to the screenplay he wrote for Derek Jarman's 1993 film
on Wittgenstein, Terry Eagleton remarks: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The library of artistic works on Ludwig Wittgenstein continues
to accumulate. What is it about this man, whose philosophy can be taxing
and technical enough, which so fascinates the <I>artistic </I>imagination?
Frege is a philosopher's philosopher, Bertrand Russell every shopkeeper's
image of the sage, and Sartre the media's idea of an intellectual; but Wittgenstein
is the philosopher of poets and composers, playwrights and novelists, and
snatches of his mighty <I>Tractatus </I>have even been set to music. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#7" TARGET="resource window">7</A>)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Eagleton himself had fallen under Wittgenstein's spell some years earlier
when he wrote a witty novel called <I>Saints and Scholars</I> (1987), in
which Wittgenstein, fleeing the insularity and hypocrisy of Cambridge, rents
a cottage on the Irish coast with his friend, the Russian emigre linguistic
philosopher Nikolai Bakhtin (the great critic Mikhail's brother), who, unlike
the austere Wittgenstein, happens to be a great gourmet. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#8" TARGET="resource window">8</A>)</FONT>
No sooner have the two dons settled in, then they are forced to grant asylum
to the Irish patriot James Connolly, on the run from the British government
and to Leopold Bloom, on the run from anti-Semitism in Joyce's Dublin. The
conversation between these principals on the value of revolution and related
topics is the substance of the novel, Wittgenstein taking the hard line.
&quot;Revolution,&quot; he tells Connolly, &quot;is the dream of the metaphysician,&quot;
and again, &quot;the idea of a total break in human life is an illusion.
There's nothing <I>total</I> to be broken. As though all we know now could
stop, and something entirely different start.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#9" TARGET="resource window">9</A>)</FONT>
And yet, the novel suggests, it is Wittgenstein who emerges as perhaps the
true radical of the group in his clear-eyed assessment of what the situation
really warrants. <BR>
<BR>
A similar, if more stylized, fantasy is found in Guy Davenport's short story
&quot;The Aeroplanes at Brescia,&quot; published in the collection <I>Tatlin!
</I>in 1974. Davenport imagines that in 1909, when Kafka and his friends
Max and Otto Brod are (as in fact they were) vacationing at Como, they decide
to attend the great air show at Brescia, where the aviators Louis Bl&eacute;riot,
Glenn Curtiss, and the brothers Wright are scheduled to perform. As they
watch Bl&eacute;riot preparing his plane (&quot;a yellow dragonfly of waxed
wood, stretched canvas, and wires&quot;), they become aware of a stranger:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Near them a tall man with thick chestnut hair held his left
wrist as if it might be in pain. It was the intensity of his eyes that caught
Kafka's attention more than his tall leanness which, from the evidence about,
marked the aeronaut and the mechanic. This was the age of the bird man and
of the magician of the machine. Who knows but that one of these preoccupied
faces might belong to Marinetti himself? This was a crane of a man. The
very wildness of his curly brown hair and the tension in his long fingers
seemed to speak of man's strange necessity to fly. He was talking to a short
man in a mechanic's blue smock and with an eye-patch. From his mouth flew
the words <I>Kite Flying Upper </I>Air Station, H&ouml;here Luftstazion
zum Drachensteigenlassen. Then the small man raised his square hands and
cocked his head in a question. <I>Glossop,</I> was the answer, followed
by the green word <I>Derbyshire</I>. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#10" TARGET="resource window">10</A>)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
From 1908 to 1911, the real Wittgenstein studied aeronautics at the University
of Manchester; his main research project on the design and construction
of kites was carried on at the Kite Flying Upper Atmosphere Station near
Glossop. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#11" TARGET="resource window">11</A>)</FONT>
Davenport, evidently fascinated by the very unusual but apposite practical
training the future philosopher received (Wittgenstein did not have a university
education), posits what might have happened if Wittgenstein and Kafka, two
of the great avant-gardists to come out of the assimilated Jewish world
of the Austro-Hungarian empire, two writers who, however, were never to
know each other's work, had met (or rather, almost met) at the Brescia air
show. &quot;Who,&quot; Davenport has Franz [Kafka] ask the Italian reporter,
[&quot;is] that tall man with the deep eyes and chestnut hair?&quot; (GDAB
65). The <I>giornalista </I>doesn't know, but later, after Bl&eacute;riot's
flight, he hands Franz a piece of paper: &quot;Kafka looked at the name.
It read, in light pencil, the kind meticulous men used to jot down fractions
and the abbreviated titles of learned journals, volume, number, and page,
probably a thin silver pencil with fine lead, <I>Ludwig Wittgenstein</I>
&quot; (GDAP 67). <BR>
<BR>
That's all that happens. The two men never meet. But after Curtiss's dare-devil
flight, which wins him the grand prize, &quot;The man named Wittgenstein
was again holding his left wrist, massaging it as if it were in pain,&quot;
even as, on the other side of the field, Max asks Franz, &quot;why are there
tears in your eyes?&quot; and Franz responds, &quot;I don't know . . . I
don't know&quot; (GDAP 70).<BR>
<BR>
Davenport's is a parable about the avant-garde art of Mitteleuropa in the
pre-World War I years, an art in love with the technology that was soon
to destroy it. The air show, for that matter, takes place on what was soon
to be Fascist ground and hence off limits for both Wittgenstein and Kafka.
No doubt, it is ironies like these that have made the figure of Wittgenstein
so appealing to writers like Davenport and Eagleton, and theirs are only
two examples of the growing body of Wittgensteiniana that includes such
diverse novels and plays as Peter Handke's <I>Kaspar</I> (1968), Ingeborg
Bachmann's <I>Malina</I> (1971), Thomas Bernhard's <I>Wittgenstein's Nephew</I>
(1982), and <I>Ritter, Dene, Voss</I> (1984), Bruce Duffy's mock biography
<I>The World as I Found It</I> (1987), and David Markson's <I>Wittgenstein's
Mistress</I> (1988). Among poets, Wittgenstein's presence is even more startling.
In the last decade or so, the following poetry books (all published in the
U.S. or Canada) may be said to have been written under the sign of Wittgenstein:
Charles Bernstein's <I>The Sophist</I> and <I>Dark City</I>, Allen Davies's
<I>Signage</I>, Steve McCaffery's <I>Evoba: The Investigation Meditations
1976-78,</I> Tom Mandel's <I>Realism</I>, Michael Palmer's <I>Notes for
Echo Lake</I>, Joan Retallack's <I>Circumstantial Evidence</I>, Ron Silliman's
<I>The Age of Huts</I>, Rosmarie Waldrop's <I>Reproduction of Profiles</I>
and <I>A Key into the Language of America</I>, and Jan Zwicky's <I>Wittgenstein's
Elegies.</I> The list grows even longer when we include performance pieces:
for example, Laurie Anderson's &quot;Language is a Virus from Outer Space,&quot;
David Antin's &quot;The Poetry of Ideas and the Idea of Poetry,&quot; John
Cage's <I>I-VI</I> (The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures), and Johanna Drucker's
installation piece <I>The Wittgenstein Variations</I>. <I>Fluxus</I>, for
that matter, now recognized as one of the most important international art
movements of the later 1960s and 70s, is inconceivable without the example
of Wittgenstein, as are the recent poetic experiments of Emmanuel Hocquard
and Claude Royet-Journoud in France and the <I>Gruppo 93</I> in Italy. In
1992 Joseph Kosuth, whose series of &quot;Art Investigations&quot; are directly
modelled on Wittgenstein's writings, published a remarkable artist's book
called <I>Letters from Wittgenstein, Abridged in Ghent</I>. Like Cage or
the Tom Phillips of <I>A Humument</I>, Kosuth has produced a &quot;writing
through,&quot; in this case of the well-known bilingual edition of Wittgenstein's
letters to Karl Engelmann, a &quot;writing through&quot; composed of enigmatic
black-and-white photographs of Ghent cityscapes. How, Kosuth challenges
the viewer to determine, do these dreary images of factories, canals, parking
lots, and nondescript office buildings, relate to the passionate dialogue
about the meaning of life contained in the corresponence between Wittgenstein
and Engelmann?<BR>
<BR>
Like Wallace Stevens's blackbird, Wittgenstein's shadow thus marks &quot;the
edge / of one of many circles. &quot; But why? Is it primarily the life
that has fascinated literary artists? Yes and no, for Wittgenstein's life
is curiously bound up with his work. &quot;He was,&quot; writes Eagleton,
&quot;an arresting combination of monk, mystic and mechanic: a high European
intellectual who yearned for Tolstoyan <I>simplicitas,</I> a philosphical
giant with scant respect for philosophy, an irascible autocrat with a thirst
for holiness&quot; (WTE 7-8). The Wittgenstein paradoxes are indeed the
stuff of legend. A fabulously rich man who gave away all his money so he
wouldn't have to bother with it; a man, three of whose brothers committed
suicide and who frequently contemplated suicide himself and yet told friends,
on his deathbed, that he had had a wonderful life; a Jew baptised in the
Catholic church, with strong leanings toward Protestant piety; a Viennese
exile who made his home in Cambridge, England but insisted that he was &quot;German
through and through&quot;; a misogynist, who counted among his most brilliant
and devoted students Elizabeth Anscombe and Alice Ambrose; a closeted homosexual
who lived an outwardly austere life but was intimate with a series of much
younger men; a gentle man who abhorred violence but became a decorated hero
in World War I; an intellectual genius who, in his thirties, worked first
as a gardener and then as an elementary school teacher in rural Austria,
an apolitical man who went to the Soviet Union in his forties in the hopes
of becoming an ordinary worker and declared &quot;I am a communist, at heart&quot;;
a man who had no interest in modernist art movements and lived in Spartan
rented rooms furnished with assorted deck chairs, but who designed for his
sister Margarete Stonborough a starkly beautiful ultra-modernist house and
attended to every detail of its construction from radiators to door-knobs
<FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#12" TARGET="resource window">12</A>)</FONT> --
it is, no doubt, a life that lends itself to dramatic and fictional representation,
to the making of myths. For Wittgenstein comes to us as the ultimate modernist
outsider, the changeling who never stops re-inventing himself, never really
&quot;belongs,&quot; and whose presence is nevertheless so overwhelming
that we can immediately identify it as Wittgenstein's. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is this very contradictoriness, this refusal to stay in one place,
that has made Wittgenstein so appealing. &quot;He who understands me,&quot;
says Wittgenstein on the final page of the <I>Tractatus</I>, &quot;finally
recognizes [my propositions] as senseless, when he has climbed out through
them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after
he has climbed up on it) . . . . then he sees the world rightly&quot; (T
#6.54). But no sooner is the world seen &quot;rightly&quot; than new obstacles
appear which require new ladders. &quot;Forcing my thoughts into an ordered
sequence,&quot; said Wittgenstein, &quot;is a torment for me. Is it even
worth attempting now?&quot; (CV 28).<BR>
<BR>
The example Wittgenstein thus set writers from Samuel Beckett (who insisted
that he hadn't read any Wittgenstein until the late fifties, long after
he had completed such &quot;Wittgensteinian&quot; works as <I>Watt </I>and
<I>Waiting for Godot</I>), <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#13" TARGET="resource window">13</A>)</FONT>
to Bachmann and Bernstein, is that he never gave up the struggle, both with
himself and with language, never allowed himself to accept this or that
truth statement or totalizing system as <I>the</I> answer. &quot;Language,&quot;
he wrote in his notebook, &quot;sets everyone the same traps . . . . What
I have to do then is erect signposts at all the junctions where there are
wrong turnings so as to help people past the danger points&quot; (CV 18).
And one of the implications of the famous aphorism &quot;<I>The limits of
my </I>language mean the limits of my world&quot; (T #5.6), is that the
cult of personality, of a subject somehow <I>outside</I> language, that
dominated American poetry, from the confessionalism of the fifties to the
&quot;scenic mode&quot; (Charles Altieri's apt phrase) of the seventies
has now begun to give way to a resurgence of what was known, in the heyday
of the New Criticism which regarded it with some asperity, as &quot;the
poetry of ideas.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#14" TARGET="resource window">14</A>)</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
But not the &quot;poetry of ideas&quot; in the traditional sense, where
it meant the expression of significant &quot;content&quot; in appropriate
language and verse form. For if we accept Wittgenstein's premise that &quot;The
results of philosophy [and hence by analogy of poetry] are the uncovering
of one or another piece of plain nonsense and of bumps that the understanding
has got by running its head up against the limits of language,&quot; and
that &quot;These bumps make us see the value of the discovery&quot; (PI
#119), the &quot;poetry of ideas&quot; becomes the site of discovery, where
the &quot;bumps&quot; we receive by running our heads up against the walls
and ceilings of the rooms we dwell in are interrogated. And that process
of interrogation is of necessity tentative, self-cancelling, and self-correcting,
even as it deals with the most ordinary aspects of everyday life. Take the
following two examples: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why can't a dog simulate pain? Is he too honest? Could one teach
a dog to simulate pain? Perhaps it is possible to teach him to howl on particular
occasions as if he were in pain, even when he is not. But the surroundings
which are necessary for this behaviour to be real simulation are missing.
(PI #250). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can't hear God speak to someone else, you can hear him only if
you are being addressed&quot;. -- That is a grammatical remark. (Z #717)</BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Wittgenstein,&quot; says Guy Davenport in a discussion of these fragments,
&quot;did not argue; he merely thought himself into subtler and deeper problems.&quot;
<FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#15" TARGET="resource window">15</A>)</FONT> As
such, his Heraclitean epigrams easily shade into poetry. But the paradox--a
paradox of a piece with the ones I cited above-- is that this poet formulated
no poetics, had no &quot;theory&quot; of literature or art, and repeatedly
insisted that it was impossible to define the &quot;beautiful&quot; or to
say what the &quot;essence&quot; of art&quot; might be. Such professed skepticism,
coupled with what seemed to be simple ignorance about literature, was greeted
with suspicion, first by his Viennese and then by his English contemporaries.
&quot;Cultivated as he was,&quot; declared his Cambridge colleague F. R.
Leavis, &quot;[Wittgenstein's] interest in literature had remained rudimentary.&quot;
Indeed, aside from his knowledge of Dickens's <I>The Uncommercial Traveller</I>
and <I>A Christmas Carol,</I>&quot; Leavis reports, &quot;I never discovered
that he took any other creative writing seriously. It may of course be that
in German the range and quality of his literary culture were more impressive,
but I can't give any great weight to that possibility.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#16" TARGET="resource window">16</A>)</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
In one sense, Leavis was surely right. Cyril Barrett and others have tried
to defend Wittgenstein against such charges by noting that he certainly
knew his German classics, that, for example, when he was stationed on the
Eastern front, he asked his friend Karl Engelmann to send him the novellas
of Gottfried Keller, the historical dramas of Franz Grillparzer, and the
lyric poems of Uhland and M&ouml;rike. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#17" TARGET="resource window">17</A>)</FONT>
But it is not a question of listing the literary works Wittgenstein had
or had not read-- he insisted, for that matter, that he had never read Aristotle
or, closer to home, Hegel either-- but of outlook and sensibility. Just
as Wittgenstein, who had received extensive training in music, would not
listen to any composer later than Brahms, so he was indifferent to, if not
openly hostile toward, his poetic contemporaries. True, in an impulsive
act of legendary generosity, he bequeathed, in 1914, one hundred thousand
crowns (roughly the equivalent of one hundred thousand dollars today) to
Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of the literary magazine <I>Der Brenner,</I>
instructing Ficker to distribute the money &quot;among Austrian artists
who are without means.&quot; But of the three main beneficiaries--Rilke,
Trakl, and Carl Dallago--Rilke was the only poet with whose work Wittgenstein
was at all familiar. Of Trakl's poems, he wrote Ficker, &quot;I do not understand
them, but their <I>tone</I> makes me happy. It is the tone of genius.&quot;
Some months later, however, when Ficker sent him a posthumously published
edition of Trakl's works, Wittgenstein's only comment was that they were
&quot;probably very good&quot; but that, just now, he had &quot;no desire
to assimilate foreign thoughts&quot; (RM 118-20, 126). <BR>
<BR>
During his Cambridge years, Wittgenstein became even less responsive to
the artistic production of his contemporaries. In conversations with friends,
he was given to pessimistic representations of modernism. &quot;I was walking
about in Cambridge,&quot; he remarked in 1930, &quot;and passed a bookshop,
and in the window were portraits of Russell, Freud, and Einstein. A little
further on, in a music shop, I saw portraits of Beethoven, Schubert and
Chopin. Comparing these portraits I felt intensely the terrible degeneration
that had come over the human spirit in the course of only a hundred years&quot;
(RR 112). If this almost comically exaggerated Spenglerianism (how can one
compare Einstein to Chopin?) sounds a bit like the epitaphs for poetry made
by critics today, the difference is that Wittgenstein offered no explanations
or panaceas. He merely stayed out of the fray: there is no indication that
he ever read T. S. Eliot or Ezra Pound, D. H. Lawrence or W. H. Auden, and,
with the exception of John Maynard Keynes, he studiously avoided Bloosmbury.
As Ray Monk puts it, &quot;There was little common ground between the peculiarly
English, self-consciously 'civilized' aestheticism of Bloomsbury and the
[Cambridge] Apostles, and Wittgenstein's rigorously ascetic sensibility
and occasionally ruthless honesty.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#18"  TARGET="resource window">18</A>)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
When, in his notebooks and lectures, Wittgenstein does comment directly
about the nature of &quot;art,&quot; his remarks tend to be modernist commonplaces.
&quot;A work of art,&quot; he observed in 1930, &quot;forces us--as one
might say--to see it in the right perspective but, in the absence of art,
the object is just a fragment of nature like any other&quot; (CV 4). Here
Wittgenstein echoes, no doubt unwittingly, Viktor Shklovsky's famous doctrine
of &quot;making it strange&quot; or &quot;defamiliarization,&quot; with
its emphasis on the &quot;artistic&quot; removal of the object from its
usual surroundings so as to recharge its potency, the object itself being
&quot;unimportant.&quot; Or again, Wittgenstein will pay lip service to
the romantic / modernist doctrine of artistic uniqueness: &quot;Every artist
has been influenced by others and shows traces of that influence in his
works; but his significance for us is nothing but <I>his</I> personality&quot;
(CV 23).<BR>
<BR>
One does not, then, go to Wittgenstein for a systematic poetics. His writing
(so much of it not <I>his</I> writing at all but a recreation of his talk
made by his students and colleagues) has nothing interesting to say about
the &quot;big&quot; issues like &quot;the aesthetic,&quot; much less the
specifics of tropes or genres, fictionality or narrative form, sound structures
or verse forms. No wonder, then, that theory (as opposed to formal philosophy,
on the one hand, poetry on the other) has largely ignored Wittgenstein's
existence. The <I>Tractatus </I>(1922), for example, seems to have been
wholly unknown to the Russian Formalists, the Prague Linguistic Circle,
and the Frankfurt School of the thirties, even though Wittgenstein's questions
about language and culture had so much in common with, say, Roman Jakobson's
or Walter Benjamin's. No doubt, this neglect has much to do with the original
presentation and reception of Wittgenstein's book: the <I>Tractatus</I>
<I>Logico-Philosophicus</I> was, after all, first presented to the world
by Bertrand Russell (in C. K. Ogden's translation) as a treatise on the
logical structure of propositions and the nature of logical inference. As
such, its interest was for philosophers and mathematicians--hardly for literary
theorists.<BR>
<BR>
Benjamin, in any case, died long before the <I>Philosophical Investigations</I>
were published in 1952. But Theodor Adorno, who read it soon after publication,
was generally hostile to this book as he was to the <I>Tractatus</I>. In
<I>Against Epistemology</I>, he declares: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>As long as philosophy is no more than the cult of what 'is the
case,' in Wittgenstein's formula [the reference is to T #1.1, &quot;The
world is everything that is the case&quot;] it enters into competition with
the sciences to which in delusion it assimilates itself--and loses. If it
dissociates itself from the sciences, however, and in refreshed merriment
thinks itself free of them, it becomes a powerless reserve, the shadow of
shadowy Sunday religion. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#19" TARGET="resource window">19</A>)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
And, more pointedly, in <I>Hegel: Three Studies</I>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wittgenstein's maxim, 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one
must be silent' [T #7], in which the extreme of positivism spills over into
the gesture of reverent authoritarian authenticity, and which for that reason
exerts a kind of intellectual mass suggestion, is utterly antiphilosophical.
If philosophy can be defined at all, it is an effort to express things one
cannot speak about, to help express the nonidentical despite the fact that
expressing it identifies it at the same time. Hegel attempts to do this.
<FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#20" TARGET="resource window">20</A>)</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>
Here, as I shall be suggesting in later chapters, a critique like Adorno's
mistakes the famous (perhaps too-famous) conclusion of the <I>Tractatus</I>.
Far from being a &quot;gesture of reverent authoritarian authenticity,&quot;
Wittgenstein's aphorism &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must
be silent&quot; is no more than the common-sense recognition that there
are metaphysical and ethical aporias that no discussion, explication, rationale,
or well-constructed argument can fully rationalize-- even for oneself. In
this sense, Wittgenstein's &quot;philosophy&quot; is indeed intentionally
&quot;antiphilosophical,&quot; its purpose being precisely to determine
in what circumstances philosophy should be &quot;against&quot; philosophy
and why.<BR>
<BR>
The refusal, in any case, of the &quot;effort to express things one cannot
speak about&quot; has made Wittgenstein equally suspect (if not merely irrelevant)
in French post-structuralist circles. This is not the place to take up the
vexed question of Wittgenstein's relationship to Jacques Derrida; suffice
it to say that whatever homologies betwen the two have been posited, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#21" TARGET="resource window">21</A>)</FONT>
Wittgenstein plays little role in the work of Derrida or Michel Foucault,
Maurice Blanchot and Roland Barthes, Gilles Deleuze and Paul De Man. And
in such rare exceptions as Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard's <I>The Differend</I>
(1983), a book that not only cites Wittgenstein on page after page but even
models its discourse on his short, numbered aphoristic units, the Wittgensteinian
proposition is given a curious moral spin. Consider Lyotard's preliminary
definition: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>As distinguished from a litigation, a differend <I>[diff&eacute;rend</I>]
would be a case of conflict, between (at least) two parties, that cannot
be equitably resolved for lack of a rule of judgement applicable to both
arguments. One side's legitimacy does not imply the other's lack of legitimacy.
However, applying a single rule of judgment to both in order to settle their
differend as though it were merely a litigation would wrong (at least) one
of them (and both of them if neither side admits this rule). Damages result
from an injury which is inflicted upon the rules of a genre of discourse
but which is reparable according to those rules. A wrong results from the
fact that the rules of the genre of discourse by which one judges are not
those of the judged genre or genres of discourse.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#22" TARGET="resource window">22</A>)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
This sounds Wittgensteinian enough, Lyotard concluding the paragraph with
the assertion that &quot;a universal rule of judgment between heterogeneous
genres is lacking in general&quot; (DIF xi). But this seeming rejection
of essentialism is more apparent than real for the Lyotardian &quot;differend&quot;
is less a paradox than a sophistry. For example: &quot;To have 'really seen
with his own eyes' a gas chamber would be the condition which gives one
the authority to say that it exists and to persuade the unbeliever. Yet
it is still necessary to prove that the gas chamber was used to kill at
the time it was seen. The only acceptable proof that it was used to kill
is that one died from it. But if one is dead, one cannot testify that it
is on account of the gas chamber&quot; (DIF 3).<BR>
<BR>
Wittgenstein would have dismissed this &quot;argument&quot; as specious.
Since when, to begin with, is our &quot;knowledge&quot; of what happened
in the past based primarily on what we have &quot;seen with our own eyes&quot;?
As for the meaning of the term &quot;gas chamber,&quot; &quot;We may say:
only someone who already knows how to do something with it can significantly
ask a name&quot; (PI 31). To ask whether a gas chamber could cause death,
in other words, is to admit the gas chamber's existence. Thus the doubt
as to its efficacy says more about the questioner than about the gas chamber's
purpose. &quot;The definition . . . will depend on the circumstances under
which it is given, and on the person I give it to&quot; (PI 29).<BR>
<BR>
The reliance on common sense and context displayed in these propositions,
the repeated demonstration that &quot;the meaning of a word [e.g. &quot;gas
chamber&quot;] is its use in the language&quot; (PI 43) has evidently proved
to be a stumbling block, even for those deconstructionist theories which
take language to be a differential system. The criterion of <I>use</I>,
we read in one of the less genial passages in <I>The Differend</I>, is &quot;prey
to anthropological empiricism&quot; (DIF 76). Like Adorno, Lyotard cannot,
in the end, accept the anti-closural bent of Wittgenstein's investigative
mode, his refusal to press toward theoretical definition. A similar discomfort
may well motivate such Anglo-American Marxist critics as Raymond Williams,
David Harvey and Fredric Jameson--critics who have largely ignored Wittgenstein's
existence. In his important early critique of Russian Formalism <I>The Prison-House
of Language</I> (1972), Jameson groups Wittgenstein with the Formalists
under the &quot;empiricist&quot; umbrella, arguing that &quot;The vice of
Anglo-American empiricism lies indeed in its stubborn will to isolate the
object in question from everything else, whether it be a material thing,
an 'event' in Wittgenstein's sense, a word, a sentence, or a 'meaning'.&quot;
Indeed, given his own Marxist conviction that &quot;philosophy [must] include
within itself a theory of its own particular situation,&quot; Wittgenstein
is found wanting, for &quot;what the philosopher is describing is not language
in the absolute, but only the peculiar linguistic habits of philosophers.&quot;
<FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#23" TARGET="resource window">23</A>)</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
Ironically, this distinction is quite accurate, the odd thing being that,
as late as 1972 when these words were written, a theory of &quot;language
in the absolute&quot; should still have been considered a desirable possibility.
Jameson may well have been thinking of Heidegger, whose philosophy does
&quot;include within itself a theory of its own particular situation,&quot;
and who, unlike Wittgenstein, had specifically written on poetic subjects,
most notably in his now classic essays on H&ouml;lderlin. But with the breakdown
of disciplinary boundaries that has characterized the last decade, a shift
is beginning to occur, a shift, I shall want to argue, poets, novelists,
dramatists, and artists had anticipated a good deal earlier. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You often quote Wittgenstein--why is that?&quot;, an interviewer asked
the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu in 1985. And Bourdieu replied, &quot;Wittgenstein
is probably the philosopher who has helped me most at moments of difficulty.
He's <I>a kind of saviour for times of great intellectual distress</I> --
as when you have to question such evident things as 'obeying a rule'. Or
when you have to describe such simple (and, by the same token, practically
ineffable) things as putting a practice into practice.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#24" TARGET="resource window">24</A>)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Strong words, these, coming as they do from a writer as &quot;scientific&quot;
and as generally impersonal as Bourdieu. No doubt the &quot;times of great
intellectual distress&quot; are associated in Bourdieu's mind with what
he dismissively refers to, in the same interview, as &quot;the totalizing
ambition that is usually identified with philosophy&quot; (PBOW 19). For
example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>I've always had a pretty ambivalent relationship with the Frankfurt
School: the affinities between us are clear, and yet I felt a certain irritation
when faced with the aristocratic demeanor of that totalizing critique which
retained all the features of grand theory, doubtless so as not to get its
hands dirty in the kitchens of empirical research. The same goes for the
Althusserians, and for those interventions, both simplistic and peremptory,
that philosophical arrogance enables people to make. (PBOW 19).</BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Totalizing critique,&quot; &quot;grand theory&quot;--in our post-Marxist
era, these have increasingly come under suspicion. &quot;I wanted,&quot;
says Bourdieu, &quot;to reintroduce agents that L&eacute;vi-Strauss and
the structuralists, among others Althusser, tended to abolish, making them
into simple epiphenomena of structure. And I mean agents, not subjects.
Action is not the mere carrying out of a rule, or obedience to a rule. Social
agents, in archaic societies as well as in ours, are not automata, regulated
like clocks, in accordance with laws which they do not understand&quot;
(PBOW 9). <BR>
<BR>
The critique of &quot;grand theory&quot; with its concomitant turn to the
examination of the &quot;ordinary,&quot; has been carried further in the
remarkable writings of Jacques Bouveresse. In half a dozen books, written
between the early 1970s and the present, Bouveresse has painstakingly distinguished
Wittgenstein's writings from those of logical positivism on the one hand
and Husserlian phenomenology on the other. His close readings of the <I>Tractatus</I>
and the <I>Philosophical Investigations </I>trace Wittgenstein's dismantling
of the metaphysical tradition &quot;in order to preach and practice the
spirit of radical poverty in philosophy,&quot; and he remarks that Wittgenstein's
way of tackling philosophical problems is best called &quot;aesthetic&quot;
in its imaginative deployment of exempla, apposite images, parataxes, and
sudden leaps of faith. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#25" TARGET="resource window">25</A>)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
In this regard, Bouveresse's Wittgenstein recalls Stanley Cavell's. Indeed,
among Anglo-American philosophers, Cavell is surely the central disseminator
of the notion that, in the case of Wittgenstein, the &quot;philosophical&quot;
and the &quot;literary&quot; are inseparable. In <I>This New but Unapproachable
America</I> (1987), for example, Cavell writes movingly of Wittgenstein's
anti-totalizing stance, his &quot;leaving the world as it is,&quot; which
he relates to Heidegger's <I>Gelassenheit.</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#26" TARGET="resource window">26</A>)</FONT>
For Wittgenstein, he argues, the most &quot;simple&quot; thing--like &quot;putting
a practice into practice,&quot; as Bourdieu puts it--is understood to be
the most ineffable. The <I>Investigations,</I>&quot; writes Cavell, &quot;exhibits,
as purely as any work of philosophy I know, philosophizing as a spiritual
struggle, specifically a struggle with the contrary depths of oneself, which
in the modern world will present themselves in touches of madness&quot;
(SCUA 37). Cavell is referring to the struggle between competing emphases
in the consideration of human discourse--&quot;an emphasis on its distrust
of language or an emphasis on its trust of ordinary human speech&quot; (SCUA
32). Both emphases are quite proper and therein madness lies for which is
it to be? Ordinary language procedures, Cavell notes, &quot;inherently partake
of the uncanny&quot; (SCUA 47), for example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of course, if water boils in a pot, steam comes out of the pot
and also pictured steam comes out of the pictured pot. But what if one insisted
on saying that there must also be something boiling in the picture of the
pot? (PI #297)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here logic is indeed both foolproof and perhaps therefore slightly mad.
<BR>
<BR>
And Cavell proceeds, as he did in his earlier studies, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#27" TARGET="resource window">27</A>)</FONT>
to relate Wittgenstein's sense of &quot;poverty as a condition of philosophy&quot;
to Emerson's &quot;recognition of the power of ordinary words . . . to be
redeemed, to redeem themselves&quot; (SCUA 82). <BR>
<BR>
The emphasis on spiritual struggle and redemption should not, however, obscure
what we might call the <I>c&ocirc;t&eacute; avant garde</I> of Wittgenstein,
the obsession, not only with the &quot;power of ordinary words,&quot; as
in Emerson's case, but with their <I>strangeness:</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Imagine that a child was quite specially clever, so clever that
he could at once be taught the doubtfulness of the existence of all things.
So he learns from the beginning: &quot;That is probably a chair.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And now how does he learn the question: &quot;Is it also really a chair?&quot;
(Z #411)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Such riddling is what Guy Davenport seems to have in mind when he links
the author of the <I>Tractatus </I>to Kafka. This Wittgenstein is an obsessively
playful grammarian, whose riddling, disconnected sentence sequences bring
to mind those of a fellow avant-gardist Wittgenstein never read, never met
(and would probably have thoroughly disliked if he had met!) --namely Gertrude
Stein. &quot;Strangely simultaneous in their stylistic concerns,&quot; writes
Guy Davenport in <I>The Geography of the Imagination,</I> &quot;the two
were at work from 1917 onwards on identical linguistic phenomena: the splashed
meaning of chattered language, language which is gesture, politeness, and
social formula. . . . Gertrude Stein is not interested in the absurdity
of language but in the astounding implications that can be flushed from
its ordinariness.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#28" TARGET="resource window">28</A>)</FONT>
And Davenport cites the early Stein play <I>An Exercise in Analysis </I>(1917),
which ends with the lines: <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#29" TARGET="resource window">29</A>)</FONT>

&quot;Call me,&quot; &quot;Call me Ellen&quot;-- no sentences could be more
&quot;ordinary&quot; and yet &quot;call me&quot; means one thing in Act
III and quite another in Act IV when it is followed by a proper name, Ellen.
In the first instance, we could substitute &quot;phone&quot; for &quot;call,&quot;
but obviously the construction &quot;Phone me Ellen&quot; (without a pause,
represented in writing by a comma, after &quot;me&quot;) makes no sense.
A similar situation obtains in the case of &quot;Not disappointed&quot;
and &quot;Not in there&quot;: the first &quot;not&quot; functions as a qualifier,
the second as a more emphatic negative, as the stress and pitch contour
of the sentences suggests. And further: these two acts (or &quot;parts&quot;)
have no visible relationship to Acts III and IV. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Distrust of grammar,&quot; Wittgenstein had posited in the early <I>Notes
on Logic</I>, &quot;is the first requisite of philosophizing&quot; (NB 106).
And, by extension, of poeticizing as well. For although the later Wittgenstein
was to argue that grammar is precisely the key to understanding a given
proposition, that there is no essence above and beyond a specific grammatical
structure, one nevertheless must &quot;distrust&quot; grammar in the sense
of interrogating it as stringently as possible. <BR>
<BR>
It is in this sense, that grammar may be said to replace theory. In 1931,
when his Cambridge colleague C. D. Broad was lecturing on the three &quot;theories
of truth&quot;-- the Correspondence Theory, the Coherence Theory and the
Pragmatic Theory-- Wittgenstein remarked dismissively, &quot;Philosophy
is not a choice between different 'theories.'&quot; For: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>We can say that the word ['truth'] has at least three different
meanings; but it is mistaken to assume that any one of these theories can
give the whole grammar of how we use the word, or endeavour to fit into
a single theory cases which do not seem to agree with it. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#30" TARGET="resource window">30</A>)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
In the same year, Gertrude Stein wrote in her &quot;Arthur A Grammar,&quot;
&quot;What is a grammar ordinarily. A grammar is question and answer answer
undoubted however how and about.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="witt_intro_footnotes.html#31" TARGET="resource window">31</A>)</FONT><BR>
&quot;Call me. Call me Ellen.&quot; Such conundrums provide a baseline for
a whole series of texts that act out, as it were, Wittgenstein's obsession
with the &quot;distrust of grammar.&quot; From the Stein of <I>Stanzas in
Meditation </I>to such post-World War II works as Samuel Beckett's <I>Watt</I>,
to Thomas Bernhard's <I>Wittgenstein's Nephew,</I> and Ingeborg Bachmann's
<I>Malina</I>, to the recent experiments in &quot;language poetry&quot;
and conceptual art, we find a poetics based on what Wittgenstein called
the &quot;enormously difficult&quot; &quot;synopsis of trivialities&quot;
(LEC1 26). For example: &quot;A dog believes his master is at the door.
But can he also believe his master will come the day after to-morrow?&quot;
(PI 174). &quot;Face to face with this literalness&quot; says the French
poet Claude Royet-Journoud, &quot;face to face with this manifestation of
a demented logic, you tell yourself that through the literal you can perhaps
recover a sense of your body and of the displacement of your body.&quot;

<P>&quot;The world which is baldly whatever is the case,&quot; writes Terry
Eagleton with reference to the famous opening sentence of the <I>Tractatus,</I>
&quot;whose value and meaning is always elusively elsewhere is familiar
enough to us from the great experimental art of the early twentieth century&quot;
(WTE 6-7). In exploring the relationships between Wittgenstein's own avant-garde
practices and those of his contemporaries and later versions, I want to
begin, as Wittgenstein himself began, with the composition of the <I>Tractatus</I>,
and specifically with that book's departure from the work of Wittgenstein's
mentor Bertrand Russell. The contrast between Russell and Wittgenstein in
the World War I years is particularly instructive, the former preaching
<I>on </I>war from the sidelines, the latter engaging <I>in </I>war in the
trenches, an engagement that led to the particular form the <I>Tractatus
</I>took. The status of the <I>Tractatus </I>as a war book as well as an
avant-garde one has received little attention from philosophers, whose central
concern has primarily been to make sense of the &quot;picture-theory&quot;
of language which Wittgenstein's &quot;treatise on logic&quot; expounds.
My own interest is less in what the <I>Tractatus </I>&quot; says&quot; about
propositionality, tautology, etc. than what it <I>is,</I> especially in
its later sections which break abruptly with the &quot;clarity&quot; of
its opening and turn to matters of ethics and religion in a series of gnomic
utterances--&quot;The world of the happy is quite another than that of the
unhappy&quot;(T 6.43); &quot;Not <I>how</I> the world is, is the mystical,
but <I>that </I>it is&quot; (6.44)-- whose formulations &quot;solve&quot;
nothing.<BR>
<BR>
The genesis of the <I>Tractatus </I>from the notebooks Wittgenstein kept
during the war is the subject of Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, I turn to the
great work of Wittgenstein's maturity, the <I>Philosophical Investigations.
</I>Again, I am less interested in the central &quot;argument&quot; of the
<I>Investigations </I>--a topic on which philosophers have produced a huge
library--than in what Cavell calls the &quot;spiritual struggle&quot; dramatized
in its pages, as well as in those earlier versions like the Cambridge lectures
of the early 1930s and the jottings collected in <I>The Blue and Brown Books,
</I>in which Wittgenstein tested and endlessly revised his formulations.
What makes Wittgenstein, in Bourdieu's words, such a &quot;saviour in times
of intellectual distress,&quot; is his gradual recognition that everything
happens exactly as it does, but that, at any given moment, we also conjecture
that it might have happened otherwise (see CV 37). In the same vein, the
question that has dogged literary theory throughout the twentieth century
--&quot;Is there a distinction between ordinary and literary language, and,
if so, what is it?&quot;-- disappears, Wittgenstein demonstrating (1) that
there is in fact <I>no</I> material difference, but that (2) the <I>use</I>
to which we put language varies so much that words and sentences become,
as it were, unfamiliar when they reappear in a new context. When I say &quot;I
have a pain,&quot; to take one of Wittgenstein's favorite examples, does
the word &quot;have&quot; mean the same thing as when I say &quot;I have
an apple&quot;? And since the &quot;pain&quot; in this sentence is obviously
&quot;mine&quot; (otherwise, how could I recognize it as pain?), why not
just use the single word &quot;Pain!&quot; to express my feelings?<BR>
<BR>
The concept of the &quot;language-game,&quot; which is as central to the
<I>Investigations</I> as it is ultimately undefinable, can be discussed
from at least four different, though interrelated, perspectives, all of
them applicable to the poems and fictions and art works produced in the
wake of Wittgenstein's writing: (1) the emphasis on the strangeness, the
enigmatic nature of everyday language; (2) the awareness that &quot;the
world is <I>my</I> world [which] shows itself in the fact that the limits
of the language (<I>the</I> language which I understand) mean the limits
of <I>my</I> world&quot; (T #5.62), a proposition the later Wittgenstein
never abandoned, although the solipsism of &quot;my&quot; gradually gave
way to &quot;our,&quot; to the continuous struggle everyone encounters in
the &quot;bumping of one's head&quot; against the walls of one's language-cage
in the drive to understand one's world; (3) the recognition of the self
as, in no small measure, a social construct, a cultural construction. Wittgenstein
was not a Marxist but, as we shall see, he shares with Marx and with later
cultural materialists, the notion that the languages of the self depend
on social context, culture, and class. &quot;The subject does not belong
to the world but it is a limit of the world&quot; (T #5.632). There is no
unique &quot;I&quot; (&quot;The thinking, presenting subject; there is no
such thing&quot; [T #5.63]), subjectivity always depending upon a language
that belongs to a culture long before it belongs to me. Language is thus
a set of rule-governed practices, but one that can be adapted in a myriad
ways. And finally (4), the discovery that there are no propositions of absolute
value, no causal or even temporal explanations. &quot;When we think of the
world's future, we always mean the destination it will reach if it keeps
going in the direction we can see it going in now; it does not occur to
us that its path is not a straight line but a curve, constantly changing
direction&quot; (CV 3e). Humean as this rejection of causality may sound,
it differs from Hume's skepticism in that, for Wittgenstein, such rejection
of &quot;straight lines&quot; is a compositional as well as an epistemological
principle, his own &quot;conclusions&quot; never being more than tentative,
open, and to-be-revised. <BR>
<BR>
Again--and here is where Wittgenstein's &quot;mysticism&quot; comes in--however
impossible it may be to formulate ethical principles, it <I>is </I>possible
to engage in ethical actions. In the &quot;Lecture on Ethics&quot; Wittgenstein
gave shortly after his return to Cambridge in 1929, he describes ethics
as the running against the boundaries of language and gives the following
example. If someone says, after a tennis game, &quot;I play badly but I
don't care to play better,&quot; this is not analogous to the sentence,
&quot;I behave badly but I don't care to behave better&quot; (PO 38-39).
The difference is clear to anyone who speaks English and suggests that we
know instinctively what it means to &quot;behave badly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The first two of these four perspectives--the strangeness of the ordinary
and the &quot;bumping of one's head&quot; against the limits of language--are
central to the work of Gertrude Stein, which I discuss in Chapter 3. Indeed,
the writings of both Stein and Wittgenstein represent a side of modernism
markedly different from the Futurist and Imagist collage paradigm, which
has set the stage for so much of the discussion of modernism: witness the
<I>parole in libert&agrave;</I> of Marinetti, which Stein takes on in her
own oblique, tongue-in-cheek manner. The other two--the social construction
of the subject, and the articulation of an ethics outside the norms of causality
or explanation-- come to the fore more fully in what Wittgenstein referred
to as the &quot;dark time&quot; in which he published the <I>Investigations.</I>
In Chapters 4 and 5, I take up the ethical dimensions of the language-game
as they manifest themselves in the works of three great postwar writers
whose names begin with &quot;B&quot;--Beckett (who had nothing to say about
Wittgenstein but writes the most Wittgensteinian of parables), and the two
Austrian writers Ingeborg Bachmann and Thomas Bernhard, for whom Wittgenstein's
method, transferred to narrative, became something of an obsession. <BR>
<BR>
In Wittgensteinian terms, Beckett's characters--<I>Watt</I> is my example--
suffer from what we might call a context disorder; Watt, for instance, doesn't
know what to do with orders like &quot;You may give the left-overs to the
dog,&quot; given that there is no dog on the premises. The &quot;resistance
to language,&quot; I argue in Beckett's case, must be understood in terms
of the &quot;language of Resistance,&quot; the elaborating game of coding
used by Beckett and his co-workers in the Underground in the early 1940s,
right before he began work on <I>Watt</I>. In this setting, the most ordinary
sentence--for example, the piano tuner's remark that &quot;The strings are
in flitters&quot;--becomes suspect. And in the postwar Austrian writing
of the following decades (Bachmann, Bernhard, to some extent Peter Handke),
incomplete sentences like &quot;Are you really . . .&quot; or &quot;Later
on we might. . . &quot; have the power to drive their users mad, as do proper
names like Ivan and Malina, Herman Pavilion and Ludwig Pavilion, Ungargasse
and Salzkammergut.<BR>
<BR>
Finally in Chapter 6, I turn to recent Wittgensteinian experiments, this
time in the United States, in the articulation of a poetics of everyday
life. I am less interested in &quot;influence,&quot; always a nebulous quality,
than in analogue. It is fascinating to see that Wittgenstein's stringent
and severe interrogation of language has provided an opening for the replacement
of the &quot;autonomous,&quot; self-contained, and self-expressive lyric
with a more fluid poetic paradigm-- a paradigm based on the recognition
that the poet's most secret and profound emotions are expressed in a language
that has always already belonged to the poet's culture, society, and nation,
the irony being that this &quot;belonging&quot; need not make the poetry
in question--Robert Creeley's and Rosmarie Waldrop's, Ron Silliman's and
Lyn Hejinian's, the <I>Fluxus</I> box or the Joseph Kosuth &quot;investigation&quot;--
any less moving. <BR>

As someone trained in literary criticism rather than philosophy, I make
no claim to contributing to the ongoing (and enormous) body of writing that
seeks to <I>explain</I> the difficult meanings in Wittgenstein's endlessly
riddling philosophical writings. Rather, I want to examine the relationship
of Wittgenstein's mode of <I>investigation</I>, in all its contradictoriness,
its stringent and severe self-revision and critique, its cryptic and aphoristic
formulations and epiphanies, to the &quot;ordinary language&quot; poetics
so central to our own time. For if, as Wittgenstein posits, &quot;Language
is not <I>contiguous</I> to anything else&quot; (LEC1 112), then, its most
trivial manifestations becomes interesting. For example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Someone who doesn't know English hears me say on certain occasions:
&quot;What marvelous light! [<I>Welch herrliche Beleuchtung!</I>]&quot;
He guesses the sense and now uses the exclamation himself, as I use it,
but without understanding the three individual words. Does he understand
the exclamation? (Z #150).</BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, does he? Questions like this one have no &quot;answer,&quot; at least
not a correct (or incorrect) one. They merely open up new spaces, as &quot;poetic&quot;
as they are &quot;philosophical,&quot; in which to take a deep breath. </BLOCKQUOTE>
