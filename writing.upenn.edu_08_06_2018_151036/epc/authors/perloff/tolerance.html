  <P><FONT size=+2 COLOR="#0000a6">Exoticism</FONT>, as Leiris knew, can
  take many forms, not the least of which is the contemporary urge to eliminate
  it once and for all, to demonstrate that we are all equal and that, so
  far as history goes, an enlightened &quot;we&quot; who live at the end
  of the twentieth century can see the hidden and not-so-hidden colonialism,
  racism, and sexism of the early twentieth century as in itself it really
  was. In her highly praised study <I>Gone Primitive</I> : <I>Savage Intellects,
  Modern Lives</I> (1990), for example, Marianna Torgovnick is scornful of
  Modernist definitions and ideas about the primitive, which &quot;all take
  the West as norm and define the rest as inferior, different, deviant, subordinate,
  and subordinatable.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#2" TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</FONT>&quot;We
  simply do not have,&quot; she mourns, &quot;a neutral, politically acceptable
  vocabulary,&quot; the &quot;best we can do&quot; thus being &quot;to uncover,
  from a political and cultural perspective, the kinds of work key terms
  like <I>primitive</I> have performed within modern and postmodern culture
  and the kinds of work they have evaded and short-changed&quot; (GP 21).</P>
  <P>But of course words like &quot;evaded&quot; and &quot;short-changed&quot;
  are themselves loaded, suggesting that there is a correct (as in politically
  correct) way to regard &quot;the primitive&quot; and the &quot;work&quot;
  it <I>should </I>perform in our culture. Oddly--and I shall come back to
  this issue-- <I>Gone Primitive</I> seems to have learned little from a
  book that appeared just two years earlier and on which it is heavily dependent
  for its information, subject matter, and even its specific examples, namely
  James Clifford's <I>Predicament of Culture</I>. (1988), which argued eloquently
  that &quot;the words of ethnographic writing ... cannot be construed as
  monological, as the authoritative statement about, or interpretation of,
  an abstracted, textualized reality.&quot; 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#3" TARGET="resource window">3</A>)</FONT>
  When Torgovnick does cite Clifford, it is to remark (accurately enough)
  about his omission of the role gender plays in the construction of &quot;the
  primitive,&quot; an omission that places Clifford in the long line of those
  first-world male (and sometimes, like Margaret Mead, even female) ethnographers
  who have victimized the Other. 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#4" TARGET="resource window">4</A>) </FONT>Thus,
  in an ironic reversal, the ethnographer takes the place of the &quot;primitive&quot;
  in the &quot;them&quot; versus &quot;us&quot; game. </P>
  <P>Fieldwork, in this scheme of things, is devalued as old-fashionedly
  empiricist, as is any sort of first-hand experience of ethnographic acts
  and their objects of investigation, the knowledge, for starters, of the
  languages, both of the investigators and the investigated. The preferred
  method is to know what one wants to prove-- in this case, that Modernism
  was riddled with racism, sexism, and colonialism, and then to proceed to
  collect one's supporting exempla, the game being to ignore all &quot;evidence&quot;
  that might point in a contrary direction. Ironically, then, we are now
  witnessing an increasing body of scholarship on oppressed groups that,
  in its zeal to track down the oppressors, reinscribes the very oppression
  and subordination it seeks to descry. And further: such would-be oppositional
  discourse curiously reverts to the very binary model post-structuralist
  critics have assiduously claimed to be undermining. In what follows, I
  take Torgovnick's interrogation of Modernist primitivism as my example.
  </P>
  <P>Chapter 5 of <I>Gone Primitive</I> , &quot;The Many Obsessions of Michel
  </P>
  <P>Leiris&quot; begins with with the following thumbnail sketch:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Michel Leiris is a French novelist, poet, and man of letters, but also
    and by profession, an ethnographer who has written a massive and important
    book on African art. Intellectually, he has traveled with his culture,
    moving from Surrealism in the twenties and thirties, to Existentialism
    after World War II, to, more recently, a poststructuralist concern with
    language. He has been the intellectual bridesmaid of figures better known
    in this country, like Georges Bataille and Jean-Paul Sartre. (GP 105)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Whatever audience Torgovnick is writing for here, surely it cannot be
  an audience in any way familiar with French literature or culture, much
  less with Michel Leiris or problems of African ethnography. &quot;A graduate
  seminar at Duke in Spring 1988,&quot; explains this professor of English
  in her Preface, &quot;was indefatigable in providing me with information
  and with evidence that primitivism was everywhere present in contemporary
  culture&quot; (GP x). Hers, one surmises, is a projected readership not
  likely to be offended by such inaccuracies as that Leiris was a &quot;bridesmaid&quot;
  (an odd vulgarism) of Sartre, or that Leiris's interest in language <I>followed
  </I>his Surrealist phase (which was, incidentally, never fully Surrealist),
  when in fact it coincided with it. And further: only a fairly narrowly
  drawn American audience would not question Torgovnick's assertion that
  the &quot;best-known work in English on Leiris,&quot; a special issue of
  <I>SubStance</I>, edited by Jean-Jacques Thomas , conceives of the writer
  as &quot;ethnographic hero&quot; and ignores (in the case of Mary Ann Caws's
  essay) his terrible mysogny. What Torgovnick doesn't say is that this issue
  appeared as long ago as 1975 when gender theory was in its infancy and
  that, from the sixties to the present, a rich secondary literature on Leiris
  has come into being, critics from Maurice Blanchot, Philip Lejeune, and
  Susan Sontag to Rosalind Krauss, James Clifford and Dennis Hollier writing
  major commentary on this complex and brilliant writer. 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#5" TARGET="resource window">5</A>)</FONT> </P>
  <P>Then, too, the cultural production Torgovnick investigates seems oddly
  unrelated to questions of the actual production and reception of Leiris's
  autobiography. The critic bases her entire reading of Leiris <I>Manhood</I>
  (<I>L'Age d'homme</I>, 1939) on its &quot;inspiring icon&quot; in the form
  of Lucas Cranach's diptych <I>Lucrece and Judith</I>, reproduced on the
  book's cover (see GP 109). But although Cranach's diptych is indeed central
  to Leiris's autobiography, the original 1939 edition published in Paris
  by Gallimard does not reproduce the painting at all (it first appeared
  in the 1946 edition, where <I>L'Age d'homme</I> is preceded by the introductory
  essay, &quot;De la litt&eacute;rature consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme une
  tauromachie&quot;), whereas the 1966 Livre de Poche edition has on its
  cover a blown-up detail of Judith's torso, the gender of the headless figure,
  holding what seems to be its own head in its left hand, being ambiguous;
  and the 1973 Folio paperback edition depicts Judith as a semi-abstract
  playing-card figure, a kind of Queen of Hearts. 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#6" TARGET="resource window">6</A>)</FONT> Indeed, the first time Cranach's Lucrece and Judith
  become, so to speak, Leiris cover girls is in the 1984 North Point Press
  translation by Richard Howard (a translation originally published by Grossman
  in 1968). And when the University of Chicago Press recently reissued this
  edition, North Point having gone out of business, the cover design and
  format were retained. </P>
  <P>Leiris's &quot;mysogynist&quot; cover (which was not in fact his cover
  at all) thus finds itself juxtaposed to Torgovnick's own Chicago cover,
  in her case of Man Ray's photograph <I>Kiki</I> (also called <I>Noire et
  blanche</I>) of 1926, an egregious example, no doubt, of Modernist &quot;primitivism,&quot;
  in its juxtaposition of the oval head of Man Ray's sleeping mistress (Kiki)
  to the oval African mask with its sightless eyes, both the &quot;white&quot;
  face, underneath jet black hair, and the black mask, silhouetted against
  Kiki's naked white arm and shoulder, being rendered as fetishized objects
  controlled by the male artist-photographer Man Ray. What the Leiris--Man
  Ray juxtaposition masks, however, is that, unlike Man Ray, whose passionate
  love life was legendary, Michel Leiris had, by his own account, enormous
  sexual difficulties and his erotic fantasies of dismemberment, far from
  being directed outward, say, toward African women who would have to submit
  to his will, were primarily directed at his own person.</P>
  <P>The aim of Torgovnick's chapter, in any case, is to debunk the myth
  of Leiris as &quot;intellectual hero,&quot; a term I have never seen applied
  to Leiris but which Torgovnick uses a number of times interchangably with
  &quot;postmodern ethnographic hero.&quot; Although in his famous essay
  of 1950, &quot;L'ethnographe devant le colonialisme,&quot; Leiris &quot;correctly&quot;
  (the word is Torgovnick's) &quot;notes the colonized would begin to 'speak
  back' to the once monologic West,&quot; and although Leiris &quot;admirably&quot;
  (again her word) &quot;maintains that the ethnographer's role should be
  that of facilitating the future that the formerly colonized imagine for
  themselves&quot; (GP 106), such &quot;admirable&quot; and &quot;correct&quot;
  ideas are evidently not enough to redeem a writer whose early autobiographical
  work <I>Manhood </I>, when read in conjunction with the ostensibly anti-colonialist
  <I>African Art</I> (1967), reveals &quot;a spillage between sexuality and
  Western interest in African art-- a spillage we too often take for granted,
  and take for granted to our shame&quot; (GP107).</P>
  <P>Let us see what we should be ashamed about. <I>Manhood</I>, Torgovnick
  claims, cannot just be read as an arresting fictionalized autobiography;
  on the contrary, &quot;the terms Leiris chooses for his exposure of self
  should be taken seriously and count as facts about his brand of primitivism,
  even if they are 'invented' or 'constructed' facts&quot; (GP 108). The
  word <I>facts</I> is interesting in this context. One such &quot;fact,&quot;
  evidently, is Leiris's reading of Cranach's <I>Lucrece and Judith</I>,
  a double painting that, so the author tells us, represents the two erotic
  poles that haunted his adolescence and young manhood. Here, taken out of
  its context which I shall discuss in a moment, is Leiris's description:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>the first, Lucrece, pressing to the center of her white chest, between
    two marvelously hard round breasts (whose nipples seem as rigid as the
    stones decorating a gorget or cuirass at the same place), the narrow blade
    of a dagger whose tip is already beaded, like the most intimate gift appearing
    at the end of the male member, with a few drops of blood, and about to
    annihilate the effect of the rape she has suffered by a similar gesture:
    one that will thrust into a warm sheath of flesh, and for a bloody death,
    the weapon at its maximum degree of stiffness, like the rapist's inexorable
    virility when it enters by force the orifice already gaping between her
    thighs, the gentle pink wound that soon after returned the libation in
    full measure, just as the wound--deeper, wickeder too, but perhaps even
    more intoxicating-- made by the dagger will release, from Lucrece's very
    heart as she faints or fails, a torrent of blood;</P>
    <P>the second, Judith, in her right hand a sword naked as herself, its
    point piercing the ground close to her slender toes and its firm broad
    blade having just severed Holofernes' head, which hangs, sinister trophy,
    from the heroine's left hand, fingers and hair mingled in hideous union--Judith,
    wearing a necklace as heavy as a convict's chain, whose coldness around
    her voluptuous neck recalls that of the sword close to her feet--Judith,
    placid and already seeming to ignore the bearded ball she holds like a
    phallic glans she could have sundered merely by pressing her legs together
    with Holofernes' floodgates opened; or which, an ogress at the height of
    her madness, she might have cut from the powerful member of the drunken
    (and perhaps vomiting) man with a sudden snap of her teeth. (GP 94-95)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Interestingly, Cranach's paintings have little of the violence and horror
  that Leiris ascribes to them; his astonishing ekphrasis teases out meanings
  largely submerged if not absent in the diptych, where the myths are primarily
  vehicles for the painter's exhibition of the female body in all its sensuous
  nudity. The reference to Judith's &quot;fingers and [Holofernes'] hair
  mingled in hideous union,&quot; for instance, is a pure invention on Leiris's
  part, the calm expression on Judith's lovely face all but belieing what
  has just taken place. But Torgovnick pays no attention to these anomalies,
  concerned as she is with what she takes to be the &quot;repellent&quot;
  &quot;pornographic violence&quot; of Leiris's description, and concluding
  that he must have come to ethnography &quot;via sensual associations very
  much like those which attract him to Cranach's Lucrece and Judith.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#7" TARGET="resource window">7</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>Accordingly, when she reads the later, seemingly objective account in
  <I>African Art</I> of the tribal signification of scarification and tattooing,
  as well as of circumcision and, in the case of young women, excision of
  the clitoris and the <I>labia maiora</I>, Torgovnick detects an ulterior
  motive. Leiris is not, she argues, writing a disinterested account of African
  tribal customs; he is enjoying what she calls the &quot;prophylactic effect&quot;
  inherent in his &quot;ethnographic approach to the primitive&quot; (GP
  114). Like Judith and Lucrece, the native women described with seeming
  scientific detachment, cannot &quot;talk back,&quot; the male viewer thus
  being able to gaze at them voyeuristically. &quot;They are object; he is
  subject. He is in control, empowered, unthreatened&quot; (GP 114). The
  attraction of Africa for Leiris turns out to be pornographic, a vehicle
  for his diseased sexual fantasies about women. Such ethnographic work,
  Torgovnick concludes, is finally &quot;perverse,&quot; a model we who are
  enlightened must abjure. Its &quot;structures of mastery&quot; must give
  way to those of &quot;mutuality; a reaching out to the natural world as
  our home and mother, not the exploitation of that world for profit.&quot;
  &quot;Primitive societies,&quot; after all, should be &quot;allowed to
  exist in their own times and spaces, within their own <I>conceptions of</I>
  time and space, not transposed and filtered into Western terms.&quot; Indeed,
  a correct history of primitive societies would acknowledge these societies
  &quot;as full and valid alternatives to Western cultures&quot; (GP 247).</P>
  <P>On what planet, one wonders, do these Utopian conditions obtain? Where
  are the &quot;structures of mutuality,&quot; where the &quot;natural world&quot;
  is &quot;our home and mother,&quot; where each society exists &quot;in
  [its] own time and space&quot;? Not, assuredly, in Leiris's France, a France
  that during the writer's highschool years was engaged in the horrific trench
  warfare of World War I, a France, moreover, that by the time he published
  <I>Manhood</I> was months away from the Nazi occupation of World War II.
  In these circumstances, &quot;structures of mutuality&quot; and &quot;full
  and valid alternatives&quot; (themselves, incidentally, nothing if not
  Western post-Enlightenment norms) may have seemed just slightly out of
  reach. </P>
  <P>Here is where history comes in, history which is the great absence in
  the branch of cultural studies practiced by Torgovnick. 
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#8" TARGET="resource window">8</A>)</FONT> Her reasoning goes something like this. (1) Enlightened
  narrative about so-called primitive societies is directly related to &quot;enlightened&quot;
  personal morality; (2) Leiris, judging from the revelations in his autobiography,
  revelations which must count as relevant &quot;facts&quot; in any assessment
  of his &quot;character,&quot; had curious sexual obsessions; therefore,
  (3), even though Leiris later writes explicitly and eloquently against
  colonialism, his accounts of such matters as African tattoo and scarification
  rituals are not to be trusted. To put it crudely: anyone so preoccupied
  with what well may be kinky sex and who persists in seeing sex in its relationship
  to death, cannot be the kind of &quot;ethnographic hero&quot; &quot;we&quot;
  want. </P>
  <P>I wish I could say my summary of Torgovnick's argument was simplified,
  but the fact is that the colonialist Joseph Conrad and the racist D. H.
  Lawrence, the voyeuristic Bronislaw Malinowski, and even the cowardly Margaret
  Mead who, despite her own lesbian leanings, &quot;stop[ped] short of explicitly
  writing against homophobia&quot; (GP 238)--all these are found wanting
  according to the severe Puritan yardstick applied to them in <I>Gone Primitive</I>.
  How Conrad's representations of the European experience of the Congo in
  the early century relate to other accounts of the period is considered
  beside the point, the point being, it seems, that Conrad refused to spell
  out what lay behind Kurtz's famous phrase, &quot;the horror, the horror,&quot;
  that he ignored &quot;ugly facts, facts like how those heads [of the natives]
  got on the palisade., facts like the African woman's relation to Kurtz&quot;
  (GP152). &quot;Conrad's version of the primitive,&quot; declares Torgovnick
  with great moral authority, &quot;is a cheat&quot; (GP 153). </P>
  <P>So, it seems, was the &quot;phantom Africa&quot; of Michel Leiris. Born
  in 1901, Leiris grew up in bourgeois comfort in Paris, where his father
  was a banker, seemingly insulated from the Great War which broke out, let
  us remember, when he was at the impressionable age of thirteen. Not that
  <I>Manhood</I> is overtly a war book. Indeed, its Foreword, &quot;De la
  litt&eacute;rature consid&eacute;r&eacute;e come une tauromachie&quot;
  (in the English translation, &quot;The Autobiographer as <I>Torero</I>&quot;
  becomes the Afterword), begins with the nonchalant reference to its author's
  coming to legal maturity &quot;four years after the war which like so many
  other boys of his generation, he had experienced as scarcely more than
  a long vacation&quot; (MLM 154; LD 9). But in the very next paragraph,
  we read, &quot;Now in 1939, when the young men of the post-war period see
  the utter collapse of that structure of facility which they despaired of
  trying to invest with not only an authentic fervor but a terrible distinction
  as well, the author freely acknowledges that his true 'manhood' still remains
  to be written, when he will have suffered, in one form or another the same
  bitter ordeal his elders faced.&quot; And on the following page, the narrative
  breaks off abruptly with the following remarks:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>This was the preface I was writing for<I>Manhood</I> on the eve of the
    &quot;phony war.&quot; I am rereading it today [evidently 1945] in Le Havre,
    a city I have often visited for a few days' vacation and to which I am
    bound by many old ties (my friends Limbour, Queneau, and Salacrou, who
    were born here; Sartre, who taught here and with whom I became associated
    in 1941 when most of the writers remaining in occupied France united against
    the Nazi oppression). Le Havre is now largely destroyed, as I can see from
    my balcony, which overlooks the harbor from a sufficient height and distance
    to give a true picture of the terrible <I>tabula rasa</I> the bombs made
    in the center of the city, as if there has been an attempt to repeat in
    the real world, on a terrain populated by living beings, the famous Cartesian
    operation. On this scale, the personal problems with which <I>Manhood</I>
    is concerned are obviously insignificant: whatever might have been, in
    the best cases, its strength and its sincerity, the poet's inner agony,
    weighed against the horrors of war, counts for no more than a toothache
    over which it would be graceless to groan.... (MLM 154-55; cf. LD 11)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Such speculations might have led to silence--the &quot;no poetry after
  Auschwitz&quot; stance. Or they might lead, as indeed they did, to the
  use of &quot;the toothache over which it would be graceless to groan&quot;
  and related aches and wounds as synecdoches and analogues for those &quot;horrors
  of war,&quot; and in a larger sense, horrors of being human, which are,
  in any case, always seen as paradoxical. &quot;Even in Le Havre,&quot;
  Leiris remarks in the Foreword, &quot;things continue, urban life persists.
  Above the still intact houses as above the site of the ruins there shines
  intermittently, despite the rainy weather, a bright, beautiful sun&quot;
  (MLM 155). Just so, the imagery of death, of shame and horror, of the abject
  which is so prominent in <I>Manhood</I> is made poignant by its association
  with desire and pleasure, with the longing for voluptuous gratification.
  And to complicate matters further, what makes modern &quot;civilized&quot;
  urban life so terrifying is that the orderly and familiar rituals of bourgeois
  family life to which the child is exposed, the boredom of normal everyday
  existence provide only the flimsiest screen for the violence beneath the
  surface. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#9" TARGET="resource window">9</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>In assessing Leiris's authorial position in <I>African Art</I>, read
  retrospectively in the light of his autobiography, Torgovnick writes &quot;They
  [the African women] are object; he is subject. He is in control, empowered,
  unthreatened&quot; (GP 114). Presumably Leiris has this position because
  he is a white man, describing the tribal mutilation practices of black
  women. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#10" TARGET="resource window">10</A>)</FONT> But surely no one is
  less &quot;in control&quot; and &quot;unthreatened&quot; than the hero
  of <I>Manhood, </I>who, from the opening page of the book, presents himself
  as having a &quot;head ...rather large for my body,&quot; legs &quot;a
  little short for the length of my torso,&quot; and thin, hairy hands, &quot;the
  veins distinct; my two middle fingers, curving inward toward the tips,
  [which] must denote something rather weak and evasive in my character.&quot;
  And further: &quot;Sexually, I am not, I believe, abnormal--simply a man
  of rather cold temperament--but I have long tended to regard myself as
  virtually impotent. It has been some time, in any case, since I have ceased
  to consider the sexual act as a simple matter, but rather as a relatively
  exceptional event&quot; (MLM 5). Here is the personal predisposition that
  colors so many of the book's subsequent events and memories. </P>
  <P>Take the memory of the boy's first erection, which takes place when
  he is six or seven on a family picnic in the woods near Paris. &quot;The
  event which caused my excitement was the sight of a group of children ...
  climbing trees barefoot.... Much later, it seemed to me that the strange
  sensation I experienced then came from imagining what must have been both
  a pleasant and painful feeling for the children in question, the feeling
  caused by the contact of the soles of their feet and their bare toes with
  the rough bark&quot; (MLM 13-14). We may consider such confessions as,
  in Torgovnick's words, &quot;a disturbing reminder of how this linking
  of sex and violence ... pervades Western culture and provides a psyche
  like Leiris's with ready simulacra&quot; (MT 110). Or we may try to understand
  Leiris's collage of &quot;disturbing &quot;images as by no means &quot;simulacra,&quot;
  but, on the contrary, images with specific reference to a time and place
  when pretensions of protected childhood and &quot;civilized&quot; behavior,
  of paternal and Church authority and training, of fixed class-division
  and the seemingly incontrovertible gap between masters and servants--when
  all these cultural formations were playing themselves out against the backdrop
  of a world war that is a persistent but barely alluded to subtext. </P>
  <P>We can see this anomaly most clearly in the short sequence called &quot;Throat
  Cut,&quot; in the chapter &quot;The Head of Holofernes.&quot; The incident
  in question could hardly be more ordinary, and yet the autobiographer,
  who has presented his childhood self as acquiring his knowledge of violence
  and tragedy largely from spectatorship, whether at the opera, at the theatre,
  or in the museum, recalls it as &quot;the most painful of all my childhood
  memories&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>At the age of five or six, I was the victim of an assault. I mean that
    I endured an operation on my throat to remove certain growths; the operation
    took place in a very brutal manner, without my being anesthetized. My parents
    had first made the mistake of taking me to the surgeon without telling
    me where we were going. If my recollections are correct, I believed we
    were on the way to the circus; I was therefore far from anticipating the
    nasty trick about to be played on me by our family doctor, who assisted
    the surgeon, as well as by the latter himself. The occasion went off, point
    by point, like a play that had been rehearsed, and I had the feeling that
    I had been lured into a hideous ambush. Matters proceeded as follows: leaving
    my parents in the waiting room, the old doctor led me into another room
    where the surgeon was waiting for me, wearing a huge black beard and a
    white gown.... I saw various sharp instruments and must have looked frightened,
    for the old doctor took me on his lap and said to reassure me: &quot;Come
    here, <I>mon petit coco! </I>Now we're going to play kitchen.&quot; From
    this moment on I can remember nothing except the sudden assault of the
    surgeon, who plunged some kind of sharp instrument into my throat, the
    pain that I felt, and the scream--like that of a slaughtered animal--that
    I uttered. My mother, who heard me from the next room, was terrified.</P>
    <P>On the way home in the carriage, I did not speak a word; the shock had
    been so violent that for twenty-four hours it was impossible to get a word
    out of me; my mother, completely disoriented, wondered if I had become
    mute. All I can remember about the period immediately following the operation
    is the carriage ride, my parents' vain attempts to make me speak, and then,
    back at the house, my mother holding me in her arms in front of the living-room
    fireplace, the sherbets she had me swallow, the blood I spat up at each
    mouthful and which mingled with the rasberry color of the sherbets. (MLM
    64-65)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;My whole image of life,&quot; remarks Leiris, &quot;has been scarred
  by the incident: the world, full of traps, is nothing but a huge prison
  or an operating theatre; I am on earth only to become a specimen for doctors,
  cannon fodder, food for worms&quot; (MLM 65). What justifies this seemingly
  excessive response is that the incident in question depended on a terrible
  deception, on the collusion of the narrator's parents with the doctor's
  &quot;enlightened&quot; view that children are to be manipulated and coerced
  into acquiescence. But the curious phrase in the above sentence is &quot;cannon
  fodder&quot; (&quot;chair &agrave; canons,&quot; LD 112). The world as
  prison, as operating theatre: these classic metaphors emerge naturally
  from the situation of the tonsillectomy, but the image of &quot;cannon
  fodder&quot; relates the ordinary childhood incident to the extraordinary
  circumstance of the war outside the nursery. The child is lured by the
  promise of the circus just as the young medical student in Celine's <I>Voyage
  au bout de la nuit</I> is promised adventure and a beautiful uniform only
  to end up, like little Leiris, in the place of dismemberment, where the
  red of rasberry sorbets is mixed with blood.</P>
  <P>The memory of the throat operation foreshadows another seemingly trivial
  &quot;suburban&quot; incident : </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>One day a cousin whose parents lived in the villa next door to ours
    was bitten by a dog. One detail made me shudder: I was told that the bite
    had been so deep &quot;a piece of buttock had remained in the child's underwear.&quot;
    I cannot think of this cousin--who was subsequently killed in the war--without
    remembering what he was like when the incident occurred: a big, well-built,
    heavy-set boy whose parents adored him because he represented, from a certain
    point of view, the ideal of beauty and health, and whose chubby calves
    were the admiration of almost everyone in the family, except for my mother
    who said he was a &quot;big softy&quot; and thought her sons &quot;more
    delicate.&quot; (MLM 67) </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>It is against the backdrop of such incidents that we must understand
  the attraction-repulsion associated for Leiris with &quot;Lucrece the chaste
  and Judith the patriot prostitute&quot; as depicted in Cranach's double-painting:</P>
  <P>One might ... suspect that their two apparently distinct gestures were
  at bottom identical, and that both were supremely concerned to cleanse
  in blood the taint of an erotic act, the one expiating by her suicide the
  shame of having been violated (and perhaps of having enjoyed that violation),
  the other expiating by murder the shame of having prostituted herself to
  her victim. So that it would not be out of mere caprice, but by virtue
  of profound analogies, that Cranach painted the two as pendants, both similarly
  naked and desirable, at one in that complete absence of moral hierarchy
  which is the necessary concomitant of nakedness, and shown on the verge
  of committing particularly arousing actions... (93-94)</P>
  <P>&quot;The passage repels most,&quot; writes Torgovnick, &quot;by its
  suggestion that Lucrece enjoyed (must have enjoyed) her rape ... and its
  parallel suggestion that Judith castrates Holofernes to punish him for
  his sexuality, rather than kills him as a political act&quot; (GP 110).
  The either/or of the latter statement (i.e., it's either politics <I>or</I>
  sex) would be quite alien to Leiris's radius of discourse, but the former,
  with its very contemporary (and justified) complaint about the still-prevalent
  male assumption that women who are raped somehow &quot;want&quot; it, is
  also misconceived. The death of Cleopatra, who represents for Leiris, a
  kind of symbolic union of the Lucrece and Judith prototypes, is apposite
  here: &quot;on the one hand the murderous serpent, the male symbol par
  excellence--on the other the figs beneath which [the asp] was concealed,
  the common image of the female organ.... I cannot help noting with what
  exactitude this meeting of symbols corresponds to what for me is the profound
  meaning of suicide: to become at the same time <I>oneself and the other</I>,
  male and female, subject and object, killed and killer--the only possibility
  of communion with oneself.&quot; And Leiris relates this image of &quot;the
  right to love oneself to excess&quot; to that of Prometheus punished for
  having stolen fire&quot; (MLM 93). </P>
  <P>Leiris is not, then, subscribing to anything so vulgar as the patriarchal
  belief that woman is the subject who &quot;enjoys&quot; rape. He identifies,
  after all, not with Lucrece's rapist but with Lucrece; not with Holofernes
  but with Judith, his case being for the dissolution of gender boundaries
  in the love act and for the inseparability of eros and thanatos. The issue
  is not whether this particular vision of human sexuality is &quot;true&quot;
  or not but whether Leiris's powerful self-examination and pitiless self-critique
  carries conviction. The aim of <I>Manhood</I>, after all, is not to provide
  moral uplift or to present the reader with &quot;full and valid alternatives,&quot;
  but to depict an especially demonic (because so seemingly placid and bourgeois)
  world, the world of <I>entre deux guerres</I>, in all its excesses and
  contradictions.</P>
  <P>Can a writer of Leiris's kind be a &quot;good&quot; ethnographer and
  an important source for our understanding of the &quot;primitive&quot;?
  In the final chapter of <I>Manhood</I>, Leiris tells us that in response
  to a crisis period in his twenties, he decided to engage in &quot;a more
  strenuous life for a while,&quot; and &quot;went to Africa for almost two
  years, as a member of an ethnographical expedition. After months of chastity
  and emotional weaning, I fell in love while in Gondar with an Ethiopian
  woman who corresponded physically and morally to my double image of Lucrece
  and Judith&quot; (MLM 40). This woman's face, Leiris recalls, was &quot;beautiful
  but her breasts ravaged&quot;; she was &quot;wrapped in a filthy gray toga,
  smelled of sour milk, and owned a young Negro slave girl&quot;; he dwells
  further on the &quot;bluish tattoos around the neck of this &quot;syphilitic&quot;
  witch, and notes that &quot;Her clitoris extirpated, like all the women
  of her race, she must have been frigid, at least from a European point
  of view.&quot; &quot;I never,&quot; he concludes, &quot;made love to her,
  but when the sacrifice took place it seemed to me that a relation more
  intimate than any carnal link was established between her and myself&quot;
  (MLM 140).</P>
  <P>It is interesting to compare this retrospective description of the Gondar
  woman, to the diary version recorded just a few years earlier and published
  in <I>L'Afrique fant&ocirc;me</I> (1934). Emawayish, as the woman in question
  was called, was the daughter of Malkam Ayyahou, the charismatic leader
  of a group of initiates possessed by &quot;z&acirc;r&quot; genies. Leiris's
  entry for 25 August 1932 records a dark mood: &quot;Bitterness. Resentment
  against ethnography which makes you take so inhuman a position, that of
  an observer, in situations where it would be best to let go.&quot; <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#11" TARGET="resource window">11</A>)</FONT> As James Clifford recounts in his
  notes to the translation, &quot;Three days later, during an intense possession
  seance, Emawayish contrives to leave her mother, comes over to the bed
  on which Leiris is sitting and, in a gesture of apparent intimacy, places
  his hand under her armpit. The ethnographer is entranced by the songs she
  sings while posssessed and wants her to write them down so that he and
  his Ethiopian co-worker Abba J&eacute;rome can make translations&quot;
  (S 42). Here is the beginning of Leiris's entry for 31 August:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>During the morning, letter from Emawayish. She would be pleased if I
    made her a gift of a blanket. Quite a natural wish, following my courtly
    declarations of devotion ... I'll never accuse a native of venality. Just
    imagine how insanely wealthy a European must seem to such poor people and
    how they must look obsessively on his smallest objects of comfort, as if
    they were treasures! (S 42-43).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Leiris now brings Emawayish pens, ink, and a notebook &quot;so she can
  record for herself--or dictate to her son--the manuscript [of her songs]&quot;;
  he is upset that another member of the expedition, Lutten, for whom &quot;making
  love is only a matter of pleasure or hygiene!&quot;, wants to sleep with
  her, whereas he himself finds it &quot;impossible ... to treat love with
  nonchalance.&quot; Isolated, lonely, unable to find anyone to whom he &quot;can
  speak from the bottom of [his] heart,&quot; he is all but suicidal. When
  he urges her to record her love songs, Emawayish asks pointedly: &quot;<I>Does
  poetry exist in France?</I> &quot; And then, as if challenging Leiris's
  manhood: &quot;<I>Does love exist in France?&quot; </I>(S 43; AF 359).</P>
  <P>The very next entry (1 September) begins: &quot;Very bad night. First
  insomnia, then, very late, a little sleep,&quot; which is haunted by guilt
  dreams. &quot;During the day,&quot; Leiris notes, &quot;though tired and
  enervated, I feel better. I realize I've been overworked, that I've been
  too caught up with research in a dangerous area.&quot; And he admits his
  doubts as to the methods of gathering material, the poetry collected &quot;probably
  not as beautiful as I had thought, the possession states not as intense
  ... and also covering up quite a bit of merchandizing.... But above all,
  and in contradiction to all this, an ardent sensation of being at the edge
  of something whose depths I will never touch.&quot; Then, after describing
  Emawayish's belief that &quot;one of the spirits inhabiting the head of
  her mother is capable of killing her son,&quot; he remarks sadly that he
  cannot really enter her spirit world, &quot;imbued whatever I do with a
  civilization that leads one to give everything a moral rather than a magical
  tint. And this is the great boundary I will never cross&quot; (S 44; AF
  360). </P>
  <P>Is this the White Man whom Torgovnick takes to be wholly &quot;in control,
  empowered, unthreatened&quot; in his relation to African women? Who voyeuristically
  revels in the sight of their naked breasts and colorful tattoos? One wonders
  what sort of relationship between the Leiris of 1932 and this particular
  Ethiopian woman critics like Torgovnick would consider acceptable. The
  West, she asserts, might have developed a &quot;history in which primitive
  societies were allowed to exist in all their multiplicity, not reduced
  to a seamless Western fantasy.... when the majority of Euro-Americans can
  accept that our nations--for all their present comforts and power--exist
  on the same plane with other social and political entities&quot; (GP147).
  But perhaps this optimistic trust in an &quot;openness,&quot; so to speak
  by fiat, &quot;to alternative conceptions of knowledge and social reality&quot;
  is itself the ultimate &quot;seamless Western fantasy.&quot; </P>
  <P>How, asks James Clifford in a critique of Edward Said's <I>Orientalism</I>,
  &quot;can one ultimately escape procedures of dichotomizing, restructuring,
  and textualizing in the making of interpretive statements about foreign
  cultures and traditions?&quot; (JCP 261). If, that is to say, Said presents
  Orientalism as &quot;a corporate institution for dealing with the Orient,&quot;
  an institution which has, throughout the colonial period that extends from
  the late eighteenth century to the present, wielded the power of &quot;dominating,
  restructuring, and having authority over the Orient&quot; (JCP 259), how
  can his own account avoid the essentialism inherent in the unstated assumption
  that the &quot;oppressed&quot; Orient is in fact <I>not </I>like the one
  produced by the Orientalist myth? The critique of Orientalism presupposes,
  in other words, an Orient with such and such specific characteristics,
  characteristics which have been <I>misrepresented</I> by the West. And
  further: &quot;The Western culture of which Orientalism is an exemplar
  [is viewed] as a discrete entity capable of generating knowledge and institutional
  power <I>over</I> the rest of the planet. Western order, seen this way,
  is imperial, unrecipocral, aggressive, and potentially hegemonic&quot;
  (JCP 272). Against this binary opposition, an opposition Said himself begins
  to doubt as his argument proceeds, Clifford makes the case for a &quot;West&quot;
  that is itself &quot;a play of projections, doublings, idealizings, and
  rejections of a complex, shifting otherness.&quot; &quot;Europe,&quot;
  in this case, may be seen as, in its turn, a false stereotype of the Orient,
  the question being, in Clifford's words, &quot;How ... is an oppositional
  critique of Orientalism to avoid falling into 'Occidentalism'&quot;? (PC
  259). </P>
  <P>There are no easy answers to such questions. That colonialist &quot;fictions
  of the primitive&quot; have been used for at least a century to bolster
  the West's own self-image is incontrovertible. But that we can now enter
  a Utopia where we approach &quot;primitive&quot; cultures as &quot;full
  and valid alternatives&quot; to our own is perhaps an even more dangerous
  myth. If I have dwelt at such length on the argument of <I>Gone Primitive</I>,
  it is because this well-meaning study epitomizes the wrong turn the new
  &quot;cultural studies&quot; takes when it ignores both history and common
  sense. In her attack on Leiris, as on the &quot;primitivism&quot; of Conrad
  and Lawrence, Freud and Roger Fry, Malinowski and Mead, Torgovnick's root
  assumption is that a good writer (or ethnographer) is equivalent to a good
  person, and, concomitantly, that a &quot;good&quot; book is one which is
  the repository of the &quot;right&quot; cultural values. But, as John Guillory
  has recently argued, we must beware of equating &quot;the values expressed
  in a work with the value <I>of</I> the work, of assuming that a given work
  is simply the &quot;container of such and such values&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The reversion to moralism is determined by the equation of text-selection
    with value-selection. For this reason much of what passes for political
    analysis of historically canonical works is nothing more than the passing
    of moral judgment on them. The critique of the canon moves quickly to reassert
    absolutist notions of good and evil.... <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#12" TARGET="resource window">12</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>One thinks here, not only of a study of primitivism like Torgovnick's
  but such recent studies of minority writing as Cary Nelson's <I>Repression
  and </I>Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory
  <I>1910-1945</I> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), with its
  eloquent but ultimately absolutist replacement therapy, the canonical &quot;greats&quot;
  (Eliot, Pound, Frost, Stevens, Williams, etc.) being swept under the rug
  so as to make room for a large body of &quot;neglected&quot; and hence
  ipso facto &quot;deserving&quot; poets of the period: women, African-Americans,
  Communist activists. </P>
  <P>Perhaps a more satisfactory critique of primitivism and its analogues
  would begin with the recognition that primitivisms, like the modernisms
  to which they are related, can only be plural. How, to take just one example,
  does the Russian &quot;neo-primitivism&quot; of the artists Goncharova
  and Larionov, Tatlin and Malevich, or the poets Khlebnikov and Kruchenykh
  square with the &quot;primitivism&quot; of Leiris and his colleagues at
  the Paris Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie? Why does the Russian avant-garde's
  &quot;primitivist&quot; concern for peasant and folk art, the <I>lubok</I>
  (woodblock) and the icon, and the &quot;primitivist&quot; quest of Khlebnikov,
  &quot;To find the magic stone for transforming all Slavic words, the magic
  that transforms one into another without breaking the circle of verbal
  roots,&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#13" TARGET="resource window">13</A>)</FONT> take a spiritualist
  turn, so unlike the erotic &quot;primitivism&quot; of a Picasso, who gives
  two of his androgynous &quot;demoiselles d'Avignon&quot; African masks
  for faces? </P>
  <P>We cannot hope to address such questions without a consideration of
  history as well as geography. Khlebnikov, descended from Mongolian Buddhists
  who inhabited the grassy steppes on the west bank of the Caspian Sea, Khlebnikov
  the son of a prominent naturalist and ornithologist who studied the biological
  sciences and mathematics before he ever came to poetry in St. Petersburg,
  Khlebnikov, whose first publication in Petersburg (1908) was an anonymous
  manifesto posted in a university corridor, a call to defend the Slavic
  countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina against annexation by Austria, declaring
  : &quot;Holy War! Unavoidable, approaching, immediate--war for the trampled
  rights of the Slavs, I salute you! Down with the Hapsburgs! Hold back the
  Hohenzollerns!&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#14" TARGET="resource window">14</A>)</FONT>, was inevitably
  attracted to a home-grown &quot;primitivism&quot; quite alien to the disillusioned
  post-war musings of the author of <I>L'Afrique fant&ocirc;me</I>. Yet--and
  this is the irony-- Leiris's Surrealist compilation of language games and
  concrete poems called <I>Glossaire</I>, is nothing if not Khlebnikovian.
  Here is one such passage, published in <I>La R&eacute;volution surre&aacute;liste
  </I>in 1925:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>By dissecting the words we like, without bothering about conforming
    either to their etymologies or to their accepted significations, we discover
    their most hidden qualities and the secret ramifications that are propagated
    through the whole language, channeled by associations of sounds, forms,
    and ideas. Then language changes into an oracle and there we have a thread
    (however slender it may be) to guide us through the Babel of our minds.
    <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A HREF="tolerance_footnotes.html#15" TARGET="resource window">15</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This might be one of Khlebnikov's descriptions of <I>Zaum</I> (trans-rational)
  language, were it not that Khlebnikov takes etymology to be the key to
  <I>Zaum</I> language formation, a view that perhaps classifies the Russian
  poet as more of a &quot;primitivist&quot; than the primitivist Leiris.
  At the same time, Khlebnikov's primitivism has none of the eroticism central
  to Leiris's and it is hard to call it &quot;racist&quot; since the primitive
  race invoked and &quot;exoticized&quot; is Khlebnikov's own.</P>
  <P>But the <I>exotic</I> is, of course, always a contested site. I recall
  meeting Margaret Mead once, at a Washington dinner party in the sixties.
  She was wearing a long colorful cotton dress and lots of wooden jewelry,
  and she supported herself on a large shepherd's crook, which she tapped
  emphatically on the floor when she wanted to make a particular point. I
  found her extremely exotic-- a powerful, individual presence. Marianna
  Torgovnick, however, scolds her for such things as &quot;never fully mingl[ing]
  with the Samoans&quot; or for &quot;referring routinely to male graduate
  students as 'men' and females at the same stage of professional life as
  'girls'.&quot; It seems that the poor Margaret of memoir and historical
  record is not allowed to dwell, as are the &quot;primitives&quot; toward
  whom Torgovnick expresses such tolerance, in her &quot;own <I>conception
  of </I>time and space&quot;; nor is hers judged to be one of those &quot;full
  and valid&quot; alternatives&quot; the author wants us to respect. The
  &quot;full range of human sexual possibilities and variations in belief&quot;
  (GP 246)--these are evidently available only to the still-exotic Others.</P>
  <P>Surely there are more satisfying ways of approaching the Other. I conclude
  with some lines from &quot;Chapter 217&quot; of Lyn Hejinian's long poem
  <I>Oxota: A Short Russian Novel</I>, which tells the story of the American
  poet's gradual initiation into the otherness of the then Soviet Union:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Recognition in itself is a source of great excitement</P>
    <P>I discovered I knew <I>Tekhnologicheskii Institut</I> as well as <I>Ploshad
    Lenina</I></P>
    <P>Deductions are directions</P>
    <P>Truths change, things develop</P>
    <P>I felt a thrill of gratitude--to whom or wht it may refer</P>
    <P>Lurking with competence, I was familiar with the future....
