<FONT FACE="Times"> One of the cardinal principles-perhaps <U>the</U>
cardinal principle-of American Language poetics (as of the related
current in England usually labeled &quot;linguistically innovative
poetries&quot;) has been the dismissal of &quot;voice&quot; as
the foundational principle of lyric poetry.   In the preface (&quot;Language,
Realism, Poetry&quot;) to his anthology <U>In The American Tree</U>,
Ron Silliman famously declared that Robert Grenier's &quot;I HATE
SPEECH&quot; manifesto, published in the first issue of the San
Francisco journal <U>This</U> (1971),  &quot;announced a breach--and
a new moment in American writing&quot;--a rejection of &quot;simple
ego psychology in which the poetic text represents not a person,
but a persona, the human as unified object.  And the reader likewise.&quot;
   From the other coast, Charles Bernstein similarly denounced
&quot;voice&quot; as the &quot;privileged structure in the organization
and interpretation of poems.&quot;   And in his early essay &quot;Stray
Straws and Straw Men,&quot; Silliman is Bernstein's Exhibit A
for a constructivist poetry, a poetry that undermines the &quot;natural
look,&quot; with its &quot;personal subject matter &amp; a flowing
syntax&quot; (CD 41). &quot;Ron Silliman,&quot; Bernstein writes,
&quot;has consistently written a poetry of visible borders: a
poetry of shape&quot;--one that &quot;may discomfort those who
want a poetry primarily of personal communication, flowing freely
from the inside with the words of a natural rhythm of life, lived
daily&quot; (CD 41).   And the essay goes on to unmask &quot;Official
Verse Culture,&quot; with its  &quot;sanctification&quot; of &quot;authenticity,&quot;
&quot;artlessness,&quot; &quot;spontaneity,&quot; and claim for
<U>self-presence</U>, the notion, widely accepted in the poetry
of the 1960s, that &quot;The experience is present to me.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Although Bernstein doesn't explicitly say
so, the critique of &quot;voice,&quot; &quot;self-presence,&quot;
and authenticity, put forward in <U>Content's Dream</U>, as well
as in such related texts as Ron Silliman's own <U>The New Sentence</U>
(1987) or Steve McCaffery's <U>North of Intention</U> (1986),
must be understood as part of the larger post-structuralist critique
of authorship and the humanist subject, a critique that became
prominent in the late sixties and reached its height in the U.S.
a decade or so later when the Language movement was coming into
its own.  It was Roland Barthes, after all, who insisted, in &quot;The
Death of the Author&quot; (1968), that writing, far from being
the simple and direct expression of interiority, is &quot;the
destruction of every voice, every point of origin.  Writing is
that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips
away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with the
very identity of the body writing.&quot;  &quot;Linguistically,
&quot; Barthes declared, &quot;the author is never more than the
instance writing, just as <U>I</U> is nothing other than the instance
saying <U>I</U>: language knows a 'subject', not a 'person'.&quot;
 And he famously concludes:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">We know now that a text is not a line of words
releasing a single 'theological' meaning (the message of the Author-God).
. . . The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable
centres of culture.  The writer can only imitate a gesture that
is <U>always anterior, never original</U>.  His only power is
to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others. . .  . Succeeding
the Author, the scriptor no longer bears within him passions,
humours, feelings, impressions, but rather this immense dictionary
from which he draws a writing that can know no halt: life never
does more than imitate the book, and the book itself is only a
tissue of signs, an imitation that is lost, infinitely deferred.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Here Barthes anticipates Foucault's equally
famous pronouncement, in &quot;What is an Author?&quot; (1969),
that &quot;The writing of our day has freed itself from the necessity
of 'expression'.&quot;  In Foucault's words:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times"> Writing   unfolds like a game that inevitably
moves beyond its own rules and finally leaves them behind.   Thus,
the essential basis of this writing is not exalted emotions related
to the act of composition or the insertion of a subject into language.
 Rather, it is primarily concerned with creating an opening where
the writing subject endlessly disappears.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The author is now replaced by the &quot;author
function&quot;--the function of a particular discourse-- and the
pressing questions about a given text become, not &quot;What has
[the author] revealed of his most profound self in his language?&quot;,
but &quot;Where does [this discourse] come from; how is it circulated;
who controls it?&quot;   </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> What matter who's speaking?   Beckett's question,
as recharged and transmitted by Foucault, was to be historicized,
along Marxist, and specifically Althusserian lines, by Fredric
Jameson in <U>Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of late Capitalism</U>
(1991).   Whereas Barthes, Foucault, and the Derrida of <U>Writing
and Difference</U> were essentially talking about How To Read,
how, that is, to construct an existing text without taking its
author's intentions as normative, Jameson takes the Death of the
Author, or rather, the Death of the Subject, quite literally,
that death being no more than one of the symptoms of the social
transformations produced by late global capitalism.  &quot;The
very concept of expression,&quot; Jameson posits, &quot;presupposes
indeed some separation within the subject, and along with that
a whole metaphysics of the inside and outside&quot; that characterizes
great Modernist artworks like Van Gogh's  <U>Pair of</U> <U>Boots</U>
or Edward Munch's <U>The Cry</U>.  Postmodernism no longer recognizes
such &quot;depth models&quot; as inside/ outside, essence/appearance,
latent/manifest, authenticity/  inauthenticity, signifier/signified,
or depth/surface.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The &quot;alienation of the subject is displaced
by the latter's fragmentation,&quot; and indeed by the &quot;death&quot;
of the subject itself--the end of the autonomous bourgeois monad
or ego or individual.&quot;   Coupled with that end is the end
of a &quot;unique style, along with the accompanying collective
ideals of an artistic or political vanguard or avant-garde.&quot;
 The result is the now axiomatic &quot;waning of affect&quot;
that manifests itself in an ability to produce satire or even
parody, the latter giving way to &quot;blank parody&quot; or pastiche.
  &quot;As for expression,&quot; writes Jameson, &quot;. . . the
liberation, in contemporary society, from the older <U>anomie</U>
of the centered subject may also mean not merely a liberation
from anxiety but a liberation from every other kind of feeling
as well, since there is no longer a self present to do the feeling.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> In his first formulation of this &quot;new
depthlessness&quot; or &quot;waning of affect&quot; (1984), Jameson
voiced some regret over the passing of Modernism.   But by 1990
(the date of the &quot;Conclusion&quot; to <U>Postmodernism</U>),
he seems to find the passing of the Modernist Giants--Picasso,
Kafka, Proust, Frank Lloyd Wright--the occasion of at least some
satisfaction:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">[I]f  the poststructuralist motif of the 'death
of the subject' means anything socially, <U>it signals the end
of the entrepreneurial and inner-directed individualism, with
its &quot;charisma&quot; and its accompanying categorical panoply
of quaint romantic values such as that of the &quot;genius&quot;
in the first place</U>.   Seen thus, the extinction of the 'great
moderns' is not necessarily an occasion for pathos.  Our social
order is richer in information and more literate, and socially,
at least, more  &quot;democratic&quot; in the sense of the universalization
of wage labor . . . .this new order no longer needs prophets and
seers of the high modernist and charismatic type. . . . Such figures
no longer hold any charm or magic for the subjects of a corporate,
collectivized, post-individualistic age; in that case, goodbye
to them without regrets, as Brecht might have put it: <U>woe to
the country that needs geniuses, prophets, Great Writers, or demiurges</U>.
 (FJCG 306, my emphasis).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">I cite this passage at some length because
its argument has been so thoroughly internalized in our own &quot;advanced&quot;
discourses about the place of the aesthetic in our culture.  The
demise of the transcendental Ego, of the authentic self, of the
Poet as lonely Genius, of a unique artistic style: these, as we
have seen, are now taken as something of a given.    In their
group manifesto &quot;Aesthetic Tendency and the Politics of Poetry&quot;
(1988), for example, Ron Silliman, Carla Harryman, Lyn Hejinian,
Steve Benson, Bob Perelman, and Barrett Watten concur that &quot;our
work denies the centrality of the individual artist. . . . The
self as the central and final term of creative practice is being
challenged and exploded in our writing.&quot;    And, given the
tedious and unreflective claim for the unique insight and individual
vision that has characterized so large a portion of mainstream
poetry, the case for an &quot;alternative&quot; poetics remains
compelling.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> At the same time, now that the exploratory
poetries associated with the Language movement are more than twenty
years old, Jameson's formulations (and related theories of the
postmodern) have lost much of their edge.  For, even if we set
aside the work of mainstream poets like the American laureates
Robert Pinsky and Robert Hass, Mark Strand and Rita Dove, even
if we restrict ourselves to the poets of the counterculture represented
in, say, Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris's new <U>Poems for
the Millenium</U> (1998), differences between the various poets
now strike us as more significant than similarities or group labels.
  Such counters as &quot;asyntacticality&quot; or the &quot;disappearance
of the referent&quot; or even the &quot;materiality of the sign&quot;
cannot alter the simple fact that we can easily tell a Charles
Bernstein poem from one by Steve McCaffery, a Tom Raworth sequence
from one by Allen Fisher, a Maggie O'Sullivan &quot;verbovisivocal&quot;
text from one by Susan Howe.   More important: the breakdown of
the High/Low distinction, accepted as a cornerstone of postmodernism
by the theorists of the seventies and eighties, is coming under
increasing suspicion as common sense tells us that all artworks
are not, after all, equally &quot;valuable&quot;  (whatever &quot;valuable&quot;
means), and that when, for example, Frank Sinatra is called, as
he has been in the wake of his recent death, &quot;one of the
great artists of the century,&quot; this statement is not really
equivalent to the proposition that John Cage is one of the great
artists of the century.  For one thing, the two assertions call
for different speakers.  For another, they posit different contexts.
 The word &quot;great&quot; in any case, means something different
in the two cases, as does the word &quot;artist.&quot;  Even &quot;One
of&quot; is unstable: Sinatra fans were comparing their idol,
not only to other &quot;great&quot; singers and movie stars but
to tycoons of the American record industry, those savvy entrepreneurs
who know how to market a given label.  In the case of Cage, on
the other hand, &quot;one of&quot; would refer to the international
avant-garde market-- the H&ouml;rspiele heard on German radio
as well as the Zen art of Japan.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Then, too, contemporary poetics has not satisfactorily
resolved the relation of what Jameson calls the &quot;new depthlessness&quot;
to the &quot;genius&quot; position now occupied by those evidently
&quot;deep&quot; (read &quot;complex,&quot; &quot;difficult&quot;)
theorists, whose word  is all but law.  Indeed, even as Jameson
rejects the image of the &quot;great demiurges and prophets&quot;
like &quot;Proust in his cork-lined room&quot; or the &quot;'tragic,'
uniquely doomed Kafka&quot; (FJCL 205), he cites, on page after
page, names like Adorno and Althusser, Freud and Lacan, Hegel
and Nietzsche, Jean-Francois Lyotard and Ernesto Laclau, not to
mention the book's presiding deity who is, of course, Karl Marx.
 If genius theory is pass&eacute;, if there is no such thing as
unique style or authorial presence, why are these names so sacred?
 If Foucault has pronounced so definitively on the death of the
author, why are we always invoking the name of the author Foucault?
 Again, if in the current climate we dare not claim canonical
status for Samuel Beckett or Bertolt Brecht, why does Walter Benjamin
enjoy that status so readily?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> In a recent essay for Charles Bernstein's
collection <U>Close Listening</U>  (1998), Ron Silliman speculates
on this phenomenon.  Silliman begins by restating his opposition
to &quot;the poem as confession of lived personal experience,
the (mostly) free verse presentation of sincerity and authenticity
that for several decades has been a staple of most of the creative
writings in the United States.&quot;  But, in reevaluating what
he calls, Barthes's &quot;ritual slaying of the author&quot; (RSCL
364), Silliman  wonders whether Barthes's theory of text construction
hasn't gone too far. The insistence, in &quot;The Death of the
Author,&quot; that &quot;the reader is without history, biography,
psychology; he is simply that <U>someone</U> who holds together
in a single field all the traces by which the written text is
constituted,&quot; is finally unsatisfactory:  &quot;The idealized,
absent author of the New Critical canon has here been replaced
by an equally idealized, absent reader.  All that remains are
the reports of other readers--call them critics--whose texts endlessly
read textuality itself, whose claim to authority lies precisely
in the self-knowledge of their texts as infinitely deferred, deferring,
acts&quot; (RSCL 365).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> And where do these acts take place?  Where
else but in the university?  As Silliman speculates: </FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">Perhaps it should not be a surprise, that while
postmodernism in the arts has been conducted largely, although
not exclusively, outside of the academy, the postmodern debate
has been largely conducted between different schools of professors
who agree only that they too dislike it.   Thus the characteristic
strategy of the ambitious critic and anxious graduate student
alike is not the opening of the canons, but rather the demonstration
of a critical move upon some text(s) within the already established
ensemble of official canons. . .  . Once incorporated into an
institutional canon, the text becomes little more than a ventriloquist's
dummy through which a babel of critical voices contend.  (RSCL
365, 368).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Barthes could not, of course, have foreseen
that the privilege he accorded the reader (&quot;We know now that
a text is not a line of words releasing a single 'theological'
meaning&quot;) would so easily turn into the form of ventriloquism
Silliman describes.  But, as those of us in the academy know only
too well, this is precisely what has happened.  &quot;We know
now: (&quot;<U>On sait maintenant</U>&quot;): we who are critics
can practice our virtuosity on this or that poem which is consequently
accorded secondary status.  Hence the elevated status of Benjamin
or Deleuze vis-&agrave;-vis Beckett or Kafka.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> What matter who's speaking?   Perhaps it is
time to reconsider the role of the subject in lyric poetry. &quot;The
relation between agency and identity,&quot; writes Silliman, 
&quot;must be understood as interactive, fluid, negotiable&quot;
(RSCL 371).  It is a &quot;relation between the poet, a real person
with 'history, biography, psychology,' and the reader, no less
real, no less encumbered by all this baggage.  In poetry, the
self is a relation between writer and reader that is triggered
by what [Roman] Jakobson called contact, the power of presence&quot;
(RSCL 373).   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> I find it interesting that Silliman, once
an outspoken detractor of formalism, here invokes the name of
the great Russian Formalist critic. A similar shift may be noted
in the work of Charles Bernstein.  In the mordantly funny essay
&quot;The Revenge of the Poet-Critic&quot; (1998), Bernstein examines
the issues posed by the poetics of cultural construction.  &quot;In
the 1990s,&quot; he remarks, &quot;the problems of group affiliation
pose as much a problem for poetry as do neolyric assertions of
the individual Voice.  If poems can't speak directly for an author,
neither can they speak directly for a group. . . . Each poem speaks
not only many voices but also many groups and poetry can investigate
the construction of these <U>provisional </U>entities in and through
and by language.  If individual identity is a false front, group
identity is a false fort.&quot;  And in the related essay &quot;What's
Art Got to Do with It?  The Status of the Subject of the Humanities
in an Age of Cultural Studies,&quot; Bernstein gives a devastating
critique of the current critical orthodoxy which treats literature
as no more than &quot;symptom&quot; or &quot;example,&quot; even
as the theorist is taken to be above and beyond the fray.  Isn't
it possible, asks Bernstein, that Bourdieu's <U>Distinction: A
Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste</U> is itself a &quot;commodity
whose status is determined by its role in the professional habitat
to which he belongs?&quot;  Or again, &quot;Is Fredric Jameson's
writing on postmodernism a symptom of postindustrial capitalism?&quot;
 (MW 62-63).     &quot;Behind every successful artist,&quot; Bernstein
declares, &quot;is a new historian who says it's all just a symptom.
 Behind every successful new historian is an artist who says you
forgot to mention my work--and, boy, is it symptomatic!&quot;
(MW 67).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Of course, as Bernstein would be the first
to insist, there's no going back to earlier models.   The workshop
term <U>voice</U>, for example, a term that implies, quite inaccurately,
that <U>speech</U> is primary and prior to writing and that hence
a poem is simply the outward sign of a spoken self-presence (as
in the ubiquitous clich&eacute;, &quot;She's really found her
voice&quot;) is not adequate. Neither is the fuzzy term <U>style</U>,
a term now thoroughly co-opted by the media and commodified in
such titles as &quot;Life and Style&quot; (a daily section of
the <U>Los Angeles Times</U>).   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Perhaps a more accurate term to refer to the
mark of difference that separates one identity from another, no
matter how fully the two share a particular group aesthetic, is
the word <U>signature</U>.  In its original definition (1580),
from the Latin <U>signare</U>, <U>to sign or mark</U> (OED), a
<U>signature</U> is &quot;the name (or special mark) of a person
written with his or her own hand as an authentication of some
document or writing.&quot;  &quot;The fatal signature,&quot; we
read in Robert Southey's <U>All For Love</U> (1829), &quot;appear'd
/ To all the multitude, / Distinct as when the accursed pen /
Had traced it with fresh blood.&quot;  A subsidiary meaning of
<U>signature</U>, now obsolete (OED 4) was &quot;A distinctive
mark, a peculiarity in form or colouring, etc. on a plant or other
natural object, formerly supposed to be an indication of its qualities,
especially  for medicinal purposes&quot; (1613).  A signature
thus came to mean &quot;a distinguishing mark of any kind&quot;:
in 1626, Lancelot Andrewes wrote in one of his sermons, &quot;The
saviour . . . taking on Him &quot;Abraham's seed&quot; must withal
take on Him the signature of Abraham's seed, and be . . . circumcised.&quot;
And in his translation of the <U>Odyssey</U> (1725), Pope writes,
&quot;Vulgar parents cannot stamp their race / With signatures
of such majestic grace.&quot;  In the seventeenth century (this
meaning is now obsolete), <U>signature</U> was used to designate
a <U>naevus</U> or birth-mark (OED 5b).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> A second category of definitions comes from
the discourse of printing: a <U>signature</U>, let's recall, is
&quot;a letter or figure, a set of combination of letters or figures,
etc., placed by the printer at the foot of the first page (and
frequently on one or more of the succeeding pages) of every sheet
in a book, for the purpose of showing the order in which these
are to be placed or bound&quot; (OED 6).   And thirdly, there
is the musical designation of <U>signature</U>: from 1806 on (OED
7), it has meant &quot;A sign, or set of signs, placed at the
beginning of a piece of music, immediately after the clef, to
indicate its key or time.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The common thread of all three of the above
categories is that of the <U>signature</U> as identifying mark.
 As such, it is not surprising that, like its cognate term, <U>author</U>,
the word <U>signature</U> became suspect in poststructuralist
theory.  In <U>Les Mots et les choses</U> (1966), Foucault writes
movingly of <U>signatures</U> as the key element in the system
of similitudes that dominated the pre-Modern world.  As &quot;the
visible mark of invisible analogies,&quot; the signature was,
for centuries, the external sign of a hidden but present interiority,
and the world was &quot;read&quot; as a large open book, whose
signs, characters, numbers, symbols, and hieroglyphs demand interpretation.
 &quot;To find the law of signs,&quot; as Foucault famously puts
it &quot;is to discover things.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> <U>Les Mots et les choses</U> traces the historical
dissolution of this Renaissance &quot;episteme,&quot; a dissolution
considered from a hermeneutic perspective by Derrida in &quot;Signature
Event Context&quot; (1972).  &quot;A written sign . . . ,&quot;
writes Derrida, &quot;is a mark that subsists, one which does
not exhaust itself in the moment of its inscription and which
can give rise to an iteration in the absence and beyond the presence
of the empirically determined subject who, in a given context,
has emitted or produced it.&quot;  But since the written sign
inevitably breaks with its context, &quot;with the collectivity
of presences organizing the moment of inscription&quot; (SEC 9),
 &quot;the absolute singularity of signature as event&quot; (SEC
20) can never fully occur.  Thus writing &quot;is not the site,
'in the last instance,' of a hermeneutic deciphering, the decoding
of a meaning or truth&quot;(SEC 21).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> From a hermeneutic perspective, this is no
doubt the case.  But even Derrida, posing the question, &quot;Are
there signatures?&quot;,  responds, &quot;Yes, of course, every
day.  Effects of signature are the most common thing in the world&quot;
(SEC 20).  And he ends his essay with the &quot;counterfeit&quot;
signature &quot;J. Derrida&quot; (SEC 21).   The implication is
that, however conscious we must be of the basic instability of
a given signature, <U>in practice</U>, we do take signatures seriously
as markers of a particular individual, a cultural practice, an
historical period, a national formation, a convention, and so
on.  Indeed, if our purpose is to understand specific writing
practices, individual as well as generic, we can hardly avoid
noting their individual &quot;stamp&quot; or mark of authorship.
  The new Bilbao-Guggenheim Museum, for example, may bear witness
to any number of postmodern architectural traits (and some modernist
ones as well: witness the <U>c&ocirc;t&eacute; </U>Frank Lloyd
Wright of the building), but its indelible signature is that of
its highly individual architect Frank Gehry.   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">This brings me back to the question of the
lyric subject in the ostensibly &quot;de-authorized&quot; work
of the language poets.  In what follows, I want to look at signatures
in two poetic texts, both of them written by what are nominally
Language poets and both charting, in very specific ways, the geography
of childhood.  The first is Ron Silliman's own &quot;Albany,&quot;
the second, Susan Howe's &quot;Frame Structures.&quot;  <BR>

<FONT FACE="Times"> &quot;Albany&quot; is a long prose paragraph
made up of one hundred &quot;New Sentences,&quot; to use Ron Silliman's
own term, defined in a now well-known (and hotly debated) essay
by that name.  The &quot;new sentence&quot; is conceived as an
independent unit, neither causally nor temporally related to the
sentences that precede and follow it.    Like a line in poetry,
its length is operative, and its meaning depends on the larger
paragraph as organizing system.   Here, for example, are the first
twenty sentences of &quot;Albany&quot;:</FONT>

both written a few years earlier, &quot;Albany&quot; relies on
parataxis, dislocation, and ellipsis (the very first sentence,
for example, is a conditional clause, whose result clause is missing),
as well as pun, paragram, and sound play to construct its larger
paragraph unit.  But it is not just a matter of missing pieces.
 The poet also avoids conventional &quot;expressivity&quot; by
 refusing to present us with a consistent &quot;I,&quot; not specifying,
for that matter, who the subject of a given sentence might be.
 Who, for example, says &quot;I just want to make it to lunchtime&quot;?
 Or &quot;Talking so much is oppressive&quot;?  Who believes that
&quot;Music is essential,&quot; and, by the way, essential to
what?  Whose &quot;carelessness has led to abortion&quot;?  Whose
&quot;best friend was Hispanic&quot;?  And so on.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> At the same time--and this has always been
a Silliman trademark--indeterminacy of agent and referent does
not preclude an obsessive attention to particular &quot;realistic&quot;
detail.   Despite repeated time and space shifts, the world of
Albany, CA. is wholly recognizable.   It is, to begin with, not
the Bay Area of the affluent-- the Marin County suburbanites,
Russian Hill aesthetes, or Berkeley middle-class go-getters. 
The working-class motif is immediately established with the reference
to &quot;My father withheld child support, forcing my mother to
live with her parents, my brother and I to be raised together
in a small room.&quot;  And this is the white working class: &quot;Grandfather
called them niggers.&quot;  Later, when the narrator is living
in a part of San Francisco where, on the contrary, many ethnicities
are represented, we read that &quot;They speak in Farsi at the
corner store.&quot;  The poet is a political activist: he participates
in demonstrations and teach-ins, is briefly jailed, avoids the
draft, and so on.  There are many explanations of everyday things
the activist must deal with: &quot;The cops wear shields that
serve as masks.&quot;   But the paragraph is also filled with
references to sexual love: couplings and uncouplings, rape, miscarriage,
and abortion.  And finally, there is the motif of poetry:  &quot;If
it demonstrates form they can't read it.&quot;  And readings:
&quot;It's not easy if your audience doesn't identify as readers.&quot;
 Writing poetry is always a subtext but one makes one's living
elsewhere: &quot;The want-ads,&quot; as the last sentence reminds
us, &quot;lie strewn on the table.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> &quot;Silliman's work,&quot; observes Jed
Rasula, &quot;may be read as a grand refusal of the chronic strategies
of authorial domination.&quot;  Here Rasula echoes Silliman's
own early Language manifestos, with their emphasis on the avoidance
of what Charles Olson called the &quot;lyrical interference of
the individual as ego,&quot; the refusal to create a consistent
or controlling &quot;self,&quot; whose construction of events
as of verbal forms controls the material in question.  The &quot;realism&quot;
of &quot;Albany,&quot; Rasula would no doubt argue, is properly
understood, not as personal expression, but as elaborate network
of signifiers in which conflicting vocalizations and linguistic
registers come into play.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> But must it be either/or?   And is it really
the case that Silliman eschews &quot;authorial domination&quot;?
  I find myself increasingly uncomfortable with such formulations.
  For who, after all, controls the specific language operations
in the text before us?   There is, to begin with, not the slightest
doubt that Albany is a man's poem: a man, aware of the sexual
needs and difficulties of the women in his life, but centrally
caught up in the political: the need for demonstrations, the abuses
of the cops, the &quot;bayonets on campus,&quot; the question
of &quot;nationalist movements in the Third World.&quot;  &quot;How
concerned was I,&quot; we read in sentence 11, &quot;over her
failure to have orgasms.&quot;  Evidently not overly concerned,
since the very next sentence reads &quot;Mondale's speech was
drowned by jeers.&quot;  Even such seemingly neutral statements
as &quot;My turn to cook&quot; give <U>Albany</U> away as a man's
poem: woman's &quot;turn to cook,&quot; let's remember, is not
an item of interest for most women since it's always our turn
to cook.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The signature of <U>Albany</U> is a &quot;normal&quot;
declarative sentence (&quot;I can't afford an automobile&quot;),
or part of a sentence (&quot;&quot;To own a basement,&quot; &quot;Died
in action&quot;), sometimes commonsensical, sometimes aphoristic,
 sometimes an item in a newspaper or on television.  In their
curious collisions, these &quot;casual&quot; sentences point to
an author who is matter-of-fact, street-wise, and largely self-educated;
 his is the discourse of a working-class man (as even the first
name Ron rather than Ronald suggests) who has slowly and painfully
learned the craft of poetry, a man who's been around and has had
to put up with quite a bit, beginning with his father's withholding
of child support.  Pain, violence and injustice are the facts
of his life: sentence after sentence refers to murders, shoot-outs,
abortions, riots, asbestos poisoning and the like.  And even at
the trivial level, difficulty dominates:  &quot;It was hard to
adjust my sleeping to those hours when the sun was up.&quot; 
&quot;Becoming to live with less space.&quot;  &quot;I used my
grant to fix my teeth.&quot;  And so on.  Yet Silliman's characteristic
formulations are by no means gloomy:  on the contrary, his &quot;voice&quot;
emerges as sprightly, engaged, curious, fun-loving, energetic,
a voice that loves the word-play of  &quot;They call their clubs
batons.  They call their committees clubs.&quot;  Or &quot;Eminent
domain.  Rotating chair.&quot;   Or &quot;There were bayonets
on campus, cows in India, people shoplifting books.  I just wanted
to make it to lunch time.&quot;</FONT>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">All three of these passages come from poetic
works by San Francisco poets associated with the Language movement:
they are, respectively, Leslie Scalapino's &quot;hmmmm&quot; from
<U>Considering how exaggerated music is</U>, Michael Palmer's
&quot;Autobiography&quot; in <U>At Passages</U>, and Barrett Watten's
&quot;City Fields&quot; in <U>Frame</U> <U>(1971-1990</U>).  
 All three poets would insist, I think, that theirs is not an
&quot;expressivist&quot; poetry, that, in Palmer's words, &quot;He
regards the self as just another sign.&quot;  And it is true that,
read against, say, a lyric by Mark Strand or Louise Gluck, there
is no doubt that Scalapino, Palmer, and Watten are trying, in
the words of Jasper Johns, to &quot;do something else&quot; with
language, true that they have no interest in the closural first-person
metaphoric model of mainstream poetry.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> But to group these texts as &quot;Language
poems&quot; tells us very little.   Scalapino's nine-line paragraph
has a perfectly consistent angle of vision, quite unlike Silliman's
collage-prose.  It is part of a longer sequence on the uncanny
and terrifying substrate of ordinary life. Scalapino's empiricist
&quot;flat&quot; narrative purports merely to describe what happened,
but what did?  The scene, as so often in Silliman, is on a bus:
the poet is sitting next to an unknown woman.  When the bus lurches,
this woman, evidently to keep her balance, grabs the poet's arm
and pinches it.  The incident couldn't be more trivial but the
narrator is convinced that the woman is pinching her on purpose,
that somehow she is telling herself, <U>I wish that I could make
you yelp just once.</U>  There is no evidence for this malice,
but no evidence against it either: we only know that the woman's
&quot;lips were parted slightly, with her snout breathing softly,&quot;
the word &quot;snout&quot; for &quot;mouth&quot; connoting a malignant,
animal quality.  But of course the real focus of this paragraph
is not on the stranger but on the &quot;I,&quot; who reads these
sinister motives into the most ordinary of incidents.  Somehow--how?--her
mind's not right, or is it that her suspicion is merely the emblem
of the larger, depersonalized, tooth-and-claw survival of the
fittest that characterizes the postmodern metropolis?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Scalapino's prose, in any case, far from being
disjointed like Silliman's, moves seamlessly from beginning to
end, from the question &quot;How was I to know...&quot; to the
projected words of the stranger presented in italics.   Silliman
would never describe a woman as having a snout; indeed, his eyes
would barely take in her person and quickly, impatiently, move
on to something else--a memory, perhaps, of what <U>he</U> did
with <U>her</U>, or a description of a boarding house, or an amusing
pun that occurs to him.   His jaunty utterances, upbeat despite
the constant difficulties he faces, are quite unlike the just
barely controlled hysteria of &quot;Hmmm.&quot;  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Michael Palmer's lineated poem is called &quot;Autobiography&quot;
but the poet's tone is more impersonal than either Silliman's
or Scalapino's.    His short sentences, separated by large areas
of white space, are enigmatic and parabolic, his images equivocal.
 Some of his aphorisms--&quot;<U>A</U> and <U>not-A</U>--are the
same&quot;; &quot;The world is all that is displaced&quot;--allude
to Wittgenstein, the latter a nice twist on &quot;The world is
everything that is the case&quot; (1.1. of the <U>Tractatus)</U>.
  Some sentences contain literary allusions:  &quot;My dog does
not know me,&quot; for example, inverts Gertrude Stein's, &quot;I
am I because my little dog knows me.&quot;   In this context,
&quot;My dog does not know me&quot; is equivalent to saying &quot;I
am nothing.&quot;  &quot;All clocks are clouds&quot; brings to
mind a Magritte painting; and such lines as &quot;Winter roses
are invisible,&quot; and &quot;Late ice sometimes sings,&quot;
are written under the sign of Andr&eacute; Breton's <U>Nadja<I>
</I></U>and related Surrealist dreamworks.   Unlike either Silliman
or Scalapino, both of them insistently urban poets, Palmer is
given to references to &quot;roses&quot; and &quot;ice,&quot;
to &quot;the crescent beach, a drowned deer.&quot;   And these
nature images are underscored by references to foreign (usually
European) locales, as in &quot;Apples in a stall at the streetcorner
by the Bahnhof, pale yellow to blackish red&quot;).    One thinks
here of Apollinaire 's &quot;Zone&quot; or Cendrars's &quot;Panama,
or My Seven Uncles.&quot;  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Altogether, Palmer's imagination is more visual
and literary than Silliman's; his memories more hallucinatory
and dreamlike.  His is the anxiety, not of the malignant, faceless
crowd, as in Scalapino's piece, but of the empty room: &quot;Violins,
like dreams, are suspect.&quot;  &quot;There is,&quot; David Levi
Strauss has remarked, &quot;a quite identifiable first person
running through [Palmer's] books.  It is usually male, neurasthenic,
doubtful, by turns cheerful and morose: a reluctant survivor.
 If it had a visible companion, the other might be called Didi
or Clov or Camier.  This first person is trepidatious and apologetic,
constantly undercutting its own authority.&quot;   In &quot;Autobiography,&quot;
not surprisingly, Silliman's sturdy resilience gives way to &quot;Shortness
of breath, accompanied by tinnitus.&quot;  And although, like
Silliman, Palmer writes a poetry of parataxis, his is a juxtapositioning
of poetic and , philosophical fragments rather than the phenomenology
of everyday life characteristic of Silliman.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Yet another kind of psychic drive can be found
in Barrett Watten's prose poem, again part of a longer sequence.
 Unlike Silliman, Scalapino, and Palmer, Watten uses the third
person, but his narrator, who becomes &quot;a lens on a room inside,&quot;
functions as a kind of Jamesian register, through whom all &quot;events&quot;
and items perceived are filtered.  It is he who is &quot;in possession
of what he sees,&quot; first from outside the room and then from
inside.  He who feels cut off from the &quot;fragments of their
talk&quot;.   Yet he is more confident than Palmer's self-critical
&quot;I,&quot; more assertive about &quot;imagining a better place
to live.&quot;  Anxiety, for Watten, is socially constructed and
hence to be overcome by social change: &quot;All words resolve
this matter like a huge weight balancing on a single point.&quot;
  For the moment, however, there is no escape: &quot;A cyclone
covers the surface of the ceiling with wavering lines.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> In Watten's account of displacement and possible
reconnection, each sentence leads to the next.  If Silliman were
writing this, &quot;The window is off the kitchen,&quot; would
be followed by a sentence like &quot;Net income is down 13%&quot;
or &quot;They photograph Habermas to hide the hairlip.&quot; 
Watten's prose is more chaste, consecutive, linear; his vocabulary
less exuberant and varied.  And even though his narrator never
speaks in his own person, a voice--measured yet urgent, direct
yet highly &quot;educated&quot;--comes through.  Again, no one
would mistake this passage for a work by Silliman.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The poet's &quot;naevus&quot; or &quot;birthmark,&quot;
it would seem, is not so easily eradicated.  It is interesting
that when, in 1997, Gale Research invited Silliman to contribute
an autobiographical essay to their <U>Contemporary Authors</U>
series, he used, as he explains in a letter (10 January 1998)
to me, the sentences of &quot;Albany&quot; &quot;to tell me what
to write, where to focus, that moment in the essay.  The whole
premise of 'Albany' (or at least <U>a</U> premise) was to focus
on things that were both personal and political, so when Gale
called, it seemed like the right place to begin.  <U>That poem
always has been my autobiography, so to speak</U>&quot; (my emphasis).
 The resultant text, in which each of the one hundred sentences
is printed in boldface, followed by a paragraph of varying length,
 is called <U>Under Albany</U>-&quot;under,&quot; no doubt, because
the poet now tries to get inside, behind, and <U>under</U> his
earlier statements so as to make some sense of their psychological
and social trajectory.   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Not infrequently, the &quot;under&quot; entry
contradicts or qualifies the original sentence.   For example
(sentence 3):</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT FACE="Times">Grandfather called them niggers</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">So that I was surprised at how many elderly
African American men, all, like my grandfather, members of the
Veterans for Foreign Wars (VFW) came to his funeral.  (3)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">In the context of &quot;Albany,&quot; the first
sentence is taken at face value.  Followed as it is in the original
poem by &quot;I can't afford an automobile,&quot; it gives us
a sense of the bleak deprivation and petty racism of white working
class Albany, CA.  But in <U>Under Albany</U>, the meaning of
what is now a title shifts: perhaps, the reader here surmises,
&quot;calling them niggers&quot; wasn't equivalent to simple racism,
for, as Veterans of World War I, black and white men may well
have had interacted more fully than have their grandsons.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">I have discussed elsewhere the complex relationship
of title to paragraph in <U>Under Albany</U>, a text that is deeply
moving in its account of the poet's empty childhood-a childhood
that paradoxically paves the way for the remarkable resilience
and optimism of Silliman's maturity: </FONT>

never crossed, just as mine never crossed Gertrude Stein's.  But
I know people who have slept with people who have slept with people
who slept with Walt Whitman.  At 94, Carl Rakosi's mind clear

walking on the beach at Stinson with Rae Armantrout during our

<FONT FACE="Times">In the context of Silliman's account of his
day-to-day difficulties and trauma, the upbeat ending of this

autobiography, but then &quot;Albany,&quot; the prior text that
supposedly exhibits what Jameson calls the &quot;waning of affect,&quot;
was always already autobiographical.<BR>

surveyor's (William Byrd's) mark made in delineating a boundary

also a trace, a sign that points us to specific things that have
happened: one thinks of Blake's &quot;London,&quot; with its lines,
&quot;And mark in every face I meet / Marks of weakness, marks
of woe.&quot;   The poem's opening &quot;Mark   mar   ha   forest

a number of paragrammatic possibilities.   <U>Mark   ma    ha</U>:

missing in the imagined source manuscript  Here and throughout
the text, &quot;boundary manic&quot; is central to the poet's
thought; she is mesmerized by questions of &quot;secret&quot;
divisions, borders, boundaries, fault lines.  Then, too, &quot;Mark&quot;

visual poetry, and the founding and early history of Buffalo.
 For example:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times"> I was never sure what my father was doing
in the army.  Then I was never sure</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">of anything what with his rushing away or changing
cities and World War banging at windows the boundless phenomena
of madness.  I remember him coming back to Buffalo from basic
training by snapshot once or twice in a uniform.  Absence is always
present in a picture in its right relations.  There is a split
then how to act.  Laws are relations among individuals.<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> When Theophile Cazenove reached America in
1789, he realized that Philadelphia was the best scene for his
operations because the future of American funds, federal and state,
depended on the actions of the federal government.  Pavements
were in wider space and getting social satisfaction he carried
along a letter of introduction from his backers in Amsterdam to
Andrew Craigie in New York.  The Van Staphorts told Craigie their
envoy came to America &quot;to gratify his thirst after knowledge
in order to become better acquainted with the Genius of their
Government and the objects of their growing commerce.&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times">The common wisdom would be that these two paragraphs
are &quot;straight&quot;-although rather odd--prose: in the first
sentence above, for example, the noun phrase &quot;the boundless
phenomena of madness&quot; is syntactically but not semantically
in apposition to the noun &quot;windows.&quot;   And the relation
of syntax to semantics gets stranger as the paragraph continues:
how, for example, can the poet's father be &quot;coming back from
basic training by snapshot&quot;?  Similar non-sequiturs characterize
the passage about Cazenove, as when  &quot;pavements . . . in
wider space&quot; are linked to &quot;social satisfaction.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> How to construe this curious way of writing
an autobiographical memoir, a memoir designed to serve as &quot;frame
structure&quot; for the disjointed and fragmentary lyric poems
that follow?  In one sense, &quot;Frame Structures&quot; recalls
Robert Lowell's &quot;91 Revere Street,&quot; that bemused account
of the Beacon Hill childhood and &quot;Mayflower screwball&quot;
ancestry that makes &quot;young Bob&quot; the neurotic and specially
gifted child he is.  But whereas &quot;91 Revere Street,&quot;
provides us with a series of snapshots, in which the Winslow-Lowell
relatives come before us in all their foibles and futility, &quot;Frame
Structures&quot; juxtaposes biographical sketches (for example,
the poet's American grandfather, Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe [1864-1960])
with the documentary history of the founding of Buffalo, with
allusions to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's <U>Evangeline</U> and
James Joyce's <U>Eveline</U> as analogues to the family and social
drama of the Howes and Quincys, and with scraps (&quot;flinders&quot;)
of largely illegible text, evidently drawn from Edward Gibbon.
  Again, whereas &quot;91 Revere Street&quot; is a kind of mirror
image (in prose) of the autobiographical poems like &quot;Commander
Lowell&quot; and &quot;Beverly Farms&quot; that comprise  <U>Life
Studies</U>, poems that culminate in Lowell's own very private
&quot;Skunk Hour,&quot; in the case of <U>Frame Structures</U>,
the connection between Howe's memoir and, say, the epigraphs from
Boswell's <U>Life of Johnson</U> and Beatrix Potter's <U>Peter
Rabbit</U> that open <U>Cabbage Gardens</U> (see FS 74), remains
elusive.  Indeed, the oblique narrative that follows, which begins
with the lines</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">seem to have no identifiable lyric subject.
 Here, Howe's detractors would say, is a cryptic language poem
that denies the very possibilities of the expressivity one wants
from lyric.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Or does it?  Consider the leitmotif of framing
and being framed that runs through both prose preface and visual
poems, crisscrossing, in a myriad ways, the related motifs of
war and colonization.   The frontispiece (figure 2) is an engraving
from Frank Severance's <U>Picture Book of Earlier Buffalo</U>,
based on &quot;an original sketch by Lt. Jesse D. Elliott, accompanying
his report to the Secretary of the Navy on the Capture of the
Detroit and Caledonia, dated Black Rock Oct. 9, 1812.&quot;  &quot;The
Second Oldest View of Buffalo,&quot; as this depiction of schooners
going up in smoke is captioned in Howe's book, thus immediately
introduces the motif of war, in this case the War of 1812.   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> But if this is the &quot;Second Oldest View
of Buffalo,&quot;  what would the first look like?   For Howe,
origins cannot be known.  &quot;Lines represent the limits of
bodies encompassed by the eye&quot; (FS 5).  The section &quot;<U>Floating
loans</U>&quot; contains an historical sketch of Joseph Ellicott's
acquisition and settling of the land in upstate New York that
was to be called Buffalo.  We can take in the facts but we cannot
quite visualize the resulting city.  &quot;Space is a frame we
map ourselves in&quot; (FS 9).  When we finally do &quot;see&quot;
the Buffalo harbor in the engraving, we are witnessing a war scene:
 war, for that matter, is very much this poem's condition.   At
the same time, &quot;a picture,&quot; as Wittgenstein puts it,
 &quot;held us captive&quot;: neither poet nor reader can get
beyond the engraving, stylized image, to experience the &quot;reality&quot;
of Buffalo. This is why names become so tantalizing:  Nicholas
Van Staphorst, Christiaan Van Eeghen, Paul Busti: we yearn for,
but cannot get at, what's behind them.   And consider the absurdity
of calling a city Buffalo.  &quot;Clans and individuals adopt
the name of animals,&quot; Howe remarks, &quot;cities seldom do.&quot;
  And she adds, &quot;Prefaces are usually afterimages.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">  The first sentence of Howe's &quot;afterimage,&quot;
under the heading <U>Flanders</U>, with its allusion to World
War I, is, &quot;On Sunday, December 7, 1941, I went with my father
to the zoo in Delaware Park even now so many years after there
is always for me the fact of this treasured memory of togetherness
before he enlisted in the army and went away to Europe&quot; (FS
3).  December 7, 1941 is, of course, Pearl Harbor Day, but this
fact is not mentioned, the focus being on the &quot;usually docile
polar bears rov[ing] restlessly back and forth around the simulated
rocks caves and waterfall designed to keep brute force fenced
off even by menace of embrace so many zoo animals are accounted
fierce&quot; (FS 3). The final clause here trails off, &quot;so
many&quot; not anticipated by what comes before.  The three polar
bears are framed both literally and figuratively--literally behind
the &quot;iron railing&quot; of their cage, figuratively by &quot;the
north wind of the fairy story [&quot;Goldilocks&quot;] &quot;ringing
in my ears as well as direct perception&quot; (FS 3).   From the
opening image of (unstated) war malaise, through the accounts
of King Philip's War, the Revolutionary War, World War I, and
World War II, the text's war space is crisscrossed by &quot;life-lines,&quot;
 lines of descent, connection, and association that, as the poet
puts it, &quot;I transmit to you from the point of impact throughout
every snowing difficulty,&quot; lines &quot;certified by surveyors
chain-bearers artists and authors walking the world keeping Field
Notes&quot; (FS 28).   From Flanders to <U>Flinders</U>, from
Nigeria, to Niger, to Niagara, from the &quot;iron railings&quot;
of the bear compound in the zoo to the &quot;iron railings&quot;
of the Charles Street Jail, from Fanny Appleton Longfellow to
the poet's younger sister Fanny.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> But the lines are also borders, boundaries,
marks of enclosure--the line between the Boston Brahmin Howes
and Quincys on the one hand and the Irish Mannings on the other.
 The Preface thus paves the way for the poems that follow:   &quot;<U>Hinge</U>
Picture,&quot; &quot;Western <U>Borders</U>,&quot; &quot;Secret
History of the <U>Dividing Line</U>&quot;  (my italics).  And
even in &quot;Cabbage Gardens,&quot; the shifts in line justification
and word placement (see figure 3), suggests that language is always
in danger of becoming an enclosed space but that the poet refuses
to let forms play their accepted role.  Each segment is, so to
speak, a &quot;cabbage garden&quot; that is planted differently.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The extensive historical documentation in
&quot;Frame Structures&quot; thus serves to construct the past
which has shaped what Howe takes to be her very palpable present.
 Weetamoo, &quot;squaw-sachem of the Wampanoags, Queen of Pocasset
(now Tiverton), wife of Wamsutta the son of Massasoit and sister-in-law
of the Narrangansett sachem, Metacomet (King Philip to the colonial
militia),&quot; a figure Howe knows only from her reading of Mary
Rowlandson, is just as &quot;real&quot; as John d&quot;Wolf, &quot;Norwest
John,&quot; a venture capitalist who &quot;sailed to Russia by
way of Alaska&quot; (FS 21).  The poet herself appears only in
the interstices of the text:  &quot;Now draw a trajectory in imagination
where logic and mathematics meet the materials of art.  Canvas,
paper, pencil, color, frame, title. . . &quot; (FS 27).  Right
after this catalogue of artist's tools (where &quot;title&quot;
is the odd item)  the cited overprint text becomes illegible (see
figure 4), forcing the reader to become a kind of viewer / voyeur.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The Preface never spells out its &quot;life-lines&quot;
to the lyrics that follow.   In the words of the epigraph from
Duchamp's <U>Green Box</U> that opens <U>Hinge Picture</U> (FS
32)--&quot;Perhaps make a HINGE PICTURE.  (folding yardstick,
book. . . .) / develops in space the PRINCIPLE OF THE HINGE in
the displacements 1st in the plane 2d in space&quot;--the Preface
 is a kind of &quot;Hinge Picture,&quot; that contains connections
to the historical and literary fragments that follow.  Indeed,
Howe's book is an elaborate trace structure:  <U>Secret History
of the Dividing Line</U> ends with a verbal rectangle on an otherwise
empty white field (FS 122):</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Compared to the &quot;Robert Lowell&quot;
of <U>Life Studies</U>, Howe's  &quot;I&quot;- female, maverick,
only half New England blueblood- is much less of an insider, much
more self-conscious about her particular origins.  Her Boston
is always shadowed by her Buffalo.   Accordingly, she rarely speaks
in her own person (e.g., &quot;I was a deep and nervous child,&quot;
FS 3), preferring the voice of the chronicler (&quot;Joseph Ellicott,
sometimes called &quot;the father of Buffalo,&quot; was born in
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in 1760 to Quaker parents from England,&quot;
FS 5), and the voices of others:  </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Add to such voices the visual devices-- line
placement, typography, page design-that characterize all four
of the early books reprinted in <U>Frame Structures,</U> as well
as the new preface,  and you have a signature (quite literally,
a series of marks made on paper) as unique and &quot;personal&quot;
as any we have in poetry today.  Susan Howe and Ron Silliman,
included as they both are in every anthology of &quot;Language
poetry&quot; to date, could hardly be more different in their
modes of self-writing. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">What then of the purported &quot;death&quot;
of the subject? &quot;The revolution of the word,&quot; Silliman
remarks in a recent interview, &quot;is not an anarchist event.&quot;
 On the contrary, &quot;as the author, <U>I get to determine unilaterally
which words in what order will set forth the terms through which
the experience shall occur</U>.&quot;  A remarkable statement,
this, for a language poet, and yet, at one level, it is simple
common sense: every poet, after all, gets to determine the words
in his or her poem.  The question remains, of course, what larger
cultural and ideological constraints determine that determination.
 If Silliman and Howe's poetry is, as I have argued, a complex
amalgam of Language poetics and <U>difference</U>, a writing that
is everywhere resisting its paradigm, how, to turn over the half-full
cup and see it as half-empty, does that paradigm itself resist
its contemporary others?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Suppose we read the poems of Silliman and
Howe (or Palmer or Scalapino or Watten cited above), not against
one another but against those of a very different poetic community-for
example, the work of Charles Wright.  Here is one of the thirteen-line
lyrics (there are twenty-four, divided into three sections) in
Wright's  recent sequence &quot;Disjecta Membra,&quot; included
in James Tate's <U>Best American Poetry 1997</U>:</FONT>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The obvious thing would be to say that Wright's
lyric sequence, which traces the poet's emptying out, his night
and death thoughts, and the gradual renewal of being, as defined
by the seasonal cycle from the end of summer to the end of winter
in Virginia,  is more &quot;personal&quot; or &quot;expressive&quot;
than the &quot;language poems&quot; of Silliman or Howe.  But,
strictly speaking, we learn less about the particulars of Wright's
personal life than we do about theirs; people and places from
the poet's past and present remain elusive as do the causes that
trigger the feeling of absence and emptiness described so lovingly
in this particular snow poem, where even &quot;the almost full
moon / is under a monochrome counterpane / of dry grey.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> What <U>is</U> different is not expressivity
or subjectivity as such but the <U>authority </U>ascribed to the
speaking voice-and here it is a particular voice that is represented.
 Wright's speaker confidently uses metaphor to characterize what
he perceives ( &quot;The backyard's a winding sheet&quot;) and
feels (&quot;Epiphany two days gone&quot;); he compares the dismal
sleety night to that of Keats's <U>Eve of St. Agnes</U>, and knows
that what he sees when he looks out the window are &quot;nothing
. . .but broncos, pick-ups and 4 x 4s.&quot;  In &quot;Albany,&quot;
on the other hand, such connections and continuities (Wright's
winter portrait is wholly consistent and of a piece) are implictly
judged to be impossible.  Phrases like &quot;The bird demonstrates
the sky&quot; or &quot;Eminent domain&quot; cannot be taken as
self-revelatory.   For these utterances, in Silliman's scheme
of things, are not those of an observer located in a particular
place; indeed, the distinction between inside and outside has
been eroded.   For Silliman, as for Howe, there are no ideas or
facts outside the language that names them--no &quot;broncos,
pick-ups and 4 x 4s,&quot; no &quot;twenty-three inches&quot;
of snow, outside the poet's verbal as well as literal window.
 Rather-and here the difference in epistemology is profound-language
constructs the &quot;reality&quot; perceived.  And this means
that perspective, as in the polar-bear scene in Howe's &quot;Frame
Structures,&quot; is always shifting and that the subject, far
from being at the center of the discourse, as is the case in Wright's
poem, is located only at its interstices.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> It is not coincidental that &quot;Disjecta
Membra&quot; has echoes of Keats (and later, Stevens), for its
mode is Emersonian: &quot;We live in the wind-chill, / The what-if-and
what-was-not, / The blown and sour dust of just after or just
before, / The metaquotidian landscape / of soft edge and abyss&quot;
(p. 194).  Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.  There
is no way Ron Silliman or Susan Howe could write such a poem because
theirs is not a Romantic <U>Einf&uuml;hlung</U> into the external-is
there an external?-world.  And in this respect, we can differentiate
quite readily between their ethos and that of such mainstream
post-Romantic poets as Charles Wright or Mark Strand or Louise
Gluck. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> It was, of course, the opposition to this
Romantic paradigm that prompted the theoretical discourse of Language
manifestos in the first place.  And that oppositionality remains
significant even though the &quot;Us-versus-Them&quot; rhetoric
of <U>The L=A=N =G=U=A=G=E</U> <U>Book</U>, now twenty years old,
has become complicated by the appearance of new poetic paradigms
that don't quite fit the original theoretical frame.   The dialectic,
in other words,  has shifted ground and it now seems more useful
to look at special cases <U>within</U> the Language movement and
related alternate poetries rather than at the group phenomenon.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Indeed, the paradox is that, like the earlier
avant-garde movements of the century, Language poetics may well
become most widely known, when it starts to manifest notable exceptions.
 Imagism, after all,  became interesting only when Ezra Pound
declared that it had been diluted as &quot;Amygism&quot; and called
himself a Vorticist instead.  Dada, as I have suggested elsewhere,
derives much of its cultural capital from Duchamp, who had made
his most &quot;Dada&quot; <U>readymades</U> before he had ever
heard of the Cabaret Voltaire and who refused all his life to
participate in Dada exhibitions.  A renewal of interest in Concrete
Poetry was sparked by the decision of one Concrete poet, Ian Hamilton
Finlay, to cultivate (quite literally) his own &quot;concrete&quot;
Scottish garden.   And the New York School, felt by many to have
lost its center when Frank O'Hara died in 1966, is now getting
renewed mileage from the increasing renown of one of its charter
members, John Ashbery, even though Ashbery's poetry may well have
more in common with T. S. Eliot's than with Kenneth Koch's.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> I do not mean to downplay the role of community,
movement, cultural formation, or discourse in the making of avant-garde
aesthetic.  Community, after all, is crucial to the poets and
artists who belong to it, especially in their formative stages.
  Indeed, the prominence of the lonely isolated genius, which
Jameson takes to be the hallmark of modernism (as opposed to postmodernism),
was always something of a myth:  even those &quot;isolated geniuses&quot;
Joyce and Beckett needed a community of fellow-writers and a set
of publishing venues-for example, Eugene Jolas's <U>transition</U>--
within which to circulate.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">The poet has no obligation to be a responsible
historian; indeed, the anxiety of influence precludes the possibility
of reliable accounts of one's own genealogy.   Here is where the
poet's readers come in.  In writing as critics or literary historians,
even those who are themselves poets must maintain some critical
distance, discriminating, for example, between the &quot;language&quot;
poetics of Michael Palmer, with its Celanian and French Surrealist
cast, the New York school-based language poetics of Ron Silliman
and Bob Perelman, and the fusion of &quot;nation language&quot;
and &quot;video style&quot; in the work of a proto-language poet
like Kamau Brathwaite. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Movement ethos, itself the stepchild of the
post-structuralist critique of authorship, has, for too long now,
occluded the critical need to discriminate <U>difference</U>,
to define the signature  of the individual lyric subject in its
complex negotiations with its larger cultural and historical field
of operation.  In the words of Charles Bernstein's satiric little
poem (MW 3-4) on the limits of structuralism, &quot;Don't Be So
Sure (&quot;Don't Be Saussure)&quot;:</FONT>

Hejinian (1986): 33-45. &quot;The ideal of subjectivity itself,&quot;
writes Davidson, &quot;. . . is not so much the source as the
product of specific sociohistorical structures. The subject upon
which the lyric impulse is based, rather than being able to generate
its own language of the heart, is also constituted within a world
of public discourse. The lyric &quot;I&quot; emerges as a positional
relation. Its subjectivity is made possible by a linguistic and
ultimately social structure in which 'I' speaks&quot; (p. 41).

the Romantic notion that &quot;the poem is an epiphany inside
the poet's mind and then 'expressed' by choosing the right words.&quot;
Rather, &quot;The poem is not 'expression,' but a cognitive process
that, to some extent, changes me&quot; (pp. 609-610).<BR>

9. Fredric Jameson, &quot;The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism,&quot;
<U>Postmodernism Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</U>
(Durham: Duke University Press, 1991), pp. 11-15. Subsequently
cited in the text as FJCL. Later in the essay, Jameson cites Bob
Perelman's &quot;China&quot; as an instance of the &quot;schizophrenia&quot;
or &quot;breakdown in the signifying chain&quot; that characterizes
postmodernism. For Perelman's own response to this reading, see
his <U>The Marginalization of Poetry</U> (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1996), pp. 63-69. Subsequently cited in the
text as BPM. But for us the issue is less whether Jameson does
or does not give an adequate reading of &quot;China,&quot; but
whether the characterization of postmodernism holds up.<BR>

21. <U>Under Albany</U> is forthcoming from Gale Research, <U>Contemporary
Authors</U>, Vol. 29. Since it is not yet published, references
here are to the manuscript. It would be interesting to compare
Silliman's to a number of other language poets' autobiographical
memoirs written for the Gale series, especially Charles Bernstein's
&quot;An Autobiographical Interview Conducted by Loss Peque&ntilde;o
Glazier,&quot; <U>Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series</U>
24 (Gale Research, 1997),pp. 31-50. For Bernstein, &quot;autobiography&quot;
and &quot;poetry&quot; remain separate entities, his preferred
hybrid, as evident in <U>Content's Dream</U>, <U>A Poetics</U>,
and the forthcoming <U>My Way</U>. being the poetic/critical rather
than the poetic / autobiographical
<P>
In <U>Under Albany</U>, Silliman notes that both <U>Sitting Up,
Standing, Taking Steps</U> and <U>The Chinese Notebook</U> were
written entirely on Golden Gate transit; see p. 3, n. 4.<BR>

31. The irony is that Eliot was the avowed enemy of the New York
Poets; Frank O'Hara, for example, was given to statements like
&quot;Lord! Spare us from any more Fisher kings!&quot; (see my
<U>Frank O'Hara: Poet Among Painters, </U>2d. ed<U>.</U> [Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1997), p. 25, pp. 9-12). In his recent
<U>The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of
Poets</U> (New York: Doubleday, 1998), David Lehman tries to revive
the case for a New York School, emphasizing the group affiliations
of Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, and Kenneth Koch at Harvard, the relations
with painters in New York, and the legacy to the so-called Second
Generation of New York Poets. But the bulk of his book, ironically
enough, contains individual chapters on his chosen four (Ashbery,
O'Hara, Koch, James Schuyler), the unanticipated effect being
to stress difference, both in quality and in mode, rather than
group allegiance. <BR>
