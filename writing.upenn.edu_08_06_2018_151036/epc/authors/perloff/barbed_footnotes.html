The young Johns attended Classical  High School in Lynn, MA., but dropped out before graduating and did not  go on to college; rather, he travelled with his father to Greece, haunted  the Boston bookshops and read voraciously, wrote poems and short stories,  and between 1927-29 studied comparative poetry and literary theory at Columbia.  Having no regular job, Johns decided in the late twenties to start a literary  magazine. For this background and for an excellent scholarly study of the  <I>Pagany</I> archive, with selections from the magazine itself, see Stephen  Halpert (ed., with Richard Johns), <I>A Return to Pagany</I>: <I>The History,  Correspondence, and Selections from a Little Magazine</I> <I>1929-1932  </I>(Boston: Beacon Press,1969). This book is subsequently cited in the  text as ARP.</P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="8"></A><B>8.</B> This role is usually thought to have been played  by Williams: see Stephen Halbert in ARP, passim. But Peter Quartermain,  who has read the unpublished (and currently inaccessible) correspondence  between Richard Johns and Louis Zukofsky, has suggested to me in conversation  that the poetry selections may well reflect the choices of Zukofsky rather  than Williams. This would explain why Zukofsky is never listed under &quot;Contributors'  Notes&quot; in <I>Pagany</I> and why Johns published so many of the Objectivists,  at a time when they were little known. </P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="9"></A><B>9.</B> Richard Johns, &quot;Announcement,&quot; <I>Pagany</I>,  I, 1 (January-March 1930): 1. Subsequently cited in the text as P, followed  by volume number in roman numerals and the issue number in arabic. For  Johns's early reading of admiration of Williams, see the correspondence  between the two in ARP 3-5, and Halpert's commentary on pp. 6ff.</P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="10"></A><B>10.</B> Mary Butts's first husband was the English poet,  critic, printer and publisher John Rodker, who befriended Pound in Paris  and worked with him on various projects; the Surrealist poet Georges Hugnet,  of whose friendship with Stein more below, had written appreciative essays  on Virgil Thomson; Atget, virtually unknown at the time of his death except  by the Surrealist cenacle and other fellow artists, was rescued from oblivion  by the photographer Berenice Abbott, who saved his negatives, printed them,  and brought them to the U.S. for exhibition and sale when she returned  to her native country from Paris in 1929.</P>  <P>Johns's chief contact with Rodker, Thomson, Hugnet et. al. was Sherry  Mangan, Harvard graduate, classicist, and cosmopolitan writer-critic, whom  Johns had befriended in Boston; see ARP 17-20. On 28 August 1929, Mangan  wrote Johns from Paris that he would round up some of the foreign and expatriate  talent. &quot;Djuna [Barnes],&quot; he remarked, &quot;is getting very  snooty, but may be approachable&quot; (see ARP 18). As it turned out, Barnes,  in contrast to Stein, never published in <I>Pagany</I>. </P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="11"></A><B>11.</B> Fredric Jameson,<I>Postmodernism or, The Cultural  Logic of Late Capitalism</I> (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1991),  p. 17.</P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="12"></A><B>12.</B> Mary Butts, &quot;Brightness Falls,&quot; <I>From  Altar to Chimney-Piece.

Johns published Stein on the warm recommendation  of Williams, who insisted that his own essay on Stein (see below) be published  in the first issue. In response to this issue, Stein wrote Johns (ARP 129-30),  &quot;I like you and Pagany, so there we are. Later I will send you a little  thing when it gets done, a play in which only contemporaries appear, it  will amuse you, and Virgil may later do music for it, anyway, we are all  active and pleasant.&quot; </P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="14"></A><B>14.</B> See Williams, <I>Selected Essays</I> (New York:  New Directions, 1954), pp. 113-20; pp. 162-66. In the latter essay, Williams  writes, &quot;Stein has gone systematically to work smashing every connotation  that words have ever had, in order to get them back clean&quot; (p. 163).  </P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="15"></A><B>15.</B> Stein met Georges Hugnet, a young surrealist poet  through Virgil Thomson in 1927. He admired her work, translated some of  her portraits and selections from <I>The Making of </I>Americans , and  together they translated <I>Composition as Explanation</I>. She then offered  to reciprocate by translating into English his suite of poems called <I>Enfances</I>.  But translation was not Stein's game, and as she proceeded, her version  became increasingly &quot;free,&quot; Hugnet's thirty stanzas being rendered  by prose paragraphs as well as brief sentences, and his erotic imagery  being almost entirely elided. Hugnet nevertheless planned to publish the  two versions in book form, again side by side, but Stein objected to what  she saw as her subsidiary position in the venture and broke off all further  contact with Hugnet, as her new title <I>Before the Flowers of Friendship  Faded Friendship Faded</I> suggests.

Gertrude Stein offered to translate it for  him, but instead wrote a poem about it. This at first pleased Georges Hugnet  too much and then did not please him at all. Gertrude Stein then called  the poem 'Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship Faded.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="16"></A><B>16.</B> Stephen Halpert reproduces Stein's telegram (22  December 1930) to Johns, which reads: &quot;TITLE MY POEM IS POEM PRITTEN  ON PFANCES OF GEORGES HUGNET IMPERATIVE (see ARP 216).</P>  <P></P>  <P><A NAME="17"></A><B>17.</B> Marianne DeKoven, <I>A Different Language.
