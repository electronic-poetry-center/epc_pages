<!-------------------   TEXT  ---------------------------------->
<p>
"Happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." 
The famous opening sentence of Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i> means, of course, 
that happiness is a boring, unhappiness a challenging, subject to write about. Almost 
every poet would agree. Death, anxiety, desire, ecstasy, jealousy, despair, fear, 
loneliness: these are natural topoi for lyric, but <i>happiness</i>?</p>


<p>In the <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i>, Aristotle defines <i>happiness</i> as the 
one thing "we choose always for itself and never for the sake of something else." 
"Honor, pleasure, reason, and every excellence we choose &#8230; for the sake of 
happiness, judging that through them we shall be happy. Happiness, on the other 
hand, no one chooses for the sake of these, nor, in general, for anything other 
than itself." Precisely because happiness is thus a final and complete good, no 
man, says Aristotle, can be called "happy" while he lives, for at any moment his 
fortune may change. On the other hand, it would be absurd to call a dead man "happy," 
and so, it seems, no ideal exemplar of happiness presents himself.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein seemed to have solved this dilemma when he wrote, in his wartime 
notebook, "Only a man who lives not in time but in the present is happy."<sup><A HREF="hejinian.html#1">1</A></sup> 
Time is the enemy of happiness in that both memory and anticipation of the future 
point to the death that is to come. For Wittgenstein, happiness is thus an inner 
state of mind, independent of external circumstances and the chance contingencies 
of position or fortune. In a famous aphorism, repeated in the <i>Tractatus</i>, 
happiness can't be defined. There is only tautology: "The world of the happy is 
<i>a happy world.</i>" And further, "if I <i>now</i> ask myself: But why should 
I live <i>happily</i>, this of itself seems to me to be a tautological question; 
the happy life seems to be justified, of itself, it seems that it <i>is</i> the 
only right life."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for this notion of happiness as outside time<i>,</i> the adjective 
<i>happy</i> has the same root as the verb <i>happen</i>&#8212;and if something 
<i>happens</i>, it  marks an event in time. The root of both words, according to 
the Oxford English Dictionary, is the Old English <i>hap</i>, meaning "Chance or 
fortune (good or bad) that falls to anyone." More specifically (definition number 
2), <i>hap</i> is "An event or occurrence which befalls one; a chance, accident, 
happening; often an unfortunate event, mishap, mischance." "That I be no more constreyned," 
we read in Caxton's <i>Golden Legend</i>, "to have soo many cursidnesses or ylle 
happes." But it could just as well mean (number 3), "Good fortune, good luck; success, 
prosperity," so that the element of <i>hap</i> that came to be stressed was (number 
4), "Absence of design or intent in relation to a particular event; fortuity; chance."</p>
<p>The root <i>hap</i>, in any case, gives us <i>hapless</i> ("unlucky'), <i>haphazard</i> 
("without design, random"), and especially <i>happen</i>, "to come to pass, to take 
place." <i>Happen</i>, according to the OED, is "the most general verb to express 
the simple occurrence of an event, often with little or no implication of chance 
or absence of design." But a subsidiary, and now obsolete, meaning of <i>happen</i> 
is "to chance to be or to come," "to turn up"&#8212;as in "Two Officers asked how 
we happened abroad so late." Meanwhile, <i>happen on</i> or <i>upon</i> continues 
to mean "to come upon by chance," as in "Just then, I happened upon him." And so 
the chancy element of happenings is central. As for <i>happy</i>, its first, now 
obsolete, meaning was "coming or happening by chance; fortuitous," as in "The wery 
hunter to fynd his happy prey." The notion of luck, chance, or fortune has never 
disappeared: "Having good 'hap'" meant "to be lucky, fortunate, favoured by lot, 
position, or other external circumstances": "He is happy that a harme hastely amendes." 
As for <i>happily</i>, it was originally <i>haply</i>, "By chance; perchance," which 
soon came to mean, "With or by good fortune, fortunately, luckily, successfully." 
Thus in Shakespeare's <i>Henry VIII</i>: "I am glad I came this way so happily."</p>
<p>Not until the Renaissance does happiness come to be seen as a state of mind not 
necessarily controlled by external fortune. Happiness, in modern parlance (OED definition 
number 2), is "the state of pleasurable content of mind, which results from success 
or the attainment of what is considered good." <i>Happily</i> thus means "with mental 
pleasure or content," and <i>happy</i> comes to be a synonym for "glad" and "pleased": 
"having a feeling of great pleasure or content of mind, arising from satisfaction 
with one's circumstances or conditions." And further (definition number 5), "Successful 
in performing what the circumstances require; apt, dexterous, felicitous."</p>
<p>"What," Wittgenstein asks, "is the objective mark of the happy, harmonious life? 
Here it is again clear that there cannot be any such mark, that can be <i>described.</i>" 
We are back to the childlike tautology: "The world of the happy is <i>a happy world</i>." 
The German word for happy is <i>gl&#252;cklich</i>, which means "lucky" (<i>Gl&#252;ck 
is luck)</i>. Happiness, in this scheme of things, is always tied up with what <i>happens</i>, 
especially what happens by luck or chance.</p>
<p>This etymological paradox&#8212;the tension between a conception of happiness 
as a state of mind independent of time and circumstance, and a conception of happiness 
as chance-ridden and fortuitous&#8212;animates Lyn Hejinian's most recent book, 
<i>Happily</i>, a long poetic sequence first published in 2000 as a minimalist paperback 
by the Post-Apollo Press and then reprinted in <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>, a 
new collection of Hejinian's essays.<sup><A HREF="hejinian.html#1">2</A></sup> Read against such earlier essays 
as "When Written is Writing" (1978) and "The Rejection of Closure" (1983), <i>Happily</i> 
intriguingly combines the techniques of two early Hejinian works&#8212;<i>Writing 
is an Aid to Memory</i> (1978) and the remarkable autobiography <i>My Life</i>, 
whose double incarnation (the 1978 Burning Deck version, written when the poet was 
37, has 37 sections with 37 sentences each; the 1987 Sun &#38; Moon revision changes 
those numbers to 45) suggests that writing the "self" is always an ongoing process.</p>
<p>In <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>, <i>Happily</i> is preceded by a piece called 
"A Common Sense," which is Hejinian's meditation on the meaning of the everyday 
or commonplace in Gertrude Stein's <i>Stanzas in Meditation</i>. "It was through 
participation in the everyday with its 'inevitable repetition,'" writes Hejinian, 
"that Gertrude Stein first came to understand the metaphysical as well as compositional 
force of habit." And she points to the sentence in <i>Portraits and Repetition</i>, 
where Stein says, "No matter how often what happened had happened any time anyone 
told anything there was no repetition. This is what William James calls the Will 
to Live."</p>
<p>To recount the past, Hejinian suggests, is to freeze it; to say "this happened" 
leaves no room for contingency. Repetition in a continuous present, on the other 
hand, assures difference, for no repetition, whether of word or deed, can ever produce 
an exact replica of a now-lost original. The resulting free play, she posits, is 
what James meant by the Will to Live. "And," she adds, "it is what here I am going 
to risk calling happiness." Happiness&#8212;and there is a footnote to this effect&#8212;not 
as the usual condition of "privilege bestowed by fortune (in the form either of 
luck or of money)," but happiness as the awareness of "what happens, happens as 
effects to beings&#8212;things that exist." Whether these things are good or bad 
is not at issue; what matters is that the contemplation of <i>happening</i> arouses 
the "wonder at mere existence"&#8212;for example, an "alertness to the liveliness 
of the present and the everyday, the mode of being that for Stein constituted 'complete 
living.'" "Happiness," says Hejinian, "is a complication, as it were, of the ordinary, 
a folding in of the happenstantial&#8230;. In this respect, it is <i>un</i>like 
<i>un</i>happiness, since unhappiness is a marked condition, firmly attached to 
plots (that of good vs. evil, of love and loss, etc.)," whereas happiness is an 
attentive awareness to the sheer contingency of happenings.</p>
<p>Like Wittgenstein, Hejinian thus relates happiness to <i>presence</i>. It involves 
"taking a chance &#8230; into the present," getting <i>in time</i> rather than meditating 
<i>on</i> time. Here the root <i>hap</i> comes in: Hejinian cites Nietzsche as saying 
that "Happiness arises out of chance, hazard, accident, events, fortune, the fortuitous." 
Its very contingency is a sort of blessing. "In its very ordinariness, [it] says 
<i>yes</i>."</p>
<p>What Hejinian doesn't say in "Common Sense" is that her meditation on happiness 
was triggered by a bout with cancer from which she had recently recovered. In one 
sense, then, <i>Happily</i> is her poetic response to reprieve, to the happiness 
the poet experiences in recognizing her reinsertion into a state of <i>happening</i>. 
The<i> </i>sequence, as Hejinian says in her headnote, was designed as "an affirmation 
of thinking, of thinking's substance and context (what happens), and of writing 
as the site of such thinking." Writing, in this instance, is less an aid to memory, 
as in Hejinian's first major book, than a mode of transformation whereby what the 
poet calls a "marked condition"&#8212;the <i>what happened</i>&#8212;is absorbed 
into the continuous present of happen<i>ing </i>and such related present participles 
as persevering and knowing.</p>
<p>Formally, <i>Happily</i> is a Steinian work, written in a series of sentences, 
exactly 250 of them, ranging from one word to eight lines, and divided into irregular 
"stanzas," perhaps on the model of <i>Stanzas in Meditation</i>. In her headnote, 
the poet talks about her "accordioning" sentences: "ones with solid handles (a clear 
beginning and a clear end) but with a middle that is pleated and flexible" so as 
"to allow for the influx of material that surges into any thought, material that 
is charged with various and sometimes even incompatible emotional tonalities."</p>
<p>But despite its homage to the Stein sentence, <i>Happily</i> strikes me as being 
less Steinian than <i>Oxota</i>, Hejinian's long, parodic Russian "epic" based on 
Pushkin's <i>Eugene Onegin</i>, an oblique homage to the etymological poetries of 
the Russian avant-garde. In <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>, Hejinian frequently 
cites the Russian Formalist theorists&#8212;Jakobson, Shlovsky, Tinyanov&#8212;from 
whom she traces her own concern for the materiality of language and its ability 
to effect <i>ostranenie</i> ("making strange"). <i>Ostranenie</i>, as Hejinian remarks 
in a recent essay on translation, posits relatedness as the primary quality of poetic 
discourse. Relatedness can be imagistic or syntactic, but, in the poetry of Ilya 
Kotuk and Arkadii Dragomoschenko, which she has translated, Hejinian finds it primarily 
in "a high degree of wordplay, often of a type that is dependent on etymological 
associations."</p>
<p>Here Hejinian parts company with Stein, whose unit of composition was the sentence, 
rather than the word as such. Like Susan Howe, Hejinian is fascinated by dictionaries, 
where "words in storage &#8230; seem frenetic with activity, as each individual 
entry attracts to itself other words as definition, example, and amplification." 
One thinks of Khlebnikov tracing the lineage of <i>so</i> ("with") in <i>sol</i> 
("salt") and <i>solntse</i> (sun). Similarly, at the end of "Common Sense," Hejinian 
probes the definition of the word "meditation" in Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary: 
"a discourse intended to express its author's reflections or to guide others in 
contemplation." But, she adds, "the word 'meditation' comes from the Latin, <i>modus</i> 
(measure), and from the Old English, <i>metan</i> (to measure), and for Stein it 
appears to mean a prolonged present cogitation."</p>
<p>And <i>Happily</i> is clearly motivated by the fact that <i>happy</i> and <i>happen</i> 
both derive, as I mentioned earlier, from the root <i>hap</i>, and that even the 
word <i>habit</i>, which has so much to do with <i>happening</i>, begins with the 
letters <i>ha</i>. Indeed, the poetic sequence orchestrates these words, together 
with a carefully plotted set of synonyms. <i>Happen</i> gives us <i>take place</i>, 
<i>arrive,</i> <i>come</i>, <i>recur</i>; <i>hap</i> generates <i>chance</i>, <i>accident</i>, 
<i>hazard</i>, <i>event</i>. But this is the beauty of the poem: the word <i>happily&#8212;</i>the 
adverbial form is preferable to the noun <i>happiness</i>, since modification is 
much more likely to produce contingency than is nominalization, which suggests a 
state of being&#8212;is always just <i>happily,</i> and it appears only three times 
in the sequence as compared to some twenty-odd uses of <i>happen</i>. No synonym, 
it seems, can do <i>happily</i> justice.</p>
<p>Consider the two opening stanzas of <i>Happily</i>:</p>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>Constantly I write this happily<BR>
Hazards that hope may break open my lips<BR>
What I feel is taking place, a large context, long yielding, and to doubt it 
would be a crime against it<BR>
I sense that in stating "this is happening"<BR>
Waiting for us?<BR>
It has existence in fact without that<BR>
We came when it arrived<BR>
Here I write with inexact straightness but into a place in place immediately 
passing between phrases of the imagination<BR>
Flowers optimistically going to seed, fluttering candles lapping the air, persevering 
saws swimming into boards, buckets taking dents, and the hands on the clock turning&#8212;<i>they</i> 
aren't melancholy [&#8230;]<BR><BR>

The day is promising<BR>
Along comes something&#8212;launched in context<BR>
In context to pass it the flow of humanity divides and on the other side unites<BR>
All gazing at the stars bound in a black bow<BR>
I am among them thinking thought through the thinking thought to no conclusion<BR>
Context is the chance that time takes<BR>
Our names tossed into the air scraped in the grass before having formed any opinion 
leaving people to say only that there was a man who happened on a cart and crossed 
a gnarled field and there was a woman who happened on a cart and crossed a gnarled 
field too<BR>
Is happiness the name for our (involuntary) complicity with chance?<BR>
Anything could happen<BR>
A boy in the sun drives nails into a fruit a sign (cloud) in the wind swings<BR>
A woman descends a ladder into mud it gives way<BR>
But today's thought is different</BLOCKQUOTE></p>
<p>
<i>Constantly</i> in the first line immediately provides us with a key to this 
complex meditation. Its primary meaning&#8212;"continuously," "always"&#8212;gives 
way to the secondary sense of "faithfully," "unwaveringly," as in Somerset Maugham's 
<i>The Constant Nymph</i>. The writing is happy because it is dedicated, committed: 
"to doubt it would be a crime against it" (line 3). But "happily" in line 1 is followed 
by "hazards," so as to remind us how "hap-hazard" these moments of writing, these 
"Hazards that hope may break open my lips" really are. To say "this is happening," 
to place oneself <i>inside</i>, is to proceed "happily." And here the notion of 
being in the midst of <i>existence</i> is opposed to the linear narrative of "We 
came when it arrived." To be inside of happening is to be attentive to contingency 
and chance, and to forestall the downward spiral toward closure, here imaged as 
flowers going to seed, "fluttering candles," "persevering saws swimming into boards," 
"buckets taking dents," and of course "the hands on the clock turning"&#8212;all 
these familiar items of everyday life defamiliarized by surprising modifiers, as 
when the flowers "optimistically" go to seed or the saws swim into rather than lacerate 
the boards they cut.</p>
<p>"Context," we read in the next stanza, "is the chance that time takes." "Is happiness 
the name for our (involuntary) complicity with chance?" Yes, but not because "Anything 
could happen"&#8212;that pious clich&#233;&#8212;but because when something does 
happen, we cannot define what it is. The "marked condition" of plot&#8212;"there 
was a man who happened on a cart and crossed a gnarled field and there was a woman 
who happened on a cart and crossed a gnarled field too"&#8212;cannot yield happiness. 
For to look at <i>what happened</i> this way is to objectify events and thus to 
undermine the world of the happy, to become aware that "A boy in sun drives nails 
into a fruit," that "A woman descends a ladder into mud it gives way."</p>
<p>"There is really no single poem," Hejinian remarks in a 1995 dialogue with the 
Serbian poet Dubravka Djuric, also in <i>Language and Inquiry</i>. She cites Jack 
Spicer's letter to Robin Blaser, in <i>Admonitions</i>: "Poems should echo and reecho 
against each other. They should create resonance. They cannot live alone any more 
than we can."<sup><A HREF="hejinian.html#1">3</A></sup> This affords an apt description of the mode of <i>Happily</i>, 
in which accordion sentences, interrupted by aphorisms and pithy statements, mime 
the processes of mind whereby the poet tries to remain in the suspended state of 
existing <i>happily</i> in a state of contiguity&#8212;of metonymy rather than metaphor. 
The very notion of the individual poem&#8212;closed, confined, surrounded by white 
space, and hence marked&#8212;goes against the notion of contingency that is so 
central to Hejinian's ethos. Yet&#8212;and this gives her meditation its edge&#8212;even 
in an open sequence like <i>Happily</i> there can't help being lapses into linearity:</p>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>I can always wait sometimes, other times impatience overcomes me like a disease 
effacing the fingerprints of the naked hand on my inner nature which chance bothered 
to put there, beauty scratched out, and history answered in the affirmative</BLOCKQUOTE></p>
<p>
Impatience and insistence are blocking factors, as is nostalgia:</p>

<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nostalgia is another name for one's sense of loss at the thought that one has 
sadly gone along happily overlooking something, who knows what.</BLOCKQUOTE></p>
<p>
Avoid clear definition, doctrine, clear-cut dialectic. And so the poem avoids 
overt connections&#8212;meter, rhyme scheme, a structure of images, controlling 
metaphor&#8212;in favor of those hidden connections produced by those variants on 
<i>hap</i> and their synonyms and homonyms. Hence sentences are left incomplete, 
pronouns like "it" remain undefined, prepositions signaling time and space relations 
are indeterminate, and sentences don't directly connect and are, at any rate, eminently 
interruptible, whether by questions, maxims, narrative interludes, or merely non-sequitur. 
"The world of the happy," no longer quite the "happy world" of Wittgenstein, is 
subject to everything that <i>happens</i>.</p>
<p>In this context, <i>uncertainty</i> (the word and its cognates appear frequently 
toward the end of the poem) is a virtue: "Of each actuality I'm uncertain and always 
was uncertain and such uncertainty is certain." Chance teaches the poet to trust 
finitude, to dwell, as Emily Dickinson put it, in possibility. The sentence "It's 
between birth and death our commonality and <i>our</i> <i>own</i> birth and death 
we are incapable of experiencing" obliquely points to Wittgenstein's terse formulation, 
"Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through." True, near the end 
of <i>Happily</i>, there is a chill in the air: "Come winter," we read, "I see particularly 
the foreshortened perspective disguise retreat and in no way get arranged." And 
as the poem ends, the talk is of "preparation for what will come next." "That," 
says the poet, "may be the thing and logically we go when it departs." The rupture 
seems definitive&#8212;a long way from happening and happily. But it's only "logically" 
that we go when it departs," and logic has been abandoned from the beginning. So 
the death note is muted, a poignant reminder even as "happily I'm feeling the wind 
in its own right."</p>
<p> Chances are that the cycle will continue: "Every moment was better later and 
it greatly changed appearance." Like Hejinian's re-visionary <i>My Life</i>, <i>Happily</i> 
faces toward the future, toward those "beginnings that reason can motivate but not 
end." In its enactment of the Flaubertian principle that "sentences" should be "erect 
while running," <i>Happily</i> is less memory piece (the <i>what happened)</i> than 
an ode to a happy contingency. &#8226;</p>
