        [This conversation was conducted by email between October 15 and November 
        22, 2002. I sent Charles one or two questions at a time, and he responded 
        exactly as he saw fit. There are two major threads here: (1) the changing 
        state of poetry culture over the past two decades and the response of 
        pedagogy to those changes, and (2) a discussion of specific Bernstein 
        poems and how they work. The second area is one Bernstein has often seemed 
        reluctant to talk about.] <br>

        <b>Marjorie Perloff:</b> Charles, almost twenty years have gone by since 
        that fateful MLA when you delivered the lecture "The Academy in Peril: 
        William Carlos Williams Meets the MLA" (1983). I still remember what a 
        tempest you caused and how furious the old timers like M. L. Rosenthal 
        were at your demolition job. You were, in those days, a great fighter 
        against "official verse culture." How does the "situation in poetry" today 
        relate to that earlier moment? Do you feel the fight against official 
        verse culture has been won? Can it ever be won? How would you describe 
        the current scene vis-&agrave;-vis that of 1983? <br>
        <br>
        <b>Charles Bernstein:</b> I remember after that speech - and it was more 
        a speech than a "paper" - Allen Ginsberg told me that while he liked what 
        I said, I should talk more slowly and breathe between phrases. I think 
        I must have been going at twice the words per minute than the other people 
        at the MLA, but they seemed to get the drift. I don't think I've slowed 
        down in the meantime, but then I'm more a tortoise type than quick like 
        a bunny. <br>
        <br>
        <b>MP:</b> You a tortoise?? You'll have a hard time convincing your friends 
        of that because you are in fact super-quick on the uptake though I agree 
        you're not a bunny! <br>
        <br>
        <b>CB:</b> Well, slow and steady and all that, if not unrelenting. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it as a given that the situation 
        has changed; but I believe the necessity to respond to our current predicament 
        is as acute now as ever. In 1983, I didn't anticipate that my remarks 
        would provoke repeated waves of applause, though I did expect the ire. 
        The response to that talk, and lots of other interventions many of us 
        were making at the time, suggested that certain long-entrenched views 
        about American modernist poetry were collapsing under the weight of their 
        own dogmatism, if dogmatism can be said to have weight and not just bark. 
        It was a commonplace, in those distant days of yore, to accuse those of 
        us questioning such dogmatism of being dogmatic; but I have long found 
        that some of the more narrow-minded people are the quickest to cry "Ideologue!" 
        at those who question their prerogatives. Of course -- 
        <blockquote> Today we live in far different times: <br>
          We have no poetry wars, no aesthetic crimes; <br>
          At last, we are all one big family <br>
          Under the tent of art and harmony. </blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I sometimes ask Felix, my ten-year-old 
        son, if my silliness is going to cause him some future harm, I mean things 
        like breaking out into doggerel in the middle of lunch, or telling jokes 
        that are all schtick and no punch line.) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I think has changed is that the radical 
        modernism I was putting forward in that address - poets and poetics - 
        has received much greater acknowledgement since that time, both inside 
        and outside the academy, as the result of the advocacy of many poets, 
        scholars, and editors. At the same time, modern and contemporary poetry 
        is, if anything, becoming more peripheral to literary studies, in the 
        universities but also in elementary and high schools. Nor has the problem 
        with "official verse culture" disappeared, despite far greater prominence 
        for several of my contemporaries and the continued resilience of many 
        of the approaches to poetry that met with so much resistance in the 70s 
        and 80s. I do think that Creative Writing programs, taken in aggregate, 
        are more open now to alternative approaches to poetic composition; but 
        when I read The <i>Writer's Chronicle</i> of the Associated Writing Programs, 
        I mostly see the same problems many of us criticized two decades ago, 
        though now expressed with a kind of embattled, nostalgic tinge of those 
        who have know their ground is more like thin ice: better to skate on than 
        to pound. I find the publication rather charming, in a perverse way. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost any poet will tell you not enough 
        poetry gets reviews in publications-with-wide-circulation (PWC): big city 
        newspapers, the newsweeklies, and the national journals of culture and 
        opinion. Part of the problem would simply be solved if poetry were treated 
        by these publications as a national cultural "beat": if poetry were covered 
        the way art or TV is. But the reality is that poetry is economically too 
        small potatoes (even if the potatoes are sweet) to be able to count this 
        way. The larger problem is that contemporary poetry books suffer the same 
        neglect as contemporary philosophy books (as Peter Hare pointed out to 
        me recently) or really any number of "scholarly" books, books not intended 
        for a "general" audience partly because the general audience is kept ignorant 
        of their existence and the chronic significance for their lives, if we 
        consider the life of the mind essential for the body politic. And while 
        you might make an argument for the fact that poetry ought to be of greater 
        "general" interest than these other "difficult" books, I wouldn't, since 
        I see the fate of all of us as related to a lack of judgment, a lack of 
        cultural and intellectual commitment, on the part of the PWC. In contrast, 
        I am impressed and grateful that such small publications as <i>The Boston 
        Review </i>and <i>Rain Taxi</i> can offer more thorough and thoughtful 
        book reviewing than the combined efforts of the PWC. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to poetry, the PWC do a great 
        disservice to their readers: their coverage is, to use the terms of opprobrium 
        so popular in their reviews, inadequate and of poor quality. Almost no 
        coverage is given of the field, something that is otherwise the prerequisite 
        of journalism, and the choices of what is reviewed seem at best arbitrary, 
        though obviously skewed to the trade presses, even though these presses, 
        by almost anyone's measure, are responsible for only a small proportion 
        of the significant poetry of our time. (Sometimes this point gets misunderstood: 
        It's not that I think that any given book that is reviewed is no good 
        or that no book I care about is ever reviewed nor that I think only the 
        books I prefer should be reviewed or that if a few of them were that would 
        solve the problem.) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, and to put it baldly, I think 
        only a very few of the poetry books published over the past twenty years 
        that you or I would value most highly have received any attention in the 
        PWC; no matter how important these works may be for many of us involved 
        with the art, they remain invisible to the literate reader who relies 
        on these publications for news of what is going on in poetry. There is 
        a connection here to literary prizes, too: not so much who wins them - 
        since there are a great number with many different perspectives - but 
        which ones get reported in the PWC. The Pulitzer, one among many prizes 
        at least its equal (and one with a track record as bad as, but similar 
        to, the PWC) - gets special attention because it is a journalism award: 
        an award given by a group that cares little or nothing for poetry but 
        gives plenty of attention to its self-promotion in its own organs. I recall 
        when Jackson Mac Low won the lifetime achievement award (then called the 
        Dorothea Tanning and now the Wallace Stevens prize) from the Academy of 
        American Poets in 1999, there wasn't even a mention of that in <i>The 
        New York Times</i>, which nonetheless has often reported on the award, 
        calling it poetry's best paying prize; but then Mac Low, even when honored 
        by nothing less than Official Verse Culture at its best, is presumably 
        one of the unmentionables in the land of the PWC. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it matter? It's not that the books 
        don't circulate or are not taught in universities or discussed in small 
        press and web journals or on listserv discussion groups. What difference 
        does it make? I know a lot of people are indifferent, focusing their critiques 
        more on universities than the PWC. But I think what Andrew Ross called 
        "the oxygen of publicity" matters quite a bit. Poetry survives and thrives 
        nurtured by its committed readers and practitioners, but I think the value 
        of poetry is not just for us but indeed for this wider public and that 
        the culture suffers when it isolates itself from its poets. <br>
        <br>
        <b>MP:</b> What you describe seems to me entirely accurate but it's more 
        symptom than cause, isn't it? If the PWCs felt that the public "out there" 
        had even the slightest interest in the material in question, of course 
        they would review it and write articles about it. And the university presses 
        would want to do more to promote the work. So where did this vacuum come 
        from? Is it that English Departments themselves have abdicated their "literary" 
        role, wanting desperately to teach and study anything but "literature"? 
        Is it just a general dumbing down of the culture? But if the latter is 
        the case, why do certain very difficult works get quite a bit of attention? 
        For instance Oulipo. Perec's <i>Life a User's Manual</i> had, I recall, 
        a front-page review in the <i>TLS</i> and even <i>La Disparition</i>, 
        translated by Gilbert Adair, did relatively well. And then in the architecture 
        world, people will pour into shows of very arcane and avant-garde material--I'm 
        thinking of a recent Coop Himmelblau exhibit at the Schindler house in 
        LA--, and my hairdresser, to give just one example, went all the way to 
        Bilbao to see the Frank Gehry Guggenheim Museum and he'll go see Surrealist 
        art shows at this or that museum. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is it about "poetry" today that 
        makes it seem so "specialized" to people? Or, to the question another 
        way, why do people accept the "new" and unexpected in architecture and 
        often in the visual arts in general, but want their poetry to be "clear" 
        &agrave; la Billy Collins? <br>
        <br>
        <b>CB:</b> You tell me. There are so many directions to go in answer to 
        your question I feel like the guy at the end of Bergman's <i>The Passion 
        of Anna</i> who is pacing from the left to the right of the screen with 
        that drop-dead chilling voiceover, "This time his name is Andreas Winkelman." 
        <i>This time it's name is American poetry</i>. On the one hand, yes of 
        course the PWCs are responding to a profound lack of interest in poetry 
        as an art form; but, on the other hand, do they aid or even foment this 
        disinterest, or are they just the messengers reporting the news? Why do 
        they cover the poetry they do cover rather than something else? Why is 
        the aesthetic right given such free reign to trash "radical poetry" while 
        the views of the other sides (all 44 and a half of them) go largely unheard? 
        By the standards of "massed" media, none of this poetry - not any of it 
        - amounts to a hill of beans in Iowa or a barrel of orangutans in the 
        new Times Square. On the one hand (if you can keep all these hands away 
        from the threshing machines), some poets and poetry do-gooders think the 
        answer is to go with the flow, to try to make poems that, while still 
        unpopular at the Prom of American Culture are a little more popular (and 
        don't assume I am not one of them). The classic 50s response is to become 
        Raincoat Adolescents, the hip-without being-cool dropouts or rebel saints 
        that figure, as social gesture, into the Romantic Ideology of a Rock 'n' 
        Roll culture that replaces poetic work with poetic attitude and whose 
        heroes are not poets at all but pop stars like Jim Morrison or Bob Dylan 
        or Patti Smith. I don't really need easy listening poetry if I can listen 
        to the Sex Pistols or New Formalism if I have Randy Newman. For "My Generation" 
        (formally the journal of the American Association of Retired Persons), 
        it's not the anti-modernist poetry championed by the Mediocracy that is 
        clawing at poetry's share of the consciousness of the American muddled 
        class but the Golden 60s Boxed Set rerereleases of <i>The Who's Greatest 
        Hits</i> (What's on second, Leonard Cohen shortstop, Joni Mitchell on 
        bass). They paved Poetry Paradise and put up a Pop Music Lot. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Popularity or immediate accessibility is 
        not a criterion of value for poetry in our time. Poetry can provide not 
        an extension of the dominant values in American culture - as the poetry 
        favored by the PWC does - but multiple, discrepant alternatives to them: 
        often messy, inchoate, disturbing, unhappy - indeed sometimes <i>worse</i> 
        - alternatives to boot. How the culture and how the PWC responds to this 
        is a judgment on them. A culture's refusal of its poetry is not without 
        consequence or redress. So when you ask if "the public [has] even the 
        slightest interest in the <i>material in question</i>," I would say that 
        the PWC's spurning of this, indeed, material in question, is a direct 
        violation of the public interest, that we won't have a public worthy of 
        the name until we engage with such material, in poetry, philosophy, history, 
        sociology, theology, and, indeed, politics. <br>
        <br>
        <b>MP:</b> Touch&eacute;. I think there's also a "skill" or "expertise" 
        problem. To be an architect, you do have to learn very specific things. 
        And a composer obviously has to know something about music. But anyone, 
        it seems, can be a poet. <i>The New York Times</i> praised Dana Gioia 
        precisely because he had worked for ten years for General Foods and made 
        his mint before turning to poetry-evidently something one can do by a 
        sheer act of will. One declares oneself a poet, period. So then anyone 
        of course can also be a poetry critic and comment on the quality of the 
        poetry. This past week <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> announced that Gioia 
        was one of "our finest poets" without ever saying how or why. It seems 
        their columnists simply <i>know</i>. And in response to the staggering 
        multi-million Gertrude Lilly bequest to <i>Poetry</i> magazine, Joseph 
        Parisi, the venerable journal's current editor, produced some sobering 
        statistics. For instance, the circulation of <i>Poetry</i> today is 10,000. 
        But every year the journal gets 90,000 submissions. Poetry, it would seem, 
        is much more fun to write than to read! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, Ph.D. programs like the Poetics 
        Program at Buffalo have gone a long way in rectifying this situation and 
        demanding some knowledge on the part of their would-be poets. Could you 
        comment on how this has worked at Buffalo? Since the program is largely 
        your brainchild, how did you go about inventing it? What are its best 
        features? Are there things you would now do differently? <br>
        <br>
        <b>CB:</b> In terms of reviewing and awards, there is sometimes a presumption 
        that a person who never reads poems and has no apparent interest in poetry 
        should be able to judge what's good or bad in poetry, because we are all 
        "human beings" after all, as the coordinator of a recent very-minor-award 
        panel informed me a few days ago. Sometimes that goes for the "general 
        reader" qualifications of the reviewer/judge and sometimes it's a criteria 
        used to evaluate poetry. The "we're all humans" proposition is not just 
        a harmless shibboleth: it is a chief means of riding roughshod over aesthetic 
        and ideological differences and enforcing - now here's a ten buck word 
        - <i>uniformitarianism</i>. The poets I most care about are, maybe, trying 
        to <i>become</i> human - or nonhuman; anyway, they are not so quick to 
        assume what the human is or how it manifests itself. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with lots of poetry that bills 
        itself as easy reading is that there's not a lot of there there, or what 
        there there is doesn't hold up to more than a quick and casual glance. 
        The irony is that "difficult" poetry may actually provide a good deal 
        more immediacy and affect than much of the more "I am my subject matter 
        and don't you forget it" variety. That's why I would cast the issue in 
        terms not just of aesthetics but aestheticism - <i>linguistic sensation</i>. 
        There is much still made of the alleged problem that lots of the poems 
        you and I like to read are not point, click, and play; but the alternative 
        provided is not like asking the readers to write their own poems (though 
        that's a fine activity too, for another time) or stare into the abyss 
        (though that may be something that comes up along the way). The difference 
        is more like the one between riding a motorbike and taking a taxi (substitute 
        your own engine-free metaphor if you like). Personally, I prefer teleportation, 
        since that gives me more time for reading hard-core poetry. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the Poetics Program: university English 
        departments typically separate poetry writing courses from poetry reading 
        courses and we all know that the former are on the rise while the latter 
        are on the wane. The Poetics Program, as we formed it in the early 1990s 
        in Buffalo, rejected this dichotomy, not just in an informal, or class-by-class, 
        basis, but as a matter of policy; and not just at an undergraduate or 
        master's level, but also, and even primarily, in the Ph.D. program. The 
        poets teaching in our graduate Poetics Program - Susan Howe, Robert Creeley, 
        Myung Mi Kim, Loss Pequeno Glazier, Dennis Tedlock - teach not creative 
        writing but rather doctoral seminars; the students don't submit poems 
        or manuscripts, but essays and dissertations. The Poetics Program students 
        are often poets and we support the activity of writing poetry as a positive 
        contribution to teaching literature classes, writing criticism, and doing 
        scholarship. This is not to say that all the Poetics students are poets, 
        but lots of them are and they have formed their own immediate local context 
        of exchanging work, publishing magazines and books, and organizing reading 
        series. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No poetry community is without troubles, 
        and ours has its share, but it is vital and sizable and even formidable 
        since our program, having surprising little competition among Ph.D. programs, 
        has attracted (in early and not-so-early stages) some great poets, scholars, 
        critics, editors over the years. Because we have some funds available, 
        we are able to provide a small amount of money to any of the students 
        who want to have a series or press - and that little bit of money goes 
        a long way. This approach to funding - giving to a highly decentered not 
        to say idiosyncratic set of project can lead, as Joel Kuszai put it a 
        while back, to a place with "all leaders and no followers"; but at least 
        it avoids the committee-driven decision making of many official university 
        magazines and reading series, where money is centralized and consensus 
        is emphasized. Anyway, this has been my philosophy. We also have lots 
        and lots of visitors, who meet with students in seminars as well as give 
        readings or lectures. So it's all very poetry intense, with lots of fellow 
        poetry devotees and lots of activities. And also a strong web presence, 
        with the Electronic Poetry Center and also the Poetics List. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back, I think the Poetics Program 
        was an intervention particularly relevant for the 1990s and so one that 
        now needs to undergo some serious and necessary transformations, as I 
        think all institutions do, less they become stagnant, victim of their 
        own successes or preoccupied with their own failures. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is always a lot of concern expressed 
        among poets about the relation of poetry to the academy. (I wish I could 
        say there was comparable concern in the literary academy for this topic.) 
        Without jumping into the quicksand of this topic, I would say that my 
        own commitment has been to find ways to use the university and its resources 
        to support poets and poetry, especially poets outside the academy. As 
        I said in an interview with Andrew Epstein for <i>Lingua Franca</i> on 
        this topic, the issue isn't that, as a poet, you have a university job, 
        but what you do with it. <br>
        <br>
        <b>MP:</b> I've always felt the "issue" of the poet in the academy was 
        a red herring. Poets have to make a living somehow and some choose teaching 
        even as others (Kit Robinson, Ron Silliman) work in the computer industry, 
        and others as lawyers or psychiatrists. But enough sociology; I want to 
        turn now to your poetry, which, it seems to me, has gotten somewhat short 
        shrift vis-&agrave;-vis your essays, manifestos, lectures, etc. Especially 
        in the UK, critics and reviewers talk of you as the <i>chef d'&eacute;cole</i> 
        of the Language school rather than as the very particular poet than you 
        are. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose we look at what I take to be a 
        particularly brilliant recent poem, "The Manufacture of Negative Experience," 
        in <i>With Strings</i> (Chicago, 2001). What was the actual process of 
        composing this long poem? Where did you begin? Do you start with a particular 
        conception and then "fill in," or does one perception immediately lead 
        to a further perception, as Olson put it? Do you assemble the found texts 
        ahead of time? Do you move passages around a lot? In short (ha!), can 
        you describe for our readers how composition took place. <br>
        <br>
        <b>CB:</b> I wrote the poem, using some notes I had assembled over the 
        previous year, in Provincetown in August 1992. I was there with Susan 
        of course, but also with Emma, who was seven (echoes of her presence in 
        &sect;41 - "When I say 'no' I mean /maybe, probably not, what's / the 
        matter with you?, do I / make myself clear? ..."), and Felix, who, at 
        a few months old, may well be the "beeper" of &sect;333. Like most of 
        my poems, I wrote this one in a bound "sketch"-type notebook, then typed 
        it up and revised. "The Manufacture of Negative Experience" is one of 
        a number of longish serial poems: loosely linked stanzas, all bouncing 
        off of, or getting sucked into, the black hole of the title. It's a constellation 
        or array, or then again maybe something like a charm bracelet. One of 
        the charms is &sect;482: the set of jokes in the form of one-line questions, 
        all with same answer, "No." One of my obsessions has been to include - 
        fully and faithfully (or is it faithlessly, I always get those confused) 
        - a set of Henny Youngman-style jokes within a poem. So here it's 11 questions 
        spread over 15 lines. And those questions also rhyme with similar jokes 
        or quasi jokes in other parts of the poem. (Was that a real joke or did 
        you just mess it up?) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are thirteen parts to the poem. Another 
        way I think of these is as something like conical sections arcing around 
        a numinous center (negative experience). That's one way to understand 
        erratic numbering (3, 17, 37, 38, 41, 46a, 57, 71, 333, 334, 482, 501, 
        788), which is both one of those stock jokes I like so much, while at 
        the same time giving a sense of the space between the sections. The form 
        is probably more like Wittgenstein's <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> 
        than Olson's <i>Projective Verse</i>, but it's true I want the parts to 
        concatenate. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of contrasting materials by way of 
        language, style, prosody, subject matter: fractured aphorisms and slogans 
        (&sect;38), semi-nursery rimes (&sect;17, &sect;57), speech acts (&sect;41), 
        riddles with no answer if not no for an answer, and some parts that combine 
        these (&sect;3). A lot of the poem sounds like you've heard it before 
        but can't place it or just when you think you remember, it's on the slip 
        of your tongue until it gets bounced out of mind by a quick dissolve to 
        the next illusionless allusion or allusive elision, or a pop fly to third 
        when you still don't know who's on first. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that, again, brings up the title as 
        organizing principle: less negative experience as in "I had a very negative 
        experience at polka night at the supper club" and more as in Adorno's 
        "Negative Dialectics": "Truth is the antithesis of existing society" (which 
        is the epigraph to a related poem, "Emotions of Normal People" in <i>Dark 
        City</i>). Or like that great "Not this" in Ron Silliman's <i>Tjanting</i>. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 37 is taken from a school report 
        on my twin nephews, who were in elementary school at the time. I jotted 
        those sentences down when I was over to my sister- and brother-in-law's 
        house for Thanksgiving. I am one of these mildly unsocial people at family 
        gatherings who do things like that: scribble things in my notebook from 
        school reports, scan the popular magazines on the table, record overheard 
        conversation, all in the endless quest for material. School reports are 
        classic fodder for my hypnopompic mill: such school blotter characterizing 
        may not kill you but the wounds ... they don't so much heal as morph. 
        I identify with everything that's said about David and Ian and so those 
        statements form the poetics of the piece. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess, to get back to your question, 
        a lot of the poem is pulled from the air, from signs in my mind and on 
        the street, from what I am reading in the newspaper or hearing on the 
        radio, everything gets considered as possible material to be transmuted, 
        sputtered, turned topsy turvy or tipsy flopsy. As if "negative experience" 
        could be the portal into a world next to the one we usually pretend to 
        inhabit, less through the looking glass than the blank side of the mirror 
        that doesn't reflect but allows for reflection. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in writing this I was casting 
        around for an adjective to go with "mill" to describe the fuzzy logic 
        of interconnections in the poem; for some reason hypnogogic came to mind, 
        but I wanted something that meant the opposite, which is when I lighted 
        on hyponopompic: a state of dawning consciousness, just after sleep. Meanwhile, 
        while working on this explanation, and it was getting late, Emma wanted 
        to use the computer to play a biology CD-ROM, so all of a sudden, out 
        of the blue, I heard this disembodied, hypercalm voice, talking about 
        the plasma membrane of a cell as a "fluid mosaic" and I realized this 
        was another way of talking about poetic structure; in this case, the internal 
        elements that make up each section as well as the relation among the sections. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which leads me to &sect;3: "Madder / than 
        a scratched eel at a / Crossing Guard kettle-shoot." The kettle shoot 
        is always the highlight of the Crossing Guard annual convention in Whipsalantamariaozoola, 
        even though the scratched eel underwater diving meet is my personal favorite. 
        Well ,you'd have to have been there to take it in fully; this was the 
        best way to evoke the experience, a painful one that I will remember for 
        the rest of my life. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What else to say? As you see, I guess I 
        am more tempted to write another stanza than offer up an explanation. 
        Not that I mind explaining anything, which anyway is always more a supplement 
        than a substitute, or so I would hope. <br>
        <br>
        <b>MP:</b> Your account shows how absurd it is to talk of yours as a poetry 
        where "anything goes," indeed, how carefully you plan the poem's overall 
        architecture. But I still have some questions. First and foremost-and 
        this would apply to most of your poems, whether in With Strings or in 
        earlier volumes-how does the reader deal with the hermeticism of the allusions? 
        In &sect;37, for example, once you explain that Ian and David are your 
        sister-in-law's twins, the section is perfectly clear. But if I didn't 
        know that, I would assume that Ian is a character, perhaps in Cowper's 
        Task, perhaps in another Cowper poem or related text, and that you're 
        modernizing the situation for parodic effect. Now, you can say it doesn't 
        matter, that the thematic import would be the same. But it does help (I've 
        found) if the reader knows the New York world you're so often referring 
        to-a world of those Henny Youngman jokes and phrases like "a wolf in schlep's 
        clothing." So I wonder whether you think some day your poems will or should 
        be annotated by editors? And of course if this were the case, the annotations 
        would be longer than the original poem or perhaps themselves a new poem, 
        which might be fun. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm of two minds about the question of 
        reference. Part of me feels that anyone living in today's media world, 
        whether in Helsinki or Hackensack, will read "The Manufacture of Negative 
        Experience" with a big smile and a great shock of recognition. But then 
        I'm always surprised how many people even in (or perhaps especially in) 
        our own social circles, have never heard of No-Doze, pastrami, the Aswan 
        Dam, or the self-help movement. For example, at the recent Modernist Studies 
        Association meeting in Madison, I was astonished to learn that none of 
        the people I was dining with-the poet Cole Swensen, the philosopher Jean-Pierre 
        Cometti (French visitor, very sophisticated, who writes on Wittgenstein 
        and Musil), or the young poet-critic-academic Craig Dworkin-had ever seen 
        <i>The Godfather</i> or knew anything about it. I assumed EVERYONE had 
        seen that film, or part of it, at one time or another. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So-to pose what is probably an impossible 
        question: how do we deal with complex cultural reference in the Age of 
        Billy Collins and Dana Gioia? Yours is, to quote William James on Gertrude 
        Stein, "a fine new kind of realism." I see you as one of the central chroniclers 
        of our culture. But can we ask readers to know what Charles Bernstein 
        knows? <br>
        <br>
        <b>CB:</b> We have to make the reader an offer she can't refuse, can't 
        even imagine refusing, whether or not all the references are known, and 
        all this within the limits of poetry alone (that is, the threat is not 
        of diminished physical capacity but of diminished aesthetic capacity, 
        which remains a looming threat for many Americans). By <i>refuse</i>, 
        I mean that turning away in the face of the daunting challenge of decoding 
        the references, conceits, forms before even starting to read the poem. 
        My idea, and certainly not mine alone, was to make poems that allowed 
        for ambient access, that you start by getting the hang of, more than figuring 
        out. It doesn't mean that at some other point in your experience with 
        the poem you won't ponder those obscure references but that the poem encourages 
        you to go on what you experience not just what you already know. Pragmatism, 
        pragmatism, joggity jag. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll remember the Chinese translator, 
        in the giddy conclusion to A Test of Poetry (in <i>My Way</i>), asked 
        just the question you raise about the title of my poem "No Pastrami" ("Does 
        the pastrami refer to a highly seasoned shoulder cut of beef?"). But, 
        then, what is the meaning of pastrami? Would it be enough to define it 
        ethnically or would you really have to have a slice and not just a slice 
        but a pastrami on rye at the Carnegie, but wouldn't the Stage be better?, 
        or maybe only the Second Avenue Deli would do.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Yes we have no pastrami, yes we have 
        no pastrami today.</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interesting thing about the translator's 
        questions in <i>A Test of Poetry</i> is that the difficulty posed by the 
        poems were not syntactic or grammatic or even structural but rather questions 
        of cultural reference, especially from American popular, local, and mass 
        culture. That's partly because this particular translator was a scholar 
        of American poetry and was able to navigate through those formal aspects 
        of the poems more readily; though another reader, someone who shared my 
        mass and pop cultural experience but not my poetic interests, might have 
        just the opposite difficulty. Still, the Chinese translator's predicament 
        is hardly unique to non-Americans, but, rather, is a defining condition 
        for everyone in American culture. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone who teaches contemporary literature 
        will have the experience that the most common cultural references of their 
        own younger days are as obscure as Greek myths to those waves of ever 
        younger people who were not "in" the culture at that time. The bigger 
        they are, the harder they fall. ("All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for 
        my close-up," as some of us will recall Norma Desmond saying in <i>Hollywood 
        Boulevard</i>.) You sometimes hear people lament the decline of the big 
        three TV networks as creating a crisis of decentralization, as if Lloyd 
        Bridges on <i>Sea Hunt</i> provided a shared national experience that 
        we now suffer from the lack of, as we contend with the dispersed sons 
        of Lloyd: Beau and Jeff. I use this example - knowing full well that you 
        may never have heard of <i>Sea Hunt</i>, which had its TV first run from 
        1957 to 1961 and which had a kind of ominous, not quite existential, feel 
        - because it was turned down by the networks and was an early example 
        of syndication that ultimately robbed "us in the U.S." of the common culture 
        ... like they had over there in Russia, with the one TV station?! The 
        web, which makes 50s TV syndication seem like the tiniest hairline fracture 
        of network hegemony, provides quick information on an amazing range of 
        once-famous references, Sea Hunt and the Aswan Dam included. (I guess 
        for my work you can't go too far wrong thinking of the 50s and the Cold 
        War as a possible backdrop, once you start to see the pattern.) Google 
        is both a veritable Guide to the Perplexed and a fomenter of perplexity, 
        both a handle on, and a downward slope into, the Babel (or is it Bible?) 
        of information on the Internet and the concomitant eclipse of central 
        authority. (Lately I've been fascinated by the difference between the 
        web sites developed for poets, say on the EPC, and the fan sites you get 
        for every which manner of things, like the one for Sea Hunt.) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You touch on some of these issues in fundamental 
        and illuminating ways in your recent essay, "The Search for Prime Words: 
        Ezra Pound as Nominalist" on the use of proper names in Pound, and Yunte 
        Huang also addresses this issue in a recent piece, "Was Ezra Pound a New 
        Historicist?" The question in both your essays is - How are we supposed 
        to know the significance of certain anecdotal references in <i>The Cantos</i>? 
        In both Eliot's and Pound's modernist practice, there is a professed commitment 
        to a canon of Historical Events and Cultural Works that are presented 
        with the (implied) injunction that readers have an obligation to know 
        what they are or, if not, learn about them. Stein and Williams might stand 
        for the opposite if those Proper Names weren't ones that you and I, after 
        all is done and said, would expect those reading this exchange to know 
        about (or if they didn't possibly prompt them to find out). The problem 
        you and Yunte raise in regard to Pound's work is whether we are take his 
        anecdotal references as such luminous details, especially if they refer 
        to his own particular experiences, such as restaurants he visited in New 
        York or Paris. (Do readers of this exchange really need to know the difference 
        between the Stage and the Carnegie?) Yunte argues that you always need 
        paratextual information and that there is not necessarily a value in imagining 
        a poem as self-evident: I stare at the page and all the significance of 
        the Proper Names immediately manifests itself to me, to ponyback (or is 
        it pigtail?) on Pound's famous and equally problematic remark about the 
        status of the Chinese written character. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poems can't go it alone and never could, 
        relying, as they so often do, not only on the kindness of strangers but 
        the testimony of friends. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Poetry is too important to be left to 
        its own devices</i>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpretation is act, editing a form of 
        writing, translation a condition of reading. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no end to what you might need 
        to know to read a poem and maybe no beginning either. In my textual economy, 
        each poem is an initiation into a world of particulars both inside and 
        outside the reader's information databank. The question is: Does that 
        which is unrecognized in the poem make the work more forbidding or more 
        beckoning. In the kind of poems I want, you don't need secret "abracadabra" 
        words or some special knowledge or even explanatory annotations to open 
        the door of the poem. Rather, all that's needed is a willingness to jump 
        into the middle of a flow of experience, just as you do every time you 
        open up the door to your house onto that other world we sometimes call 
        everyday life. The fact is that as a culture we don't share a fixed set 
        of given, all purpose, cultural and historical references or, insofar 
        as we do, there are relatively few of them and, taken as topological points, 
        they make an inadequate map of our history, our contemporaneity, our aspirations 
        and destinies. I don't want my poems to impose a sense of what's most 
        important on the world or on those readers who care to take the journey 
        the poems offer. But the ecology of reference does concern me: creating 
        a mix so that everyone gets some things but no one can get everything 
        - and counting on both. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mention the wolf's in schleps' clothing 
        but I remain more concerned about the schleps in wolf's clothing, the 
        paper tigers of poetry. Or there is the one about the difference between 
        the schlemiel and schlemazel: the schlemiel is the one spills the soup; 
        the schlemazel is the one who it gets spilled on. You could say that this 
        is just the difference between the poet and the reader, in my semiotic 
        economy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So maybe, going back again to &sect;37, 
        the dedication to William Cowper's <i>The Task</i> is the more significant 
        frame and I was leading you down the garden path of anecdote in my comments 
        on David and Ian. Negative experience necessarily engages what you don't 
        know: The manufacture of negative experience - going on in the midst of 
        uncertainty of reference, bearing, morality, truth - is the task of poetry. 
        In <i>The Task</i> (1782-85), Cowper writes: 
        <blockquote> When Winter soaks the fields, and ... feet<br>
          Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay,<br>
          Or ford the rivulets, are best at home,<br>
          The task of new discoveries falls on me.<br>
          At such a season and with such a charge<br>
		  Once went I forth, and found, till then unknown ...<br>
        </blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the task of poetry is "new discoveries," 
        what is the task of criticism? <br>
        <br>
        <b>MP:</b> I love the aphorism "<i>Poetry is too important to be left 
        to its own devices</i>." Vintage Bernstein in that it sounds at once wholly 
        familiar (we're always talking about something being too important to 
        be left to its - or his or her - own devices) and yet it is completely 
        absurd. Or is it? Poetry does have "devices"-rhyme, repetition, anaphora, 
        assonance, onomatopoeia, metaphor, metonymy, pun, simile-but device alone 
        can't make something poetry, as too few "poets" realize. So your little 
        proverb is only too true, it turns out. The particular feat of your poetry, 
        I'd say, is this doubleness or tripleness or quintupleness .... Every 
        statement looks in more than one direction, which is, of course, what 
        poetry is all about and always has been. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reader needn't know all the allusions. 
        When I first read "Gertrude and Ludwig's Bogus Adventure" (<i>My Way</i>) 
        I had no idea what those Pete Hewitt "Excellent Adventure" films were. 
        Boy films, kid films, science fiction-not at all my thing. But even without 
        knowing the actual films referred to, the meanings come through well enough. 
        On the other hand, once told about the films, I became quite intrigued 
        with looking them up, rather the way I now love reading about "the cake 
        shops on the Nevsky" Pound writes of and which he never saw any more than 
        I've seen them! That's what makes poetry so infinitely re-readable. And 
        poetry that has none of this thickness quickly gets boring. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's another point. Yes, one can 
        do without knowing all the references but there's also the unavoidable 
        fact that sooner or later, readers WILL look them up. In twenty year's 
        time, someone will write an essay or thesis on your poetry and they'll 
        go to the Stage and the Carnegie and have a look at the pastrami!! After 
        all, in their day, Eliot and Pound, not to mention Stein or Duchamp, were 
        felt to be hopelessly hermetic, and now students talk about the Oculist 
        Witnesses in the <i>Large Glass</i>, as if it were all part of normal 
        discourse. And in the case of Frank O'Hara, where I used to think most 
        of the person and place names were intentionally fortuitous, now scholars 
        are writing solemn treatises about the significance of lunching at Larré's 
        on 56th St, or on the meaning of <i>Gauloises</i>. And since younger people 
        have no idea who Billie Holiday was, there's much writing about her voice, 
        cultural role, and so on. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So time catches up with the poetry! And 
        that's OK because, in the end, nothing substitutes for "close reading," 
        which needn't be arid New Critical exercise at all, but just the habit 
        of paying attention to the words and sentences on the page or on a CD-whatever. 
        I will sound like an Old Wolf in kvetch clothing when I say it's a practice 
        that has been largely lost. So afraid are teachers and their students 
        of actually looking at a text, so fearful that they will be endowing that 
        text with "autonomy," that crucial things get missed. I was dismayed the 
        other day in my graduate class when, in reading Stein's "Miss Furr and 
        Miss Skeene," three of the eighteen seminar members thought Helen Furr 
        was the same person as Mrs. Furr and that she had left her husband to 
        be with Georgine Skeene because she was stifled by bourgeois capitalism, 
        or some such thing. The seven-page story does refer to Helen not liking 
        to live "where she had always been living," which-common sense tells us-could 
        hardly have always been with her husband, could it? And on the next page 
        we read explicitly that Helen Furr went home to visit "her mother and 
        father." Accordingly, when you get this kind of reading, you know the 
        student hasn't actually read through the text. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching poetry thus remains a challenge. 
        And I can't think of a more perfect comment on all this than your words 
        in "What's Art Got To Do With It?": 
        <blockquote> The shortest distance between two points is a digression. 
          I hold for a wandering thought just that I may stumble upon something 
          worthy of report. </blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows, ahead of time, what those items 
        worthy of report, might be? <br>
        <br>
        <b>CB:</b> And that goes as much for criticism as poetry, where the value, 
        in part, comes from the searching for something not yet defined. Maybe 
        close reading would get a better rap if we called it <i>PSI: Poetry Scene 
        Investigation</i>. Of course, that would mean treating the poem as a crime, 
        but maybe it is: a crime against mass culture. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poetry is too important to be left to its 
        own devices," also means that poems can't do all the work of poetry by 
        themselves. For poems to come into being, we need editors, publishers, 
        designers, proofreaders, booksellers, web sites, teachers, critics, detractors, 
        supporters, and of course, not to leave them out of the picture entirely, 
        poets and readers. I think the phobia about explication comes from the 
        fact that some of what calls itself that is obtuse, dishearteningly literal 
        or thematic, in short, deadening. But bad teaching about poetry is a comparable 
        problem to bad writing of poetry; poetry as an art may seem to suffocate 
        under the blankets applied in a well-meaning effort to keep it warm (as 
        if the body of the text was growing as cold as a corpse), but poems go 
        their merry way irrespective and irregardless. Cut-'em up, mangle their 
        meanings, weigh them down with unsupportable symbolism, reduce them to 
        a sentiment, strip them to their empty cores ... and they still keep coming 
        back for more. Poems are remarkably resilient, and far less likely to 
        be injured by incursions into their autonomy or excursions into their 
        associations, than we have any reason to expect. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet if poems are uncannily resilient, poets, 
        alas, are not. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, there I go again, off on a tangent. 
        (How many tangents can play the harp on the edge of a pin? Or is it pine?) 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, I don't mean to suggest that criticism 
        is always, or even mostly, agonistic. Your own approach to close reading 
        is not as a contest between poem and reading, but as dance, the two in 
        tango. Moreover, without such external interventions, poetry would, indeed, 
        be a dead art. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The poem is not finished even when it 
        is completed</i>. Completion or publication marks not the end of the poem 
        but rather its entry into the world through the responses to it. And that's 
        another dimension of the sort of close reading you encourage; for the 
        poems we reread over time become cultural time capsules, linguistic dioramas 
        in which each phrase is an imaginary hyperlink for our further exploration 
        of - or reentry into - a particular time and place. In other words, crucial 
        to any sense of the cultural details in a poem is the world they constitute; 
        not only what the particulars are but also the economy of the particulars 
        - how they are distributed and arranged. That's the way poems lend themselves, 
        are made for, reinhabitation; why chasing down the references or the milieu 
        the references evoke doesn't detract from the poem but rather opens it 
        up. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspiration is not what comes before the 
        poet writes the poem but what happens when the poem is read (or heard). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A criticism is responsible to the degree 
        it is able to respond.</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criticism engages and extends the work 
        of the poem, but criticism is not the end of poetry. Nor is the poem the 
        final destination of a process of analysis and research. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poem is an initial point of embarkation 
        on journeys yet to come, on earth as they are in the imaginary space between 
        here and there, now and then, is and as. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, hey, if you have time now, let's go 
        together on a trip to those cake shops on the Nevsky.
