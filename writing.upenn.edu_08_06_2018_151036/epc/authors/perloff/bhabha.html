 <FONT FACE="times">Homi K. Bhabha's influential and widely disseminated
essay &quot;DissemiNation:  Time, narrative and the margins of
the modern nation&quot; is a powerful critique of what Bhabha
takes to be inadequate &quot;essentialist&quot; readings of nationhood--
readings that attempt to define and naturalize Third World &quot;nations&quot;
by means of the supposedly homogenous, holistic, and historically
continuous traditions that falsely define and ensure their subordinate
status.  Nations and cultures, he argues both here and throughout
<U>The Location of Culture</U>, must be understood as &quot;narrative&quot;
constructions that arise from the &quot;hybrid&quot; interaction
of contending national and cultural constituencies:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">It is in the emergence of the interstices-the
overlap and displacement of domains of difference-that the intersubjective
and collective experiences of <U>nationness</U>, community interest,
or cultural value are negotiated. . . . Terms of cultural engagement,
whether antagonistic or affiliative, are produced performatively.
 The representation of difference must not be hastily read as
the reflection of <U>pre-given</U> ethnic or cultural traits set
in the fixed tablet of tradition.  The social articulation of
difference, from the minority perspective, is a complex, on-going
negotiation that seeks to authorize cultural hybridities that
emerge in moments of historical transformation.  (LC 2)<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">The &quot;interstitial perspective,&quot;
as Bhabha calls it (LC 3), replaces &quot;the polarity of a prefigurative
self-generating nation 'in itself' and extrinsic other nations&quot;
with the notion of &quot;cultural liminality <U>within the nation</U></FONT>&quot;<FONT FACE="times">
(LC 148).  &quot;The liminal figure of the nation-space would
ensure that no political ideologies could claim transcendent or
metaphysical authority for themselves.  This is because the subject
of cultural discourse-the agency of a people-is split in the discursive
ambivalence that emerges in the contest of narrative authority
between the pedagogical and the performative&quot; (LC 148)-which
is to say, between the people's status as &quot;historical 'objects'
of a nationalist pedagogy,&quot; and their ability to perform
themselves as  &quot;'subjects' of a process of signification
that must erase any prior or originary [national] presence&quot;
(LC145).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times"> Hybridity, liminality, &quot;interrogatory,
interstitial space&quot; (LC 3)-these are the positive values
Bhabha opposes to a retrograde historicism that continues to dominate
Western critical thinking,  a &quot;linear narrative of the nation,&quot;
with its claims for the &quot;holism of culture and community&quot;
and a &quot;fixed horizontal nation-space&quot; (LC 142).   We
must, he argues eloquently, undo such thinking with its facile
binary oppositions.  Rather than emphasizing the opposition between
First World and Third World nations, between colonizer and colonized,
men and women, black and white, straight and gay, Bhabha would
have it, we might more profitably focus on the faultlines themselves,
on border situations and thresholds as the sites where identities
are performed and contested. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">In advancing this revisionist argument,  Bhabha
draws on an astonishing variety of theoretical, literary, and
art texts.  From A to Z (Althusser to Zizek), from Marx to Chantal
Mouffe to Toni Morrison:  citations from these &quot;authorities&quot;-some
of them artists, most of them political or cultural theorists
as well as philosophers-are woven together so as to constitute
what we might call an oratorical collage, in which argument tends
to be subordinated to exhortation.  Bhabha seems to be most comfortable
when he alludes to poststructuralist theory, especially to the
writings of Derrida and Lacan.  But, as someone trained as a literary
scholar (with a doctorate in English),  he also cites, throughout
<U>The Location of Culture</U>, novels and poems, photographs
and art installations that are germane to his argument.  It is
the treatment of the literary and the artistic vis-&agrave;-vis
what Bhabha calls the &quot;liminal site of modern society&quot;(LC
146) that I wish to consider here. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Let me begin with the passage, early in &quot;DissemiNation,&quot;
 in which Bhabha is questioning the &quot;progressive metaphor
of modern social cohesion-<U>the many as one</U></FONT>-<FONT FACE="times">shared
by organic theories of the holism of culture and community, and
by theorists who treat gender, class or race as social totalities
that are expressive of unitary collective experiences&quot; (LC142).
 His example of such cultural holism-of the &quot;founding dictum,&quot;
<U>E pluribus unum</U></FONT>-<FONT FACE="times">is Goethe's
classic travel book <U>Italienische </U>Reise (<U>Italian Journey</U>,
as that narrative is seen through the lens of Bakhtin's critical
analysis in his essay &quot;The <U>Bildungsroman and Its Significance
in the History of Realism</U>.&quot;  This essay, composed in
the late 1930s and published in English translation in <U>Speech
Genres &amp; Other Late Essays</U> (1986), edited by Caryl Emerson
and Michael Holquist, is, according to Holquist, actually a fragment
from one of Bakhtin's several lost books:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Its nonappearance resulted . . . from
effects that grew out of the Second World War. . . . Sovetsky
pistael (Soviet Writer), the publishing house that was to bring
out Bakhtin's book <U>The Novel of Education and Its Significance
in the History of Realism</U>, was blown up in the early months
of the German invasion, with the loss of the manuscript on which
he had worked for at least two years (1936-38).  Bakhtin retained
only certain preparatory materials and a prospectus of the book;
due to the paper shortage, he had torn them up page by page during
the war to make wrappers for his endless chain of cigarettes.
 He began smoking pages from the conclusion of the manuscript,
so what we have is a small portion of its opening section, primarily
about Goethe.  (MMB xiii)<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">I mention these awful circumstances because,
as we shall note below, it provides an interesting &quot;national&quot;
context for Bakhtin's own literary perspective.  In the essay
fragment we have, Bakhtin posits that Goethe had the &quot;startling
ability to see time in space&quot; and vice-versa, to &quot;visualize
time&quot; (MMB 30). For the ordinary observer, for example, &quot;Mountains
are the epitome of stasis, the embodiment of immobility and immutability&quot;
(MMB 29).  But in fact, so the Goethe of the <U>Italian Journey</U>
observes, they change internally, become active, and create weather;
their appearance contains their history.  Conversely, Bakhtin
shows, Goethe is only interested in history when it can be visualized,
when its imprint on nature and culture can be seen.  When it cannot,
a curious mental block sets in.  When, for example, in a mountain
valley south of Palermo,  the guide explains &quot;how, long ago,
Hannibal had given battle here and what stupendous feats of valour
had taken place on this very spot,&quot; Goethe irritatedly rejects
what he calls an &quot;odious evocation of defunct ghosts&quot;
(IJ 222), there being no trace, in the landscape before him, of
past acts of violence and war.  For the author of the <U>Italian
Journey</U>, Bakhtin shows with a wealth of detail,  &quot;the
<U>word</U> coincided with the clearest visibility. . . . .The
invisible did not exist for him. But at the same time his eyes
did not want to (and could not) see that which was <U>ready-made</U>
and <U>immobile</U>.  His eyes did not recognize simple spatial
contiguities or the simple coexistence of things and phenomena.
 Behind each static multiformity he saw multitemporality (MMB
28). This <U>chronotope</U></FONT>-<FONT FACE="times">Bakhtin's
famous term for the space-time unit in narrative, is at once representative
of a larger shift from Romanticism to Realism at Goethe's moment
but also, as Bakhtin makes clear, curiously idiosyncratic. Goethe's
meteorological theories, for example, were often quite wrong even
though they gave him a wealth of metaphors for poetry.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times"> One of Bakhtin's examples of Goethe's visualization
of time is the following passage from the <U>Italian Journey</U>:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">In a country where everyone enjoys
the day but the evening even more, sunset is an important moment.
 All work stops; those who were strolling about return to their
homes; the father wants to see his daughter back in the house-the
day has ended.  We Cimmerians hardly know the real meaning of
day.  With our perpetual fogs and cloudy skies we do not care
if it is day or night, since we are so little given to take walks
and enjoy ourselves out of doors.  But here, when night falls,
the day consisting of evening and morning is definitely over.
. . . The bells ring, the rosary is said, the maid enters the
room with a lighted lamp and says: &quot;<U>Felicissima notte</U>!&quot;
 This period of time varies in length according to the season,
and people who live here are so full of vitality that this does
not confuse them, because the pleasures of their existence are
related not to the precise hour, but to the time of day.  If one
were to force a German clock hand on them, they would be at a
loss. . . .  (IJ 42; MMB 31)<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">And Goethe appends a sketch in which he uses
concentric circles to give a visually graphic image of the relationship
between Italian time and its German counterpart</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">.
  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><FONT FACE="times">Bhabha,
who cites this passage in &quot;DissemiNation,&quot; seems to
take this relationship quite literally.  &quot;Goethe's realist
narrative,&quot; he claims, &quot;produces a national-historical
time that makes visible a specifically Italian day in the detail
of its passing time.  &quot;The recurrent metaphor,&quot; he surmises,
is &quot;of <U>landscape as the inscape of national identity</U></FONT>&quot;<FONT FACE="times">;
the passage illustrates &quot;the power of the eye to naturalize
the rhetoric of <U>national affiliation</U> and its forms of collective
expression&quot; (LC 143, my italics).  And Bhabha calls this
&quot;a national <U>vision of emergence</U>.&quot;   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">As such, Goethe's narrative is an example
of a false holism.  &quot;Can this national time-space,&quot;
Bhabha asks, &quot;be as fixed or as immediately visible as Bakhtin
claims?&quot; (LC143).   &quot;Can we accept Bakhtin's repeated
attempt to read the national space as achieved only in the fullness
of time&quot; (LC 144)?  And he concludes: &quot;We are led to
ask whether the <U>emergence</U> of a national perspective-of
an &eacute;lite or subaltern nature-within a culture of social
contestation, can ever articulate its 'representative' authority
in that fullness of narrative time and visual synchrony of the
sign that Bakhtin proposes&quot; (LC144).  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Bhabha does make the qualification that the
&quot;fullness of time&quot; in <U>Italian Journey</U> is not
achieved without a &quot;narrative struggle.&quot;   &quot;From
the beginning . . . ,&quot; he remarks,  &quot;the Realist and
Romantic conceptions of time coexist in Goethe's work, but the
ghostly (<U>Gespensterm&auml;ssiges)</U>, the terrifying (<U>Unerfreuliches)</U>,
and the unaccountable (<U>Unzuberechnendes</U>) are consistently
surmounted by the structuring process of the visualization of
time&quot; (LC143).  Given this willed suppression of what Freud
was to call the uncanny (<U>da&szlig; Unheimliche</U>), the <U>Italian
Journey</U>, or at least Bakhtin's reading of it, is compared
unfavorably to later &quot;accounts of the emergence of national
narratives&quot;-John Barrell's &quot;splendid analysis of the
rhetorical and perspectivel status of the 'English gentleman'
within the social diversity of the eighteenth-century novel; and
. . . Houston Baker's innovative reading of the 'new <U>national</U>
modes of sounding, interpreting and speaking the Negro in the
Harlem Renaissance'.&quot;  A triumph, it seems, of contemporary
theory over the merely literary text (Goethe's) as well as its
mere critical elucidation (Bakhtin's).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Does the fact that Bakhtin's fragmentary text
was written in the 1930s, Barrell's and Baker's fifty years later
in the eighties (1983 and 1987 respectively) make any difference?
 Chronology-or, for that matter-history in general--seem to be
of little interest to Bhabha, as is evident from his repeated
assumption that the &quot;fullness of narrative time and visual
synchrony of the sign&quot; are somehow equivalent to nationhood.
Neither in the <U>Bildungsroman</U> fragment nor in related essays
is <U>nation</U> a critical category; on the contrary, as a self-designated
&quot;philosophical anthropologist,&quot; Bakhtin looked for categories
that transcend specific nation and culture: he moves easily across
space and time from Goethe to Rabelais to Dostoievsky.   Perhaps
this was the case because, as an exile, if not to say prisoner,
 in his own nation, the Soviet Union, throughout his precarious
and tragic life,  questions of nationhood or ethnicity naturally
took the back-seat to larger issues of speech patterning and literary
structure, to narrative mode and generic choice.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">As for Goethe, it is helpful to remember that
the <U>Italienische Reise</U> was written between 1786-88, almost
a hundred years before Italy actually <U>was</U> a unified nation.
 In the pre-Napoleonic, pre-nationalist culture within which Goethe
operated, neither what Bhabha calls the pedagogical imperative--the
people's status as &quot;historical 'objects' of a nationalist
pedagogy- nor the performative--the people's ability to perform
themselves as  &quot;'subjects' of a process of signification
that must erase any prior or originary [national] presence&quot;
(LC145)- would seem to be especially relevant.   In the context
of Goethe's narrative, the comparison of &quot;German&quot; to
&quot;Italian weather&quot; cited above is little more than a
comparison of Northern  and Southern life styles, a comparison
of a locale in which the greyness of daylight gradually modulates
in the black of night with one where the bright day suddenly ends
when the sun sets.  The commentary might apply to Boston and Barcelona
as easily as to &quot;the German&quot; and the &quot;Italian,&quot;
although Goethe's weather and time maps would then have to be
adjusted.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Indeed an actual reading of the <U>Italian
Journey</U> would have shown Bhabha that this particular travel
book, far from treating everyday life in Italy as a &quot;progressive
metaphor of modern social cohesion&quot; (LC 142), is fixated
on difference, otherness, and transformation-the very hybridity
he takes it to deny.   Goethe's visually-minded narrator is aware
of every new flower, every rock formation, the course of every
mountain stream.  &quot;Having taken this journey in order to
escape the inclemencies I had suffered on the fifty-first parallel,&quot;
he writes of the passage through the Tyrolean Alps, &quot;I had
hoped, I must confess, to enter a true Goshen on the forty-eighth.
 I found myself disappointed, as I should have known beforehand,
because latitude by itself does not make a climate but mountain
ranges do, especially those which cross countries from east to
west&quot; (IJ 14).   And a few days later from Bolzano, &quot;Can
I learn to look at things with clear, fresh eyes? . . . . Can
the grooves of old mental habits be effaced?  This is what I am
trying to discover.  The fact that I have to look after myself
keeps me mentally alert all the time and I find that I am developing
a new elasticity of mind&quot; (IJ 21).  Arriving in Roverto en
route to Verona, he notes that here &quot;the language changes
abruptly.  North of this point it had wavered between German and
Italian.  Now, for the first time I had a pure-bred Italian as
a postilion.  The innkeeper speaks no German and I must put my
linguistic talents to the test&quot;  (24).  And soon, on the
shores of Lake Garda, he finds himself (latitude 45 degrees and
50 minutes) in &quot;a totally unfamiliar environment&quot; (IJ
25):</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">The people lead the careless life of
a fool's paradise.  To begin with, the doors have no locks, though
the innkeeper assures me that I would not have to worry if all
my belongings were made of diamonds.  Then the windows are closed
with oil paper instead of glass.  Finally, a highly necessary
convenience is lacking, so that one is almost reduced to a state
of nature.  When I asked the servant for a certain place, he pointed
down into the courtyard.  &quot;<U>Qui abasso pu&ograve; servirsi!</U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">
 &quot;<U>Dove</U>?&quot; I asked.  &quot;<U>Da per tutto, dove
vuol!</U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">
was his friendly answer&quot; (IJ 25).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">A definitive difference between nations? 
Rather, a difference between the rural and the urban, where bathroom
arrangements will be quite different.  Goethe's main thrust is
to differentiate Venice from Florence, Florence from Rome, and
later from Naples and Palermo.  Florence, for example, is a town
that doesn't speak to Goethe and which he passes through quickly,
the art and culture of the Quattrocento being quite unfamiliar
to him.  Rome, by contrast, is, for Goethe, as Bakhtin says, the
&quot;great chronotope of human history&quot; (MMB 40), in that
it bears witness to the complex strata of its past:</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Here is an entity which has suffered
so many drastic changes in the course of two thousand years, yet
it is still the same soil, the same hill, often even the same
column or the same wall, and in its people one still finds traces
of their ancient character.  Contemplating this, the observer
becomes, as it were, a contemporary of the great decrees of destiny,
and this makes it difficult for him to follow the evolution of
the city, to grasp not only how Modern Rome follows Ancient, but
also how, within both, one epoch follows another (IJ 120).  </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">This is an instance of what Bakhtin calls
the  &quot;fullness and clarity of the visibility of the time
in space.&quot;  But the charms of <U>Einf&uuml;hlung</U> don't
always work:  sometimes, as I remarked earlier, the visible remains
impenetrable.  Consider the following entry from Ferrara dated
October 16, 1786:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">For the first time on my trip I am
in low spirits and feel utterly indifferent to this beautiful,
depopulated city in the middle of a flat plain.  Once upon a time
these same streets were animated by a brilliant court.  Here Ariosto
lived disappointed and Tasso unhappy, and we persuade ourselves
that we are edified by visiting their shrines.   The mausoleum
of Ariosto contains a great deal of badly distributed marble.
 Instead of Tasso's prison we are shown a woodshed or coal cellar
in which he was certainly not confined.  At first nobody in the
house knows what one wants to see.  After a while they remember,
but not before they have been tipped.  I was reminded of Dr. Luther's
famous ink stain which is touched up from time to time by the
custodian of the castle.  There must be something of an itinerant
journeyman about most travellers to make them want to look for
such signs.  (IJ 91-92).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">The absence of connection here recalls the
Hannibal-in-Sicily passage I cited earlier.  And there are many
such disconnects-moments when the spatial and temporal fail to
intersect producing the psychic pain Bakhtin refers to in his
discussion of &quot;the ghostly (<U>Gespenterm&auml;ssiges)</U>,
the terrifying (<U>Unerfreuliches</U>), and the unaccountable
(<U>Unzuberechnendes</U>), which were strong in his initial feeling
of a merged past and present&quot; (MMB 36).  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times"> Bhabha, who wants to see this &quot;narrative
struggle&quot; as the &quot;repression of a 'cultural' unconscious;
a liminal, uncertain state of cultural belief when the archaic
emerges in the midst of margins of modernity&quot; (LC 143), makes
a curious clinamen that somewhat gives his game away.  Bakhtin,
let us note, talks about the ghostly, the terrifying, and the
unaccountable as elements of Goethe's &quot;initial,&quot; that
is, youthful failure of assimilating the past, the reference being
to the psychological difficulties of the poet's postgraduate days,
as recounted by the late Goethe in his autobiography, <U>Dichtung
und Wahrheit</U> (see MMB 35).  It is there, not in the <U>Italian
Journey</U>, that Goethe uses the three German nouns quoted above.
 Bhabha who follows Bakhtin in citing the original German is merely
copying his source.  We know this because Bakhtin has curiously
and quite uncharacteristically made a mistake that Bhabha repeats.
 Two of the nouns are correctly translated, but <U>Unerfreuliches</U>
is quite wrongly translated as &quot;the terrifying.&quot;  The
adjective <U>Unerfreulich</U> from which the noun is formed is
a fairly mild epithet; it means &quot;unpleasant,&quot; &quot;displeasing,&quot;
&quot;tiresome,&quot; &quot;unsatisfactory.&quot;  The sentence
&quot;Da&szlig; ist Unerfreulich&quot; is rather like saying,
&quot;That's not good news.&quot;  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">But why does Bhabha cite the German to begin
with? The reversion to the <U>original</U> is a practice he may
have derived from Derrida and Lacan exegetes, who regularly cite
the foreign word (e.g., <U>graphein</U>, <U>differance</U>, <U>pharmakos</U>,
<U>jouissance</U>, <U>imaginaire)</U> in parentheses so as to
indicate that (1) they have direct access to the original, and
(2) that the word in question is untranslatable and hence must
be referred to in its original or &quot;true&quot; state.   But
since Bhabha is not concerned, as is, say, Gayatri Spivak in her
Introduction to <U>Grammatology</U>, with teasing out the etymologies
and semantic values of a given author's more difficult terms,
his practice here and elsewhere in <U>The Location of Culture</U>
serves no function except to guarantee some sort of authenticity
to the original --an odd phenomenon, given Bhabha's declared distrust
of the authentic, the organic, the true.    </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">The gesture toward origins, in any case, remains
suspended, for the <U>Italian Journey</U> functions for Bhabha
only as example, as illustration for the larger theoretical and
ideological statements the cultural critic wishes to make.  The
citation of examples, preferably cited in their original language
or from an original source and reproduced from an original manuscript,
is, of course, a legacy of the New Historicism.  But whereas a
critic like Stephen Greenblatt gives the literary text, culturally
constructed or not, equal time with the non-literary texts under
consideration, the more recent &quot;Cultural Studies&quot; trend,
exemplified by <U>The Location of Culture</U>, is to reduce the
primary text to mere counter or commodity.  Thus Goethe's <U>Italian
Journey</U> is read as conveying a particular message-<U>E pluribus
unum</U></FONT>-<FONT FACE="times">even though it deals with
the confrontation of a &quot;strange&quot; and alien culture on
the part of an extraordinary late eighteenth-century European
poet, a poet who is also a novelist, dramatist, and autobiographer
as well as a more-than-amateur chemist, geologist, meteorologist,
and botanist.  Whereas Bhabha's cultural model is characterized
by its hybridities and liminalities -- the nation, we are told
again and again, is an arena of contestation and rival performativities--the
artwork has, evidently, no more than instrumental value, illustrating
and exemplifying the political and ideological thesis of the critic
who happens to find it of use.  </FONT>
<P>
 <FONT FACE="times">The same thing is likely to occur-and I turn
now a quite different example -- when Bhabha deals with contemporary
art works.  In the Introduction to <U>The Location of Culture</U>,
Bhabha talks of &quot;the borderline work of culture&quot; as
one that &quot;demands an encounter with 'newness' that is not
part of the continuum of past and present,&quot; one that &quot;creates
a sense of the new as an insurgent act of cultural translation&quot;
(LC 7).  &quot;Such art,&quot; he suggests, &quot;renews the past,
refiguring it as a contingent 'in-between' space, that innovates
and interrupts the performance of the present&quot; (LC 7).  A
primary instance is the work of Los Angeles photographer Allan
Sekula:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">. . . it is in the photographic art
of Alan [<U>sic</U>] Sekula that takes the borderline condition
of cultural translation to its global limit in <U>Fish Story</U>,
his photographic project on harbours: 'the harbor is the site
in which material goods appear in bulk, in the very flux of exchange.'
 The harbour and the stockmarket become the <U>paysage moralis&eacute;</U>
of a containerized, computerized world of global trade.  Yet,
the non-synchronous time-space of transnational 'exchange', and
exploitation, is embodied in a navigational allegory.&quot;  (LC
8)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">And Bhabba cites Sekula's own comment in the
Preface to <U>Fish Story</U>:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Things are more confused now.  A scratchy
recording of the Norwegian national anthem blares out from a loudspeaker
at the Sailor's Home on the bluff above the channel.  The container
ship being greeted flies a Bahamian flag of convenience.  It was
built by Koreans working long hours in the giant shipyards of
Ulsan.  The underpaid and the understaffed crew could be Salvadorean
or Filipino.  Only the Captain hears a familiar melody.  </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Bhabha seems to take this as a confirmation
of his own program for the &quot;articulation of cultural differences
. . .that initiate . . . innovative sites of collaboration, and
contestation&quot; (LC 1-2).  As he explains it: &quot;Norway's
nationalist nostalgia cannot drown out the babel on the bluff.
 Transnational capitalism and the impoverishment of the Third
World certainly create the chains of circumstance that incarcerate
the Salvadorean or the Filipino/a.  In their cultural passage,
hither and thither, as migrant workers, part of the massive economic
and political diaspora of the modern world, they embody the Benjaminian
'present': that moment blasted out of the continuum of history&quot;
(LC 8).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times"> But does <U>Fish Story</U> in fact embody
this &quot;babel on the bluff&quot;?  Sekula's 1995 traveling
exhibition, reproduced in book form by October (MIT) Books, with
its sequence of hundreds of color photographs, slide sequences,
and text panels that comment on the project, ironizes not only
the picturesque harbor scenes that are a staple of Impressionist
and modernist painting, but also those dramatic pictures of oil
spills, boat people, and burning aircraft carriers that flood
the media.  By contrast, in <U>Fish Story</U> nothing is &quot;readily
visible,&quot; to use Bakhtin's term.  The sequential photographic
frames display, by means of bright colors and their seemingly
&quot;objective&quot; view of ships' interior, longshoremen, and
other struggling workers [figures 1 &amp; 2], a shipping industry
that has been stripped of the colorful role it once played in
cultural life.  As the curator for the Witte de With exhibition
in Rotterdam, put it:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Former harbors have been transformed
into palatial residential districts, while far beyond the horizon
line of the city and out of view of its inhabitants, barren and
inhospitable terrains have risen where cargoes packed into huge,
standardized containers are loaded and unloaded by automatic means.
 The very identity of the world of shipping has been obscured
through the forces of industrialization and a concomitant increase
in magnitude; its traditionally close ties with the population
have been undermined. . . . labor conditions are deteriorating,
jobs are becoming scarce and those who are employed have to work
harder and harder just to keep their heads above water.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Geneva">
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Sekula's is a straightforwardly Marxist interpretation
of the damage global capitalism has inflicted on the workers-in
this case, sailors, dock workers, and longshoremen-- of the world.
 As such, it ironically reproduces the very discourse of class
and ethnicity Bhabha has been at such pains to oppose.  <U>Fish
Story</U> posits the classic Marxist binary between rich and poor,
capitalist and worker, colonizer and colonized.  The fact that
a given ship from the Bahamas was built by Koreans, has a crew
made up of Salvadoreans and Filipinos, even as its captain is
Norwegian,  is not, I would argue, a sign of the hybridity or
the liminality of the waterfront system.  On the contrary, the
captain is First World, the crew from the Third, the Captain is
white, crew and work force, people of color, and so on.  The order
of this world is one of extreme stratification.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times"> A sequel to <U>Fish Story</U> called <U>Freeway
to China</U> has recently been exhibited at the Getty Center for
the Humanities,where I have had  the good fortune to see it. 
These new consecutive-frame images of the Los Angeles port at
San Pedro &quot;are immediately readable,&quot; according to the
exhibition's curator Moira Kenney, &quot;as a coherent sociological
exploration of the port's political and economic realities, although
the narrative emphasizes its distinctions and disruptions.  At
the center of the group, formalistic images of cranes, ships,
and piers under construction (see figure 3) suggest the vitality
of the expanding economy&quot;; but, Kenney adds:</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Against this backdrop, images of Russian,
German and American workers complicate this expansionist argument.
. . . Working on a Belgian ship sailing from Abu Dhabi with cranes
built by Filipino laborers, the Russians represent a new migrant
workforce, disenfranchised by the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 An even stronger irony is suggested in the portrait of Mason
Davis [see figure 3], an African American welder who represents
the local labor pool that has worked only sporadically since the
recent federal cuts in defense spending. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">This artful photographic discourse, defining,
as it does, &quot;the growing inequity of a multinational economic
transformation that has not trickled into lived Los Angeles&quot;
(Kenney) present us with stark and often powerful images, reminiscent
in their bright red and black posters of the late Rodchenko, but
here the bright colors and idealized figures are parodic, pinpointing
as they do the bleak life of the actual workers --welders, machinists,
shop stewards-- dwarfed by the girders, cranes, and other varieties
of huge and strangely beautiful machinery-machinery that hardly
needs their participation.  The message about the destruction
of the social fabric on the part of global capital is clear enough,
but it is a message that seems curiously at odds with Bhabha's
own liminality model.   True, the San Pedro labor pool may include
poor black locals and Filipino migrant workers as well as recent
Russian immigrants, but in Secula's poster-like photographs, they
wear the same uniform and hence look very much alike [figure 4].
 Indeed, if Sekula's accompanying text did not tell us about their
differences,  we would be hard put to read these photos as staging
what Bhabha describes as &quot;the 'right' to signify from the
periphery of authorized power and privilege&quot; (LC 2).  Contestation,
performativity, border discourse--these are notably missing in
the photos themselves.</FONT>
<P>
 <FONT FACE="times">Why, then, does Bhabha use Sekula's art work
as illustrative material?  Perhaps because, in his eagerness to
find supporting evidence for what is, after all, a theoretical
rather than an empirical construct, Bhabha judges the art work
by its captions and accompanying didactic panels rather than by
anything that is actually <U>there</U>.  Perhaps Sekula struck
him as a kindred spirit-a fellow-Contributing Editor to <U>October</U>,
a fellow professor (Sekula, a white, Jewish Californian, teaches
the Visual Arts at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia
and composed <U>Freeway to China</U> during his tenure as Senior
Scholar at the Getty)-and he evidently admired the artist's <U>mise
en question</U> of the grand narrative of pre-Industrial culture,
the &quot;Fish Story&quot; of European maritime progress.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">That this narrative is itself romantic, that
it reinscribes, moreover, the very binary opposition of past and
present, tradition and modernity, oppressor and oppressed that
Bhabha has been at such pains to contest (see LC 35), is curiously
elided in the critic's drive to establish his theoretical credentials
and parameters and hence to let the art and literary chips fall
where they may.  Indeed, the secondariness of the art construct
vis-&agrave;-vis the critic's theoretical discourse affects even
the discussion of a novel Bhabha does seem to have read-Toni Morrison's
<U>Beloved</U>.   In the Introduction to <U>The Location of Culture</U>,
he discusses the role of Beloved herself in Morrison's novel and
produces the following hyperbolic catechistic sequence:</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
 <FONT SIZE=2> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"><DD>Who is Beloved?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Now we understand:  she is the daughter
that returns to Sethe so that her mind will be homeless no more.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"><DD>Who is Beloved?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Now we may say: she is the sister that
returns to Denver, and brings hope of her father's return, the
fugitive who died in his escape.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva"><DD> Who is Beloved?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Geneva">Now we know:  she is the daughter made
of murderous love who returns to love and hate and free herself.
 Her words are broken, like the lynched people with broken necks;
disembodied like the dead children who lost their ribbons.  But
there is no mistaking what her words say as they rise from the
dead despite their lost syntax and their fragmented presence.
 (LC 17)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Now we understand, now we may say, now we
know.  What is a novel that it can so readily and melodramatically
be explained away?  More important for our purposes here:  what
is the marginal, the liminal, the interstitial, if the &quot;affirmative&quot;
message that &quot;the slave mother regain[s] through the presence
of the child, the property of her own person&quot; (LC 17) can
be stated thus baldly?  And third-and here I turn in conclusion
from literary meaning to literary history, that other large area
occluded by the cultural-theory paradigm before us-how does the
generic slave narrative cum ghost story of the late 1980s, produced
by a middle-class urban, college-educated African-American novelist,
compare with actual slave narrative?  And what about the modes
of production and reception of <U>Beloved</U>?  How do  bestsellerdom
and the Nobel Prize relate to marginality and hybridity?  At what
border, in other words, did Toni Morrison struggle as she composed,
with the help of many fellowships and grants, a novel &quot;about&quot;
the impact of slavery for those who have experienced it?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times"> These, I suspect, are not questions that
would interest Homi Bhabha, his being more manifesto than reasoned
argument, more <U>pathos</U> than <U>dianoia</U>.  Perhaps it
is the epideictic mode, the ceremonial oratory of display, that
has won Bhabha such enthusiastic readers and prevented us from
asking too many hard questions.  In the meantime, his liminality
model is not without some astonishing ironies.  Think, for example,
of Bakhtin, writing from those very interstices of society (and,
for that matter, of Western Europe) that Bhabha finds so appealing,
a Bakhtin who was powerless, marginalized, and thus unable to
invent himself as a &quot;performative subject&quot; or to contest
the various dominant discourses of Stalinist Russia.   Bakhtin,
whose exile, subalternity, and suppression, his resort to writing
paper for the making of cigarette wrappers, does not prevent him
from being seen, in &quot;DissemiNation,&quot; as one of the purveyors
of the &quot;plenitudinous present and eternal visibility of a
past&quot; (LC151). But then, in Bahbha's scheme of things, the
moment of writing is not germane to the larger argument, any more
than it matters that the word <U>Italian</U>, in Goethe's day,
could hardly refer to a nation-state, there being no unified Italy,
only a loose assemblage of geographically and linguistically related
city-states and provinces.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times"> We must not overstate the case.  In its general
outlines, Bhabha's hybridity paradigm has enormous appeal:  we
want to believe, after all, that the postcolonial location is
one where the binary opposition of oppressor and oppressed, male
and female, master and victim, has become irrelevant, that the
new playing field is one of performative contestation rather than
ethnic or national separation and rivalry.  But the commodification
of literature and art-the treatment of complex novels, poems,
and art works as so much illustrative material for the &quot;larger&quot;
goal of making profound ethical and epistemological generalizations,
may well destroy the paradigm from within.  For long after Bhabha's
&quot;DissemiNation&quot; has disappeared from the library shelves,
long after even Bakhtin's brilliant analyses of chronotopes and
dialogism have been qualified by newer theoretical and critical
models, Goethe's <U>Italian Journey</U> will still be read, even
as it has already been read for more than two hundred years. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="times">Perhaps, then, instead of doing a Bhabhian
reading of Goethe we might do a Goethean reading of Bhabha.  Why,
for example, does this widely travelled critic (&quot;DissemiNation,&quot;
we read in the dedication to Paul Moritz Strimpel, bears the imprint
of Pforzheim - Paris - Zurich - Ahmedabad- Bombay- Milan-Lugano&quot;),
 have nothing to say about urban geography or about the relation
of city to the natural environment?  Why no rivers and mountains
in Bhahba's essays, no references to latitude or longitude?  
When did weather cease to play a part in constructing human consciousness,
and why?  Goethe, I suspect, would have interesting things to
say on these and similar questions.<BR>

the title are intentional, but a funny thing has happened to Bhabha's

the neuter demonstrative pronoun-<U>Da&szlig;</U>-demands the
