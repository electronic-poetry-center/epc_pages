<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>Language became a neurosis.  I used three of the basic world languages
in conversation, in poetry and in my newspaper work.  I was never
able to decide which of them I preferred.  An almost inextricable
chaos ensued, and sometimes I sought a facile escape by intermingling
all three.  I dreamed a new language, a super-tongue for intercontinental
expression, but it did not solve my problem.  I felt that the
great Atlantic community to which I belonged demanded an Atlantic
language.  Yet I was alone, quite alone, and I found no understanding
comrades who might have helped me in my linguistic jungle.
<P>
-- Eugene Jolas,  <U>Man from Babel<BR></SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P>
Language as neurosis or language as 'super-tongue for intercontinental
expression'?   For Eugene Jolas, a self-described 'American in
exile in the hybrid world of the Franco-German frontier, in a
transitional region where people swayed to and from in cultural
and political oscillation, in the twilight zone of the German
and French languages' (MB 5), language was clearly both.    For
his was not just the usual bilingualism (or, more properly, the
linguistic divisionism) of the Alsace-Lorraine citizen at the
turn of the century; it was compounded by the acquisition of American
English (already, so to speak, Jolas's birthright, born as he
was in Union, New Jersey) in the years between 1909 when, as a
fifteen-year old, he emigrated to New York, and 1923 when he returned
to Europe.    What Jolas called 'the long pilgrimage . . . through
the empires of three languages' (MB 65) was in many ways a great
gift, the entr&eacute;e to an international (or at least  pan-European
and North American) aesthetic.  But it was also, as we shall see,
a problem for a young man who aspired to be a great poet.   When,
in the early twenties, Jolas sent some of his poems to Frank Harris's
magazine, <U>Pearson's</U>, the latter cautioned Jolas that he
'came to English too late to become a real poet in [the English]
language'.   'There is, in fact', Harris remarked, 'no example
in history of a poet who abandoned his native language in adolescence,
and later succeeded in penetrating the mysteries of a new one.
 There are so many grammatical pitfalls that can never be overcome,
unless the words have been felt in childhood' (MB 49).
<P>
I shall come back to the poetry conundrum later, but, for the
moment, let us consider what trilingualism did for Jolas the editor
of <U>transition</U>, Jolas the impresario of the avant-garde,
and promoter of what he liked to call a 'Eur-American philology'
(MB 65).  From the first, Jolas's gift was an enormous sensitivity
to different linguistic registers.  Drafted in the U.S. army in
1917, he concentrated neither on military strategy nor on political
issues but on the 'new words' that he heard from his fellow soldiers,
most of them, like himself, recent immigrants: 'profane words,
crude words, voluptuous words, occult words, concrete words .
. . a scintillating assemblage of phonetic novelties' (MB 35).
'I heard', he recalls, 'the vocabulary of the bunkhouse, the steamer,
the construction camp, the brothel, the machine shop, the steel
mill.  I heard that lexicon of the farmhouse and the mountain
cabin. . . .  Here was truly a melting-pot, Franco-Belgian-Serbian-German-Austrian-Bohemian-Americans
in our outfit mingled with native-born Americans with Anglo-Saxon
names, and our conversations were often filled with picturesquely
distorted English and foreign words that quickened my Babel fantasies'
(MB 35).
<P>
To put these remarks in context, consider the admonition, made
not so many years earlier, by Henry James in a commencement speech
at Bryn Mawr College.  The new immigrants, James warned the graduates,
were destroying the 'ancestral circle' of the American language,
turning it into 'a mere helpless slobber of disconnected vowel
noises', an 'easy and ignoble minimum',  barely distinguishable
from 'the grunting, the squealing, the barking, or the roaring
of animals'.  'The forces of looseness', James warned, 'are in
possession of the field', and they 'dump their mountain of promiscuous
material into the foundations' of the language itself.  
<P>
From James's perspective, Jolas would be part of the 'force of
looseness . .. in possession of the field'.  But in the aftermath
of the Great War, with the increasing traffic between Americans
and Europeans (Marcel Duchamp, Fran&ccedil;ois Picabia, and Mina
Loy in the U.S.; Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes and a host of American
expatriates in Paris), the intactness of American English was
threatened, and the stage set for Jolas's own linguistic experiments
and for  his reception of Joyce's <U>Work in Progress</U>.   When,
in late 1926, he heard Joyce read from the opening pages of his
new manuscript, Jolas marveled at the 'polysynthetic quality'
of Joyce's language (MB 89), a language which was to become the
touchstone for <U>transition</U>.  The 'repetitiveness of Gertrude
Stein's writings' (MB 89-90), on the other hand,  was not really
Jolas's cup of tea, even though, in deference to his co-editor
Elliot Paul and to Stein's stature as the '<U>doyenne</U> among
American writers in Paris' (MB 116), he was to publish so many
of her experimental pieces, and even though he frequently came
to her defense in the pages of <U>transition</U> as well as in
the Notes to his <U>Anthologie de la nouvelle po&eacute;sie am&eacute;ricaine</U>
(1928).  In his autobiography, Jolas was more candid about what
he called Stein's 'esoteric stammering':
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Her mental attitude was remote from anything I felt and thought.
 For not only did she seem to be quite devoid of metaphysical
awareness but I also found her aesthetic approach both gratuitous
and lacking in substance. . . . 
<P>
We published a number of her compositions in <U>transition</U>,
although I am obliged to say that I saw, and see today, little
inventiveness in her writing.  The &quot;little household words&quot;
so dear to Sherwood Anderson, never impressed me, for my tendency
was always in the other direction.   I <U>wanted an enrichment
of language</U>, new words, millions of words. . . .  (MB 116,
my emphasis)<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
More vocabulary rather than less, Joycean 'enrichment' rather
than Steinian reduction: this  'other direction' was, of course,
Jolas's own.  The famous manifesto 'Revolution of the Word', which
appeared in the summer double issue of 1929 (T16-17), declared,
'The literary creator has the right to disintegrate the primal
matter of words imposed on him by text-books and dictionaries'
(#6), and 'He has the right to use words of his own fashioning
and to disregard existing grammatical and syntactical laws' (#7).
  In what Jolas understood to be the watershed year of the Great
Crash, T. S. Eliot, as the February '29 issue (T14) had declared,
was the enemy, his 'reformatory forces' having been 'constrain[ed]'
'into the straightjacket of political and religious dogma' (11).
   Fascism on the Right, Communism on the Left, a weak 'desiccated
humanitarianism' in the U.S.: all these,  Jolas felt, conspired
against the 'new art' and made revolution 'imperative'.  'The
new vocabulary and the new syntax must help destroy the ideology
of a rotting civilization' (15).
<P>
 But how exactly could the 'disregard' of 'existing  grammatical
and syntactical laws' contribute to the making of revolution?
 In Jolas's scheme of things, multilingualism was equivalent to
racial and ethnic equality.  In a piece called 'Logos' (T 16-17),
he addresses the issue of language borrowing and deformation:
'In modern history we have the example of the deformations which
English, French and Spanish words underwent in America , as in
the case of Creole French on Mauritius, Guyana, Martinique, Hayti
[<U>sic</U>], Louisiana, and Colonial Spanish' (p. 28).  When
he returned to New York in 1933, Jolas wandered the streets, recording
the 'inter-racial philology', the 'fantasia of many-tongued words'
(MB 147), accelerated by the presence of the new refugees from
Hitler.  He called the 'embryonic language of the future' the
'Atlantic, or Crucible, language, for it was the result of the
interracial synthesis that was going on in the United States,
Latin America and Canada.  It was American English, with an Anglo-Saxon
basis, plus many grammatical and lexical additions from more than
a hundred tongues.  All these, together with the Indian 'subsoil'
languages, are now being spoken in America' (MB 147).  And after
World War II, Jolas reconceived 'Atlantica' as a universal language
that 'might bridge the continents and neutralize the curse of
Babel', not by being an invention like Esperanto or Interglossa'
(MB 272), but by absorbing Anglo-Saxon, Greco-Latin, Celtic, Indian,
Spanish, French Canadian French, German, Pennsylvania German,
Dutch, Hebrew, the Slavic and Slavonic languages' (MB 273).  
<P>
Ironically enough, this Utopian dream of a common language had
as its primary exhibit the most esoteric (and arguably private)
of literary compositions: Joyce's <U>Finnegans Wake</U>, each
issue of <U>transition</U> presenting another installment of <U>Work
in Progress</U>, as it was then called.   Joyce's 'excellent knowledge
of French, German, Greek and Italian', wrote Jolas, 'stood him
in good stead, and he was constantly adding to his stock of linguistic
information by studying Hebrew, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Finnish
and other tongues.  At the basis of his vocabulary was also an
immense command of Anglo-Irish words that only seem like neologisms
to us today, because they have for the most part become obsolete'
(MB 167).     
<P>
A comparable enthusiasm for Joyce's linguistic virtuosity was
voiced by the young Samuel Beckett, whose essay 'Dante . . . Bruno
. Vico . . Joyce', appeared in the Summer 1929 issue of <U>Transition</U>
along with 'Revolution of the Word':  
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Here form <U>is</U> content, content <U>is</U> form.  You complain
that this stuff is not written in English.  It is not written
at all.  It is not to be read-or rather it is not only to be read.
 It is to be looked at and listened to.  His writing is not <U>about
</U>something<U>;</U>  <U>it is that something itself</U>. . .
.  When the sense is dancing, the words dance.  The language is
drunk.  The very words are tilted and effervescent.
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
And again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Joyce has desophisticated language. . . . It is abstracted
to death.  Take the word 'doubt':  it gives us hardly any sensuous
suggestion of hesitancy, of the necessity for choice, of static
irresolution.  Whereas the German 'Zweifel' does, and, in lesser
degree, the Italian 'dubitare'.  Mr. Joyce recognizes how inadequate
'doubt' is to express a state of extreme uncertainty, and replaces
it by 'intwosome twiminds'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Beckett's own early poems and stories reflect this interest in
polylingualism.  In 'Sedendo et Quiesciendo', which appeared in
the March 1932 issue of <U>transition</U> (#21), we read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Well really you know and in spite of the haricot skull and a tendency
to use up any odds and ends of pigment that might possibly be
left over she was the living spit he thought of Madonna Lucrezia
del Fede.  Ne suis-je point p&acirc;le?  Suis-je belle?  Certainly
pale and belle my pale belle Braut with a winter skin like an
old sail in the wind. . . . for many years he polished his glasses
(ecstasy of attrition!) or suffered the shakes and gracenote strangulations
and enthrottlements of the Winkelmusik of Szopen or Pichon or
Chopinek or Chopinetto or whoever it was embraced her heartily
as sure my name is Fred, dying  all my life (thank you Mr. Auber)
on a sickroom talent (thank you Mr Field) and a Kleinmeister's
Leidenschaftsucherei (thank you Mr Beckett). . . . (T  21, p.
16).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here Belacqua's mix of fantasy and memory, prompted by the encounter
with the astonishing Smeralda-Rima, gives rise to all sorts of
foreign words and grammatical constructions: <U>haricot</U> <U>skull</U>
(with its play on 'bean'), <U>Lucrezia del Fede</U> (Italian for
'Faith'), <U>Ne suis-je point p&acirc;le?  Suis-je belle?</U>
 (French for 'Am I not pale?  Am I beautiful?'), <U>pale belle
Braut</U> (English + French + German for 'pale beautiful bride'),
<U>Winkelmusic</U> (literally 'cornermusic',  here a spoof on
'chamber music' and 'chamberpot'), the phonetic plays and anagrams
on Chopin's name and the parodic compounding of <U>Kleinmeister's
Leidenschaftsucherei</U> ('Small master', on the analogy of <U>B&uuml;rgomeister</U>,
<U>Hau&szlig;meister, die Meistersinger</U>,  etc. combined with
 the grandiose neologism <U>Leidenschaftsucherei</U>, which translates
as 'lust-searching').  Such word-play contradicts Beckett's complaint
that English usually cannot capture the sensuous flavor of an
image or action:  <U>Winkelmusik</U>,  for example, nicely captures
the 'tinkle' of the chamberpot, and the long open dipthong and
voiceless stop in <U>Braut </U>has a very different phonetic aura
from <U>bride</U> with its <U>ay</U> glide and soft voiced stop.
  <U>Braut</U>, after all, rhymes with <U>Kraut</U> and <U>laut</U>.
 
<P>
 Still, such contrived shifts from one language to another are
ultimately distracting, taking us outside the text rather than
further into it.    Beckett seems to have sensed this.  Writing
in 1931 to Charles Prentice at Chatto and Windus, he remarked
that 'of course it ['Sedendo et Quiesciendo'] stinks of Joyce
in spite of earnest endeavours to endow it with my own odours'.
  And surely the perceived 'stink of Joyce' had something to do
with Beckett's turn, in the fifties, to a 'foreign' language--
French--for the writing of <U>Waiting for Godot</U> and the <U>Trilogy</U>.
  It is interesting to note that in fictions like <U>Malone Dies</U>,
he discarded the mannerisms of his early multilingual work in
favor of a much sparer, starker, monolingual writing, no longer
more than marginally Joycean. 
<P>
 But then, Joyce's own multilingualism had its own very special
parameters.  Consider the following passage from 'Anna Livia Plurabelle':
as published in its first version in <U>transition</U> 8 (November
1927):
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Do you tell me that now?  I do in troth.  Orara por Orbe and poor
Las Animas! Ussa, Ulla, we're umbas all!  Mezha, didn't you hear
it a deluge of times, ufer and ufer, respund to spond?  You deed,
you deed!  I need, I need!  It's that irrawaddying I've stoke
in my aars.  It all but husheth the lethest sound.  Oronoko.
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Here the opening conversation of the washerwomen begins realistically
enough but soon gives way to an allusion to the Spanish prayer
<U>orar por Orbe y por Las Animas</U> ('pray for the Earth and
the Souls of the Dead'), into which, Joyce has embedded three
river names: the Orara in New South Wales, the Orba in Italy,
and the Orb in France.  Further: <U>por</U> becomes &quot;poor&quot;
so that, comically enough, the women seem to be talking about
a friend or neighbor: 'poor Las Animas'.  In the next sentence,
<U>Ussa</U> and <U>Ulla</U> are both names of Russian rivers,
and, at the same time, as Walton Litz points out, the two words
can be read as 'us-&ccedil;a', 'you-l&agrave;', referring to the
near and far banks of the river.  In the same sentences, <U>Umbas</U>
is a portmanteau word combining <U>umbra</U> ('shade, ghost')
and the Umba river of East Africa.   Then, in the next sentence,
<U>Mezha</U> fuses the Italian stage direction <U>mezza voce</U>
with the name of the Indian river Meza and the exclamation 'ha',
the latter leading to the shrill cries of the washerwomen: 'you
deed, you deed!  I need, I need!'  These repeated exclamations
suggests that in the darkness (<U>umbra</U>), it has become more
and more difficult for the women to hear one another. 'A deluge
of times' nicely underscores the river-flood motif, and the German
'ufer and ufer' fuses river bank (<U>Ufer</U>) and Russian river
name ('Ufa') with the sound of 'over and over'.   <U>Ufa</U> also
means 'medium-sized fir pole or spar', so we can read the end
of the sentence as saying that spar after spar is spinning down
the Liffey destined for the pond in 'spond', with that word's
further implication of 'despond'. 
<P>
 Without going any further and probing the complexities of the
compound 'irrawaddying' (the Irrawaddy river + 'wadding' + 'ear'
+ 'irra-tional') or the final proper name 'Oronoko', (the royal
slave who is the hero Aphra Behn's novel + the Orinoco river +
a kind of Virginia tobacco), we can see that the linguistic paradigm
of the passage in question is essentially absorptive.  The language
base, that is to say, is so firmly Anglo-Irish ('Do you tell me
that now?  I do in troth') that the foreign words and morphemes-in
this case, Latin, Spanish, German, French, and Italian, not to
mention the proper names of rivers in a variety of languages,
all within the space of thirty-nine words--are absorbed into the
fabric of English syntax and word formation, complicating and
deepening meaning, without calling attention to themselves as
foreign elements.  Whereas a phrase like 'my belle Braut' is additive
(English + French + German), the question 'Mezha, didn't you hear
it a deluge of times, ufer and ufer, respund to spond', foregrounds
the basic structure and rhythm of the English sentence, and inserts
coinages and portmanteau words that sound familiar enough, as
in the case of 'ufer and ufer' ('over and over').  The result
is thus not so much a form of multilingualism as a reinvention
of English as magnet language, pulling in those particles like
 <U>Ussa</U> and <U>Ulla</U> or deftly transposing a Spanish preposition
(<U>por</U>) into an English adjective ('poor') so as to produce
a dense mosaic of intertextual references.
<P>
 Jean-Michel Rabat&eacute; has observed that the process of denaturalization
I have just described, the undoing of the taxonomy of language,
whether one's own or another's, was Joyce's way of declaring war
against English, 'against a mother tongue used to the limit, mimed,
mimicked, exploded, ruined'.    Jolas's multilingualism is of
a different order.  Neither in German nor in French, after all,
did this writer have the command Joyce had of English.   The official
language of his elementary school in Forbach had been German,
a language inevitably associated in the boy's mind with the Prussian
authoritarianism of his teachers.   The French of his youth, on
the other hand, was, properly speaking, a dialect 'related to
that of Luxembourg and the Flemish countries' (MB 9).   And further:
 both French and German lost their hold over Jolas when, as a
teen-ager, he gave up both for what he called the 'linguistic
jungle' of America.  Thus, despite his expertise at translating
one of his three languages into either of the others, an expertise
which is everywhere manifest in <U>transition</U> as well as in
such of his volumes as the superb <U>Anthologie de la nouvelle
po&eacute;sie am&eacute;ricaine,</U>  Jolas did not quite have
the hard-core language base of a Joyce or a Beckett, the latter
being able to write his novels in a 'foreign' language (French),
precisely because he was so sure of his native tongue.
<P>
For Jolas, in any case, the basic unit seems to have been, not
the sentence,  but the word, his compilation of 'Slanguage: 1929'
 and later 'Transition's Revolution of the Word Dictionary'  testifying
to his passion for what the Russian Futurists called <U>slovo
kak takovoe</U>-'the word as such'. In the Dictionary, the list
of neologisms, begins with six items from Joyce: <U>constatation</U>
('statement of a concrete fact'), <U>couchmare</U> ('nightmare
. . cauchemar. . .'),  <U>mielodorus</U> ('honeyed emphasis of
odorous'), <U>Dance McCaper</U> ('An Irish <U>danse macabre</U>'),
and <U>Besterfarther Zeuts</U> ('the Proustian divinity . . .
Cronos . . .Saturn  . . . who bests us all; in other words: Grandfather
Time-here Zeuts suggests both Zeus and Zeit, German for &quot;time&quot;').
  Joyce is thus the presiding deity of the Dictionary, but Jolas
includes writers from Leo Frobenius to Bob Brown (<U>readie</U>,
'machine for reading'), from Stuart Gilbert to Jolas's pseudonymous
poet Theo Rutra, whose contribution is <U>flir</U> ('to glitter').
  
<P>
 What, then, are the poems like?  In <U>Man from Babel</U>, Jolas
tells us that his 'first poems in the New World were written in
German' (MB 180), for example this perfectly conventional Romantic
quatrain in iambic pentameter:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   Ich steh' auf himmelragendem Gem&auml;uer,
<P>
   Allein im Schmelz vom letzten Abendschein;
<P>
   Die wilde Stadt umbraust mich ungeheur-
<P>
   Mein Herz schl&auml;gt traumgebannt in Stahl und Stein.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<P>
The transfer to English within the next few years made little
difference: indeed, the themes of dream, loneliness, and adolescent
lyricism remain constant, whether in metrical forms, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   I stand desolate before the funeral pyre of my youth.
<P>
   Ours is the dance and the magic of blessed dreams;
<P>
   And through the world goes a wind of despair.  (MB 25).
<P>
Or, in free verse:
<P>
   My nostalgias seek your moods
<P>
   In every meditative dusk,
<P>
   When I am tired with the tedium of machines,
<P>
   This age is distorted with madness. . .
<P>
   Fever stalks through the cities of stone. . .   (MB 51)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Now compare to these passages one of Jolas's early 'Ur-Language'
poems appearing in <U>transition</U> 8 (November 1927): 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   Oor forest hear thine voice it winks
<P>
   Ravines fog gleamen and the eyes
<P>
   When night comes dooze and nabel sinks
<P>
   Trowm quills unheard and lize. (145)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here is Jolas working toward the 'revolution of the word', with
the word itself as dominant:  'Oor' for 'Our' or <U>Ur</U>, 'gleamen',
a compound on the model of 'snowmen', 'night comes dooze',  that
is, 'down', fused with 'doze' and 'snooze', 'nabel (the German
<U>n&auml;bel</U> for 'fog', and this 'nabel' being one that 'sinks
/ Trowm&quot;-that is 'down' in the form of <U>traum</U> (German
for 'dream') and perhaps over the 'town'.  The stanza's final
word, 'lize', seems to be an intentional misspelling of <U>leise</U>,
German for 'softly', or 'in a low voice'.
<P>
 The difficulty here is that the Anglo-German compounds and portmanteaus
are more awkward than functional.  Why is it more graphic, complex,
or interesting to say 'nabel sinks /Trowm' than to say 'the fog
sinks dreamily down'?  Why transform the two-syllable <U>leise</U>
(pronounced <U>layz&eacute;</U>) into what looks like a reference
to lice or lizards, neither word applicable in the context?  More
successful that these  multilingual poems of the late twenties,
are Jolas's experiments with sound play in the form of alliteration,
assonance, onomatopoeia, metathesis, or echolalia.    In <U>Man
from Babel</U>, he recalls:
<P>
An expansion of language seemed necessary, also, in English and
American poetry.  Work on my translation of American poets had
impressed me with the paucity of vocabulary and the poverty of
the lyrical phrase, both of seemed to me to be meager and often
pedestrian.  This, I felt, prevented the poet from expressing
the deeper emotions which his unconscious might have evoked. 
I myself invented a poet I called Theo Rutra, in order to project
certain of my own neologistic work, and soon this fellow Rutra
became my alter ego.  I enjoyed playing him up to my friends,
to which I described in detail the &quot;Czech immigrant living
in Brooklyn&quot; (MB 109).  
<P>
Here is Theo Rutra's  prose poem 'Faula and Flona' (e.g., Flora
and Fauna): 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The lilygushes ring and ting the bilbels in the ivilley.  Lilools

  The morrowlei loors in the meaves.  The sardinewungs flir flar

34)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Joyce is the obvious model for words like <U>ivilley</U> ('ivy'
+ 'valley') and <U>plutocrass</U>, and Stein is also present,
the sentence 'The pool dries must' recalling 'Render clean must'
in her 'Susie Asado'.  But however pleasurable the language games
of 'Faula and Flona',  it is doubtful that, either here or in
the multilingual poems, Jolas has found a way of 'expressing the
deeper emotions which his unconscious might have evoked', or that
the ringing <U>lilygushes </U>and <U>bilbels</U> 'expand' the
language as we know it.  More important: the much touted 'Revolution
of the Word', a 'revolution' that seemed so glamorous to Jolas
and his friends in the late twenties, found itself increasingly
under a cloud as it ran into the very real political revolution
that brought the Nazis to power in 1932.  
<P>
In his autobiography, Jolas recalls a 1933  excursion he and his
wife Maria made with the Joyces and the Siegfried Gideons to the
Rhinefall of Schaffhausen, on the Swiss-German border.  Sitting
on the terrace of a little inn, facing the beautiful iridescent
waters of the swirling Rhine, 'we suddenly noticed at nearby tables
several grotesquely garbed Nazi youths who had crossed the border
for a Sunday excursion.  They wore their Hitlerite insignia with
ostentation and seemed evidently proud of this affiliation.  Soon
we heard their raucous voices in a dull Germanic tavern song,
and I could not help recalling the days in my childhood, when
we used to hear the drunken voices of the Kaiser's soldiers in
the little inn next to our house.  Nothing had changed' (MB 134).
<P>
 Note that even here, Jolas identifies people by their voices,
by the way they <U>sound</U>.  And note that the Nazis are aggressively
monolingual-for Jolas, a sign of narrow nationalist identity.
 No wonder, then, that the worse the political situation in Europe
became, the more insistently Jolas turned to multilingualism as
defense.  In the July 1935 issue of <U>transition</U> (now subtitled
<U>An International Experiment for Orphic Creation</U>),  Jolas
has a poem called &quot;Mots-Frontiere:  Polyvocables,&quot; which
begins:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<P>
 Jolas's 'Polyvocables' imply that if only poetry could contain
French + German + English in equal additive measure, the treacherous
frontiers increasingly separating the nations of Europe might
be crossed.  So the German <U>neumond</U> (new moon) <U>br&ucirc;leglisters</U>
('burns and glistens') in both French and English, and the German
<U>wunder stuerzt / ins tal</U> ('a wonder rushes into the valley')
with English 'eruptions'.  The 'tender <U>ent&ecirc;tement</U>'
('stubborness'), moreover, belongs not to <U>des arbres</U> but
to '<U>des trees</U>'.
<P>
 This last line reminds me of nothing so much as the refugee English
spoken by some of my Austrian relatives and family friends in
the United States of the early 1940s:  for example,  <U>Die bell
hatt geringt</U> ('The bell rang'),  with its normative German
syntax and retention of the German prefix for the past participle.
  In his study of <U>transition</U>, Dougal McMillan judges such
passages severely, arguing that 'The circumstances of [Jolas's]
trilingualism have left Americans, French, and Germans uncertain
as to the national category he belongs in'.  But this is to judge
Jolas by the very norms he was attacking; the problem is not national
indeter-minacy but the somewhat clumsy additive technique Jolas,
unlike Joyce, used in bringing his languages together.  Indeed,
another poem for the July 1935 issue, 'Logocin&eacute;ma of the
Frontierman', makes the A + B + C method quite overt:  the elegiac
meditation on the poet's words tracks the poet's life from the
German of his <U>Kindesworte</U> (<U>Immer leuchtete der Wunderkontinent</U>)
to the French of his stormy <U>adolescence (mes mots chevauchaient
une lavefronti&egrave;re</U>; <U>mes mots sanglotaient dans une
bacchanale de blessures</U>) and then the English of the poet's
young manhood in the asphalt jungle of New York:

<BR>

<P>
Following this triad, the 'Logocin&eacute;ma' continues in the
same vein for six more sections of approximately sixteen lines
each, now in English, but with occasional German and French intrusions,
as in 'My homewords were <U>heimwehkrank</U> / my loamwords were
full of <U>sehnsucht</U>' (IV), and, as the 'motherwords' and
'fatherwords' of the poet's Alsace-Lorraine childhood come back,
we find lines like '<U>mes mots pleuvaient doucement sur les boulevards</U>',
with its echo of Blaise Cendrars.  As things become more complex
('my fatherwords luminousshone with sun' (VII), and 'my delugewords
flowed through the heraclitean sluice' (VIII), Jolas tries to
bring his linguistic identities together ('patois words wedded
artwords/ sunverbs flightrocketed against nightnouns', VIII),
and finally the cinematic movement brings all three languages
together in IX, which begins '<U>Not hatte die welt ergriffen</U>
/ the day was waiting for <U>erschuetterungen</U>' (e.g., 'Suffering
had taken hold of the world / the day was waiting for cataclysms',
although the first word of the stanza can also be construed as
the English 'Not') and culminates in a Last Judgement ('the <U>letzte
gericht</U>') of '<U>des damn&eacute;s de la terre</U>' (IX).
 The last short stanza reads:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   toutes les nuits &eacute;taient squelletiques
<P>
   die hunde schrieen sich tot in den hecken
<P>
   les for&ecirc;ts de la lune myst&egrave;re br&ucirc;laient
<P>
   the world was earthquakedarkling   (p. 191)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here each of the four lines-French, German, French, English--
is rhythmically independent, but each anticipates the next:  the
skeleton nights (line 1) contain the dogs barking themselves to
death in the hedges (line 2) and the burning forests of the mysterious
moon (line 3); thus (line 4) the world's enveloping darkness 
signals earthquake, cataclysm. The autobiographical frame, with
its emphasis on the coming into being of the 'delugewords', provides
structure for the poet's kaleidoscopic 'logocin&eacute;ma of the
frontiersman'.
<P>
But that 'logocin&eacute;ma', found again in such poems as 'Intrialogue',
'Verbairrupta of the Mountainmen', and 'Frontier-Poem', produced
by Jolas in the course of the following three years,  did not
survive the World War II.  When, at war's end, Jolas was stationed
in Germany by the U.S. Office of War Information (OWI) and assigned
to various deNazification projects as well as to the task of setting
up a new free German press, the dream of a common language was
over.  Post-War Germany, so Jolas tells us in <U>Man from Babel</U>,
was characterized by a 'vague-Neo-Romanticism'; 'a good deal of
poetry was being written and published, but the ferment and audacity
of French, British, and American poetic creation was obviously
lacking' (MB 252).  Indeed, the problems of the post-war years
and the coming Cold War left little time for what now seemed like
the luxury of polylingual poetry.   
<P>
 Yet this is not the end of the story.   For Jolas's 'polyvocables'
of the 1930s, his <U>mots-frontiere,</U>  look ahead to the intense
poetic interest in marginal languages, dialects, creoles, pidgins,
and alternate soundings that we have witnessed in recent decades,
especially in the U.S.  In the 1940s, the last decade of Jolas's
own life (he died in 1952), the flow of American writers settling
in Paris and other European capitals was reversed, New York becoming
the home of Kandinsky and Mondrian, Andr&eacute; Breton and Max
Ernst, Willem de Kooning and Hans Hofmann, not to mention an entire
colony of German exile writers (Thomas Mann, Bertold Brecht) and
British expatriates (Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood), who
settled in Los Angeles.  And in subsequent decades, as the U.S.
has been transformed by the immigration of East Asians, Africans
from the Caribbean,and especially Latinos from Mexico, Central
America and the South American countries, it was inevitable that
the language of American poetry would begin to deviate, not only
from its nineteenth-century English model (Wordsworth to Eliot)
but also from the Emerson-Whitman-Dickinson-Frost-Stevens paradigm
that was its more immediate source. 
<P>
 'We tried', Jolas remarks sadly in the Epilogue to <U>Man from
Babel,</U> 'to give voice to the sufferings of man by applying
a liturgical exorcism in a mad verbalism'. But 'now that the greatest
war in history is over, and the nations are trying to construct
a troubled peace in an atomic era, we realize that the international
migrations which the apocalyptic decade has unleashed bring in
their wake a metamorphosis of communication' (MB 272).  The solution,
he was quick to add, 'will not be invented by philologists-we
have seen their inventions:  Idiom Neutral, Ido, Esperanto, Novial,
Interglossa.  These were pedantic, unimaginative creations without
any life in them' (MB 272-73).  Rather, one must take one's own
language-and English, Jolas felt, was now the most prominent,
used as it was by seven hundred million people around the world--
and 'bring into this medium elements from all the other languages
spoken today'. The new language 'should not number several hundred
thousand words, but millions of words.  It will not be an artificial
language, but one that has its roots in organic life itself' (MB
272)
<P>
 The notion of interjecting 'all the other languages spoken today'
into the fabric of English is still a bit Utopian, but Jolas is
on to something important-namely that multilingualism functions,
not by mere addition, but by the infusion <U>into one's own language</U>
of the cultures that are changing its base.  As a young reporter
living in New Orleans, Jolas had been enchanted by the 'Creole
French spoken, by both whites and Negroes', as well by 'the language
of the descendants of transplanted French Canadians from Nova
Scotia' which is Cajun.  'Their  children',  he  marvelled, 'were
  Ulysse,  T&eacute;l&eacute;maque,  Ol&eacute;lia, Omen' (MB
84),  And he would  no doubt have been intrigued   by the following:

<P>
Brathwaite, Arteaga, Cha:  all three write as outsider poets-poets
for whom English is, in one way or another, a foreign language.
 Kamau Brathwaite, to take our first example, who was born Lawson
Edward Brathwaite in Barbados in1930 and educated at Pembroke
College, Cambridge, came, via a decade spent in Ghana with the
Ministry of Education, to a rediscovery of his West Indian identity
(the name Kamau was adopted in 1971) and to what he called, in
an important book by that title, <U>nation language</U>: 'the
submerged area of that dialect which is much more closely allied
to the African aspect of experience in the Caribbean', a language
that combines standard English and Jamaican Creole, 'to get at
the pulse', as Joan Dayan puts it, 'of the street talk, gospel,
or Rastafari he shared in and listened to in Jamaica',  the 'riddim'
(rhythm) of popular talk.  In the later work, of which <U>Trench
Town Rock</U> is an example, Brathwaite fused 'nation language'
with what he called 'video style':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . the video style comes out of the resources locked  within
the computer, esp. my Macs Sycorax &amp; Stark (<FONT SIZE=1>but
not peculiar to them or mwe</FONT>) in the same way a sculptor
like Bob'ob or Kapo wd say that the images they make dream for
them from the block of the wood in their chisel<BR>

<P>
When I discover that the computer cd write in light, as X/Self
 tells his mother in that first letter he writes on a computer,
I discovered a whole new way of SEEING things I was SAYING. .
. .<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Defined this way, 'video style' may be understood as another name
for what we usually call visual poetics:  the use of typography
(size, font, placement) and page layout to create meaning.   
<P>
 <U>Trench Town Rock</U>, whose opening page is reproduced above,
is an elaborate collage (or <U>m&eacute;tissage</U>, as Edouard
Glissant called it) based on poet's traumatic experience of having
had his house ransacked on October 24, 1990 by armed robbers while
he, gagged, and tied, helplessly waited for the gun to go off.
 The book juxtaposes interviews, news reports, personal diaries,
and social commentary to create a powerful image of violence and
victimization within a culture itself a victim of more powerful
cultures.  In the passage in question, the mix of Standard English
and Creole is heightened by the urban rhythms of the Jamaican
soundspace, beginning with 'Lass night about 2:45 well well well
before the little black bell of the walk of my electronic clock
cd wake me'-a dazzling sound orchestration of /l/, /w/, and /k/
phonemes in rhyming words ('well well well' / 'bell'), consonance
('walk'/ 'wake'; 'electronic clock'), and alliteration ('little
black bell', 'clock cd').   Such double entendres as 'aweakened
by gunshatt' heighten the poem's meaning:  the narrator is both
awakened and weakened by the muggers; 'gunshatt' recalls shit,
'nuh' in &quot;do / nuh kill me', has the force of an expletive
as well as the injunction of 'not'.  And Brathwaite's 'video style',
recalls Futurist typography in its heightening of the<B> 'TWO
SHATTS'</B>, its emphasis on the italicized injunction '<U>do
do do nuh kill me'</U>, and its use of up-to-date business English
shorhand, as in 'cd', 'wd',  the ampersands, and the precision
of '2:45'.  Further: the slashes within words ('some/where', 'ear/ring's')
creates a series of emphatic breaking points, designed to represent
the violence of the action.  Everything is chaotic, dismembered,
disabled.
<P>
Brathwaite's multilingualism is thus a compounding of English
and Jamaican dialect, with visual language playing a central part.
 Alfred Arteaga's, by contrast, fuses two standard languages,
English and Spanish, with a sprinkling of Aztec names and Chicano
neologisms.  Arteaga is a Mexican-American poet, born in Los Angeles
and educated at Columbia University and the University of California
at Santa Cruz, where he received his doctorate in Renaissance
literature.  'These cantos chicanos', Arteaga says in his preface,
'begin with X and end with X.  They are examples of xicano verse,
verse marked with a cross, the border cross of alambre y r&iacute;o,
the cross of Jesus X in Native America, the nahuatl X in m&eacute;xico,
mexican, xicano' (<U>Cantos</U> 5).  The cross (X) thus becomes
the sign of two colliding cultures and languages.  The title 'Xronotop
Xicano' presents one such crossing: a <U>chronotope</U> (Mikhail
Bakhtin's term) literally means &quot;time-space,&quot; and is
defined as 'a unit of analysis for studying texts according to
the ratio and nature of the temporal and spatial categories represented'.
 In this case, the modern Western theoretical term <U>chronotope</U>
is crossed with the adjective 'Xicano',  and refers, in the poem
itself, to the language of Aztlan (the ancient Aztec empire that
included Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and California).
 Within the poem itself, emblems of the Aztec Mexican past 'cross'
the present of Chicano ghetto children etching their names, their
curses (<U>desaf&iacute;os)</U>, their <U>placas</U> ('graffiti'),
 and four-letter words, on walls, storefronts, billboards, and
car windows.  
<P>
 In defining the particular chronotope in question, Arteaga alternates
Spanish and English phrases, the Spanish often made strange by
'Chicano' spellings and adaptations.  The opening line <U>Aguila
negra, rojo chante</U> refers to the black eagle devouring the
serpent on the red ground of the Mexican flag.  But <U>chante</U>
may be the imperative of <U>chantar</U> ('to plant') or a mispelled
rendition of the English noun 'chant'(or French <U>chanter</U>,
'to sing'), so that the meaning of the line remains equivocal.
  And <U>vato</U> in line 4 (along with the feminine <U>vata</U>
in line 5) is largely untranslatable-a term designating a victim
or 'lost boy',  but etymologically related to the Latin <U>vates</U>
('prophet')-hence perhaps the boy as wise fool.  The <U>vato,</U>
in any case, has <U>la vida loca</U> ('the crazed life', 'the
life of the mad') hanging around his neck, even as the <U>vata</U>'s
fate is <U>p.v.</U> (<U>por vida</U>, 'for life').  So the poet
must take <U>tinta y pluma</U> ('ink and pen') and record the
t<U>extos viv</U>os of his people, caught up in their <U>ganga</U>
('bargain') 'with tears', which is their own 'shining cross' to
bear,  <U>ganga</U> also alluding to the gang life of the <U>varrio</U>
(<U>barrio</U>),  with its members' 'names etched / in glass'
on the schoolhouse walls. 
<P>
Here language is the signifier of cultural hybridity, the 'cross'
between Spanish and English which is the Chicano of the North
American cities.   To write only in English (or only in Spanish),
Arteaga implies, would deny this experience its immediacy, its
felt life.  Whereas Brathwaite was raised as an English speaker,
and hence resorts to dialect but not to other standard languages,
Arteaga must include the 'foreign'(Spanish) language base of his
childhood. 
<P>
 A third alternative is that of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, a Korean
poet whose family immigrated first to Hawaii and then to California
when she was eleven.  At the Convent of the Sacred Heart all-girls
school in San Francisco, she learned French so that, by the time
she attended Berkeley and studied film and performance art, her
two written languages were a carefully acquired English and French.
  Accordingly, <U>Dict&eacute;e</U>, the long poem Cha produced
shortly before she was tragically murdered by a stranger in New
York at the age of 31, is an amalgam of English and French, the
latter, so to speak, her memory language.  The poem tells the
story of several women, united by their suffering: the Korean
revolutionary Yu Guan Soon, Joan of Arch, Cha's mother, Demeter
and Persephone, Hyung Soon Huo (a Korean born in Manchuria to
first-generation Korean exiles) and Cha herself.   The poet mixes
writing styles (journal entries, allegorical stories, dreams),
voices, and kinds of information, evidently as a metaphor of the
dislocation of exile, the fragmentation of memory.  Throughout
her poem, Cha foregrounds the process of writing, its difficulties
and revisions, its struggle to make sentences cohere.  Hence,
the broken sentences and Gertrude Steinian repetitions in the
extract I have cited-'Point by point.  Up to date.  Updated'-the
endless full stops, suggesting extreme cleavage, as in 'Inside.
 Outside. / Glass. Drape.  Lace. Curtain.  Blinds.  Gauze'.  The
search for identity, for personhood, is continually subverted.
 Opaque glass, veil, screen, blind, curtain, shade--these are
Cha's dominant images of oppression and occlusion.  
<P>
 In this context, French phrases, learned dutifully in school,
are presented as welling up from the poet's subconscious.  On
the page prior to the extract above, a long passage begins with
the lines <U>Qu'est ce qu'on a vu / Cette vue qu'est ce qu'on
a vu / enfin.  Vu E.  Cette vue.  Qu'est ce que c'est enfin</U>.
('What have we seen?  What is the seen that we have finally seen.
 Seen And.  This thing seen. What is it finally?').    The 'childish'
French takes on a manic air as the sentence is broken apart and
repeated for some ten lines.  And, as memories of school prayers
and lessons intrude on the poet's fevered thoughts, the 'veil'
becomes <U>Voile.  Voile de mari&eacute;e.  Voile de religieuse</U>.
 The wish to shed the veil is also put in French-- <U>ala derobee</U>
(correctly spelled <U>&agrave; la derob&eacute;e</U>)-- just as
the need to suppress one's voice introduces the Italian <U>voce
velata</U> ('veiled voice').
<P>
 But where is Cha's native language, Korean?  The cited passage
does not contain a single transliterated Korean word, not a single
ideogram or overtly Asian reference.  Evidently, the distant past
of the poet's childhood, the difficult movements of her family
from place to place during the Korean War, have been blocked out.
 Korean appears only as an absence in the life of a woman dutifully
bound to English with schoolgirl memories of textbook French.
 It is thus the English language that becomes the problem, the
English language that must be fragmented, broken, deconstructed,
reconstructed, and so on.  The title <U>Dict&eacute;e</U> (<U>Dictation</U>)
thus refers to the indoctrination through language the immigrant
must undergo.  But <U>Dikte</U> is also the name of a Cretan goddess
'whom Minos pursued for nine months until, about to be overtaken,
she hurled herself from a cliff into the sea'.   A victim, it
seems, like the young girl who dutifully writes her <U>dict&eacute;e</U>.
 
<P>
 So much for Theresa Hak Kiung Cha's overt devices.  But surely
there is another reason Cha avoids Korean.  Polyglossia remains
a noble ideal, but who would be able to read the potential Korean
words and phrases dotting her long poem?  French and Spanish:
 these still have a recognition quotient, and Brathwaite's Jamaican
dialect can be sounded out and comprehended by any English speaker.
 But a multilingual poetry that would include Korean?  Or, for
that matter, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Arabic?  Or again,
Brazilian Portugese?  Hungarian?  
<P>
 The conundrum posed by <U>Dict&eacute;e</U>, a poem I personally
find somewhat self-conscious in its treatment of the 'language
problem', is a conundrum Jolas could not quite anticipate.  For
the paradox of the contemporary situation is that the new version
of multilingualism-and many poets are now following the example
of Brathwaite-- far from supporting the internationalism that
animated Jolas's poetry as well as the work collected in <U>transition</U>,
has been prompted by precisely the opposite motive-a motive that
is unabashedly nationalist, ethnicist, nativist.  When the Brathwaite
baptized Lawson Edward became, in middle life, Kamau, he turned
to the 'nation language' of West Indian culture so as provide
a more accurate representation of a people largely erased by history.
 His interjections of dialect, street slang, folk rhythms, Rastafari,
African myth, legend, and geographical markers are quite openly
motivated by the desire to put the Caribbean experience on the
map of modern poetry and fiction.  In the same vein, Alfred Arteaga
uses Spanish and its Chicano dialects to foreground a particular
ethnic experience, and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha writes from the positionality
of the displaced Asian &eacute;migr&eacute; woman who cannot quite
locate herself in the U.S. culture of her time.  Indeed, Cha's
shifts from English to French have nothing to do with any sort
of tribute to the French language or French culture; on the contrary,
the French phrases and idioms  signal the deadness of a learned
language that is not the poet's own.  
<P>
 Jolas's polyglossia, designed to bring together diverse peoples,
to erase borders between the European nations, to produce a large
cosmopolitan and international consciousness-<U>E Pluribus Unum</U>--
has thus been radically inverted.  Not the melting pot, one of
Jolas's favorite images, but the particular values of a particular
underrepresented culture, not the erasure <U>of</U> borders, but
the focus <U>on</U> borders, not internationalism but national
and ethnic awareness:  this is the realm of <U>mots-frontiere</U>
that has replaced Jolas's dream of a 'new language', his 'super-tongue
for intercontinental expression'.  Indeed, 'intercontinental',
is now a word used sparingly and when it is, as in the case of
those ICBMs with which we threaten weaker enemy nations, the vision
is far from  Utopian.<BR>

 4. In <U>transition</U> #3 (June 1927), which contained Stein's
'As A Wife Has a Cow' as lead-off piece, as well as Laura Riding's
'The New Barbarism and Gertrude Stein',  the editorial praises
Stein as 'abstract artist', who 'compos[es] her word patterns
without an accompanying text of obvious explanations' (p. 177).
 In the December 1927 issue, he defends Stein against the notorious
attack by Wyndham Lewis (see p. 172).  And in 'The Revolution
of Language and James Joyce',' <U>transition </U> 11 (February
1928), Jolas writes 'Miss Gertrude Stein attempts to find a mysticism
of the word by the process of thought thinking itself.  In structurally
spontaneous compositions in which words are grouped rhythmically,
she succeeds in giving us her mathematics of the word, clear,
primitive  and beautiful' (p. 111).
<P>
 The note for the <U>Anthologie</U>, longer than any of the others,
declares '<U>Tender Buttons</U>, paru il y a quelques ann&eacute;es,
l'a montr&eacute;e comme poss&eacute;dant un vrai g&eacute;nie
d'innovation dans le style, et ses derniers livres n'ont aucun
rapport avec les genres litt&egrave;raires que nous connaissons'
(p. 217).<BR>

 7. Samuel Beckett, letter to Charles Prentice, 23 March 1931, cited
in James Knowlson, <U>Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett</U>
(New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996), p. 156.  Chatto and Windus
turned Beckett's manuscript down almost immediately. <BR>

<P>
8.  <U>Finnegans Wake</U> (1939; New York: Penguin, 1976), p. 214.
  The passage first appeared in <U>transition</U> 8 (November
1927), as follows:  
<P>
Do you tell me that now?  I do in troth.  And didn't you hear
it a deluge of times?  You deed, you deed!  I need, I need! 
<P>

and derivations, see A. Walton Litz, <U>The Art of James Joyce:

12. MB 18.  The lines read: 'I stand on the battlements, reaching
up to the sky; / Alone in the sunset glow; / The wild city roars
violently around me; / My dreambound heart beats in steel and
stone'.<BR>

<P>
13.  The version cited in MB (p. 109) is slightly different.  'Ivilley'
 is 'ivlleyo', 'morrolei'  is 'lorroley', 'meaves'  is 'neaves',
'sardinewungs'  becomes 'sardine-swungs', 'flight'  becomes 'light',
'mickmecks'  becomes 'mickmacks'.   It is not clear whether these
are transcription errors, misprints, or intentional changes.<BR>

<P>
14.  The subtitle first appears in #21 (March 1932), when Jolas began
to turn increasingly inward, in response to the two great totalitarianisms
of the day.  This issue contains the roundtable &quot;Crisis of
Man,&quot; in which Stein, Jung, Benn, and Frobenius, among other,
comment on the &quot;evolution of individualism and metaphysics
under a collectivist regime&quot; (p. 107).  <BR>

<P>
15.  T 23 (July 1935): 65.  The title, 'Mots-Frontiere'  is odd: the
correct grammar and spelling would make it 'Mots-fronti&egrave;res'.
 Again, 'neumond','wunder', and 'tal'  should be capitalized.
 Throughout this and related poems, Jolas tends to reproduce German
nouns without the required initial capital.<BR>

750-57), Elaine Savory discusses the poet's 'video style'.  'Bob'ob'
was Brathwaite's grandfather's brother, a carpenter; 'Kapo' is
a Jamaican folk wood sculptor called Mallacai Reynolds whom Brathwaite
knew in the mid 1970s (see Savory 756, note 5).<BR>

29. While I was completing this essay, I received the most recent
issue of <U>Chain</U>, issue 5: 'Different Languages' (1998),
ed. Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr.  Most of the work in this issue
is bilingual (often English and Spanish) or multilingual, in keeping
with the aesthetic of Brathwaite and Cha rather than the internationalism
of Jolas, although many of the experiments, like Will Lavender's
'Glossolalia' (pp. 125-29) and Jessie Jane Lewis and Peter Rose's
'Pressures of the Text' (pp. 130-37), interpret multilingualism
as the insertion, into the English structure, of technological
languages, dialects, pictograms, visual devices, and so on.  
<P>
 Multilingualism, in any case, is, as we see in <U>Chain</U>,
very much in the air.<BR>
