<FONT SIZE=2>The primary purpose of radio is to convey information
from one place     to another through the intervening media (i.e.
air space, nonconducting     materials) without wires.  </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>   -- Thesis:  The phonograph emphasizes the self
in the lack of subject.      This machine bears a paradox:  it
identifies a voice, fixes the deceased (or    mortal) person,
registers the dead and thus perpetuates his living     testimony,
but also achieves his automatic reproduction <I>in absentia</I>:
my     self would live <I>without me</I> --horror of horrors!</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>The Beckett who began to write radio plays
in the mid-fifties was no stranger to the medium: in Roussillon,
where he lived in hiding from 1942-45, the radio transmitter was
<I>the</I> crucial information conduit for Resistance groups,
and the BBC, which was to commission <I>All That Fall </I>(1956)
and <I>Embers</I> (1959), its main source.   Half a century
later, as the <I>Columbia Encyclopedia</I> reminds us,
radio is still primarily an information medium, a conductor of
<I>messages</I>, whether news flashes, announcements of
events, weather reports,  and today the ubiquitous &quot;sigalerts&quot;
that advise the driver about freeway conditions and traffic accidents
even as they are taking place.
<P>
 All the more reason, then, for the radio artist--and Beckett
is surely one of the finest --to turn this information function,
this relaying of messages from A to B, inside out.  &quot;Communication,&quot;
writes Michel Serres, &quot;is only possible between two persons
used to the same forms, trained to code and decode a meaning by
using the same key.&quot;  But communication is never without
disruption: &quot;in spoken languages: stammerings, mispronunciations,
regional accents, dysphonias, and cacophonies  . . . . In the
technical means of communication: background noise, jamming, static,
cut-offs, heteresis, various interruptions.  If static is accidental,
background noise is <I>essential</I> to communication&quot;
(SER 66).  &quot;To communicate orally&quot; is thus &quot;to
lose meaning in noise.&quot; Only at the level of mathematical
abstraction, when form (e.g., the symbol <I>x</I> or the
addition sign <I>+</I> ) is distinguished from its empirical
realizations, is dialogue entirely &quot;successful.&quot;  But
&quot;to exclude the empirical is to exclude differentiation,
the plurality of others that mask the same&quot; (SER 69), and
it is those &quot;others&quot;--the interference and noise that
everywhere blocks the straightforward A &gt; B model of transmission--
that really matter in the communication paradigms that we actually
use. &quot;The transmission of communication,&quot; writes Serres,
&quot;is chronic transformation. . . .  the empirical is strictly
essential and accidental <I>noise</I>&quot; (SER 70).
<P>
 The notion of &quot;noise&quot; as &quot;the empirical portion
of the message&quot; is by no means confined to radio, but we
see it heightened in this medium where everything depends upon
sound, primarily the sound of the human voice as communicator.
 Martin Esslin, who worked closely with Beckett on his BBC productions
and has written extensively on the radio plays, argues that &quot;radio
is an intensely visual medium. . . . Information that reaches
[the listener] through other senses is instantly converted into
visual terms.  And aural experiences, which include the immense
richness of language as well as musical and natural sound, are
the most effective means of triggering visual images.&quot;  This
may be true of the more mimetic variants of radio drama--Beckett's
first radio play <I>All That Fall</I> is a case in point--
but what happens when, as Klaus Schoening points out in a discussion
of the new acoustic art, words are combined with &quot;nontextual
language, nonverbal articulations, quotation, original sound [i.e.,ambient
sound], environmental noises,  acoustic objects trouv&eacute;,
musical tones, [and] electronic technology&quot;?   What do we
visualize then?
<P>
 Beckett's radio experiments did not, of course, go as far as,
say, John Cage's <I>Roaratorio</I> (one of Schoening's
key exhibits) in undermining the conventional linguistic base,
but he was surely aware that if the transmission of information
is one pole of the radio experience, soundscape is the other.
 Indeed, as Don Druker puts it in a discussion of radio, &quot;it
is necessary to consider <I>sound itself</I> as the raw
material for analysis.&quot;  One must, for that matter, listen
to radio more intensively than one does in the theater, where
there is always something to <I>look at</I> as well.  On
the other hand, radio text also differs appreciably from the print
media.   When reading, one has the luxury of stopping to reconsider
this or that point on a previous page, or one skims a given passage
and moves ahead.  Radio is much more coercively temporal; the
sounds succeed each other, and the listener is challenged to take
them in, one by one, and construct their relationships.  Even
when, as is usually the case, the radio piece is heard on tape
or compact disc, so that one is free to fast forward and reverse,
the listener remains deprived of the visual stimulus taken for
granted by the theater goer or television viewer. 
<P>
 Even more important:  because radio is essentially an information
medium with what appears to be a linear structure, the listener
feels compelled to pay close attention with the expectation of
&quot;finding out&quot; something.   But what does Beckett's radio
audience find out?   Here the theme of disembodiment put forward
in my second epigraph becomes important.  If radio (or the phonograph)
has the capacity to bring <I>voice</I> into someone else's
public or private space, the disembodiment of that voice, Beckett
was quite aware, is a signifier of <I>absence</I>, of not
being there, indeed of &quot;death.&quot;   Then, too, voice alone--or
at least voice between puberty and extreme old age or serious
illness-- cannot define its owner's stage of life or status as
can the visual image of a human body.  
<P>
 As a dramatic medium, radio is at its best when it takes this
indeterminacy and absence into account.   After <I>All That</I>
<I>Fall</I>, whose characters are still represented as
&quot;real&quot; people in a &quot;real&quot; Irish country setting,
 Beckett's radio art becomes more abstract and mediumistic, engaging
in a dialectic of disclosure and obstacle, information and noise,
in which the soundscape -- which includes silence-- provides conflicting,
and hence tantalizing, testimony.  In what follows I want to consider
how this dialectic works in what I take to be, in Hugh Kenner's
words, &quot;the most original use to which Beckett has put radio,
and one is tempted to say as original and moving a use of any
to which radio has been put.&quot;   The play is <I>Embers</I>,
written for the BBC and first broadcast on 24 June 1959.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<B>&quot;No Sound&quot;<BR>
</B>

<P>
 Beckett commentators generally speak of <I>Embers</I>
as a &quot;skullscape&quot; or &quot;soulscape.&quot;   &quot;The
universe which the radio audience is confronted with,&quot; declared
Clas Zilliacus in the first extended discussion of the piece,
&quot;is a totally subjective one: it is one man's world.  The
interplay between Henry and other characters takes place in Henry's
mind&quot; (CL 82).  The same point is made by Martin Esslin:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>The background--a background of sound, the sea, Henry's
boots on the shingle--is still real, but the voices are all internal:
Henry's internal monologue as he tries unsuccessfully to conjure
up his dead father's presence, and later the voices of his wife
and daughter and her instructors, which materialize in his memory.
(BSG 368).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
And in a survey of Beckett's radio and television plays for the
recent <I>Cambridge Companion to Beckett</I>, Jonathan
Kalb<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>remarks that &quot;<I>Embers</I>
has no surface narrative other than that of a haunted man talking
about talking to himself, telling stories that he never finishes,
and sometimes experiencing (along with us) the ghostly people
and things in his story.&quot; Kalb gives the following precis:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> Henry, who may or may not be walking by the sea
with his daughter Addie nearby, addresses his dead father, who
may or may not have committed suicide in the sea.  The father
fails to respond . . . and Henry tells a story about a man named
Bolton (perhaps a father-surrogate) who has called for his doctor
Holloway one winter night, for obscure reasons that may have to
do with wanting to die.  Henry then speaks to a woman, also apparently
dead, named Ada, his former companion and mother of Addie, who
speaks sympathetically but distractedly back to him.  For most
of the remainder of the action Ada and Henry reminisce about old
times, some of which are dramatized as auditory flashbacks involving
other characters.  Henry complains several times of not being
able to rid himself of the sound of the sea, and Ada suggests
that he consult Holloway about both that and his incessant talking
to himself.  When Ada no longer answers him, Henry tries unsuccessfully
to command the sound effects again, returns briefly to the Bolton
story and then ends by seeming to make a note in his diary:  'Nothing
all day nothing.&quot;  (JKCC, 129-30).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This account of <I>Embers</I> as memory play taking place
inside Henry's mind is accurate enough in its broad outlines,
but it seems to ignore the use of radio as medium, even though
Beckett himself, in a much cited statement about his first radio
play <I>All That Fall</I>, insisted that the distinction
between media had to be honored:
<P>
 <I>All That Fall</I><FONT SIZE=2>
is a specifically radio play, or rather radio text, for voices,
not bodies.  I have already refused to have it &quot;staged&quot;
and I cannot think of it in such terms.  A perfectly straight
reading before an audience seems to me just barely legitimate,
though even on this score I have my doubts.  But I am absolutely
opposed to any form of adaptation with a view to its conversion
into &quot;theatre.&quot;  It is no more theatre than <I>End-Game</I>
is radio and to &quot;act&quot; it is to kill it.  Even the reduced
visual dimension it will receive from the simplest and most static
of readings . . . will be destructive of whatever quality it may
have and which depends on the whole thing's <I>coming out of
the dark</I>.</FONT>
<P>
&quot;To 'act' it is to kill it&quot;: &quot;radio text,&quot;
Beckett here reminds us, is par excellence an art that depends
on sound alone and hence cannot be converted to the stage.   Furthermore,
the sound in question is not just that of the human voice but
includes a complex network of nonverbal elements, musical or otherwise.
 It makes little sense, then, to complain, as does John Pilling,
that Beckett should have included the voice of Henry's father,
along with Ada's and Addie's voices, in the play:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>The puzzling thing is that Henry's control over voices
does not extend to the most crucial figure of all, his father.
. . . The failure to incorporate into the physical existence of
the play its most important figure is not so much a failure of
conception--though it might have served to link Henry's life to
his story of Bolton-- as of tact.  There seems to be no good reason
for the omission</FONT>.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
But there is a very good reason for the omission, which is that,
unlike the theater, radio makes it possible to represent characters
by means of metonymic sound images: The ghost of Henry's father
is indeed &quot;heard&quot; throughout the play: not only when
his son acts the role of medium, imitating such parental exhortations
as &quot;Are you coming for a dip?&quot;,  but also in the recurrent
&quot;Please! PLEASE!&quot; that Bolton addresses to Holloway,
and, most important, in the voice of the sea itself.   Indeed,
Henry's is not quite an interior monologue like Malone's or the
Unnamable's, for it moves easily in and out of the the narrator's
specific consciousness and depends heavily on the elaborate patterning
of phrasal, verbal, and phonemic repetition.  
<P>
 Henry's first halting words in <I>Embers</I> are &quot;On,&quot;
&quot;Stop,&quot; and &quot;Down,&quot; each one spoken twice,
the second time more emphatically, as the exclamation points indicate.
  The predominant vowel sound is a long open &quot;o&quot; competing
with the sound of the sea: [<I>Sea, still faint, audible throughout
what follows whenever pause indicated.]</I>&quot;  The &quot;o&quot;
sound now modulates into the longer unit &quot;Who is beside me
now?&quot; and after the response &quot;[<I>Pause.</I>]
An old man, blind and foolish. [<I>Pause</I>.] My father,
back from the dead, to be with me.  [<I>Pause</I>.]  As
if he hadn't died.  [<I>Pause</I>],&quot; we hear the words,
&quot;No, he doesn't answer me.&quot;  &quot;No,&quot; which will
soon become one of the key words in the Bolton narrative (&quot;no,
hangings,&quot; &quot;no light,&quot; &quot;no, standing,&quot;
&quot;no sound,&quot; and then the variant &quot;not a sound,&quot;
(which will be Henry's final words in the play),  is, of course
a reversal of the opening &quot;On.&quot;  From &quot;On to &quot;No&quot;:
 this is the trajectory of Henry's speech,  his Omega (note that
both &quot;Bolton&quot; and &quot;Holloway&quot; contain long
&quot;o&quot;s as well) in conflict with the Alpha of his wife's
name &quot;Ada,&quot; and the diminutive of Ada in the child's
name  &quot;Addie.&quot;  The narrator Henry, for that matter,
whose family name we never know, is so to speak caught phonemically
between Alpha and Omega.  When one hears Ada speak lines like
&quot;Laugh, Henry do that for me&quot; (E 97), the /e/ and /I/
phonemes stand out as distinct from the other names.  
<P>
 But it is not quite accurate to say, as Pilling does, that Henry
has &quot;control&quot; over the voices in the play.  For the
dominant voice is not Henry's but the voice of the sea.  It is
that voice that punctuates each of Henry's questions about his
father--&quot;Can he hear me? [<I>Pause.]</I>  Yes, he
must hear me.  [<I>Pause</I>.]  To answer me [<I>Pause.</I>]
 No, he doesn't answer me [<I>Pause</I>]  Just be with
me&quot;--and that is presented as a character in its own right
in the following strange speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>That sound you hear is the sea.  [<I>Pause</I>.
 <I>Louder</I>.]   I say that sound you hear is the sea,
we are sitting on the strand.  [<I>Pause</I>.]  I mention
it because the sound is so strange, so unlike the sound of the
sea, that if you didn't see what it was you wouldn't know what
it was. [<I>Pause</I>.]  (E 93)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The &quot;you&quot; here can be taken to be the dead father, with
whom Henry is sitting on the strand.  But if so, it makes little
sense since, as we soon learn, the father lived at the sea's edge
all his life and presumably would know how the sea sounds.   Henry's
information thus functions ironically, or even metalinguistically:
 on the one hand, it shows the narrator having a brief moment
of power over the father whose death haunts him;  on the other,
we can read the speech as an aside to the audience, especially
in connection with the next sentence:  &quot;if you didn't see
what it was you wouldn't know what it was&quot;--an absurd statement
given that of course the radio audience cannot &quot;see&quot;
the &quot;sea&quot; (note the pun); nor can it, as Henry puts
it a few lines further, &quot;Listen to the light.&quot;    
<P>
 Such self-consciousness about the use of the medium and the constructedness
of the narrative is the &quot;noise&quot; Beckett introduces into
the channel.  We are warned that the sea sound effects are not
accurate and exhorted to &quot;listen to the light.&quot;  The
&quot;story&quot; is thus immediately established as unreal in
the sense of unverifiable.  If <I>Embers</I> were staged
or televised,  the seashore setting would be so designated, whether
more or less abstractly.  But when sound is our only guide and
the narrator tells us that the sound we hear is &quot;unlike the
sound of the sea,&quot; we cannot be sure where we are.   It follows
that we cannot be wholly involved in Henry's private mental drama.
 The sea, we are told a little bit further along, is the scene
of his father's probable suicide, &quot;the evening bathe you
took once too often.&quot;  But the next sentence tells us that
&quot;We never found your body, you know, that held up probate
an unconscionable time, they said there was nothing to prove you
hadn't run away from us all and alive and well under a false name
in the Argentine for example, that grieved mother greatly. [<I>Pause</I>]&quot;
(E 94).   Indeed, Henry's obsession is not with the sea as such
but only with its <I>sound</I>, which he cannot escape,
even when he tries to &quot;drown it out&quot; by telling himself
endless stories.   &quot;I often went to Switzerland to get away
from the cursed thing,&quot; he recalls,  &quot;and never stopped
all the time I was there.&quot; (E 94).
<P>
 Ada cannot understand why Henry finds the sea's sound so oppressive.
 &quot;It's only on the surface, you know,&quot; she tells Henry,
as if this would comfort him.  &quot;Underneath all is as quiet
as a grave.  Not a sound.  All, day, all night, not a sound. 
[<I>Pause</I>].&quot;  And when Henry explains that he
now walks around with a gramophone so as to drown out the sea,
Ada responds common-sensically, &quot;There is no sense in that.
 [<I>Pause</I>].  There is no sense in trying to drown
it&quot; (E101).  Again, the ironies here are multiple.  The silence
of the sea below the surface, &quot;quiet as a grave,&quot; cannot
comfort Henry who knows that the sea <I>is</I> a grave--his
father's.  And the use of gramophone or voice or rival sounds
to &quot;drown it,&quot; has no chance against the sea's own drowning
power--power brought home to the listener by every sea-sound-filled
pause.  Yet, as Henry says, &quot;It's not so bad when you get
out on it. (E 101).  Again, an ambiguous wish:  it might not be
so bad to &quot;get out on it&quot; because one would no longer
be alive to feel the pain it evokes.
<P>
 No sooner have the acoustics of water been established than Beckett
<P>
introduces its opposite, fire, and the outdoors gives way to the
indoors, as Henry tells the story--a story &quot;never finished
. . . I never finished anything, everything always went on for
ever&quot;-- of &quot;an old fellow called Bolton.&quot;  It begins
as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Bolton [<I>Pause.  Louder</I>]  Bolton! [<I>Pause</I>.]
 There before the fire.  [<I>Pause</I>.]  Before the fire
with all the shutters . . . no, hangings, hangings, all the hangings
drawn and the light, no light, only the light of the fire, sitting
there in the . . . no, standing, standing, there on the hearth-rug
in the dark before the fire in his old red dressing-gown and no
sound in the house of any kind, only the sound of the fire.  [<I>Pause</I>.]
 Standing there in his old red dressing-gown might go on fire
any minute like when he was a child, no, that was his pyjamas,
standing there waiting in the dark, no light, only the light of
the fire, and no sound of any kind, only the fire, an old man
in great trouble.  [<I>Pause</I>.]    (E 95, ellipses are
Beckett's)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The dominant feature here is the degree of verbal and phrasal
repetition: the word &quot;fire&quot; appears eight times in combination
with &quot;light&quot; and &quot;sound,&quot; &quot;only&quot;
and &quot;no,&quot; as in &quot;no light, only the light of the
fire,&quot; &quot;no sound of any kind, only the fire,&quot; and
punctuated by the use of &quot;no&quot; as correction:  &quot;all
the shutters . . . no, hangings,&quot;  &quot;sitting there in
the . . . no, standing.&quot;  &quot;waiting in the dark, no light.&quot;
 And &quot;pause&quot; also acts as a kind of &quot;correction,&quot;
for each pause is filled with the sea voice so that &quot;no sound,&quot;
and &quot;not a sound&quot; are not accurate descriptors.
<P>
 Beckett's dense network of repetition places a curious burden
on the sparsely used visual images in the passage.  So abstract
is the vocabulary, that when we are suddenly introduced to the
figure &quot;on the hearth-rug in the dark before the fire in
his old red dressing-gown,&quot; we hang on to the bright color
image as a kind of signpost in the midst of shadow.  Red is also
the color of the fire, and then the embers, and phonemically both
&quot;red&quot; and &quot;embers&quot; chime with the &quot;Henry,&quot;
who is not overtly present at the scene in question.  
<P>
 But the power of visualization, activated momentarily in Henry's
monologue, is repeatedly countered by rhythm, in this case the
broken phrasal rhythm of &quot;white world, great trouble, not
a sound, only the embers, sound of dying, dying glow, Holloway,
Bolton, Bolton, Holloway, old men, great trouble, white world,
not a sound&quot; (E 95).  The sound structure here, as in many
of Beckett's later works, is phrasal and linear, with two primary
stresses per line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<P>
followed by the chiastic line, &quot;H&oacute;llow&agrave;y, B&oacute;lton
|| B&oacute;lton, H&oacute;llow&agrave;y,&quot; and then the same
refrain with the lines in slightly different order:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>&oacute;ld m&eacute;n</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  wh&iacute;te w&oacute;rld</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  n&oacute;t a so&uacute;nd </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The effect<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>of these elaborately stylized schema
is again to occlude the information channel with noise. The message
from sender to receiver, which radio, practically speaking, is
designed to foreground, becomes progressively less well understood.
 
<P>
 For what is the Bolton story about and how does it relate to
the death by suicide of Henry's father?  John Pilling has complained
that <I>Embers</I> &quot;has a structural slackness deriving
from the two main topics [the father-son plot and the Bolton-Holloway
plot] failing to blend&quot; (PIL 98); Bolton, Pilling posits,
is &quot;simply an image in the  imagination&quot; (PIL100), a
reading that accords with Zilliacus's supposition that Bolton
is somehow Henry's alter ego or Donald Wicher's that he is &quot;the
fictive projection of the self.&quot;  But such thematic readings
slight the piece's use of sound and silence, speech and pause.
 Just as outside, there is no way of &quot;drowning&quot; the
sound of the sea, inside, the only sound is the sound of the fire
and then its embers.  However often Henry tells himself that there
is &quot;not a sound,&quot; whether on the shingle along the beach
or in Bolton's sitting-room, in both cases, sound is steady and
unstoppable. 
<P>
 The only way of interrupting the continuity of water and fire
sounds, it seems, is to introduce another sound, one that is finite
(and hence controllable) rather than continuous.  Thus Henry summons
&quot;Hooves!&quot; in the opening sequence and although the hooves
&quot;<I>die rapidly away</I>,&quot; he longs for a regular
metrical rhythm, a beat that could &quot;mark time. . . . a ten-ton
mammoth back from the dead, shoe it with steel and have it tramp
the world down!  Listen to it!&quot; (E 93).  The parallel in
the Bolton story is the drip:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Holloway, Bolton, Bolton, Holloway, old men, great
trouble, white world, not a sound,  [<I>Pause.</I>]  Listen
to it!  [<I>Pause.</I>]  Close your eyes and listen to
it, what would you think it was?  [<I>Pause.  Vehement.</I>]
 A drip!  A drip!  [<I>Sound of drip, rapidly amplified, suddenly
cut off</I>.]  Again!  [<I>Drip again.  Amplifications
begins</I>.]  No!  [<I>Drip cut off.  Pause</I>.] 
Father!  [<I>Pause.  Agitated</I>.]  Stories, stories,
years and years of stories . . . . (E 95).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Again we have the exhortation &quot;Listen to it!&quot; and the
auditory image of a sound that, unlike the sound of the ocean,
which is present here again in the repeated pauses, can be identified,
timed for frequency, and stopped.  It is when the drip is finally
&quot;cut off&quot; that Henry, supposedly telling a story unconnected
to his family drama, cries out &quot;Father!&quot;  So much for
the unrelatedness of the two narratives.
<P>
 Indeed, the verbal, imagistic, and acoustic symbiosis of the
two &quot;plots&quot; is worked out with musical precision: they
cross in the central sequence of the play which is Henry's dialogue
with Ada, and, by extension, with Addie.  Jonathan Kalb, in the
comment cited above, says Henry and Ada &quot;reminisce about
old times,&quot; but this hardly gives the reader a sense of the
hopelessness and futility that characterizes their exchanges or
the epiphany toward which their desultory conversation moves.
 
<P>
 Ada's vocal entrance follows the snatch of dialogue with Addie,
whose presence, as Henry recalls it, evidently interfered with
his need need to &quot;talk,&quot; to tell himself stories.  Walking
in the fields holding his child's hand in what sounds like a parodic
version of such Wordsworth poems as &quot;We are Seven,&quot;
Henry says, &quot;Run along now, Addie, and look at the lambs.&quot;
 But when she says &quot;No papa,&quot; he turns &quot;<I>Violent</I>&quot;:
 &quot;Go on with you when you're told and look at the lambs!&quot;
which triggers Addie's &quot;<I>loud wail</I>&quot;  (E
96).  Addie's world, a pastoral world of fields, lambs, and the
child Jesus, is one the sea-dweller Henry cannot abide.   And
it is in this context that Ada is remembered:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Ada, too, conversation with her, that was something,
that's what hell will be like, small  chat to the babbling of

now.  [<I>Pause. With solemn </I> <I>indignation</I>.]
 Price of blueband now!  [<I>Pause</I>.]  Father!  [<I>Pause]</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Another water sound-- the  &quot;small chat to the babbling of
Lethe&quot;--that despite its promise to help the narrator forget,
cannot counter the ongoing sound of the sea.  Ada and Addie live
in the mundane, everyday world where the price of margarine or
blueband is the topic of discussion--a world that was, for a short
time, Henry's own, as his  rhyme &quot;Daddy! Addie&quot; (E 100)
suggests.  All the odder, then, that when Ada makes her entrance,
there is, for once, no sound. and further &quot;[<I>No sound
as she sits</I>.]&quot;   For the radio listener she is simply
there; she may indeed have been there all along.
<P>
 The Henry-Ada sequence is not simply flashback, for there are
many time periods covered:  their first love making in the &quot;hole&quot;
&quot;Where we did it at last for the first time&quot; (E 101),
a moment long ago (is that the same moment?) when, as Ada recalls,
&quot;It was rough, the spray came flying over us.  [Pause.] 
Strange it should have been rough then [<I>Pause.</I>]
And calm now&quot; (E 98), Henry and Ada's parental dealings with
their young daughter who takes music and riding lessons, a somewhat
older Ada given to nagging-- &quot;Did you put on your jaegers,
Henry?&quot;(E 97); &quot;Don't wet your good boots&quot; (E 99)--
and then to warning Henry that &quot;You will be quite alone with
your voice, there will be no other voice in the world but yours&quot;
(E 102).  And finally what is evidently the present moment in
which Henry tells Ada, &quot;I was trying to be with my father,&quot;
and she says sardonically, &quot;No difficulty about that.&quot;
 To which Henry responds, &quot;I mean I was trying to get him
to be with me.  [<I>Pause</I>.]  You seem a little cruder
than usual today, Ada&quot; (E102).
<P>
 But so fluid are the shifts from one time frame to another that
there is no use in trying to establish a meaningful temporal sequence.
 When Henry says, in what seems to be the present, &quot;let us
get up and go,&quot; Ada responds, &quot;Go?  Where?  And Addie?
 She would be very distressed if she came and found you had gone
without her&quot; (E 98).  But when, a few minutes later, Henry
asks Ada &quot;What age is [Addie] now?&quot; it is Ada who demurs,
&quot;I have lost count of time&quot; (E 101).   When Henry counters,
&quot;Twelve?  Thirteen?  [<I>Pause.</I>] Fourteen?&quot;,
the audience is even more confused, for Henry and Ada seem to
be talking of a time in the distant past.  Moreover, the one specific
time signal given throws us off even further:  
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>ADA: [<I>Twenty years earlier, imploring</I>.]

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  HENRY: [<I>Ditto.  urgent</I>.]  Darling!</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  HENRY:  [<I>Ditto, exultantly.]</I>  Darling!
 (E 100)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If this<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>prototypical &quot;young love&quot;<FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>scene took place twenty years before the present of the
play, how could Addie now be twelve or thirteen?  Beckett everywhere
underscores the foolishness of such questions.<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>And
the radio medium makes it possible to shift ground at a moment's
notice and to collapse time.  Past and present are often indistiguishable,
even as sound distinctions are rigidly maintained:  sea-sound
versus &quot;hooves&quot; in the first sequence, &quot;drip&quot;
in the second, and finally the dashing together of stones in the
third.  When Ada insists that &quot;there's nothing wrong with
it [the sound of the sea], it's a lovely peaceful gentle soothing
sound,&quot; Henry goes wild: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Thuds, I want thuds!  Like this! [<I>He fumbles
in the shingle, catches up two big stones and starts dashing them
together</I>.]  Stone!  [<I>Clash</I>.] Stone!  [<I>Clash</I>.
 <I>'Stone!' and clash amplified, cut off.  Pause He throws
one stone away.  Sound of its fall.</I>]  That's l<I>ife
[He throws the other stone away.  Sound of its fall</I>.]
 Not this. . . [<I>Pause</I>] . . . sucking!&quot; (E 100,
ellipses Beckett's).  </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The sound of stone falling <I>stops</I>, whereas the sea's
&quot;sucking&quot; continues<FONT SIZE=2>.  </FONT>&quot;Sucking,&quot;
with its harsh spirant and voiceless stop,  now extracts Ada's
monologue which is, from the point of view of plot, the key to
the play, providing, as it does, the crucial information Henry
has sought all along.   The climactic scene in question begins
with Henry's challenge: &quot;I can't remember if he [Father]
met you,&quot; and Ada's immediate reply, &quot;You know he met
me&quot; (E 102).  Henry demurs:  &quot;No, Ada, I don't know,
I'm sorry.  I have forgotten almost everything connected with
you.&quot;   Now comes the following dialogue:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>ADA:     You weren't there.  Just your mother and
sister.  I had called  to fetch you, as    arranged.  We were
to go bathing together. [<I>Pause</I>.]</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> HENRY:    [<I>Irritably.</I>]  Drive on,
drive on!  Why do people always stop in the middle of    what
they are saying?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> ADA:    None of them knew where you were.  Your
bed had not been slept in.  They    were all shouting at one another.
 Your sister said she would throw herself off the   cliff.  Your
father got up and went out, slamming the door.  I left soon afterwards
     and passed him on the road.  He did not see me.  He was sitting
on a rock looking     out to sea.   I never forgot his posture.
 And yet it was a common one.  You used to      have it sometimes.
 Perhaps just the stillness, as if he had been turned to stone.
       I could never make it out.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   [<I>Pause</I>.]</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> HENRY:      Keep on!  keep on!  [<I>Imploringly</I>.]
 Keep it going, Ada, every syllable is a    second gained.   (E
102)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Ada cannot remember anything else but she insists that &quot;there
are attitudes remain in one's mind for reasons that are clear&quot;
(E 103) and that she cannot forget &quot;the great stillness of
the whole body, as if all the breath had left it&quot; (E 103).
 It remains for Henry to finish Ada's story for her:  she sees,
or so Henry imagines it, the old man sitting on the rock but keeps
on toward the tram stop, gets on the next tram into town but feels
&quot;uneasy,&quot; and gets off again.  She retraces her steps:
 &quot;Very unhappy and uneasy, hangs round a bit, not a soul
about, cold wind coming in off sea, goes back down path and takes
tram home&quot; (E103).  
<P>
 The critics have made very little of this whole sequence.  &quot;When
Ada leaves Henry's mind,&quot; writes Cohn, &quot;he tries to
weave a story about her encounter with his father, but Ada 'takes
tram home,' and Henry drops her&quot; (RCJP 84).  But then why
is this the only moment in the play when Henry urges Ada to &quot;drive
on!,&quot; &quot;keep on!&quot;?  That  &quot;Every syllable is
a second gained&quot;?  Note that for the first time it is revealed
that Ada was the last person to have seen Henry's father alive.
 It is she who witnessed the scene at Henry's house when &quot;they
were all shouting at one another.  Your sister said she would
throw herself off the cliff.&quot;   She who knows that Henry's
&quot;bed had not been slept in.&quot;  And it is after the scene
she witnesses--&quot;your father got up and went out, slamming
the door&quot;-- that she sees his figure &quot;turned to stone&quot;
on the rock overlooking the sea.&quot;  There is something so
wrong with this picture that, having boarded her tram home, she
gets off again and returns to the scene of the crime.  But now
there is &quot;not a soul about.&quot;
<P>
 This is the &quot;message&quot; Ada relays to Henry but what
does it mean? Evidently father and son had had a quarrel-- &quot;Your
bed had not been slept in&quot;--evidently something terrible
has happened, but what?  What would make the sister threaten to
throw herself off a cliff?  Why is everyone shouting?  Why does
the father go out, slamming the door?  What drives him to drown
himself?  Why is the body, in a detail perfectly suited to radio,
&quot;never found&quot;?  Henry evidently knows some or all of
these things, which is why he cannot drown out the voice of the
sea.  When Ada retells her tale, a tale she herself doesn't understand,
his sense of guilt reaches fever pitch.  If Ada could only remember
more!   &quot;Every syllable is a second gained.&quot;
<P>
 The Bolton story, far from being unrelated, provides the clue.
 Bolton has summoned Dr. Holloway, an old family friend, to help
him in some desperate venture.  Holloway finally offers to give
his old friend  a shot, but Bolton wants something else that Holloway
won't give him:  &quot;We've had this before, Bolton, don't ask
me to go through it again&quot;  (104).  Does Bolton want Holloway
to perform euthanasia?  Or perhaps, given Ada's reference to Henry's
sister's threat, an abortion?  Or some other act of mercy?  There
is no way of knowing what Bolton's &quot;Please!  PLEASE!&quot;
refers to except that it is evidently something Holloway might
dispense from his little black bag.   The turning point, in any
case,  comes after the third &quot;Please, Holloway!&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Candle shaking and guttering all over the place,
lower now, old arm tired, takes it in the other hand and holds
it high again, that's it, that was always it, night, and the embers
cold, and the glim shaking in your old fist, saying, &quot;Please!
Please!  [<I>Pause</I>.]  Begging.  [<I>Pause</I>.]
 Of the poor. <I>[Pause</I>.]  Ada!  [Pause.]  Father!
 [Pause.]  Christ! [<I>Pause!</I>.]  (E 104)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &quot;<I>Your</I> old fist&quot;:  with the sudden and
startling shift from third to second person, the text suddenly
opens up.  For who is Bolton but the father now immediately invoked
in the sequence &quot;Ada!,&quot; &quot;Father!,&quot; &quot;Christ!,&quot;
each appelation punctuated by a pause bearing the sound of the
sea?  Far from being a projection of Henry's imagination, or Henry's
alter ego,  Bolton stands in for the father who, having failed
in his unspecified and final plea to Holloway (&quot;Please! 
PLEASE!&quot;), takes his own life.  And it is Henry who, for
reasons never made wholly clear, cannot stop feeling he is to
blame.  No removal to Switzerland, no memories of &quot;normal&quot;
family life, no retelling of Ada's uncomprehending story of what
happened the fatal day of his father's death, no invocation of
horses hooves' marking time, of water dripping, of stones struck
together with a loud grinding sound, can drown out the sea's endless
sounding.
<P>
 What is perhaps the key word linking the two narratives in <I>Embers</I>
is the word &quot;washout,&quot; which appears in Henry's opening
monologue.   He has just gone over the Bolton-Holloway story for
the first time and has recounted Holloway's refusal to do what
Bolton wants:  &quot;ghastly scene, wishes to God he hadn't come,
no good, fire out, bitter cold, great trouble, white world, not
a sound, no good.  [<I>Pause</I>.]&quot;   At this point,
&quot;No good&quot; is repeated, now referring back to Henry himself:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>No good.  [<I>Pause</I>.]  Can't do it.  [<I>Pause.]
 </I>Listen to it! [<I>Pause</I>].  Father!  [<I>Pause</I>.]
 You wouldn't know me now, you'd be sorry you ever had me, but
you were that already a washout that's the last I heard from you,
a washout.  [<I>Pause.  Imitating father's voice</I>.]</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>'Are you coming for a dip?'  'No.'  'Come on, come
on.'  'No.'  Glare, stump to door, turn, glare.  'A washout that's
all you are, a washout!'  [<I>Violent slam of door.  Pause</I>.]
 Again!  [<I>Slam.  Pause</I>.] Slam life shut like that!
 [Pause.] Washout.  [<I>Pause</I>.] Wish to Christ she
had.  (E 96)</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The terrible irony here is that if Henry is figuratively a &quot;washout,&quot;
his father is literally one.   But &quot;washout&quot; also refers
to Henry's own death wish, his wish never to have been born coupled
with his wish that he himself had never become Addie's father:
&quot;horrid little creature, wish to God we'd never had her&quot;
(E 96).   An important intertext here is Beckett's late prose
composition <I>Company</I>, specifically the following
childhood memory:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=2>You stand at the tip of the high board.  High above
the sea.  In it your father's upturned face. Upturned to you.
 You look down to the loved trusted face.  He calls you to jump.
 He calls, be a brave boy.  The red round face.  The thick moustahce.
 The greying hair.  The swell sways it under and sways it up again.
 The far call again.  Be a brave boy.  Many eyes upon you.  From
the water and from the bathing place.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The reference here, as James Knowlson notes in his biography,
is to the &quot;famous deep 'Gentlemen Only' Forty-Foot&quot;
into which Bill Beckett, a superb swimmer, enjoyed diving from
the high rocks at Sandycove when his son Sam was small (JKDF 32).
  In <I>Beckett Writing Beckett</I>, H. Porter Abbott rightly
points out that the scene in question is of &quot;an action that
does not take place--no jump occurs&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>   Nor, and this is equally important, is it the
record of a refusal to jump (nothing in the scene indicates such
a construction either).  It is the not-taking-place of a following
a father's command.  It is the not-taking-on of an identity (&quot;<I>Be</I>
a brave boy&quot;).  It is the nonoccurence of a baptism of total
immersion with a father before the witness of many (&quot;Many
eyes upon you&quot;). </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
For Abbott, it is thus an example of Beckett's  characteristic
&quot;Unwriting [of] The Father&quot; (BWB 11), his intentional
&quot;sealing&quot; of central autobiographical moments--his own
Wordsworthian &quot;spots of time&quot;--&quot;from meaningful,
sequential narrative connection with any of the other spots in
<I>Company</I> (BWB 17).  
<P>
 Abbott convincingly separates Beckett's &quot;autography&quot;
from full-fledged autobiography on the one hand, fiction on the
other.   <I>Company</I>, one might add, works more like
a lyric poem than any kind of narrative, and the diving incident
cited above is best understood in relation to another scene just
a few pages earlier in the text, in which the author's father
sets off on a mountain hike so as to avoid &quot;the pains and
general unpleasantness of [his wife's] labour and delivery,&quot;
 the delivery being Beckett's own. The father's urge is to get
away:  &quot;Hence the sandwiches which he relished at noon looking
out to sea from the lee of a great rock on the first summit scaled&quot;
 (C 13).   The father who absents himself for the moment of his
son's birth is not unlike the father of <I>Embers</I>,
whose posture on a similar rock above the sea provides the death
motif.   And the son who cannot respond properly to the loved
father's request to &quot;Be a brave boy,&quot; and to &quot;jump,&quot;
is forever a &quot;washout.&quot;
<P>
 Knowlson records how devastated the twenty-seven-year old Beckett
was when his father died in 1933.  It happened during the worst
period of Beckett's life--the inability to leave home or to find
a viable form of writing, the heavy drinking, the terrible fights
with his mother.  But his father, who made few demands on his
son, was &quot;a great source of strength to him&quot; (JKDF 164).
  As Beckett wrote his friend Tom MacGreevy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>Lovely walk this morning with Father, who grows old
with a very graceful philosophy.  Comparing bees and butterflies
to elephants and parrots and speaking of indentures with the Leveller!
 Barging through hedges and over the walls with the help of my
shoulder, blaspheming and stopping to rest under colour of admiring
the view.  I'll never have anyone like him.  (cited in JKDF 165).
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It was just a few months later that Bill Beckett collapsed with
a heart attack: within a week he was dead.  &quot;I can't write
about him,&quot; Beckett wrote MacGreevy, &quot;I can only walk
the fields and climb the ditches after him&quot; (JKDF 166), and
more than fifty years later, he told his biographer: &quot;After
my father's death I had trouble psychologically.  The bad years
were between when I had to crawl home in 1932 and after my father's
death in 1933.  I'll tell you how it was.  I was walking down
Dawson Street.  And I felt I couldn't go on.  It was a strange
experience I can't really describe.  I found I couldn't go on
moving&quot; (JKDF 167).
<P>
 The acute sense of guilt that produced this paralysis is not
surprising when we consider that, at the time of his death, Beckett
<I>p&egrave;re </I>could not know that his son would ever
emerge from the bad phase he was in, a phase that gave his mother
so much pain.  And it is the son's guilt about this situation
which is the subject of <I>Embers</I>.  The sea-sound is
forever linked to the dying embers, white world, and &quot;no
sound&quot; that greets Bolton's &quot;Please!  PLEASE!&quot;
 Beckett has written a searing play about what Dante called the
&quot;great refusal.&quot;
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Information, Please <BR>
</B>

<P>
 The question remains:  what did Beckett gain by presenting this
autobiographical drama of filial guilt as a <I>radio</I>
play?  If, as we have seen, <I>Embers</I> is closely allied
to such of Beckett's later fictions as <I>Company</I>,
which shares many of its actual images and incidents (and a similar
case could be made for <I>Krapp's Last Tape</I> and <I>The
Unnamable</I>, both of them written just a few years before
<I>Embers</I>), why was Beckett so adamant in refusing
to let his plays &quot;for voices, not bodies,&quot; be staged
or so much as read in front of a live audience?   Why his insistence
that &quot;to 'act' it is to kill it&quot;?   
<P>
 The answer cannot be that radio gave Beckett the best possible
vehicle for &quot;skullscape&quot; or &quot;soulscape,&quot; for
certainly <I>Company</I> and <I>Krapp's Last Tape</I>
are soulscapes too.  Nor is it enough to say, as Beckett does
of his radio plays, that the &quot;whole thing <I>com[es] out
of the dark</I>.&quot;   Rather, I would like to suggest that
the &quot;radio-activity&quot; of <I>Embers</I>, as of
<I>Words and Music</I>, <I>Cascando,</I> and <I>Rough
for Radio</I> <I>I</I> and <I>II</I> which followed
in its wake, is that its sounding of disembodied voices makes
it the perfect vehicle for the dance of death that is its subject.
 The dialectic of sea-sound / no sound, within which the sound
of hooves, of a water drip, of stones grinding against one another
cannot &quot;drown&quot; the continuity of the sea without and
the fire within, is the vocal equivalent of a world in which all
the characters--Ada, Addie, Henry's father, Bolton, Holloway,
and Henry himself--are revenants, ghostly presences.  When Ada
tells Henry he &quot;ought to see Holloway,&quot; she adds, &quot;he's
alive still, isn't he?&quot; (E 100).  But alive at which of the
many discrepant times presented in this play?  The Holloway we
meet in Henry's monologue is an old man who says to the equally
old Bolton, &quot;for the love of God, Bolton, do you want to
finish me?&quot; (E 104).  As for Henry himself, his living testimony
exists, as it were, <I>in absentia:</I> his self, as Charles
Grivel puts it in the passage that gives me my epigraph, lives
<I>without him</I>.
<P>
 At the same time-- and this is the paradox--<I>Embers</I>
is an exciting whodunnit.   Inevitably, the audience tries to
construct the plot, doled out in dribs and drabs of information.
 Why is Henry so obsessed with his father?  How did the father
feel about Ada?  What, if any, role did she play in his death?
 What does Bolton want from Holloway and why won't Holloway give
it to him?  And so on.  Normally and conventionally, radio is
the purveyor of messages:  who killed whom and why?  when and
where did it happen?  what are the latest police findings?  What
does the coroner's report say?  But in <I>Embers</I>, there
are no findings, no announcement, no &quot;late bulletin.&quot;
 Indeed, it is these features of radio discourse that Beckett
parodies: the radio audience's demand for fact is consistently
undercut by verbal and phrasal repetition, by unanchored visual
image (e.g., red dressinggown, blue eye), and by rhetorical and
sonic excess.  
<P>
 So stylized is the play's language, with its invocation of seemingly
unrelated sounds and sights, that we all but miss the moment when
disclosure actually occurs, when the noise dies down for an instant,
allowing a bit of the &quot;message&quot; to come through.  That
moment occurs when Ada recounts her visit to the house where &quot;None
of them knew where you were.  Your bed had not been slept in.&quot;
 Her speech is significantly framed by Henry's &quot;Drive on,
drive on!  Why do people always stop in the middle of what they
are saying?&quot; and &quot;Keep on, keep on! [<I>Imploringly</I>.]
(E 102).   When Ada stops, unable to remember anything else, Henry
has to finish the story for her, a story that imperceptibly and
inevitably modulates back into the Bolton narrative.   And the
narrator repeats the words, &quot;Not a word, just the look, the
old blue eye&quot; (E 104).  
<P>
 But if there is &quot;Not a word, just a look,&quot; the radio
narrative is over. &quot;Every syllable&quot; is indeed &quot;a
second gained,&quot; for if there is really no sound, the listener
must assume that the receiver isn't working, that there is either
failure in the particular channel of transmission or a mechanical
failure that has somehow turned off the set.  On radio, in other
words, the only way to simulate silence is via sound.  And it
is this characteristic of the medium Beckett must have had in
mind when he refused to allow his radio plays to be <I>visualized</I>
in any form.
<P>
 In a recent internet debate of the John Cage Discussion Group,
 participants were discussing how to perform Cage's famous &quot;silent&quot;
piece of 1952 called <I>4'  33</I>&quot;.  The title refers
to the four minutes and thirty-three second length of the performance,
designed for any instrument or combination of instruments, which
are, in fact, not played during the &quot;silent&quot; performance.
  Daniel Farris suggests:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>When one records silence, one must make a number
of decisions.  As when recording sound,  one must decide whether
or not to mic it up close or at a distance.  The purpose of close
mic placement is to reduce the amount of intrusion caused by nearby
instruments and ambient sound and not necessarily to capture the
most accurate representation of the performance.   The purpose
of distance mic placement is to capture the complete sonic environment
both completely and accurately.  Both techniques are useful and
the decision about which to use is a subjective but important
one. . . . Given the average Western audience's predisposition
toward movement and respiration (and occasionally more at a hot
gig), if an audience were present, one would need to actually
deploy microphones  and roll tape.  We could call this 'the live
version.'</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here Farris reminds us that silence is never in fact, silent:
to record it for radio or audiotape therefore presents special
problems.  On stage or in film, &quot;silence&quot; is represented
by having some sort of visual movement (as in Beckett's own <I>Film</I>)
during which nothing is &quot;said.&quot;  But on radio, there
is no such option and so &quot;silence&quot; must be sounded as
it is in <I>Embers</I>.  The final sentence in the play,
&quot;Not a sound,&quot; thus denies its own assertion in ways
that underscore the piece's overarching sense of emptiness.  
For Henry can't even have the silence he longs for and anticipates;
there will always be another &quot;syllable,&quot; but not the
one he is looking for.  Radio would seem to be a unique medium
to achieve this particular pathos.  <BR>

10 <FONT SIZE=2> The designation &quot;skullscape&quot; is Linda
Ben Zvi's, &quot;soulscape&quot; is Ruby Cohn's, both in the recorded
discussion that follows the production of <U>Embers</U> for the
Beckett Festival of Radio Plays, recorded at the BBC Studios,
London on January 1988.  The director/producer for <U>Embers</U>
 was Everett Frost, the Associate Producer, Faith Wilding, the
Project Originator Martha Fehsenfeld.  In the BBC production,
Barry McGovern played Henry, Billie Whitelaw played Ada, Michael
Deacon was the Riding Master / Music Master, Tika Viker-Bloss
was Addie, and Henry Strozier, the host for the production.  National
Public Radio broadcast the five-part series of radio plays on
Beckett's birthday, April 13, 1989.  The Beckett Festival cassettes
are available from the Pacifica Radio Archive (818-506-1077).

11 <FONT SIZE=2> For Cohn's analysis of <U>Embers</U>, see also her
<U>Just Play: Beckett's Theater</U> (Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1980), pp. 84-86.  <U>Embers</U>, writes Cohn, &quot;is
a paradigm of most of Beckett's subsequent author-character combinations.
 Set in a human mind, spare of referential content, dramatic stories
condense toward incantation&quot; (p. 86).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
12 <FONT SIZE=2>Although even at this level, there are problems.
Kalb says, for example, that Henry &quot;may or may not be walking
by the sea with his daughter Addie nearby,&quot; thus ignoring
the complex time shifts:  in the present of the play's opening,
Addie has long been dead.  Kalb also refers oddly to Ada as Henry's
&quot;companion&quot; rather than, what she so evidently is, his
wife, and the two, as I will suggest later,  by no means merely
&quot;reminisce about old times.&quot;<BR>

16 <FONT SIZE=2>E 93.  Although my reading here and throughout is
based on the Becckett Festival recording in conjunction with the
text, I use the text as score, since Beckett indicates what the
quality of voice is meant to be.  Such scoring has its problems;
it is not quite true to the actual experience of hearing a work
a single time (or even several times) on the air.  Following Beckett's
written text allows me to reread, reconsider, compare passages
in nonlinear ways.  But since presumably Beckett would have wanted
us to study a given recording, not just listen to it once, the
use of text as score, in conjunction with the recording, is not,
I hope,  a violation of his purpose.<BR>

18 <FONT SIZE=2> CZ 85.  Zilliacus argues that the Henry-Bolton parallel
is more convincing than the father-Bolton one, &quot;because it
leaves the play more coherent. . . . Henry's father, whether he
committed suicide or not, found a way out: his story has been
finished.  Henry, like Bolton, has to go on: the Bolston story
is doomed to remain unfinished because Henry himself is not finished.&quot;
