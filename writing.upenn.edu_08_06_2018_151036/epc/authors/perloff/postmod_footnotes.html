  the Present in American Poetry,&quot; <I>boundary 2</I>: <I>a journal of
  postmodern literature</I>, 1, 1 (Fall 1972): 98-133, see pp. 98-99, 109-12.

  <P><A NAME="4"></A><B>4.</B> Ihab Hassan, &quot;POSTmodernISM: A Paracritical
  Bibliography,&quot; <I>New Literary History</I>, 3, no. 1 (Fall 1971);
  rpt. <I>Paracriticisms: Seven Speculations of the Times</I> (Urbana: University
  of Illinois Press, 1975), and <I>The Postmodern Turn: Essays in Postmodern
  Theory and Culture</I> (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1987), pp.
  25-45. All subsequent references are to this collection, cited IHPT. Hassan
  lists 7 rather than 9 categories because three (elitism, irony, abstraction)
  are subsumed under &quot;Dehumanization.&quot; For purposes of clarity,
  I have thought it best to break this unit up, since the subsections get
  as much attention as the other sections.</P>
  <P>A related essay, &quot;The New Gnosticism: Speculations on an Aspect
  of the Postmodern Mind&quot; appears in <I>boundary 2, 1, no. 3 </I>(Spring
  1973): 547-69. </P>

  Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984), pp. xxiv-xxv,
  3-8, and esp. 31-37. Interestingly, the blurb for the Minnesota edition
  was written by Ihab Hassan.</P>

  Logic of Late Capitalism</I> (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1991),

  1991): 3-4. </P>
  <P>But cf. Stephen Connor, <I>Postmodern Culture: An Introduction to Theories
  of the Contemporary</I> (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1989). Connor puts his
  finger on the difficulty of making definitive statements about postmodernism,
  which is supposedly so undefined and open. Referring to Foucault's account
  in <I>The Order of Things </I>of Borges's Chinese encyclopedia as a&quot;structure
  of radical incommensurability&quot; or &quot;heterotopia,&quot; Connor
  comments: &quot;The obvious problem ... which Foucault does not here confront,
  is that, once such a heterotopia has been named, and, more especially,
  once it has been cited and re-cited, it is no longer this conceptual monstrosity
  which it once was, for its incommensurability has been in some sense bound,
  controlled and predictively interpreted, given a centre and illustrative
  function.&quot; In this sense, postmodern theory regularly &quot;names
  and correspondingly closes off the very world of cultural difference and
  plurality which it allegedly brings to visibility. What is striking is
  precisely the degree of consensus in postmodernist discourse that there
  is no longer any possibility of consensus, the authoritative announcements
  of the disappearance of final authority, and the promotion and recirculation
  of a total and comprehensive narrative of a cultural condition in which
  totality is no longer thinkable&quot; (pp. 9-10).</P>

  in which the voiceover becomes a caption, see Laurie Anderson, <I>United
  States</I> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1984), Part One, unpaginated. Craig
  Owens's reference is to the earlier version in <I>Americans On the Move</I>,
  in which the wording is slightly different. See Owens, &quot;The Discourse
  of Others: Feminists and Postmodernism&quot; in <I>The Anti-Aesthetic:
  Essays on Postmodern Culture, </I>ed. Hal Foster (Port Townsend, WA: Bay
  Press, 1983), p. 60; subsequently cited in the text as AA. </P>

  <P><A NAME="10"></A><B>10.</B> When Owens does briefly mention Luce Irigaray,
