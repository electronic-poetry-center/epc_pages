<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0718FC" SIZE=+1>Grub Street and the Ivory Tower:</font> as my fellow essayists have so elegantly
  demonstrated, the worlds of literary journalism and literary scholarship
  have been, for at least the past two centuries, much more closely allied
  than is commonly thought. But what about the third term in the equation,
  the <I>literary</I> itself? Specifically--and this is my subject here--how
  does &quot;literary journalism&quot; confront the poetry written in its
  own time, along with the scholarly reception and theorization of that poetry?
  <BR>
  <BR>
  Writing about poetry and poetics has, for a long time now, occupied an
  anomalous place in the larger humanistic discourse in which it is, after
  all, embedded. Take, for example, two long reviews that appeared just a
  few months apart in the <I>Times Literary Supplement</I>. The first is
  Richard Sennett's review of four books on contemporary architectural theory
  (18 September 1992, pp. 3-4), the second Glyn Maxwell's review of eight
  books on contemporary poetics (29 January 1993, pp. 9-10).<BR>
  <BR>
  Richard Sennett is a well-known social critic (currently professor of sociology
  and humanities at New York University) whose most recent book <I>The Conscience
  of the Eye</I> (1991) is subtitled <I>The Design and Social Life of Cities</I>.
  The books under review in this, a special issue on &quot;Cities&quot;,
  which also features articles by Gavin Stamp, David Rieff, and Saskia Sassen,
  are Jean-Louis Cohen's <I>Le Corbusier and the Mystique of the USSR: Theories
  and Projects for Moscow</I>, 1928-<I>1936</I> (Princeton, 1991), Robert
  Harbison's <I>The Built, the Unbuilt, and </I>the Unbuildable (Thames and
  Hudson, 1992), Beatriz Colomina's collection, <I>Sexuality and Space</I>
  (Princeton, 1992), and Anthony Vidler's <I>The Architectural Uncanny</I>
  (MIT, 1992). Sennett writes about these books as an informed insider: he
  has himself been active in the symposia held at the Princeton University
  School of Architecture, where some of the material in question has been
  aired. He takes it as a given that urban spaces are now largely disaster
  areas but argues that architects are neither to blame for this state of
  affairs nor can they be expected to come up with blueprints for some kind
  of Utopian renewal. Rather, he suggests, in sympathy with the theorists
  under review, what is needed at the moment is perhaps a better understanding
  of how these spaces actually work, how buildings, streets, and open spaces
  relate to the human body.<BR>
  <BR>
  Cohen's book on Le Corbusier supplies Sennett with his historical frame,
  for it details the great architect's design for the proposed Palace of
  the Soviets in Moscow, a design based on the attempt to integrate inside
  and outside, built from to its surrounding space so as to downplay ceremony
  and create a truly popular architecture. The rejection of the plan by the
  authorities in 1932 &quot;in favour of a standard-issue monument in neo-Palladian
  style by Zhotovsky&quot; is taken, both by Cohen and by Sennett, as emblematic
  of the aporias of trying to invent a genuinely &quot;popular&quot; form
  of architecture. Perhaps, then, as Robert Harbison and the contributors
  to <I>Sexuality and Space</I> argue, the best that buildings can do is
  to create what Harbison calls &quot;fictions of value.&quot; Harbison &quot;sees
  the experience of industrial ruin as inviting a radically innovative response&quot;;
  in the case of Richard Rogers's Lloyds Building, for example, the elaborate
  &quot;mock-ruins&quot;, unexpectedly built from steel and glass, have a
  curious way of altering our sense of time. And Anthony Vidler's <I>Architectural
  Uncanny</I> (a book that has since become celebrated in discussions of
  the postmodern arts) carries this notion one step further. To counter the
  deadness of contemporary neutralized urban spaces, Vidler suggests, one
  must open oneself to the &quot;uncanny&quot; of crossings, must try to
  open up the suburb, the strip, the urban centre to one another and see
  what their intersection will produce. Loss, dislocation, invasion: these
  become positive values.<BR>
  <BR>
  Another reviewer might have been less sympathetic to his subjects than
  is Sennett, but I think most readers would agree that his is an interesting,
  sophisticated, well-informed review that helps a non-professional reader
  like myself to understand what's going on in recent urban theory. And Sennett's
  knowledge of the social context, his own participation in the debate on
  what to do with urban spaces, makes him an excellent expositor.<BR>
  <BR>
  Glyn Maxwell sees his role rather differently. The books that he was assigned
  to review are, in all fairness, as curious an assortment of apples and
  oranges as one can imagine. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#1" TARGET="resource window">1</A>)</FONT> First,
  two critical studies of of established poets: <I>The Art of Derek Walcott</I>,
  a collection of essays edited by Stuart Brown (Seren, 1989) and James Booth's
  monograph <I>Philip Larkin, Writer</I> (Harvester, 1992). Next, a biography,
  A. T. Tolley's, <I>My Proper Ground: A Study of the Work of Philip Larkin
  and its Development</I> (Edinburgh, 1992). These three are followed by
  three more theoretical works: Linda Reinfeld's <I>Language Poetry: Writing
  as Rescue</I> (Louisiana, 1992), Charles Bernstein's <I>A Poetics</I> (Harvard,
  1992), and Anthony Easthope and John O. Thompson's <I>Contemporary Poetry
  Meets Modern Theory</I> (Harvester, 1991). These three books are related:
  the poet Charles Bernstein's manifestos, theoretical prose poems, and cultural
  explorations collected in <I>A Poetics</I> stand behind Linda Reinfeld's
  analytical history of the Language Poetry movement in the U.S. and Easthope
  and Thompson, for their part, have brought together a variety of critics
  who hold the common view that the more radical poetries today have much
  in common with poststructuralist theory. The three, in any case, have nothing
  in common with the Walcott and Larkin studies on the one hand or with Robert
  Pack's <I>The Long View: Essays on the Discipline of Hope and Poetic Craft</I>
  (Massachusetts, 1991), on the other. Pack is an American poet who has been
  around for a long time and is best known as an anthologist. His essays
  are avowedly personal, impressionistic, and casual. Finally, the review
  includes a study of Emersonian-Jamesian poetics by one of the distinguished
  academic critics in the U.S., Richard Poirier. His book is called <I>Poetry
  and Pragmatism</I> (Faber, 1992).<BR>
  <BR>
  Unlike the four books reviewed by Sennett, which are closely related, both
  historically and ideologically, Maxwell's list thus has no rationale, except
  that somehow all eight books (published, incidentally, over a four-year
  period) have some bearing on contemporary poetry, whatever that is. One
  should note that Maxwell is given some four columns to cover eight books,
  as against the six columns allotted to Sennett. More important: whereas
  Sennett is on a par with the authors he reviews, having written comparable
  books and essays as a fellow-worker in the field, Maxwell has been assigned
  this review in his capacity, not as poetry critic or scholar or theorist,
  but as a poet. Indeed, it has become increasingly common, in literary journalism,
  for theoretical and historical studies of poetry, like Reinfeld's and Poirier's,
  to be reviewed (when they are reviewed at all) by certified poets. (A certified
  poet is one who has published a book or two of poems with a mainstream
  publisher and has received a few respectful reviews in the mainstream press).
  The parallel, in the case of the architecture books, would be to have an
  architect, perhaps a partner in a respected firm that specializes in office
  buildings on Park Avenue or in suburban tract housing, review Anthony Vidler's
  <I>Architectural Uncanny</I>. <BR>
  <BR>
  Maxwell begins with a set of assumptions: (1) the &quot;great poem&quot;
  induce[s] strong, conflicting emotions in every reader who reads it in
  its language; (2) &quot;it is always instantly memorized&quot;; (3) once
  its author is dead, it quickly gets overinterpreted, has meanings read
  into it, and a myth of its author comes into being that threatens to displace
  the &quot;authentic&quot; poet who wrote it; (4) &quot;Poets know what
  is worth saying about other poets&quot;; and (5) the concept of &quot;schools&quot;
  is &quot;especially unhelpful.&quot; All these theorems are put before
  us as if they were simply a matter of common-sense, even though critical
  theory of the past half century has dismantled, step by step, the notion
  of the authentic <I>ur-poem</I>, destroyed by later misreadings, the poem
  as catharsis of &quot;conflicting emotions&quot; (shades of I. A. Richards!),
  best understood by other poets. As for the memorability criterion, which
  Maxwell puts forward as if it were the second law of thermodynamics, this
  criterion allows for neither free verse (hard to memorize!), nor prose
  poetry or visual poetries--all of them very prominent and exciting today.
  Memorability depends, of course, on rhyme and meter; it's much easier to
  memorize <I>Don Juan than</I> <I>The Prelude</I>, Emily Dickinson's short
  hymn stanzas than Whitman's long poems, Robert Frost than William Carlos
  Williams. And how would one &quot;memorize&quot; Ian Hamilton Finlay's
  poetic compositions? Or Susan Howe's?<BR>
  <BR>
  Maxwell doesn't worry about such thorny issues. He knows what he likes
  and the books on Walcott and Larkin are deemed worthy, not because their
  contributors are doing anything special, but because Walcott and Larkin
  are worthy. The reviewer doesn't worry much about them, nor about Pack
  and Poirier (the latter gets rather short shrift), his witty barbs being
  reserved for the so-called language poets discussed by Linda Reinfeld,
  by some of Anthony Easthope's contributors, and by Charles Bernstein, himself
  one of the founders of the movement. Maxwell doesn't like the concept of
  the movement or school, which animates Reinfeld's discussion of language
  poetry, but he never bothers to investigate if the poets in question--Bernstein,
  Howe, Michael Palmer, Lyn Hejinian, Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman-- do,
  in fact, constitute one. Never mind: the main thing is that these, to Maxwell,
  self-evidently worthless poets continue to write about each other &quot;long
  after the magazine that gave them their name [<I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]</I> has
  disappeared, along with any likelihood of anyone else taking an interest.&quot;
  And further: theirs is a poetry of &quot;complete and deliberate impenetrability&quot;,
  a poetry that &quot;jettison[s] the notion that language can communicate.&quot;
  The twin goals of poetry--to teach and to delight--are thus totally violated.<BR>
  <BR>
  Richard Sennett, you will recall, is himself engaged in the discourse about
  the future of urban spaces which preoccupies his authors; he writes as
  a critical but sympathetic insider. Glyn Maxwell has no such commitment
  to his subjects. On the contrary, he gives no evidence that he has ever
  <I>read</I> a single poem by Charles Bernstein or the other poets Reinfeld
  discusses; indeed, it is doubtful that he has so much as looked at <I>A
  Poetics</I>, since Bernstein's arguments are cited only from Reinfeld's
  book, as if her account, which is after all an interpretation of Bernstein's
  theory, were simply equivalent to it. As for the Easthope-Thompson volume,
  I can testify to the fact that he hasn't read my own essay in that collection,
  of which he writes, &quot;Elsewhere, Marjorie Perloff celebrates the brick
  wall of Steve McCaffery's work by invoking Ezra Pound- odd how these radical,
  dethroning writers will gulp whole the dicta ('Make it new!') of an old
  apologist for fascism.&quot; Period. My essay on McCaffery's <I>Lag</I>
  never mentions Pound's name nor do I say anything in it about &quot;Make
  it new!&quot; But even if I did, the assumption that a Pound echo in McCaffery
  would somehow link this poet to fascism takes one's breath away. And, incidentally,
  how and why is McCaffery's poem a &quot;brick wall&quot;? Is it enough
  merely to so pronounce?<BR>
  <BR>
  Maxwell's is thus a review that blithely ignores the facts, not to mention
  the poetic principles involved. The reviewer's assertion that &quot;no
  one&quot; takes an interest in the language poetry movement is belied by
  so many articles, books, and symposia, not only in the <B>U.S</B>. but
  also in the <B>U.K</B>. (as in France, China, Japan, and Australia) that
  the statement hardly warrants serious rebuttal. Indeed, this review would
  hardly be worth talking about, were it not so typical. For the fact is
  that whereas <B>TLS</B> reviews of books on architectural theory, on feminist
  studies, on the Elizabethan theatre, or on philosophy (in the same issue,
  Arthur Danto has a brilliant, excoriating piece on Charles Taylor's <I>Ethics</I>
  <I>of Authenticity</I>) are, I would contend, largely responsible pieces,
  written by experts in their various fields, journalistic discourse about
  contemporary poetry (perhaps about contemporary literary forms in general)
  is largely impressionistic, uninformed, and philistine. And the <I>TLS</I>
  is by no means the worst offender.<BR>
  <BR>
  Here, for example, is Anthony Libby, a poet-critic who teaches at Ohio
  State on Stephen Dunn's <I>New and Selected Poems: 1974-94</I> (Norton,
  1994) and Stephen Dobyns's <I>Velocities, New and Selected Poems</I>, 1966-1992
  (Viking-Penguin, 1994) in the <I>New York Times Book Review</I> for 15
  January 1995:<BR>
  <BR>
<blockquote>
  Are all the best poems about loss? They are not, probably, about happiness
  or love's sweet contentment, and the poet who aims to traverse those pleasant
  territories takes a hard road. . . . The heart of [Dunn's] collection records
  a long struggle to develop a voice true to Mr. Dunn's simple affirmations
  and proof against the cynical reader's resistance. . . . [As for Dobyns],
  His is a more traditional style of masculinity, somewhat cool or repressed,
  angry, torn by constant awareness that &quot;we are the creatures that
  love and slaughter&quot;. . . . The triumph of Stephen Dobyns's poetry
  may be that it keeps that sense of play intact, without denying horrors.
  . . . His quirky imagination affirms by celebrating itself, if not the
  dark and clouded world. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#2" TARGET="resource window">2</A>)</FONT></blockquote><BR>
  <BR>
  What is this supposed to mean? Why should the &quot;quirky imagination&quot;
  of our time &quot;celebrate itself&quot;? Why do we want poetry that conveys
  a &quot;somewhat cool or repressed masculinity&quot;? And do we in fact
  need poetry to tell us that &quot;'we are creatures that love and slaughter'&quot;?<BR>
  <BR>
  Or, to take a third example, consider the poet David Kirby's review of
  Marilyn Hacker's <I>Selected Poems, 1965-1990</I> (Norton, 1994), again
  in the <I>New York Times Book Review</I> (12 March 1995). Kirby begins
  by announcing, &quot;The history of recent literature is the history of
  the phrase 'Only connect.' Writers and readers have taken these words from
  E. M. Forster's 'Howard's End' as an exhortation, with 'only' meaning 'merely'
  or perhaps 'exclusively'&quot; (NYTBR 6). Those of us who don't quite subscribe
  to the notion that American poetry in the 1990s is written under the sign
  of E. M. Forster needn't worry. The reference functions merely as an acceptable
  literary lead-in, and Kirby quickly moves on to his more personal impressions:
  &quot;At a time when so many writers seem to be measuring life from a considerable
  remove, it is invigorating to watch Marilyn Hacker glad-handing her way
  through the world with a warm facility. And a formalism so colloquial as
  to undo any readerly stereotypes&quot;(6).<BR>
  <BR>
  The <I>New York Times Book Review</I> has been castigated for not devoting
  enough space to poetry. I recently received a letter from a well-meaning
  New Yorker, asking me to sign a petition demanding that the number of poetry
  reviews be increased. True, the percentage is shockingly low: for the period
  January-June 1995, of approximately 500 reviews, only five or 1% deal with
  new poetry. But quantity, I have come to conclude, is not the answer. Indeed,
  I shall argue here, if the discourse on poetry in the popular press can't
  be better than the examples I've just given, I for one would prefer a moratorium
  on the half-hearted attempt to include, for the sake of some residual notion
  of &quot;culture&quot;, the occasional poetry review along with the occasional
  poem, the latter invariably presented inside a box as if to cordon it off
  from more important matters. But my modest proposal is not as pessimistic
  as it may sound. For I also want to suggest that the abysmal state of poetry
  reviewing in the popular press is not, paradoxically, hurting the cause
  of poetry itself, which is, to my mind, extraordinarily healthy at the
  moment. Rather, there seems to be a mechanism at play that is making &quot;literary
  journalism&quot; fairly irrelevant so far as contemporary literary production
  is concerned. It is this mechanism I want to explore below.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B><BR>
  HISTORY LESSONS</B><BR>
  <BR>
  Was poetry reviewing better in the Good Old Days? Is it only in recent
  years, thanks to the increasing commodification of our culture, that poetry
  seems to have no place in the public arena? Conservative critics like Dana
  Gioia would have us think so, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#3" TARGET="resource window">3</A>)</FONT> but a statistical survey of actual book reviewing
  tells us otherwise. My examples here are taken from what are generally
  regarded as the two leading book reviews in the United States: the popular
  <I>New York Times Book Review</I>, at this writing exactly a hundred years
  old, still the review that can make or break a book so far as sales are
  concerned, and the <I>New York Review of Books</I>, which began publication
  in 1963 in response to to the extended strike at the <I>New York Times</I>,
  and quickly established itself as the intellectuals' book review of choice.<BR>
  <BR>
  The first issue of <I>The New York Times Book Review</I> (subsequently
  cited as NYTBR) appeared on 10 October 1896 as what was then called <I>the
  Saturday Book Review Supplement</I>. Its avowed purpose, according to Francis
  Brown's introductory essay for the Arno Press Reprint of 1968, was &quot;to
  bring to readers news of books, news of authors, news of publishing, literary
  news of all kinds.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#4" TARGET="resource window">4</A>)</FONT> In 1896, this last category included such things
  as &quot;reports on the state of Oscar Wilde in Reading Gaol.&quot; Indeed,
  there are continuing reports, throughout 1897, on Wilde's condition, which
  is declared &quot;beyond human endurance&quot;, and his consequent turn
  to spirituality (see Rowland Strong in the 12 June1897 issue). Reviewing
  was thus a form of reporting, its avowed aim being, as Brown puts it, &quot;to
  help the reader and buyer, not the writer or publisher.&quot; The reviewer
  thus has the interests of the non-specialist reader in mind; he (the pronoun
  is used generically) functions as &quot;his reader's guide, philosopher
  and friend. It is his business to say of new books what there is in them
  in such wise that his reader may learn whether the book under notice will
  probably interest him. Knowledge, equity and candor are the chief elements
  in the equipment of the book reviewer.&quot;<BR>
  <BR>
  Two assumptions govern these and related statements. First, it was assumed
  that objective judgments on books could be made by more or less anonymous
  impersonal reviewers. (In the early years, the front page leader was in
  fact anonymous). And second, it was taken for granted that a review of
  &quot;literature&quot; was just that--a review of novels, poems, plays,
  perhaps belles-lettres, not, as is typical today, books on political, historical,
  psychological, anthropological subjects, on current events, and especially
  biographies. Reminiscing about the pre-World War I years, Brown writes:<BR>
  </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>In retrospect these were great literary years, these years before World
    War I. In verse, names were being made that would dominate for a long time
    to come: Yeats and Masefield, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Edward
    Arlington Robinson. In the novel it was the age of Conrad and Thomas Mann,
    Galsworthy, Anatole France, the still unappreciated Dreiser. Willa Cather
    wrote 'O Pioneers', D. H. Lawrence, 'Sons and Lovers', and there was always
    Mrs. Wharton. Kipling in 1907 received a Nobel Prize at 42. (Introduction,
    unpaginated)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR>
  The canon would not be described all that differently today. And Brown
  is also proud to note that in 1922 <B>NYTBR</B> pronounced Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>
  &quot;the most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature
  in the twentieth century&quot; and that Proust's <I>Swann's Way</I> received
  high marks. In the 6 Feb.1897 issue, Paul Lawrence Dunbar's <I>Lyrics of
  Lowly Life</I>, published by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. with an intoduction by
  W. D. Howells received extravagant (and anonymous) praise for its wit,
  keen satire, subtle humor, and &quot;rich colours.&quot; Richard Le Gallienne
  (himself a poet, reviewing Dunbar's <I>Complete Poems</I> on 18 January
  1914 went even further: the poems, he declared, &quot;have a certain classical
  rank in American literature by virtue of an excellence which is in need
  of no allowances on account of the poet's race.&quot; Dunbar's is an &quot;authentic
  achievement which must give him a high and permanent place among the dialect
  poets of the world&quot;, and such poems as &quot;The Debt&quot;, written
  in standard English are also singled out for praise and cited in full.
  One would be hard put to find a an African-American poet today who has
  received this sort of attention in the <I>Times</I>. <BR>
  <BR>
  But lest we wax nostalgic, it was also true that reviewing as spreading-the-word
  (more blurb than critique) ran into trouble as the volume of books increased
  sharply after World War I. And not just their volume but their variety.
  In 1909, after all, F. T. Marinetti had managed to get his first Futurist
  manifesto published on the front page of the Paris <I>Figaro</I>, where
  its competition is little more than the race-track news, the stock-market
  quotations, and the society news. After the war--a watershed for book reviews
  as for so much else--a larger literate (and voting) population demanded
  more political, historical, and social coverage, in reviews as in news
  articles and editorials. At the same time Modernist poetry seemed highly
  obscure. <I>The Waste Land</I> (1922), for example, could not be processed
  as readily as could the collections of short lyric poems to which audiences
  were accustomed, even if those poems were, like Dunbar's, by a black man.
  Eliot's long collage-poem, with its foreign phrases and fussy footnotes
  was not reviewed at all in <B>NYTBR</B>. By this time, in any case, <I>books</I>
  no longer meant just literary books On 6 January 1924, for example, the
  front page of the now larger (thanks to increasing advertising space) book
  review was devoted to a French memoir, the former premier and war minister
  Paul Painl&eacute;v&eacute;'s <I>Comment j'ai nomm&eacute; Foch et Petain</I>.
  The same issue has a review of Count Burian's memoir of the Kaiser Franz
  Joseph and of Bertrand Russell's <I>ABC of Atoms.</I> And by the early
  1930s, the basic blueprint and layout that characterizes the <B>NYTBR</B>
  to this day was in place. The lead article (on the cover, usually with
  a large photograph at the center) tended to be a review of a &quot;major
  new novel&quot; or of a large-scale historical/social critique. On 14 January
  1934, for example, the leader is a review of Pearl Buck's <I>The Mother</I>;
  on 28 January, Sinclair Lewis's <I>Work of Art</I>, on 4 February, Phyllis
  Bentley's <I>A Modern Tragedy</I> (with the headline &quot;A Novel that
  Clarifies Our Age&quot;), and on Feb. 11, Oswald Spengler's <I>The Hour
  of Decision</I>. <BR>
  <BR>
  Big novels, big ideas! What happens to poetry or to the more avant-garde
  literary productions in this context. Poetry could hardly be eliminated,
  a neoVictorian, neoRomantic culture continuing to demand its &quot;higher&quot;
  presence, even as it does in today's <I>New Yorke</I>r, <I>New Republic</I>,
  or <I>Atlantic.</I> But as slender books of poems continued to proliferate,
  the group review became normative, one of the reviewer's chief tasks thus
  being to find a common thread like Kirby's &quot;Only connect.&quot; The
  reviewers tended to be themselves minor poets or, as in the founding days
  of <B>NYTBR</B>, professional reporters. Certainly there was no precedent
  for asking a poetry specialist (e.g., an English professor) to review these
  books. For poetry--and this bias is still with us--is something &quot;everyone&quot;
  can more or less talk about. We all, after all, know what it is when we
  see it and many of us write it for birthdays, weddings, or just to please
  ourselves. Jimmy Carter is a case in point. &quot;I have always found it
  possible&quot;, said Carter on the occasion of his best-selling <I>Always
  a Reckoning </I>(New York: Random House 1995), &quot;to say things in my
  poems that would have been impossible to say in prose.&quot; Things like
  how sad he was to have to kill his aged dog:<BR>
  </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Yesterday I killed him. I had known<BR>
    <BR>
    for months I could not let him live. I might<BR>
    <BR>
    have paid someone to end it, but I knew<BR>
    <BR>
    that after fifteen years of sharing life<BR>
    <BR>
    the bullet ending his must be my own. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR>
  Try saying that bit of blank verse in prose! The newspaper reviewers did
  not wish to be harsh. And soon Jimmy Carter was embarking on a book tour
  around the U.S. and to Dylan Thomas's Wales.<BR>
  <BR>
  The 14 January 1934 issue (the one with J. Donald Adams' review of Pearl
  Buck's <I>The Mother</I> on the cover), typically has a full-page article
  on &quot;Six New Books of Verse by a Diversity of Poets.&quot; Among the
  poets are Kimi Gengo, Adelaide Love, C. Arthur Coan, and Mary Owens Lewis.
  The reviewer Percy Hutchinson praises the poems in Adelaide Love's <I>The
  Slender Singing Tree</I> (its &quot;highly engaging title&quot; is remarked
  upon) which are &quot;written with skill against a background of deep thought.&quot;
  He cites &quot;The Lien&quot;:<BR>

  &quot;Somehow&quot;, remarks Hutchinson, &quot;this seems to us the possible
  utterance of a disciplined Emily Dickinson. Not, of course, that the real
  Emily could ever have been disciplined, either as to thought or poetic
  utterance. . . . But . . . the Amherst spinster-poet must ever stand symbolically
  for her sex's expression of itself in poetry. Thus it seems to us that
  Adelaide Love carries on what might be termed the Emily Dickinson tradition,
  that is, she expresses herself fragmentarily while seeing with inclusive
  vision, and plucks at the heart-strings, but always with the most gentle
  touch, perceiving and transferring beauty&quot; (p. 14). <BR>
  <BR>
  From our vantage point sixty years later, we can laugh at the very idea
  of Adelaide Love's little jingle being compared (not unfavorably!) to the
  work of the, alas, &quot;undisciplined&quot; Emily Dickinson. But the problems
  of poetry reviewing confronting Percy Hutchinson were not all that different
  from those experienced by David Kirby in his review of Marilyn Hacker or
  even by Glynn Maxwell in his omnibus piece for the <B>TLS</B>. The mandate--to
  say something telling and original about five or ten unlike and generally
  unexceptional volumes of short personal lyrics--is not easy to fulfill.
  We can see this even in the more specifically literary journals like the
  <I>Georgia Review </I>or the <I>Hudson</I> <I>Review</I>. Consider an article
  in <B>PN<I> </I>Review</B> 80 (1991), in which T. J. G. Harris discusses
  Michael Hulse's <I>Eating Strawberries in the Necropolis</I> and Andrew
  Motion's <I>Love in a Life</I>, along with the first book, <I>Tale of </I>the
  Mayor's Son, by the very Glyn Maxwell who wrote that snide review for <B>TLS</B>.
  Maxwell, being the newcomer in this group, gets one long paragraph:<BR>
  <BR>
  Glynn Maxwell combines strictness of form with abrupt arbitrariness, a
  kind of headlong, thrown-together, jagged improvisation that, if it often
  has small attraction for the ear, certainly has, as Joseph Brodsky remarks
  on the back of the book, a 'propulsion . . ., owing in part to his tendency
  to draw metaphor from the syntax itself'. But the propulsion is not so
  often real as apparent, and one has the frequent impression that a device
  (a tricky self-reference or address to the reader, a drawing of metaphor
  from syntax, a blatant obscurity of one kind or another--of which there
  are far too many) has been thrown in not so much to keep something going
  as to stop it from flagging. The 'propulsion' also makes reading this book,
  which would have been better shorter, a wearying--and not, as it should
  be, an exhilerating-- experience, since everything starts sounding the
  breathless, edgy same as it whoops and echoes in the ear's labyrinth. Maxwell
  needs an editor. But he is good at creating an atmosphere of arbitrary
  urban or suburban menace, and he can be funny. One senses a definite and
  characteristic style coming clear in this, his first book. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#6" TARGET="resource window">6</A>)</FONT><BR>
  <BR>
  This may have a more sophisticated patina than a comparable review in <B>NYTBR</B>,
  but what is it we really learn about Glyn Maxwell from Harris's review?
  Primarily that the book has the imprimatur of Joseph Brodsky, which probably
  accounts for its having been published by Bloodaxe in the first place What
  else does Harris tell us? Well, that Maxwell opts for &quot;strictness
  of form&quot; although that term is never specified. What is &quot;strict&quot;
  form? Quatrains? Sonnets? Blank verse? Sestinas? Canzones? Haiku or renga?
  And if &quot;jagged improvisation&quot; is confined within strict forms
  is it still improvisation? Further: if Maxwell is, as Harris implies, tricky
  and needlessly obscure, how and where is he &quot;funny&quot;? But the
  most puzzling phrase in this review is the reference to that &quot;atmosphere
  of arbitrary urban or suburban menace&quot;, which Maxwell is evidently
  so &quot;good at creating.&quot; Does this mean he is not good at creating
  an atmosphere of rural menace? Lambs stolen by vicious vagrants? Cows on
  speed jumping over fences? Or does he mean that Maxwell does not take on
  the menace of wild, untramelled nature? Of fire and flood and earthquake?
  But then what English poet today does write about these subjects? Urban
  <I>or</I> suburban--that about covers the menace most of Maxwell's readers
  are likely to have experienced.<BR>
  <BR>
  <I>The New York Review of Books</I>, to which I now turn, does not go in
  for this sort of empty impressionism. Its own solution (and <B>LRB</B>'s
  is similar) is to limit the list of reviewable poets, confining itself
  to a very small circle and then devoting long, individual reviews to its
  members. From its inception in 1963, <B>NYRB</B> has limited itself largely
  to the poetry of Robert Lowell (the then-husband of Elizabeth Hardwick,
  one of <B>NYRB</B>'s founding editors) and to the Lowell circle that includes
  John Berryman, Elizabeth Bishop, Randall Jarrell, Sylvia Plath, and James
  Merrill. Auden is an elder statesman who belongs to the group as is, at
  the other end of the age-scale, Adrienne Rich. A few British poets--Seamus
  Heaney, Philip Larkin, Thom Gunn, later James Fenton-- have been invited
  to join the club along with Americans on the circle's fringes like Theodore
  Roethke, W. S. Merwin and Howard Nemerov. Helen Vendler, a regular <B>NYRB</B>
  reviewer, has tried to bring John Ashbery into the fold, but Ashbery seems
  not to be taken very seriously by such other <B>NYRB</B> poetry reviewers
  as Denis Donoghue and Frank Kermode; a number of his recent books have
  not been reviewed in <B>NYRB </B>at all. <BR>
  <BR>
  However this parochialism may have been justified in the sixties and seventies
  --and bear in mind that NYR studiously ignored the Objectivists (Louis
  Zukofsky, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, Charles Reznikoff, Lorine Niedecker),
  the Beats, the Black Mountain and San Francisco poets, as well as John
  Cage, Ian Hamilton Finlay, and any number of Dada, Surrealist, and Fluxus
  poets-- it has become, in the mid-nineties, a way of denying poetry its
  very life. For most of the above are now safely dead, and where are the
  young who should replace them? Has time simply stopped so that &quot;poetry&quot;
  can mean no more than a review of Elizabeth Bishop's posthumously published
  letters or an obituary essay about James Merrill? So, much of today's &quot;literary
  journalism&quot; would have us believe. In a recent article in <I>The Economist</I>
  (8 July 1995, p. 82), for example, we are told that &quot;[America']s poetic
  voice has shrunk to a whisper&quot;, that &quot;Since the death of Robert
  Lowell in 1977, America seems to have lacked a major poet. In fact most
  people are not even aware of the concerns of American poets these days.
  It has declined into a minor art, subsidised principally by universities.&quot;
  The occasion for these ruminations is the publication by prestigious Faber
  &amp; Faber of three younger (actually not so young) American poets: Charles
  Simic, Chase Twitchell, and August Kleinzahler. But since these are (rightly,
  to my mind) discovered to be not all that remarkable, the anonymous <I>Economist</I>
  writer feels the point has been proved. <BR>
  <BR>
  The reasoning here is purely circular. If Chase Twitchell &quot;represents&quot;
  the New American Poetry, then the New American Poetry can't be very good,
  right? And since, so many of us would argue, even Robert Lowell can't represent
  great American poetry quite as convincingly as did Walt Whitman or Emily
  Dickinson or T. S. Eliot --well, then, things are really pretty bad, aren't
  they? Thus, while the <I>New York Review of Books</I> and <B>TLS</B> pay
  careful attention to the New Historicism, the New Gender Criticism, or
  the New Cultural Studies, they pay no comparable attention--indeed, no
  attention at all--to the New Poetics. Let us consider why this is the case.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B><BR>
  POETRY DEGREE ZERO</B><BR>
  <BR>
  Suppose a reviewer is assigned to write a piece on Renaissance New Historicist
  studies. He or she knows (or quickly learns) that the founding father of
  this movement is Stephen Greenblatt, a professor at Berkeley, whose new
  book is to be discussed in the review along with others by Thomas Lacqueur,
  Richard Helgerson, and Nancy Vickers. The reviewer reads &quot;background&quot;
  material, considers opposing views, and is ready to write the piece. A
  similar process takes place when a reviewer takes on, say, the most recent
  book by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard or Hel&egrave;ne Cixous. <BR>
  <BR>
  But--and here's the rub--what <I>is </I>poetry anyway? Does anyone have
  a clear idea? The problem is not insurmountable if the review is to be
  of Milton or Eliot or even H.D. studies, for these canonical authors at
  least partially provide norms against which books about their oeuvre will
  be judged. But Charles Bernstein? Charles Wright? Charles Simic? Who knows
  what is to be looked for in the case of their books? <BR>
  <BR>
  A further complication has been produced by the relative positioning of
  poetry and theory in the university curriculum of the past few decades.
  We expect graduate students in English or Comparative Literature to be
  familiar with Saussure's distinction between signifier and signified, Roman
  Jakobson's distinction between metaphor and metonymy, with Lacan's elaboration
  on that distinction, and Paul De Man's related discussion of irony and
  allegory. The &quot;death of the author,&quot; as defined by Barthes and
  Foucault is now a common topic of discussion. Judith Butler's notions of
  &quot;gender performativity&quot; are regularly cited as are Fredric Jameson's
  interpretations of consumer culture and Homi K. Bhabha's theories on the
  hybridity and porosity of nations.<B> </B>But when the book to be discussed
  is a book of poems, the reader suddenly seems to forget everything he or
  she has learned about <I>literariness</I>, about the cultural construction
  of the subject, the naturalisation of ideology, and the relation of genre
  to gender. The fairly simple principle that the choice of verse form is
  never merely arbitrary, that one doesn't just &quot;at will&quot; write
  sonnets on Monday, fragmented free verse on Tuesday, and prose on Wednesday
  is largely ignored, as is the twin question why poet X--say, Philip Larkin-
  never wrote prose poetry. And beyond the individual poet, what about period
  style? National or ethnic styles? Are the &quot;affirmations&quot; of a
  &quot;quirky imagination&quot; the same in 1990 as they were when Wordsworth
  wrote &quot;Resolution and Independence&quot;? <BR>
  <BR>
  A sense of history and a sense of theory: these are the twin poles of criticism
  missing from most poetry discourse today and hence missing in the typical
  poetry review. Poet X, we read regularly, &quot;has found his voice.&quot;
  But is his voice one worth finding? Poet Y never lets her formalism get
  in the way of the colloquial. But why do we want poetry to be colloquial?
  &quot;There is a distinct world in Michael Longley's poetry&quot;, writes
  his fellow poet Eavan Boland, &quot;He has created it from a sense of lost
  values, out of lyric irony, and with a considerable fortitude.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#7" TARGET="resource window">7</A>)</FONT> But
  in most discourses today the very idea of a &quot;distinct world&quot;
  is suspect, and as for those &quot;values&quot; to be recovered with &quot;considerable
  fortitude&quot;,maybe it would be better if they were &quot;lost.&quot;<BR>
  <BR>
  The poetry review (one poet reviewing another) comes, directly or indirectly,
  out of the poetry workshop, and the poetry workshop (or, for that matter,
  the creative writing workshop in general) is still dominated by a regressively
  Romantic concept of the poet as a man speaking to men (or woman speaking
  to women--the principle is the same), by the notion that poetry is emotion
  recollected in tranquillity, the poet speaking for all of us--only more
  sensitively, perceptively, and expertly. And how could the workshop be
  otherwise without going out of existence? How could it not be based on
  the assumption that a given student just might have &quot;talent&quot;,
  that that talent needs to find a conduit of expression and then he or she
  can become a certified poet. One writes on a given subject or uses a given
  verse form, the instructor and one's fellow students provide constructive
  criticism and, if one is diligent and lucky, poems are born--and published
  in <I>American Poetry Review</I>. <BR>
  <BR>
  Ironically this workshop / journalism discourse is wholly at odds, not
  only with the discourses of architecture, anthropology, social science,
  and philosophy, but also with the amazing body of writing on poetics (often
  by poets themselves) throughout our century.. From Roman Jakobson's brilliant
  study of Khlebnikov called <I>New Russian Poetry</I> (1921), Ezra Pound's
  &quot;How to Read&quot;(1928), and Gertrude Stein's <I>How to Write</I>
  (1931), to the Concrete Poetry manifestos of the 1950s, produced by the
  Noigandres group in Brazil, to John Cage's<I> Silence</I> (1962) and <I>A
  Year From Monday</I> (1969), Ingeborg Bachmann's <I>Wir m&uuml;ssen wahre
  S&auml;tze finden</I> (1983), and Susan Howe's <I>The Birthmark</I> (1993),
  we have an exciting body of poetics, a discourse on poetry impressive in
  its richness and excitement. This is not to say that there is large-scale
  agreement between individual poet-theorists, but what can be said is that,
  from Futurism and Dada on down, the international poetic impetus has been
  constructivist rather than expressivist: it is committed, in other words,
  to the basic theorem that poetry is the language art, the art in which
  the &quot;what&quot; cannnot be separated from &quot;how&quot;, in which
  the said exists only in the saying. In his widely discussed &quot;Artifice
  of Absorption&quot; (reprinted in <I>A Poetics</I>), Charles Bernstein
  calls this quality the &quot;non-absorbability&quot; of poetic discourse.
  But then Yeats had already said as much when he declared that &quot;Our
  words must seem to be inevitable.&quot; At the same time--and here is a
  corollary principle about which there's little disagreement in the arena
  of poetics (as compared to the arena of poetic journalism)-- poetic language
  is never simply unique, natural, and universal; it is the product, in large
  part, of particular social, historical, and cultural formations. And these
  formations demand study.<BR>
  <BR>
  There is, then, no good intellectual reason why poetry reviewing in, say,
  the <B>TLS</B>, couldn't be just as useful and interesting as reviews of
  urban or gender studies. But--and here we have to consider the larger cultural
  landscape --it's not likely to happen in our culture because, to put it
  bluntly, there isn't enough at stake. As long as self-proclaimed poets
  appear on the scene in every city and small town in Britain or America
  --and, oddly enough, poetry still has enough cultural capital for this
  to be the case <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#8" TARGET="resource window">8</A>)</FONT> --as long as the editors of <B>NYTBR</B>, <B>NYRB </B>TLS,
  and so on have to choose books to be reviewed from a wide variety of disciplines
  and areas, there is no way to weed out the dross, which is about 90% of
  so-called poetry publication. Who, we say democratically and bravely, is
  to decide which of the countless poets now plying their trade are worthy
  of attention? And why is one set of poetic principles--say, the ones I've
  just adumbrated above--any more &quot;valid&quot; than another?<BR>
  <BR>
  Notice we never say this about historians or anthropologists--or even architects,
  perhaps because certification in these fields is a complex process. A given
  architect or architecture critic might, for example, personally dislike
  the work of Frank Gehry or of Denise Scott-Brown. But that work won't be
  dismissed by reviewers as simply unimportant or irrelevant. In poetry journalism,
  however, it happens all the time: witness James Fenton's &quot;Getting
  Rid of the Burden of Sense&quot;, a review of John Ashbery's <I>Selected
  Poems</I> (1985) in <B>NYTBR</B> (29 December 1985, p. 10). The poet, declares
  Fenton, &quot;ask[s] of the reader impossible feats of attention . . .
  yielding only a minimum of reward.&quot; And he confesses that &quot;There
  were times during my reading of this 'Selected Poems' (a gathering from
  30 years' work) when I actually thought I was going to burst into tears
  of boredom.&quot;<BR>
  <BR>
  <B><BR>
  NEW THRESHOLDS, NEW ANATOMIES</B> <BR>
  <BR>
  What, in the face of such arbitrary and subjective judgment, can be done
  to strengthen critical writing about poetry? A lot, actually, but perhaps
  no longer in the popular literary press. In the last decade or so, thanks
  to the world of the internet and hyperspace, of desktop publishing and
  small press production, poetry, as even the newspapers keep telling us,
  is once more a widely practiced and popular art form, and the discourse
  about it is becoming much more interesting. A case in point is a large,
  glossy-paged volume called <I>Exact Change Yearbook no. 1: Yearbook 1995</I>,
  edited by a young poet named Peter Gizzi, who received his training in
  the Buffalo Poetics Program from Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, and Robert
  Creeley, and is co-published by Exact Change in Boston and the Carcanet
  Press in the UK. Its elegant and perhaps too extravant layout has been
  executed by a team of production assistants and printed in Hong Kong. <I>Yearbook
  1</I> features Michael Palmer, glamorously pictured on the book's cover
  and represented by an excellent interview with Peter Gizzi and a twelve-page
  selection from his work. And--signs of the times-- the Yearbook includes
  a <B>CD</B> of readings by twelve poets from Palmer to Ted Berrigan <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#9" TARGET="resource window">9</A>)</FONT> and
  is available for $35 in the U.S., &#163;19.50 in Britain. I bought my copy
  at the Museum of Contemporary Art bookshop in Los Angeles.<BR>
  <BR>
  In their prefatory &quot;Publisher's Note&quot;, Damon Krukowski and Naomi
  Yang (who doubles as the book's designer) write that they wanted to replace
  the now defunct New Directions annual (edited for some forty years by James
  Laughlin) with &quot;a large miscellany of avant-garde work, both contemporary
  and historical, chosen less to represent a particular 'school', and more
  in the spirit of learning what's out there.&quot; To this end, the publishers
  asked Gizzi &quot;to help us find a range of contemporary work that draws
  on the tradition we publish in our books of Surrealist and other early
  twentieth-century experimentation. . . . To what came back we added work
  by Exact Change authors [Stein, Cage, de Chirico, Aragon], as well as a
  few other discoveries we were eager to share.&quot;<BR>
  <BR>
  What makes the project unusual is that it juxtaposes avant-garde poets
  and artists from the <B>U.S</B>. (ranging chronologically from the <I>Imaginary
  Elegies</I> of the late Jack Spicer and Fanny Howe's presentation of extracts
  from John Wiener's very moving journal <I>707 Scott Street</I>, to a &quot;Gallery&quot;
  of younger largely unknown poets like Paul Beatty, Tory Dent, and Jennifer
  Moxley), with their counterparts abroad--specifically, in Britain, France,
  Germany, China, Russia--and, closer to home, in the Caribbean and Canada.
  And as if these juxtapositions weren't enough, we can also read, say, Clark
  Coolidge or Susan Howe against Gertrude Stein's <I>Before the Flowers of
  Friendship faded Friendship Faded</I>, which is printed for the first time
  (as Julianna Spahr explains in her headnote), together with Stein's source
  text, Georges Hugnet's <I>Enfance</I>, exactly in the form they were originally
  published in the journal <I>Pagany</I> (1930). Or again, we can read Barbara
  Guest's lecture &quot;Poetry the True Fiction&quot; against Hugo Ball's
  &quot;Grand Hotel Metaphysics&quot;, the &quot;Radio Happenings&quot; of
  John Cage and Morton Feldman against Erik Satie's &quot;Dried Embryos&quot;,
  Michael Palmer against Louis Aragon's &quot;Peasant's Dream&quot; or the
  &quot;Fragments&quot; of De Chirico. <BR>
  <BR>
  Such collaging gives, at least me, a sense of--forgive the taboo word--transcendence.
  For instead of the usual anthology wars (who's in, who's out, which editor
  is sufficiently multicultural?) the <I>Exact Change Yearbook</I> offers
  the most convincing evidence I've seen to date that our own radical poetries
  are not (as Maxwell or Fenton would have us think) some kind of local aberration,
  spawned by a bunch of theory-crazed, left-wing poets in New York and San
  Francisco, and perpetrated by <I>les jeunes</I> at Buffalo and other out-of-the
  way stations--poetries that deserve simply to be ignored. Indeed, what
  Gizzi's juxtapositions of U.S. and foreign portfolios suggest is that the
  attention to the materiality of language I spoke of above, to syntactic
  disjunction and visual constellation, and especially to the reconfiguration
  of lyric as speaking, once again, not for the hypothetical &quot;sensitive&quot;
  and &quot;authentic&quot; individual (&quot;Here's a vision I had as I
  was weeding the garden yesterday&quot;) but for the larger cultural and
  philosophical moment--that all these are now characteristic of poetries
  produced around the globe.<BR>
  <BR>
  Take Jeff Twitchell's portfolio of the &quot;Original Chinese Language
  Group.&quot; As Twitchell explains, &quot;Original, not in the sense of
  unique, but because of their interest in the earlier meanings and associations
  that can be read in the Chinese written character. . . .So, too, the recuperation
  of the original impetus of poetry as the play in language.&quot; The &quot;Original
  Poets&quot;, Twitchell notes, go beyond their predecessors, the so-called
  &quot;Misty&quot; (because branded &quot;obscure&quot; by the official
  critics) poets of the late 1970s, of whom the best known in the U.S. is
  Bei Dao. The 1988 &quot;Original&quot; Manifesto, reproduced here, comes
  out strongly against the localism, ethnocentrism, and nationalism that
  bedevilled Communist China until quite recently. The aim is to make contact
  with &quot;modern Western art&quot;, and the vehicle for such contact,
  the manifesto declares, is the written character, which, compared to spoken
  language, is &quot;less polluted and pre-judged.&quot; &quot;We do not
  avoid&quot;, they declare, &quot;the phrase 'word games' which already
  has aroused great misunderstanding. We even like it. 'Game' [<I>y&oacute;uxi</I>]
  is a word, connoting the profound, eerie spirit of art and philosophy.&quot;
  And the text gives way to the visual image of a large black cross which
  represents the intersection of &quot;swim&quot; [<I>y&oacute;u</I>]--to
  get in touch with reality-- and &quot;play&quot; [<I>x&igrave;</I>]. <BR>
  <BR>
  Twichell's portfolio is taken from the selection that appeared in the British
  journal <I>Parataxis</I> (#7, 1994), edited by the poet Drew Milne. In
  translation, the poems themselves--by Che Quian-Zi, Zhou Ya-Ping, Yi Cun,
  Huang Gan, Xian Meng, and Hong Liu (the one woman in this group)--don't
  quite live up to that manifesto. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#10" TARGET="resource window">10</A>)</FONT> &quot;Word games&quot;, in the sense of
  Steve McCaffery's or Charles Bernstein's paragrammatic play, are less common
  than neo-Surrealist imagery and the casting of a sharp eye on the &quot;direct
  treatment of the thing,&quot; in the Poundian Imagist sense. Just as Pound's
  fabled &quot;invention of China&quot; turns out to have little to do with
  the classical Chinese models which were his source, so the Original Poets's
  version of &quot;language poetry&quot; is more graphic and precisionist
  than, say, Lyn Hejinian's or Bob Perelman's. Here, for example, is Part
  III of Zhou Ya-Ping's &quot;Vulgar Beauty&quot;:<BR>

  We must remember that in the Chinese, as J. H.Prynne notes in his Afterword,
  the &quot;iconic deployment [of the language] by stroke play and contexture
  makes a traffic with the eye worked by a different ground-plan.&quot; At
  one point, the translators planned to include some of the Chinese text
  so as to show how the tactile element works, but the Originals themselves
  countered this idea because, as Prynne puts it, &quot;it would suggest
  exoticism or extraneous willow-pattern ornament; to them, we are the exotics,
  with our credit-card view of the speech act.&quot;<BR>
  <BR>
  That &quot;credit-card view&quot; is satirized in Prynne's own poems in
  <I>Bands around the Throat</I>, the entire chapbook, originally published
  in Cambridge in a limited edition, reprinted in the <I>Exact Change Yearbook.</I>
  And Tom Raworth's &quot;Anglo-Irish Alternative,&quot; a portfolio printed
  elsewhere in the anthology, provides a rich context in which to understand
  Prynne's work. Such contextualizing (one should certainly read Rosmarie
  Waldrop's Berlin portfolio &quot;against&quot; Raworth's) provides a kind
  of information that is absent from the short review, however elegant, of
  the individual poet. And Gizzi's juxtapositions have their counterpart
  in a number of recent anthologies. Since 1993 alone, the following have
  appeared: Eliot Weinberger's, <I>American Poetry Since 1950: Innovators
  and Outsiders</I> (Marsilio, evidently a best-seller in Mexico in a Spanish
  edition), Paul Hoover's <I>A Norton Book of Postmodern Poetry</I> (Norton),
  Douglas Messerli's <I>From the Other Side of the Century: A New American
  Poetry 1960-90</I> (Sun &amp; Moon), Volume 1 of Jerome Rothenberg and
  Pierre Joris's <I>Poems for the Millenium</I> (California), and, most recently,
  Maggie O'Sullivan's <I>Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry
  by Women in North America &amp; the UK</I> (Reality Street Editions). Some
  of these anthologies have barely been reviewed, and yet, in what is a surprising
  development, they are already being assigned for classroom use and discussed
  at conferences. Romana Huk, a professor at the University of New Hampshire,
  for example, has organized an international poetry festival called &quot;Assembling
  Alternatives,&quot; based, in the case of Anglo-American poetry, largely
  on such yet-to-be-reviewed anthologies and small press books, many of which
  she came across during a fellowship year in the UK.<BR>
  <BR>
  But how, it will be asked, is such work disseminated if not via reviews
  in the major papers? Here is where electronic discussion groups and the
  internet come in. On the Poetics Discussion Group sponsored at <B>SUNY</B>-Buffalo
  and open to anyone who hears about it by word of mouth and cares to join,
  the daily conversation now contains an average of 1200 lines and includes
  postings from all over the world. Much of the &quot;talk&quot; is trivial:
  who said what to whom where, what X meant when she said Y, and so on. But
  there have lately been extended conversations on the nature of free verse,
  on &quot;close reading&quot; (Peter Quartermain began this one when he
  asked, on the net, &quot;Why the animus against close reading? Do we want
  distant and/or careless reading?&quot;), and on the relation of language
  poetry to other contemporary movements. Bob Perelman's new critical book
  <I>The Trouble with Genius: </I>Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky
  (California, 1995) has been discussed in a series of postings; indeed,
  the argument as to what Perelman's book <I>does</I> and what its implications
  might be, acts as a kind of <I>supplement</I> (in the Derridean sense of
  addition as well as substitute) for the more conventional book review.

  Buffalo also sponsors the <A HREF="http://www.buffalo.edu/epc">Electronic
  Poetry Center</A> where one can call up, say, an &quot;Authors&quot; file
  and access an impressive list of poets, each one represented by a photograph,
  followed by selected poems, prose writings, bibliography, and so on. Then,
  too, the Electronic Poetry Center publishes its own journal, <I>Rif/t</I>,
  which contains poems, fictions, critical essays, and reviews as does the
  on-line <I>Postmodern </I>Culture, published at the University of Virginia.
  A new group has just been formed in San Francisco that discusses concrete
  poetry, visual poetics, and language-art relationships; this one is called
  <I>Majordomo</I> and is accessed by subscribing to something called <I>Wr-eye-tings</I>;
  a related group is <I>Silence</I>, devoted to the work of the late John
  Cage; this group is extremely active, sharing information about Cage scores,
  recordings, musical interpretations, poetic texts, and so on. James Pritchett's
  recent book on Cage's music (Cambridge, 1994) was discussed and debated
  in a series of postings. <BR>
  <BR>
  The &quot;reviewing&quot; that occurs on such lists and in the new <I>e-zines</I>
  is by no means ideal. Internet reviewers are not likely to be as accountable
  as are their counterparts in the print media, and editors are not likely
  to ask for a lot of revisions and fact checks. The ephemerality of the
  medium controlls the discourse: one flick of the finger, after all, and
  the text disappears from the screen, perhaps not to be found again. Then,
  too, onscreen discussion of poetry and poetics is designed for a limited
  (and largely younger) audience that is at home with the new technologies.

  And this raises the spectre of the nominal &quot;public&quot; that, for
  the past hundred years, has ostensibly depended on reviewers to help it
  decide what poetry books to read. Doesn't a weekly paper like <B>TLS</B>
  owe something to this non-professional public, and isn't it therefore better
  to &quot;cover&quot; a range of books, even as Glyn Maxwell does in his
  omnibus piece? Two books on Larkin, one on Walcott, some theoretical treatises
  from the U.S.: why not let the reader decide which ones are worth her while?<BR>
  <BR>
  My own sense is that this middle-class poetry public no longer exists,
  that poetics is now at least as specialized as is architectural discourse;
  indeed, the latter actually speaks to a much wider audience than does poetry,
  given that everyone lives and works in specific buildings and hence takes
  an interest in the look and feel of the built environment. In the case
  of poetry, however, the rapprochement with the university may well be a
  <I>fait accompli</I>. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#11" TARGET="resource window">11</A>)</FONT> And thus it is that the <B>TLS</B> or <B>NYRB
  </B>review may well be on its way toward becoming obsolete.<BR>
  <BR>
  Take the case of Charles Bernstein's <I>A Poetics</I>, the book Maxwell
  dismissed so offhandedly. This 1992 collection of &quot;essays&quot; (the
  first and longest piece &quot;Artifice of Absorption&quot; is, strictly
  speaking, a verse treatise, written in what is predominantly iambic pentameter)
  was reviewed neither in <B>NYTBR</B> nor in <B>NYRB</B>, nor in <I>The
  New Republic</I>, <I>The Village Voice Literary Supplement</I>, or <I>The
  Washington Post Book World</I>, to mention just the most obvious daily
  and weekly papers. Yet within two years of its publication, it appeared
  on course syllabi across the U.S. (and many in the <B>UK</B> and Australia
  as well), has become a popular item on PhD qualifying exams, and is cited,
  along with Bernstein's earlier collection of critical prose, <I>Content's
  Dream</I> (Sun &amp; Moon, 1986), with increasing frequency. The relation
  of &quot;absorption&quot; to &quot;anti-absorption&quot; in poetry is discussed
  in learned journals. And <I>A Poetics</I> has now sold some 5,000 copies
  and has gone through two printings and numerous translations.<BR>
  <BR>
  How does the process of dissemination work in a case like Bernstein's?
  How is the readership for such a book constructed? Can the Electronic Poetry
  Center and other <I>e-zines</I>, together with the more traditional scholarly
  journals and small poetry magazines in which <I>A Poetics</I> has been
  reviewed, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<A
  HREF="lit_footnotes.html#12" TARGET="resource window">12</A>)</FONT> really make the difference? Or is distribution dependent on word-of-mouth
  on the campus and at the ever-burgeoning number of conferences? Or controlled
  by a particular group of fellow-poets, professors, end editors? These are
  questions I can't yet answer satisfactorily. But what I can say is that
  literary journalism, as we used to know it and as many of us still practice
  it, has had nothing to do with the case.<BR>
