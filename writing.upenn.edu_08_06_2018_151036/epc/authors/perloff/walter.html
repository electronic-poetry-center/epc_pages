<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=+1 COLOR="#0000a6">The thesis of Walter Benn Michaels's</font> <I>Our America</I> could hardly
  be clearer or more forcefully argued.  It goes like this.  Whereas &quot;the
  major writers of the Progressive period--London, Dreiser, Wharton--were
  comparatively indifferent to questions of both racial and national identity,&quot;
  (8) the literature of the post-war, of the 1920s, is characterized by its
  particular brand of <I>nativism</I>, that is, its commitment to the notion
  that one's identity is defined by racial difference.  Whereas the Progressivists
  believed in the fabled melting pot, in the possibility of wholesale assimilation
  into U. S. citizenry, the pluralist 1920s. substituting a faith in difference
  for one in the superiority of any one group, wanted to preserve racial
  purity at all costs.  Accordingly, identity comes to be defined by one's
  difference from &quot;them&quot;--from those whose blood might contaminate
  one's own.  The fear of miscegenation and of the reproductive family now
  become powerful; &quot;the homosexual family and the incestuous family
  thus emerge as parallel technologies in the effort to prevent half-breeds&quot;
  (49).</P>
  <P>Michaels exemplifies this thesis with literally dozens of examples,
  primarily from the fiction of the period.  In William Faulkner's <I>The
  Sound </I>and the Fury, Quentin Compson's desire to convince others that
  he has committed incest with his sister Caddy is an &quot;attempt through
  language to substitute the blood ties of family for the affective and/or
  legal ties of love and marriage&quot; (5).   In this respect, Quentin and
  Jason are really not all that different; both believe, in their own way,
  that &quot;blood is blood&quot; (3).  Or again, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's
  <I>The Great Gatsby</I>, Tom Buchanan's aversion to Gatsby has less to
  do with class than with race.  For who is Gatsby?  Is he perhaps a Jew,
  hanging out as he does with the likes of Meyer Wolfsheim?  In any case,
  he is not &quot;one of us,&quot; any more than is Robert Cohn in <I>The
  Sun Also Rises</I>.  But then that novel's hero, Jake Barnes, functions
  as Cohn's alter ego: Jake's war wound, which has left him impotent, Michaels
  argues, is again an emblem of the nativist fear of the reproductive family.
   In staying single, Jake preserves his racial identity.</P>
  <P>And so on. From Willa Cather's <I>The Professor's House </I>to Nella
  Larsen's <I>Passing</I> and <I>Quicksand</I>, from Jean Toomer's <I>Cane</I>
  to Carl Van Vechten's <I>Nigger Heaven</I>, nativism is the engine that
  drives human behavior, and in the1920, nativism depends first and last
  on understanding one's Americanness as racial difference.  In Oliver La
  Farge's <I>Laughing Boy</I>, for example, Slim Girl's &quot;genealogical
  ambition is to have children who are 'all Navajo'&quot; (71), even as Nella
  Larsen's Clare learns that &quot;passing&quot; destroys the purity of her
  own identity.  One must be true to one's racial self.</P>
  <P>Pluralism thus turns out to be the bogey.   Whereas Progressivist &quot;claims
  to racial superiority inevitably involved the appeal to standards that
  were understood as common to all races . . . . the pluralist can prefer
  his own race only on the grounds that it is his&quot; (137).  The commitment
  to pluralism is the commitment to the &quot;primacy of identity&quot; (140),
   and thus to what Michaels calls &quot;<I>identity essentialism</I>&quot;
  (140).   Indeed, &quot;there can be no coherent anti-essentialist account
  of race&quot; (134).  For &quot;the particular contribution of pluralism
  to racism is to make racial identity into its own justification.&quot;
  (137).   And when that happens--as is, according to Michaels, the cultural
  condition today--racism prevails. </P>
  <P>But why did this form of nativism occur in the 1920s and recur in the1990s?
   What about the six decades inbetween?  And why should miscegenation be
  such a taboo if the racial Other is considered not inferior but merely
  different, as Michaels claims?  These issues are avoided by a curious sleight-of-hand.
    The inevitable reductionism of Michaels's project (the discussion of
  <I>Gatsby</I>, for example, must play down the role of Nick Carraway so
  as to foreground Tom Buchanan's fears) is acknowledged and declared necessary,
   given the revisionist aim of <I>Our America</I>, which is to provide,
  not close readings of specific texts, but a large-scale reinterpretation
  of modernism.  For American nativism is evidently synonymous with American
  modernism, which is, in its turn, synonymous with the American fiction
  (few works of other genres are included) of the1920s.</P>
  <P>For most literary historians, as for theorists of modernism, the great
  modernist innovations were in place well before World War I.  In his recent
  <I>Modernisms</I>, for example, Peter Nicholls characteristically begins
  with Charles Baudelaire even as T. J. Clark's earlier <I>The Painting of
  Modern Life</I> began with Manet.  But then Michaels's &quot;modernism&quot;
  is best described as a modernism without the modernists, for the most canonical
  American modernist writers-- Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, H.D. Gertrude Stein,
  Djuna Barnes -- are eliminated from Michaels' American modernist canon,
   presumably because they lived abroad and took an interest in non-American
  persons and places.  For example:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>the endpoint of the &quot;heritage&quot; whose origin Pound locates
    in Jefferson is . . . Benito Mussolini: &quot;The heritage of Jefferson
    . . .  is HERE, NOW<I>in the Italian peninsula</I> at the beginning of
    the fascist second decennio, not in Massachusetts or Delaware.&quot;  This
    	&quot;heritage&quot; is thus in no way distinctively American, any more
    than it is distinctly Italian.  Rather, it is disassociated from any particular
    nationality and, indeed, from nationality as such, a concept which Pound
    tended to link disparagingly with &quot;provincialism.&quot;  And, by the
    same token, the &quot;ancestors&quot; to whom Eliot appeals in &quot;Tradition
    and the Individual Talent&quot; (1919) not only extend beyond. . . his
    American predecessors to &quot;the whole of the literature of Europe&quot;
    but beyond Europe as well to &quot;all the poetry that has ever been written.&quot;
     Neither Eliot's &quot;tradition&quot; nor Pound's &quot;heritage&quot;
    is in any sense <I>national</I>. . . .  (102)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>What this line of reasoning ignores is that the very idea of linking
  Jefferson to Mussolini is itself a profoundly nativist theme.  It assumes
  that the desire to transcend one's native grounds, to assert one's difference
  from &quot;ordinary Americans,&quot; again, by the way, on the grounds
  of racial purity of some sort (e.g., true Americans know that their heritage
  can never just be American!), is a desire that can somehow be satisfied,
  even as Quentin thinks that <I>saying</I> he has had incest with Caddy
  means that it really happened.  Similarly, Eliot's desire in &quot;Tradition
  and the Individual Talent&quot; to place his own poetry in relation to
  &quot;all the poetry that has ever been written&quot; (102), could only
  have been made by a poet self-consciously American, and hence self-consciously
  inserting himself into the European arena where poetry does flourish. 
   Just try to imagine Marcel Proust or St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; or
  Paul Val&eacute;ry claiming that theirs was a heritage that transcended
  their national identity!   </P>
  <P>Ironically, a consideration of Pound's or Eliot's nativism would have
  &quot;thickened the plot&quot; of Michaels's narrative. Think of Eliot's
  &quot;East Coker,&quot; with its claim for a racial identity (pure English
  stock) that distinguishes the poet from those others who have names like
  Sweeney or Bleistein.   But even if we grant Michaels his donn&eacute;e,
  even if we assume that such internationalists as Eliot and Pound, Stein
  and Barnes are outside the &quot;nativist&quot; orbit, how, can we equate
  nativism with modernism, when Michaels also eliminates such notable stay-at-homes
  as Wallace Stevens, whose name does not so much as appear in Michaels's
  index, even though Stevens's first great book, <I>Harmonium,</I> appeared
  in 1923?  The answer is not hard to find.  Clearly, if one substitutes
  for Eliot and Stevens, such texts as Anzia Yezierska's <I>Bread Givers</I>
  or La Farge's <I>Laughing Boy</I>, novels  currently being read precisely
  on account of their multicultural rather than their literary interest,
  then of course one can come up with a reinterpretation of &quot;modernism&quot;
  as racially motivated.  The reasoning is patently circular:   (1) Modernism
  has traditionally been defined as X.   (2)  Minority studies of the modernist
  period have unearthed a number of novels that are more properly characterized
  as Y.   Therefore (3) Modernism should be redefined as Y.</P>
  <P>Thus nativism = modernism:  such equations occur in <I>Our America</I>
  because its analytic mode is structuralist rather than in any sense historical.
   The identitarian paradigm once introduced recurs with minor variations
  in novel after novel: Michaels's synopses and exegeses become as repetitive
  and interchangeable as do the characters in <I>The Professor's House</I>
  and <I>The Sun Also Rises</I>.  There is a &quot;Gotcha!&quot; quality
  to all this, as if to say, &quot;Oh, so <I>you</I> thought <I>Gatsby</I>
  dealt with the power of human illusion or with the failure of the American
  dream  and so on, but what the novel is <I>really</I> about is race.&quot;
   The static nature of the analyses is insured by the curious absence of
  <I>history</I>.   Why was the post-war so different from the Progressivist
  era?  What is it that happened that made pluralism and its attendant racism
  so prominent?   To explore the changing demographics or immigration patterns
  of the1920s, to understand the effect of a world war on the modernist ethos,
  would have gone a long way in explaining why Robert Cohn figures so prominently
  in <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> or why Tom Buchanan is reading a book called
  <I>The Rise of the Colored Empires</I>.  An historical study, especially
  of the war period, would also demonstrate in what ways &quot;identity essentialism&quot;
  became important in nations other than the U. S.   In Thomas Mann's <I>Buddenbrooks</I>
  (1903), for example, national identity is still an attribute one has as
  a German citizen plain and simple, and the emphasis is on social and economic
  class.  But for the Mann of <I>The Magic Mountain</I> (1927), racialized
  identity has become a central concern.   The shifting of national boundaries
  after the war, the influx of Eastern European Jews into Germany and the
  West, the questions of the Sudetenland and Alsace-Lorraine:  all these
  produced a strong emphasis on the need for racial purity.  </P>
  <P>Just as literary texts seem to have no historical determinants, so they
  have, in Michaels's spatialized, structuralist paradigm, no authors. He
  makes, for example, no distinction between Ernest Hemingway, an author
  who never offers the slightest critique of the anti-Semitism of his central
  characters--an anti-Semitism that he obviously shares-- and Faulkner, whose
  understanding of the complexities of black as of white people is of a very
  different order.   Or again, Hart Crane's touching explanation, made in
  a letter to his patron Otto Kahn, that he is having difficulties completing
  his long poem <I>The Bridge</I>, whose aim, so the poet claims, is nothing
  short of writing &quot;the myth of America,&quot; is simply taken at face
  value:  Crane's &quot;efforts to capture&quot; the myth, we read, &quot;revolve
  around the figure of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (48).   But this is to underplay
  the intense lyric charge of <I>The Bridge</I>, its inability to produce
  &quot;the myth of America,&quot; even as the poet himself is cruelly anatomized.</P>
  <P>History doesn't count, authors don't count, and, perhaps most problematically,
  the reader doesn't count.  No matter that 99% of Faulkner's readers are
  entranced precisely by the differences between Jason and Quentin (and Quentin
  and , and Quentin and Caddy) rather than the obvious similarities of the
  Compson siblings.   No matter that no one outside the American Studies
  classroom would so much as read the many minor ethnic novels that provide
  Michaels with his exempla.   In fact, the weight of evidence, the endless
  plot summarizing and teasing out of nativist themes becomes quite tedious,
  even in this short book.  Tedious, that is, until the last ten or so pages,
  when the book's polemic thrust is spelled out, when Michaels unleashes
  his critique of our own identitarian moment, a moment in which, all too
  often,  the &quot;American&quot; past is understood as &quot;the Native
  American past, the African American past, the Jewish American past, and
  so on.&quot;  (p. 128)</P>
  <P>&quot;Why,&quot; asks Michaels plaintively, &quot;does it matter who
  we are?&quot;  For &quot;the real question . . . is not <I>which</I> past
  should count as ours but why <I>any</I> past should count as ours. . .
  . the history we study is never our own; it is always the history of people
  who were in some respects like us and in other respects different.  When,
  however, we claim it as ours, we commit ourselves to the ontology of 'the
  Negro,' to the identity of 'we' and 'they' and the primacy of race&quot;
  (128).  Thus, <I>&quot;instead of who we are being </I>constituted by what
  we do, what we do is justified by who we are&quot; (140; my emphasis).
    Such pluralism or identity-essentialism, Michaels believes, is itself
  the thinly veiled racism we now practice.</P>
  <P>But to what extent is &quot;who we are&quot; determined by &quot;what
  we do&quot;?  As the Austrian and German Jews found out by 1932 or '33,
  what they &quot;did&quot;--which was pretty much what all other Germans
  did--cut no ice with the Nazis,  no matter how well-educated, assimilated,
   baptized, church-going, or blond and blue-eyed they might have been. 
  And what about Bosnia, where the Serbs have brutally murdered and raped
  women identified simply by the signifier of gender as <I>women</I>, never
  mind what these women had <I>said</I> or <I>done?</I>    In an imperfect
  world, as the history of our brutal century has taught us, identity is
  largely a question of how others perceive us.  And that perception depends,
  in turn, on a host of psychological, political, and cultural factors, with
  each case being slightly different.</P>
  <P>It is this sense of difference that brings us back--or it should bring
  us back--to the question of the <I>literary</I>.  What is literature anyway
  and why should we study it?  On the last page of <I>Our America</I>, we
  read:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>. . . nativist modernism invented a new form of racism and produced
    a new model 	not 	only of American identity but of the other identitities
    that would now be available in 	America. . . . Because that conception
    of culture found its fullest expression as a literary 	phenomenon and (not,
    in my view, coincidentally) because the decade of the '20s 		produced a
    great number of exceptionally interesting literary works, I have focused
    	most of my attention on American literary modernism.  Whether or not the
    privileged 	position of literature as the carrier of cultural heritage
    is enviable, it is real and, even 	though it would certainly be useful
    to deal with a range of phenomena wider than I have 	attempted, I believe
    that any account of nativist modernism would end up making 	American literary
    history central  (141-42).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The assumptions behind this eloquent conclusion deserve to be unpacked.
   Why, to begin with, should &quot;literature&quot; be the &quot;privileged&quot;
  &quot;carrier of cultural heritage&quot;?  Why not music or the visual
  arts or historiography?   More important: the notion of &quot;literature&quot;
  as a &quot;carrier&quot; (it sounds like a vaccine!) implies that it dispenses
  something outside and above literature that is &quot;real&quot; and can
  be accessed by means of a verbal conduit.  But what and where is this really
  real that the literary vaccine injects?</P>
  <P>&quot;The decade of the '20s,&quot; Michaels insists, &quot;produced
  a great number of exceptionally interesting literary works.&quot; A strange
  statement, this, coming from an anti-aestheticist like Michaels.   For
  what is it that makes &quot;literary works&quot; &quot;interesting&quot;?
  And what is it that makes interesting works &quot;literary&quot;?  Since
  Michaels refuses all qualitative criteria, confuting, as the dust jacket
  of <I>Our America</I> puts it, &quot;the canonical, the popular, and the
  less familiar,&quot; we can only conclude that what makes certain literary
  works of the 1920s &quot;exceptionally interesting&quot; is that they exemplify
  the nativism that is Michaels's subject.  Those works of the 1920s that
  don't so exemplify--say Stevens's &quot;The Snow Man&quot; or Crane's &quot;Voyages,&quot;
  or  Stein's portrait of C&eacute;zanne -- are evidently not &quot;exceptionally
  interesting.&quot;  And evidently they are not &quot;literary&quot; either
  since they are not privileged &quot;carriers&quot; of the nativist message.
   </P>
  <P>&quot;I believe,&quot; writes Michaels, &quot;that any account of nativist
  modernism would end up making American literary history central.&quot;
   Here is the salvage operation by which Michaels's brand of cultural studies
  would like to save literature, to preserve it as a field of study.  But
  it will not do.  For why do we need to study literature in order to learn
  about the identity politics of the1920s?  Surely there are more informative
  and efficient ways than to read dozens of what are largely undistinguished
  novels.  What, in other words, can &quot;literature&quot; teach us that
  the study of American history, culture, and politics can't?  Indeed, I
  would posit that if literature has no other function than to be the privileged
  &quot;carrier of cultural heritage,&quot; its study will soon be an anachronism.
   If we can offer our students nothing better than the moral imperative
  to read the novels of Nella Larsen and Jean Toomer and Willa Cather because
  they will teach us about the &quot;cultural heritage&quot; that they &quot;carry,&quot;
  the response is likely to be a collective and extended yawn.  What nineteen-year
  old will be impelled to read lesser novels written seventy years ago on
  that argument?  </P>
  <P>The study of literature, modernist or otherwise, needs better justification
  than Michaels gives it.   The fascination exerted by, say, <I>The Sound
  and the Fury</I> is that it is at once utterly specific and documentary
  (one can go to Oxford, Mississipi and photograph the buildings that people
  Faulkner's universe) and yet entirely imaginary, mythological, and fantastic.
   Insofar as the novel embodies nativist notions of miscegenation and reproductive
  marriage, it resembles the work of any number of lesser novelists, as Michaels
  points out.  But if we regard the glass as half full rather than half empty,
  we would have to go further and say, yes but look at the astonishing subtlety
  of Faulkner's treatment of the nativist theme.   Again, if the nativist
  project were all, why the astonishing linguistic invention that characterizes
  <I>The Sound and the Fury</I>?  Why not just substitute a Cliff-Notes 
  pr&eacute;cis for the novel?  Surely the &quot;ideas&quot; remain intact.
   And at the ideological level, it may well be the case that Faulkner's
  novel is no more &quot;interesting&quot; than La Farge's <I>Laughing Boy</I>,
  which dates from the same year (1929).</P>
  <P>Ironically, then, Michaels' contention that the notion of a racialized
  identity will emerge as &quot;the crucial feature of modernism&quot; (p.
  141),  is itself nothing if not an essentialist, indeed an inadvertently
  racist, claim.</P>
  <P>For modernism does not, cannot belong to the United States alone, much
  less to any segment of U. S. culture or decade of U. S. writing.   Modernism,
  as I noted above, goes back at least as far as Baudelaire and Manet in
  France and includes the poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and fiction of Andrey
  Bely at least as much as it includes the fiction of Hemingway and Fitzgerald.
   To cordon off American modernism, not to mention the fiction of the American1920s,
  from the larger world  in which it functioned is to assume the existence
  of a national (and hence also racial) purity, an ethos that separates &quot;us&quot;
  from &quot;them.&quot;  </P>
  <P>But even if we could define American modernism according to its time
  frame, nationality, and set of family resemblances, it is impossible to
  assert that it has one &quot;crucial feature.&quot;   Michaels knows this
  well enough, knows that his discussion of nativist modernism has less to
  do with the 1920s than with what he perceives to be the regressive identity
  politics of our own day.  But in insisting that nativism, with its attendant
  racism is &quot;the crucial feature&quot; of American modernism, Michaels
  is doing no more than perpetuating a narrow stereotype of Americanness.
    Broaden the base, substitute Gertrude Stein's <I>Geography and Plays</I>
  (1922) for Carl Van Vechten's <I>Nigger Heaven</I>, or Djuna Barnes's Greenwich
  Village sketches and short stories for Sherwood Anderson's <I>Dark Laughter</I>
  (1925) and watch the map of American modernism change its shape.</P>
  <P>Paradoxically, <I>Our America</I>  will thus be of interest chiefly
  to those already committed to the racialized identity politics Michaels
  claims to  be critiquing.   Its prerequisite is a familiarity with the
  ethnic literature of the 1920s --a literature that stakes its claim  precisely
  on racial and cultural grounds.  But for those of us who are not racial
  purists and who do not subscribe to the &quot;cultural heritage&quot; theory
  of literary texts,  <I>Our </I>America is not so much wrong-headed as it
  is tautological.  Race is always and only race.   But then what?  &quot;The
  difference,&quot; as Gertrude Stein (and, by the way, just what was her
  racial identity?) put it in <I>Tender Buttons</I>, &quot;is spreading.&quot;
