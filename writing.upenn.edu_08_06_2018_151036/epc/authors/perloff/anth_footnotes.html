  <P><A NAME="1"></A>1. These will be subsequently cited in the text as DA,
  EW, PH, and DM. </P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="2"></A>2. I put &quot;younger&quot; in quotes because both
  editors understand that there are &quot;older&quot; (in years) but still
  beginner poets who belong in these groupings.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="3"></A>3. Strictly speaking, Volume 1 of the Oblek anthology
  is called <I>Presentation</I> and is edited by Gizzi and McGrath; Volume
  2, <I>Technique</I>, by Gizzi and Spahr. Volume 1 is devoted to poems,
  but Volume 2 is not all critical prose; it too includes poem-manifestos,
  and so on.</P>

  <P><A NAME="4"></A>4. The Grove Press had, by 1960, a reputation as an
  avant-garde (e.g., Samuel Beckett) and underground (e.g. Henry Miller,
  William Burroughs) publisher that brought out primarily foreign novels
  (the <I>nouveau roman</I> of Robbe-Grillet, Sarraute, Butor, etc.) and
  plays (Marguerite Duras), as well as &quot;unpublishable&quot; avant-garde
  works. But they had not undertaken to represent American poets until Allen
  put out his anthology.</P>

  <P><A NAME="5"></A>5. See my &quot;Charles Olson and the 'Inferior Predecessors':
  Projective Verse Revisited,&quot; ELH, 40 (197 3): 285-306.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="6"></A>6. Donald Allen has told me in conversation that this
  was the case. The anthology is subsequently cited as GB.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="7"></A>7. The fifteen eliminated are Helen Adam, Ebbe Borregaard,
  Bruce Boyd, Ray Bremser, James Broughton, Paul Carroll, Kirby Doyle, Richard
  Duerden, Edward Field, Madeline Gleason, Philip Lamantia, Edward Marshall,
  Peter Orlovsky, Stuart Z. Perkoff, Gilbert Sorrentino. </P>

  <P><A NAME="9"></A>9. John Yau, &quot;Neither Us nor Them,&quot; <I>American
  Poetry Review</I>, 23, no. 2 (March/April 1994): 45-54. Subsequently cited

  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="10"></A>10. It is interesting that Jed Rasula, discussing the
  Weinberger anthology in an essay published in 1995 (&quot;The Empire's
  New Clothes: Anthologizing American Poetry in the 1990s,&quot; <I>American
  </I>Literary History, 7, no. 2 [Summer 1995]: 261-283), but evidently written
  before 1993, when Hoover and Messerli, not to mention Gizzi and Ganick
  brought out their volumes, holds up Weinberger as the voice crying in the
  wilderness, poised against the philistine others, especially J. D. McClatchy's
  <I>Vintage Book of Contemporary American Poetry</I>, (New York: Random
  House,1990). Rasula admits that Weinberger &quot;does not . . . address
  the issue of cultural imperialism&quot; (p. 273), but, he suggests, if
  the choice is between <I>Innovators and </I>Outsiders and McClatchy's <I>Vintage
  Book</I>, Weinberger's cultural &quot;blindness&quot; is regarded as a
  minor fault. </P>
  <P>There is a cautionary tale here: we must beware making large generalizations
  about such matters as the state of poetry in late twentieth-century consumer
  culture for, before we know it, the situation we describe just may have
  changed. So it is that between the writing of Rasula's essay and its publication
  two or three years later, language poetry and related radical poetries,
  long poised on the brink of recognition, suddenly took off. Which is not
  to say that the mainstream poetry scene Rasula describes isn't still the
  dominant one. </P>

  Third Edition, Volume 2, ed Nina Baym et. al. (New York: Norton, 1989).
  The editors responsible for the poetry sections ae David Kalstone and William
  H. Pritchard.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="12"></A>12. In a review of Paul Hoover's <I>Norton Anthology
  of Postmodern Poetry</I> for <I>The New Criterion</I>, 13 (June 1995):
  68-78, John Haines dismisses Olson as a poet of &quot;formlessness,&quot;
  &quot;posturing,&quot; and &quot;self-promotion,&quot; whose &quot;oddities
  of phrasing,&quot; and &quot;straining after effect,&quot; are just so
  much &quot;gibberish&quot; (p. 70). Granted that <I>The New Criterion</I>
  represents the acme of reactionary discourse on poetry, my point is that
  there was no parallel in the 1950s and 60s. There were, of course, reactionary
  journals then as now, but although, say, Williams may have been dismissed
  as rather negligible in these journals, he was not dismissed, as Haines
  declares Olson to be, unfit for inclusion in a comparable anthology.</P>

  Edition, ed. Richard Ellmann and Robert O'Clair (New York: Norton, 1989).</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="14"></A>14. The omission suggests to me that Messerli is adhering
  to his own very particular language poetics more rigorously than he cares
  to admit in his introduction. Evidently, he for one does see that Levertov's
  is hardly the poetics of the countercurrent it has been taken to be..</P>

  11, 1957, Williams Collection, Beinecke Library, Yale University, cited
  in James E. B. Breslin (ed.), &quot;Introduction,&quot; <I>Something to
  Say: </I>William Carlos Williams on Younger Poets (New York: New Directions,

  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="17"></A>17. James Laughlin explained this to me in conversation.
  Levertov is one of a small number of New Directions authors who has this
  privilege.</P>

  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="19"></A>19. In <I>A Map of Misreading</I> (New York: Oxford,
  1965), Bloom makes a central distinction between &quot;strong poets,&quot;
  of whom Stevens is the most important twentieth-century exemplar (and whose
  heirs Ammons and Ashbery are) and &quot;major innovators&quot; like Pound
  and Williams, &quot;who may never touch strength at all&quot; (p. 9).</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="20"></A>20. <I>From the Other Side of the Century </I>includes
  five Canadian poets : David Bromige, Nicole Brossard, Christopher Dewdney,
  Steve McCaffery, and bp nichol. In the case of Hoover's <I>Postmodern American
  Poetry</I>, the decision not to include Canadian poets was evidently the
  publisher's.</P>

  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="22"></A>22. The CD is disappointing, there being no explanation
  of the eclectic mix of poets represented, many of whom (e.g., Alice Notley,
  Kenward Elmslie) are not in the book at all and some, like the Jack Spicer
  &quot;Imaginary Elegies&quot; (1957), and John Ashbery's &quot;'They Dream
  Only of America'&quot; (1962), stemming from earlier decades. One could
  argue that the aim here, as in the book, is to produce telling juxtapositions,
  but in practice, the sequence from Michael Palmer to Ted Berrigan creates
  more confusion than insight.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><A NAME="23"></A>23. Ming-Quian Ma, a Chinese doctoral candidate at
  Stanford, who has published essays on Carl Rakosi, George Oppen, Susan
  Howe, and Lyn Hejinian, and who is working on further translations of the
  &quot;Original&quot; poets with Jeff Twitchell, tells me that in the original,
  the poems in question are much more non-syntactic and disjunctive than
  in these translations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
