<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>Video art has now been around for over thirty
years but in the world of literary and cultural studies, one would
barely know it.   Television as medium and television culture
have, of course, been endlessly dissected: from Raymond Williams's
 <I>Television, Technology and Cultural Form</I> (1974)
 and Louis Althusser's study of &quot;Ideological State Apparatuses&quot;
(1971) to Baudrillard's &quot;Requiem for the Media&quot; (1981),
and, more recently, to such essay collections as Constance Penley
and Andrew Ross's <I>Technoculture </I> (1991) and Gretchen
Bender and Timothy Druckrey's <I>Culture on the Brink: Ideologies
of Technology</I> (1994), a whole library of studies has grown
up that unmask TV discourses, power mechanisms and markets, ideological
control, and especially, in recent years, media representations
of race, gender, class, and ethnicity.   Video, it seems from
this flood of media critique, is that which is seen on broadcast
TV--period.
<P>
 Even in the art world, where video pieces are, of course, exhibited,
discussed, and studied,  video art has been accused of &quot;technocratic
idealism&quot;;  &quot;an uneasy relationship,&quot; in Benjamin
Buchloch's words, &quot;with the institutions of reception and
distribution of the high-art avant-garde--the museum and the gallery--and
an even uneasier one with the customers of the distribution system,
the private collectors.&quot;  &quot;Many of the potentially most
progressive features of the medium,&quot; says Buchloch, &quot;have
by now turned out to be a trap for the artists who find themselves
caught between the vigorous reaffirmation of traditional values
and techniques in the worlds of high-art . . . and an attitude
of increasing certainty that culture, consumption, and ideology
are congruent.&quot; Only when the video maker recognizes this
complicity and engages in direct political critique, as in Dan
Graham's <I>Rock my Religion</I>  or Martha Rosler's <I>A
Simple Case for Torture</I>, does video art become useful
and interesting.
<P>
 This argument is itself undercut by a naive Utopianism.  For
surely the number of viewers who take in an agitprop video like
Rosler's <I>Simple Case for Torture</I> or Dara Birnbaum's
<I>Damnation of Faust</I> (both 1983) is by no means greater
than those who look at videos by Nam June Paik or John Baldessari;
in either case, the audience is hardly the audience that watches
<I>Wheel of Fortune</I> or <I>Beverly Hills Cop</I>
 or <I>even Masterpiece Theatre</I>.  Indeed, no artist
today would make the undue claim that video art has the power
to subvert, much less overturn, the vast circuitry of mass television.
 No technical tool--whether paint brush, pencil, chisel, or lithographic
stone--is in itself the means to a revolutionary art.  Walter
Benjamin,we recall, insisted that film was inherently a more subversive
form than Dada or Surrealist painting, because painting, however
&quot;provocative&quot; its images and daring its &quot;word salad,&quot;
was &quot;in no position to present an object for simultaneous
collective experience.&quot;   But within a decade of Benjamin's
death, the films distributed for &quot;simultaneous collective
experience&quot; had become at least as commercial and commodified
as the art forms they had replaced,  a prime exemplar, for that
matter, of what the Frankfurt school scornfully dubbed the consciousness
industry.
<P>
 What tends to be ignored in all these discussions about the &quot;revolutionary&quot;
potential (or lack thereof) of this or that new medium is that,
once a given medium is in place--as was the case with photography
in the mid-nineteenth century, film in the early twentieth, and
today, the various digital technologies--the most interesting
artists will naturally gravitate toward it, exploring its potential
and displacing attention, at least for a time, from the more conventional
media.  Then, too, the return, say, to painting, once a medium
like video is in place, will obviously produce a different kind
of painting, just as post-film theatre has adapted certain filmic
qualities in its staging, scenic design, and spatial relationships.
<P>
 How, we might begin by asking, does video art relate to its most
immediate relatives, television and film?  In one of the first
(and still best) considerations of the distinctive features of
video, David Antin discusses the use of <I>time</I> in
broadcast television: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>For television, time has an absolute existence independent
of any imagery that may or  may not be transmitted over its well-defended
airwaves and cables.  It is television's  only solid, a tangible
commodity that is precisely divisible into further and further
 subdivisible homogeneous units, the smallest quantum of which
is measured by the  smallest segment that could be purchased by
a potential advertiser, which is itself  defined by the minimum
particle required to isolate a salable product from among a  variable
number of equivalent alternatives.  The smallest salable piece
turns out to be  the ten-second spot, and all television is assembled
from it.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
And Antin goes on to show, with great wit and finesse, how the
medium is driven by the extreme segmentation of transmission time
mainly through the intense development of multiple sponsorship.
&quot;What is called news on television,&quot; for example, &quot;is
a chain of successive, distinct, and structurally unrelated narrations
called stories.  These average from thirty seconds to two minutes
in length, are usually presented in successions of three or four
in a row, and are bracketed between packets of commercials from
one to two minutes long&quot; (DA 158).   As minute segments proliferate,
the distinction between commercials and programs breaks down,
in that &quot;every genre of program appears also as a commercial:
Dramas, comedies, documentaries, science talks, lists, all show
up in thirty-and sixty-second forms&quot; (DA 159).  The resulting
linear succession of logically independent units of nearly equal
duration is the basic syntax of television, as we all know it.
 And although Antin wrote his essay before the advent of cable
TV, it is amazing how little difference cable has made in the
time sequence as he describes it.
<P>
 To turn from television to artist's videotapes is thus, as Antin
notes, a strange experience.  Viewers not accustomed to such videos
tend to find them long and boring, even when their running time
is actually shorter than that of the standard commercial.  The
perception of &quot;length&quot; has everything to do with the
way &quot;normal&quot; TV presents its ten or thirty-second &quot;message,&quot;
so that absence of fixed &quot;content&quot; becomes peculiarly
disconcerting, and a startling form of defamiliarization occurs.
 In forcing the viewer to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;hear&quot;
 what may be &quot;normal&quot; television images at a different
speed and rate of transformation, avant-garde video may well constitute,
as the curator David Ross has observed ,&quot;the only  meaningful
critique of television's form and practice.&quot; 
<P>
 If time in video art is thus significantly different from TV
time (and I will exemplify this in a moment), it also deviates
significantly from film time.  In a 1981 catalogue essay called
&quot;The Porcupine and the Car,&quot;  Bill Viola explains it
this way:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> Looking at the technical development of both video
and film, we immediately notice a  profound difference: as film
has evolved basically out of photography (a film is a  succession
of discrete photographs),  video has emerged from audio technology.
 A video  camera is closer to a microphone in operation than it
is to a film camera; video images  are recorded on magnetic tape
in a tape recorder.  Thus we find that video is closer in  relationship
to sound, or music [and I would interject here, to a verbal art
like poetry]</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> than it is to the visual media of film and photography.
. . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  One of the most fascinating aspects of video's
technical evolution, and the one that  makes it most different
from film, is that the video image existed for many years before
 a way was developed to record it. . . . Taping or recording is
not an integral part of the  system.  Film is not film unless
it is filming (recording).  Video, however, is  &quot;videoing&quot;
all the time, continually in motion, putting out 30 frames, or
images, a  second. . . .<I> Video's roots in the live, not
recorded, is the underlying characteristic of the </I> <I>medium.</I>
 Somehow, in a way no one has really been able to explain time
becomes more  precious when dealing with video. . . . When one
makes a videotape, one is interfering  with an ongoing process,
the scanning of the camera. . . . In film . . . the basic illusion
is  of movement, produced by the succession of still images flashing
on the screen.  In video,   stillness is the basic illusion: a
still image does not exist because the video signal is in  constant
motion scanning across the screen.  (PC 62-63, my emphasis).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Perhaps the easiest way to understand the distinction Viola is
trying to make is to think of film in its original definition
as a <I>motion picture</I>, the succession of still images
composed so as to produce the illusion of motion, whereas the
video camera as <I>scanner</I> operates the other way around.
 As a cousin to the microphone, the video camera, as many artists
have testified, becomes a kind of prosthesis, an extension of
the body that exists to record what is out there.  And since,
given the nature of the video signal, supplying &quot;realistic&quot;
renditions of specific events is no longer a problem, the real
challenge for the video artist is to use electronic editing (available
since the mid-seventies), to <I>leave out</I>.  Whereas
film is an art of <I>composition</I>, of framing, arrangement,
structuring, so as to create a particular set of images, video
is, Viola suggests, an information art.   Given the current glut
of books, magazines, newspapers, radio and television programs,
records, videotapes, films, and so on in our culture, he points
out, &quot;the major task of today is not information production
but information management&quot; or retrieval. . . . In this light,
the main problem for artists using video these days lies in deciding
what <I>not</I> to record.  Making a videotape, therefore,
might not be so much the creation or building up of some thing,
but more like the cutting or carving away of everything else until
only a specific thing remains&quot; (PC 60).   The most interesting
connections, in this regard, become those between &quot;areas
of low, or ambiguous, information, so-called 'gaps' in recognition&quot;
that involve the participation of the viewer.  &quot;The process
of learning itself,&quot; as Viola puts it, &quot;demands that
initially one must be confronted with something one does not understand&quot;
(PC 67).  And he cites Ren&eacute; Magritte's well-known comment:
&quot;People who look for symbolic meanings fail to grasp the
inherent poetry and mystery of the image.  No doubt they sense
this mystery, but they wish to get rid of it.  They are afraid.
 By asking 'what does this mean?' they express a wish that everything
be understandable.  But if one does not reject the mystery, one
has quite a different response.  One asks other things.&quot;
<P>
 Let us see how this works in a specific Viola video.  In 1986,
the artist released an eighty-nine-minute videotape called <I>I
Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like</I>, the title taken from
the <I>Rig Veda</I>.  It has five &quot;chapters&quot;:
&quot;Il Corpo Scuro&quot; (The Dark Body), &quot;The Language
of the Birds,&quot; &quot;The Night of Sense,&quot; &quot;Stunned
by the Drum,&quot; and &quot;The Living Flame,&quot; all of them
related by a concern for the relationship of human to animal consciousness
within a natural world of great extremes with respect to climate
and topography.  The video was two years in the making:  during
part of that time, Viola was artist-in-residence at the San Diego
Zoo.   Some of the images were gathered in places as far apart
as Wind Cave National Park, and Jewell Cave National Monument
in South Dakota, where Viola spent several weeks scanning the
movements of a freely roaming herd of buffalo and studying cave
formations, a glacial lake near Banff in the Canadian Rockies,
and the Mahadevi Hindu Temple on the island of Fiji, where Viola
attended a week-long firewalking ritual.  
<P>
 But in this parodic nature documentary (a brilliant deconstruction
of documentaries like PBS's <I>Nova</I>  as well as of
TV travelogues), the exotica are never far removed from the scanning
of the artist's own study in Long Beach, California--a rather
ordinary room with a large desk, on which sit a fluorescent swivel
lamp.  We first see the artist in chapter 2, reflected in the
pupil of the owl, whose watchful presence (see figure 14.1) is
one of the highpoints of <I>I Do Not Know</I>.  In chapter
3, we see Viola sitting at his desk for minutes at a time, reading
and taking notes as he studies the footage of the preceding bird
sequence on a tiny monitor (see figure 14.2).  A coffee mug, a
pencil, a rock, a little gold jewelry casket, an egg--these are
situated on the desk or the neighboring table.   Occasionally
a cat meows and a dog barks somewhere out of sight.  This quiet
sequence is followed by the artist's solitary late-night dinner,
a slow motion scene that begins as a kind of Dutch still life
and gradually becomes a Swiftian cartoon in its huge close-ups
of the artist's knife and fork dissecting an ordinary fish--a
fish that in turn defamiliarizes those in the blow-ups we have
seen in slow-motion in the prior chapter, the artist himself reflected
in the giant pupils of their huge eyes.  In the eating sequence,
an ominous silence is punctuated by loud intermittent cutting,
crackling, and swallowing sounds that suggest large-scale dismemberment.

<P>
 In a diary entry of 1980, Viola writes: &quot;I want to look
so close at things that their intensity burns through your retina
and onto the surface of your mind.  The video camera is well suited
to looking closely at things, elevating the commonplace to higher
levels of awareness.  I want each image to be the first image,
to shine with the intensity of its own first-born being&quot;
(RKW 78).  And he cites, as he frequently does, Rilke's lines,
&quot;When a question is posed ceremoniously, / the universe responds.&quot;
<P>
 But the &quot;closeness of things&quot; is based on sound as
much as it is on light.  &quot;We usually think of the camera,&quot;
says Viola, &quot;as an 'eye' and the microphone as an 'ear,'
but all the senses exist simultanenously in our bodies, interwoven
into one system that includes sensory data, neural processing,
memory, imagination, and all the mental events of the moment.
 This all adds up to create the larger phenomenon we call experience&quot;
(RKW 151-52).  In <I>I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like</I>,
reflection plays a central role:  the artist sees his reflection
in the chrome of the kitchen faucet, in the eyes of fish, buffalo,
and birds, in a glass of water on his desk that turns out to have
a miniature tree in it--everywhere there are black pupils that
give the artist his self-image even as the sounds of water and
wind, intermittent barking and chirping create a disquieting counterpoint
to the visual.   In Viola's work, sound and image are never fully
in sync.
<P>
 One especially arresting sequence, about halfway through the
video, follows the tracking of a snail, emerging very slowly,
first one antenna and then the other, from the little gold jewelry
box (it looks like a miniature version of Cleopatra's golden barge)
on the polished wooden table (see figure 14.3).  Again, the allusion
is to still life, this time Surrealist rather than seventeenth-century,
but the still life comes to life in a frightening way--all the
more frightening because what happens is quite normal.  As the
snail moves out of the field of vision, the camera focuses on
an egg we have seen sitting on the artist's table in an earlier
shot of his study.  Only now that perfect white egg--an elegant
shape like an Arp or Brancusi sculpture, a shape that fills up
two thirds of the screen and is seen against a totally plain background,
has a crack in it.  (figure 14.4).   
<P>
 The individual segments in the egg sequence are in real time
but the tape is edited so that some phases of the hatching process
are omitted.  The slow but sure cracking of the egg is, to my
mind, an image as fearful as it is astonishing.   One wants--at
least I want--the egg to look perfect and pristine  again, one
wants that irritating scar to disappear.    And at first the crack
is so small that closure seems possible.  For a moment, in a painterly
blow-up, we seem to be looking at a white-on-white abstract composition
with broken texture--an Antoni T&agrave;pies perhaps.  But when
the egg begins to rock, when the silence (throughout the sequence
a very faint hum is heard) is broken by an almost imperceptible
infant's cry, when movement (of what we don't yet know) appears
inside the shell, and when the wet and  yellow feathers are glimpsed
inside it, we know it's all over.  The bits of eggshell litter
the previously clean table, the yellowish membrane behind the
shell flutters, and now the crack cuts the egg in two.  We hear
the faint monotonous chirping of the chick and it emerges from
its shell, as grotesque a creature as one can imagine (figure
4.5).   The camera slowly scans its face and eye, and then its
claws with their long hideous humanoid nails, wiggling and reaching
up into the air, even as the shell becomes barely visible behind
it.  And now the camera finally cuts away, resting its eye on
another white shape, this time the coffee mug--a manufactured
object, whose whiteness and shiny smooth surface provides a stark
contrast to the egg.  
<P>
 The egg-and-chicken sequence is, of course, designed to be seen
and heard as part of the larger composition, but even in itself
it has striking features.  First, its normalcy--what is it but
a chicken hatched from its egg?--in a curiously abnormal setting
of a table top. Second, its perfectly obvious struggle-of-birth
symbolism, rather like that in William Carlos Williams's <I>Spring
and All</I>:  &quot;Rooted we grip down / and begin to awaken.&quot;
 Third, its also obvious eroticism:  the dilating opening, the
breaking of the membrane, the not quite visible moving organ within.
  And the contrast, in this connection, between the smooth exterior
and the mysterious interior, a kind of heart of darkness, audible
before it is visible.
<P>
 But such connections are only a first step in assessing Viola's
composition.  In alternately speeding up the birth cycle (all
steps in the cycle are not photographed) and slowing it down (shifting
to real time in the case of each shot), the artist asks the viewer/listener
to consider what &quot;birth&quot; means.  No adorable chickens
here as in TV advertising, no paeans to the &quot;incredible,
edible egg.&quot;  And no tribute to the &quot;beauty&quot; of
labor as in a still shot in <I>The Family of Man</I> or
in one of those elegant TV documentaries about &quot;birth.&quot;
  Who wants to be born, one wonders, more important, who wants
to give birth when this is what it's like?.   And yet the tape
bears no signs of artistic manipulation: It really <I>is</I>
the thing itself, as witnessed by the video camera and re-witnessed
by us.  The artist has not composed his picture as would a filmmaker;
he has not added shadows or enhanced the resolution.  His focus
is less on image as such than on <I>time</I>-- the time
it takes for the shell to crack, for the first chirp to be heard,
for the egg to shake, for the membrane to burst. The whole segment
lasts only five minutes, shorter than the 8.25 local news broadcast,
but it seems to take an eternity, as our eyes take in what they
normally--and purposely--miss.  Here slow-down is as important
as speed-up.  For seconds, almost a minute, at a time, nothing
changes so that the sudden  breaking of the shell is as dramatic
as sudden movement after stasis is in a Noh drama.
<P>
 A videotape like Viola's <I>I Do Not Know</I><I> </I>also
foregrounds what we might call a fractal sense of reality.   Viola
does not literally use fractal geometry in his work,  but his
aesthetic makes much of the &quot;fractals&quot; or irregular
fragments perceived in nature when we refine our ways of measuring
and describing what we see.  &quot;Clouds,&quot; as Benoit Mandelbrot
remarks in his Introduction to <I>The Fractal Geometry of Nature</I>,
&quot;are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are
not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel
in a straight line. . . . Nature exhibits not simply a higher
degree but an altogether different level of complexity. . . .
.The existence of these patterns challenges us to study those
forms that Euclid leaves aside as being 'formless,' to investigate
the morphology of the 'amorphous.'&quot;  Thus the length of a
curve--say, the length of the coastline of Britain, to take Mandelbrot's
famous example, will vary according to what principle of measurement
we apply to it.  Far from being the total of individual segments
of coast line, length varies according to the scale of units to
be included: the greater the detail, which is to say, the smaller
the measurable sub-bays and sub-peninsulas, the greater the difficulty
in assigning anything like a &quot;true length&quot; to the coast
line's curve (BM 25-26).
<P>
 Much of Viola's reductionism, his slow, patient analysis of a
buffalo's eye or the branches of a tree, have to do with this
new form of &quot;fractal&quot; measure.  Look at a standard travel
poster featuring a glacial lake and the blue oval, surrounded
by snowy mountains, will not seem all that remarkable.  But now
take the same lake and focus on an inch of rippling lake water
and all sorts of things become apparent.  Again, the dialectic
here is with television on the one hand, film on the other.  In
a given film, the minute particle of lake water would function
as a telling detail:  it might, for example, refer us to the body
drowned on this spot, and the camera would soon get on with it,
relating this detail to the larger narrative structure.   In commercial
TV, the detail (say, water bubbles), would function as a signifier:
 once recognized (look, it's Glacier Lake!) it would be replaced
by, say, the bottle of Evian, which represents its real value
or by the Chateau Lake Louise which represents its real use as
a vacation setting..  But in video, as Viola sees it,  the aim
is to slow down the viewer's attention and witness what has always
already been there but never quite seen.  In the words of Viola's
favorite poet William Blake, &quot;If the doors of perception
were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.&quot;
 
<P>
 Viola is much given to citing Blake, Rilke, and other poets 
and to referring to his own work as &quot;poetic.&quot; From the
early <I>Songs of Innocence </I>(1978), a visual counterpart
to Blake's poems, to the recent <I>D&eacute;serts</I> (1994),
based on the sound landscape of Edgar Var&egrave;se's music, Viola
has expressed the desire to give his video piece &quot;a form
of visual poetry.&quot; (RKW 263).   And <I>Slowly Turning
Narrative</I>, a two-channel video installation that juxtaposes
a large screen, a mirrored surface on one side, to a normal projection
screen on the other, uses as voice-over a set of anaphoric lineated
phrases, recited slowly and deliberately by Viola.  In the course
of this monologue, the opening phrase &quot;the one who goes,&quot;
undergoes dozens of permutations. as &quot;the one who discovers
/ the one who does / the one who fights / the one who fears&quot;
or again, as &quot;the one who spits / the one who pisses / the
one who blinks / the one who hears / the one who touches&quot;
(RKW 228-31).  Text and image are closely related.
<P>
 What makes such an installation &quot;poetic&quot;? Is &quot;poetic&quot;
just another epithet for &quot;imaginative&quot; or &quot;moving&quot;
or &quot;intense&quot;?  Or does Viola's video have some more
meaningful relation to &quot;poetry&quot;?  My own take on this
difficult question is that the attraction poetry has had for Viola
is that it provides video with a turn away from the merely visual.
 &quot;Traditionally in television,&quot; he remarks, &quot;fidelity
has been to vision, to the visual image and not to reality, and
rarely to the retinal image in the eyeball. . . . The human visual
image is binocular, it includes overlapping areas, double images,
indistinct edges, and only a very small part of the center, called
the fovea, shows focus in rich detail.  Of course, human software,
the mind, integrates this with information from the other senses.
. . . The camera only sees three faces of a cube, for example,
yet our hands can tell us that the other three simultaneously
exist&quot; (RKW 221).
<P>
 The <I>poetic</I> thus translates roughly as the <I>other</I>,
the <I>visionary</I>--the missing piece in the puzzle,
the fourth dimension that &quot;normal&quot; television can never
convey.  It is a surprisingly Romantic notion,  as is Viola's
repeated insistence that, finally, video art must use the latest
technology--hardware and software--to enhance the &quot;development
and understanding of the self.&quot;  &quot;This,&quot; Viola
insists, &quot;is where the really hard work is.  The level of
use of the tools is a direct reflection of the level of the user.
 Chopsticks can either be a simple eating utensil or a deadly
weapon, depending on who uses them&quot; (RKW 71).
<P>
 Such claims for video as the medium of self-discovery, its potential
for transcendence and &quot;poetic&quot; vision, may well strike
us as excessive.    But perhaps Viola's drive to videate poetry
and poeticize video, to transfer, for example, Blake's <I>Songs
of Innocence</I> to the video screen, not by reproducing the
poet's words, much less by talking <I>about</I> the poetry,
 but by inventing a visual and sonic analogue that can serve as
intertext, is best understood as a form of pragmatism.  In a piece
called &quot;Between How and Why&quot; (1993), Viola observes:

<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>The new technologies of image-making are by necessity
bringing us back to  fundamental questions, whether we want to
face them or not.   The development of  schemes for the creation
of images with computers is an investigation into the structure
  and fabric of the world we observe and participate in. . . Faced
with the content of the  direct images and sounds of life in one's
daily practice as an artist, questions of form,  visual appearance,
and the &quot;how&quot; of image-making drop away.  You realize
that the real  work for this time is not abstract, theoretical,
and speculative-- it is urgent, moral,  and practical&quot;  (RKW
257).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Urgent, moral, and practical:  even as cultural critique continues
to insist that &quot;high&quot; art is dead, that, at the very
least, there is no domain of art distinct from commodification
and popular culture, artists like Viola are rediscovering the
function of art as a form of practical knowledge--in Plato's words
in the <I>Ion</I>, <I>techne kai episteme</I>. 
 At the end of the twentieth century, as Viola puts it, &quot;the
artist is not necessary someone who draws well, but someone who
thinks well.&quot; <BR>

7 <FONT SIZE=2> See David Ross, 'Truth or Consequences: American
Television and Video Art&quot; (1984), in JGH: 169.   Ross follows
Antin in suggesting that all talk of &quot;improving&quot; television
represents a misunderstanding of the way the medium works.  One
might add that the frequently heard complaints of elder statesmen
like Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley that newscasting has &quot;deteriorated&quot;
since their day are irrelevant, television velocity, fuelled by
the increasing competition for viewer attention, creating its
own demands.<BR>

Porcupine and the Car,&quot; RKW 60.  Viola doesn't quote it quite
accurately: he adds a &quot;then&quot; before &quot;every thing,&quot;
runs the words together, and puts a dash before &quot;infinite&quot;
rather than a comma.  For other references to Blake, see RKW,
