<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0603AE" SIZE=+1>January 1931.</font> In the &quot;News Notes&quot; at the back of <I>Poetry</I>
  magazine, Harriet Monroe announced that the February issue would be edited
  by one &quot;Mr. Louis Zukofsky, who has been for several years a prominent
  member of a group of writers interested in experiment in poetic form and
  method. . . . Mr. Zukofsky is recommended on the high authority of Ezra
  Pound and others whose opinions we greatly respect.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#1" target="resource window">1</A>)</FONT> But, having &quot;abdicated [her editorial powers]
  temporarily,&quot; Monroe evidently felt betrayed. In the March issue,
  she wrote an angry response to the &quot;Objectivist&quot; number of <I>Poetry</I>
  called &quot;The Arrogance of Youth.&quot; Zukofsky, she insisted, was
  wrong to &quot;abandon&quot; such big poetry names as E. A. Robinson, Robert
  Frost, Edgar Lee Masters, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, as well as the &quot;once-revolutionary
  imagists.&quot; And &quot;what,&quot; asks Monroe, &quot;are we offered
  in exchange? A few familiar names get by [she is evidently thinking of
  William Carlos Williams's &quot;Botticellian Trees&quot;] though often
  by severely wrenching Mr. Zukofsky's barbed-wire entanglements.&quot; <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#2" target="resource window">2</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>What was the nature of the &quot;Objectivist&quot; experiment, as represented
  by Zukofsky's selection for <I>Poetry</I>, a selection that included, aside
  from the obvious names (Basil Bunting, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, Charles
  Reznikoff, Zukofsky himself), Robert McAlmon and Kenneth Rexroth, Whittaker
  Chambers and Henry Zolinsky, John Wheelright and Martha Champion? And in
  what sense was the work of these poets a departure from that of the &quot;once-revolutionary
  imagists&quot;? Williams, for one, seems to have been skeptical, even though
  Zukofsky's <I>&quot;Objectivists&quot; Antholo</I>gy of the following year
  contains a large selection of his own poems. &quot;Your early poems,&quot;
  he told Zukofsky in a letter of 1928, &quot;even when the thought has enough
  force or freshness, have not been objectivized in new or fresh observations.
  But if it is the music, even that is not inventive enough to make up for
  images which give an overwhelming effect of triteness. . . . The language
  is stilted 'poetic' except in the places I marked. Eyes have always stood
  first in the poet's equipment. If you are mostly ear--a newer rhythm must
come in more strongly than has been the case so far.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a
href="barbed_footnotes.html#3" target="resource window">3</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>As examples of such &quot;stilted 'poetic'&quot; language, Williams
  singles out the phrases &quot;all live processes,&quot; &quot;orbit-trembling,&quot;
  &quot;our consciousness,&quot; and &quot;the sources of being&quot; in
  what he calls Zukofsky's &quot;Lenin poem,&quot; &quot;Memory of V. I.
Ulianov.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#4" target="resource
window">4</A>)</FONT>&quot;It may be,&quot;
  he admits, &quot;that I am too literal in my search for objective clarities
  of image. It may be that you are completely right in forcing abstract conceptions
  into the sound pattern. . . . it may be that when the force of the conception
  is sufficiently strong it can carry this sort of thing. . . . Perhaps by
  my picayune, imagistic mannerisms I hold together superficially what should
  by all means fall apart&quot; (<I>WCWL,</I> 103). </P>
  <P>The recognition that &quot;imagistic mannerisms&quot; may well have
  had their day is echoed by Ezra Pound. Having urged Harriet Monroe to put
  Zukofsky &quot;at the wheel of the Spring cruise,&quot; as he put it in
  a letter, and having &quot;refused to contribute to Aldington's Imagist
  mortology 1930,&quot; which he dismisses as &quot;20 ans apres,&quot; Pound
  urges Zukofsky to make his special issue &quot;a murkn number; excludin
  the so different English.&quot; Indeed, if Zukofsky does his job, Pound
  suggests, <I>Poetry</I> might once again be &quot;what it was in 1912/13,
  the forum in which the Zeitideen WERE presented and discussed.&quot; <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#5" target="resource window">5</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>But the &quot;Zeitideen&quot; of 1931 were, as Pound himself was the
  first to recognize (&quot;Prob[lem] ain't now the same&quot;), no longer
  those of 1913. For one thing, the relationship between tradition and the
  <I>new</I> had become vexed. &quot;The number ought to be NEW line up,&quot;
  Pound repeatedly urges Zukofsky. &quot;You can mention me and old Bill
  Walrus [Williams] in the historic section. . . . I do not think contributions
  from ANYone over 40 shd. be included; and preferably it shd. be confined
  to those under 30&quot; (<I>PZ</I>, 51-52). And he notes acutely, &quot;ONE
  notable difference between yr. position in 1930 and mine in 1910 is that
  you would LIKE to include several older american authors. Bill, Me and
  I suppose Possum Eliot, with Cummings an already known name&quot; (<I>PZ</I>,
  53).</P>
  <P>Zukofsky responded defensively. &quot;The only progress made since 1912,&quot;
  writes the twenty-six-year-old poet to his forty-six-year-old mentor, &quot;is
  or are several good poems, i.e. the only progress possible -- &amp; criteria
  are in your prose works&quot; (<I>PZ</I>, 65). And again, &quot;Think I'll
  have as good a 'movement' as that of the premiers imagistes-- point is
  Wm. C. W. of today is not what he was in 1913, neither are you if you're
  willing to contribute -- if I'm going to show what's going on today, you'll
  have to. The older generation is not the older generation if it's alive
  &amp; up. . . . What's age to do with verbal manifestation, what's history
  to do with it?&quot; (<I>PZ</I>, 67). Which Pound shrugs off laconically:
  &quot;In 1913 les jeunes did not respect their papas. In 1930 there are
  a few middle-aged bokos that we can afford to let live&quot; (<I>PZ</I>,
  74). It was fine, in other words, for Zukofsky to reprint, in his preface
  to the &quot;<I>Objectivists&quot; Anthology,</I> Pound's own Imagist manifesto
  in &quot;A Retrospect&quot; (1912), along with his famous division of poetry
  into three &quot;kinds&quot; (melopoeia, phanopoeia, logopoeia) articulated
  in &quot;How to Read&quot; (1928), and to quote the opening of the newly
  completed Canto XXX (&quot;Compleynt, compleynt I hearde upon a day&quot;).
  And the <I>Anthology</I> is dedicated to Pound, who &quot;is still for
  the poets of our time / the / most important.&quot;</P>
  <P>A certain sense of belatedness--the belatedness usually associated with
  our own postmodern ethos--thus haunts Zukofsky's production. But then &quot;make
  it new!&quot; could hardly be the watchword of a poetic generation that
  came of age in the Great Depression, a generation that understood that
  the &quot;new&quot; was by no means equivalent to the true, much less to
  the good and the beautiful. Just the same, despite Zukofsky's own evident
  inability to articulate the difference between Pound's aesthetic and that
  of the <I>&quot;Objectivists&quot; Anthology</I> that he had assembled,
  there really <I>was </I>something new going on in that anthology, as in
  the little magazines of the early thirties in general. Indeed, with the
  hindsight of the 1990s, the early 1930s were <I>anni mirabiles </I>for
  poetry, as the magazines that now replaced the <I>Dial </I>and <I>Little
  Review</I> (both ceased publication in 1929)--magazines like <I>Blues,</I>
  <I>Morada,</I> the <I>New Review,</I> <I>Furioso,</I> <I>New Masses </I>--
  testify. The <I>&quot;Objectivists&quot;</I> <I>Anthology</I>, for that
  matter, far from being the anomaly Zukofsky and Oppen scholars have often
  taken it to be, was in fact representative of a larger aesthetic that has
  been insufficiently distinguished from its modernist past and its postmodernist
  future. The shift that takes place at the turn of the decade is one from
  the modernist preoccupation with <I>form </I>in the sense of imagistic
  or symbolist structure, dominated by a lyric &quot;I,&quot; to the questioning
  of <I>representation</I> itself. Discourse now becomes increasingly referential,
  but reference does not go hand in hand with the expected mimesis. Rather,
  the boundaries between the &quot;real&quot; and the &quot;fantastic&quot;
  become oddly blurred. The taste for the &quot;natural,&quot; as in Pound's
  insistence that &quot;The natural object is always the adequate symbol,&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#6" target="resource window">6</A>)</FONT> gives way to artifice and a marked
  taste for abstraction and conceptualization. In the same vein irony, so
  central to modernist poetics, gives way to the parodic, but even parody
  is often not sustained, with abrupt tonal shifts and reversals in mood
  becoming quite usual. Indeed, this &quot;time of tension,&quot; to borrow
  Eliot's phrase from his 1930 poem &quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; exhibits a
  mannerist style as distinct from its modernist antecedents as from the
  socialist realism to come.</P>
  <P>In the discussion that follows, I take as my example a single &quot;little
  magazine,&quot; <I>Pagany,</I> which ran for twelve issues between January
  1930 and December 1932, thus coinciding with the darkest years of the Depression,
  from the October 1929 Wall Street crash to the election of Roosevelt and
  the coming of his New Deal in 1932. It was in <I>Pagany</I>, edited by
an affluent young Boston litterateur named Richard Johns, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a
href="barbed_footnotes.html#7" target="resource window">7</A>)</FONT> that
Williams published the first ten chapters
  of <I>White Mule</I> and such famous short lyrics as &quot;Flowers by the
  Sea&quot; and &quot;The Red Lily&quot;; Stein, the first version of <I>Before
  the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship Faded;</I> Pound, Cantos XXX-XXXII
  as well as critical commentary; and Zukofsky, <I>&quot;A&quot;</I>1. In
  his capacity as informal poetry advisor, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#8" target="resource window">8</A>)</FONT>
  moreover, Zukofsky evidently persuaded Johns to publish poems by his &quot;Objectivist&quot;
  friends Carl Rakosi, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen, and Basil Bunting,
  by Kenneth Rexroth and Yvor Winters, Mary Butts and Mina Loy. But <I>Pagany</I>
  also published such early &quot;naturalist&quot; fiction as Edward Dahlberg's
  <I>Flushing to Calvary,</I> Erskine Caldwell's <I>American Earth </I>stories,
  and John Dos Passos's <I>Eveline </I>from <I>U.S.A. </I></P>
  <P>Johns takes the title of his journal from a work he greatly admired,
  Williams's autobiographical novel <I>Voyage to Pagany</I> (1928). But whereas
  Williams's Pagany is of course Europe, the &quot;pagan&quot; Old World
  where American innocents come to be initiated into the complexities of
  a sophisticated culture, Johns's Pagany, as the journal's subtitle, <I>&quot;A
  Native Quarterly</I>,&quot; makes clear, neatly reverses this Jamesian
  contrast between Old and New Worlds. In the Announcement on the opening
  page of the first issue (January-March1930), Johns explains: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Pagus is a broad term, meaning any sort of collection of peoples from
    the smallest district or village to the country as an inclusive whole.
    Taking America as the <I>pagus,</I> any one of us as the <I>paganus,</I>
    the inhabitant, and our conceptions, our agreements and disagreements,
    our ideas, ideals, whatever we have to articulate is <I>pagany</I>, our
    expression. </P>
    <P>This <I>Native Quarterly</I> is representative of a diverse and ungrouped
    body of spokesmen, bound geographically. Wary of definite alliance with
    any formulated standard <I>PAGANY </I>(as an enclosure) includes individual
    expression of native thought and emotion. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#9" target="resource window">9</A>)</FONT>
    </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Here, by an odd sleight-of-hand, <I>Pagany </I>(Europe) becomes the
  &quot;diverse and ungrouped body of spokesmen&quot; that is America. From
  the exotic and corrupt European Other to the cultural diversity of the
  United States: it is an emblem of the shift from the expatriate 1920s to
  the American 1930s, a shift that the journal will trace. Interestingly,
  when foreign writers (the English Mary Butts, the French Georges Hugnet)
  or artists (the French Eug&egrave;ne Atget) are included, their work is
  mediated by a specific American sponsor: Butts by Ezra Pound, Hugnet by
  Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thompson, Atget by Berenice Abbott. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#10" target="resource window">10</A>)</FONT>The first issue of <I>Pagany</I>, for example,
  contains Mary Butts's short story &quot;The House Party,&quot; which gives
  the Jamesian initiation-into-Europe motif a sardonic twist. The hero Paul
  is an American &quot;joy-boy,&quot; &quot;a cracked little specimen of
  a gigolo, after a year in prison for something he had not done,&quot; who
  is invited by a worldly Englishman named Vincent to a house party in a
  &quot;sea-washed, fly-blown, scorched hotel along the coast&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Under Vincent's wing, a man could stand up a bit. Vincent was English,
    tender, serious, older than he was. Vincent wanted him to come. Was no
    doubt cajoling, hypnotizing certain objections. Objections that were always
    made about him, especially by his own countrymen, the Americans who made
    a cult of Europe, a cult and a career, not quite perfect in their transplanting
    and conscious of it.&quot; </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Like the Zukofsky whom Williams criticized for &quot;forcing abstract
  conceptions into the sound pattern,&quot; Butts produces a prose notable
  for its calculated imprecision, its verbal and syntactic oddities. &quot;Under
  Vincent's wing, a man could stand up a bit&quot;: the sentence begins with
  a familiar clich&eacute;, only to deflate it with an absurd description:
  how does one stand up under someone's &quot;wing&quot;? Then, too, &quot;a
  man could stand up a bit&quot; alludes to Ford Madox Ford's 1926 <I>A Man
  Could Stand Up</I> (the third volume of the <I>Parade's End</I> tetralogy),
  a novel Butts surely knew. Is she saying that Paul's is, in its own way,
  a life in the trenches not wholly unlike that of Christopher Tietjens?
  It is hard to tell, Butts's mode being pastiche in Fredric Jameson's sense
  of &quot;blank parody,&quot; parody &quot;devoid . . . of any conviction
  that alongside the abnormal tongue you have momentarily borrowed, some
  healthy linguistic normality still exists.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#11" target="resource window">11</A>)</FONT> Vincent, we read further was &quot;no doubt cajoling,
  hypnotizing certain objections.&quot; Again the shift from a Victorian
  construction (&quot;no doubt cajoling&quot;), to the odd application of
  hypnosis to, not persons, but abstract nouns referring to mental states.
  In a similar vein, the energy of the European hosts is said to be &quot;virgin&quot;
  and Paul's &quot;adventures&quot; are characterized not by their kind but
  by their &quot;directions.&quot; The simile &quot;his adventures out-numbered
  theirs as the stars the dim electric light bulbs of the hotel&quot; calls
  attention to the willed extravagance of Butts's style, her refusal of structural
  coherence in favor of disjunction and dislocation. As she puts it in the
  opening of &quot;Brightness Falls,&quot; &quot;There is no head or tail
  to this story, except that it happened. On the other hand, how does one
  know that anything happened? How does one know?&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#12" target="resource window">12</A>)</FONT> Or take the opening of &quot;The Warning&quot;:
  &quot;This happened in the kind of house people live in who used not to
  live in that kind of house, who were taught to have very distinct opinions
  about the kind of people who lived in them. Yet, now that they have gone
  to live in them, they are rather different than when the other sort of
  person lived there&quot; (MB 117).</P>
  <P>The similarity to Stein should not be surprising; Butts knew Stein through
  her close friend Virgil Thomson and had frequented Stein's Paris salon.
  The first issue of <I>Pagany</I>, for that matter, contains Stein's &quot;Five
  Words in a Line&quot; (later incorporated into <I>Stanzas in Meditation,</I>1932),
  which begins:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Five words in a line.</P>
    <P>Bay and pay make a lake.</P>
    <P>Have to be held with what.</P>
    <P>They have to be held with what they have to be held.</P>
    <P>Dependent of dependent of why.</P>
    <P>With a little cry. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#13" target="resource window">13</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In his essay &quot;The Work of Gertrude Stein,&quot; which follows &quot;Five
  Words in a Line,&quot; Williams remarks, &quot;Having taken the words to
  her choice . . . [Stein] has completely unlinked them from their former
  relationships in the sentence. . . . The words, in writing, she discloses,
  transcend everything&quot; (PI, 1: 43-44).<I> </I>Most poets, Williams
  reminds the reader, take the easy way out: &quot;Starting from scratch
  we get, possibly, thatch; just as they have always done in poetry. Then
  they would try to connect it up by something like -- The mice scratch,
  beneath the thatch. Miss Stein does away with all that. The free-versists
  on the contrary used nothing else. They saved -- The mice, under the .
  . . , (PI, 1: 42).</P>
  <P>Reading Williams's essay, as one normally does, in <I>A Novelette and
  </I>Other Prose (1931) or, together with his &quot;A 1 Pound Stein&quot;
  (1934), in the <I>Selected Essays,</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#14" target="resource window">14</A>)</FONT>
  one assumes that Stein's was a case wholly exceptional, that no one else
  at the time was so thoroughly &quot;unlinking&quot; words from their normal
  syntactic relationships. But reading Williams's essay in the context of
  <I>Pagany</I> suggests that Stein's &quot;unlinkings,&quot; like the syntactic
  oddities, abstractions, and ungainly compoundings (e.g., &quot;orbit-trembling&quot;)
  of Zukofsky, which Williams had called into question, were not all that
  exceptional in the writing of the early 1930s. Indeed, Stein's free adaptation
  of Georges Hugnet's surrealist poetic suite <I>Enfances</I>, which appeared
  in the January-March1931 issue of <I>Pagany</I>, provides an interesting
  index to the new poetics.</P>
  <P></P>
  <P><B>Between the Cracks</B> </P>
  <P>Stein's thirty-eight page text, which prints Hugnet's French poem and
  Stein's English version on facing pages, has a complicated history that
  needn't preoccupy us here; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#15" target="resource window">15</A>) </FONT>suffice
  it to say that, according to the original plan, <I>Enfances,</I> together
  with Stein's &quot;reflection,&quot; as she called her version, was to
  be published in Paris by Editions Jeanne Bucher, with illustrations by
  Picasso, Louis Marcoussis, and Pavel Tchelitcheff. But when Hugnet objected
  that Stein's version could not considered a translation of his poem, she
  responded by giving the text printed in <I>Pagany</I> the title &quot;Poem
  Pritten on Pfances of Georges Hugnet.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#16" target="resource window">16</A>)</FONT>
  When she brought out the book version later that year, Stein eliminated
  the French text altogether and called her own poem <I>Before the Flowers
  of Friendship </I>Faded Friendship Faded. </P>
  <P>Stein's &quot;free translation&quot; of Hugnet's <I>Enfance </I>has
  been roundly criticized. Richard Bridgman says it &quot;suffers badly in
  the presence of the original which it purports to reflect. . . . Stein's
  liberties were so extreme that, did they not emanate from her, one might
  reasonably conclude that the translator knew too little French to do the
  job properly. . . . she carefully censored Hugnet's images of death, sex,
  nudity, and onanism. For a woman who offered lines of fearsomely coy sexual
  innuendo, Gertrude Stein remained, even in her middle fifties, prudish,
  or at least evasive.&quot; And even Marianne DeKoven, who celebrates Stein's
  experimental writing, remarks, &quot;Unfortunately, she seems to equate
  the essence of poetry with the way many poems sound, and instead of illuminating
  abstraction she achieves only travesty. . . . Much of the painfully unassimilated
  'poetic' diction in Stein's poem is the trace of the French original.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#17" target="resource window">17</A>)</FONT></P>
  <P>Note how similar this charge against Stein is to Williams's complaint
  about Zukofsky's &quot;stilted poetic&quot; language and his &quot;forcing
  of abstract conceptions into the sound pattern.&quot; It is a modernist-based
  critique of a new way of writing that came to be known by the curiously
  inappropriate label &quot;Objectivist.&quot; Consider #12 of Hugnet's <I>Enfances</I>:</P>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Hugnet's seventeen-line lyric celebrates, in rather melodramatic and
  strained terms, the secret pleasures of childhood masturbation. Its formal
  alexandrines, occasionally rhyming, give the poem a Baudelairean cast,
  even as its theme recalls the self-absorption of Hugnet's friend Jean Cocteau.
  Stein's &quot;reflection&quot; on Hugnet's &quot;love&quot; poem is wonderfully
  droll: <BR>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Contrary to Bridgman's supposition, Stein has obviously read her Hugnet
  carefully. Indeed, her witty pastiche of his masturbatory lyric takes all
  his references into account: extreme hunger and despair, the thirst for
  life punctuated by fear of death, the fidelity to one's ideals and refusal
  to betray them, the contrast between a virginal white and the red of penetration,
  the infantile regression to the nursing state. Then, too, Stein makes as
  much as Hugnet does of repetition and one-ups him at rhyming: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>&quot;They will be white with which they know they see, / that darker
    makes it be a color white for me,&quot; &quot;when I am dark indeed with
    red despair /who comes who has to care,&quot; and so on. But Stein goes
    much further: her own poem modulates a complex series of monosyllables
    containing long and short <I>i</I>'s (&quot;I like to lie I like to live
    I like to die I like to lie and live and die and live and die and by and
    by.&quot;), creating a singsong nursery-rhyme rhythm that expresses &quot;<I>enfance</I>&quot;
    via sound rather than imagery. In this playful network, every phoneme counts:
    &quot;lie&quot; becomes &quot;live&quot; with the addition of one consonant,
    and the &quot;it&quot; of line 2 (&quot;I need to leave it when I have
    it held&quot;) changes meaning with every new phrase. Finally, the hyperbole
    of &quot;thirsty with the thirst of hunger&quot; playfully acknowledges
    Hugnet's &quot;&agrave; l'exemple de ma faim,&quot; even as parts of speech
    are unlinked from their normal position (&quot;not alone to know that they
    plainly and ate or wishes&quot;). And the poem concludes on a commonsense
    note that truly does characterize infancy: &quot;Any little one will kill
    himself for milk.&quot;</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>One might object at this point that, whatever Stein's relation to Hugnet
  and his poetic sequence, her version of #12 should be understood as a characteristic
  Stein work, one text among many similar ones like <I>Tender Buttons</I>
  or <I>A Long Gay Boo</I>k<I>,</I> both written almost two decades earlier.
  But however familiar the repetition, the reduced vocabulary, and skewed
  grammar, the Stein of the 1910s and early 1920s was not as given to parody
  and allusive literary play as is the author of &quot;Poem Pritten on Pfances
  of Georges Hugnet.&quot; The early portraits like &quot;Picasso&quot; and
  &quot;Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia&quot; manifest a care for consistency
  that we don't find here or in the great poem of this period, &quot;Stanzas
  in Meditation.&quot; Abstraction, intertextuality, the dispersal of the
  subject, obsessive rhyming and related sound patterning -- these become
  Stein's signature. Blood, in her scheme of things, is associated, not with
  Hugnet's wound of love but with what are obliquely presented as her preferred
  domestic activities. Sewing (&quot;the difference is that sewing makes
  it bleed&quot;) modulates slyly via the rhyme &quot;bleed&quot; / &quot;seed&quot;
  into the onanism Bridgman takes Stein to have ignored. &quot;All the way
  to seed and seeding and repine and they will which is mine and not at all
  mine&quot;: these words constitute Stein's covert tribute to Alice Toklas
  and her witty exposure of Georges Hugnet's vaunted self-absorption. &quot;Know
  it for ripeness,&quot; as she archly puts it, &quot;without deserting all
  of it.&quot;</P>
  <P>From the vantage point of high modernism, such writing was bound to
  appear deficient: no &quot;direct treatment of the thing,&quot; no objective
  correlative, no clear visual images. Stein's &quot;deliberate gracelessness&quot;
  --the phrase is Peter Quartermain's with reference to Mina Loy <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#18" target="resource window">18</A>)</FONT> -- may also be linked to the new transgression
  of conventional gender roles, a transgression that goes hand in hand with
  the social uncertainties of the early Depression years. The July-September
  1931 issue of <I>Pagany</I>, for example, contains Loy's &quot;Lady Laura
  in Bohemia,&quot; which begins:</P>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>&quot;Lady Laura in Bohemia&quot; is perhaps best understood as a late
  modernist sendup of Eliot's &quot;Portrait of a Lady,&quot; of Pound's
  &quot;Portrait d'une Femme,&quot; and section12 of <I>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley
  </I>(&quot;The Lady Valentine&quot;). The swans of Loy's poem are no longer
  Yeats's &quot;brilliant creatures,&quot; drifting mysteriously on Coole
  lake but a &quot;circus&quot; of debutantes, &quot;trained&quot; to behave
  according to the norms of their &quot;genealogical tree.&quot; &quot;Trained,&quot;
  the opening word in the poem, places emphasis on social and cultural control,
  an emphasis underscored by the poem's rhythm, which is much closer to the
  &quot;sequence of metronome&quot; than to that of the &quot;musical phrase&quot;
  Pound advocated so strenuously. Take the lines: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>she</P>
    <P>proceeds recedingly</P>
    <P></P>
    <P>Her eliminate flesh of fashion</P>
    <P>inseparable from the genealogical tree</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Here the rhymes &quot;she&quot; / &quot;recedingly&quot; / &quot;tree&quot;
  are intentionally silly, forcing the reader to stress the last syllable
  of &quot;recedingly&quot; and run &quot;genealogical&quot; and &quot;tree&quot;
  together. More important, Loy's structures of modification are characterized
  by repeated grammatical oddities: Laura &quot;proceeds recedingly,&quot;
  her &quot;flesh&quot; is &quot;eliminate&quot; (rather than &quot;eliminated&quot;)
  and it &quot;columns&quot; a &quot;towering reticence / of lifted chin.&quot;
  In line 12, the abstract noun &quot;regret&quot; is described as &quot;inebriate&quot;
  or drunk. In line 13, &quot;caste,&quot; Lady Laura's &quot;caste&quot;
  is defined as &quot;vertical,&quot; and the quotation in line 14 is not
  attributed to anyone in particular. It could be Lady Laura's exclamation,
  but then again it could be that of a bystander in the &quot;Bohemian&quot;
  night club or even the words of the poet herself.<BR>
  </P>
  <P>Once one accustoms oneself to the curious coupling of abstract and concrete
  words in Loy's poetry, her language begins to resonate. The opening describes
  the entrance of a well-brought up and aristocratic young woman (&quot;Trained
  in a circus of swans&quot;) into a Montparnasse bar (a later couplet reads
  &quot;her hell is / Zelli's,&quot; p. 126) -- an entrance made &quot;recedingly,&quot;
  with mock unobtrusiveness and tiny, graceful steps. In keeping with the
  fashion and her &quot;genealogical tree,&quot; her flesh is &quot;eliminate&quot;--she
  is properly sleek and slim. But she carries herself so upright that her
  &quot;lifted chin&quot; and demure demeanor give her an air of &quot;towering
  reticence&quot; as she &quot;columns&quot; her way into the room. Drunk
  though she may be, her hiccoughs are beautifully disguised as little bows:
  she might be curtseying to the queen. Her &quot;descent / into the half-baked
  underworld&quot; of Bohemia is not so much a fall as a &quot;somersault,&quot;
  which is to say that women of Laura's &quot;vertical caste&quot; always
  bounce back, no matter how great their &quot;inebriate regret.&quot; Her
  behavior, in other words, is dictated by birth and caste, in sharp contrast
  to those whose &quot;cradle&quot; has been the &quot;curb.&quot;</P>
  <P>What Loy has produced, then, is a sardonic cartoon of caf&eacute; society,
  the poetic equivalent of a George Grosz cabaret scene. Yet it is composed
  of the most minimal strokes; no visual picture of the characters or the
  setting ever fully emerges. People are defined by synecdoches: Laura <I>is
  </I>the eliminate flesh of fashion, the column of towering reticence, and
  so on. And when metaphor is used, it is invariably sardonic, as in the
  final line of the poem, &quot;She is yet like a diamond on a heap of broken
  glass&quot; (p. 126). There is nothing diamond-like about this &quot;memorable
  divorc&eacute;e,&quot; who was &quot;christened by the archbishop of Canterbury.&quot;
  Only in a &quot;heap of broken glass&quot; can she sparkle momentarily.
  And even this reference has a double-entendre, Loy no doubt alluding playfully
  to the &quot;heap of broken images&quot; in <I>The Waste Land</I>. Eliot
  parodies, for that matter, were common in this period: in the same volume
  of <I>Pagany</I>, Mary Butts has a poem called &quot;Thinking of Saints
  and of Petronius Arbiter&quot; (the title comes directly from Yeats's elegy
  for Mabel Beardsley, &quot;Upon a Dying Lady&quot;) that contains this
  parody of &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Logopoeia: brittle, hard-edged, tough-minded, slightly nasty. For both
  Loy and Butts, extravagant verbal play is more important than the Poundian
  demand for accuracy and precision. But what is especially odd is that even
  the so-called realistic fiction, most of it by men, found in the pages
  of <I>Pagany</I> -- a fiction I now turn to -- displays a taste for the
  grotesquerie and self-parody we find in the work of Stein, Loy, and Butts.</P>
  <P><B><BR>
  From Imagism to Super-Realism</B></P>
  <P>The January-March1931 issue of <I>Pagany</I>, for example, opens with
  a short story, more properly a prose poem, bearing the portentous title
  &quot;Hours Before Eternity.&quot; It has fifty-three short sections, each
  assigned a roman numeral. Here are the first two:</P>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER>I</P>
    <P>In the chill frost of winter I left Memphis and rode on the outside
    of freight cars all the way to the Atlantic. The nights were so cold that
    my fingers froze around the iron bars and at daybreak each morning I had
    to bite them away with my teeth. The joints of my fingers broke sometimes
    when I bit them from the iron and the flesh cracked to the bone like the
    deep cut of a sharp knife. When I got to Charleston I worked all night
    in a dairy and drank the warm foam of the new white milk and all day I
    sat in my room at the boarding house and waited for the coming of the first
    blossoms of the magnolia trees.</P>
    <P></P>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER>II</P>
    <P>Men who worked with their hands and backs were proud of their male strength
    when they ran shouting in naked strides to their women but those with soft
    damp fingers were so ashamed of themselves that they whispered in halting
    negatives and tried to cover their vulgarity with towels. (P2, 1: 1) </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Realistic autobiographical narrative in the vein of Sherwood Anderson
  or Ring Lardner? A naturalistic picture of the seamy side of life in the
  poverty-stricken rural South? It begins that way, with the references to
  Memphis and Charleston, the hopping of freight trains and fingers frozen
  to the iron window bars. But the second section, with its distinction between
  the &quot;Men who worked with their hands and backs,&quot; (note the erotic
  double entendre in the apparently blunt statement) and &quot;those with
  soft damp fingers&quot; seems oddly gratuitous in the context. The strong
  and the weak? The studs and the pansies? What, one wonders, does this seemingly
  homophobic dismissal have to do with the narrator's quest, which leads
  him to pursue &quot;the quick beauty of of a girl's face&quot; seen in
  a crowd and stunning enough to be blinding. &quot;As soon as I could see
  again I looked and saw a scar on my eyes. The scar was an etching of the
  beauty I had seen and when tears had tried but could not wash its lines
  away I saw it framed in colors like the rainbow&quot;? (II, 1: 2). </P>
  <P>The image of the scar across the eyes has a surrealistic cast (one thinks
  of Max Ernst's 1929 <I>La femme 100 t&ecirc;tes)</I> at odds with the hard-boiled
  narrative of passages like &quot;I walked into the country again and worked
  among negroes on a farm. The white man made us sweat from sun-up till dark
  and he would not let us stop for a drink of water&quot; (XII). A similar
  equivocation between surrealism and naturalism occurs later:</P>
  <P></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER>XV </P>
    <P>The negro girl that he told me to bring him would not come to his house
    and I went back and told him so. He told me to harness a mule and follow
    him. We went down to the cabin where the girl was and he brought her outside
    and dropped her in the yard. While he put a trace chain around her waist
    I backed the mule and hooked the chain to the single-tree. When we were
    ready to go he kicked the mule in the belly and broke off a hunk of chewing
    tobacco. The negro girl was dragged behind the mule to the house and when
    we got there I helped him take her inside. He forged the chain around her
    and spiked it to the floor. When I went to sleep I could hear the rattling
    of the chain and when I woke up it was rattling again. The girl cried all
    the time but he would not let her go home.</P>
    <P></P>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER>XVI</P>
    <P>Once that winter one of the negroes said he was too sick to work so
    we killed him with a shotgun and buried him in the manure pile.</P>
    <P></P>
    <P ALIGN=CENTER>XVII</P>
    <P>The man brought another negro girl to the house but she had greased
    her body with lard and when he took off her clothes he could not hold her.

  <P>Such writing has usually been classified as the &quot;literature of
  social protest,&quot; with the horrific narrative providing, in flat, objective
  manner, a graphic image of white oppression and black victimization. Short
  declarative sentences, reductive vocabulary, lack of involvement of the
  speaking subject: these are what one might expect from the author of &quot;Hours
  Before Eternity&quot; who happens to be Erskine Caldwell, the best-selling
  Southern &quot;naturalist&quot; author of <I>Tobacco Road </I>(1932) and
  <I>God's Little Acre</I> (1933), the young Communist who went on to visit
  Russia with his then-wife Margaret Bourke-White and wrote the text for
  her book of documentary photographs <I>You have Seen Their Faces</I> (1937),
  later becoming increasingly conservative, a &quot;sell-out&quot; to Hollywood,
  relegated today to the company of forgotten white male writers of the period.
  Even James E. Devlin, who wrote the 1984 Twayne book on Caldwell, concludes:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>He is without any question a minor writer, and further, a limited one.
    Philosophically he is of few ideas and those often inconsistent. He has
    never decided whether it is the heart or the head to which he owes the
    greater allegiance. His belief in feeling, intuition, and emotion as God-directed
    often falters when opposed by the strong pressure of a naturalistic determinism
    that also guides his thought. About sexual passion he is simultaneously
    knowedgeable and as innocent as Steve Henderson, the wooden sixteen-year-old
    of <I>Summertime Island</I> (1968). <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#20" target="resource window">20</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>What, then, is this &quot;minor&quot; &quot;naturalist&quot; writer
  doing in <I>Pagany, </I>alongside Pound, Williams, Butts, Stein, Loy, and
  Zukofsky, alongside the photographs of Eug&egrave;ne Atget and Berenice
  Abbott, the Charles Demuth illustrations for Henry James's <I>Turn of the
  Screw</I>? Is it just one of those mistaken links that hindsight can correct?
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#21" target="resource window">21</A>) </FONT>Or can we read the much castigated
  stylistic inconsistecies somewhat differently?</P>
  <P>In a 1935 essay for <I>The New Republic</I>, reprinted in <I>The Philosophy
  of Literary Form</I>, Kenneth Burke singles out for comment Caldwell's
  &quot;Hours Before Eternity,&quot; and the two related stories that comprise
  &quot;The Sacrilege of Alan Kent,&quot; published in the collection <I>American
  Earth</I>. (1931).</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>They contain a kind of aphoristic rhetoric, except that the aphorisms
    are less ideas than tiny plots. . . . The swift segments shunt us back
    and forth between brutality and wistfulness. Perhaps the grandiose, the
    violent, and the gentle qualities of the piece are all fused in this bit
    of purest poetry: &quot;Once the sun was so hot a bird came down and walked
    beside me in my shadow.&quot; A section in <I>Pagany</I> containing this
    item was the first thing by Caldwell I ever saw. For days I was noisy in
    my enthusiasm--but I could not understand how it went with some of his
    other work. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#22" target="resource window">22</A>)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In trying to understand his own reaction, Burke suggests that Caldwell's
  &quot;cult of incongruity&quot; (KB 352) results from a &quot;balked religiosity,&quot;
  channelled into &quot;political exhortation,&quot; the resulting perspective
  being not so much complex in the modernist sense, as wilfully contradictory.
  His &quot;particular aptitude has been in scrambling or garbling properties,&quot;
  a &quot;deft way of putting the wrong things together&quot; (KB 351-52).
  For Devlin, such inconsistency is ipso facto a fault, but for Burke, proto-postmodernist
  that he is, irresolution has a positive side. What he likes about &quot;Hours
  Before Eternity,&quot; is that the text &quot;muddl[es] our judgments instead
  of stabilizing them&quot; (KB 353). Such withholding on the author's part,
  he posits, &quot;is the subtlest feature of Caldwell's method. Where the
  author leaves out so much, the reader begins making up the difference for
  himself. Precisely by omitting humaneness where humaneness is most called
  for, he may stimulate the reader to supply it&quot; (KB, 355). And he concludes,
  &quot;I have denied that Caldwell is a realist. In his tomfoolery he comes
  closer to the Dadaists; when his grotesqueness is serious, he is a Superrealist,&quot;
  a poet of &quot;<I>nonrational</I> linkages&quot; and &quot;fantastic simplifications&quot;
  (KB, 356-57).</P>
  <P>&quot;Fantastic simplification&quot; is a good term, not only for Caldwell's
  fiction but also for much of the work published in <I>Pagany</I> and in
  such related journals as <I>Blues</I> and <I>Contact.</I> &quot;Dada&quot;
  and &quot;Superrealist&quot; (surrealist) may not be quite the defining
  terms for &quot;Hours Before Eternity,&quot; for the dadaists would never
  have produced sentences so sober and realistic as &quot;He handed me a
  cup of flour and a piece of fat meat and a few potatoes and gave me permission
  to use his cooking stove&quot; (PII, 1: 3), and the surrealists were much
  more programmatic and Freudian. Rather, Caldwell's &quot;deft way of putting
  the wrong things together&quot; depends upon a curious undercutting of
  the authority of the subject. The tone is so uncertain, shifting as it
  does from caricature to pathos, from a racy humor to a grim earnestness,
  that, in Burke's words, &quot;it muddl[es] our judgments rather than stabilizing
  them.&quot; In a paragraph like section XV above, for example, the curious
  and confusing use of personal pronouns (thirty-one in nine sentences) distances
  the reader from the terrible events, &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her&quot;
  becoming, in one sense, so many counters on a chessboard. </P>
  <P>Such distancing &quot;superrealism&quot; would seem to be a homegrown
  product, quite appropriate for the pages of a &quot;Native Quarterly.&quot;
  Indeed, the &quot;non-rational linkages&quot; and &quot;fantastic abstractions&quot;
  Burke speaks of, the predilection for parody, play, contradiction, and
  the undercutting of mimesis despite referential overload, can be seen as
  a kind of signature of literary discourse in Depression America. Take Edward
  Dahlberg's autobiographical narrative &quot;Graphophone Nickelodeon Days,&quot;
  which immediately follows Gertrude Stein's &quot;Poem Pritten on Pfances&quot;
  in the January-March1931 issue of <I>Pagany.</I> </P>
  <P>Like Erskine Caldwell, Edward Dahlberg is now a largely forgotten writer;
  his name is not even listed in the 1988 <I>Columbia Literary History </I>of
  the United States. If he is remembered at all, it is largely for the role
  he played as mentor to the young Charles Olson. <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#23" target="resource window">23</A>) </FONT>But again like Caldwell, when read against texts by
  Stein and Williams in the pages of <I>Pagany,</I> Dahlberg emerges as by
  no means just another documentary realist with socialist convictions. &quot;And
  yet it all came back, the taste of it, the tang and brine of it, like the
  windy crispy newspaper afternoon air over the san francisco wharves,&quot;
  the <I>Pagany</I> story begins, conventionally enough, its focus on the
  recording, remembering &quot;I,&quot; detached from the &quot;tastes&quot;
  and &quot;tang&quot; of his childhood. But detachment gives way to penny-arcade
  jingles, whose rhythms recall Stein's <I>Before the Flowers of Friendship
  Faded</I>: </P>

  &quot;a wiry and rusty rat trap,&quot; and &quot;red caboose bonfires&quot;
  alternate with documentary reference (&quot;armour &amp; swift packing
  house&quot;) and surreal phrasing (&quot;the midnight ride of a can of
  beer&quot;). The text never quite makes up its mind where it wants to go,
  but this may be precisely its appeal, the very language calling into question
  the forward linear movement we expect of narrative. </P>
  <P>Is the publication in <I>Pagany</I> of Dahlberg's prose an anomaly?
  I think that on the contrary this text, like Caldwell's &quot;Hours before
  Eternity,&quot; provides a matrix for Zukofsky's early &quot;Objectivist&quot;
  poetry that may well be more telling than the usual placement of that poetry
  in the Pound-Williams tradition. Take, for example, Zukofsky's &quot;Four
  Poems&quot; (&quot;Buoy,&quot; &quot;Awake,&quot; &quot;Blue light is the
  night harbor-slip,&quot; and &quot;Passing tall&quot;), published alongside
  Dahlberg's &quot;Graphophone Nickelodeon Days,&quot; Stein's &quot;Poem
  Pritten on Pfances,&quot; and Butts's &quot;Thinking of Saints.&quot; With
  the exception of &quot;Awake,&quot; these poems, written between 1925 and
  1931, were included in &quot;29 Poems.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#24" target="resource window">24</A>)

  <P>Williams was surely right in telling Zukofsky that his early poems had
  not early poems have not been &quot;objectivized in new or fresh observations.&quot;
  Zukofsky's break with what Burton Hatlen has called a &quot;late Imagist&quot;
  &quot;poetics of presence,&quot; a poetics in which &quot;words remain
  absolutely faithful to 'things' in their sensory immediacy,&quot; is incontrovertible,
  but I am not sure it follows that &quot;if the seeable is by definition
  unsayable, then language, rather than giving us Being in its fullness,
  must reconcile itself to the more difficult task of enacting our endless
  and endlessly frustrated struggle <I>toward</I> Being.&quot; <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#25" target="resource window">25</A>)</FONT> For like the Stein of &quot;Poems Pritten on
  Pfances&quot; or the Loy of &quot;Lady Laura of Bohemia,&quot; the Zukofsky
  of &quot;Buoy&quot; foregrounds the play of the signifier, especially paragram
  and pun. &quot;Buoy -- no, how&quot;: the first line puns on &quot;Boy
  -- know how,&quot; &quot;know how&quot; being the great trait in thirties
  technological America. &quot;Boy, what know how!&quot;: like George Oppen's
  frigidaire poem (&quot;Thus / Hides the /Parts. . .&quot;), published in
  the &quot;Objectivist&quot; number of <I>Poetry</I> (January 1931), Zukofsky
  is examining a world in which coherent natural images -- a buoy at sea
  as a <I>point de rep&egrave;re</I> for incoming freighters -- have been
  replaced by floating signifiers. &quot;It is not a question&quot; (line
  2) of asking what &quot;this freighter [is] carrying,&quot; or even where
  the smoke is coming from or who blew the whistle. Since &quot;commerce
  will not complete / Anything,&quot; there are no meaningful images, only
  a &quot;complete fragment&quot; --but &quot;Of&quot; what? Evidently &quot;Of--/
  Nothing.&quot; </P>
  <P>The second stanza urges us to &quot;look&quot; at &quot;that gull /
  Streak the water!&quot; But this is not the world of Hart Crane's &quot;Bridge,&quot;
  composed in these same years, where the &quot;seagull's wings shall dip
  and pivot him, / Over the chained bay water Liberty.&quot; No &quot;apparitional&quot;
  white gulls as emblems of transcendence. &quot;Getting nearer are we,&quot;
  asks the poet. &quot;Hear?&quot; (again with a pun on &quot;here&quot;).
  And then, in what is a statement of poetics, we read, &quot;count the dissonances.&quot;
  And dissonances are what we live with. The following question &quot;Shoal?&quot;suggests
  that there is no coherent picture to be composed of this harbor scene,
  no line of demarcation between shore or shoal and water can be shown. Images
  &quot;accost&quot; us, but &quot;accost&quot; contains within it the word
  &quot;cost,&quot; and this in turn suggests the &quot;Cost accounting&quot;
  of the final line. &quot;Commerce&quot; is what it's really all about;
  money is the &quot;buoy or marker around which the &quot;busy&quot; harbor
  traffic revolves. But -- and I think this is important--the poem is not
  at all polemical about this state of affairs; its focus is on the ironic
  potential of words to &quot;mean&quot; differently when they are &quot;unlinked&quot;
  from their usual contexts. No pretty harbor scene with freighters in the
  distance sailing between the buoys. &quot;Count--cost-accost-account&quot;:
  the cost of accounting, the accosting (accounting) of costs: the play is
  Steinian in its wit.</P>
  <P>Then, too, the lineation of &quot;Buoy&quot; obliquely pokes fun at
  the imagist free-verse lyric. Much has been made of Zukofsky's musical
  virtuosity, <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#26" target="resource window">26</A>) </FONT>but it is useful
  to remember that his soundscapes exist at the micro-- rather than the macro
  level of lyric form, a poem like &quot;Buoy&quot; modulating long <I>o</I>'s
  (&quot;no,&quot; &quot;smoke,&quot; &quot;blow&quot;) and <I>iy </I>diphthongs
  (&quot;Streak,&quot; &quot;nearer,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;hear&quot;)
  with great ingenuity, even as its individual lines are purposely flat-footed.
  &quot;Buoy--no, how&quot;: three stresses on monosyllables, separated by
  punctuation: hardly an attractive line. The next two are similar: </P>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>To call these lines &quot;prosaic&quot; would still not convey the oppositional,
  anti-poetic stance of the young Zukofsky, his aggressive challenge to the
  reader to &quot;count the dissonances.&quot; Surely &quot;Objectivist,&quot;
  with its connotations of materiality, is a curious label for a lyric so
  uncompromising and so self-destructive.</P>
  <P><B><BR>
  AMERICA FIRST AND LAST</B></P>
  <P>I have been arguing that the poetics of the early 1930s produced an
  adversarial literature that called into question the pieties of an earlier,
  more innocent modernism by means of powerful wit, complex parody, contradiction
  of formal and emotional registers, and especially the dissolution of the
  coherent &quot;lyric voice&quot; as controlling presence in the poetic
  text. The sentimental slides into the cynical and back again. Reference,
  moreover, does not insure mimetic representation. Nothing is taken for
  granted; nothing is quite what it seems to be. </P>
  <P>This can be seen even in the photographs of the period. In the January-March1931
  issue of <I>Pagany</I>, we find, side by side with Dahlberg's fiction and
  Zukofsky's poetry, four reproductions of Eug&egrave;ne Atget photographs,
  evidently transmitted to the editor by Berenice Abbott, of whom more in
  a moment. Atget's astonishing images of shop windows, arcades, doorways,
  and street corners, most of them curiously empty of people, are at once
  documentary and surrealistic, their lighting and angle shots endowing the
  most ordinary scenes -- a dressmaker's dummy in a shop window, a display
  of stuffed animals, a puppet-theatre curtain, or monkey house in the park
  -- with a dreamlike presence, rather as Zukofsky's &quot;buoy&quot; or
  Williams's &quot;back wings of the hospital&quot; become part of a language
  game. Furthermore, the fabled breakdown of the divide between &quot;high&quot;
  and &quot;low&quot; art attributed to postmodernism is taken for granted
  in these prints, where the mundane is inseparable from the emphasis on
  formal composition. </P>
  <P>Thousands of the negatives Atget had made prior to his death in 1927,
  at a time when his work was virtually unknown, were rescued and printed
  by Berenice Abbott, four of whose own photographs appear in the next issue
  of <I>Pagany</I>. Having returned to America as part of the expatriate
  exodus from Paris in 1929, Abbott wanted to do for New York what Atget
  had done for Paris. In particular, she wanted to provide a documentary
  record of urban transformation: the demolition of old buildings to make
  way for the new skyscrapers, the surviving neighborhood shops, the relation
  of technology to nature, stone and steel to sky. Like Atget's, her images
  are only superficially instances of documentary realism, their strange
  placement and surprising juxtapositions of materials creating a landscape
  as surreal as Caldwell's mysterious Southern sites.</P>
  <P>The 1931 volume, which featured these photographs as well as Charles
  Demuth's similarly stylized watercolor illustrations for Henry James's
  <I>The Turn of the Screw</I>, side-by-side with the poetry of Williams
  and the fiction of Dahlberg and Dos Passos, was thus a triumph for <I>Pagany</I>.
  But the following year, things began to unravel. True, Richard Johns was
  still discovering new (or new for him) authors: the January-March1932 issue
  had a long poem (&quot;Brown River, Smile&quot;) by Jean Toomer, whose
  <I>Cane</I> Johns had long admired, as well as a first appearance (&quot;Electra-Orestes&quot;)
  by H. D. But the journal's financial situation had become precarious. <FONT
   SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#27" target="resource window">27</A>) </FONT>Often, Johns couldn't afford to
  pay his authors, much less the print shop, and the quality of production
  went down. To make things worse, a number of accidents (including a fire)
  caused manuscripts to be destroyed. The October-December 1932 issue was
  thus delayed and didn't come out until February 1933. And this was <I>Pagany</I>'s
  final issue.</P>
  <P>The usual explanation for such endings is that the modernist avant-garde
  could not survive the Depression, that it gave way to a more socially conscious,
  more politicized &quot;writing on the Left,&quot; as it came to be called.
  In his moving Introduction to Stephen Halpert's <I>Return to PAGANY</I>
  (1969), for example, Kenneth Rexroth, whose own poetry was featured in
  the pages of Zukofsky's<I>&quot;Objectivists&quot; Anthology </I>and Charles
  Henri Ford's <I>Blues,</I> as well as in the first issue of <I>Pagany,</I>
  put it this way: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><I>Pagany</I>'s lifetime spanned the breakdown of the international
    avant garde as the world economic crisis shut down and a quite different
    kind of literature emerged. . . . Under the pressure of catastrophe, writers
    and artists all over the world began to turn to attack the specific social
    evils from which they had thought they had escaped by concentrating on
    the underlying, fundamental Lie. Richard Johns was especially sensitive
    to this great turn, and published some of the earliest and finest writing
    of the kind that was eventually to be debauched and destroyed by the slogans
    of falsification--Proletcult and Socialist Realism. (ARP xiii, xv).</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>But this is not quite the way it happened. For one thing, the poetry
  of the Objectivists, as of Mina Loy and Mary Butts, and of the Gertrude
  Stein and William Carlos Williams of the 1930s, was already quite different
  in mood and rhetoric from the more utopian work of the early modernists.
  Picasso's <I>Ma Jolie</I> (1913), for example, was, for all its cubist
  fragmentation and complexity, still a highly painterly work, a portrait,
  after all, of a lady, whereas it isn't clear that Abbott's &quot;documentary&quot;
  studies of barbershop storefronts, sandwiched between newer steel and concrete
  structures, are &quot;art&quot; at all. A similar contrast can be found
  between <I>Ulysses</I> and Dos Passos's <I>U.S.A.</I>,<I> </I>whose &quot;Eveline&quot;
  sequence appeared in the summer and autumn 1931 issues of <I>Pagany</I>.
  <BR>
  </P>
  <P>Secondly, the umbrella term &quot;social protest literature&quot; obscures
  some important distinctions. Like Rexroth himself, the Objectivist poets
  were certainly &quot;writers on the Left&quot; (George Oppen is perhaps
  the most striking example of the poet who, as onetime Communist party member,
  had to go underground during the McCarthy years), but the Left was itself
  curiously divided when it came to questions of aesthetic. Consider the
  July-September 1932 issue of <I>Pagany</I>, which features the &quot;First
  Movement&quot; (to become book I) of Zukofsky's monumental poem <I>&quot;A&quot;</I>.
  The well-known opening, which provides us with the title of the poem, its
  first word, and the note musicians tune by, all the while using the separation
  of the indefinite article (&quot;A&quot;) from the noun (&quot;round&quot;)
  it modifies to create a pun on the preposition &quot;around,&quot; immediately
  calls into question the authority of the lyric speaker: <BR>
  </P>

	A
   	   Round of fiddles playing Bach --
	    The double chorus.
		  &quot;Come ye daughters, share my anguish --&quot;
	     Bare arms, black dresses
		 &quot;See Him!  Whom?--&quot;
	      Bediamond the passion of our Lord
		 &quot;See Him!  How?--&quot;	 		 (PIII, 3: 9)  </PRE>
  <P><BR>
  </P>
  <P>The scene (we learn further along) is Carnegie Hall, the occasion an
  Easter Sunday performance of Bach's <I>St. Matthew's Passion</I>, with<I>
  </I>phrases from the oratorio punctuating the narrator's account. And even
  these phrases, become the subject of the poet's play, with &quot;<I>See
  Him! Whom?</I>, <I>&quot;See Him! </I>How?&quot;<I> </I>referring to the
  audience's alienation from the Christian ethos of the <I>Passion</I>. &quot;First
  Movement&quot; now submits these motifs to a complex &quot;musical&quot;
  development, that partly echoes, partly ironizes Bach's own music, and
  it ends with bits of conversation overheard on the street after the concert:

    13)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This voice (evidently of a wealthy industrialist) is punctuated by the
  words of the <I>Passion (&quot;Ye lightnings, ye thunders / In clouds are
  ye vanished?</I>&quot;),<I> </I>which in their turn modulate into a concluding
  line --&quot;Open, O fierce flaming pit!&quot; -- that refers, not only
  to the oratorio from which it comes, but also to the poet's own sense of
  hell inherent in the contrast between the musical discourse of Bach and
  the discourse of the city in which his <I>Passion</I> is heard, or rather
  goes unheard.</P>
  <P>It is instructive to compare <I>&quot;A&quot;</I> to a poem which appears
  later in the same issue of <I>Pagany</I>: </P>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P></P>
  <P>Coming upon this after reading Butts and Loy, Stein and Zukofsky, the
  reader may well be confused. Is this a late poem by Arthur Symons? Ernest
  Dowson? John Davidson? The voice that speaks in neatly rhyming <I>abba</I>
  quatrains is in total control, able to speak for a larger &quot;we,&quot;
  a &quot;we&quot; who are somehow (how?) &quot;unborn&quot; and &quot;unknowing,&quot;
  waiting for the miracle at Delphi to occur. Predictably the lanes are &quot;muted,&quot;
  their shadows &quot;aflame,&quot; their &quot;terror muffled.&quot; Everything
  is vague, shadowy, disembodied, melancholy. But why and how?</P>
  <P>The author of this poem, Edwin Rolfe, was a Communist activist poet
  as well as a iction writer-journalist, who appeared frequently in <I>New
  Masses</I> and <I>The Daily Worker</I>, and was to serve, in 1937, in the
  Abraham Lincoln Brigade and write a volume of poems about the Spanish Civil
  War. &quot;Rolfe,&quot; writes Cary Nelson, &quot;is one of the politically
  committed poets whose work largely meets New Critical standards for producing
  formally coherent, metaphorically inventive, fully realized, and self-sufficient
  poems. That he is almost wholly excluded from our cultural memory demonstrates
  that political--not merely purportedly disinterested aesthetic--criteria
  have helped determine what poets we honor in our texts and literary histories.&quot;
  <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#28" target="resource window">28</A>) </FONT></P>
  <P>But it is not clear what Nelson means by terms like &quot;formally coherent,&quot;
  &quot;self-sufficient,&quot; or &quot;aesthetic.&quot; In point of fact,
  Rolfe's latter-day Yellow Nineties mode <FONT SIZE=-1>(<a href="barbed_footnotes.html#29" target="resource window">29</A>)
  </FONT>would certainly <I>not</I> meet &quot;New Critical standards,&quot;
  and not because of the poet's political stance; rather, a critic like Cleanth
  Brooks or Allen Tate would have complained of the laxity of the poem's
  diction and the self-indulgence of its tone. Indeed, it is time we stopped
  pitting the ostensible &quot;radicalism&quot; of poets like Rolfe against
  &quot;New Critical&quot; &quot;conservatism&quot; and compare it instead
  to the very different Left radicalism of the Objectivists, whose work was
  at least as neglected by, say, Brooks and Warren as was Rolfe's.</P>
  <P>The case of James T. Farrell, whose first appearance in <I>Pagany</I>
  was in the same issue, is similar. Here is the opening of &quot;Twenty-Five
  Bucks&quot;:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Fifteen years is a hell of a long time to live in grease. Fifteen years
    is a hell of a long time to keep getting your jaw socked. Fifteen years
    is a hell of a long time for a broken-down, never-was of a palooka named
    Kid Tucker. Fifteen years stretched back through a reeking line of stale
    fight clubs, of jeers and clammy dressing rooms, and lousy gyms, and cheap
    can houses where every bed sheet is filthy with the countless foot marks
    of nameless customers, of ratty saloons with sawdust floors. . . . (P3,
    no. 3: 97)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;Use no word,&quot; Pound had cautioned in a statement Zukofsky,
  for one, took very seriously, &quot;that does not contribute to the presentation.&quot;
  But in Farrell's tale of the prize-fighter's demise -- the opening paragraph
  above is a kind of recycling of Eliot's &quot;sawdust restaurants with
  oyster shells,&quot; but without Eliot's irony. Farrell's words, especially
  his adjectives, are nothing if not predictable: fight-clubs are &quot;stale,&quot;
  dressing-rooms &quot;clammy,&quot; gyms &quot;lousy,&quot; saloons &quot;ratty,&quot;
  and bed-sheets &quot;filthy.&quot; And the passage's heavy repetition (the
  anaphora of &quot;Fifteen years. . .&quot;) does not exactly make for a
  dynamic rhythm.<BR>
  </P>
  <P>Oddly enough, then, this vein of &quot;proletarian&quot; writing bypassed
  modernism, returning to the genteel tradition of a previous generation.
  The split between the aesthetic and the political, a split that had threatened
  the life of the avant-garde from the time of its inception in the later
  nineteenth century, had now widened to a large fissure. The &quot;radical
  political&quot; wing associated with Edwin Rolfe and James Farrell was
  quickly co-opted by the Establishment. In the winter of 1934, exactly one
  year after the last issue of <I>Pagany</I> was published, the <I>Partisan
  Review </I>put out its first issue. Subtitled &quot;A Bi-Monthly of Revolutionary
  Literature,&quot; <I>Partisan Review</I> was the official organ of the
  John Reed Club of New York (a cell of the American Communist Party) until
  1937 when, in response to the Moscow Show Trials, the magazine severed
  its Party connections. The editorial in the first issue states: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>We propose to concentrate on creative and critical literature, but we
    shall maintain a definite viewpoint -- that of the revolutionary working
    class. Through our specific literary medium we shall participate in the
    struggle of the workers and sincere intellectuals against imperialist war,
    fascism, national and racial oppresison, and for the abolition of the system
    which breeds these evils. The defense of the Soviet Union is one of our
    principal tasks. (<I>Partisan Review </I>1, no. 1 [Feb.-March 1934]: 2)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The issue opens with two short short stories about social injustice
  by Grace Lumpkin, but otherwise, its contributors (all of them white male)
  resort to the Poetic Diction I described above. Here again are Farrell
  (an extract from <I>Studs Lonigan</I>) and Rolfe, whose &quot;Poem for
  May First&quot; is a clarion call urging the comrades to create a brave
  new world in the image of the new Soviet Union. Here is an excerpt&quot;

  have an interesting subtext.</P>
  <P>And indeed by 1937 the <I>Partisan Review</I> had not only dissociated
  itself from the John Reed Club, but was publishing mainstreammodernist
  and neo-modernist works: the December 1937 issue featured Delmore Schwartz's
  &quot;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities,&quot; Wallace Stevens's &quot;The
  Dwarf,&quot; an essay by William Troy called &quot;The Symbolism of Zola,&quot;
  and reviews by Lionel Trilling, Arthur Mizener, Sidney Hook, and Philip
  Rahv. Within a few years, <I>Partisan Review</I> poetry, fiction, and criticism
  were all but indistiguishable from the poetry, fiction, and criticism of
  the &quot;conservative&quot; <I>Kenyon Review</I>, founded in 1939. The
  first issue of the <I>Kenyon</I>, for that matter, included Delmore Schwartz's
  essay &quot;The Two Audens&quot; and Philip Rahv's &quot;Franz Kafka: The
  Hero as Lonely Man.&quot;</P>
  <P>So began the rapprochement between the Left and its supposed enemy,
  the New Criticism. Meanwhile, the &quot;other&quot; or &quot;aesthetic&quot;
  radical wing had a harder time of it. &quot;Poor ol White Mule,&quot; wrote
  Williams sadly to Richard Johns in late 1933, &quot;I wish I could go on
  with it. Not a word have I written on it since Pagany busted&quot; (ARP
  511). Not until1937, when a young publisher named James Laughlin came into
  the picture, did Williams have the heart to finish his novel, which Laughlin
  offered to bring out. </P>
  <P>The Objectivists and related <I>Pagany</I> poets had a harder time of
  it. Never published in mainstream little magazines like <I>Partisan Review</I>,
  they more or less went underground, not revived until the 1960s and 1970s,
  when first the Black Mountain / San Francisco poets and then the Language
  group took them up. At the <I>Poets of the Thirties</I> conference held
  at the University of Maine in June 1993, there were five sessions on Zukofsky
  alone and three apiece on Reznikoff, Loy, and Lorine Niedecker, whose Objectivist
  poetry began to appear shortly after the <I>Pagany</I> period. The keynote
  poetry reading, moreover, was given before a large and reverential audience,
  by the now ninety-year-old Carl Rakosi. The poetic of the 1930s, distinct
  as that poetic is from the modernism that immediately preceded it, seems
  finally to be getting its due. At the same time -- and perhaps this is
  why the early 1930s are so fascinating for us-- the split that haunts that
  American decade similarly haunts our own. The argument for &quot;radical&quot;
  subject-matter (never mind its mode of production or materiality) is once
  again being made, this time no longer for writers identified with a particular
  political party or movement, but for members of &quot;marginalized&quot;
  ethnic, racial, and gender groups. Now as then, identity politics often
  goes hand in hand with what turns out to be the most mainstream and conventional
  of aesthetics-- the minority group, its teeth unfanged, turned commodity
  on the <I>Bill Moyers Journal</I> and similar TV programs. A real Revolution
  of the Word, we learn from such publications as the <I>&quot;Obectivists&quot;Anthology
  </I>or <I>Pagany,</I> cannot be packaged; it inevitably involves the &quot;barbed-wire
  entanglements&quot; that made Harriet Monroe extremely nervous, even as
  she had the courage to give them a hearing.</P>
