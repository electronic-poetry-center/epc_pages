<font size=5>The Smile on the Face of a Kouros</font><p><font size=4>
This boy, of course, was dead, whatever that<br> 
might mean. And nobly dead. I think we should feel <br>
he was nobly dead. He fell in battle, perhaps, <br>
and this carved stone remembers him <br>
not as he may have looked, but as if to define<br>
the naked virtue the stone describes as his. <br>
One foot is forward, the eyes look out, the arms<br> 
drop downward past the narrow waist to hands <br>
hanging in burdenless fullness by the heavy flanks. <br>
The boy was dead, and the stone smiles in his death <br>
lightening the lips with the pleasure of something achieved:<br> 
an end. To come to an end. To come to death <br>
as an end. And coming, bring there intact, the full <br>
weight of his strength and virtue, the prize with which <br>
his empty hands are full. None of it lost, <br>
safe home, and smile at the end achieved. <br>
Now death, of which nothing as yet - or ever - is known,<br> 
leaves us alone to think as we want of it, <br>
and accepts our choice, shaping the life to the death.<br> 
Do we want an end? It gives us; and takes what we give <br>
and keeps it; and has, this way, in life itself, <br>
a kind of treasure house of comely form <br>
achieved and left with death to stay and be <br>
forever beautiful and whole, as if <br>
to want too much the perfect, unbroken form <br>
were the same as wanting death, as choosing death<br> 
for an end. There are other ways; we know the way <br>
to make the other choice for death: unformed <br>
or broken, less than whole, puzzled, we live <br>
in a formless world. Endless, we hope for no end.<br> 
I tell you death, expect no smile of pride<br> 
from me. I bring you nothing in my empty hands.<p>

William Bronk's 81st birthday party was a great success (I attended
the 80th), I was told (by Sherry Kearns). I phoned Bill that night and he
sounded at once more than happy and suffering from his usual severe
emphysema as well as a sudden fluctuation in his diabetic's sugar level
(due to, as he admitted, his having been "bad"--having eaten and drunk
things he shouldn't have), so we got off the phone quickly. His cousin had
a nice visit with him the next day. And the morning later, Dan O'Leary, a
painter friend who has been looking after Bill daily--bringing him the
paper, fresh milk, poking around the house for him or whatever--at first
couldn't find him and then, following the lengthy tube from Bill's oxygen
tank, discovered his body lying on a couch face up and arms crossed over
his chest. Bill had been dead for a while and so must have died perhaps
around midnight or so. Bill had left standing instructions to have his
body cremated as soon as possible, and so Dan had that done immediately.
There will be a gathering/service some time in April, once the ground is
soft enough for digging (the ashes to be buried in the family plot).
Besides this, a two-day symposium on Bill's work, planned for this
November at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ, will have
an added significance. <p>

<font size=5>William Bronk's Passing</font><p><font size=4> 

Although one saw him but rarely, there was a strong sense of bond between
us as two who had begun together back at the close of the 40s, in Cid
Corman's <i>Origin.</i> We had a mutual friend, a little older than I was
-- as
was Bill as well --Samuel French Morse, a friend also of Cid Corman's, by
way of Gordon Cairnie's transforming Grolier Book Shop in Cambridge. I was
trying to start a little magazine and Bill had sent me some poems (at
Sam's suggestion), which were printed in <i>Origin,</i> when the magazine
I
intended fell apart. Much has been said about William Bronk's relation to
Wallace Stevens. There is certainly an active sense of parallel,
particular in the pace, the reflective rhetoric, and in the use of
pronouns. But Stevens is a much lighter poet, if that's the word, letting
thought be both way in and way out, a play of mind rather than its adamant
conviction. It was not surprising when Stevens converted at last to
Catholicism. Bronk's Protestant determination never changed. I recall
those early poems had often a humor, neither droll nor necessarily
relieving. It was a humor of situation, that one was in this world indeed,
just so. Bill thought about it all his extraordinary life. In that he was
very like Emily Dickinson, seemingly alone yet compact with existence,
flooded with insistent intelligence and proposal. One notices how
particularly his poems return, loop, rather, about their factors of
statement. "Here" is the only place he ever was. Our first meeting was at
a reading I'd had in New York, and he came up to introduce himself just
after, but really to tell me with a look of real consternation, that he
would never have imagined I'd read my poems as I did, stuttering, seeming
almost in pain -- why? I had no answer. He read his own thoughtfully,
firmly, considering. When, a few years ago, he was unable to attend a
festival we were both to be at, a tape of his reading was provided , and
so
I sat with others listening to that dependable, quiet voice speak through
the lines of an age old human wondering. Why indeed, I thought -- it was a
good question. Back home, I called him to tell him all had gone well, and
we mused a bit on life, on what it had been to be poets. As he said, one
had never thought of it as a "career" or as any such. One did it simply.
Charles Olson valued him quite probably more than any other of his
contemporaries -- it was the measure of intelligence he constituted, the
address of his means to the given world. Finally, there was no one else
quite like him, so large in his singleness, so separate yet enclosing. One
will not see his like again.
