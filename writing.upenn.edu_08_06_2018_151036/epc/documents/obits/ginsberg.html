Allen Ginsberg has been diagnosed with liver cancer and is not given much
more time to live. There are articles about his illness in today's New York
Post and Philadelphia Inquirer.

I would imagine everyone reading this will have the same intense reaction I
am having. It seems like Allen Ginsberg has been with me all my life.

Piping down the valleys wild
Piping songs of pleasant glee
On a cloud I saw a child..
And he laughing said to me.

Pipe a song about a Lamb:
So I piped with merry chear,
Piper pipe that song again
So I piped he wept to hear.

Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe
Sing thy songs of happy chear
So I sung the same again
While he wept with joy to hear.

Piper sit thee down and write
In a book that all my read --
So he vanish'd from my sight,
And I plucked a hollow reed

And I made a rural pen,
And I stain'd the water clear,
And I wrote my happy songs,
Every child may joy to hear

The Daily News said 4 months to a year.

If it wasn't for Howl, I would have broken down in Pennsyvania; it was my
first epiphany. I found it at a local bookshop when it first came out; I
was around 13 at the time and already depressive.

I was about 13, too, when I first heard of Allen Ginsberg from my
7th-grade English teacher who clandestinely read us the beginning of Howl.
All I remember was that it wasn't the sing-songy verse we were usually
fed. I also remember wondering why our English teacher was being so
secretive. This was in 1965 or 1966. Now I know why and now I also know
that things haven't changed nearly enough.

i've never met allen ginsberg but i was within arms reach of him one late
afternoon many years ago. stephen rodefer was having allen talk about jack
kerouac for one of his ucsd literature classes and invited me to drop in. i
remember walking to the lecture hall and allen was walking in front of me
amidst a small crowd of people trying to get through the door. and i
remember he was wearing this dopey dark blue polyester sport coat and i
remember that nobody seemed to notice him really and i had the urge to tap
him on the shoulder and say "what's up with this ginsberg goofball anyway?"
but i didn't and obviously i've regretted it over all these years. and i've
regretted it because i've come to understand what a large and open sense of
humor he has.

This is sad, tho expected, news. I've had dreams in the past of receiving
such information, which I suppose says much about the depth to which he's
entered my own consciousness. I've always found Allen, in my limited
experience, to be among the most generous, open, encouraging, and dedicated
members of the poetry community. A leader in so many ways...

God bless him...

As if that would be a terrible thing? Oh, awful death. Let us not,
for it is not to be spoken of. Now since death is so pornographic,
what will be the first line of this renga?

Subject:      Allen Ginsberg's death

Here is the great equalizer, it would seem. Language is slippery,
pronouns are fuzzy, poetry is not poetry. But death? Death is death,
and there it is, no experimental messing with it.

I suspect Ginsberg would not want any sentimental sniffling. He's
been talking about death for a long time. I remember at the Orono
conference in--was it--'93? I approached Ginsberg after
his reading there and introduced myself as the person who had edited
the Buddhist anthology of contemporary American poets in which he
prominently figured. I was sure he
owuld be impressed, probably would embrace me warmly, since clearly
this was the most important anthology to appear in post-war America,
intro by Gary Snyder, numerous avant-garde poets along with big
mainstreams, unknowns, etc. He had a red bandanna tied to four corners
around his head, sipped deeply on a soda and said in a decidedly
laconic way: Oh, so yu're the guy who did that... And then he turned
and started talking to someone else.

I felt hurt and felt resentlful for a good time after that--
especially after riding back to the motel in the same van
with him and he was yakkety yakketing with Marjorie Perloff and
Jerome McGann and it was as if I was not there. Invisible. Look Allen,
I have adored you, wanted to be like you, wondered what it would be
like to walk down the street with you, read you out loud with my
friends inthe bar, and all you can do after I edit a Buddhist
anthology of poetry is treat me like shit.

Did I think to myself: I wish you would die, motherfucker. (but no,
no, I don't mean that,that's a wrong thing to feel, that's jsut my
drunkenness, I'm not that kind of dperson...)

And of course he will. And of course all of us will. The intensity
comes out of the factness of death, doesn't it, like a beatnik on acid
with beads, staring us in the face with all of his teeth? Now I
realize death was probably teaching me a lesson, saying so what if
you did so and so, you sorry idiot? No merit.

So don't be sad. I'll bet Allen wouldn't want it that way. But then
again, I could be worng. And only death will prove us all, in the end,
immaculately right. Right?

Singing "Father Death" & Blake's Songs, Allen's left more life than death
can take away. Don't feel bad, Kent. He brushed me off once, after I read
a few poems at the WCW festival in Paterson, as "very intelligent." No
blame. Om Kavaye Namah. [Honor to the Great Poet.]

Not scared, but struck by the sublime: that 18th century sense of the
awe-ful or, as Blake says, who died singing of angels, the "terrific":
"portions of eternity, too great for the eye of man." Scared of what?

I'm with you Kent & Alan. Listening right now to P. Glass's "Wichita Vortex
Sutra" which sounds all of a sudden like ave atque vale.

And I'm truly surprised by how hard and how deeply Allen's death is
affecting me. I've driven around town today in a weird daze, everything
feeling and looking uncanny, as if a great silent shockwave had passed
through the world and nobody's noticed, nobody's noticed at all. And
everything is the same and goes on being the same, just as it ought. It
ought to be the same. Only it isn't and it can't be. But it's the same all
the same and only this very weird feeling of a tiny vacuum at the center of
things.

I never knew Allen; only brushed by him twice in passing as it were. The
first time was 1989 at City Lights, the day before the quake and the Series
and I was handing out copies of a miserable poetry rag I'd put together and
which is best forgotten but we bumped into each other at the crowded front
counter and naturally being alert for  favorable omens I was delighted. The
second time was last year in Anselm Hollo's backyard where I found myself
sitting, rather like Aldon, apart from the main group, on a lawn chair, and
Allen and his nephew I guess it was Al came up and joined my wife and I and
Lindsay Hill. We were all eating veggie burgers and watermelon and I thought
how frail Allen looks and then he and Lindsay talked a bit about somebody's
mother, maybe it was Steven Marks'? maybe not - the name has faded. He was
wearing bright red suspenders which I put into a poem a few days later. And
that was all very funny really since I'd panned his last book in a brief
review I'd done for the Daily Camera and was mortally afraid to introduce
myself in case someone had told him about it and that review was how Anselm
Hollo and I met, by vigourous exchange of letter, and eventually led me to
joining the list so I owe it this chance of expression and amends I guess in
retrospect to my hubristic attempt to take Allen Ginsberg down a notch what
a silly thing to do and I will miss him who else has done more for poetry
and there should be a state funeral if there was such a thing as a state
with honor that could see itself that way but then what need for Allen
Ginsberg except the example of his beauty and anyway such ceremonies are
deceptive flatteries that cannot take the place or can they of real grieving
as this list will do very nicely even better for that I say.

I intend to get drunk tonight and watch Jerry Aronson's "The Life & Times of
Allen Ginsberg."

Charles, I am glad that you quoted that poem. I have been today and
yesteday trying to call up all my Allen memories since first talking with
him on his return from Asia, 1963. And you reminded me of the time I drove
Allen westward thru the streets of Montreal, probably 1969, and he sat
beside me and sang that song, pumping on that weird meoleon or whatever it
was from India. so I veered off the street and took him and banged on F.R.
Scott's door, and introduced the 2 poets, and Frank made one  of his famous
martinis for us, and I do believe that AG drank his, too.

From: <b>Steve Shoemaker</b> [shoemakers@COFC.EDU]
Subject:      Re: Allen Ginsberg / No Apologies

No need for apologies, David, as far as I can see.  And there was nothing
"superficial" about your "dabbling"--that's just *writing*.  I think
Kent's right that everyone will deal with the news in their own way, and
in their own time.  As it happens, I feel like writing--out of the sense
expressed by others of Allen's death sudden and hard, harder even than
might have been expected.  I saw/heard Allen "live" on two occasions, most
recently at the Orono Confernece in '93.  There, thanks to Burt Hatlen's
generosity, I got the chance to introduce Allen's tandem reading with Carl
Rakosi.  That double reading was a moving & beautiful event for me, a
bridging and spanning of poetic lives & energies drawing on experience of
the better part of the century (Carl 88 at the time).  The other time I
heard Allen read was when i was an undergrad at U of MD, College Park, ca.
'83 or '84.  I think Allen must have read, or rather performed, for about
an hour and a half or 2 hours--reciting, chanting, singing & playing that
little harmonium--or whatever it's called.  As i recall, he did it all
from memory, no recourse at all to the printed word, a real
bard--something i have not heard/seen anyone do since. I made a tape,
using a cheap little portable recorder, and just now, remarkably, i
managed to dig this tape out of an old box of junk.  I rewound it to the
beginning of a side, which turned out to be side 2, coming in somewhere in
the   middle of the reading.  The first words are Allen asking a question
"Go on...?" asking the audience whether he shld keep going, and the crowd
responding w/ rousing affirmation. (As i remember it, it was a not very
large room filled to overflowing, people standing in the corners & sitting
on the floors, spilling out into the halls--the tape is full of sounds of
people gabbing, chatting & laughing between & sometimes during poems.)
Then Allen begins talking about the death of his father from cancer, &
reads 2 sections from "Don't Grow Old," and then sings/plays "Father Death
Blues."  My first listen-thru to this sitting at the kitchen table sent a
chill up my spine, & then when i tried to play it again the tape began to
self-destruct, but i did manage to transcribe Allen's intro to the poems:

"1976--On the death of my father, Louis Ginsberg, who was a poet...who was
a considerably gifted lyric poet...& for the 10 years before he died, at
the age of 80, I gave poetry readings with him & we were relatively close.
He died of cancer in 1976, in a relatively philosophic mood, without much
pain.  So these are a few notes & a song written during his illness &
after his death.  He was a high school teacher & he used to teach
Wordsworth...and, uh, Poe.  So I've learned a lot of poetry from him..."

[reads sections 3&4 of "Don't Grow Old"]  (Even on this very poor tape,
his wonderfully warm, expressive, charismatic, humorous, playful voice
comes over.)

III.

Wasted arms, feeble knees
        80 years old, hair thin & white
                cheek bonier than I'd remembered--
head bowed on his neck, eyes opened
        now and then, he listened--
  I read my father Wordsworth's *Intimations of Immortality*
[Allen reads following quote w/ deep and comical sonority]
"...trailing clouds of glory do we come
        from God, who is our home..."
                "That's beautiful," he said, "but it's not true."

"When I was a boy, we had a house
        on Boyd Street, Newark--the backyard
                was a big empty lot full of bushes and tall grass,
        I always wondered what was behind those trees.
When I grew older, I walked around the block,
        and found out what was back there--
                it was a glue factory."

[as read, father's story hits quite funny note of anticlimax, audience
laughs--Allen helping them to see this humor even in death]


IV.

[Reads opening question w/ great, childish credulity]

Will that happen to me?
Of course, it'll happen to thee.

Will my arms wither away?
Yes yr arm hair will turn gray.

Will my knees grow weak & collapse?
Your knees will need crutches perhaps.

Will my chest get thin?
Your breasts will be hanging skin.

Where will go--my teeth?
You'll keep the ones beneath.

What'll happen to my bones?
They'll get mixed up with stones.

All of yesterday and today at the Austin International Poetry Festival,
people have been performing pieces for and about Ginsberg (Friday in

erupted at one venue, where various parts of the audience got into

     Beat Poet Laureate Ginsberg Dies

     NEW YORK (AP) -- Allen Ginsberg, the poet laureate of the Beat
     Generation whose writing and lifestyle shaped the music, politics
     and protests of the next 40 years, died this morning. He was 70.

     Ginsberg died in his Lower East Side apartment at 2:39 a.m. of a
     heart attack related to his terminal liver cancer, said Bill
     Morgan, his friend and archivist. The poet was surrounded by family
     and friends.

     Ginsberg suffered from chronic hepatitis for years, which
     eventually led to cirrhosis of the liver. His diagnosis of terminal
     liver cancer was made eight days ago and made public on Thursday.
     He suffered a stroke Thursday night and slipped into a coma.

     Ginsberg has spent several days in a hospice after the diagnosis,
     but then decided he wanted to return home.

     ``He was very energetic,'' Morgan said. ``He wore himself out
     (Thursday) talking to friends and writing poems.''

     He wrote about a dozen short poems on Wednesday. One of the last
     was titled ``On Fame and Death''; others ran the gamut from nursery
     rhymes to politics.

     During the McCarthy era in the 1950s, when TV's married couples
     slept in separate beds, Ginsberg wrote ``Howl'' -- a profane,
     graphic poem that dealt with his own homosexuality and communist
     upbringing.

     ``I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness,
     starving hysterical naked, '' began the seminal ``Howl.'' It was
     dedicated to Carl Solomon, a patient he met during a stay in a
     psychiatric ward.

     Ginsberg became America's most popular and recognizable poet, his
     balding, bearded visage one of the enduring images of the 1950s
     beatnik explosion of Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs and Neal
     Cassady. The group, disillusioned with conventional society,
     created their own subculture.

     Ginsberg's acolytes comprised a who's who of pop culture: Bob
     Dylan, Yoko Ono, Vaclav Havel, Patti Smith, Michael Stipe and Billy
     Corgan.

     Irwin Allen Ginsberg was born June 3, 1926, in Newark, N.J., the
     second son of poet Louis Ginsberg and his wife, Naomi. The family
     moved to Paterson, N.J., while Ginsberg was a youngster.

     Ginsberg intended to become a lawyer and enrolled at Columbia
     University. But while still a teen-ager, he fell in with a crowd
     that included Kerouac, Burroughs and Cassady -- the leaders of what
     became known as the Beat Generation.

     ``I think it was when I ran into Kerouac and Burroughs when I was
     17 that I realized I was talking through an empty skull,'' Ginsberg
     once said. ``I wasn't thinking my own thoughts or saying my own
     thoughts.''

     Ginsberg's first taste of notoriety came after the publication of
     ``Howl'' in 1956. Copies of the book were seized by San Francisco
     police and U.S. Customs officials, and publisher Lawrence
     Ferlinghetti was charged with publishing an obscene book.

     Ferlinghetti was acquitted a year later, but the case generated
     enormous publicity for Ginsberg and his work. Ginsberg was suddenly
     in demand.

     One of his other great works, ``Kaddish,'' was a confessional work
     dealing with his mother's life and death in a mental hospital. It
     was written, stream of consciousness-style, in his Manhattan
     apartment, fueled by a combination of amphetamines and morphine.

     Ginsberg experimented heavily with drugs, taking LSD under the
     guidance of the late Timothy Leary in the 1960s.

     As he grew older, Ginsberg became a guru to the counterculture
     movement. He coined the term ``flower power.'' He was arrested in
     1967 for protesting against the Vietnam War in New York, and
     tear-gassed a year later while protesting at the Democratic
     convention in Chicago.

     His National Book Award came in 1973 for ``The Fall of America:
     Poems of These States, 1965-1971.'' He was a finalist for a
     Pulitzer Prize in poetry in 1995 for his book, ``Cosmopolitan
     Greetings: Poems 1986-1992.''

     Ginsberg toured with Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue in 1977, doing
     spontaneously composed blues poems. He toured Eastern Europe in
     1986, receiving an award in the former Yugoslavia, recording with a
     Hungarian rock band and meeting a congress of young Polish poets.

     ``In the Eastern bloc, the people realize the governments are up to
     no good, whereas Americans still maintain that the government is
     looking after their best interest,'' Ginsberg said at the time.

     Ginsberg remained vital and active well into his 60s, performing in
     Manhattan nightclubs and doing poetry readings. Last year, he
     recorded his poem ``The Ballad of the Skeletons'' with musical
     backing from Paul McCartney and Philip Glass.

     He did a video version of the poem, a pre-election political rant.
     At 69, Ginsberg's video appeared in heavy rotation on MTV's ``Buzz
     Bin.''

     The funeral will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations should
     be sent to Jewel Heart Buddhist Center in Ann Arbor, Mich.

i'm half jewish.  why only half he sd.)  later that summer i spent a few
minutes in bed w/ him before i bailed.
the last time i saw ginsberg 1996 was at St Marks do for Bob Kaufman. we
both presented stuff along w/ many others. (i'd had many encounters w/ him
in between, and often he seemed petulant and distracted as i was awkward
around him and not of the right gender for commanding his attention.  one
time i wove him a white silk opera scarf.  when i gave it to him he sd
what's an opera scarf, i sd it's what they all wear in proust novels, so he
seemed happy with it or at least gracious about accepting it.)  so, last
time i saw ginsberg about a year ago after the kaufman evening's ceremonies
i pulled him aside and said, allen i want to tell you something i think you
would understand. when i saw bob kaufman's ashes i put some of them in my
mouth.  he said, yes, that's a very common understandable impulse, eating
the ashes of the dead. he was nice, tender as he'd been all evening when
recounting tales of kaufman, not petulant and distracted but patient and
kind, i thought, he knows he's going to die soon, that' why he's being so
nice.  then ira cohen? or someone? snapped a photo of us that i would love
