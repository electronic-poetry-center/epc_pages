 THE NEW ENGLAND CENTER sits like a nest into a boulder-spattered
wooded hillside on the edge of the University of New Hampshire
campus. &quot;To assemble,&quot; &quot;one or <I>other</I> of
two,&quot; etc.--well, here it was: &quot;Assembling Alternatives&quot;
sang like a bird's egg, snug in the downy center of its forest
loft. And what could be more to the point? Robbin' these words
from all points of the compass! Like the Vancouver conference
of last summer, this conference enjoyed not only splendid weather
(made even more delicious by the impending--though never arriving--sledge
hammer of hurricane Edouard aka Hugo Ball rolling up the coast)
but a similar (though not author-based) focus and an exhilarating
sense of multi-Englished poetries. (Aussi avec un peu de Queb&eacute;coise!)
For a brief few days, New England became New Englishes, words
falling ah from the clear blue skies.

<P>
<img src="images/chaos.gif" align=left hspace=10 border=1>
<br> Unlike larger conferences (and the word &quot;conference&quot;
shouldn't even be used here) where words tend to sediment into
a drone, Assembling Alternatives offered a gourmet feast of language
leaping electrified across continents, seas, and islands. The
talks were terrific, the readings offered one after another exemplar
of how experimental writing (also sometimes called &quot;linguistically-innovative&quot;
writing--among other terms) might propose itself--and how also it
might NOT be limited. Despite the wide range of pronunciations,
dialects, sets of vernacular, tropes, themes, perspectives, and
forms, Assembling Alternatives allowed a multi-voiced rendering
of innovative language-languages that never once sat still nor
relented on their challenge to the gourmet-fed, sleep-deprived,
conversation-charged, tone-ecstatic, grammar-doubting assemblers.
<P>
 As I mentioned in the talk I gave--and this was completely earnest--listing
the linguistic predecessors to electronic poetries--

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Following World War II, the examination of system in Olson, Duncan
and Blaser's serial works, Creeley's numeric determinations, Bernstein,
Silliman, Grenier, Howe's radical typographies, the explorations
of language by Maggie O'Sullivan, Karen MacCormack, Joan Retallack,
and Hannah Weiner--<I>and the work of all those listed in this
conference program</I>--and the alleatories of Mac Low and Cage
point in different ways to various forms of nonlinearity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

--that present in New Hampshire was a regiment of innovators that
pointed in all these ways (as Gertrude Stein puts it: &quot;a
spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement
in a system to pointing.&quot;) There could hardly be a better
assembly in this day and age to put forward what I wanted to say.
It is hard to mention any specific participants (this is my point!)
without doing disservice to the fact that the quality and strengths
of nearly all of those present, were unveeringly strong. However,
evening readings through the penultimate night alone offered the
likes of Maggie O'Sullivan, Kathleen Fraser, Ken Edwards, Joan
Retallack, Tom Raworth, Pierre Joris, Leslie Scalapino, Allen
Fisher, Catherine Walsh, Steve McCaffery, Robert Sheppard, Karen
MacCormack, Charles Bernstein, Bob Perelman, Denise Riley, Abigail
Child, Barrett Watten, and Nicole Brossard, among other great
readers.
<P>
 What, beside this extraordinary talent, made the conference so
useful? One fact was the significant presence of women poets.
(Out of 39 evening slots, for example, 16 were occupied by women--not
yet representative but a sight better than most events.) Further,
typically marginalized areas of working were brought straight
onto the stage. 
<P>
One of these was performance poetry. The wide participation by
performance poets was inspiring--and the final night's reading
turned out to be a state of the art f&ecirc;te, gala, grand &#133;
FESTIVAL (after all, this word was right on the conference program!)
on how experimental poets might perform the word. In one evening,
in a sticky Portsmouth theatre briefly stolen from the Rocky Horror
Picture Show, performance/artists/poets such as David Bromige,
Fiona Templeton, cris cheek, Paul Dutton, Caroline Bergvall, Hazel
Smith, Christian B&ouml;k, and Se&aacute;n &Oacute;hUig&iacute;n
each took to the brightly-colored, multi-leveled stage. Sound
poets Dutton and B&ouml;k performed at the apex of sound poetry's
possibilities. cris cheek provided a multi-voiced tour de force.
Bergvall may've stolen the show with her understated style, her
poignant delivery, her arched body which seemed to act as a catapult
hurling her taut, multileveled sensual incantations sizzling into
the top rows of the Seacoast Repertory Theatre.
<P>

Another marginalized area brought into the spotlight was witnessed by
the inclusion of electronic media in the event--not only as a footnote
but somewhat prominently. Though this was conference was not about
electronic poetries let me congratulate Romana Huk for being one of
the first to recognize, by including such a panel in the discussion of
issues about innovative writing, that the formal issues about writing
at the heart of experimental poetries ARE THE SAME ISSUES being
explored by the literary electronic media. This is the first time I
know that in a literary conference this kinship of language concerns
has been addressed. This plenary session on electronic media included
John Cayley, Jim Rosenberg, Chris Funkhouser, and me. The question
period for this session was extremely animated. The main question: are
the electronic media torturing the word by their hidden codes? Or are
they providing tools to be used in an exploration of the possibilities
of language?  Though this matter wasn't brought to a final rest, the
afternoon readings that day, with poets working in electronic
media asterisked (my spell checker just suggested &quot;ostriches&quot; or
&quot;austerities&quot; here) certainly helped to
suggest an answer to this question.

<P>
This is perhaps a poet's perspective. Events such as this can
always, in hindsight, be found to have shortcomings. But as a
venue for <I>listening</I> to such poets reading and talking,
the conference was an intense aural glee over too soon. And now?
Many more books (and writing in other forms) to read. Edouard?
Extratropical to the south of Nova Scotia, so says the Florida
State University Meteorology Department. Thankfully, I still see
pine trees and can now more vividly sense Irish intonations as
I read&#133;<BR>

I have a question for all my dear friends on this List:<br>
if, as Alan Golding reminded us in his paper, there isn't supposed to be a
real divide between poetry and theory, if, as "linguistically innovative"
writers have been saying for 20 years or more, genres are fluid, hybrid,
etc etc., why is it that at "Assembling Alternatives" the critics were
absolutely second-class citizens?  The poets got to read for 20 minutes
and give 20 minute papers; the critics and scholars got to give 20 minute
papers, often in slots where there was no time for discussion.  The poets
are listed in the brochure, with pics and bios; the critics, all of whom
paid their way to this conference (in my case over $1,000) were invisible
in that regard.<p>
Do we then still believe in the secondariness of critical discourse?
Would critics have been allowed to spend their 20 minute "papers"
schmoozing about this and that as some of the poets who gave papers did?
And if so, how is all this "linguistically innovative" discourse any
different from the good old poetry festival attended by poets only?
<p>
A second important issue which also relates back to the Orono conference:
I think that when there's no time for discussion, as there wasn't here,
really strange things happen.  People will make authoritative statements
that may in fact be just plain wrong.  No one calls the person on it, no
one takes up the issues--and there we are.  Philip Mead came all the way
from Australia for the conference, spoke for 20 minutes on the situation
in Australian poetry which is fascinating and that was that.  No
questions, no responses.
<p>
There were many exhilerating moments and wonderful readings and for those
of us from the U.S. it was very exciting to meet (however briefly in the
endless marathon) the British poets.  But it remains wholly unclear to me
who was allowed to read or perform, what makes some of the people who read
or performed "linguistically innovative" or "alternative," and so on.  I
wonder if anyone else shares my frustration.

gyrating his hands and saying I am exciting the molecules in front of your

out of his disillusionment with baseball, Miles Champion who reads faster
than Tom Raworth, seeing Jim Rosenberg's screen of overlapping words &
realizing it to be a representation of Miles Champion's tonal clusters yes I
find hearing Miles Champion read not to be a diachronic event, Juliana Spahr
saying there were three poems with monkey penises tonight, Peter Culley
saying well what would Ted Berrigan do, meeting John Wilkinson who really saw
the marginalization of Rodefer and we thought maybe Rodefern gets more

Romana Huk being gracious and doing a great job, Fiona Templeton taking the
skirt off the plenary session table, Steve McCaffery wanting to install
trousers on its the exposed legs, noting that the daughters of albion took
their breakfast together, Barrett Watten saying Eliot was most British when
a) he was refusing to incorporate popular culture into his pomes or b) not
having sex, Tony Lopez calling Barrett Watten ignorant & Barrett Watten
saying he didn't appreciate being addressed in that manner, Billy Miles
saying he's sick of americanocentrism, wondering about the assumed center of
language poets in the "experimental community," Tony Door saying he always
thought experimental meant like Jackson Jackson and that l-poets weren't
experimental in a scientific sense, Barrett Watten saying his first degree
was in science & usually people criticise him & camp as being too lab coaty
 oh and Joan Retallack is rigorous, lots of folks wondering where the people

I understand Marjorie Perloff's frustration about the lack of time for
discussion at the New Hampshire poetry conference/festival: the best
discussions I had there were informal and private, and I feel that
many of the most interesting questions didn't get asked in a public
forum. But to some degree at least I think those who came as critics
(a group in which I include myself) were responsible for this state of
affairs: I noticed that people tended to go over the allotted time
limit, even when they skipped passages of the essay that they'd come
to read.  Had all of the papers actually _been_ 20 minutes long, there
would have been time to start some interesting discussions.
<p>
<a name="out"></a>
<img src="images/outeverywhere.gif" border=1 align=left hspace=10>
As far as the question of the status of critics goes, Marjorie raises
an interesting point.  Although I have nothing to complain about
personally (I had the opening slot on the first plenary session) the
critics did only get to speak once, and the poets tended to both
address critical issues and to read from or perform their work.  There
is a bit of a conundrum here, though: if poets are restricted to only
one activity, we are deprived of the "poet's prose" that can often be
so valuable, especially with experimental work; if critics are allowed
to read twice in order to receive as much attention as poets,
conference schedules will be even more crowded than they already are,
and there will be even less time for discussion.  The real solution,
of course, would be to have longer conferences, but who has the
funding (or the time)?
<p>
All that aside, I look at my schedule from New Hampshire and realize
that it was a miracle that this conference came into being, and think
that Romana Huk deserves our thanks for pulling it all together.

Subject:      my two senses
<p>

Dear all--to those of you who were in New Hampshire, it was delightful
meeting you again or for the first time.  Best to Romana, who did an
absolutely terrific job.<p>
A few comments, following Marjorie Perloff, if not exactly on the same
subjects, and perhaps too autobiocritical:<p>
--I felt least at home toward the beginning of the conference when I
encountered utter culture shock moving from a place (Hawai'i) where
Caucasians are a minority to a place (the conf) where there was hardly anyone
else and I had the sense that differences were being hidden under a rhetoric
of assembling samenesses;<p>
--I felt most at home at the end of the last panel during the postcolonial
moment (this was when the culture shock wore off quickly!) when suddenly the
Welshman was chiding the Englishman for colonizing the concept of "bard" and
the Irishman was critiquing the American poets for being provincial and the
Australians were silent perhaps because they were not even on the billing,
though Phillip Mead and Ann Vickery and Hazel Smith were very much in
attendance and participating brilliantly, and I felt compelled to make
trouble about the lack of multicultural input from my peripheral perspective
in mid-Pacific (actually, I'm now in New York state, but no matter, I'm still
jetlagged by several hours).<p>
--This reminded me of local Asian American writers in Hawai'i telling
mainland white writers and critics that they didn't know enough about Hawai'i
and were getting things so very wrong.  It reminded me of Hawaiian writers
and critics telling both local Asian writers and mainland haoles that they
were appropriating the place for their own interests.  It was so damn
contentious that I felt right back at home.<p>
--So I'm glad we met and listened to too much stuff and looked at pictures of
some poets and heard critics through the interstices (cf. Marjorie P).  And
I'm actually glad that we fought a bit.<p>
--In response to something Steve Evans, whose work I greatly admire, said to
me.  No, I don't think that I was assuming that this conference as normative
and that we should invite others to participate in it.  Rather, I think we
should change the entire rhetoric of our "alternative" conferences to
include--in a REAL sense--writers who are not white and who are marginalized
in very different ways from Language writers--marginalized by class and
language and race, rather than by position or stance,  such that a genuine
and noisy dialogue would ensue.  How's about Language writers (we all know
their names!) and Hagedorn and Yamanaka and LKJ and Brathwaite and Barry
Masuda (a former student and wonderful local/Language writer) and others and
others all together under one hothouse roof??  This involves more than just
inviting people.  It involves re-figuring our rhetoric about ourselves a bit.
 And it would be exciting--to cite just one imagined example--to see cris
cheek perform with a dub poet and to hear the music of what happened (to
quote a name much hissed at).<p>
--This is where I admired Bob Perelman's brief plea for intelligibility.
 Yes, the poetry should be, can be, as unintelligible as possible.  But the
explanations need to be there and be good.  In my classrooms the explanations
are rewarded with some interest.  Otherwise, any Language writer, no matter
how revolutionary and subversive her rhetoric is "just another white guy" in
Hawai'i--or other places off the beaten monocultural track--and will not get
noticed except as another imperial presence.  Ten people, all of them lobbied
frenetically, will show up to her reading in a large auditorium, because
they've already seen, or think they've seen, too many such "white guys"
before.  Unless that engagement is entered into, and shouted about, certain
assumptions, which are often untrue, will govern.  This is not a sell out,
but a possible connection with writers who are doing similar, if different
(of course!) projects, and who would not be reached or reach "us" without the
effort.<p>
--My aol bill is increasing geometrically!  A fond good bye to all.

I write in a state of exhaustion & jetlag, so forgive me. New Hampshire was
quite overwhelming, and I share the sense of excitement in Loss Glazier's and
Bill Luoma's posts.
<p>
In reply to Marjorie, with the greatest respect to her and her critical kindred
(and I was very pleased to meet her for the first time -- her energy &
erudition
reminded me somewhat of the late Eric Mottram, whose irascible shade I felt
hovered over New Hampshire like that hurricane that never arrived):
I was glad to be part of an event in the academy in which poets prevailed.
Speaking for myself, I would not have been able to attend if I hadn't had
financial assistance from the conference -- thanks, Romana. It was right that
poets without access to the institutional support of the academy should have
been helped in this way, and that they were the focus of the event
(embarrassing
as those pics in the brochure were!). I too was sorry that Philip Mead's
excellent paper on the Australian scene provoked no discussion, but perhaps
this
was not unconnected with the fact that there were no Australian poets present,
so it was decontextualised.
<p>
I think some of Marjorie's points are answered quite well by Robert Archambeau,
so I won't take any more space here. My only beef about the panel sessions was
that people tended to turn up to those panels addressing subjects they already
knew, rather than seeking out, um, alternatives. (I am amazed that anyone
at all
turned up at 8.30 in the morning to my own talk on British small presses, but
disappointed they were mostly Brits who knew it all backwards anyway.)
<p>
Revelations for me (here I disregard the British contingent, and others whose
acts I already know & love): Lisa Robertson's fierce intellectual girlishness,
Leslie Scalapino's spine-chillingly wonderful voice, Rae Armantrout's humour,
Abigail Child (including such of her films I managed to catch), Christian Bok's
virtuoso vocals. There was an unfortunate sense that the afternoon readings
were
second-billing to the evenings, and I wish I'd caught more than the last five
minutes of Jeff Derksen; I also enjoyed Lee Ann Brown, Peter Gizzi, Deanna
Ferguson, Juliana Spahr and Chris Stroffolino, among others.
<p>
The strong showing by women poets and critics has been mentioned. Good to
see an
Irish contingent, and Maurice Scully in particular was as great as always, but
the older Irishmen seemed strangely out of place here.
<p>
I'm sad it's all over, looking forward to the book and the video, a little more
hopeful that national barriers are coming down. The difficulties and
shortcomings are hugely outweighed by the thanks we owe Romana Huk for this
extraordinary thing happening at all.

<p>
Still too sleep-deprived to wash off the gallon of coffee I just poured over
my head, so a longer post will have to wait, if it's forthcoming at all, but
here's a few brief remarks regarding NH:
<p>
1)  You were there (or weren't) the day that "language poetry" died its most
public death.  But it was already dead.  Now that Frankenstein has been put to
rest, the question is whenceforth,and I expect that "language poets" will--as
they have begun to--provide SOME of the most provocative suggestions and
examples.
<p>
2)  Marjorie Perloff has been slugging it out on behalf of SOME of the most
vital work (in the US) for years in the crucial site (cf. my conference
remarks) of the academy.  She was the only academic critic of her gerneration
at the conference and deserved more time.  Money is another matter: Mills
and Catherine Walsh both work part-time in Dublin.  Etc. etc.
<p>
3)  American self-absorption and provincialism has been and is a problem (cf.
my conference remarks).  But anti-american sentiments have been (and are) a
problem too.  All of  these things have a history:  "americanocentrism" (what
a word) is an abstraction.  The whence now question involves a thinking-through
of the problems of distribution.  Allen Fisher, cris cheek, Peter Middleton,
Trevor Joyce, Alan Golding, and the zombie now typing had hoped to initiate
a public discussion of possible SOLUTIONS to these but the crush of events
prevented it.  This here little list might take up such a discussion.  Or it
can whine about this and that.
<p>
4)  Everybody (I hope) knows we have to rethink "alternative" with more
attention to ethnic, regional, class, and racial particularities.  But we also
have to reconsider its value in group formation (cf Peter Middleton), audience-
building and poetic practice (cf. Perelman), and political praxis (cf. Watten).
Charles Simic was at several of the readings.  Tapes should be sold cheap to
Helen Vendler, who has now (almost I'm told) managed to acknowledge Mina Loy.
<p>
5)  Re #3 above:  not only distribution but critical and institutional practice
vis-a-vis poetry and poetics.
<p>
6)  Open-panel discussions with poets and critics, more public space, mats for
free-style wrestling.  But Romana Huk deserves a medal, if she hasn't already
won one in long-distance running.
<p>
7)  More coffee please and some of those sour grapes.  Numbers 8-1997
forthcoming asap.  Hello again Saddam!

More New Hampshire post-mortem:<br>
I don't think I share Marjorie's sense of grievance at critics being treated
like second-class citizens at "AA."  Frankly I was happy enough to hear from
the poets twice over; their talks & readings were information-rich even when
they didn't succeed particularly well.  But I second Marjorie's complaint about
the lack of discussion-time.  Not only did good papers not get the responsesthey'd earned, but also people didn't get called often enough on statements
they ought to have been called on.
<p>
An example: at least twice, speakers casually knocked ethnopoetics, & there was
no opportunity to demand that they explain/justify themselves.  Well, we all
know that ethnopoetics was benighted -- racist -- neocolonialist -- primitivist
-- don't we?  It sure is lucky that we're enlightened now ....  I find it amaz-
ing that with all the constant chatter about historicizing this & historicizing
that we're (first-person plural to spread the blame around) still ready & will-
ing to apply present standards a-historically to past moments.  (Retrosepctive
self-righteousness is one of my favorite attitudes.)
<p>
Not that we shoudn't judge the past.  But a little fairness, please: remember
that the ethnopoetics project changed over time, & that its practitioners cor-
rected or repudiated earlier missteps; remember how valuable the whole project
was in expanding our collective sense of what "poetry" could be, of what "con-
temporary" could mean, etc.  In short: without the contribution of ethnopoetics
(among many other things) we wouldn't be in the position now to criticize retro
spectively the benighted neocolonialism, primitivism, etc. of ethnopoetics.Pity
the poor ladder: folks use it to climb, then just kick it away....  End of ser-
mon.

Apart from that, "AA" was a gas.  All honor to Romana Huk.
