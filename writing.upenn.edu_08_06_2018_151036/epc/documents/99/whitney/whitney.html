PROGRAM<P>
</center>


1. "Crease"
Texts and audio-mixing: Bruce Andrews
Dancer/Choreographer: Sally Silvers 
A piece combining intricate live editing of poems and mixing of prerecorded vocal sounds with solo dance 
improvisation<P>

2. "Super Fine Pitch (Y.D.M): A Duet by Edwin Torres and Sean Blacklung"
Vocals and texts: Edwin Torres
Percussion: Sean Blacklung
A duet in which Torres and Blacklung reveal their own symbiotic language as Torres performs his distinct 
brand of poetry incorporating vocal and physical improvisation, while Blacklung, on his drumset, responds 
spontaneously to Torres' words.  Torres and Blacklung have been working together in various contexts since 
1992.  To prepare for this evening's improvisation they have examined, "how the intention of being without 
intention can become to much of an intention."<P>

3. "Talk to Me: Dialogue in/and/as/or Improvisation"
Charles Bernstein uses dialogue as a theme for a solo, improvised performance.<br><br>

The RealVideo presentation of this event was produced by Anya Lewin, with the permission of the Whitney 
Museum. The videography was done by Mark Robison of Character Generator, Inc.  The program was part of a 
four-part series of interdisciplinary performances in which improvisation plays a central role.  The 
series was produced and curated by Deborah Singer, Director, Whitney Musueum of American Art at Phillip 
Morris.<P>
