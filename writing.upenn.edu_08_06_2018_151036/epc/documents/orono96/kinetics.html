<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> The mysterious title character of Thomas
Pynchon's first novel <I>V.</I> resembles in some ways Beckett's
&quot;Godot&quot; in her capacity to dominate the story almost
from its beginning without ever actually materialising within
it.  Pynchon emphasizes the allusive, symbolic nature of this
figure early in the tale:</FONT>
<blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  As spread thighs are to the libertine,
flights of migratory birds to</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  the ornithologist, the working part
of his tool bit to the production</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  machinist, so was the letter V to young
Stencil. He would dream</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  perhaps once a week that it had all
been a dream, and that</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  now he'd awakened to discover the pursuit
of V. was merely a </FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  scholarly quest after all, an adventure
of the mind, in the </FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  tradition of <I>The Golden Bough</I>
or <I>The White Goddess</I>.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">         (<I>V.</I> 50)</FONT>
</blockquote>

<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">Much more than the identity of a single
woman, the letter &quot;V&quot; in Pynchon's hands seems to evoke
an entire cultural order. Given such symbolic potency, it is not
surprising that Stencil, the agent of this epic search, becomes
frequently skeptical that any one object might eventually be rescued
from within this complex mythological matrix.  In the symbolic
landscape of Pynchon's text, even the most literal of material
quests threatens to dissipate into wider typologies at any given
moment. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Bereft of any actual objects Pynchon's
novel presents, accordingly, a rather effervescent image of the
American postwar state.  Although symbolically integrated, its
culture encourages a corresponding subjectivity that is completely
transient at best, unable to offer any definitive interpretation
of its surroundings.  As Stencil himself admits, in Pynchon's
modernity, there is neither a proper nor false way to read &quot;V&quot;.
 More than a single figure, V. hosts a wide variety of equally
arbitrary disguises, including Victory in Europe, the mythological
land of &quot;Vheissu&quot; and even Queen Victoria.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> As an initial symbol of the postwar
era, therefore, V. reigns supreme.  Yet, even her ubiquitous presence
at this time does not fully account for the intensely political
nature of her role in the 1949 trial of Alger Hiss for espionage.
 This time, &quot;V&quot; appears in one of her more culturally
authoritarian disguises: the little steel &quot;V&quot; in mechanical
typewriters that guides individual letters to the ribbon before
making an imprint.  In many models, there was an unfortunate tendency
for this &quot;V&quot; to bend under repeated use, thereby causing
it to mis-channel and disfigure the approaching letters.  In the
case of Alger Hiss, it was exactly this type of flawed mechanism
which misaligned the capital letters of his wife's old Woodstock,
thus incriminating the machine as the one typewriter that copied
sensitive government letters for Soviet agents during the Second
World War.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Given this new evidence, between twenty-five
and thirty FBI agents diligently combed Washington D.C. for the
unamerican typewriter.  As with Stencil's search in Pynchon's
narrative, however, this manifestation, too, of the enigmatic
V. was to remain elusive -- though not before causing much anxiety
in the public mind.  For one brief moment, a disfigured symbol
revealed itself from inside the wider spectacle.  A gap appeared
within the cultural order, one serious enough to require the corrective
energies of the police state.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> As most accounts of the trial maintain,
eventhough the typewriter was never found, the disruptive and
ephemeral manner in which Hiss's capital letters escaped the lines
of type contributed more publically to his image as traitor than
any actual material evidence.  Hiss's  typographic offenses, in
other words, conveyed symbolically what his prosecutors had long
suspected: that in a cultural matrix as seamless and fully incorporated
as that produced by the bi-polar politics of the cold war, any
typewriter could be mistaken for an enemy agent.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> The prominent role of this machine in
generating modern cultural meaning appears also in Olson's writing
when he notes its unique ability to provide a more direct connection
between the individual and his/her community.  &quot;It is the
advantage of the typewriter&quot; Olson declares in his 1950 statement,
&quot;Projectivist Verse&quot;, &quot;that due, to its rigidity
and its space precisions, it can, for a poet, indicate exactly
the breath, the pauses, the suspensions even of syllables, the
juxtapositions even of parts of phrases, which he intends&quot;
(S<I>elected Writings</I> 22).  The typewriter, Olson recognised,
initiated a profoundly different relationship between writers
and language as a medium of symbolic exchange.  In general, one's
access to an entire network of ongoing cultural production seemed
much more immediate and comprehensive.  Exactly &quot;how far,&quot;
Olson admits in this essay, &quot;a new poet can stretch the very
conventions on which communication by language rests, is too big
for these notes,...&quot;; nevertheless, the potential for intensive
social revision never seemed quite so convenient.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> In his poetics, Olson continued to emphasize
a widely inclusive typology, one that featured, as with <I>V.</I>
a fairly ephemeral social vision.  Within this typology, one's
engagement with the symbolic begins at the very level of breath,
itself, producing what has been commonly described as a kinetic,
fluid theory of language.  This more immediate, direct sense of
symbolic exchange prefaces, for Olson, an entirely new epistemology,
one that originates in the development of the natural sciences
of the 19th century.  At that time, Olson notes, </FONT>
<blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  An idea shook loose, and energy became
as important a </FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  structure of things as that they are
plural, and, by matter, </FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  mass. It was shown that in the infinitely
small the older</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  concepts of space ceased to be valid
at all...Nothing</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  was now inert fact, all things were
there for feeling, to </FONT>
<bR>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  promote it, and to be felt....</FONT>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">      (<I>Selected Writings</I> 47-48)
</blockquote>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">In this manner, Olson abandons a conventional
object-oriented perception for a more relativistic, internalised
sense of things, what Olson called &quot;proprioception&quot;.
 An elusive term at best, &quot;proprioception&quot; has inspired
a wide array of definitions ranging from Duncan's ontology of
the body to what Stephen Fredman characterises as a &quot;spiritual
discipline,&quot; based upon a &quot;bottomless sense of self
as founded on inexhaustible mystery&quot;.  Robin Blaser also
defines these themes in Olson's poetry as &quot;spiritual&quot;
in the sense that they outline a type of &quot;cosmology&quot;.
 In an essay comparing Olson's poetics to the philosophy of Alfred
N. Whitehead, Blaser contends that &quot;the most striking matter
of these poetics ...is the fundamental struggle for the nature
of the real.  And this, in my view, is a spiritual struggle, both
philosophical and poetic&quot; (<I>Line</I> 2 62).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Olson first encountered many of these
more philosophical themes through the poetry of Ezra Pound.  The
younger poet studied Pound throughout the 1940s and was among
his first visitors at St.Elizabeth's.  In Pound's intellectual
forays into fascism and moral dogmatism, however, Olson quickly
glimpsed the more disturbing social ramifications of an uncritical,
propagandistic use of aesthetics.  The politics of Olson's poetics
suggest, accordingly, a very different agenda.  On guard against
any overtly politicised use of culture for social change, Olson
remained skeptical that a revolutionary poetics would ever be
justified.  Rather an alternate, more capacious assessment of
what comprises a discourse's social legitimacy tended to neutralise
all explicit ideological censure.  If there are resistant factors
in his poetics, they derive solely from an ontology of flux --
itself, a fairly coherent category of value.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> This repudiation of fixed structure
and containment is also apparent in Olson's early rejection of
the Objectivist poetics of writers like Zukofsky, Reznikoff, and,
to some extent, Williams.  His critique of &quot;Objectivism&quot;
appears first in &quot;Projectivist Verse&quot; in a section that
attempts to isolate further some of the weaknesses in Pound's
cultural theory.  The very fact that Olson labels both Pound's
and Williams's writing as an &quot;objectivism&quot; comments
well on his limited exposure at that time to the 1930s aesthetic
movement.  Likely what he called &quot;objectivism&quot; depended
almost exclusively upon Zukofsky's short summary of his aesthetics
for <I>Poetry</I> magazine in 1931.  In February of that year,
at the instigation of Pound, Harriet Monroe formally contracted
Zukofsky to edit a special issue devoted to the work of such new
writers as George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, Charles Reznikoff, and Zukofsky
himself.  However limited Olson's exposure to these writers may
have been, it does not change the fact that in 1950 he felt it
necessary to respond to a very particular set of aesthetic issues,
generalised here under the heading of &quot;objectivism&quot;;
and this response, in itself, still establishes a useful dialogue
between his methodological interests and these earlier reformisms.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Immediately evident in comparing the
work of the Objectivists to the poetic theory of Olson, is a similar
concern for wide-scale revisionism.  For Olson, however, the unique
coherence of Objectivism, remained too dependent upon an abstract
notion of structure.  This quality is, in some ways, substantiated
by Zukofsky himself in the 1931 essay where, in no uncertain terms,
his methodology appears as a new formal system of organising human
knowledge.  The capabilities of the Objectivist poem were such
that they could provide what Zukofsky called a &quot;rested totality&quot;
within one's interpretative framework.  Zukofsky writes,<BR>
</FONT>
<blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  The need for standards in poetry is
no less than in science</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  ...Good verse is determined by the
poet's susceptibilities</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  involving a precise awareness of differences,
forms and</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  possibilities of existence - words
with their own attractions</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  included. The poet, no less than the
scientist, works on</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  the assumption that inert and live
things and relations</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  hold enough interest to keep him alive
as part of nature.</FONT>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">         (<I>Prepositions</I> 67)</FONT>
</blockquote>

<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">While Olson openly praised the complex,
yet structurally consistent principles behind Zukofsky's poetics,
few of its premises seemed to him to be particularly natural.
 Particularly disturbing to him, in fact, was the debt that Zukofsky's
aesthetics claimed to owe to the empiricism of conventional science.
 By Zukofsky's own admission within the 1931 text, little difference
existed between Objectivism's fidelity to poetic &quot;objectivity&quot;
and the technical notion of &quot;objective&quot; as defined by
the science of optics: &quot;A lens bringing the rays from an
object to a focus&quot; (<I>Prepositions</I> 12).  For Zukofsky,
the structures of verse operated in an analogous manner.  Thus,
in 1930 in a section of his long work <I>A</I>:</FONT>
<blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  My one voice. My other: is</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  An objective - rays of the object brought
to a focus,</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  An objective - nature as creator -
desire</FONT>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  for what is objectively perfect...</FONT>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">       (&quot;A-6&quot;)</FONT>
</blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">Zukofsky's language tended to emphasize
quite explicitly, then, the importance of technical form above
all other components in the generation of knowledge.  In his work,
the visible is directly reduced to the very conditions of visibility.
 More than just metaphors, Zukofsky's linguistic devices collectively
constituted an important set of instruments through which writing,
itself, was demythologised, i.e., purified as a medium of the
&quot;Real&quot;.  As Peter Cole writes, &quot;the language of
the Objectivist poem aims to recreate in us the sensation of the
poet's eye, ear, and mind moving along the contours of what is
being sensed or thought.  Literally the kinesthesia of this brought
into the language.&quot;  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Olson, for the most part, strongly accepted
this interpretation of language as a potential tool of disenchantment,
a new eye as lens, so to speak.  Both Pound's and Fenollosa's
earlier study of the pictograph had already impressed upon him
the importance of technical precision in aesthetics.  Laszlo G&eacute;fin,
in fact, formally groups such writings into a single genealogy
he calls the &quot;ideogrammic stream.&quot;  The use of the ideogramme
signals to G&eacute;fin more than a common imaging technique,
it implied a wider thematic search for an increasingly naturalised
discourse of the Real.  In Olson's own methodology, this search
is conducted by way of the syllable as an even more exact mediating
device.  That &quot;objectivisms&quot; continued to critique representational
forms of writing as overly biased and anthropomorphic further
testified, for Olson, to the earlier movement's past cultural
validity.  For both Olson and Zukofsky, the &quot;realness&quot;
of a poem's object or focus remained a function of disenchantment,
not the work's ability to reference some form of universal.  The
aesthetic principle operating here, in other words, is not a type
of mimesis; rather, Objectivist writing attempts to convey a more
immanent notion of the Real.  Poetry thus conceived does not record
reality so much as it attempts to re-enact it as an integral,
rational process.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Consistent with this logic, Zukofsky
considered his poems to be nothing less than natural structures,
&quot;keeping time with existence&quot; -- a perspective that
evokes as distinctive a paradigm of nature as it does a theory
of writing.  Hence, his use of formal devices implied no significant
detachment from human experience.  Zukofsky's sense of the Real
stressed its precise organisation as a coherent framework or composition.
 Reality, itself, in other words, remained commensurate with a
discourse of value.  Accordingly, as a poetics of disenchantment,
Zukofsy's writing literally encouraged objects to become objects;
reality defined itself as a reality.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> It is this characteristic of Objectivism
that Peter Quartermain further qualifies as a unique resolution
of aesthetics with social activism where &quot;the demand for
the poem to be political is a formal demand.&quot;  As Quartermain
suggests, to separate the two propositions  is to ignore one of
Objectivism's most salient features.  Properly read, each line,
perhaps even each individual word in a Zukofsky poem inherently
evokes wider moral themes.  Hence, when Zukofsky, himself, describes
his aesthetic methods, it is usually with reference to a work's
&quot;sincerity&quot; and linguistic &quot;integrity&quot;.  As
Michael Heller notes, Zukofsky's structural vision &quot;has about
it a moral burden: the Objectivist poet, meaning to inform, to
convey or translate to the reader the existence which he knows
through the media of objectification and sincerity, must resist
not only the aleatory, freewheeling associativeness of words but
also the usual decorative conceit of the symbol or image.&quot;
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Such a moral repudiation of the decorative
appears throughout G&eacute;fin's &quot;ideogrammic stream&quot;
of modernism.  Of Imagism, Pound declared in 1913, &quot;the natural
object is always the adequate symbol&quot; (<I>The Literary Essays
of Ezra Pound</I> 5).  Even in Olson, social reform properly conceived
proceeds directly from a naturalised paradigm of discourse.  In
all three movements of revisionary modernism, issues of public
morality remain effectively sublimated as themes of symbolic reform:
Proper signification in the ideogrammic vision equals proper government.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> As I've implied , this equilibrium is
even more evident in Olson's works than in the poetics of the
earlier two writers.  His keen promotion of a more kinetic or
gestural  aesthetics, in many ways, overtly exhibits what was
only hypothesised in the work of Pound and Zukofsky.  The tendency
in Zukofsky's early poetry, for example, for the conditions of
aesthetic reform to remain theoretically abstract implies that
the proper symbol itself is still very much an unfinished project,
still very much an object of desire.  One reads Zukofsky's science
of disenchantment, his &quot;ABC&quot; of objectivity, consequently,
as a set of principles not yet enacted.  By contrast, Olson's
projectivism declared a much less hypothetical sense of &quot;realness&quot;
as a formal quality.  In the later poet's vision, the nature of
the Real demanded an even more immanent, indwelling sense of structure,
one that automatically rejected all abstract speculation as evidence
of a false universal.  For this reason, Olson consistently refrained
from attaching any formal conditions to the objectivity of his
verse; a poem's legitimacy, instead, continued to derive from
an almost intuitive notion of the real particular.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Given its essentially innate authority,
projectivist verse required no explicit aesthetic theories with
which to counter either Pound's or Zukofsky's more doctrinal approach
to poetry.  In fact, if Olson's relationship to these earlier
attempts to construct a transparent epistemology of the Real can
be reduced to a single strategy it is that of reconciliation.
 Consistent with his antagonism to abstraction, Olson promises
no new symbolism in his poetics, but rather a recycling of older
ones by setting them in motion.  Under the aura of kinesis, one
glimpses, thus, not so much an alternate objectivity as a new
tolerance for objectivity as an inherently relative and pluralistic
mode of thinking.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Such an attitude of open compromise
translated, for many of Olson's contemporaries, into its own agenda
of political progressiveness and cultural emancipation.  Consequently,
with its pretense of natural immanence, projectivism comforms
well to wider trends in the American postwar political economy
and the shifts in consumer capitalism precipitated by it.  After
World War II, industrial production emphasized then as now a newly
de-objectified, de-centralised economic framework.  A more sophisticated,
reified network of consumer markets contributed to an increasingly
autonomous system of symbolic exchange, one in which the semantic
attribution of value is able to transcend most material contexts.
 One clear correspondence between the symbolic &quot;openness&quot;
or recyclability of projectivist verse and these newer economic
networks appears in the various ecological paradigms of social
development popularised during this period.  In the ecological
vision, important parallels quickly emerge between the particularity
of Olson's &quot;composition by field&quot; and America's postwar
management of its commercial resources, between the open text
and the open market.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> For Olson, a proprioceptive focus upon
phenomena extols not only a more relevant social agency, but a
naturally authentic human voice.  The sincerity, thus, with which
Zukofsky claimed to mediate his real environment is effectively
reiterated according to the very terms that he, himself, had set.
 However, what was for Zukofsky a highly theoretical, often politicised
struggle for total coherence becomes in Olson's hands an open
dialogue where criticism is replaced by feed-back, argument with
negotiation.  in Olson's vision there is, after all,</FONT>
<blockquote>
<font size=3><pre>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  not one death but many,</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  not accumulation but change, the feed-back proves,</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">                                                 the feed-back is</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">  the law</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">       (&quot;The Kingfishers&quot; 170)</FONT>
</blockquote>
</pre>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde">Once again, repudiating any notion of
fixed ideological position, the complex symbolic field associated
with proprioception emphasizes an aesthetics of constant movement
-- a logic of absorption by which all opposing cultural discourses
are successfully assimilated to form a new and improved symbolic
environment.   In the context of this landscape, there are no
rested totalities;  instead, writers engage in a cold war of constant
translation, an ongoing process of encoding and re-encoding. 
What specific objects might appear in such works continuously
fade in and out, change their shape from line to line, secure
in the knowledge that, since they cannot be located, their symbolic
integrity can never be challenged.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> A similar interest in symbolic integration
also appears in the ecological attitudes emerging at mid-century
in many different social disciplines, ranging from agricultural
production to political theory.  Common to each discourse is an
equally arbitrary sense of national, historical, and even cultural
contingencies.  The new mandate of the &quot;ecosystem&quot; transgresses
what conventional politics may be functioning at the time by repudiating
all positions of class-based hegemony.  As Karl Kroeber recently
writes, &quot;an ecosystem is a constantly self-transforming continuity.
No ecosystem exists outside of time or is adequately representable
as anything other than an encompassing ongoing process made up
of diversely intersecting subordinate temporal processes.&quot;
 Such an emphasis in criticism upon this new sense of immanent
social holism became increasingly prominent throughout the postwar
era, with Olson representing one of its earliest expressions.
 The ecosystem, it seemed, could adapt to almost any social context.
 Skeptical of all extreme narrations of political diversity, these
discourses considered no single position or specific activity
innately outside their logic.  No individual voice was exempted
from the possibility of dialogue.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> The ecological quality of a Black Mountain
aesthetics is most clearly evident in the work of editor and poet
Richard Grossinger.  In Grossinger's ecological readings of the
postwar landscape, a very explicit correlation between natural
process and modern social structure is revealed.  This is especially
palpable in Grossinger's etymological presentation of the very
word ecology.  Recalling the term's common linguistic root in
the Greek term <I>oikumene </I>meaning &quot;law of the house&quot;,
Grossinger spells ecology with a capital &quot;O&quot;.  For Grossinger,
a firmly integrated, and rationalised social system continues
to reflect larger, natural coherences.  All technologies, all
formal compositions are interpreted collectively as yet another
encoding of the Real.  As Grossinger comments, &quot;the house
has been built, and we've been living in it all these many years,
and we're long past the time of deciding whether it's beautiful
or functional. We've got to begin living in it.&quot;  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Similar to Olson, Grossinger offers
his readers a firmly integrated landscape, complete with its own
semiotics of the organism.  In his naturalised economy, yet another
language of the Real provides its subjects with an improved network
of communication.  The organic, microcosmic quality of this language
emerges in his work <I>Solar Journal</I>, in which Egyptian hieroglyphs
are able to interact with both astrological zodiacs and urban
traffic lights with very little loss in translation.  &quot;Every
motion,&quot; writes Grossinger, &quot;wind through trees, blue
warpaint on the forehead, taste of pig flesh is as real, is universal.&quot;
 Such are the terms of consensus described by Grossinger, and
implicit in all ecologies.  Absorbing what traces of ideological
distance were evident in the &quot;objectivisms&quot; of the interwar
period, these later cosmologies, Olson included, do seem to reflect
a more essentialised cultural logic.  Grossinger's flirtation
with linguistic consciousness might be situated, thus, within
a larger political and moral idealism germane to the postwar American
cultural order and its corresponding symbolic coherence.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> Yet, as in both Stencil's quest for
the mythical &quot;V.&quot;, and Olson's search for real &quot;Kingfishers&quot;,
it is useless to seek in Grossinger's oecological journal any
single synoptic key or legend that might formally reveal the inherent
connection between &quot;the taste of pig flesh&quot; and &quot;wind
through trees&quot;.  To do so would tend to re-emphasize what
objective differences remain between the two phenomena, and, thus,
violate the inherent integrity that binds that particular oecological
community.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Avant Garde"> In Grossinger's discursive universe,
symbolic dissent is considered not so much intolerable as impossible
-- at least in theory.  No interpretative guideline exists save
for a simple choice between full compliance and complete withdrawal.
 The debate over which rooms of this particular cultural &quot;house&quot;
are more relevant than others has long since become obsolete.
 At best such critiques run the risk of appearing inauthentic
and insincere, at worst completely unnatural, punishable by their
quick removal from the entire system.  In the mythological postwar
state, there are no wrong questions.  Gaps in the symbolic order,
far from indicating a relentless desire for some lost object of
value, tend to signify instead necessary phases of cultural re-invention,
moments in which one's search for meaning in the postwar symbolic
landscape confronts yet another new disguise.</FONT>
