<b>Provocations</b> by Ray DiPalma
<p>
Provocations, a major new book by Ray DiPalma.
Apart from various limited editions recently
published in the United States and abroad, 
Provocations is DiPalma's first full-length
collection of new work in almost six years.
Resisting easy clasification but continuing
his unique examination of the relationship
between language and thought, the instinctive
lyricism, formal range, and speclulative 
complexities present in Provocations reveal
DiPalma's writing at its most animated and
accessible.<br>

<b>Locale</b> by Jessica Grim
<p>
"Reading and rereading this extraordinary manuscript,
I find myself asking where these poems most completely
come alive: word, line or 'sentence'?  The truth is
I can't tell--the poems leap off the page at all
levels, as if Jessica Grim has tapped into the secret
of a fourth dimension.  Playful, serious, intense and
wise all at once, with an accurate eye and an absolute
ear, Locale contains some of the most riveting poems of
our time.  The art of the 21st Century starts here."<br>
