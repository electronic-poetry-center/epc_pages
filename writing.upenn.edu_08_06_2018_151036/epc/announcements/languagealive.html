Sound & Language announce the publication of the first of a series of 5
books given over to presenting
<blockquote>
               writing for Live action<br>
               or developed through Live action<br>
               or directly related to Live action.<br>
</blockquote>

<font size=5><b>Language aLive</b><font size=4> presents the materials themselves, unmediated by critical
discourse or academic frameworks. Language aLive is a Primary Resource for
writing and performance. Its focus is purposefully on Language and on ways
in which inter-disciplinary artists are transforming language through their
attentions.

<p>

The first issue (88pp plus full colour wraparound cover) features:
<blockquote>
-    Fiona Templeton ('Titova Balcony Speech' & 'King Verdict')<br>
<br>
-    Forced Entertainment ('Speak Bitterness')<Br>
<br>
-    Fiona Wright ('Jonah Touching Jonah' documents)<br>
</blockquote>
Forthcoming issues (two and three will appear in February / March '96) will
include work by:<blockquote>
 Brian Catling  /  Man Act  /  Caroline Bergvall / Aaron
Williamson & Tertia Longmire / Gary Stevens / Carla Harryman / Steve Benson
/ Robert Overson / Kip Fulbeck / Donna Rutherford / Eric Belgum</blockquote>

'Many of those being published by Language aLive clamber deliberately in
the hybrid cracks between conventional categories such as drama,
literature, music and dance.
<p>

The syntax in these books won't necessarily re-present vernacular speech,
nor conform to conventional sentence formations.These writings often have
more in common, in terms of how their language materials are processed,
with movement or sound-based compositions, with film and video editing
techniques, with technological modes of production, with interventions into
architextural space.
<br>
In each case they do not tell their whole story.
