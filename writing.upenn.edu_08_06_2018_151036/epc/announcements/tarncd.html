 We (<font size=5>Spoken Engine<font size=4>) have just released our second CD,
Nathaniel Tarn's, <b>I Think This May Be Eden</b>, with music composed by Billy 
Panda.<p>
The selections cover most of Tarn's career -- from <b>The Beautiful
Contradictions,  Lyrics For The Bride Of God</b> (including a stunning rendition
of "Section: America (2): Seen As A Bird"), <b>Seeing America First</b>,and four
sections of <b>Architextures</b>.
<p>
This CD, as well as Nathaniel Mackey's, <b>Strick</b>, is available for $14
(postage paid) from<blockquote> <b>Spoken Engine</b><br> P.O. Box 771739<br> Memphis, TN 38177-1739<br><br> or
through Small Press Distribution.</blockquote>
<p>
And we are working on a CD with Maxine Hong Kingston. We've been trying to get
her to change her name to Nathaniel Hong Kingston for continuity's sake, but
she seems resistant for some reason.
