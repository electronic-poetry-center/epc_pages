     "`Are <b>herisson</b>--<b>herissons</b> messengers like eagles?'
`Like what, Rose-of-the-Alps?'  `Are <b>herissons</b>, I mean, mixed
up like eagles with stories out of Greek books?'  Now Doctor
Berne Blum was an odd sort of person.  Most people laughed when
you asked them questions . . . or said, `Little girls shouldn't
ask such things' . . . or pretended not to have heard, and talked
about something else or just went out and whispered (rather
loudly) behind closed doors, `Now what does one tell a child
about such matters?'  Doctor Berne Blum wasn't like any of these
people.  He said:  `Little Rose-of-the-Alps, that is a most
important question.'"<br>
