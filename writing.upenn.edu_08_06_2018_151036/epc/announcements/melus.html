<b>First International and Eleventh National MELUS Conference</b>

Multi-Ethnic Literatures Across the Americas and the Pacific:
Exchanges, Contestations, and Alliances
<p>
The University of Hawai'i at Manoa * April 18-20, 1997
Hosted by the College of Languages, Linguistics, and Literature;

and the Department of Ethnic Studies
<p>
The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United
States (MELUS) will hold its first international conference at the
University of Hawai'i in 1997, in acknowledgement of both Hawaii's
central location between East and West and the increasingly complex
relationship between the Pacific and the Americas. We invite proposals
for papers, panels, etc. (less than 500 words). In addition to papers on
the multi-ethnic literatures of North America, we welcome comparative
perspectives that address  the growing cultural or textual  connections
between America and the  Pacific, as well as comparative  perspectives
on  postcolonial  and  American  ethnic  literatures.
