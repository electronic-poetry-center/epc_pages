<b>RUNE HUNTER</b> will be an electronic poetry journal published by me
and appearing on an irregular basis.  Its purpose is to deliver the
highest quality poetry available to the widest possible audience
through the use of the Internet with the aim to reintroduce the
general public to what poetry is, who writes it, and its power to
make ordinary lives extraordinary.
<p>
Preference will be given to shorter, lyric poetry of power and
insight, but excellence is the first criterion for publication.
Submissions should be e-mailed to hunter@mik.uky.edu in ascii,
unencoded and uncompressed.  Snail-mail submissions may be sent to
Philip Brashear, 3771 Camelot Drive #253, Lexington KY  40517.
Payment will be in copies only.<b> RUNE HUNTER</b> claims only first North
American serial rights, but requests that future appearances of a
work acknowledge its initial appearance in<b> RUNE HUNTER</b>.
Simultaneous submissions are accepted, but previously published
work is not.
<p>
Subscriptions are available free upon request, and sample copies
will be provided free as well as soon as they exist.<br>
This is a new publication, so it will be some time before the first
issue appears.  Keep this in mind when submitting your work.  I
anticipate a response time of no more than a week or two, but this
may vary widely depending on such factors as my school
responsibilities, my son's health, etc.
<p>

Questions may be directed to hunter@mik.uky.edu or to me at
(606)273-7557.
