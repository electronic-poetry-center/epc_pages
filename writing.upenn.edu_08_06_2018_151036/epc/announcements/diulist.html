		  <b> THESES FOR A **NEO-LUDDITE UNION-MILITIA<br>
		         SECOND INSTALLMENT</b><br>
		         (a food disaster or, we've got those BHT Blues)
<blockquote>
		"We see of what important ethical significance<br>
		the doctrine of food has for the people. What<br>
		is eaten turns to blood, the blood to heart<br>
		and brain, to the stuff of thought and<br>
		temperament. Human fare is the foundation of<br>
		human culture and disposition. Do you want to<br>
		improve the people? Then instead of preaching<br>
		against sin, give them better food. Man is<br>
		what he/she eats."<br>
		                <blockquote>  --Feuerbach <b>Selected Works,<br>

<blockquote>			"A revolution is not a dinner party, or<br>
			writing an essay, or painting a picture, or<br>
			doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so<br>
			leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind,<br>
			courteous, restrained, and magnanimous."<br>

<blockquote>
	No, the cantaloupes are not the kinder and<br>
	gentler fruit they used to be, are they?  Just<br>
	a few years ago, it seemed our humble melon<br>
	tasted like fruit should taste: somewhat<br>
	sweet, not too sweet, had an actual flavor<br>
	that we could recognize as resembling fruit,<br>
	it had a good, firm texture and the color was<br>
	as an artist's rendering of the shade of<br>
	"cantaloupe." Now, we bite into a cardboard<br>
	cantaloupe--perhaps, not so with the<br>
	independent fruit stand variety--however, in<br>
	many cold climes this opportunity is limited<br>
	to a few fruit growing months. Yet, what of<br>
	those other climates that supply the Nation<br>
	with this fruit year-round?  Well, we feel it<br>
	just doesn't taste the same.  When we begin to<br>
	see signs in our semi-favorite sub-shops that<br>
	read "please excuse our lack of lettuce--there<br>
	were floods (or desertifications) in<br>
	California or Guatemala," will we unwittingly<br>
	excuse and then, excuse again?  How many<br>
	excuses will it take for the  grammatical<br>
	Nation to realize that we reside within a<br>
	dying ecosystem, disconnected and seriously<br>
	fraught with imbalance?  We will not be able<br>
	to attend these fast-food complexes of our<br>
	pollution-filled dreams, chomping these two-<br>
	foot sandwiches when we come to these<br>
	realizations--sans ou avec lettuce.**(We<br>
	believe that citizens of hate-language<br>
	national entities should cease stuffing those<br>
	caged cows, piggies, and en masse-produced<br>
	fowl into their mouths because this earth<br>
	cannot support the amount of energy,land and<br>
	resources it requires to fortify the thousands<br>
	of _partial-food_ franchises w/such beasts of<br>
	the field and forest).<br>
	And the shrimp estuaries have been<br>
	disconnected, as well.  Look back to your<br>
	first shrimp cocktail with its piquant red<br>
	sauce for dipping:  it did taste somewhat<br>
	sweet (like the fruit?), had a nice plump,<br>
	pinkish, shrimp texture. This first-cocktail<br>
	of yours felt, smelt and tasted like something<br>
	from the sea, albeit, a fresh and sweet sea, a<br>
	fresh salt pond.  Now, in 1995, we buy our<br>
	shrimp in groceries or "special" fish markets<br>
	(we think will make it fresher) and it is as<br>
	if we were eating cardboard, again, like that<br>
	gentle cantaloupe. The 1995 variety of shrimp<br>
	has an off-color smell, it smells as if<br>
	domestic violence has entered its home. We are<br>
	able to detect this problem within the walls<br>
	of the shrimp farm even though these wee<br>
	crustaceae have travelled thousands of miles<br>
	to reach our plates.  We read, that, in<br>
	Louisiana, many shrimp beds are diseased and<br>
	hence, we realize a vital link within the<br>
	ocean environment has been severed. We also<br>
	read, that in Ecuador, our little pink friends<br>
	are being harvested in "shrimp tanks" within<br>
	the mangrove swamps. These "ecologically<br>
	sensitive" swamps are being destroyed because<br>
	of the tank farming. So far, twenty percent of<br>
	the mangrove swamp has been completely<br>
	destroyed and eighty percent, spoiled. We<br>
	could agree with the Ecological Action folks<br>
	by boycotting shrimp exports from Ecuador and<br>
	Louisiana, but is it enough to focus solely on<br>
	the capital aspect of preserving the shrimp<br>
	ecology? Is the way to a better-environment's<br>
	heart through its pocket book? We, at the<br>
	union-militia, feel differently (but are<br>
	certainly not adverse to beginning with<br>
	boycott), because it harkens back to the<br>
	presence or not-presence of necrotized hate-<br>
	language constructions. Because the pocket-<br>
	book method is a continuation of a grammar<br>
	wielding axes and pitchforks--seemingly<br>
	effective, but remaining simply, chimeraic.<br>
	We see the ruse as being affected through the<br>
	positive-ruse;  fighting chimera with shadow.<br>
	Presence with alter-presence. Food is a<br>
	presence that could be contended with or<br>
	_bannerized_; food as a _presence_ that<br>
	furthers a positive-neo-luddite awareness. It<br>
	is a shadowy weapon on the stormfront of<br>
	disease. It does not need to be necrotized or<br>
	eroticized (although, erotic food could be<br>
	valuable in this engagement), but can be<br>
	whole, disease-free, taste like it "used to,"<br>
	fortify the minds of a previous _nevermind_<br>
	(Neverland?) generation(s).<br>
	 **General disclaimer**: we, at the union-<br>
	militia realize that the above verbosity and<br>
	demi-socially-ameliorative ramblings are not<br>
	all-inclusive of the many, many hate-language<br>
	issues. It is therefore suggested that the<br>
	reader find paths of investigation to<br>
	_further_ his/her understanding of the many<br>
	ecological catastrophes and the potential<br>
	solutions to these--remembering that this is<br>
	not a _war_ against sin, or the current<br>
	political/world/national situation, but must<br>
	be revolutionary w/some common health and<br>
	nutritional goals in mind. Afterall, life is<br>
	not a _dinner party_.<br>
