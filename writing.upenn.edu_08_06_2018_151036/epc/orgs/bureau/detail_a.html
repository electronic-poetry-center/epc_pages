<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Detailed Description</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the early eighties, it was nearly impossible for French poets and readers to find out what was being written on the other side of the Atlantic by their contemporary American counterparts, and the work in translation that did reach them did so with a delay of one or even two generations.</P>

<P>Over the course of the decade, <A HREF="EH_a.html">Emmanuel Hocquard</A> set about reducing this generational delay by:</P>

<UL>
<LI>inviting to France contemporary American poets not yet known or translated there;</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>regular programming of collective translation seminars at the <I>Centre de Po&eacute;sie &amp; Traduction</I> at <a href="http://www.royaumont.com/">Fondation Royaumont</A>, just outside of Paris;</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>organizing readings by American in Paris (mainly at the <I>Mus&eacute;e d'Art moderne de la ville de Paris</I>) and elsewhere in France (Bordeaux, Saint-Nazaire, Dijon, Marseille, etc.) (<a HREF= "ur-invites_a.html">list of invited poets until 1989</a>);</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>publishing translations in magazines (notably <I>Action Po&eacute;tique), </I>in book form (<A HREF="collRoyaumont_f.html">Les Cahiers de Royaumont</A>), and in an anthology selected by Emmanuel Hocquard and Claude Royet-Journoud in 1981<I>(</I><a HREF= "21+1_f.html">21+1 po&egrave;tes am&eacute;ricains d'aujourd'hui</a> with a corresponding English volume, <a HREF= "21+1_a.html">21+1 American Poets Today</A><I>, </I>simultaneously published by Claude Richard's Delta Press at the Universit&eacute; de Montpellier in 1986).</LI></UL>

<I>
</I><P>In 1989, with the support of the Centre National du Livre and the <I>Centre de Po&eacute;sie &amp; Traduction</I> at Fondation Royaumont, Emmanuel Hocquard founded a non-profit association called <B>Un bureau sur l'Atlantique</B> which, building on the work already accomplished, would continue to advance the knowledge of American poetry in French.  </P>

<P>The <I>Bureau</I>'s first act was to publish a second anthology of American poets, again chosen by Emmanuel Hocquard and Claude Royet-Journoud, <a HREF= "49+1_a.html">49+1 nouveaux po&egrave;tes am&eacute;ricains</a> published by &Eacute;ditions Royaumont.</P>

<I><P>&#9;</I>Since 1989, <B>Un bureau sur l'Atlantique</B> has edited a series of books, published with &Eacute;ditions Cr&eacute;aphis, by contemporary American poets in translation, focusing primarily on texts translated through Royaumont's collective translation seminars (<a HREF= "collbsa_a.html">list of books published since 1989</a>).  </P>
<I>
</I><P>&#9;The <I>Bureau </I>continues to program readings at Royaumont, Paris, and elsewhere in France. (<A HREF="manifs_a.html">American Poets Invited to France by <I>Un bureau sur l'Atlantique</I> &amp; Other Events</A>).</P>

<P>In 1993, with the support of Fondation Royaumont and that of association members, Un bureau sur l'Atlantique expanded by adding a new series called <B>Format Am&eacute;ricain</B>, created and run by Juliette Val&eacute;ry.   Format Am&eacute;ricain also publishes new translations of American poetry, but in a small format, chapbook series photocopied and available to the association members by subscription.  Since it began, Format Am&eacute;ricain has published 26 chapbooks, which, when taken as a whole represents an &quot;in progress&quot; anthology of more than 500 pages (<a HREF= "coll-fa_a.html">Format Am&eacute;ricain</a> + <a HREF= "LeGam_a.html">Le «Gam»</a>).</P>

<P>&#9;Initiated by the Bureau, the computer inventory of all the translations of contemporary American poetry in French since 1945 began in 1993 at the <I>&Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure</I> in Fontenay-aux-Roses. This work continues, directed by Marc Ch&eacute;netier. The inventory now contains more than 3000 entries; a CD-rom edition and a web-accessible version are now under consideration.</P><B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
