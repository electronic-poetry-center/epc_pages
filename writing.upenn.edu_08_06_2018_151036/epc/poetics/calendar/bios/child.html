<p><b>WRITERS MAKING FILM: ABIGAIL CHILD<br>

  Film Screening: <i>Covert Action, Mayhem, Mercy, Ornamentals, Dark Dark<br>
  </i></b><br>
  Abigail Child makes experimental films that exist just within the comprehensible 
  wild. Distinguished by their frenetic montage of original and archival images 
  and use of sound as a concrete rather than complementary element, her films 
  enable the viewer a temporary home in the unknown&#151;soliciting participation 
  by the call of adventure and not by the dare of competition. The program&#146;s 
  titles <i>Covert Action</i> (1984), <i>Mayhem</i> (1987), and <i>Mercy</i> (1989) 
  are from <i>Is This What You Were Born For?</i>, a series intended &#147;to 
  bracket ongoing film investigations in the context of the aggressions of the 
  late Twentieth Century&#148; and named after a Goya etching. The earlier work 
  <i>Ornamentals</i> (1979) exemplifies the filmmaker&#146;s commitment to &#147;rhythm, 
  the rhythm of body-nerve-mind&#148; whereas <i>Dark Dark</i> (2001), (read a 
  review of Child's <i>B/Side</i> in <a href="http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/32/abigailchild.html">Bright 
  Lights Journal</a>. Child&#146;s newest film, further investigates narrative 
  construction and decomposition by interlacing four found story fragments: film 
  noir, western, romance, and pursuit. Films are 16mm, feature the music of Ennio 
  Morricone, Zeena Parkins and Christian Marclay, and run about 70 minutes total.
