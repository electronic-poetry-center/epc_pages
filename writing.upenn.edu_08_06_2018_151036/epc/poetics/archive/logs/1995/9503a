Subject: not humorous, but important
 
Hi.
 
This is not a normal artymarty mailing.  I apologize for this email's
non-humor nature, but it contains information that, in my opinion,
needs to be disseminated as quickly as possible.  I apologize for the
length, but it's really that important, so please read it all!  This
is something that affects us all!
 
Currently 13,748 people have signed the petition to stop Senate Bill
S. 314.  We need more!  Add your voice, it'll only take a minute.
 
**********Forwarded material********
 
Simply put, a couple of senators have proposed a particularly heinous
piece of legislation titled the "Communications Decency Act of 1995"
(Senate Bill S. 314).  Basically, the bill would subject all forms of
electronic communication -- from public Internet postings to your most
private email -- to government censorship.  The effects of the bill
onto the online industry would be devastating -- most colleges and
private companies (AOL, Compuserve, etc.) would probably have to shut
down or greatly restrict access, since they would be held criminally
liable for the postings and email of private users.
 
[for more information, see the www page: http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/ ]
 
The bill would compel service providers to choose between severely
restricting the activities of their subscribers or completely shutting
down their email, Internet access, and conferencing services under the
threat of criminal liability. Moreover, service providers would be
forced to closely monitor every private communication, electronic mail
message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or
available on their network, a proposition which poses a substantial
threat to the freedom of speech and privacy rights of all American
citizens.
 
Obviously, this bill is designed to win votes for these senators among
those who are fearful of the internet and aren't big fans of freedom
of speech -- ie., those who are always trying to censor "pornography"
and dirty books and such.  Given the political climate in this
country, this bill might just pass unless the computer community
demonstrates its strength as a committed political force to be
reckoned with.  This, my friends, is why I have filled your mailbox
with this very long message.
 
A petition, to be sent to Congress, the President, and the media, has
begun spreading through the Internet.  It's easy to participate and be
heard -- to sign it, you simply follow the instructions below -- which
boil down to sending a quick email message to a certain address.
That's all it takes to let your voice be heard.
 
Finally, PLEASE forward this message to all of your friends online.
The more people who sign the petition, the more the government will
get the message to back off the online community.  We've been doing
fine without censorship until now -- let's show them we don't plan on
allowing them to start now.  If you value your freedoms -- from your
right to publicly post a message on a worldwide forum to your right to
receive private email without the government censoring it -- you need
to take action NOW.  It'll take two minutes at the most, a small
sacrifice considering the issues at hand.  Remember, the age of
fighting for liberty with muskets and shells is most likely over; the
time has come where the keyboard and the phone line will prove
mightier than the sword -- or the Senate, in this case.
 
--
 
 Here's what you have to do to sign the petition:
 
 send an e-mail message to:  S314-petition@netcom.com
 the message (NOT the subject heading) should read as follows:
 SIGNED <your online address> <your full name> <U.S. Citizen (y/n)>
 eg.  SIGNED mreames@cs.wisc.edu  Martin Reames  YES
 
 If you are interested in signing the petition, I would highly suggest
 investigating the details of the situation.  You can find out more on
 the Web at    http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/

Having achieved the second level of funnel, the AHP
is no longer accessible to us even through back channels.
Employing a secret identity removal process, they jacked
into the net some time ago.  Mind you, they are not merely
the binary replicating viruses that the humans call graffiti.
They pinned the access server on the underside of the complex plane.
Their consciousness has become vast.  They are the AIs one encounters
called Runt Packet, Multiple Ack, and Broadcast Storm.  Yet naming
them doesnUt help and they continue to worry us.  But shouldnUt we
be glad that the vast and fluid AIs think our group worthy of comment?
They actually wish us well and want us to join them in the second
level of funnel.  The second level is achieved by realizing that
identity is only unnatural.  Now become the person in everyoneUs life.

Could we please get the list back into a bit of order?  I don't see any
reason to bash Ron Silliman's or anybody else's character or work.  I regret
having made any comment to the effect that we shouldn't keep some restraint
in dealing with this list.
 
This should be an e-space where people can safely and responsibly discuss
poetry matters with one-up-manship kept to a minimum.  Another place where a
real sense of community can continue.  Otherwise, it seems it will degenerate
into something that most people will not be interested in dealing with.

Dear Charles, Chris, Sheila, Spencer & others:
 
I share Spencer's concerns, if not his negativity (which I appreciate
nonetheless). Here: Minneapolis-St. Paul, there's the MONOLITH (The Loft,
New Rivers, Graywolf, Holy Cow!, Milkweed, New Rivers, Coffee House
Press) and then there's "everyone else." "Everyone else" does not
constitute a community, and may never, though we might be better off if
it did. What we have (partial list, and forgive how reductive this will be):
        Charles Alexander (Chax Press, and Exec. Dir. of the MN Center
for Book Arts): Charles publishes and brings to MPLS-STPL mostly mid- or
advanced-career poets, writers and bookmakers. His primary (which
is not to say "only") "influence sphere" seems to be the language writers.
        Curt Anderson (_Exile_): Curt's interests are mostly classical; I
couldn't tell you what his contemporary "influence sphere(s)" might be.
        Erik Belgum (starting up a cassette label which will "publish"
sound/text pieces): Erik's "influence sphere" seems to be sound/text
artists, mostly Canadians, such as The Four Horsemen.
        Jonathan Brannen (Standing Stones Press): Jonathan's primary
"influence spheres" seem to be the "inland experimentalists" (U.S. &
Canadian) and "exploratory" fiction writers past & present.
        Marta Deike (Detour Press): Marta's primary "I.S." seems to be
innovative/feminist writers, such as Sarah Murphy, Kathy Acker, etc.
        Eliza Murphy (no vehicle): Eliza's "I.S." seems (based on reading
very little of her work) to be early American and British women
modernists, like Mina Loy.
        Mark Nowak (_furnitures_, North American Ideophonics): Mark's
primary "I.S." seems to be a combination of sound/text artists and poets
associated with ethno/spoken-poetics.
        Anthony Schlagel (no vehicle): Couldn't say what his "I.S." might
be, though I think it's mostly classical and international.
        Gary Sullivan (Detour Press): My primary "I.S" would be the NY
School and the unaffiliated/disenfranchised (Burns, Thorpe, Weiners).
 
There are others here, too. How do we all get together, despite our
different interests? Might not our getting together and discovering
common ground, as well as making discoveries through each other, be more
valuable to us ultimately than if we remain fully devoted to our own
special interests?
 
This, I think, is the crux of Spencer's argument. He seems to be
suggesting a dialog as opposed to a number of (admittedly interesting)
monologues. We're all interested in "open form" poetry, no? How about
"open community"? Is that possible? Ed Foster's _Talisman_ seems to me
one of the most successful attempts at creating, if not an "open
community," the next best thing, a fairly open magazine, "meeting place."
 
I'd like to see that happen here in Minnesota. Any ideas?
 
Yours,
 
Gary

Hear hear (or is it here, here?) to Bob Harrison's response to the recent slew
of postings. I don't exactly object to what Bob calls the Silliman-bashing,
but only because I'm not sure it's bashing--though I'm the one who can't read
tone, remember, so Ron, you might feel differently. Are you being bashed? What
I do object to is the sudden upsurge in the bullshit quotient. Can we at least
consider an "In-Jokes and General Cutesiness" sub-list, to accommodate the
folks who have all this free time on their hands to be anti-hegemonic or who
want to continue the apparently endless flavors-of-New-Zealand-ice-cream
thread?
 
Frankly I'm getting just about ready to check out and head on over to the New

Dyspeptically your-all's,

Subject:      in-jokes, flames
 
Susan, as someone who very much appreciates in-jokes, I hate to say this,
but I agree with you; at least, when confronted with a barrage (12, I
think) of them all at once. I thought the first "Ron" flame was funny,
the second less so, and I just began deleting the things without reading
'em by the 4th or 5th. As Gerald Burns once cautioned me (I quote from
memory): "You'll never learn anything until you realize that the quality
of light in a room is the same thing as the life of the mind, or the
soul." (He put it more eloquently than that.) As someone who reads &
writes a lot of satire, I've always been aware of the inherent paradox:
You may hit the object dead on, but the subject is always, ultimately,
you. In the best (most "effective") satire, your audience is almost
unaware of your presence, all attention being focused on the object. In
cases of overkill (like the recent 12-part "Ron" flames), you're not only
more aware of the author than you should be, you begin to sympathize with
the object(s) of his/her satirical/parodic communication.
 
I don't want people to cease posting satire & parody: it's a perfectly
valid (& sometimes efficient) means of getting across ideas & concerns.
But be careful not to alienate what audience you do have.
 
Thanks,
 
Gary

It appears that this list needs, not wants, a coherant amount of prattle.
That the theory/truth dichotomy is not a dichotomy at all, but a revolving
door that lets the social, the riff-raff in. It seems this need strikes at
the heart (a prattlish metaphor) of the hinge that lets in and issues out.
The thin membrane between theory and doctrine needs prattle in order to
decipher, or to clarify that oscillation between love and chattle,
acquaintance and stranger. I hate to appear to substantiate incoherent
subtrafuge because in fact what I wish to lend credence to is coherent
subtrafuge and applaud all those who relish (and undermine) the berm.

I thought I might offer that I once climbed three stories above the street
at Shattuck and University in Berkeley to "alter" a billboard above
McDonald's. The billboard was advertising an Egg McMuffin and the caption
was "Rise and Dine." After several Irish coffees at Brennan's (a local
wursthouse cum irish pub with vietnamese cooks) a co-conspirator and I
climbed the narrow ladder, he watched for cops and I spray painted "Wretch
and Die" to my delight and we scurried down. (This kind of think can get
you killed by vigilante's in LA.) It wasn't until a year or two later that
a publication on "altered billboards" and general mayhem in the Bay Area
came out that I realized that my double entendre was in fact a mis-spelling
- much like subtrafuge.

Strange, I am really glad to hear a bit of humour from time to time,
and really glad to read the fake newspaper stuff from, I think,
Albany. Before they showed up I was struck by the earnestness, the
humorlessness of most of the talk, the (pardon me) self-imp[ortance.
I was thinking: is this a U.S. characteristic of the poetry crowd

I want to endorse Sullivan's recent plea for openness, for dialogue
as opposed to monologs bashing each other. How many times have you
had to go to some "function" and talk with a poet whose work you have
always felt like denigrating, and found out that she was really fun
to talk with, maybe even shared some feelings about things? You dont
then have to like the person's poetryt, but you can still have
commerce with that person, and really, is that worthless, a person? I
really LIKE the Ny school poets, but that doesnt mean I am going to
bang monologue up against a LangPo guy who canyt stand, say, Ron
Padgett. Sorry if this sounds skewed: I have just come bacj from
reading at a Freedom To Read Week "function" with some "other" types
whom I enkoyed hearing.

I'm surprised at the criticism directed at the Silliman flames. Well, not
surprised. I agree that a lot of it is a waste of time to read, that a lot
of the humorous listings here are a waste of time, but that's why we have
delete mechanisms. But it also seems to me that this bullshit is a sign of
a healthy discussion group as well--a bit of useless material, and there's
a lot to be said about the usefulness of uselessness. Too, a lot of it
seems not only tongue in cheek, but a tongue in a tongue in cheek. And do
we kid ourselves that all of the "serious" material is really valuable? I
do agree that the jokes are growing tired, or rather, I'm growing tired of
them, even if they do show signs that poetry is alive, that it's being
taken out of "serious" discussions and being bandied about. Let this group
breath and stretch and scratch, produce overflow, useless, excretory
overflow.

Gary,
 
Any ideas for forming an "open community" here in Minnesota?  For a start,
you might discuss this idea with those people you list in your post.  They actually live in
Minnesota which seems relevant since you've chosen to define community as locale (not a
concept that I feel entirely at home with).  If you find this is too radical a notion, I'm sure
Charles (Hi, to all three Charles! on this list), Chris (Hi, Chris! all four of you), Sheila (Hi,
Sheila!), Spencer (Hi, Spencer!) and others (Hi, others! each of you, individuals that you are
with, I hope, varied life-styles) could all provide wonderful ideas for "open communities" in
Minnesota.  Why not have a contest?
 
Why not have everyone SEND PROPOSALS FOR ***OPEN COMMUNITIES IN
MINNESOTA*** TO GARY SULLIVAN, GPSJ@PRIMENET.COM!  Maybe, the winner
could be chosen randomly in a blind reading by the members of the Minnesota Project for
Contemporary Language Arts (Hi again, Gary! Hi, Marta! Hi, Curt! oops, you're not on-line
are you Curt?) and announced in a future issue of EXILE (Hi, Minnesota Project for
Contemporary Language Arts!).  How about a selection of miscellaneous e.g. Press chapbooks
as the prize?
 
I, too, admire what Ed Foster is doing with TALISMAN.  I attribute this to his editorial
intelligence and his willingness to be open to various poetries rather than being governed by one
narrow agenda of poetics.
 
I don't know what "inland experimentalists" are.  But if it's among my "influence spheres" then
it includes all the continents, not simply North America and it's not landlocked, though it's not
an imaginary coast.  I grew up on the coast of Florida, I understand the difference between
passing waves and solid ground.  As for Standing Stones Press, I publish chapbooks of work that
I like, both poetry and fiction.  The writers I've published live all over approach writing in
various ways.  They include Geof Huth, Sheila Murphy, Dennis Barone, Curt Anderson,
Stephen-Paul Martin, Michelle Murphy, Peter Ganick, Cydney Chadwick and John Perlman.
Titles by Gerald Burns and Tom Ahern are in the works.  I'll be posting a catalog to the list in
the near future.
 
Gary, I'm not sure which of Spencer's many well-stated arguments you're rallying in support
of.  If it's his notion that poetry is an art and that there is a discernable difference between art
and theory, I agree.  I also believe that poems can be the manifestations of theory and that
poems can contain theories or anything else that finds its way into the work.  Did I miss a
posting from Spencer concerning the nature of dialog?  The trick to successful dialog is to pay
attention to one another's monologues rather than simply speaking to hear the sound of your on
voice.  Don't put words in my mouth and I'll listen while you speak.
 
Best of all to all,
Jonathan

This, I think, is the crux of Spencer's argument. He seems to be

"open community"? Is that possible? Ed Foster's _Talisman_ seems to me
one of the most successful attempts at creating, if not an "open

Sorry I mangled the line breaks last time.  Hope this

Gary,
 
Any ideas for forming an "open community" here in
Minnesota?  For a start, ou might discuss this idea
with those people you list in your post.  They actually
live in Minnesota which seems relevant since you've
chosen to define community as locale (not a concept
that I feel entirely at home with).  If you find this
is too radical a notion, I'm sure Charles (Hi, to all
three Charles! on this list), Chris (Hi, Chris! all
four of you), Sheila (Hi, Sheila!), Spencer (Hi, Spencer!)
and others (Hi, others! each of you, individuals that
you are with, I hope, varied life-styles) could all
provide wonderful ideas for "open communities" in
Minnesota.  Why not have a contest?
 
Why not have everyone
SEND PROPOSALS FOR ***OPEN COMMUNITIES IN MINNESOTA***
TO GARY SULLIVAN, GPSJ@PRIMENET.COM!
 
Maybe, the winner could be chosen randomly in a blind
reading by the members of the Minnesota Project for
Contemporary Language Arts (Hi again, Gary! Hi, Marta!
Hi, Curt! oops, you're not on-line are you Curt?) and
announced in a future issue of EXILE (Hi, Minnesota
Project for Contemporary Language Arts!).  How about
a selection of miscellaneous e.g. Press chapbooks
as the prize?
 
I, too, admire what Ed Foster is doing with TALISMAN.
I attribute this to his editorial intelligence and
his willingness to be open to various poetries rather
than being governed by one narrow agenda of poetics.
 
I don't know what "inland experimentalists" are.  But if
it's among my "influence spheres" then it includes all
the continents, not simply North America and it's not
landlocked, though it's not an imaginary coast.  I grew
up on the coast of Florida, I understand the difference
between passing waves and solid ground.  As for
Standing Stones Press, I publish chapbooks of work that
I like, both poetry and fiction.  The writers I've published
live all over approach writing in various ways.  They include
Geof Huth, Sheila Murphy, Dennis Barone, Curt Anderson,
Stephen-Paul Martin, Michelle Murphy, Peter Ganick,
Cydney Chadwick and John Perlman.  Titles by Gerald Burns
and Tom Ahern are in the works.  I'll be posting a
catalog to the list in the near future.
 
Gary, I'm not sure which of Spencer's many
well-stated arguments you're rallying in
support of.  If it's his notion that poetry is an
art and that there is a discernable difference
between art and theory, I agree.  I also believe that
poems can be the manifestations of theory and that poems
can contain theories or anything else that finds its
way into the work.  Did I miss a posting from
Spencer concerning the nature of dialog?  The trick
to successful dialog is to pay attention to one another's
monologues rather than simply speaking to hear the
sound of your on voice.  Don't put words in my mouth
and I'll listen while you speak.
 
Best of all to all,
Jonathan

     I share Spencer's concerns, if not his negativity (which I appreciate
nonetheless). Here: Minneapolis-St. Paul, there's the MONOLITH (The Loft,
New Rivers, Graywolf, Holy Cow!, Milkweed, New Rivers, Coffee House
Press) and then there's "everyone else." "Everyone else" does not
constitute a community, and may never, though we might be better off if
it did. What we have (partial list, and forgive how reductive this will be):
        Charles Alexander (Chax Press, and Exec. Dir. of the MN Center
for Book Arts): Charles publishes and brings to MPLS-STPL mostly mid- or
advanced-career poets, writers and bookmakers. His primary (which
is not to say "only") "influence sphere" seems to be the language writers.
        Curt Anderson (_Exile_): Curt's interests are mostly classical; I
couldn't tell you what his contemporary "influence sphere(s)" might be.
        Erik Belgum (starting up a cassette label which will "publish"
sound/text pieces): Erik's "influence sphere" seems to be sound/text
artists, mostly Canadians, such as The Four Horsemen.
        Jonathan Brannen (Standing Stones Press): Jonathan's primary

I'd like to second the refrain that the messages are becoming an outlet
for a kind of agression that I don't really want to participate in. The
bleeri satires have a good resonance with the base line of discussion and
include themselves in poking fun. The current rash strikes me as mean
spirited although I agree with Alan again that it's not so much bashing
as a kind of misplaced homage. I hope you writers will...

I think Chris that the flames have a tendency to consume the firestarter. I
also think that you were attempting to prevent others from speaking in
the way they wanted to by "shouting" them down and in that way denied
them the right to speak how they wanted. There's a big difference between
asking someone to modify their approach and the agression of those
messages. If you are not happy with the way you yourself can address the
issues, I would suggest thinking about it and coming up with a coherent
response rather than with undifferentiated agression. I don't expect you
to agree, but I want to say it.
 
How is this different from the way you flamed Ron? It's more boring. It's
intention is clearer in that I am trying to get you to stop attacking
people and gaining control of everyone's e-mail list under the guise of
parody. And I am giving you the option. There are other valid
interpretations, but that is the way I felt reading those recent messages.

to all
several things:
1. re: Charles Alexander's
Getting back to what was a topic at the begining of the po/theor
discussion, which was about whether every poem had a theory within or
behind it, whether poems embodied theory in some way . . .
 
Curious that I put in one comment about what interested me most in theory and
Gary S. took that to mean something about my poetry. I discussed it with him
offline, but it seems that in many minds theor/po are
automatically/inextricably linked.  I don't consider my writing at all to be
poetry of personal experience, I have my methods which come from personal
experience but does that make the writing itself that method?
Not in my opinion. How does this fit into the discussion?
 
2. re Spencer's list of eight and the other's replies and reactions - again
curious how expressing valid concerns and problems is viewed as "negativity",
"frustration", etc. Egads if you aren't frustrated with the literary
community  you must be in serious denial, and if that constitutes negativity
then so be it! Running a reading series in S.F. has made it very clear to me
that no community exists here today, except as it serves the various spheres
of influence. It puts me in mind of James P.Carse's Finite and Infinite Games
- [The fluidity of our social and therefore personal existence is a function
of our essential freedom - the kind of freedom indicated in the formula "Who
must play, cannot play." Of course as we have seen, finite games cannot have
fluid boundaries, for if they do it will  be impossible to agree on
winners... It is this essential fluidity of our humaness that is
irreconcilable with the seriousness of finite play. It is, therefore this
fluidity that presents us with an unavoidable challenge: how to contain the
serious within the truly playful; that is how to keep all our finite games in
infinite play.]
 
Most important is to keep this list space fluid and free.

I've received a lot of backchannel queries about how I feel about the
Anti-Hegemony Project's "alt.fan.silliman" sequence (which by my count
stopped at around 25 messages).
 
I don't feel badly. I don't feel "flamed." And I don't particularly think
it was directed at me except in that "homage by ambivalence" sort of way.
I (or at least a fictive Ron Silliman) was usually the object of some
commentary that was being ascribed to somebody else on the list (tho I
think one or two "authors" might not be up on email yet). Since they were
the ones having phoney words put in their mouths, I suspect that they
might feel much more violated in that they were alleged to believe/say
things they might not have any sympathy towards whatsoever. How does Lew
Daly feel about being characterized in such a two-dimensional Elmer
Gantry stereotype? It seemed to me throughout that whatever "meanness"
existed in the sequence largely was involved in mangling those alleged
voices.
 
 All the quotes of my work were generally accurate and so were a few of
critiques. (Yeah, I do use the anecdotal as a lever in my critical pieces
and it's worth thinking about the consequences of that. I've been trashed
for close reading before (by Don Byrd among others), as if the practice
itself were politically incorrect (rather than the uses to which it once
was put a full generation ago). But no, Ketjak is not a character. The
comment on barfing in K was supposed to call up questions of gender,
sexual practice and power. Those lines are grounded in autobiography, but
that's not the point. I can't imagine having an R. Crumb cover. I loved
the dream and have in fact stolen from it for a piece in progress, thank
you very much. Most serious critique of all: not one comment about any of
my last 6 books. And anybody who wants a copy of The Difficulties should
just write to me backchannel. I think I have a few left.)
 
The day before it all started, a lurker (you know who you are)  wrote to
me that one reason she posts so little to the group is the sense she has
of active hostility on the part of particularly the younger participants
toward us old-fart G1 types. People seem ready to jump all over a press
like Sun & Moon while nobody trashes New Directions. I responded to her
at the time that this was because New Directions was irrelevant, and that
this kind of response seems to me precisely an index of anxiety that
people may feel about a given person &/or institution. It's ultimately a
definitional process. How do we differentiate ourselves from our "elders"
especially when we admire their work and can't quite say why or how we
ourselves are so unalterably *different*?
 
I told her that I thought we'd been just as bad in our 20s, although she
personally denies it. (I don't: I got to really know Robert Duncan first
when I wrote to the SF Chronicle in '66 saying that the bust of Lenore
Kandel's Love Book gave writers and the ACLU the chance to extend the
first amendment by arguing for the right to produce erotica that was not
great literature or socially redeeming. Duncan went onto KQED television
to read his open letter denouncing me. I was 19 at the time, an
undergraduate at SF State, and a fun time was had by all. That was also
the year I wrote to Pound telling him how he ought to conclude the
Cantos--with a photo of the Hong Kong harbor, ancient boats bobbing in
front of highrises in the smog-filled sky, carrying the poem's move to
the graphic to a logical conclusion. I also wrote to Zukofsky, trying to
get permission to publish The Objectivist Anthology & the Objectivist
issue of Poetry as single volume. I no doubt explained to him in some
very condescending fashion the importance of his own work.  He sent back
a very gracious note that's in the archives at UCSD:
"No//but//sincerely,//LZ." I think that the evidence is clear that I was
a total brat as a kid, but I only picked on poets who meant a lot to me.)
 
E-space merely changes the dynamics a little. It gives everybody on the
list equal access in a way that sitting around the feet of a
pontificating Duncan at a party never did. So it doesn't surprise me at
all to see a dynamic I can still remember/recognize showing up here at
all. It's no different from what the Apexers are trying to do in their
editorials, but that's really the only  other kind of venue young writers
have for such a social move.
 
Ideally, though, e-space might actually change the dynamics over time.
Maybe if all we simply acknowledge and presume the state of easy access
(and, with it, the recognition that everybody's watching), we won't feel
so intimidated by older writers who love to hear themselves talk. It
would be interesting to see what might happen if younger poets could
develop in a supportive setting and older ones wouldn't feel so
threatened by difference among the next generation. How do we get there?
 
It's actually the same question that Gary Sullivan and others have been
asking.
 
I do have one suggestion that I think would make for an improvement all
around. When people send out parodies (even mean ones), have the courage
to sign it or at least to send it from an email address that let's
everyone know just who you are. Believe me, we don't bite. I think that a
lot of the bad feelings I hear being expressed, both publically and
otherwise, have as much to do with the anonymity of the project as with
anything that has ever been said. It's much harder to be an object of
parody if you don't know where it's coming from.

Subject:      theory and poetry
 
Perhaps, if it's not too late in the game on this one, I'd like to
mention something that I didn't see addressed in the recent theory/poetry
debates. Rather than talk about theory vs. poetry at all, might not one
mention that FORM is crucial to the presentation of ideas, that it's not
simply a "what" but also a "how," and in that sense, every piece of
writing (theory/poetry/fiction, call it what you will) has a form that
opens up or represses possibilities in words. In fact I always thought
that this was one of the most interesting thing about the work of people
like james sherry, ron silliman, leslie scalapino, many others--that the
"what" (ideas?) was not alienated from the how (the form), but realized
in it...
        What, that is, are the implications of a form of writing in
determining its meaning? Using such a question, falling back on
distinctions between poetry and theory just may not be the point at all.

My apologies to Jonathan Brannen and others for being reductive. (You
were warned.)
 
Also to anyone who felt "left out" by virtue of my limiting myself to
people in my area. It was meant as an example. I'm genuinely interested
in reading about others' experiences, & thought that might prompt a few.
 
That post, Jonathan, being a response to Spencer's well-stated ideas about
the differences between "community" and "spheres of influence." If you
did indeed miss Spencer's post, I'm sure he'd be happy to forward.
 
Sorry if what I said sounded like "Say! Let's put on a play! We can use
Grampa Joe's bedsheets as a curtain! and me & Sally Mae can act, swell,
you bet!"
 
Pretty much everyone here, Jonathan, those I mentioned, & others, have
tried to bring everyone together on different occasions. Some attempts
have been more successful than others, but I've never felt what we have
here is a "community." I'm sure others elsewhere in the States, in Canada,
England, New Zealand, Australia, etc., have made similar attempts. I
thought it worth bringing up for that reason. My questions weren't
rhetorical. I'm sorry if they came across that way.
 
If nothing else, someone who runs a radio program e-mailed me for Erik
Belgum's address; so, Erik's got at least one more place to send his tapes.
 
And, yeah, Jonathan: You *should* tell us about your books. I'm sure your
authors will appreciate it. Not to mention anyone who'd like to order
them but can't w/out your address because SPD has denied you (& other new
presses of your size publishing mostly younger writers) access.
 
Anyway, your point about listening is well taken. I'll shut up & lurk for
a while.
 
Yours,

The question, Gary (hi!) would be, if you published a book, say, on
Coffee House Press, if I published a book on Holy Cow! Press, if Chax
Press won an NEA, would we enter the MONOLITH?  My concern is that
your call for an "open community" begins by stating, ab inition, an
"division".  Even the LOFT & its new competitor, SASE, have sponsored
events by the Nuyorican poets. etc.  I mean you know I'd be the first
to agree that what is here (& most other places I've lived) could
use a life-support system.
        One argument might be that what I've outlined above consists
of "multi-cultural writing" that seems to me to have had oh so little
space/discussion in this "radical" or "experimental" or "whatever"
community, & has been outlined by others as explicity NOT "language
writing."
        I don't know: Basil Johnston's tales are magnificent, Gerald
Vizenor (now in Berkeley) is incredible.  So much, in fact, of the
Ojibwe & Ho-Chunk & Lakota & other Native writers are on par with or
excel whoever else might be "out there".
        Perhaps it's a question of how "community" is defined, whether
our litmus test is the level of semantic experiment, the level of com-
pliance w/ French theory-praxis, or elsewhere.

Subject:      Down in flames?
 
        The mood on this list shifts like the tides.  Yesterday
a near-hysterical tension; today the calm of reason.  The hysteria I
detected was provoked by the most recent spate of AHP parodies, which
moved me to write--I wanted to scold those who scolded.  I wanted to
defend not AHP but satire itself: it was being badly misrepresented.
Thus--
 
        Contrary to Susan Schwartz _et.al._, satire needn't be cleanly
targeted to be effective as hell.  Clean contrary to one particular
poster (sorry, I forget who), the greatest satirists knew fully well
that they made fun of themselves right along with their supposed
targets--that's why Swift, e.g., is enduringly interesting.
 
        Come on, you guys.  As Chris Funkhouser (et.al.?) points out,
the primary purpose of those parodies was surely not to skewer Ron
Silliman.  (Granted, his spanking of the Apexers did generate some
considerable ill will around here . . .)  I thought it plainly evident
that the "real" target of *all* AHP's stuff is this medium we're trying
to learn how best to handle.  ("We"?  Is there one?  Not 'til "we" found,
forge, constitute an "us": an always-ongoing project.)  Their satires on
the forms and styles of electronic communication--wire-service reporting,
vapid b-board chat, listserv intellectualizing, our labyrinthine
redistribution of posts within posts within posts--ring dead-on true.
I'm impressed.  And I have to assume there's more than one person producing
this stuff; otherwise I'm put to shame, because, even though I divide my
workday the way most of you-all do--i.e. between real writing, reading,
scholarly writing, reading, teaching, and reading--I too would like to
have such time on my hands (see below).
 
        But I guess you had to be there.  My wife kept asking me what was
so funny (she was watching television two rooms away, to give you a picture
of how I react to AHP when it comes across my screen), and damned if I could
explain.
 
        Oh yes--let me introduce myself:  Shy, uxorious WM, 40-ish
poeticslistlurking gradstud (i.e. no steady job), seeking same or Other or
better for serious discussion *and* serious fun (which is why I'm staying
tuned).  Hobbies: time is but the stream I go a-fishing in.
 
Thanks for attending

Mark,
I agree.  Dare I say that form and content are the same?
 
Perhaps this isn't appropriate for "poetics" discussion, but since I
write fiction as well, and in writing fiction I'm very fond of using
constrictive forms (somewhat re: Oulipo) precisely because it both
opens and represses possibilities for narrative constructs.  I tend
to avoid constrictive forms (no relation to new formalism which I
find unreadible) because they seem to limit possibilities, though
MacLow has produced some marvelous pieces this way.

Subject:      Phoney words
 
I didn't want to rush in with just another bucket
of water to toss on the "Ron Silliman" flaming. It
made me think of framing..
 
With this talk of flaming and hegemony, I wonder
if it's worth talking about the use of Names.
 
I'm not talking about the name as the practical
convenience or device that it is.
 
Of couse, in Japan, the last name comes first: your
setting, your kin/pattern, then the individual you. In
the west, the first name has far greater play. As a
person maybe finally I live by my first name.
 
Where'm I headed? As well as identification, names
carry privileges. Ron's (you know who) carries
privileges (and maybe notoriety too?!).
Lang-poets
seem still to associate their writings with their
names. The last time I asked to be published
(in NZ) without my name, I was refused.  In NZ up to the
60s a number of women writers would appear under
adopted names, sometimes men's.
 
It's this privileging of the name, as authentic,
integral, with authority, that POETICS goes some
way to abating. But it's the reason why so-called
younger generations of writers keep wanting to
move in on older (privileged) ones.  It's the same
game, huh. It's the power thing. Could be it's at
back of the gender-talk too. ANd the posts there
were concerning reading only Known (I think Marjorie
Perloff was involved) Names. It leans too much
on predisposition, supposition.
 
Because the name is taken to be such an integrated
circuit, something irrefragible(??), it's hard to
split up or share the renown it accrues.  We can have
it conferred on us (get someone Big to write in my
flyleaf), but it detracts nothing from the function
of Bigness, merely confirms it.  Same game.
 
What to do?  Allot ids? Swap names (or name-genders)
once in a while, have a lucky dip? have a name
amnesty for a week? Or maybe be allotted rankings
as to a name's current standing. Make teams?
Lousy solutions, I guess. But my point is
that this happens informally now too. On
my Mail List there is the sender's name and the
subject.  I find I'm as interested in the senders
name as the subject and am aware how this (is it
just me) predisposes my interest and to some
extent (is it just me?) my readerly anticipations.
I'm not convinced the pre-recognition
and pre-eminance associated with the formalized
use of proper names is so helpful. I don't
likw its use as a handlebar. I think texts
can have names and persons can have names but
why valorize one with the other. I'm unconvinced
its what best represents langpo and its poetics.
 
Of course, I'll leave my name anyway..

Whatever else might be said about Robert Bly, in the late 1960s and early
1970s in Minnesota it was his leadership that generated a poetry
community that understood itself to be exactly that, and poetry readings
and activities as means of building community.  As, for example, we would
have readings with multiple folks at a time -- with poets choosing to
read poems one after another in a conversation mode -- one poet would
start, someone would choose a poem in response to the first, and so on.
Or the publishing collective in which each group of 10 in the collective
chose the next 10 and then went on their way, so that the decision-makers
themselves were constantly changing...
 
Let me correct a typo in Even Shiva, the "fran" should read "frank."

I like your reply to the "flamers" although I think its over generous,
but that is a quality that we value in you. I do disagree on one point
though. I don't think it's up to the younger generation to create a
supportive environment, it's up to the older generation to create a
supportive environment, you know. These messages are testing the limits
of what can be said and in that they are valuable. If they go beyond the
limit of what others find acceptable, they need to be told, but the
support must come from those with the surplus to distribute.

also in minnesota (well, duluth) is Poetry Harbor, which published
_days of obsidian, days of grace: 4 native american writers_, as well
as Poetry Motel magazine, which certainly has no connection w/
French theory-praxis or langpo or whatever... but multiculti, & so not
missing frm yr list on that ground...
 
i'd guess no matter how much you/we try to enlarge our "community",
there'll still be "outsiders": folks whom you/we feel you/we have
little in common with.  & i'm not saying that's a bad thing, but
something we have to own up to, and not just ascribe to some "other"
(sorry for the ungainly you/we construction here; i wrote it out
w/ just "you" & then caught myself...)
 
so i'm echoing yr question & qualm, 'bout how we identify (w/) thee
MONOLITH...  and to suggest "communities" emphasis on the plural--
as a self-perception & antidote to the single-partyline-poetic that
seems to me at root of much of the in-fighting we've seen so much ov

Subject:      other side
 
I've already erased two responses to Auntie Hedge Enemy, but will make this
my statement of record: It seems to me they're only interested in talking to
people who get their jokes.  I missed most of them myself.  And I'm from
Buffalo, four years removed--I can only imagine the bewilderment of an
Australian (though on second thought rural Wisconsin actually doesn't seem
that much closer).  In any case, it's hard for me to buy the argument "This
isn't inane, it's just representing inanity."
 
As someone not in the loop, but trying to follow these conversations anyway
(I'm a fiction writer but rather bored with what's been going on in the
experimental vein there lately -- is it possible that Robert Coover is hot
again? -- finding recent poetry more eye-popping), I wonder, am I allowed to
ask a question, or do I have to study long and hard to acquire the
shibboleths first?
 
I do have a question.  I saw Hank Lazer give a paper at Louisville which was
down on a couple recent anthologies, including the new Messerli edited
Sun&Moon, _From the Other Side of the Century_, which strikes me as a fairly
good one (again I say from outside, but interested).   Lo, when I arrived
home, I'd been sent the book from my sister-in-law as a late birthday
present, a happy coincidence.  Looking at it, I take Lazer's point about the
structure, that is, that the four groupings (in shorthand:
"culture"/"self&society" (NYschool)/"language"/ "performance") are at least
as problematic as they are elucidating.  But I was more taken aback by what
it seems to me are a couple of striking omissions.  Ed Dorn, it seems to me,
should certainly be included in any selection of recent poets in an
innovative tradition concerned with (Messerli's explanation of section 1)
"cultural issues and a complex of overlapping ideas about myth, politics,
history, place, and religion"--I mean, that sounds like a DESCRIPTION of
Dorn's work.  And also Kenneth Koch, who strikes me as an integral part of
the NY school.  I saw him and Ron Padgett read at Woodland Pattern in
Milwaukee last year.  Koch was the headliner, Padgett seemed implicitly to
acknowledge this; Koch read the more challenging works (to my idea of
things), yet Padgett is in this anthology and Koch isn't.
 
Now I only got onto this list in November, and it seems likely that this
issue was visited some time in the past when I didn't, as they used to say
with CBs, have my ears on.  I have a sensitivity to not tying up the space;
but then I think, shit, my screens have been clogged with fuck-all for
weeks!!! (especially post-Louisville; I'm sure Steve Evans, Alan Golding, Bob
Perelman and others who were there have also been very much occupied with
simply getting through all the stuff that accumulated last weekend when we
were otherwise engaged)  Besides, it's like when you run into people who are
just now seeing Pulp Fiction for the first time: I don't mind if you say
"we've already had this conversation".  I'd just like someone to summarize it
for me.
 
And, yes, anthologies are always a problem.  But _The New American Poetry_
did reasonably important things it seems to me.  This one is self-consciously
coming in its footsteps.  There are differences of opinion, I'm sure, about
both Dorn & Koch, who it strikes me now similarly structure much of their
verse around satire, for instance.  Ron Silliman (never having seen him, I
picture him now with singed eyebrows) spoke a couple weeks ago about the NY
school and how for him, for better or worse but undeniably, Koch figured
prominently.  And if you're going to leave someone out, shouldn't you at
least say why (maybe Messerli has in a place I haven't yet looked).  Donald
Allen was explicit about why T.S. Eliot was left out of _Poetics of the New
American Poetry_ in his introduction to that work.

The formulation that form is content, or vice versa, is helpful if only
to refute the all too common idea that form is a box that somehow contains
any given content. A kind of transcendental, naturalized content, which
everyone knows, is common sense, contained in an arbitrary, imposed form.
This kind of simple opposition I don't find too helpful.
     But saying simply that form *is* content, or content *is* form, is,
I think a little too easy. It collapses what I think are real distinctions
between the two. If nothing else it isn't true to what I think is the real
struggle, the real battle, to fit what you are trying to say into how
you're trying to say it.
     And maybe this is the most helpful way of seeing the form/content
split that I know: as the record of a struggle. As form mediated by content
and content mediated by form. At least, I may add, on the level of composition;
as you try to write it. It may be easier, maybe neccessary, to say that there
is no difference on the level of reading; in other words, once you see
something in some form, it is impossible to imagine it in any other. But
on the level of writing, I find it more helpful to think of it dialectically.
     My two cents, Eric.

    I'd like to respond in an odd way to both Gary and Spencer's posts,ie,
to both the idea of community and spheres of influence. I'd like to respond
with the absolutely asinine question of what is poetry?
    I think the answer to that question, a question incidentally, that my
students ask me all the time, is that poetry is what poets say it is. But
that don't mean that anyone can say I believe poetry is a series of regular
belches in a dark room and be taken seriously. That is, not at least until
she/he comes up with a good reason why belches in a dark room are poetry, ie,
a theory of poetry that is comprehensive enough to be taken seriously.
     To switch to science: when Copernicus came up with his theory of the
solar system, what made it ultimately more compelling than the Ptolemaic
theory was that it accounted for more variables. In this way, then, I think
a given theory of poetry, and everyone begins to write a poem with a given
theory of poetry, must compete with earlier theorizations on this level, ie,
to take into account the gaps in our articulation of poetry and account for
them. That's what I think NY school did, and the l-school. That's where
the new group has to come in. Look for where the dominant strain can't
account, and  do so.
     This is, by the way, what ultimately made me switch from mainstream
AWP poetry, to experimental/avant garde/oppositional poetry: that the
notion of what poetry is is always questioned. Something, I think, we see on
this list all the time and is I think the most important contribution of it.
     Finally, Gary, please don't lurk. I've found your voice very helpful,
as well as Susan's and Jonathan's and others, if, for nothing else, we are
so far out of the loop.
    Thanks, Eric.

Not down on the anthologies but critical of them, i.e., including
praise and negative remarks.  The paper I read in Louisville is about
half of an extended essay/review which will appear in Contemporary
Literature in the Summer issue.  The three anthologies I discuss are
Lauter's (2nd ed.) Heath anthology of American Lit, Messerli's, and
Hoover's.  And my particular slant has to do mainly with issues of
pedagogy--the use of anthologies in the classroom & the limitations
of these particular anthologies.  I also, especially on Lauter,
consider multiculturalism and its relationship to aesthetic
diversity.  As for Messerli's anthology, I used it as a core textbook
in my Fall 94 course.  It IS a rich collection, but....

I just wanted to say that I found the spoof silliman lists absolutely
hilarious, that, as Elizabeth Burns says in the Dec 94 issue of Poetic
Briefs, one feels unwelcome thus silenced as a younger poet putting
forward reasoned radical critique of the older generation right now, so
all power to the anon AHP; and, above all, that the spoof as a total
brilliantly conveyed the feel of being a lurker on a list of people
*fascinated* by something you yourself don't love in that detail, as is
evidenced in a lot of responses to it. What I loved most of all about the
spoof was that it didn't do this last effect stupidly; it didn't offer
people saying nothing of interest at great length, but made some very
informed points about what they (and I) love about the good parts of
Ron Silliman's work, and worry over in the porn of it. A point is; you
probably wouldn't get this amount of spoof on a lot of the Language
Writers, because few of them maintain such a lasting impact on younger
readers, certainly myself, as Silliman. Above all, I want to say: the
spoof showed me, at least, what a very intelligent list on a very
interesting poet or poets (ie both alt.fan.silliman, *and* POETICS, this
list we're now "on") looks like to outsiders. I don't myself feel "outside"
nearly as much as I'd like to from an exciting margin. It makes me feel.

Not sure that I entirely agree with precisely *what* you said, but the
*way* you said it is the way. It's the form I tries to articulate earlier.
Wow.
      Thanks, Eric.

The single most fascinating thing about this list continues to be this
list, i.e. the way it morphs, mutates, grows etc.  Reminds me a little
of those computer games like SimCity or Civilization where your decisions
have to be made as your simulated police grows--when do you invent writing
and when do you just build more barracks etc etc  Only the analogy
immediately breaks down because in those "god games" one person makes
all the rules, while this Hydra-headed list is always dispersed, always
resisting the imposition of order even as "order" and self-ordering
necessarily become subjects of discussion.  I'm feeling inclined to
celebrate the flux and chaos, the giddy sensation of sliding out of
control, and i think the AHP stuff has been sort of exhilarating even
when it has been tiresome too.  And as someone else said, the best thing
about it has been it's canny and self-self-reflexive exploration of the
medium itself and all the different shifting, floating discourses of
cyberspace.  Of course, i can say all this from the safe standpoint of not
having been the object of satire, and i can understand why others might
feel assaulted.  But as i say, i'm inclined these days to celebrate the
mess and muck, especially as an order just came down from the Dean of Arts
and Sciences that no university facilities, including computer networks,
are to be used for political activity (he was responding directly to
an attempt to e-organize a protest against the Contract w/ America).  Now,
i can understand how some rules need to be sorted out for the medium--
i mean i wldn't want my mailbox to be deluged with the propaganda of my
political enemies.  But i find myself experiencing a certain fear of what
is to come and a sort of nostalgia for what hasn't quite passed.  As
big-business encroaches from one direction (e.g. Bill Gates about to
launch his own MicroSoft net) and govt. from the other what lies in store?
Will the chaos continue to roil and billow or will these/this be
remembered as the wild frontier days and daze that subsided beneath
the inevitable wave of tract housing and shopping malls (cf. America
On-Line, Prodigy, Compuserve etc etc

NOTE BENE: Two actions have been taken to legalize State repression of
the kind of work we are doing, i.e., using cyberspace to mobilize support
for resistance to Mexican government repression of those struggling for
democracy. The rubric under which these actions are being taken is
"counterterrorism" --a ploy which has been in use for almost 20 years
now. Please note that Clinton's executive order (2nd document
below) was signed on February 9, 1995, the same day Zedillo
ordered the military against the Zapatistas. Believe it or not absolutely
peaceful forms of resistance can be repressed using these means. PLEASE READ

Subject: New FBI Charter to Investigate Political Groups
Date: 2 Mar 1995 17:58:41 GMT
 
The following was posted on Peacenet and should be of paramount concern
to all activists - it looks like action needs to be taken on this bill
quickly.  Apologies if this has already been posted here.  Please forward
near and wide.
 
 
                 Omnibus Counterterrorism Bill
                   S. 390 and H.R. 896
 
     New FBI Charter to Investigate Political Groups
 
February 10, 1995 the Omnibus Counterterrorism Bill was introduced
as S. 390 into the Senate and as H.R. 896 in the House.  It was
initiated by the FBI, and passed on by the Justice Department and
the White House.  Senators Biden (D-DE) and Specter (R- PA)
initiated it in the Senate, Rep. Schumer (D-NY) and Dicks (D-WA)
in the House.  It has bipartisan support and could get expedited
action.
 
SUMMARY
*  THIS IS A GENERAL CHARTER FOR THE FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES,
INCLUDING THE MILITARY, TO INVESTIGATE POLITICAL GROUPS AND
CAUSES AT WILL.  The bill is a wide-ranging federalization of
different kinds of actions applying to both citizens and
non-citizens.  The range includes acts of violence (attempts,
threats and conspiracies) as well as giving funds for
humanitarian, legal activity.
 
*  It would allow up to 10 year sentences for citizens and
deportation for permanent resident non-citizens for the "crime" of
supporting the lawful activities of an organization the President
declares to be "terrorist", as the African National Congress, FMLN
in El Salvador, IRA in Northern Ireland, and PLO have been
labelled.  It broadens the definition of terrorism.  The
President's determination of who is a terrorist is unappealable,
and specifically can include groups regardless of any legitimate
activity they might pursue.
 
*  It authorizes secret trials fo
r immigrants who are not charged
with a crime but rather who are accused of supporting lawful
activity by organizations which have also been accused of
committing illegal acts.  Immigrants could be deported: 1) using
evidence they or their lawyers would never see, 2) in secret
proceedings 3) with one sided appeals 4) using illegally obtained
evidence.
 
*  It suspends posse comitatus - allowing the use of the military
to aid the police regardless of other laws.
 
*  It reverses the presumption of innocence - the accused is
presumed ineligible for bail and can be detained until trial.
 
* It loosens the rules for wiretaps.  It would prohibit probation
as a punishment under the act - even for minor nonviolent
offenses.
 
IMPLICATIONS
*  Those who remember the McCarran Walter Act will recognize this
bill, only in some ways this is broader and potentially more
dangerous
 
*  This bill is highly political:  the President can determine who
is a terrorist and change his/her mind at will and even for
economic reasons.  The breadth of its coverage would make it
impossible for the government to prosecute all assistance to
groups around the world that have made or threatened to commit
violent acts of any sort.  Necessarily its choices would be
targeted at organizations the government found currently
offensive.  People to be deported would be chosen specifically
because of their political associations and beliefs.
 
* The new federal crime:  international terrorism doesn't cover
anything that is not already a crime.  As the Center for National
Security Studies notes: "Since the new offense does not cover
anything that is not already a crime, the main purpose of the
proposal seems to be to avoid certain constitutional and statutory
protections that would otherwise apply."
 
*  While many provisions of this bill could well be found
unconstitutional after years of litigation, in the mean time the
damage could be enormous to the First Amendment and other
constitutional rights including presumption of innocence and right
to bail.
 
THE BILL HAS BEEN REFERRED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEES OF EACH HOUSE.

Reply-To:     UB Poetics discussion group <POETICS@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>
Sender:       UB Poetics discussion group <POETICS@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>
From:         Charles Bernstein <BERNSTEI@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>
Organization: University at Buffalo
Subject:      The List Itself
 
The List Itself
 
1.  I appreciate discussions of the format of this discussion
group, since many of the subscribers to Poetics receive the posts
in different personal circumstance (at home, at the office); with
different automatic formatting (headings, directories); and with
different software (facilitating up and downloading, or making it
impossible).  Insofar as possible, I would hope the list might be
able to conform to the specific needs of the participants.  But I
have limited knowledge of the listserve program that determines
some of the choices available.
 
2.  Please note that if your e-mail server is down, or if your
personal mailbox is full, and a Poetics message gets bounced, you
will be automatically unsubscribed from the Poetics listserve.
When your system comes back on line or you have cleared your back
messages, just subscribe anew.  It should be easy enough to tell
if you subscription has been "auto-deleted": a day will pass with
no Poetics posts!
 
3.  The DIGEST option is working and that is clearly useful for
those who want all the Poetics messages from one day sent as one
single e-mail post, or for those whose systems set limits on
individual messages.  (To get DIGEST, send a one-line message
with no subject line to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu: set poetics
digest; to remove digest send a message that says: set poetics
mail.)
     I have no control over the format of the DIGEST: the
listserve program generates the daily digests automatically.  If
you use the reply option to respond to a message sent in the
Digest, the subject line will be the Digest subject head; if
possible, send such a message direct to Poetics so that you can
write the subject line yourself.
 
4.  To some extent, the Digest option resolves the problem for
those for whom the volume of messages is difficult to handle.  My
commitment is to keep this space open and unregulated -- indeed,
I suspect it is the unregulated aspect of the listserve format
that is particularly appealing for a list like Poetics.  There
are no circumstances under which I would consider formally
"moderating" this list; though this is an option for other lists
because the listserve program makes it possible for messages to
be sent to the listowner _before_ they are distributed.  In any
case, rest anxious, "moderation" has never been considered here
at Poetics@UBVM!
 
5.  I am interested in continuing to explore what formats and
styles of posting encourage, rather than simply allow,
participation in this "virtual uncommunity".  The volume of
messages is certainly a useful measure of list activity; but
volume itself may be an obstacle for some to participate, just as
it may encourage others.  Who subscribes is a crucial element:
both subscriptions and posting on Poetics are unrestricted, which
allows participants to subscribe and unsubscribe themselves at
will.  When people send me inquiries about the list, I send them
the "welcome" message and, generally, ask them to subscribe
themselves.  The list remains "private", which means that our
address will not be found in Guides to the Internet; word-of-
mouth (or word-of-net?) seems a better way of including
individuals who have a commitment to our multiple areas of
investigation.  I believe that without some sense of limit,
albeit constructed in process, the always fragile sense of
intimacy or relatedness that fosters some forms of conversation
can easily be lost.  But then again, maybe I am resisting the
sheer magnitude of the net, as if an imaginary seawall can ever
hold back the sea?  In any case, different lists and bulletin
boards and newsgroups will approach the limits of participation
in different ways; no one list can possibly embody all the
possibilities.  Even as it gets bigger, I still think of this
list as "small-scale".
 
6.  As listowner, I spend a certain amount of time dealing with
list maintenance.  That remains my primary commitment here, even
when it prevents me, given drastically limited time, from
participating in other ways.  There are many posts that I would
like to respond to, but to which I am only able to compose
responses in my head.  I suspect this is true many participants,
for several different reasons.  I am particularly conscious of
this when someone notes a lack of response to their post: I want
to call out that it wasn't lack of interest but lack of time!;
and I know this is a common feeling.
 
7.  I think of the listserve as a distinct medium, but what
characterizes this medium?  My question is partly, what does this
medium make possible that is not possible in other language
media?  Cris Cheek and Kali Tal have both offered elucidating
descriptions of the medium as improvisatory and I suspect that
their thoughts on the matter come close to answering my
questions.  But just as TV was filled with content from older
media, such as movies, so listserves will also be filled with
older genres: letters, essays, catalogs, etc.  I have found it
difficult to leap into the specifically listserve space, and my
own contributions, like a number of others, have tended to be
composed offline and over fairly long periods of time.  I hope
that those like me who are still squeamish about the immediacy of
this space will participate in less immediate, but no less
performative or theatrical, modes: for a theatrical space like
this can also be used in refractory and constructed manners.
 
******8.  Amidst the discussion, I want to reiterate the value of
information postings by presses and magazines.  Full catalogs of
small press publishers are always welcome and will be separately
listed at the Electronic Poetry Center site.  Please also send
notices of new books or magazine issues!  Individuals are also
encouraged to send information on their own new books or other
publications.  Recommended reading, with ordering information, is
also welcome.  ************************
 
9.  The Poetics list was started in January 1994.  Since then
there have been over 1600 posts.  As of today, there are 192 subscribers
to Poetics.
     I thought some of you might like to see a copy of a post I
made one year ago.  It's called "Hermits Crabs Don't Cry."  I
will send it as a separate post following this.

HERMIT CRABS DON'T CRY
 
On one of my frequent trips to the Folded Place
inside the Ethernet's Thirteenth Passage,
with the new translation into Idiophone
of Moses Maimonides's Guide for the Perplexed
in my left hand, I had occasion to jot
down some rules of conduct (not so much
community standards as uncommunity striations)
into my Blake's Newton Feelpad (TM pending)
(a pad is  after all a kind of home,
or used to be).  The Feelpad, as many
of you will know (and I use the word "you"
carelessly), is able to convert inner feeling
processes into linguistic signs.  The
protocols of the Blake's Newton Feelpad
do not allow me to review the file before
downloading directly onto your screens
(and I also use the word "your" carelessly):
 
All of these proposed Listserve Rules
will be enforced through a fully automated
new version of the Youngman Listserve Program
(Henney 33.95).  As I am sure you will agree
(and I use "you" loosely), Total Automation
of rule enforcement is the only way to ensure
fair and impartial Rule Maintenance:
 
1.  Postings on Poetics@UBVM shall be
neither in prose or verse. Rather,
all postings shall conform to shifting
character/line formats, announced
periodically on the list.  Initially,
lines shall have at least 43 and no more
than 51 characters; hyphenation is
discouraged.
 
2. No messages shall be posted between
:43 and :52 minutes after the hour.
 
3.  All postings shall be made from
"Dos"-type platforms; Apple users
may post from "IBM"-type computers
but the graphic orientation of
Macs make these environments
inappropriate for Poetics postings.
 
4. You have to sound 30 or show ID.
 
5. On the third Friday of every month, only short
"chat" messages to friends on the list may be posted.
For those without, or who no longer have, friends
on the list, a message service will be available
to provide names of friends as well as appropriate
messages.
 
6. The Listowner will provide a name
purging service to permit anonymous
postings.  Purged names will remain
strictly confidential, although, at
the Listowner's discretion, they may be
sold, on condition of continued
confidentiality, to benefit the outreach
services at Poetics@UBVM provided
by Whitewater Development Company.
 
7. Subscribers to Poetics@UBVM agree to
end all "back channel" communication.  All
communication among subscribers shall be
sent to the list as a whole: no individual
e-mail or conventional mail may be
exchanged, no face-to-face verbal
communications will be permitted
(nonverbal communication is in no
way restricted by this rule).
At first, this may be difficult
for those who live in the same area.
But, over time, the enormous advantages
to community-building will become
apparent.
 
8.  In order to cut down on those repulsive
smile icons that are used on Other Lists
to indicate humorous intent (as we used
to say in Method Acting class -- DON'T
INDICATE) [Remember the one about the actor who
asked the director what his motivation was to
walk across the set and light a cigarette, to
which the director replied, "your motivation is,
that if you don't, you'll be fired"?] --
where was I? even when I write I lose track
of where I am -- oh yeah,
in order to cut down on those smile icons,
and for other reasons that should be
obvious to all of you (I use the word
"you" inadvisedly), all irony
(including sarcasm, schtick,
mocking, jokes, and comic innuendo)
will be prohibited from the list.
This is a particularly difficult rule
to enforce automatically, but recent,
unpublishable, research, indicates
that there may be genetic markers of
sarcasm and our team of crack(ed?) computer
experts are working around the clock
to find programs to detect this "irony
gene" in linguistic expression.
 
 
>FINALLY<
For those who have asked that this
listspace move toward *reality* rather than
float in talky virtuality, the following rule
implementation procedure will be adopted:
 
If there is significant sentiment on the
list in favor of these rules, they will
not be adopted; if, in contrast, there
is strong opposition to these rules,
they will become effective immediately.
 
In addition, to bring even more reality
into the system, between three and five
Listserve Rules will remain concealed
from all subscribers AND about one percent
of all messages will be randomly deleted
before delivery.

I would be interested to know (lurking taken to a deeper level?) what kinds
of things various people on this list think about relative to form (or not)
when you are in the "thinking about" stage of creating a text.  Or, when you
are making something, at what point form entered the picture.  I guess I'm
asking for some seminarish exploration with you, your work (whoever you are
out there) as the subject.  This is just an open question, not a "guess what
I'm thinking" game of any kind.  It would seem there are multiple
possibilities.  As with so many things, there are seemingly infinite ways to
do this right.  But that's not the point anyway.

Almost all my current writing is completed on the Internet, published and
distributed on the Internet; hard-copy, magazines, etc. are secondary. So
I am aware always of the form of email itself - the reading environment,
the nature of the headers, the attention-span of readers, and in
particular, the very _appearance_ of ascii text and its "scroll." (I tend
to write about "scroll" itself as a form of vision, envisioning. So for
me, the text exists in a mobile field, a field of movement, and I have
seen film-scripts on the Net that in fact take advantage of this.
 
Beyond that, there is a sense of ransacking traditional literature and
its values, in a manner consistent with my notions of dissolution. And
there is always a sense that my work is archived at a web site and
elsewhere, and how the individual components string together.
 
Finally, I've learned enough about the TCP/IP protocols to understand
_how_ transmission occurs, what battles are being fought in the protocol
suite itself, and among its designers. And that affects the surface
content as well.

Subject:      COMMUNITY/LURKING
 
Gary, I hope that you DON'T shut up.  Keep those posts coming.  You
contribute to the vibrancy of the list.
 
I am interested in several people's comments about community.  I think that
I've found in the postal system for many years a vehicle for community.  Or
of creating intimacies (several micro-communities).  I know a number of
writers in Arizona and care very much for a number of friends in what might
be called a community.  But the way I've always functioned is to commune a
bit more directly on paper or one-on-one in the mails with certain people in
the writing world (whatever one would call it) than I do face-to-face with
people who are geographically near.  And both kinds of relating are wonderful
in their way.  Now, with the net (funny word; in addition to conjuring up
webbed-ness, it seems to suggest catching, as in fish or butterflies),
there's a different way (some might say better, but certainly quicker,
whatever your position on that point) to commune.
 
Maybe one of the things I'm leading to or discovering as I tap is that
community can't be pushed, although a number of things are catalytic to
creating it.  For example, projects.  Projects are the most  wonderful
catalysts.  Certain people function that way, too.  But, again, it sort of
happens.
 
I don't quite know what to make of the discussion about Minnesota, so I'm not
sure I would ever presume to be of direct help.  Mostly, the message might
be, though, that certain (sequences of) projects will shape into the
community they desire (even if ad hoc) very quickly.  Projects that people
care about deeply.  Once again, not unlike the world of earnings.
 
In Phoenix, we are known for not having a very strong poetry community, but
we surely have a number of poets.  And a number of people know one another
very well.  Personally, I'm quite satisfied with what we have, as I sort of
like having the freedom to work on my own, but then to have a positive spirit
among a number of people whom I've known and cared about for years.  I guess
that some definitions are necessarily quite demanding, even unrealistic.
 
Enough for one sitting.
 
Sheila

Subject:      Re: Form As Discussion Point
 
   At the risk of being accused of being "wishy washy" (or "worse,"
   "Derridean,") I begin in what may seem like a "middle" (of undifferentiated
    nothingness) in response to Sheila Murphy's thought provoking "open
    question" of the "'thinking about' stage of creating a text...
    (and the idea that..."the seeming inifinite ways to do THIS right"
    is "not the point." The question of what one considers "better" writing,
    "publishable" is related to the question of "getting lost in the writing"
     and the question of being suprised by one's "own" writing, of trying
    to avoid paralyzing self-consciousness, of the desire "to get all of
    life in the text" and keeping attentive and not getting carried away
    on romantic pipedreams that may be the kind of distractions that are
    necessary for the piece of writing to seem to "take off" as it were
    (though there must be a pre-airplane way of saying that)...and the
    question of POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY in the writing act, of editing out
    the POLITICALLY IRRESPONSIBLE points, as if you in "recollections of
    tranquility" you actually know what is politically responsible...
    and the question of various discourses, of the text explaining itself,
    of the THEME AS THE THING, and the whole socio-historical allegory of
    text circulation as if composition is explanation...Not all of these
    things always matter, but the question of "theory" and "practice" can
    be expressed "poetically" as easily as "theoretically" and so evey
    every debate is also a "meta-debate" and maybe is only a meta-debate
    in an anti-essentialist world in which "having bodyguards but no bodies"
    (Perelman) is an attractive metaphor, just like Shakespeare's "putrified
    core"--Anyway, this ties in with ALAN SONDHEIM'S assertion that there
    is IN HIS WORK "a sense of ransacking traditional literature and values,
    in a manner consistant with (his) notion of dissocation"--But what ARE
    these "traditional literatures and values"? The WESTERN CANON is not
    set in stone as purely aestheticized...What I thought I once wanted
    to subvert is not necessarily "traditional literature" but "traditional
    criticism" that has lent "respectibility" and aesthetical-object status
    to certain writings by misreading it in such a way as to make one want
    to turn to the "avant-garde" (studd not taught in schools, the whole
    "auto-didact" cult from which I learned much---correction "studd" is
    "stuff"), to make one want to turn to a mere inversion of "traditional"
    values, an inversion that is no better than the so-called "tradition"--
    In fact, one could say the "tradition" NEEDS THE ANTI-TRADITIONAL to
    prop itself up...and this binary view of culture is only interesting
    as a starting point one may return to again and again on the level of
    seeming, though of course you'll be accused of being some mere spinning
    your wheels ORC-CYCLE maya/karma being by those who seem to stand
    so completely in some "desolation row" of visionary rhetoric they
    put all their emotions in the PAST--this, too, is an interesting
    "rhetorical strategy" and may reach a point in which it becomes more,
    or at least OTHER, than a "rhetorical strategy"--but whether or not
    this POINT is THE POINT OF NO RETURN is a question i leave to anyone
    who wishes to take it up...Chris Stroffolino

Briefly to Mark, Sheila, Gary, Charles, Kali, Eric and others re Community
and Spheres of Influence.
 
This is a community in formational flux.
What's workable is who's here now rather than necessarily who those people
who are here presently reference.
This community will or rather might inconsiderately replicate its existing
character preferences unless its behaviour positively embraces both its own
and others diversity.
Learning ways to be welcoming  -  to find the touch that's otherwise too
carefully thought out from this e-space, bristled and defensive.
It's they who fear who feel the need to attack. Challenge is not
necessarily struggle. Struggle can too easily become binary dogma.
What's present can all too easily become resent.
 
Our (unpack baggage) behaviour (unpack baggage) or tone can (what is a tone
can?) too easily (unpack baggage) disperse (unpack baggage) or repel
(unpack baggage) that community (unpack baggage) which we (unpack baggage)
imagine (unpack baggage) we (deconstruct unpacked baggage) could (post to
Utopia) be (and tell Zeno it explains everything and so tells us nothing
(unpack baggage)).

Subject:      CALL: Sound and Language RE: - Submissions
 
I'm editing (and got the money to do) a series
of 5 books (each about 70pp and featuring between
3 - 6 writers) which are going to be
produced by Sound & Language from May/June this year.
 
The issue is to cast the most provocative net into:
 
-   writing either made for performance
-   or developed / constructed through performance
-   or directly related to performance
 
Some notes and photographic documentation (b/w I'm afraid)
will be included.
Get in touch direct with me if you've got something that
might open that net.
To give some idea I'm already on the case (and have some
work) by some of the following with more coming:
 
Carla Harryman, Jean Binta Breeze, Aaron Williamson, Fiona
Templeton, Gary Stevens, Forced Entertainment, Brian Catling,
Steve Benson, Caroline Bergval, Deborah Levy, Fiona Wright
Nancy O'Reilly, Charles Stein, Jackson MacLow, Guillermo Gomez Pena
David Antin and many others
 
I'd welcome any leads if it's not your own particular.
 
I'm keen to present work from across art-forms and so by artists
making challenging writing but who aren't primarily known
as writers.
Multi-voice texts - dark-side monologues - documentation of
improvisation / compositions - texts from videos / installations
'performance poems' - photographic poems  -  explorations of
the book as a site (for performance)
 
It's taking shape now and over the coming months.
Issues 1 and 2 will be available by mid-summer.
The whole project is hoped to be over within 18 months
and there's a potential development into (groan) anthology
or just collecting it all into a pleated reprint.
 
Please get in touch with any suggestions / submissions / questions,
 
and Please pass this on if appropriate
 
best wishes

Cris, your well-stated post re: community dragged me out of lurkdom to
respond.
 
>This is a community in formational flux.
     Definitely.
 
>What's workable is who's here now rather than necessarily who those
people who are here presently reference.
     I exist by virtue of my mother and father; therefore, my existence
     references them. To deny their existence is to deny my own.
 
>This community will or rather might inconsiderately replicate its existing

     Agree.
 
>Learning ways to be welcoming - to find the touch that's otherwise too
carefully thought out from this e-space, bristled and defensive.
     Agree, though time and thought unbristle, too.
 
>It's they who fear who feel the need to attack.
     Not always. Fear stifles more than it incites. Attackers are
     more often angry than fearful. & some anger is justified.
 
>Challenge is not necessarily struggle.
     Not until it's resisted.
 
>Struggle can too easily become binary dogma.
     A single, unchallenged dogma can just as easily become fascism.
 
>What's present can all too easily become resent.
     Resentment is a response to lack, as well as surfeit. What's not
     present might just as easily foster resentment.
 
>Our (unpack baggage) behaviour (unpack baggage) or tone can (what is a

     Our (deny feelings) behavior (stuff shirt) or tone might (tone +
     might = ?) also incite discourse (spray armpits with chemicals) which
     might ("Let the machine get it, honey") give rise to (repeat to remove
     accent) greater understanding (send paranoid message backchannel) of who
     we (tell Diogenes you can't debase debased coinage) are (strike "genuine
     desire to positively change things" and insert "negativity"; stamp
     folder "miscreant"; file under "mudslinging"; close drawer; open mind;
     insert air freshener; close mind).
 
Those caveats aired, I do agree, and appreciate your post.
 
Sincerely,

Gary, thanks for responding and thanks for qualifying some of my over-
simplistics, necessary business.
 
Please Don't Lurk (sounds like it should be a pop refrain).
 
Yes, Denial or rejection of the past are 'classic' fascist characteristics.
There are also the boorish Buff type impositional tyrannies of competitive
knowledge and the denial of the present through continual deflection. A
kind of unfocussed peevishness, sometimes at becoming oneself
misunderstood. It's been read that way and that's my shoddy peripherality.
And Between  -  My States of Attention. But then this country is a capital
of the heartlands of denial.

p.s. I'd like to suggest that 'lurking' be valued as a positive rather than
a negative aspect. But it can go so cold it freezes.
Certainly attention focussed onto activating and facilitating rather than
dominating and controlling 'conversation'.

I get a little nervous with extensive discussions about formation of
community, actually, for it often seems to take the place of engaging in
the activities in the doing of which we become one...
 
There are of course cultural aspects to the net community thing, as
elsewhere.  Native Americans (who are seeking sovereignty in cyberspace
as well as in material space), for example, are concerned about the clash
between net culture and their own.  In most Native American societies,
the most important people are those who are silent in public and sit at
the back of the room, while it is the younger and less influential folks
who make the noise.  Obviously, this would be problematic in the effort
to sustain their culture within the net.  (There are many examples,
actually, of the use of new information technologies in the sustenance of
traditional cultural forms, but there are other examples, as well, where
this is problematic.)
 
About four years ago, after attending a string of 7 conferences from
Moscow in the former USSR through eastern and western Europe and Eastern
and Middle US (winding up in Urbana), I was quite struck by the
difference in terms and conceptualizations used to talk about what were
often the very same matters facing the formation of communication
policy.  In the former Warsaw Pact countries, there is great and explicit
concern about the possibility of civil society; in Western Europe,
concern over the sustenance of the public in a time when media were
becoming privatized; in the US, it's all audience and, as individuals,
we've moved from citizens to consumers.  In the case of this list, from
my perspective, one of the things that makes it a community is a sense of
shared substance, including sharing with those who may not be speaking
much.  Silence and listening are the undervalued communications practices
of our time....

Sandra Braman, Sheila Murphy, Mark Wallace, & all
 
     Sandra, what you say about Native American culture can't be denied by
someone like myself, whose primary, direct experience with Native American
culture has been mostly through my work at the Legal Aid Society of
Minneapolis/Housing Discrimination Law Project. My interaction with both
NA clients and NA lawyers has been mostly instances where indigenous and
non-indigenous cultures in the U.S. interact, or as is often the case,
clash.  I've attended a few readings and other events featuring Native
American writers, and the audiences for these events have been of mixed
race. So, I do appreciate what you have to say about how (some of) these
cultures behave publicly, within their specific social groups. (I'd like
to get more of that, actually, which is why I appreciate Mark Nowak--a
"younger" poet--'s lists of work so much; want more from him.)
     But, Sandra, I do think younger poets have been listening to, mainly
by reading, older poets; I came to poetry not out of a desire to write it,
which came later, but to read it. I spent many years reading poetry (if
not as "intensely" as I do these days) before I wrote my first poem. I
think most of us began, first, by reading, or "listening to," our elders.
     Relative to that: In response to both Sheila Murphy and Mark
Wallace's questions about form, & the "how" & "why": The first poem I
wrote that "mattered" to me was written in direct response to work I'd
been reading in an early issue of _avec_ that my wife Marta & I had
typeset. As John Geraets (I believe) pointed out, one of the things
younger poets respond to are "lacks"--and I felt a definite "lack" in the
poetry I found there, which I was forced to read very slowly, if not
always as carefully as I should've, as I was typing it into the computer;
specifically, I was in love (still am), but having difficulty verbally
expressing that emotion to my wife without it being corny, reductive and
cliche, and none of the poetry in that _avec_ *seemed* to include this
most basic of human instances. I thought I might take phrases and lines
from what (at first) seemed to be the very abstract language in _avec_,
and somehow use that language, re-presented, to speak, as directly as I
could, to my lover. Much of the language I "ripped off" was language
having to do with the difficulties of communication, and so my concerns,
as it turned out, where not altogether different from my elders'. But it
took writing something, working on it for six months, for me to really
understand that. What began out of an apparent difference of "concerns"
developed into a further understanding, for me, of the nature of the work
in _avec_. What began as resistance, struggle, which wasn't resolved by my
reading the work, ended, by virtue of my active participation with it
(re-using the language, "against"  its apparent context), in my reaching a
point where I began to appreciate writing I'd at first mistrusted.
     Participation isn't necessarily noise, and I do hope that other
younger or less-established writers will respond to Mark W.'s and Sheila
M.'s questions (I've enjoyed that by those who have). Bill Luoma, how did
you come to write _My Trip to New York_? Is your work--as I'm reading
it--predominantly "speech- based"? Mark Nowak, how do you use,
specifically, all of the diverse material you read? What are the
difficulties you've faced in doing that, if any? Erica Hunt, can you take
what Mark Nowak addressed in his last post further by talking about your
own work, influences? Ira Lightman, "No Things But in Ideas," the work of
yours I read in _Mirage_; would you be willing to talk a little about how
the form (a brief excerpt)

     I'd like to read more of what younger or less-often published writers
have to say about their work, about poetry, specifically or generally.
(Questions above not being rhetorical, or necessarily limited to those
addressed, or even to "younger" poets.)

sandra and others:  i recently had the pleasure of reading a dissertation
that brings theories of complex systems to bear on the composition process,
via three case studies, to yield "ecologies of composition"... the diss.
is by margaret a. syverson, entitled "the wealth of reality:  an ecology
of composition" (university of california at san diego, 1994)... i believe
it to be a brilliant work, one that provides a much richer account of
reading, writing and textuality than i've seen to date within the composition
field per se (and whatever local reservations i might have)...
 
i find this pertinent to the discussion hereabouts for two (general) reasons:
one, that the first of syverson's case studies consists of examining
the various factors surrouding the writing/revision/publication of charles
reznikoff's "early history of a writer"; and two, that the last of syverson's
case studies consists of a discourse-analysis-based account of conflict that
emerged in an electronic forum during the gulf war... in short, i found the
theoretical claims made by syverson to jibe well with my own sense of how
complex writing and reading and corresponding in fact are... whether the model,
if you will, that she employs is found by some in these parts to be a bit
restrictive (or reductive) is less to the point, i think, than that there *does*
in fact exist theoretical speculation, if you will, that attempts at least
to advance in methodological terms a view of process that perhaps, just perhaps
poet
s too may find useful/enlightening...
 
anyway, if any of you do manage to have a look-c, i'd be much interested in
what you think...
 
in any case, i don't believe folks in the humanities should resist ipso facto
empirical claims, and i do believe that 'we' have something vital to add to
more methodologically-centered fields... and that 'we' includes poets, i'm
trying not to speak solely as what i in fact am in part---an academic...

december--poems, songs, dance, two-voice pieces.  jack is a great
resource, fine connection to the writing/performings of others.
(jack & adelle, for example, are recorded on lou harrison's most

sandra, what's fascinating about syverson's dissertation is the extent to
which she manages to employ concepts such as distribution, embodiment,
emergence and enaction (across social, psychological, material, spatial
and temporal constraints) in her approach to different writing situations
WITHOUT a rigorous mathematical model and WITHOUT generating more metaphorical
platitudes... that is, she shows how such a model can be put to practical
use in the educational arena proper... for a lot of artists, such concerns
are strictly ex post facto, and while it is true that syverson is primarily
concerned not with the particular writing or corresponding activity or
practice but with the extent to which such inquiry informs the sorts of
ecologies we contribute to (willingly or otherwise, no determinism implied
or intended) i found much in her sense that such practices are intrinisically
*historical* (i.e., time-(inter)dependent and dynamic) as opposed to simply
structural (and cause-effect based) to help breathe some reflexive life into
my own meanderings of late...

Subject:      Close Reading
 
Can someone please tell me exactly *why* the "close
reading" of texts is such a reprehensible practice? I
notice it came up in an oblique sort of way in the
Silliman Fan Club brouhaha, and I'm probably showing my
complete and utter ignorance and stupidity. On 2 March
Ron said that "I've been trashed for close reading
before (by Don Byrd among others), as if the practice
itself were politically incorrect (rather than the uses
to which it once was put a full generation ago)."
However one reads Silliman's prose I would not think
he's instructing his reader how a text ought to be
read, but recording how he himself reads it (and what
he thinks &c &c) on one particular occasion in a
particular context.
 
I'd assume that the opposite of a "close" reading is
not so much a "distant" one as a "vague" or
"inattentive" one (though I'm not at all sure exactly
what those words mean in this context). Is there a
point at which a "vague" reading gets to be
reprehensible, or preferable? (And so on.)
 
This is not a facetious question. I like reading, and
I'm really interested in the sorts of strategic
decisions people actually make when they read; I'm
interested in *how* they read (I'm not all that sure
how *I* read, either, come to that, and if I have a
method at all it sure changes a lot, day to day, book
to book, poem to poem). I'd have thought "close
reading" would be less rather than more reprehensible,
so I ask the question in all seriousness.

Dear Peter:
 
Good question, re: "close reading". I certainly can't speak to the
specificity of the reference to Ron Silliman and Don Byrd. Generally
though, my experience is that "close reading" has become demonized by
association with "New Criticism", and entered the panoply of sins
connected with formalist concepts of the poem. The opposite of
"close reading" (in this demonology) would be "contextual reading"
rather than "inattentive". So that "close reading", having been
politicized in this binary opposition, is now short hand for
reactionary, agrarian, humanistic reading, as opposed to progressive
historically, socially, economically, racially contexualized reading.
 
Any serious reader, it seems to me, would laugh at such a distinction.
But whole careers are built on it. Alas.

Dear Peter,
 
It seems to me that Michael Boughn's "demonology" is largely accurate as an
account of the use of "close reading" in many circles today--many in the
academy do seem to set up "close" and "contextualized" reading as (false)
binaries, attributing the former to the now vanquished practices of New
Criticism.  But there are other attacks on "close reading" coming from other
directions, within and without the academy.  Here "close reading" seems really
to mean something closer to "controlling reading" or "controlled reading."
Charles Bernstein's poetics of "errant singularity"--Altieri's phrase--seems to
use the phrase "close reading" in that second way, for instance.  Thus in
_Artifice of Absorption_ we have the following: "The obvious problem is that
the poem said in any other way is not the poem.  This may account for why
writers revealing their intentions or references ('close readings'), just like
readers inventorying devices, often say so little:  why a sober attempt to
document or describe runs so high a risk of falling flat.  In contrast, why
not a criticism intoxicated with its own metaphoricity, or tropicality: one in
which the limits of positive criticism are made more audibly artifical; in
which the inadequacy of our explanatory paradigms is neither ignored nor
regretted but brought into fruitful play."  Or one might look at the recent
_Exact Change_ interview with Michael Palmer, where, discussing "voice in
Stevens" and the appropriation of Stevens by New Critics Palmer says,
"I think the reason that finally--after initially ignoring Stevens, perhaps
because of his difficulty--the New Critics began to attend to him was because
they could finally see the control of tone, etc., as susceptible to close
reading.  And I think I've always tried to undermine close reading, to make it
unreadable from that point of view."
 
It seems to me that we have two problems then--how to dismantle the binary
Michael Boughn refers to, and how to present a model of close reading which
would allow for openness, uncertainty, and generosity to stand in for the
desire for "mastery" always--perhaps falsely, it's been so long since I read
them--attributed to the New Critics.  But this is not really a problem, as we
have no shortage of such models, your own excellent work included.  Not that
many in the academy are paying attention anymore (I'll echo Boughn's "alas").
 
Anyway, that's my two cents worth of banalities from your local dimestore on
this Monday in the Year of Newt and His Company of Lizards.

Dear Sirs:
 
Here are the communiques.  As things are becoming black,
it's almost night.  The cynicism is amazed with the negation
of what is evident: the decision to seek a military
solution.  Us?  Well, but almost scratching at the sky.  The

Let's go.  Health and and a well-equipped boat to break

From the mountains of southeastern Mexico.
 
Subcomandante insurgent Marcos
Mexico, February 1995
 
P.S. Writing on February 15, 1995, sixth day of the retreat
(we recommend that it be read before each meal; it is an
excellent diet aid).
 
"The morning of the 15th we were going to drink our urine.
I say "we were going to" because we didn't do it as we all
began to vomit after the first swallow.  Previously there
had been a discussion.  Although all of us had been in
agreement that each person should drink his/her own urine,
Camilo say that we should wait until night came so that the
urine gets cold in the canteens, and we can drink it
thinking that it is a soda.
 
In defense of his position, Camilio argued that he had heard
on the radio that imagination made anything possible.  I
opposed the idea, suggesting that time would only make the
odor stronger, as well as mentioning that the radio had not
been recently known for its objectivity.  My other self
alleged that a time of rest could help the ammonia settle on
the bottom.  " It will be the adrenaline"--I said, realizing
strangely that the skepticism was my own and not my other
self.  Finally we decided to take a sip, all at the same
time, to see what would happen.  I don't know who began the
"concert", but almost immediately all of us began vomiting
what we had ingested, and also what we hadn't.  We were left
even more dehydrated, lying on the ground.  Like dunces,
stinking of urine.  I think that our image was hardly
soldier-like.  At these hours, before the sun comes up, a
sudden rain pelted us and alleviated our thirst and our
spirits.  With the first light of the sixth day we continued
walking.  In the afternoon, we came upon the outskirts of a
small village. Camilo went near to ask for something to eat.
 
He returned with a little fried pork, hard and cold.  We ate
it right there without any modesty.  In a few minutes the
cramps began. The diarrhea was memorable.  We were tied to
the foot of a small wooded hill.  A patrol of federal troops
passed by about 500 meters away.  They didn't find us
because God is grand.  The smell of shit and urine could be
smelled kilometers away..."
 
PS Reiterating their rebellion
They can bring more.  To do in all of the villages what they
did in Guadalupe Tepeyac, where, for each resident, child or
adult, they brought in 10 soldiers, for each horse a war
tank, for each chicken, an armored vehicle. In total 5,000
soldiers who patrol a deserted village and "protect" a whole
slew of dogs, in all of the areas, in all of the ranches.
The whole state of Chiapas full of soldiers..
 
On top of everything and everyone, the mountains of
southeastern Mexico will continue to be rebel territory
against the bad government.  This will continue being
Zapatista territory.
 
It will be forever...
 
P.S.  Clarifying and rectifying
 
It was not the EZLN who broke off the dialogue and
reinitiated the war. It was the government.
 
It was not the EZLN who feigned political willingness while
preparing a military attack and betrayal.  It was the
government.
 
It was not the EZLN who detained and tortured civilians.  It
was the government.
 
It was not the EZLN who murdered. It was the government.
 
It was not the EZLN who bomed and strafed communities. It
was the government.
 
It was not the EZLN who raped indigenous women. It was the
government.
 
It was not the EZLN who robbed and plundered the campesinos.
It was the government.
 
It was not the EZLN who betrayed the will of an entire
nation to find a political solution to the conflict. It was
the government.
 
P.S. Pointing out incongruencies in the investigations of
the Attorney General
If the "Sup" had received political and military training
from the Sandinistas, he would have already organized a
"pinata" with the recovered properties and he would have
expelled those who have criticized from the organization. If
the "Sup" had received training from the Salvadoreans, he
would have already given his weapon to Cristiani.  If the
"Sup" had received aid from the Russians, he would have
already bombed Chechenia, excuse me, Guadalupe Tepeyac.
 
In addition, what other guerrilla army, " of the millenium",
 
"fundamentalist", and directed by "white university people"
has carrried out the military actions that the EZLN has done
in January 1994 and in breaking through the military
blockade in December 1994? What other guerrilla force has
agreed to sit down and dialogue only 50 days after having
taken up arms?  What other guerrilla force has appealed, not
to the proletariat as the historical vanguard, but to the
civic society which struggles for democracy?  What other
guerrilla force has put itself aside in order not to
interfere in the electoral process?  What other guerrilla
force has convened a national democratic movement, civic and
peaceful, so that armed struggle becomes useless? What other
guerrilla force asks its bases of support about what it
should do before doing it?  What other guerrilla force has
struggled to achieve a democratic space and not for power?
What other guerrilla force has relied more on words than on
bullets?
 
Note: Please send the responses to the, supposedly
disappeared, CISEN so that it can help think in a "modern"
way. Yes, to the CISEN. The Attorney General is only the
pimp paying the ruling class.
 
P.S. Calling myself the "special investigator on the case of
the Sup" and inviting the national and international civic
society to be the jury and pronounce the sentence.
 
"Being such and such hour on such and such day, of such and
such month, in the current year, see before this P.S. a man
of indefinite age, between 5 and 65 years old, with his face
covered with one of those garments that appears to be a sock
with holes in it (and which the gringos call "ski mask", and
the Latin Americans call "pasamontanas--mountain passes").
Among the particular signs of a face, two enormous
protruberances emerge, one of which, which was supposedly
deduced after several sneezes, is the nose.  The other,
judging by the emanations of smoke and the smell of tobacco,
could be a pipe, like the ones used by sailors,
intellectuals, pirates and fugitives from justice.  Exhorted
to say only the truth and nothing but the truth, the
individual in question said that he was called "Marcos
Montes de la Selva", son of Old Anthony and lady Juanita,
brother to young Anthony, Ramona and Susana, uncle to
Tonita, Beto, Eva and Heriberto.  He of the voice declared
himself to be in full control of his physical and mental
faculties, and, without any pressure (other than the 60,000
federal soldiers who are looking for him dead or alive)
declares and confesses the following:
 
First. That he was born in the guerrilla camp called "Agua
Fria" in the Lacandon jungle, Chiapas, in the early morning
one day in August 1984. The man with the voice says that he
was reborn the first of January 1994, and born again,
succesively, the 10th of June 1994, the 8th of August 1994,
the 19th of December 1994, the 10th of February 1995, and
each day and each hour and each minute and each second since
that day up to this moment in which I am making this
declaration.
 
Second. That, in addition to his name, he has the following
aliases: "Sub", "Subcomandante", "Sup", "Supco",
"Marquitos", "Pinche Sup", "Sup son of a ...", and others
that the power of this PS Agent prevents from writing.
 
Third. He of the voice confesses that, since having been
born, he has conspired against the shadows which cover the
Mexican sky.
 
Fourth. He of the voice confesses that, before being born,
being able to possess everything in order to have nothing,
he decided to possess nothing in order to have everything.
 
Fifth. He of the voice confesses that, in the company of
other Mexicans, the majority Mayan Indians, they decided to
make a paper live up its words, a paper that they teach
about in school, which lists the rights of the Mexican
citizens and which is called, "The Political Constitution of
the United Mexican States".  He of the voice pointed out
that, in article 39 of this paper, it is said that the
people have the right to change the government.  Coming to
this point, the P.S., jealous of his right, ordered the very
subversive paper confiscated, and ordered that it be burned
with giving it a glance, and having done this, continued to
take the statement of the individual with the obvious nose
and the contaminating pipe. He of the voice confessed that,
not being able to exercise this right by peaceful and legal
means, he decided, together with his accomplices, (these
whom he of the voice calls "brothers"), to take up arms
against the supreme government and to shout "Enough!" to the
lie that, says he of the voice, rules our destinies.  The
P.S. could not help but be terrified in the face of such
unusual blasphemy, and was fixated on the idea of leaving
him without "a bone".
 
Sixth. He of the voice confessed that, put to choosing
between comfortableness and responsibility, he of the voice
always chooses responsibility.  This statement merited the
disapproval of the people present to this preparatory
statement and the instinctive reflex of the P.S. to put his
his hand on his wallet.
 
Seventh. He of the voice confessed that he has been
irreverent with all of the truths that are called supreme,
execept those that emanate from being a human being and that
they are, to declare clearly, dignity, democracy, liberty
and justice.  A murmor of disagreement ran through the Holy
Inquisition, excuse me, the office of the special
investigator.
 
Eighth. He of the voice confessed that they had tried to
threaten him, to buy him off, to corrupt him, to put him in
jail, and to murder him, and that they had not intimidated
him nor bought him off, nor jailed him, nor killed him (up
until now, he added, threateningly, to the Investigating
P.S.).
 
Ninth. He of the voice confessed that, since he was born, he
decided that he preferred to die before turning over his
dignity to those who have made lies and crime a modern
religion.  A thought that was so impractical earned a
cynical look from the people present.
 
Tenth. He of the voice confessed that, since then, he had
decided to be humble with the humble, and to be arrogant
with the powerful.  The P.S. added "irreverent" to the
charges that were being made against him of the voice.
 
Eleventh. He of the voice confessed that he had believed and
believes in human beings, in their capacity to try
indefatigably to be a little better each day.  He confessed
that, among the human race, he has a special affection for
the Mexican race, and that he had believed, believes and
will believe that Mexico is something more than six letters
and a underpriced product on the international market.
 
Twelfth. He of the voice confessed that he believes, firmly,
that the bad government has to be brought down by all means
and by all parts. He confessed that he believes that a new
political, economic and social relation has to be created
among all Mexicans, and later on, among all human beings.
These promiscious intentions gave shivers to the P.S.
investigator.
 
Thirteenth. He of the voice confessed that he will dedicate
himself to the absolute last second of his life, to
struggling for what he believes.
 
Fourteenth. He of the voice confessed that, in a small and
egotistical act, he will dedicate his last second of his
life to killing himself.
 
Fifteenth. He of the voice confessed that he was completely
bored with this interrogation.  This earned him a severe
reprimand from the P.S. Interrogator, who explained to him
of the voice that the case will continue until the supreme
government finds another tale to entertain itself.
 
After these confessions, he of the voice was exhorted to
spontaneously declare himself innocent or guilty of the
following series of accusations.  To each accusation, he of
the voice responded:
     The whites accuse him of being dark. Guilty
     The dark ones accuse him of being white. Guilty
     The authentics accuse him of being indigenous. Guilty
     The treasonous indigenous accuse him of being mestizo.
Guilty
     The machos accuse him of being feminine. Guilty
     The feminists accuse him of being macho. Guilty
     The communists accuse him of being anarchist. Guilty
     The anarchists accuse him of being orthodox. Guilty
     The Anglos accuse him of being Chicano. Guilty
     The antisemetics accuse him of being in favor of the
Jews. Guilty
     The Jews accuse him of being pro-Arab. Guilty
     The Europeans accuse him of being Asiatic. Guilty
     The government officials accuse him of being
oppositionist. Guilty
     The reformists accuse him of being ultra. Guilty
     The ultras accuse him of being reformist. Guilty
     The "historical vanguard" accuse him of calling to the
civic society and not to the proletariat. Guilty
     The civic society accuses him of disturbing their
tranquility.  Guilty
     The Stock Exchange accuses him of ruining their
breakfast. Guilty
     The government accuses him of increasing the
consumption of antiacids in the government's Departments.
Guilty
     The serious ones accuse of being a jokester. Guilty
     The adults accuse him of being a child.  Guilty
     The children accuse him of being an adult. Guilty
     The orthodox leftists accuse him of not condemning the
homosexuals and lesbians. Guilty
     The theoreticians accuse of being a practitioner.
Guilty
     The practicioners accuse of being a theorist. Guilty
     Everyone accuses him of everything bad that has
happened. Guilty
 
     Not having anything else to declare in this first
preparatory statement, the P.S. Investigator ended the
session and smiled imagining the congratulations and check
that he would receive from his bosses.
 
P.S. Talking about what was heard on February 16, 1995, on
the afternoon of the seventh day of the retreat
 
--And why don't we attack instead of retreating?--Camilo
threw at me in the middle of a hill, precisely when I was
concentrating most heavily on breathing and on not falling
into the ravine at our sides.  I didn't respond immediately,
I made signs that he should continue climbing.  At the top
of the hill we three sat down.  Night comes to the mountain
before it comes to the sky, and in the semi-darkness of this
indecisive hour in which light isn't the same, and the
shadows waver.  Something is heard, far away...
     I say to Camilo who is listening with attention.  "What
do you hear?"
     Crickets, leaves, wind-- responds my other self.
 
     --No--I insist--. Pay attention.
 
     Now it is Camilo who responds:--Some voices...very far
away...a boom--boom--boom...like a drum...from over
there...--Camilo points to the west.
 
     --This exactly--I tell him.
 
     --And?--intervenes my other self.
 
     --It is the civic society.  Yelling that there can't be
war, there has to be dialogue, that words should talk and
not weapons...--I explained.
 
     --And the boom-boom-boom?--insisted Camilo.
 
     --That's their drums. They are calling for peace. There
are many people, thousands, dozens of thousands, hundreds of
thousands. The government is not listening to them and is
confronting them.  We, all the way over here, we have to
listen to them. We have to respond to them.  We can not turn a
deaf ear like the government is doing.  We have to listen to
them, we have to avoid the war until there is no other
choice...
 
     --And then?--muses my other self.
 
     --Then we fight--I responded to Camilo.
 
     --When?--he insisted.
 
     --When they fall, when they tire. Then that will be the
black hour in which we will have to talk...
 
     --Fight--says my other self
 
     I insist: "We do everything for them. If we fight, it
is for them.  If we stop fighting, it is for them.  In the
end they will win. If they annihilate us, they will have the
satisfaction of having done everything possible to avoid it,
to avoid the war.  For this reason they rose up, and now
they are not being held back.  In addition, they have in
their hands a flag that they are responsible for.  If we
live, they will have the satisfaction of having saved us, of
having avoided the war and having demonstrated to us that
they are better and that they can handle the flag.  Whether
we die or live, they live and will become stronger.  For
them everything, for us nothing..."
 
     Camilo said that he preferred his version: "For them
nothing, for us everything".
 
 
 
     P.S. Reigniting his nocturnal delirium
 
     Forgetfullness, a faraway lark, is the cause for our
going around without face. To kill forgetfullness with a
little memory, we cover our chests with lead and hope. If,
in some improbable flight, our stay in the wind coincides,
you will take off so many clothes and mask of sweet trick,
and with lips and skin make the memory better, that of
tomorrow. For this reason, a message goes from the earth to
the concrete. Listen well!
 
     As an unperfect actor on the stage,
     Who with his fear is put besides his part,
     Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
     Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
     So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
     The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
     And in my own love's strength seem to decay,
     O'ercharg'd with burden of mine own love's might.
 
     O, let my books be then the elocuence
     And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
     Who plead for love, and look for recompense
     More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
     O, learn to read what silent love hath writ;
     To hear with eyes belonge to love's fine wit".
 
     Sonnets
 
     William Shakespeare. Sonnet XXIII
 
Good bye, amber lark, don't look for us under your flight.
Up above yes, where our pain takes us up, to the sun, where
hope rains...
 
P.S. Not being able to give anything on this birthday
 
Heriberto has a birthday on the March 5th.  They say he will
complete 4 years and start on his fifth.  Heriberto walks
the mountains, while in his home soldiers live and a tank is
on his patio.  The toys that a "Operation Toys" brought him
for the Three Wise Men's Day, are now in the hands of some
general or being analyzed by the Attorney General in search
of some secret organization.  Heriberto, as much as he
prepared for what happened the 10th of February (the
invasion of the federal soldiers), at the actual moment, he
left behind his best toy: a little car that Heriberto,
inside it, played at being a driver around the patio where
the coffee was dried.  They tell me that Heriberto consoles
himself saying that in the mountain his little car couldn't
go.  Heriberto asked his mom if he ever was going to have
his car again, and if the Sup was not going to give him
chocolates.  Heriberto asked his mom why the war from last
year returned, why his car was left behind--Why?--asks
Heriberto. His mom does not respond, continuing to walk with
the boy and the pain weighing on her shoulders...
 
P.S. Remembering and I recite from memory, verses from
Antonio Machado? which refer to distinct things, but which
are coming.
 
                              I
                     In the heart I have
                   the thorn of a passion
              I was able to pull it out one day
                 Now I don't feel my heart.
                     Sharp golden thorn
                  who will again feel you
                   in the stopped heart...
 
                             II
               At night I dreamed that I heard
                God yelling to me: Watch out!
                 later it was God who slept
                and I was yelling "Wake up"!
 
P.S. Bleeding unstoppably
                An injury I carry in my chest
                       Of bloody wheat
                    and there is no bread
                 to alleviate the desire...
 
The Sup at the top of a hill, seeing how the sun goes down,
in the west, a twinkle that is going out...

Subject: NPW: NEA cuts and race
 
Color-coded culture cuts?
by Kevin Cartwright
 
Congressional budget hearings on the National Endowment for
the Arts (NEA) opened in January to ominous forecasts of
NEA's demise as a vital funding source for the arts. The
political right delights in flogging the NEA for allegedly
promoting left-wing ideology and cultivating debased and
marginalized art that most Americans don't care about.
 
In fact, "the work that is controversial represents less
than 1% of the funding of the endowment," says Vanessa
Whang, fundraiser and program developer at La Pena Cultural
Center in Berkeley. "But for smaller organizations [the NEA]
is their lifeline. They're supporting the meat and potatoes
of being able to stay in business for groups like La Pena
that are working in communities of color," she says.
 
The NEA has an operating budget of $176 million, a minuscule
amount compared to the military budget or even to
allocations for military bands, which many have pointed out
exceed NEA funding.
 
Many community-based arts groups which serve minority
communities receive funding from NEA's Expansion Arts
program. If proposed cuts are enacted, this program could be
in danger.
 
Federal grants to arts groups and individual artists have
been reduced to $24 million, a decrease of $54 million from
last year. Though La Pena received a $30,000 grant this
year, Whang is concerned that cuts could cost jobs and
jeopardize La Pena's ability to offer a range of cultural
programs, classes, and events at low ticket prices (or free)
to people with few resources.
"La Pena and some smaller and mid-size organizations that
are working primarily in communities of color are going to
be hit really hard by this," Whang says.
 
The Galeria De La Raza opened in San Francisco's Mission
district in 1970, and has been committed to showing the art
of Chicano, Latino and indigenous cultures. Their NEA
funding accounts for 20% of their budget. The lack of
funding would severely affect how they approach programming
and the needs of the community. According to Liz Lerma,
Executive Director of Galeria, the cuts would undermine the
power of cutting-edge art.
"A lot of the dynamism that you find here comes from us
being able to present the art in a timely fashion, you know,
when something is happening we allow the artist to respond
to it essentially. We would be crippled in that effort,"
says Lerma.
 
"The politicization of NEA funding is rooted in the right-
wing efforts to silence opposition and further marginalize
communities of color," Lerma says. "Places like the Galeria
are known to show varieties of art that aren't afraid of
what the artists are saying. We support it. We're the forum
where it can be said," she adds.
 
Whang, Lerma and other cultural activists are collaborating
with the San Francisco Arts Democratic Club in an effort to
fight the cuts. At the News ' deadline, the club planned a
Feb. 18 town hall meeting to strategize and set up a letter-
writing and phone campaign. For info: (xxx) xxx-xxxx.

Subject:      Re: Close Reading
 
  Dear Michael--THough I know what you mean about "close reading" and its
  debased form (as in X.J. Kennedy intro to literature anthologies)...
  there's no need to associate it with "agrarian" in some pejorative way.
  We do not need some city-country division. If, for instance, there is
  to be some viable way of dealing effectively with culture, there's no
  point isolating ourselves against the "agrarian"--which can also be
  the "tenement migrant farmer" etc...Also, the hegemony of the "contextual"
  the "new historicist" reading in much "hip" avant-garde discourse that
  claims to be a reaction to "close reading" goes too far in the opposite
  direction--like Stephen Greenblatt talking about Renaissance sex-operations
  for 55 pages and then quoting one line in a Shakespeare play, and saying
  "A HA, now you know the meaning of it..." and of course the essay is
  allegedly and ostensibly ABOUT SHAKESPEARE...and though I believe some
  kind of fruitful "balance" can be achieved, the "cultural studies" aspect
  of literature seems to be a dinosaur now, and can only have any value
  if it's ASSUMED that "close reading" is instilled--thus, one generation
  of academics are teaching a younger one to unlearn the things they never
  learned (I speak as one who received an M.A. in english without having
  ever read Shakespeare, for instance), and then there's also the question
  that is seems the symbiotic relationship of GRADUATE and UNDERGRADUATE
  ENGLISH departments can be reduced to this--the undergraduates learn
  exactly what they're suppossed to UNLEARN in grad school....Chris S.

Dear Friends,
 
I would like to retract my earlier TEXT: "I am the only 2A's, an E, 2G's, an
L, an N, & a U Poet."
 
The AHP as a body has produced the first & only, to my knowledge, Authorless
TEXT. As virtual as they may be, their texts can either investigated in a
rather dull, petty, & ultimately uninteresting but gossipy way; the "search
for the author." Or, one can read these texts as the products of the
chat-line's collective poetic sub-something. . . .
 
Well, this is getting boring. There is work to be done, & I have my farm to
tend to.

>>Bill Luoma, how did you come to write _My Trip to New
>>York_? Is your work--as I'm reading it--predominantly
>>"speech-based"?
 
Gary,
 
My prose has lately been slouching toward speech and transparent narrative.
 I also do visual stuff, and am working on a sound poem, so make what you
will of that.
 
I appreciate your asking me how I wrote My Trip to NYC.  But the fact is I
dont know how I wrote it.  It just happened, as if I tuned in a certain radio
station in a certain cocteau movie.  When I re-read it, some of the sequences
continue to astonish me.  Like, please let me write like that again.  Is it
arrogant to say this?  I wish I knew how to get into the zone on a regular
basis.  Waffles?  But I remember that Shiva says there are too many variables
to formulate a guaranteed methodology.  And I agree  (what then?)  I can only
talk around its writing.
 
I was living in San Diego.  I visited my friends in NY and Providence that I
hadnt seen for years.  Jennifer Moxley had just started the Impercipient and
published Douglasses poem about the car:
 
if the car is broken,
& we cannot go to get it,
who will?
 
if the car is broken,
& no one can go to get it,
who will?
 
if the car is old & broken,
wounded like the street,
 
broken like the broken parts
of these our broken lives,
 
& we remain?
 
When I got back to San Diego, Scott Bentley wanted me to send him some
slides.  I was on unemployment so I had time to write.  I tried to immitate
Douglasses poem because I thought it was the greatest.  But I couldnt write
beautiful lyrics like Douglass.  I started again.  I described my trip so
Scott could see how his pals were doing on the east coast.  I had never
written about myself and friends before, so it was fun.
 
I remembered that Helena Bennett was dead.  When your mate dies, you lose
your keys, forget where youre going, cry in public, miss exits on the road,
have moments of aphasia and anemone.  The deadpan spacy voice I could feel in
my head got put down on paper long hand.  I could feel the
instances/scenes/slides I was remembering (to describe to Scott) as short
paragraphs.  I could feel that I loved my friends.  Thus the form was born.
 
I wrote 80 paragraphs in two days and revised for a few months.  I sent it to
Geoff Young at the Figures and he published it.

Subject:      Re: Close reading
 
Dear Chris:
 
I wasn't being pejorative, actually, being someone who, along with
Peter Quartermain, believes in the continued importance of teaching
the practice of something called "close reading", as in reading
closely. The "agrarian" in that list of attributes was a perhaps too
arcane reference to the fact that the originators of what came to be
called "The New Criticism" were originally known as the Southern
Agrarians. This group included Cleanth Brooks (still, in my books, one
of the most astute and careful readers I've encountered), Allen Tate,
Robert Penn Warren, and Laura Riding (yes folks, no jive).
 
They considered themselves "agrarians" in that they felt they
represented traditional, agrarian, humanist values in the face of the
degradations of urban, capitalist, commodified culture. Their theories
about "the poem" as a formal object reflected their desire to find an
uncontaminated space in which to locate those values. The later
contraction of those fundamentally conservative (and I do not use that
word here pejoratively, but rather descriptively) values into the kind
of mastery Keith Tuma (and via him Michael Palmer) refer to is an
interesting story, that has a lot, I think, to do with the
institutionalization of the American intellectual. But it's another
story.
 
Best,
Mike

We should look at community formation relative to the LISTSERV
phenomenon. First, let me say that anyone who participates is a
de facto member of this community; and maybe even full-time lurkers as
well. I imagine some (myself, sometimes) get into a routine of
subscribing and unsubscribing according to the general tenor of the
discussion threads, not to mention volume of mail, as James notes.
Some threads (Experiwhat?, Boy Talk,  Apex of the M, etc.) were at times
as satisfying as a good Monster Truck demo. I haven't a clue about that
Hokey Pokey business.
 
I suggest that self-restraint is the only kind of customization that is
possible here, otherwise people start to vote with their bozo filters.
After all, the object of the game is to create a climate that encourages
participation.
 
As for the subject of splitting the list, worse things have happened.
 
It would be nice if there could be some general agreement not to engage in
chain-jerking, personal attacks, or "reading" someone out of a discussion,
the rest will take care of itself. Or maybe we should just apply chaos
theory and see if we *can* quantify community after all.
 
Cheers,
 
Marc

Good points. In any case, I assume "agrarian" is this usage refers
mainly to those New Criticism poets who have been associated with
the term for several decades.
 
Without acting on the urge to drive out to the nearest hacienda to
bond with the first tenement migrant farmer within hugging distance,
it seems to me that much of the "city/country division" in American
poetry stems from a kind of urban arrogance that, unfortunately, has
been characteristic of some members of the poetry avant-garde
(of several ideological persuasions). For me, writers who obsess
on literature of "the coasts" are guilty of that kind of arrogance .
 
A slight digression:
Try arguing with an art critic/historian about the validity of
contemporary painting in small cities with active arts communities
and innovative artists (e.g., Cleveland, Baltimore, Austin, etc.).
Artists from these areas are punished both critically and economically
for such transgressions as refusing to move to NY/SF/LA....
A friend of mine who writes for _Art News_ once insisted to me that
writers and artists who remain in these "minor" communities are
perpetually discovering what has already been discovered, an
attitude that is ignorant at best. From where does he suppose most
"New York artists" originate. Does literary and artistic knowledge/
vision/accomplishment come into being only after exposure to
"major" communities? I don't think so.

talkin' bout my generation, I guess, but: re: close reading, and who
unlearns, supposedly, what they learned as undergraduates, and so on.
(I don't mean to rant but): after teaching poetry/theory grad courses the
last few years, I finally decided to cash in on a gathering hunch and
teach, at the grad level, the kind of course I sometimes offer at u.g.
level and that used to be offered all the time: "close reading" that is.
I'm having a great time (some students are, some probably aren't) but so
far the results are pretty staggering.  We're doing the course as a
workshop, in which a poem and its explication, xeroxed in advance, are
discussed concurrently.  And (to me) it's just staggering what the
generally bright and able students don't have a clue about and don't
(yet) by and large have much knack at all for doing.  Just on the very
basic level of poem as speech act or Burkean symbolic action; or when it
comes to thinking about trope as somehow functional in a reasonably
sophisticated way: it's a great big blank by and large (w a couple of
stunningly smart exceptions).  I dunno whether it was always that way
(that is, contra Richards, whether no matter how many classes everyone
takes basically 10% of the people have an ear and the other 90% can't buy
one) or not, but I suspect that not so much deconstruction & all as
cultural studies is partly responsible.  I don't mean it as a discipline
(or non discipline) so much as how it gets filtered into the brainpans of
the undergraduates who end up applying, at least, to Arizona, where the
students are quite good but it's obviously not Berkeley, say.  Even at
the next level up--reading the essays on poetry that come in to Arizona
Quarterly, say, it's really just themes themes themes.
So this doesn't continue to sound like only a dispeptic rant, I guess I'd
want to say that the course is a whole lot of fun (for me anyway), that I
intend to offer it every couple of years, and that I think the old
close-reading staple has pretty much disappeared from the u.g. curriculum
and needs re-instating.  But it really is astonishing to me, still, the
extent to which grad students in the course write essays/explications tht
have virtually nothing to do w wht I understand reading poetry to involve.
must be time to power down here.

DEFENSE OF INDIVIDUAL GRANTS
 
As many of you know, the main target of proposed rescissions to the NEA's
FY 95 budget are individual grants: $4m out the $5m targetted for cut-back
comes from that area.  In this regard at least, the rescission process
offers just a foretaste of what future appropriation battles will look
like.
 
If you have a cogent defense of individual grants, now is the time to air
it.  We will include any comments on this matter in future *FE* updates.

In-Reply-To:  <199503070606.BAA07861@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu>
 
This thread may have more relevance on the T-AMLIT list, or perhaps on
some other, but I have to agree with Tenney Nathanson that the
university's emphasis on theory & cultural criticism takes both
undergrads and graduate students away from close reading.  How crucial is
close reading to writers, to poets particularly?  The students I teach
who have most interest in close reading are those who take as many
creative writing courses as they can.
 
But the different types of reading -- pertinent to different types of
writing -- a "close reading" of works by most of those subscribing to
this list might not much resemble, task by specific task, a close reading
appropriate to poems written by those in that other, dominant,
not-precisely-parallel tradition (as can be found discussed, say, on the
CAP-L list).
 
But it could be that NT's point is that no matter the difference in
poetic ideology or practice, a critical reading strategy which involves
reading-with-a-purpose (i.e., to explore cultural or economical
conditions imbedded in various texts) may not _need_ to include close
reading strategies.  Reading for "pleasure," however, or reading to
"understand the author's meaning or purpose" -- those tasks do involve
close reading (no matter the poetics, I suspect).
 
The grad-level seminars I've been teaching the past two years make me
think students haven't learned much about close reading; but most find it
valuable to get an introduction.  Minds are malleable....

Gary, thanks for your posting asking:
 
> "Ira Lightman, "No Things But in Ideas," the work of

addresses, if & as it does, that very provocative title?"
 
The thing is having a number of theoretical and personal and aesthetic
enthusiasms/beliefs, and not being able right now to set them all in relation
in a complex formal structure, longpoem etc. So nothing will get worked out
or mapped in this poem, but "disparate" things (ie with unexplained
connections) will appear in the poem, in this case because the title was in
my head when the poem was going down on the page. So no go on the form of
this poem being shown to address the title, but perhaps a few remarks about
strains:
 
1) the title; I spent two years in New Zealand working by myself on the
prosody of the first seven Cantos of Ezra Pound; there is a music that
quite formally follows through (not free verse at all) *if* the words can
be read with the emphasis, investment, background reading and thinking and
feeling that I hypothesize Pound had. There are the equivalent too of
dilemmas and paradoxes, just as there would be in well-argued piece of
philosophical prose (musically monotonous), in this "music that quite
formally follows through". So "no things but in ideas" in the sense that
all objects, and musics, to me depend on seeing or meeting the composer
or a wonderful interpreter, or reading good texts about or by the author,
with huge empathetic imagination, so that one has a world of similar ideas
and emphases (the word "incest", for example, scans very differently
depending on your take on Freud). And then the pay-off; hearing the most
wonderful formal complexity, accepting the ideas in one's head in an act
of being the composer (intentionality!) that is not so just intentionaliy,
in the sense of "you can only get it if you agree with it", but *negative
intentionality*, like Keats' negative capability. Oh and maybe some of
the author's soul is left in you after....
 
2) specific poetic in this piece; my biggest influence is a painter and
muralist called Betty Schlesinger, from South London. She is the only
avant-garde muralist I know, in the sense that she works with the primary
weapon of the muralist, trompe l'oeil (mislead the eye), but where other
muralists do this by (thinking they are) misleading you into thinking there
is a mantelpiece on the wall or a window looking out onto a garden,
Schlesinger does this by taking the lines of a room and painting against
them eg a diagonal bridge painted around the corner of a room so that if
you look at it hard you can't see the right-angle; in other words, working
with people's unchallenged expectations that a wall in a house will always
have another wall at right-angles to it, or a door of such and such a
height or a room with a sloping ceiling will slope always in a particular
way. Her murals work with those expectations (like some avant-gardists
work with expectations of left-to-right reading across the page and tug
at them, Carla Harryman, for example) and tug at them. She uses her skills
as a representational painter (her canvases are usually still-life, which
"accounts" for her utter neglect by a London art scene) to do something
genuinely avant-garde, when so many lazy conceptualists with no
draughtsmanship abound.
 
3) I often read texts as trompe l'oeil, seeing other words within or
rhyming with the real words in the text; we don't know ourselves, perhaps
the mistake word or phrase was the real one.
 
4) In this poem there is a specific narrative line unfairly split often
in mid-word, sometimes for musical value, sometimes to open the text to
others and me to read "subconscious trompe l'oeil".
 
5) There's also a lot of very personal references eg to the subway stop
"Osterley" on the Piccadilly Line on the London Underground. The London
Underground has too much of a mythic status and too many connotations for
most readers to use it in other than a hidden and secretive way. The whole
poem is about flying from London to San Fransisco, seeing Osterley from
the plane, but that isn't needed; I was putting myself in at least two
frames of mind, one gives a music to those who know the personal and
theoretical ideas (as in my reading of Pound I think I did) and the other
gives a music to those who want to read it as flat surface (I hope).
Some of the words in the text don't resolve into a narrative at all, though,
of any sort.
 
6) It was basically an improvisation, leading to the fragment I nudged
the editor towards putting on the cover:
 
                me/an/in
                g = t-cells
 
This tends towards my favourite form: the mnemonic. Where lots of rhythms
and ideas flow into and out of the captured moment, just as a painting
selects a moment, suggests the past leading up to it, indicates in the
texture and light some of where it is all going. I wanted to say, as an
AIDS activist, how "me" is a thing, so needs an "an", and not a "the" as
the thing it is decided by different ideas, sometimes many at once. To
emphasis the "in", that we are all "in" this epidemic, whether HIV positive
or friends of a PWA or none of the above. And we are "in" some kind of
self, "it p ills self hood", and need to act energetically to see others'
constructions on us and counter-act. And also to figure us and parody us,
in the vision of medicine, as sums and algebra (and also to bring in some
maths, on a personal level, because I liked it at school and it was a major
boost of my self-esteem to be good at it, but is that "in" the poem or not,
doesn't have to be).
        I'm doing lots of mnemonic type paintings of words now, in homage
to Johanna Drucker, but I don't know that "me/an/in g = t-cells" worked
without all the other improv energy around it, personalising it, making
it less slogan-like, as I prefer to do mnemonics that aren't slogans. What
I do now is live these improvs in my head until I come up with a little
phrase or letter-cluster I want to paint.
 
Sorry to bore everyone else, but I wanted to answer you, Gary, in public
like you addressed me,
 
Best
 
 
Ira

  Right on, Mark, to hell with big city snobbery fascism, etc, etc....
  I mean even "cleveland," etc--is BIG compared to certain art communities
  not on the map.... But then i wonder if what you're talking about to some
  extent isn't already a done dea, i mean the "decentralization" of the art
  world---somebody wrote about there not being a SCENE any more in SF, and
  NYC is not THAT happening anymore (etc. etc.) and a lot of this has to do
  with MONEY, and JOBS and FEAR. And I myself wanna move to NYC soon i think
  (even though...) and I realize how the conservatives have been highly
  anti-city since the whites could afford to leave in the 50's and 60
' 's and up to now...and then I find "my people" more in a place like NYC
  than in the little town I grew up in (I went to a 10th year highschool
  reunion 5 years ago and saw most of my "hood" friends with their split-
  level babies and surbaban ties and potbellies and smug boring etc...or
  ) and so we RUN to the city in an attempt to find something where you
  DON'T NEED A CAR...Now, perhaps an unfortunate consequence of this then
  is defensive city snobbery. I too succumb to it (here in SMALLBANY--see
  what i mean)...I guess I consider the SUBURBS te big enemy....Once Jeff
  Hansen (who is a dear friend) said in a "POETICS BRIEFS" that the ego

  Best, CHris Stroffolino-----and sorry I SHOULD CHANGE THE TOPIC TO
  "TOWN & COUNTRY" as opposed to "CLOSE READING"--though the name of the

forgive me if i came in too late on this subject and missed important opening
salvoes (i just joined the list y-day) --but it seems that when people refer to
"close reading," they have in mind a very particular and historically
circumscribed set of concerns --not only foregrounding the materiality of the
text itself (words) but a certain vocabulary that is, indeed, inherited,
relatively recently, from the agrarians/new critics.  but there  has always been
"close reading" and an hermeneutic/exegetical/interpretive process --in the
sense of careful attention to the material structures of a work-- of one kind or
another --whether from a rhetorical (medieval) perspective or other --many
people read religious texts, the bible or koran, with a close attention that
would put prosodists to shame --and that there's no need to fetishize the kind
of close reading we learned in poetry classes as the only close reading that
enables intimacy and respect for a text.  much good cultural studies work --for
example, see daniel boyarin's writing on talmudic traditions --combines a close
and charged relationship with the structural/formal elements of a work with
broader concerns. that's all folks--maria damon

Subject:      cloze reading
 
The notion of close reading, parsing, fakes an ideological neutrality that
we've all come to know as a right-wing excision of the social because it
relegates the poetic act to an independent linguistic domain. This embrace
of the idea beyond the motivation of it is a close (cloze) reading - a cold
embrace. The fold, or moment of discovery, comes when we are not parsing
"The Idea of Order at Key West," the lay of the land/sea as described by a
resolute metaphysician. This is par - the task of close reading as an
encounter with the independent idea is equal to the face, or aspect of the
writing. It seems to me the real moments of discovery lie in the friction
between the practice of distilling and a poem that refuses, or complicates
that distillation through, for example, it's linguistic opacity and/or
cultural "position." In these contexts, close reading becomes an engagement
with that friction, the totality of languaging, the rubbing up against the
social, the motivation of the poem cutting in one direction, while the idea
of the language tumbles in another. It is here that there is a
determination of reading as a process of the social, because here our
belief in the distinction between language and motivation is tried. So, in
this trial, close reading becomes a passionate exchange of the social and
the linguistic; the linguistic becomes/is the social. Close reading in this
case is really close. We begin to parse, or closely read ourselves.

I don't get the connection between close reading, as a critical
interrogative practice and the implicit sense of right/wrong that Ed is
suggesting. I never met a reading of one of my poems that wasn't also a
misreading, and that "mis" has often been instructive. One is not after
"right" readings, I hope. But I would love to hear Ed or Don explicate
the authoritarian impulse they feel lurks behind the practice.
 
Similarly, David McA, I've always felt that the turn away from close
reading via theory was a diminution of theory itself. We're all
impoverished thereby.

I'm not so sure that *mis*reading is a very helpful term because it
suggests right readings. my own flip response here (I'm supposed to
be on the bus on the way to work) is simply that some readings are
more interesting than others, but I guess that's another whole
can of worms. I'll have to think some more on that. As for those
"students", well, they are why I have to catch the bus, but I'm not
sure what the connection is between "students" (presumably working
for grades) and close reading (presumably done for, well, call
it "pleasure"). Some of my students come up with admirably "correct"
and appallingly DUMB or should I say dull readings because there's
no delight in them. They read out of duty.
    But when I asked my original question, I was not thinking
pedagogy, I was wondering about my own reading practice -- which is
what I take to the classroom anyway -- and is, I'd say (or tries to
be), well, attentive.
I'm not entirely sure how "students" got into

        I'm happy Peter Quartermain raised the vexing question of close
reading, also one of the intersections between poetry and theory.
 
        In recent critical history, close reading took a nose dive when De
Man's wartime journalism was uncovered.  Deconstruction, I think, really
became close reading for most of us in the eighties.  Then, nobody I knew
(like Barbara Johnson) knew just what to do, except perhaps stop.
 
        I totally agree with Chris Stroffolino that post-deconstructive
tendencies tend to slight or ignore texts altogether.  I also think that
what I've been calling "textually specific" reading can be what Patrick
Phillips calls "a passionate exchange between the social and the
linguistic," one which overcomes the isolation with the materiality of
the poem.
 
        Yet if we continue to read, I don't think we can read just like Brooks,
Bloom, or de Man have been doing (when "misreading" began to be prized).
I'm now at work on a book tentatively called "Reading Poetry Now."  Have
any of you any suggestions about innovative readings, or reading
theories, out there?  I'd appreciate the help.

I've had a lot of interruptions reading the list lately, but I recall
that Tenney Nathanson made at least a tangential connection between close
reading or the lack of it in schools and the lack of an ear by students.
I know that I did a lot of close reading as a grad & undergrad in the
70's, but I don't recall that such practice helped much in hearing the
work. I also don't recall that the professors teaching such close
readings had much of an ear. Whereas listening to Monk & Miles (the
sounds & the silences), as well as Cage, and reading Pound & H.D. & later
Niedecker, & always Dickinson, helped a lot. Reading for pleasure -- is
that connected to close reading?

Subject:      close=intimate
 
It is interesting to see that Close-Reading can be such a hotly
contestable term. ( I suppose that this is a problem not of poetics at
large simply, but of a pedagogic situation for poetics.)
 
What are we talking about?  Reading, re-reading, reading again & again, over & over; reading
through, reading around & as Ron was saying mis-reading
(traduire=trahir)....putting  into relief  this & that for the sake
of the other, (the Other)....
 
Working with images (pictures &tc) what is often wanting is a good
stretch of time for what is on, in and around the image to come to
light.
 
Call this close-reading & spectres of "fascist" practices associated
now with the sins of New Criticism (oh boy! these -isms again)
appear!  Call it the slow careful detailed intimate & thoughtful
reading or viewing of a "work" or "piece" or "    ".
 
The question then arises how much of the extensive critical,
aesthetic, theoretical, historical literature in any of the arts is
grounded in this process?  Or even better, the question might be
how little.
 
I suppose that reactions posted recently to the close-reading
of  New Critics is grounded in readings of New Critical texts.  I
must "confess" that I thought F.R.Leavis's practical criticism
lectures were among the most exciting and stimulating events
of the 1950's in eng.lit. at Cambridge, because there was a
widespread lack of close-up attention to texts in respect of
"values".  Whether he was right or wrong was not consequential,
because he always insisted that questions of value were always
open-ended.  The usual alternative attention to texts was that of
annotation of detail. (But I suppose that is not what the objection
to "fascist" New Criticism is about, given the  American Agrarianism
argument.  But then I wouldn't want to take up the positions of
Michael Fried in relation to the values of Abstraction, while I
still admire the persistence and specificity of his critical writing).
 
There is a problem in "higher" education that stems from the
difficulty of close or intimate reading (I too like "Density" and "Difficulty" and
"Opacity" as points d'appui).  It is easier for students to sidestep
it and get rewarded for translating theory instead  (for many younger
academics)  or (in art history) to do iconography and annotation and
cataloguing  (for older academics).   There is resistance to taking
time and space for the specifics of a "work" from both directions
(new & old, so to speak).  Radical and Subversive is what it may well
be in 1995 to do close, intimate reading.
 
Call it perhaps "description", description of artworks.  "Describe a
picture", as an exercise for students, immediately raises the
problems barely sketched above.  It is probably impossible to specify
with any precision (the too many variables in communication
processes, Sandra Braman?) how to do this exercise.  Lack of specification
is interesting: it allows for students to determine specifications in the
actual occasion of writing.   (This kind of work is best carried out
as far as possible from university grade systems, because the
protocols for description are so unspecific).

Shiva confesses that precisely the reason she never studied literature
either as an undergraduate or graduate, the reason she isn't doing
literature as a professor -- though she persistently and passionately

being TOLD how to read....  Somehow, for this poet, it took the life out

Dear Gary,
 
Having returned from a few days off line and having now read your

But not what I was looking for."
 
I wasn't complaining because you were reductive.  My complaint was
that you were inaccurate and that I felt your characterizations
of other writers and presses in Minnesota had perhaps performed
a disservice to them.  The point I had hope to make was that
it's better to ask questions than to assume.  You elicit marvelous

Most of my teachers, I think, were excellent, so maybe my experience
differs from the norm.  Still, I did have some losers thrown in there,
and surely some of them were just being tendentious under the guise of
doing "close reading."  From such you wouldn't learn much of anything, of
ear or eye.  We've all had enough bad teaching to know what it's like to
feel stepped on.
 
The best writers, theorists or poets, have paid a
lot of attention to things -- for example, to the prosody of the first
seven Cantos.  "Close reading," the way I intended it, is just a subset
of "paying attention."  Reading page after page of "close readings" of
poems, on the other hand, wears thin pretty quickly.  Let's just read the
poems, I want to say!
 
In my earlier post I spoke simplistically of teaching strategies of close
reading pertinent to different types of writing.  That's not right.  We
certainly can learn strategies for reading, as we can learn strategies for
finding our way through the woods; but we can't know in advance the
"type," if there is such a thing, of a piece of writing.  We really do
have to read it, I guess.
 
I had tried to suggest by using "scare-quotes" that I understand "reading
for pleasure" to be a complicated if not illusory notion, but yes, as a
practical matter, people who read poetry frequently will tend, I think,
to read it carefully.  That doesn't mean that everyone is open to
poetries which do things differently from what they like to have done, or
what they are used to liking.  Pound's problem with Whitman may have been
that Pound didn't see carefulness in Whitman's work.  Or maybe he just
didn't like it and so couldn't read it carefully.
 
And now I'll tiptoe back to the shadows..

  I just joined this list last week, and the first messages I saw led me to
belive the discussion would soon turn to crop rotation.  I was relieved when I
saw the posts about close reading,  then disillusioned when I wasn't taking the
time to read most of the posts!
        My background in poetry is severely limited...(read: they made me write
haiku and limerick in grade school) and find myself almost overwhelmed at the
content of my first undergrad poetry class.  When I first started reading for
the course, I had no choice but to slow down and try to immerse myself in the
poems, reading closely (almost drowning myself).   There have been many times
when I instinctively wanted to "just read the poem" but it would all just turn
into a jumble of words.  For comfort, i would often trun to Dr. Seuss and read
aloud.  Chanting "Fox in Socks" while stomping around a dorm room can be very
liberating and soothing when Olson becomes frustrating.
 
Let's just read the poem!  -i want to say it to, but it gets me nowhere.

1.
Confusions of terminology: "close reading" v. intimate reading
as if theory and 'to read' can nae share the same bed.  And
deconstructions be damned, there is not a spirit of MIS-READING
(in the academy anyway) despite the prevalence of misreadings there.
 
2.
Fact is "close reading" as method gallops toward singularity,
imperial resolution of the chord and production of the cadence.
So to Charles A., if only "close reading" could be for pleasure.
How would we name it?
 
3.
Within the hallowed halls if prophylactic theory promotes
safe texts and declining intimacy, our loneliness may not
be quelled through explication.  Brooks and Warren are
at peace and the students don't read, agreed, but the
spirit of "close readings" climactic S&M mastery over
the poem lingers.

"I can't read this poem; I don't understand it at all."
 
Sure if anecdotal evidence of an authoritarian effect
of close readings ethic of closure.
 
5.
Good to talk about the "pleasures" of "textually intimate"
readings. Of course the risk of accumulating first a mass
and then a theory.
 
In fact to talk so (as some have begun to do)
would perhaps bridge the gap (an imagined gap
as Ron Silliman (will the real Ron please stand up)
demonstrates in various theoretical yet intimate
readings in _New Sentence_) between the two
threads on this list and between theory and
"just reading the poem."

Just Do It?

Pleasure this week of hearing Ric Caddel (from NE England)
read and give a reading of Bunting, an intimate reading
complete with overhead projector that gave intimate
elucidation, made it possible to hear with the ears
 
7.
Suppose the theory monolith has turned the academy's ears
away from particulars of reading, strayed from the text
ye little lost lambs; causal--coincincident correlation with
with the fading of poetry (however read, misread, or unread-but-
theorized in the past) in general from the sanctified syllabi?

Charles ("Alexander"):
re re close reading and ears ("they fling their speech by means of it" &
etc?):
agreed, very much, that courses in close reading don't teach ear
possession (which I think I said or meant to say): I dunno whether I
learned my poetry ear at Monk's knee (though Wallace Shawn has a great
Monk story) or not, or whether, finally, you did--that may be a
romanticized account--but I do agree I didn't learn mine in grad school.
Going to grad school I instead felt by and large that those professing
didn't have much to teach me since I had developed my ear by writing (and
reading, in a non-academic contxt--Cantos on way to teach elementary
school on long subway rides to Brooklyn w refugees from the all night
Third World Club etc etc--though some notable exceptions, re different
KINDS of poems I wasn't equipped to hear having cut teeth or whatever on
Olson's earnestness--so mannerism had to be TAUGHT.  NEVER the less
sitting there in classroom with both 1) PhD students whose ears are full
of lead, AND have never been taught even the most rudimentary elabling
terminology for poetry explication (strange but true) AND w CW students
(MFA) some of whom are very good poets BUT, I continue to be intrigued by
the notion that in some basic way I might get some/several of them by
term's end to be seeing/doing something they are not doing yet.
and I guess here wd be the gist: if I can't do THAT, then what on earth
am I doing at the more "advanced" levels talking about Ashbery and
Baudrillard, or Charles B and Benjamin, or whtever I think I do: I mean
they are then simply not operating on a level where what I take for
granted as enabling details are even within their perceptual pardon the
expression universe.
 
meanwhile, having helped me teach a course here (there; where: Tucson) a
few years ago, you would I hope exempt my ear from general
professorial
ineptitude as I would exempt yours from whatever.  Or we could play
Duelling Ears?

meanwhile a VERY hearty assent to Ron Silliman's assertion or whatever that:
 
                          But I would love to hear Ed or Don explicate
the authoritarian impulse they feel lurks behind the practice.
McA, I've always felt that the turn away from close
reading via theory was a diminution of theory itself. We're all
impoverished thereby.
 
I'd add that the turn away from close reading has an authoritarian aspect
to it as well....

was I the one who brought students into it?  Sorry if so, I guess; am
busy teaching a close reading course to grad students for first time is
why, I guess.
but: the sort of non-academic or non-instructorish obsessive weird
hovering over details of a text. P. Quartermain, is just what I had in
mind by bringing students in: whatever I think it is I did sitting on
subways as a would-be writer reading Pound and Olson obssessively, has
NOTHING (almost) to do w what any of my students do, so far, when they
read poems and write on them, in the sense that their habits of attention
by and large are incredibly clotted up w Big Ideology questions--or
perhaps as non-writers mostly getting weened or warned in the academy of
the 80s-90s they are being offered a whole set of questions which while
meant to supplement close reading skills are instead replacing them
wholesale (cf. Kenner on EP and foibles of presumed "classical education"
as background "which he proceeded to modify" in ABC & etc.).
anyway I was just responding to I don't anymore remember whose suggestion
that close reading was authoritarian, w the suggestion or perception or
grouse that dealing w students makes me feel just the reverse: that
quirky attention to quirky details would in fact be whatever the
non-twelve-step word for "enabling" used to be.....

Subject:      more on close reading
 
        In a lecture I once heard on tape, a terrific Rutgers University left
political theorist, Stephen Bronner, talked about artworks as having
"internal dynamics" and "external dynamics," both of which deserve
consideration. He attributed the phraseology, which I have found really
helpful, to a contemporary German philosopher whose name I'd have to look up.
 As I understand it, the major critique of New Criticism's way of close
reading is that it too often ignored the external dynamics of poems--the
relationship of texts to important matters (historical events, human lives,
political ideologies, etc.) outside the text.
        In so doing, the New Critics priveleged certain poetic elements (e.g.
textual ambiguity and indeterminacy), and unfairly marginalized others (e.g.
more determinate explorations, often radical explorations, of the social
world). In *Repression and Recovery*, Cary Nelson does a good job of looking
at poetry from the first half of the 20th century that was marginalized by
New Critical standards, without denying the quality of the poetry which New
Critics championed. It seems to me that, by considering both internal and
external dynamics, it becomes easier to talk about the literary value, as
well as the radical potential, of a wider range of poetic styles.

   Another related issue it seems Peter Quatermain and Sandra Braman and
   Charles Alexander (and others probably) to this question of reading
   and teaching is what can be called the issue of "breadth" over "depth"--
   Increasingly, it's becoming obvious that, although I certainly do not
   wish for a narrow and restrictive canon, that as a teacher the idea
   of teaching less poems (or whatever) or more SHORTER ones probably is
   more effective FOR ME (if not for everyone) in the classroom...Last
   semester i spent a week and half on one Ashbery poem and people would
   have most likely got not nearly as clear an understanding had I devoted
   that time to say 5 or 6 of his poems. I also devoted a whole class to
   a very short Weiners poem and another one to a very short Fanny Howe
   poem (etc. etc.). Some say this is irresponsible, and though i do not
   wish to simply say that reading 23 books a semester is irresponsible,
   I do hope that such academics allow room for people like me to keep
   our jobs--though what we do may seem "claustrophobic"..Chris Stroffolino

ok, i'm gonna be persistent and once again recommend that dissertation i
mentioned to those of you who are sweating out the implications of close
reading (which i sweat out myself):  margaret a. syverson, "the wealth
of reality: an ecology of composition" (university of california at san
diego, 1994)... syverson is attempting to take into account factors that
reach *beyond* the individual (i.e., the individual reader, writer, text)...
 
so from the diss., p. 31:
 
We need to discover *who* and *what* are the agents interacting in an
ecology of composition; how these agents organize themselves into a more
or less coherent whole---a word, a sentence, a poem, a literary genre,
a collaborative writing group, a movement such as "romanticism" or
"modernism"; how they situate themselves; how they interpret their
environments; and how they use their interpretations to engage in
purposeful activities and interactions.  And specifically, we need to
better understand how composing systems are *distributed, embodied,
emergent, and enactive* across physical, social, psychological, temporal,
and spatial dimensions.
 
anyway... though syverson's rhetoric may strike some of you as functionalist,
fact is the strength of her READINGS (close? intimate? or distant? systemic? or
both? etc.) of (again) reznikoff, a collaborative student essay, and a flame
war convince me that there is something valuable in her 'approach'...

Tenney, you are absolutely right to take me to task. In some sense I
learned ear from father reading poetry to me, and from constant reading,
with a sense of sounding, from an early age. Yes, Monk helped, as did
various other sources, but most likely I could never have heard Monk
without having heard much else before. My guess is there's some strange
sources that went into this ear, including southern baptist preaching,
Tennessee Ernie Ford (a paternal favorite) & more.
 
Yes, I exempt your ear from criticism directed at the professorial realm,
although I exempt it after hearing your poetry & hearing you talk about
poetry informally over the years -- I can't entirely remember if concepts
of sounding and hearing came up in the class I helped you teach (my
couple of hours against your dozens of hours in that class, which I
enjoyed, and which, I remember, had a few ears in it).
 
Merton Sealts (Melville critic) oversaw my graduate teaching experience,
and commented that he thought what I did best for the students was read
poems aloud. I was shocked to think that other beginning level (this was
a freshman sophomore intro to lit class on 19th & 20th century lit -- one
century each semester) teachers (grad & faculty) did not do this.
 
        all best,

Subject:      History of Close Reading
 
Like many others, I did encounter "close reading" as a shared
presumption amoung the critics who are lumped together under "New
Criticism." It seems to me that the most important document that
encouraged "close reading" was I. A. Richards's PRACTICAL CRITICISM.
For Richards, this was a revolutionary and experimental way to
proceed--he gave copies of poems to Cambridge University students, or
attendees at his elctures, who were supposed to know a lot about
poetry. He found that many could not look at a poem and see what was
there in front of them. He found that the elite were not very bright,
unable to talk about a poem unless they already knew something about
the poet and had learned the right things to say.
 
Richards's experiment paralleled the teachings of T. E. Hulme and
Pound, the emphasis on the sharp, clear, image. Later, along came all
the careful explications of poems; Donne was read with understanding
by many people for the first time in hundreds of years. To read Donne
you have to keep your nose to the page.
 
After neing trained in this "New" thing, I discovered that the French
had been doing it in their lycees and universities for years. It was
known as explication de texte.
 
But to learn to read poetry this way makes it almost impossible to
read poetry that requires that the reader submit to a vague
evocativeness. For example, you have F. R. Leavis's famous demolition
of Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind. " You cannot read Shelley that
way. You have to read Shelley as if he were at least part Language
Poet. That is even more true of certain poems by Rossetti, William
Morris, and Swinburne. You have to loosen up. One cannot study clouds
with a microscope. The same is true of good Language Poetry. And of
many French Symbolist poems. Gerard de Nerval and much Mallarme.
Poetry can be many things, but vague evocativeness has been out of
fashion for a long time, perhaps because a hundred years ago there
was entirely too much of it. Funny how at the same time there was too
much overt didacticism--which the New Criticism also disdained, and
which the Beats and the anti-war poets of the sixties and seventies
brought back in.
 
or so it all seems to me

in the composition studies vein, and again, methinks, pertinent to this
question of close reading/pedagogy, i recommend the following:
 
derek owens, _resisting writings (and the boundaries of composition)_
(southern methodist up, 1994)...
 
derek's book is the only one i know to situate writing instruction over
and against work by h.d., cage, stein, s. howe, olson, davies, duplessis,
brossard, etc... the pluralism he calls for is, imho, a welcome relief

  panels and their chairs to be announced. The conference will thus
  begin on the morning of Thursday, June 1st.  We're in the process
  of notifying those whose papers have been chosen for a panel. We're
  now working out the scheduling of panels and other conference
  events, and we'll publish a conference/festival programme when we
  have these details worked out.  I'll post the programme information
  on this list at the same time.  Inquiries can also be sent to me at
  cwatts.sfu.ca.  If you have sent us a proposal (and you're wondering
  what happened to it), we should be able to let you know whether or
  not it has been accepted for a panel in about a week's time. Please
  be patient: the process of selecting panelists has been complex and
  lengthy, but some remarkable panels are coming out of it.

Subject:      close reading
 
I've thoroughly enjoyed the postings of the last several days.  I
find the list taking more and more of my time, but I am learning and
engaged.  Thanks to all.
 
When I was at the conference in Louisville, it was great to meet a
number of you that I'd had only known via e.
 
Of the current discussion, probably winding down?, on close reading,
I wanted to raise a related issue.  Peter had asked what would be the
opposite of close reading.  Inattentive reading?  Non-intensive
reading?  As others have pointed out, the allegedly conservative
nature of close reading has to do with its institutionalization via a
textbook:  Understanding Poetry.  (It's my mpression, that Jed
Rasula's forthcoming? just released? book will discuss this history.)
In my opinion, recent theory "advances," particularly those stemming
from deconstruction, have, in a different context, reiterated "close
reading" methodologies, but with much greater play and with different
metaphysical stakes.
 
But the issue that I would like to raise is the relationship of close
reading to theme-based reading.  It seems to me that much close
reading ultimately gets down to a process of unification of the
explanation of the poem by means of a thematized understanding.
While much (most? all?) newer/innovative/experimental (take your
pick) poetries have to one degree or another overthrown such habits
of unification and closure, many discussions of poetry end up
defending "new" poetries as having rather traditional modes of
meaning (as theme).  As various of y'all have pointed out, cultural
and contextual readings DO lead in different directions (and sometime
away from a close consideration of that great new critical polestar,
the text itself).  But even so, especially in the domain of the
multicultural, many readings boil down to assertions about "content"
(a close cousin of "theme").
 
In one of my poems in Doublespace, I had written that to be
"thematized is demonized."
 
Is close reading inevitably tied to "theme"?  Is "thematizing"
inevitably associated with retro modes of mastery--a kind of
strip-mining of the text?
 
More later.

>From a student's point of view...reading one or two shorter poems and
discussing them for an entire class (or more) can be much more effective than
parsing longer works.  Although part of this is because I started as an
engineering major and have an attention span accordingly...i find it easier to
become intimate with a shorter work, especially when the author or style is new
to me.  After I get a couple pages into a poem i start to remember less and
less, and have more trouble discussing and understanding the discussion of the
work.

A message some of you may not have seen.  Gabrielle
 
Tell me if I'm steaming up the airways...
 
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I'd like to share with all of you a letter I received this week. I wonder if
 you will find it as disturbing as I did.  Because of my participation in the
NEH Summer Seminars for Teachers (I studied William James' _Varieties of
Religious Experience_ at FSU last summer), I'm on the NEH mailing list, and
this week I got a letter from NEH which said, in part, the following:
"In recent testimony before the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee
former Chairman of the NEH William J. Bennett singled out the Summer Seminars
for School Teachers as an example of one of the ways the NEH has had 'a
deleterious effect on our culture.' This criticism was unexpected. Nothing we
have seen in the program's thirteen years of existence had suggested that
these seminars were anything other than successful by any measure."
 
The letter went on to ask former seminar participants to comment on the
validity of the criticism based on our experience. It also included the text
of Mr. Bennett's comments on the subject, and those are what I really want
you to see, since you may not have been aware of them. Mr. Bennett, by the
way, is also the author of the bestselling _Book of Virtue_. Here is what he
had to say about the seminars in a general attack on NEA and NEH:
 
"...how could the two Endowments hope to serve a larger civic role when they
have not improved the quality of the arts and humanities since 1965? There is
no question in my mind that things have gotten much worse in these realms
during the last three decades.. Some of the dominant movements that have
swept through the arts and humanities world include the radical nihilism of
post-modern art; homosexual and lesbian self-celebration; Marxism;
neo-Marxism; radical feminism and multiculturalism; deconstructionism; and var
ious manifestations of political correctness.
"When I was chairman of th National Endowment for the Humanities, at my
direction the NEH staff, in order to counteract some of the modish projects
that were swamping NEH, devised a summer program where high school teachers
would devote themselves to the study of a single great work of philosophy,
literature, or history. The program worked admirably the first year ...[but]
by the third it was obvious that this program was going the way of all the
others. The books were being Marxised, feminized, deconstructed, and
politicized. High school teachers, far from being exposed to "the best which
has been taught and said in the world" (in Matthew Arnold's phrase), were
being indoctrinated in the prevailing dogmas of academia."
 
Among other things, I resent the implication that high school teachers, some
of the best educated and, frankly, most opinionated people I know, can be
unwillingly "indoctrinated" into anything in a few weeks of classwork. Further
more,  I think that Bennett has a naive view of culture if he believes that
encounters with  the "dominant movements of thought" of one's milieu  can or
should be avoided by thinking people. The Declaration of Independence is a
product of a "dominant movement" of eighteenth century thought, for God's
sake! And, while one would probably not want to adopt any of them as the
whole of one's philosophy of life, and one might indeed have valid grounds
for rejecting their theoretical bases, the movements he mentions, such as
multiculturalism, gay self-celebration, and feminism, have contributed much
to humanizing our culture and have produced _some_ excellent scholarly work.
 
I think a valid case could be made (in terms of the proper role of
government, for example)  for the dropping of federal funding for NEH and
NEA, but the idea that such funding should be discontinued because of the dele
terious effects of those agencies' programs on our culture is ludicrous.
People and cultures are nourished, not diminished, by knowledge and the
challenge of new ideas and fresh thought.

Subj:   RE: Lobbying for the NEH/NEA ...
 
I'm writing in response to the question of why funding the NEA is important.
 I am a poet, and have been a recipient of NEA money in several different
ways during the course of my career.  I am working class, the first of my
family to go to college out of high school (my father did go to college
nights over the course of 15 years, and finally got a degree the year I
graduated from high school).  People in my community mostly worked in
factories or in the trades.  When I found myself writing poetry, it was not
out of an academic tradition, but rather out of the desire to tell stories
that I could not find in the literature, stories of working class people.  My
heritage is mixed blood, French-Canadian and Abenaki.  Again, not found in
the literature.  My writing is not a matter of fashion or aesthetic play, but
has to do with cultural survival, of being represented in the literature.
 
My training as a poet was not in MFA programs, but in the community, and with
the generosity of older poets such as Etheridge Knight and Sam Cornish -
poets who were working in the communities, sometimes receiving some funding
from the city/state that dribbled down from NEA sources.
 
I worked for several years as a writer-in-residence in public schools in
Massachusetts.  What does that mean, exactly?  I taught three or four
creative writing classes a day, in programs that lasted from one day to
several months at one site.  I did readings of my own work and that of other
contemporary poets, bringing poetry as a living tradition into the classroom,
reading poets who were writing out of the students' own communities, latino,
african-american, arab-american, Native American, Asian American, as well as
poets from the Anglo tradition, and poets in translation from all over the
world.
 
It was important to students that I was a real person in the community,
telling stories about my own community and life.  When I was a child, no one
ever told me that my stories were important, worthy of literature.  I know my
example encouraged students to see their own lives and stories as important,
as well as introducing them to the vitality of poetry, and encouraging their
skills as writers.  Students in my workshops were drawn from all populations,
not from honors or "gifted" programs, and teachers were often amazed (though
I was not) at the writing done by students with fair or poor academic
records.  Every residency also included teacher workshops, where I shared
ways of teaching poetry and creative writing, and introduced teachers to
contemporary poetry they were not familiar with.  These artist-in-residence
programs were largely funded with money from the NEA.
 
In 1990, I was awarded a Fellowship from the Massachusetts Artists
Foundation, a $10,000 award.  This was funded largely by NEA money.  This
award allowed me to take the time needed to finish my first book of poetry,
which was accepted for publication by a small press that receives, you
guessed it - funding from the NEA.
 
With a book out, I was eligible to apply for a Fellowship from the NEA.
 Individual Fellowships are granted to artists in the amount of $20,000,  and
in 1993, was awarded a Fellowship from the NEA.  The award gave me the time
needed to work on a second book of poetry, which will be out this spring.
 The award has also been seen as a credential, and I with that and my
publication record, I have begun teaching on the college and university
level.
 
Without NEA funding, I would have done next no work in the schools - I simply
wouldn't have been able to afford it. (As it was, the most I made as a
writer-in-residence during the years 1985-1992, working four to five days a
week from early October to June, was $12,000  - well under the beginning
salary of public school teachers - and I was considered one of the busy and
successful artists in the program.  This of course, is before taxes and
without any benefits.  I would say the community was getting it's money's
worth and then some.  It's important also to understand that all money
received by artists is considered and taxed as regular income, so those
$20,000 dollar grants actually amount to approx $13,000.  When you see the
figures allotted to the arts remember they are highly inflated by these
omissions.)  Without NEA funding it would have taken me much longer to get my
first book in print, if indeed, I did it at all.
 
The impact of a Fellowship in the arts is more than just monetary, it is a
great affirmation of the importance of one's work.  As the arts are so
undervalued in our society, it is crucial to have one's work affirmed.  This
is especially true for the beginning artist, but is true for artists
throughout their career.  Poets are not generally paid for writing their
poetry.  They're paid for teaching writing, doing readings, teaching
literature, and sometimes though rarely, for editorial work.  Receiving a
fellowship is one of the few times when a poet/writer/artist is told: just do
the work.  That is invaluable.
 
For a working class artist, who does not automatically have the support of a
university environment, the NEA support is crucial.  For marginalized
communities, who are by definition under-represented, the NEA support is
crucial.  Many of the small journals that are publishing some of the most
vital writing going on in America are NEA funded.  Literary writing has been
largely pushed out of the trade publishers.  Without NEA funds, many small
presses would fold.  If you care about literature, you should care very much
about NEA funding.
 
The move is to push all funding into private foundations.  This system moves
money away from the working class and marginalized communities, to where it's
least needed.  It encourages a good ol' boy system of grant-giving. (I knew
no writers on the panels of any funding organization that has given me moeny,
so I know it is possible to be funded without being part of a good ol' boy
network.) Public funding is crucial.  The benefits do not end with the
individual artists, but reverberate throughout the community.
 
I hope others on the Net will share stories of how NEA and NEH funding has
effected them, programs they've been a part of, or know about, etc.  Please
forgive the haste with which this note was written, as I'm doing it on line.

"External dynamics" is perhaps a more expressive way of referring to what
most of us have been calling "context" for lo thesemany years.  I heard
Cleanth Brooks years ago stand up at an English Institute meeting at
which the New Criticism was being slammed, and say strongly if in a
rather quavery voice that it had never been his intention, or that of
anyone he knew, to ELIMINATE considerations of biography, history, etc.,
(that is, context, or "external dynamics").  They merely wished to call
fresh attention to the specificities of the language(s) of poems, since
those were being badly neglected.
I very much like the notion of close reading as simply a subset of paying
attention.  Anything can be TAUGHT tyrannically, but there is nothing
INHERENTLY tyrannical in being urged to be more aware.  On the contrary.

Subject:      Intimacy and intimations of a micropoetics
 
1a. Close reading, closet reading, closet reading, closed reading. Do
we impale texts or are they, constituted as texts, offered within a
defintion of closure, as closed?
 
2a. Galloping toward singularity but for a single "reader," no? Is not
the singularity (or single array of possibilities) particular to this
reader and only trots to "resolution" when a singularity is imposed on
others? As to pleasure, it is true in fact that tidying up is a
pleasure to some. Does the text differ from a disorderly kitchen?
 
3a. Yes, possibly the pressure of history. Hallowed halls, etc., have
taken their toll and do cast their monolithic shadows by restricting
textual terrain. Does close reading equal explication?  The former is
a kinder phrase but carries the tenor of the latter. Is it my
schooling? Did anyone get graded on explication? Does this mean there
is a right answer? Time for a little alto?
 
4a. Maybe not an ethic of closure but a fear of elevation? Is not any
"formal" writing elevated? If it's not, "Hey, buddy, can you spare a
rhyme," then what is the entry point for someone not conversant with
the conventions of the elevation? Walk for ten minutes then rest
five...
 
5a. The mass _does_ turn to theory and this perhaps is the most
difficult moment. (Some might say after theory it continues to a
consumer product.) But this is not "theory" as a district attorney (we
are speaking about law here) would use the word rather the fear of
imposed consent. But do not our means of production offer a route out?
Or am I under a delusion?
 
6a.  At the reading thinking - this was a break away from what
constantly overwhelms me: daily work - "What I need to hear is some
elevated language." (Also dialect.) And boy did I need to hear some
elevated words. It _is_ elevated: physically, of course, there is a
stage - in this case a podium. But the reading voice offers words that
are _set_. That is, written in some other frame of place and activity,
transported, and delivered as if encased, framed, "on the crispest
sheet of white paper," I think I noted. Setting up the dilemma perhaps
instantly.
 
7a. Most probably that the monolith has penetrated through original
texts to secondary and the teriary. For the syllabi of the lambs a
lullaby. If poetry were to fade from the academy should it not be
carried on by word of mouth? Is _any_ comment on text theory? Or
close?

Subject:      Re: Form
 
I really liked Bill Luoma's description of his compositional process when
writing My Trip to NYC.  I'd never heard of this work, but I'll be on the
lookout for it from now on.  That sense  of the wonderful accident, followed
by the fear one will never be able to repeat the moment; not knowing how it
happened, the feeling if one only knew it could be repeated, but then knowing
that each new text creates each own success story as it were;
unreproduceability part of the uniqueness of the text, its genius--don't mean
for this to become blather, but the uncertainty Luoma describes struck me as
exactly right, or exactly my own experience.
 
I'm a fiction writer, so-called, but very influenced in my writing process by
Olsonian "field" notions, every moment in the writing a new decision in a
continually revised field, ever reformulating itself with each new decision.
 Yeah, when it works, there's nothing like it, but it also leads to a lot of
garbage.  But it's the way I write, I can't do it any other way, a fact which
has come clearer to me as I've been working on a so-called novel.  I tried to
figure out a plot, even if just to get me another step into the book.  But I
found as soon as started trying to follow it, I'd mess it up.  Intentionally.
 
 
In prose, there's the example of Poe, who said that everything should be
figured out to the least little detail before ever setting pen to paper.  I
used to think Poe was making it up, perversely creating a counter-myth to
prevailing romantic theories of composition.  I don't think so anymore (about
Poe) but it's still a very foreign method to my own.  I get too bored with
just filling in the blanks of a pre-planned piece.  Nor do I think lively
writing can be accomplished unless there's a sense it's renewing itself all
the time, turning over and over again.
 
I forget who said it, but I've also found oulipo-style formally rigorous
experiments engender work well.  Again, at times.  "Either it works or it
doesn't," as I seem to recall Spicer saying somewhere.  But knowing you only
get so many lines here, so many there, and letting that become something that
hadn't been there before is a nice way of having constant and variant, that
play between which can be fruitful.
 
Now, in this "novel," I am working one episode at a time.  I have a loose
idea of where I'm going, but want no more than that because when I do, like I
said, I fuck it up.  I'm also reading a lot, letting ideas or even just
images set me off.  I remember hearing once (it may be apocryphal, and I'd
like to be corrected by someone with better information) that in Olson's
library, volumes would have copious notes, starting in the beginning and up
until a certain point, where the marginalia would just stop. Presumably this
is where he'd start writing.  I'm committed to a long form on this work
though, and its tru I do have some tricks I'm keeping around for later (but
it's also true they might not fit; they're in the field as I see it now, but
may be abandoned later).  I'd like to hear from people who have written
things that couldn't be completed in one sitting, or even a couple --
extended works -- yet are committed to a similar improvisatory approach.  I'm
suffering long droughts in between successful episodes.

I was delighted to read some of the "close reading" commentaries triggered
by Peter Quartermain's great query, especially Tenney Nathanson's because
I've had the identical experience.
The fear of close = closed which began as a needed response to the New
Criticsm (which, incidentally, performed mostly thematic rather than really
close readings) has now produced the opposite: students confronted by, say,
Beckett or Aime Cesaire, ignore what's on the page and jump off to some
ideological position.  When asked why a line breaks in a certain place or
what the relationship of some item to another is, they are absolutely at
a loss because no one has ever asked them to just plain really read or
reread, that is look empirically at what's actually there, materially. So
I'm delighted that the tide is finally turning, as it seems to be judging
from this week's discussion.

Subject:      close reading
 
Hank's question about the thematizing of close reading prompts
me to make a point which partly echoes Keith Tuma's posting of
earlier this week.  though 'experimental criticism' allows, or
anyway tries to allow, for uncertainty, for embracing 'the
inadequacy of our explanatory paradigms' (Charles B's
=Artifice=), the majority of =published= readings of literature
aims -- must aim, for respectability if not for very
publishability -- to demonstrate that its readings & therefore
its conclusions are the BEST way of seeing particular texts.
(which seems to come, in some dark past way, from religious
methods of textual explication: in order for us to be right,
everyone else has to be wrong, but must also have to do with
the human desire to have a right answer, & to be the one who
provides it.)
        that's obvious enough, but it made me think that the
academy has two types of close reading: one publishable and one
pedagogical (or speculative, say).  the latter may be the realm
of free play, the one we happily teach to students, the 'isn't
it interesting to consider what happens when we pay attention
to these lines in this way'; but the former is still mostly
stuck in the justifying, & therefore almost inevitably
thematizing (line 'meanings' lead to poem 'meanings' lead to
thematic meanings lead to historical, contextual, &c meanings,
to sew up everything), mode of close reading, the one in which
'when we say of something that it is true, we say that it has
stopped' (to use Alan Davies' formulation, in =Signage=, of how
static the notion of truth is for us moderns).
        the published realm of close reading, then, has an
off-putting rigidity, =historically=, while the pedagogical one
is a beautiful & permitting part of reading language.
 
isn't this fun?

Subject:      Re: close reading
 
if this discussion re close reading is polarized twixt 1) anything goes
and 2) only an unidentified number of "best" readings goes, then i guess
i'm forced into category 1... but as a member of same, i'd want to push
for a general recognition that "anything goes" is only a theoretical, or
better, hypothetical assertion... in (pedagogical, publishing, communal
and other) actuality, there are some "readings" that just ain't gonna
fly, period.
 
i do believe, further, that a few of the more professorial among us (tenney,
marjorie, myself), and not to privilege this latter category AT ALL, are
struck by how few rhetorical skills are actually learned by undergrads.
these days... for the sake of simplicity, let's just say that a general
level of syntactic awareness, say, constitutes a rhetoric (that is, that
grammatical analysis constitutes a rhetoric)... perhaps this is desirable
in some situations, undesirable in others... but to argue against same,
again, as a member of category 1 above, just doesn't make sense to me...
i.e., category 1 does not preempt the usefulness of this particular
rhetoric...
 
but to abandon my binary altogether:  i must confess to being somewhat
perturbed when faced with folks who are incapable? or just unwilling? EVER
to deal with a text in whatever terms "close reading" implies... just
kinda bugged, is all, and i certainly wouldn't want, esp. in these academic
climes, to position myself *agains* ideological readings... lord knows this
plays into the hands of some folks i'm in utter(ance) disagreement with...
that was *against*, of course, damn line editor... anyway, close reading
or not (of this post), you all follow me here i'm sure...
 
why not admit to the usefulness of close readings, however defined, at a
general rhetorical level?...

From:         Eliot Katz <eliotk@EDEN.RUTGERS.EDU>
Subject:      more on close reading, theory, politics, etc.
 
Before I go off on different tracks, I'd like to ask those who've noted a
lack of undergrad ability to do close reading whether they think that
correlates with an increased student understanding of history, current
events, political theory & other matters of social context, or whether they
find it part of a more overarching crisis in U.S. education? I'm also
assuming there are many thousands of exceptions, am I too naive?
        Regarding close reading, Kathe Davis wrote: "Anything can be TAUGHT
tyrannically, but there is nothing INHERENTLY tyrannical in being urged to be
more aware."
        I totally agree. (Perhaps contemporary critics exaggerate the New
Critics' lack of concern for social context? Were New Critics also
exaggerating predecessors' lack of attention to textual matters?) Overall, I
don't really think any particular style of literary criticism, nor any
particular style of poetry for that matter, is inherently progressive or
reactionary. For instance, among deconstructionist literary critics, as among
the modernist poets, politics ranges from democratic left to fascist. I think
we always have to try to avoid *a priori* assumptions based merely on form or
style, and take an actual look at the particular work (again, both its
internal & external dynamics) & make a case for our reading or judgment of
it.
        (Re the matter of attaching inherent political qualities to literary
styles, let me begin to walk out on what is definitely a tangent & possibly a
limb...) I think one tendency that can lead to imposing *a priori* political
labels, often used to dismiss certain styles of criticism or poetry
out-of-hand, is a tendency to conflate conceptual categories. This seems
pretty common today.  One of my favorite contemporary examples is the
post-structuralist theorist, Lyotard's (highly influential, I think)
conflation of the philosophical concept of totality with the political system
of totalitarianism. Besides conflating categories, that equation also seems
mistaken on the practical level, since the concept of totality was used
(among others) by some marxist thinkers who were clearly theorizing the
extension of democracy into all spheres of public life (e.g. extending
democratic rights to the working class) to ensure that no leaders could
remain unaccountable or outside the rule of law & in order to safeguard
diversity. As Daniel Singer has pointed out: during Rosa Luxemburg's day,
using the phrase "democratic socialism" would have been like saying "buttery
butter." No matter what other disagreements one might have with some of
these theorists (e.g. problems with teleology, orthodoxy, etc.), many were
clearly working for a *more* democratic society, not a less democratic
one--and it seems silly to blame these theories of extending democracy for
the eventual and often-horrific development of "actually existing socialism"
in the Soviet bloc.
        (Walking further out toward the limb's edge?...) This conflation of
categories also seems to me to occur in some language poetry theory where
traditional narrative & syntax structures are sometimes conflated with the
rules of the existing state--rules that interconnect with language
structures, of course, but that aren't reducible to language structures. (I'd
appreciate corrections here, since I'm still trying to learn this stuff...)
In this argument, as I understand it, breaking the dominant rules of syntax
(or creating non-narratives or anti-narratives in Jerome McGann's
formulation) is seen as an inherently radical act. But it seems to me that
both narratives and anti-narratives can be used for different purposes--both
potentially able either to help promote notions of progressive social change
or to help protect the status quo. (Re the latter, I think of TV commercials
that appropriate techniques of modernist juxtaposition; corporate paper
shredders; government documents & speeches that are filled with huge gaps in
narrative & logic, sometimes foregrounding language at the expense of
content, in order to mystify the public or maintain plausible deniability;
etc.)  I think part of the tendency among poets (myself included) & literary
theorists to conflate conceptual categories (esp. the literary & the
political) is the result of some part of us hoping that our writings might by
themselves transform the often-distressing political reality of our day.
        But, as much as I wish as a poet that I could believe in "magic
bullet poems," or, more to my political preference, "magic nonviolent civil
disobedience poems," or even "magic post-structuralist deconstuction of
oppressive state apparatus poems"; and as much as I think terrific poems
often derive a good deal of their energy from their attempt to achieve such a
magic transgressive political ability;  it seems to me more helpful & honest
to think (heuristically) of categories like poetry, politics, economics, etc.
as distinct spheres that interrelate in complex and mediated ways--i.e.
spheres that are not conflated but not autonomous either. The fun &
challenging part then is to explore the ways they do (& might possibly)
interrelate under  particular (past, present or future) circumstances. For
example, one can consider ways in which particular poems might interconnect
with social context by raising an audience's political consciousness,
inspiring alternative ways of thinking, urging commitment, offering shrewd
historical critique, envisioning healthier social reconstructions, etc.  I
don't think contextualizing precludes "close reading," since I don't really
think it's possible to talk about a poem's relation to social context without
looking at the text's internal dynamics. Poems, then,  written in a wide
variety of forms and styles, including poems that explode traditional syntax
& also poems that use traditional syntax, can potentially be seen to contain
emancipatory elements which a reader or critic (using a variety of critical
styles) can draw out. That doesn't mean that all poems will contain
emancipatory elements, but just that one has to be open-minded enough about
questions of form & style to actually look.
        One nice thing about avoiding the conflation of literature & politics
is that different criteria for evaluating poetic and political realms become
possible. (I guess I feel post-structuralism & langpo theory have done a
valuable job in helping to correct what may have been an overly determinate
way of  reading literary texts, but added a not-very-helpful overly
indeterminate criteria for judging politics.) Poetry is free to eXpeRimeNt
without getting called petit-bourgeois, too esoteric (or too didactic) or
some such *a priori* label often meant to dismiss a poem so that one doesn't
need to read it. (Poetry is also free to explore lots of areas besides
politics, and also to offer pleasure, etc.) At the same time, more
determinate and normative judgments are possible in the realm of politics in
order to arrive at (to even debate) bases for united actions, common
principles & platforms, agreed-upon strategies & democratic structures,
etc.--all the stuff required to build the sort of organized political
movements that are ultimately needed (along with raised public consciousness)
to create lasting radical, truly democratic & egalitarian social change.
        Sorry for the ridiculous length of this post. I'll go back to sitting
on the sidelines for awhile.
Sincerely, E. Katz
 
(If anyone's interested, re my last post, Stephen Bronner attributes the
internal dynamic & external dynamic phraseology to an Austrian philosopher,
Max Adler, whose book in German on Marx and Kant hasn't yet been translated
into English.)

Marjorie Perloff refers to the difficulty of students in talking why the
line breaks where it does, where something is placed on a page and what
that means, and the like. I have wanted, in reent years, to turn a part
of the discussion concerning poems to their contexts. For me, as a
bookmaker as well as reader & writer, this means the physical context.
That may mean that everything the author puts in the work has a meaning,
which is particularly evident in recent readings of Emily Dickinson's
manuscripts. But is authorial intention everything? What about choice of
paper/type/spacing? What about sky poems? What about poems in public
places? What about the sound of the page turning? Is there such a thing
as the physicality of meaning? These issues are certainly crucial to the
book arts and to the design arts (not the same thing, by any means), and
both of these arts may be in partnership with literary texts in various
ways. Is there any reality to the literary text outside its actual
physical manifestation? If so, what, and is that different than the
physical presence, and that would be exciting to talk about as well.
 
I'm afraid I have many more questions than answers here, but I do wonder
if these are issues others wish to talk about. And is this just an
extension of close reading?  really close reading . . .

 1. I,too, thought Marjorie (hello, Marjorie) had particulars in mind. Not
    absolutes, and yes some of the writing which engages me because of its
    relation to my own writing concerns draws 'the support' into the text.
 
 2. Close reading. Have we yet had information on the origin of the
    phrase? Who, if anyone, used it first for the purposes we think we
    recognise?
 
 3. Close reading is not close listening. The New Critical education I
    received, which I have to say I am grateful for-- at l8 I was a pretty
    capable reader of Donne, of Stevens ...-- was entirely semantic in its
    approach. I only learnt to HEAR poetry later, and from the poet's read-
    ing work in public. There was no voice. And then I found out about the
    Formalists (Russians) who did listen, but no one at my graduate school
    knew anything of them.
 
 4. Other particulars: close reading in what context? Or, is it ONLY
    the classroom context that's at issue? I mean is the concept useful,
     meaningful, when discussing our own reading. At any rate, IF that's
    so, what of that context?  Among other things it is a place where
    good ideas get ruined. Including methods of reading. I remember Mel
    Bochner (remember Mel Bochner?) saying teaching was throwing fake pearls
    before real swine!
 
 5. A note re. theory. I'm for the close reading of theory, of for
     theoretical texts which demand it. (demand?)

My experiences teaching poetry were not unlike Marjorie's (hello, Marjorie).
None of the students had ever previously been expected to actually look
and listen to the poem and consider it own its own terms.  They were
all experienced at translating English into English (thematic discourse,
what the poet might have said if s/he had a more limited vocabulary
and a pressing desire to please an instructor) or they were eager
to place the work in a theoritical context and then discuss that
context rather than the poem.  They had all caught the mysterious fear
of poems disease from prior instructors.  I suggested that they read
poetry the same way they listen to music (college students listen to
a lot of music).  I was amazed, but this actually worked better than
I could have expected.  When presented with the poem as an experience,
and something with a event with the potential to alter perception, they related to it that
way.  The poem ceased to be a trick question on some future exam and
became a work that they could enter into.  I'm mentioning this because
when they realized that a poem was an act of language and they were
at liberty to be affected by it rather than jumping through somebody
else's hoops, they became fascinated by how the poem created that
effect, the mechanics of the piece.  When they figured out for themselves
in class how John Ashbery's line breaks work, you could almost literally
see the cartoon lightbulbs coming on as they explained it to each
other.  s*%w D] 2 _. JGj3P Vx2T4 -fpo/   Op [A [A

I'm very much interested in pursuing what Charles Alexander has raised
beginning with physical context, and then listening and watching for all of
the "beyonds" that come from that.  There seem to be so many experiences
possible with the sharing of words and the ranges of intimacy or of widest
co-experiencing seem deliciously infinite.  It seems that as we increasingly
venture into the virtual, the more physical experiences (of, say, reading and
touching a beautifully made physical book) seem more to be savored. I guess
that what is happening for me is that simultaneously a multiplex of
experiences become possible.  And I need to be more fluent to be able to
appreciate as I'd like all the different way things reach me and the ways
that I might participate in these vehicles.  All the modes are different, no
one better or worse inherently, but each requiring  procedures, approaches
appropriate to it..
 
Add to that the challenges of an instructional setting, and the plot
thickens!  As all of the possibilities change, so have the students'
expectations/level of preparation/predispositions.
 
Thinking aloud on this one, simply.  Level of casualness about how a thing, a
word, a message is offered probably is connected to how it is valued, too,
further complicating the issue.
 
Well.  It's late enough.  I'm enjoying what I hear on the list more and more
these days.  Enriching.

Subject:      Re: Charles Alexander's post
 
Thanks, Charles, for bringing up the physical context (or manifestation)
of the poem as carrier of meaning. The first books of poetry I responded
to (after college) were those Kulchur Press editions, often with drawings,
cartoons, scrawled things, the books themselves of a particular bulk, very
"present" *as* books, without actually being (necessarily) "artists'
books." Looking back, I'm not so sure it was the poetry itself I was
enjoying so much (though I did, especially _Bean Spasms_ and _Album_) as
the fact that these books were not "transparent" in the way that many
(uniformly produced) books are. Reading _Defenestration of Prague_ in the
Kulchur edition (which I stupidly sold, thinking I'd re-find it) was more
of an experience, more memorable to me, than reading the piece in the Sun
& Moon reprint, "down-sized," uniform with most other S&Ms.  (Whether it
matters to Howe how the work appears or not.)
     Someone told me that Olson wrote, or at least "set,"  _Maximus_ for
the page, that his attention to the page as unit (at least in this
instance) was as intentional as that of his line. (Anyone with better
info, again, please jump in.) This person also told me that he thought the
poems could be reset for a smaller page (as in the New Directions
_Selected Writings_) with different, but equally satisfying effects.
Whether or not my friend's correct about Olson's intentions, it *is* a
wholly different effect reading the work IN LARGE in the UC edition.
     Then, of course, there are the people like Sir Walter Ralegh or
Donne, many of whose poems were, originally, scored as letters, were (so
I'm told) considered *published* as letters.  Publishing, in the strict
sense, was (again, so I'm told, please correct or expand) considered, by
some, "professional," & that in an almost purely derogatory sense.
     As much as I like it, I wonder sometimes, reading Frank O'Hara's
_Collected Poems_, if I'm not doing the poor guy something of a
disservice, that book seeming to exist in near- absolute opposition to
O'Hara's (another letter-poem writer) *intention* for those poems. But,
this was something that didn't come up for me until I'd found (very
luckily) first eds of _Love Poems (Tentative Title)_, _Lunch Poems_,
_Second Avenue_, the material he'd seen in print in his lifetime. That's
obviously speculation on my part, but it is true that reading these things
as "originally published" (already one step removed from hand or
typewriter), especially _Love Poems_, I get more of a sense of *how* he
was a "personal" poet (however tongue-in-cheek "Personism" may have been).
Much of what's most powerful in _Love Poems (Tentative Title)_ seems (to
me) washed out reading those same poems in the _Collected_. There's
something "authoritarian" about that giant book, an odd thing for someone
who'd put "(Tentative Title)" into a title of a published volume of poetry.
     So, yes, I do (personally) agree there's meaning in a poem's physical
manifestation. Poetry is largely "about" presence (even conscious attempts
to distance oneself from or remove altogether "ego"--well, that's an issue
of "presence"), so consideration of a poem's presence seems not only
perfectly valid, but worth further exploration.
     In a way--maybe something of a leap--some of the earlier posts about
community or lack thereof, about the nature of the poetry "world" itself,
seem equally germane with respect to considerations of poetry's "meaning."
Books of poetry, magazines, even discussions of poetry, never simply
"arrive."
     The question, I guess, might be: at what point do you lose rather
than gain in drawing in all of these other variables? I don't know, but
think the net can be larger than we often allow.
 
     Yours,
 
     Gary

Most important, in what sense? Best to prop a window open with? Keeps a
fire burning longest, in which case the quality of the paper used may
plan a part?
 
My choices as a writer may be different than another's, certainly
different than someone else's as a teacher, & my choices as a bookmaker
may take into consideration limited editions which bring the visual into
the verbal in books of such small circulation that there may be none or
at most a few on this list who have seen them -- in my mind that makes
them no less "important" than an edition which sells 20,000.
 
Also it seems to me that only someone not particularly involved with
so-called Language Poetry would put the request in such a way. To poets
who make up the enlarged group, many of whom detest the moniker, our
reading of Beowulf or Christopher Smart may provide as much generative
energy as our reading of Rae Armantrout or Carla Harryman. I'd be more
interested in such lists which are expansive rather than reductive,
although I'll admit it might be nice to see a list or lists of people's
favorite ten little-known-but-once-discovered-not-to-be-missed tomes.
 
But "most important?" Read, she sd, and by all means DON'T look out where
yr going.

Gary, you are getting into rich territory concerning what it means "to
read," i.e. that there is always a context, and that certainly not
limited to the physical book or page, but yes, involving how one came to
the work, real people, and more. I don't have time to get into this
tonight, but wanted to say that I found your comments on O'Hara lovely
and stimulating. Also to add that even reading Olson in the big
California edition is a far cry from reading the original editions which,
while they don't gather as many pages, are printed on pages with more
bulk, with covers which have real texture, so that, altogether, they seem
to occupy more territory. This, too, would be quite different than coming
across those Olson poems in letters and manuscripts. But certainly one
reads into the New Directions Selected the black & white aesthetic of
that press, which seems quite foreign to Olson, and one reads into the
California edition, despite the spacious size of the book, a slick
jacketed university/corporate packaging, getting even farther from that
"excessively rough moraine" (Letter #41) which, in its bulky and shapely
manifestation, is the Olson I always hear (interesting how even the
physical book or context of reading remains, as do the texts, in one's
memory, which is where the work remains, as books are closed for more
than 99% of their lives).

Two comments:
 
    One of the interesting things about poetry posted on the
net is that it can be downloaded and manipulated: fonts,
size, spacing, etc.  This allows the reader to be an active
reader, indeed.
 
     In the course of rereading some of Charles Olson's
work and writings I came across two items of interest.
 
1.)  In "Projective Verse" (_Poetry New York_, 1950)
he wrote: "If a contemporary poet leaves a space as
long as the phrase before.he means that space to be
held, by the breath, an equal length of time.  If he
suspends a word or syllable at the end of a line (this
was most cummings addition) he means that time to pass
that it takes the eye - that hair of time suspended -
to pick up the next line.  If he wishes a pause so
light it hardly separates the words, yet does not
want a comma - which is an interruption of the meaning
rather than the sounding of a line - follow him when
he uses a symbol the typewriter has ready to hand:
         "What does not change/is the will to change"
Observe him when he takes advantage of the machine's
multiple margins, to juxtapose:
 
                         'Sd he:
                            to dream takes no effort
                               to think is easy
                                  to act is more difficult
 
       but for a man to act after he has taken thought, this!
   is the most difficult thing of all'
 
Each of these lines is a progressing of both the meaning
and the breathing forward, and then a backing up, without
a progress or any kind of movement outside the unit of
time local to the idea.
     ...by this emphasis on the typewriter as the
personal and instantaneous recorder of the poet's
work...as though not the eye but the ear was to be
[poetry's] measure, as though the intervals of its
composition could be so carefully put down as to be
precisely the intervals of its registration.  For
the ear....can now again, that the poet has his means,
be the threshold of projective verse."

While skimming the 'form' discussion, wished to reiterate that there is an
obligation to engage at a =low level= (in the programmer's sense of the
term) with form as it is modulated by the technology which we are all now
using. Isn't it still the case that we accept these tools handed down to us
from on high and then continue to try and carry out our various forms of
piracy in the ways we are used to? Isn't there still too much simulation on
the literary net and not enough new form?
 
Now charles alexander's words prompt posting of a short piece written for
another context (general readership?):
 
[
 
The book is not just a physical object, the essential, definitive
icon of our material culture. It is the pre-eminent medium for the
storage and delivery of linguistic creation and information. As such
it is supremely effective and remarkably convenient. Books are
elegant and often beautiful. However, the book is also a metaphor
which may invoke any or all of its qualities in order to create new
ways of understanding the self. Everyone in the modern world, even
those people who share our culture but who were never or are no
longer people of the book, everyone must accumulate written paper
throughout their lives-- scraps, certificates, lists, deeds, forms,
letters, and so on -- and may sometimes long to see these fragments
organized, made sense of, bound together. For others this longing is
central to their existence. The book is, potentially, a body of
work, a summation of what you have to say and, finally, of what you
are. 'This book is my life's story, the sum of all I know. I put
everything into it, body and soul. It's my life itself, and before I
pass on I must close it, leaving it behind for others to read and
interpret.'
 
The meaning created by this metaphor is determined by the physical
characteristics of the book. This has not been static although its
predominant form -- the codex or collection of paper-like leaves
bound together so that it can be opened at any point -- has been
with us since the second century of our era. Book artists and others
have challenged this dominance, but however creative and inspiring
the resulting dialogue has proven, it has not undermined the shape
of the vital book-as-metaphor in our culture.
 
Now, later than many predictions would have led us to believe, the
book is changing. The word is applied to bodies of text which are
stored in electronic libraries, on the ever-spinning magnetic or
optical disks of programmable machines. Millions of these machines
are already linked on the InterNet. 'Books', 'libraries' -- the use
of these words, the inability to find others, demonstrates that the
irreducible, defining quality of a book is that it should be a body
of work recorded in language without regard to physical form. Thus
the metaphor survives but its shape and significance change forever.
There is no longer the sense that a book -- as electronic book -- is
bound or bounded, that you can see all of it at once, hold it, pick
it up, that it has a physical location. It is more difficult to
believe that the words of the book are fixed and stable, its
author's definitive statement on its subject. Although there is
general familiarity with the tools that conveniently allow us to
write and edit bodies of text, some people will be less content with
the realization that these same tools will allow others to
appropriate and even alter what they have created. Many will be
unwilling to apply a metaphor to themselves, as once they did, which
begins to suggest unboundedness, indeterminacy, openness to the
electronically interleaved books of anyone else on the InterNet.
 
The codex will live on. It is not a question of either or. Both old
and new books will coexist. Some writers and book-makers will wish
to explore new opportunities offered by the less familiar qualities
of unbound, coverless books. Some readers will welcome new ways of
understanding themselves in the ghostly, fragmentary, drifting
leaves of an evolving metaphor.

btw:
In one understanding Quakers quake at Friends' meetings (a metaphor for
these discussions?) as a physical manifestation of the tension,
vacillation, radical self-questioning which arises when a friend realizes
s/he has something to say in the context of profound silence.

Subject:      Close Reading; Authoritarian?
 
Close reading certainly need not imply an authoritarian
interpretation of a text, but close readings which attempt to impose
something on the text which is not there certainly are
authoritarian--as are any readings which claim for themselves
exclusive and complete accountings of a poem.
 
If you give a group of people a poem, for example, Williams's "The
Yachts," to read closely, you will find that a certain number of them
agree that  it is about the Race of Life, the competitiveness
encouraged by American free enterprise, and the indifference of the
winners to the losers, the "horror of the race." But different
readers will express this in different ways and will see patterns of
imagery, transitions in point of view, rhythmic effects, sound
patterns, associations of all kinds. There is an authority, and the
authority is the poem itself, but any good poem is rich enough to
allow an immense variety of reponses. Some, for example, might even
point out that "The Yachts" starts, very uncharacteristically for
Williams, in terza rima--a form that he hoped to emulate with his
triadic, or "step-down", lines in later poems. But the rhyme pattern
is immediately abandoned and the poem itself seems a criticism of
established patterns of authority--the initial strict form being
emblematic of this.
 
But what about the person (this has actually happened) who thinks
that "The Yachts" is an account of a caesarian section? And adduces
evidence from the poem to prove this? Is that person flouting the
authority of the poem? Such a reading would, to me, seem
authoritarian and arbitrary and I would want to escape from that
reading and go back to a free perusal of the poem. Which, it seems to
me, is about what really goes into the creation of the yachts, how
"The Yachts / contend."
 
And there are good poems that close reading doesn't do much
for--poems that depend on evanescent, tangential, indirect, and
possibly musical effects.

Sheila,
 
Since this is related, would you mind maybe talking a little bit about
the form of your published booklet, _Criteria for Being Touched_? Was
this a collaborative project? I ask because the crayoned cover, and the
slip of sandpaper (is that what it is?) stapled to the back of the book,
and even the way you have to unfold the pages themselves to read the
poems, all seem to further engage your reader, forcing him/her to be
aware of "touching." I love what Jonathan Brannen says about getting his
students to be aware of the poem as an *experience*, and this, the way
your book was manifested, seems to help ensure a reader's fullest
participation with that work as experience.
 
At first, I'd thought it was the publisher's idea to do these things, but
I'm beginning to suspect that you'd been the one to do this. Could you
verify and, if you've time, expand? It's my favorite of the half-dozen or
so books of yours I have, would love to read what you might say about it.
 
Thanks,
 
Gary

Subject:      More in re context
 
When learning about Bach in music school, it was explained to me (& anyone
with better info, please correct or clarify) that keyboard instruments
were, by necessity, only *approximately* in key, not only with wind
instruments, but with themselves. (A low "G" not being quite "in key" with
a "G" higher up, & this on the same keyboard; to say nothing of how a
keyboard interrelated with previously extant instruments.) In a sense,
assuming that music on the page isn't music, but music's map, the map
itself, with the invention of the keyboard, became even further distanced
from the physical territory itself. The actual pitch of "G"--even a
"specific" "G" carefully drawn onto a specific place on the staff--would
be different depending on whether a keyboard or wind was playing it. (&
this doesn't even bring in timbre, accent, attack, etc.)
     To clarify the above, the keyboard literally "flattens" the notes as
you go up the scale.
     Interesting that the keyboard and the printing press were inventions
that both came into existence around the same time period. (Not sure which
came first, though I suspect it was the printing press.) In a way, what
the keyboard does to music (or, to "actual pitch") the printing press does
to the word, both written & spoken word. Published books do have a
"flattening" effect similar to that of music played on the keyboard.
     I was a terrible music student, but I took away from it this sense
that the meaning of work has everything to do with its "physical"
manifestation. So, reading poetry where everything hinges on the "meaning"
of the words themselves, where everything is focused down to
"language"--it's less satisfying to me. Meaning you can be didactic
without having anything, necessarily, to prove, or wanting to do that, but
by limiting yourself to an understanding of "meaning" in a poem being
determined solely by the words, the extent to which those words, taken
together, mean this or that.
     Charles, you are absolutely right to consider the context of the UC
printing of _Maximus_; I think so many of us (including myself) can be
very shortsighted, or blind, to all of the other levels of meaning
radiating from a published (however published) work. Whenever I review Sun
& Moon books, for example, for _City Pages_ or other journals, I want,
always, to say something about how the press itself goes about promoting,
or contextualizing the work, which is almost always very dissatisfying to
me, it seeming so often to be in direct opposition to a poet's intentions
with a particular work. (I don't make fun of S&M's "Classics" series just
because I'm cantankerous.) Yes, as John Caley says, publishing is largely
about "convenience"--which immediately sets up a tension between work
written *against* convenience of any sort. And what poetry--besides the
purely didactic--has ever been written *for* convenience?

Subject:      Re: close readings
 
I hesitate to reply to a message when I have 22 unread messages (many
from this list) still waiting on my machine...but Charles Alexander's
comments are too delicious to let pass by.
 
Jerome McGann & Cary Nelson have both addressed, quite usefully in
somewhat different ways, the role of the page in its relation to the
text, and I would imagine that most people on this list would agree that
it's an active one.
 
Poetry is full of attempts on the part of poets to dictate the final
physical look of a work on the page. (I can remember how very strange I
I felt the first few times poems of mine were published in little
magazines back in 1965, sort of like a "primative" seeing himself in a
polaroid for the first time or my lingering dislike of my voice on
videotape.) From Grenier's box to his more recent scribbles to Duncan's
typewriter, these attempts generally never worked because the tools
(and goals) of the poet and those of the printer and book designer were
not identical. I had one publisher (Jim Orsino-Sorcic) who once broke my
own lines in places more convenient to his page size! Ah well, Faulkner
couldn't get them to publish Sound & the Fury in multiple colors either.
 
The poets who have succeeded at this have been printers/graphic artists
themselves (Blake being the Big Example).
 
Now with DTP, however, more people have access to some rudimentary form
of that knowledge. I controlled every possible element in Toner
(designed the cover myself) and in the forthcoming (R) -- where Bill
Luoma did the cover. But I know my limits when contrasted w/ a Chax
Press.
 
So, yes, a Big Yes, on every element on the page being a part of the
experience of the poem (the poem as an experience). It's pouring outside
right now, another day of near Biblical torrents here in California, and
I'm reminded of the passage in Brautigan's In Watermelon Sugar (a great
little novel), in which he says something like if it's raining outside
when you read this poem, then that's the title of this poem,

the new critics/agrarians were indeed political reactionaries, as walter
kalaidjian's forthcoming essay in Marketing Modernisms (Duke UP, ed. Watt and
Dettmar) demonstrates; allen tate defended lynching, etc.  so any attempt to
make them sound noble in their pleas for political "neutrality" is just plain
naive. however, that does not mean that any close attention to a text, esp. as
people have been delineating those multifarious practices on this list, is
fascistic. --maria damon

Dear Dr. Silliman,
        I found your post, in which you compare how it felt to have
your first poems published in little magazines back in 1965 to ...
 
"...sort of like a 'primative' seeing himself in a polaroid for the
        first time..."
 
truly moving.  Do you have any other such engaging similes for us
young & older white poets who predominate this list?

yes, the page... Ron's examples from right now are indeed examplary.
the thing goes, however,back a long way. One of the finest examples of
poet's will re page left hanging was Mallarme's COUP DE DE. It came
out in 1897, & not according to M's design instruction. In fact the
very first edition published according to M's instructions came out in
the late 70ies (this century) when Mitsou Ronat & Tibor Papp did so.

Subject:      WARNING: Poetry Area--Publics Under Construction {long post/essay}
 
The following is most of the essay I presented at the Twentieth Century
Literature Conference, at the University of Louisville, on February 25, at a
panel entitled "Constructing Publics", organized by Robert von Hallberg; Maria
Damon also spoke at this session.  --Charles Bernstein

WARNING ~ POETRY AREA:
Publics Under Construction
 
 
Do publics construct poetry or does poetry construct publics?
     Not so fast, where's the shell under those nuts, the nuts
under those texts, the texts under those author-functions, the
author-functions inside those periods, the periods inside those
stanzas, the stanzas inside those ever-loving tats for ticks,
quantums for particles, buzz saws for heliotropes, missionaries
for bugle boys?  The public does not and cannot exist until it
can find means to constitute itself; to convene in, on or about
the precincts of language; to explore its multiple, overlapping
or mutually exclusive, constituent parts, elements, components,
units, fractions, links, bands, conglomerations, alliances,
groupings, configurations, spheres, clusters, divisions,
localities; to find means of conversation without necessitating
conversion, among and between these constituent parts, allowing
that these parts shift and reconfigure in response to changing
circumstances.
     Poetry explores the constitution of public space as much as
representing already formed constituencies; risks its audience as
often as assumes it; refuses to speak for anyone as much as
fronting for a self, group, people, or species.
     In the process of recognizing new communities, new
audiences, and new publics for poetry, as well redressing the
previous exclusion of groups from our republic of letters, I want
to honor the complexity of contemporary American poetic practice
over and above its representativeness.  Within universities in
the 1990s, contemporary poetry is increasingly being taught for
the ways it marks, narrates, and celebrates ethnicity, gender,
and race.  To fit this curricular imperative, some poems may be
selected for their explicit and positive group representations.
Other poems (by the same poet or by other poets) may seem less
useful if they are found to complicate representation because of
their structural or formal complexity -- their contradictory,
ambivalent, obscure, or mixed expressions or inexpressions of
identity; or because of their negative or skeptical approaches to
fixed conceptions of self or group identity.  For poetry may wish
to question, rather than assume, group identity as much as self
identity -- not to deny that selves and groups exist, or have
voices, but to take their description and expression as a poetic,
as much as an epistemologic, project.
     Like many developments in education, the trend toward a
representative poetry is as much market or consumer-driven, not
to say demographic, in origin as it is ideological.  The gorgeous
mosaic of students in the classroom, to use former New York City
Mayor David Dinkins's term, puts an enormous, and appropriate,
pressure on teachers to create syllabuses that reflect the
various origins of our students as much as their multiple
destinations.   Yet, like in electoral politics, not every group
is recognized as equally significant in the often schematic, not
to say gerrymandered, patchwork of multicultural curricula.
Similarly, some subject areas such as contemporary poetry are
being used to front for the far more static approach to issues of
gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation in other areas of
the humanities and in the social and natural sciences.
     There are good reasons for this unequal development, since
contemporary poetry remains an indispensable site for the
exploration of the multiplicities, and multiplicitousness of,
identities.  TV and Hollywood movies continue to provide
inadequate, or nonexistent, representations of many groups in our
culture.  This may help to explain why poetry and the small press
are a _central_ place for such representations, given the
independent press's ability to serve what can as easily be called
small or niche markets as "marginal" communities.  For some
groups in our culture, poetry may be a primary site of basic
cultural exchange in a way that is hard to comprehend for those
who identify with the cultural representations of the mass media.
This is why it is crucial to differentiate share-driven mass
media from popular and local and folk-cultural activities whose
lifeblood is their low market share -- their small scale, let's
emphasize, rather than their "unpopularity".
     But it is not only sociologically identified "groups" that
are unserved or underserved by the majoritarian, market-share-
driven, mass media, but also "outsiders" of every sort and kind,
of every stripe and lack of stripe, as Maria Damon eloquently
argues in _The Dark Side of the Street_.  In an increasing
intolerant American cultural landscape, nonmajoritarian cultural
activities are stigmatized as elitist and as "special interests"
even though these activities are the last refuge of local and
particularistic resistance to the big government and big media
claimed, by the right, to be the source of our problems.  The
current attacks on public television and public support for the
arts and humanities are a sharp warning that intellectual
complexity, aesthetic difficulty, and non-mega-market-driven
cultural production have become "minor" art activities that
cohabit the same shadow world of poetry and the small press as do
group- and outsider-identified cultural practices.  For if
commercial culture is increasingly dominated by entertainment
products that are developed, through the use of focus and dial
groups, to evoke maximum positive response at every unit of
exposure; then art that is not just figuratively but literally
untested, art that evokes contradictory and confused initial
response, or simply appeals to a statistical minority of targeted
readers, will not be circulated through commercial channels.
     It should be no more a surprise to us in the USA, than it
has been for the past few years to citizens in the former USSR,
that market forces create different, but not necessarily
desirable, cultural values compared to those imposed top down by
the old-guard of cultural arbiters or commissars.
 
 
In the post-Pantheon world of book publishing, the diversified
companies that own the major trade publishers are charged with
publishing not simply profitable books but the most profitable
books.  Works that appeal to minor or micro publics, that is to
say small constituencies, are excluded from this system in favor
of works that appeal to macro publics, which is to say a
substantial market share of the targeted audience. The
circumstance is somewhat analogous to a TV show with millions of
enthusiastic viewers being cancelled for its failure to garner an
adequate public.
     Yet unprofitable cultural product does continue to be
manufactured in the commercial sector and not simply as a result
of the inevitable market failures of the entertainment industry.
The question is, why are some works published despite their
relatively poor profit potential in preference to other works
with a similar profit profile?  It isn't just nonprofit arts
organizations that lose money supporting their particular
cultural agendas.  Indeed, as far as losing money in an effort to
construct a public, the independent and alternative presses are
no match for such mainstream magazines as _The New Yorker_,
which, despite a circulation that has recently surged to 750,000,
appears to be losing as much as $10 million a year (that's
something like $13 per subscriber) -- an amount that could finance
a good part of the annual cost of the alternative poetry presses
and readings and magazines.  _The New Yorker_'s parent company,
S. I. Newhouse, is apparently less concerned with profit than
with cultural dominance -- legitimating the cultural product that
forms the basis of its media empire; for this exercise in
hegemony, circulation and publicity are more important than
profit.
     Of course, publishing statistics are notoriously unreliable,
especially when they concern the amount publishers are willing to
lose -- less to obtain cultural legitimacy, let me correct myself,
than to establish cultural values.  According to _The New York
Times_ (3/2/94, p. C20), Harold M. Evans, the publisher of Random
House's adult trade division, told an audience at the PEN
American Center that "the 29 books he published that made it on
to _The New York Times_'s 1993 list of Notable Books lost
$680,000" and the eight books that "won awards from the American
Library Association lost a total of $370,000."  Evans went on to
say that three of these books had advertising budgets of $71,000
to $87,000 each and that these books lost from $60,000 to
$300,000 each.  Innovative works of literature or criticism or
scholarship that challenge the dominant cultural values of
institutions such as Random House are not the most likely
candidates to receive this type of support; yet without such
subventions they stand little chance of being reviewed or
recommended in _The New York Times_, whose reviews are closely
correlated to its advertisers.  The point is not that official
"high" culture, just as alternative-press poetry, requires
subsidies; but that a system of selection and support favors
certain works over others; it is this system of selection and
promotion that allows the media conglomerates to control cultural
sectors that they have written off as largely unprofitable.
Note, however, that the content of the selections is less
important for this system of dominance than the system of
selection and promotion itself, since the alternative presses can
never afford to lose _as much as_ these corporations.
     It should be no surprise that it is neither the public nor
accessibility that creates official literary product, nor that
much of official "high" culture is a loss leader. Advertising and
promotion of targeted "loss leaders" are evidently worth the
price in influencing literary and critical taste, specifically by
fostering a cultural climate in which genuinely profitable
products may thrive.
 
Now should be the time to pull the hat out of the rabbit, the
bottle out of the genie, the tree out of the paper, the riddle
out of the problem.  For example to extol the emerging electronic
gateway as the balm for poetry, which will soothe our wounds of
poor capitalization and shrink-wrapped publics of long-term
outsiders, far-out insiders, subaltern-centric rhapsodes, and
other statistical anomalies from the upper west side of Manhattan
to the Castro district of San Francisco to the vacant lots behind
the Galleria mall in Nowhere, USA.
............
     I don't believe that technology creates improvement, but
rather that we need to use the new technologies in order to
preserve the limited cultural spaces we have created through the
alternative, nonprofit literary presses and magazines.  This is a
particularly important time for poetry on the net because the
formats and institutions we are now establishing can provide
models and precedents for small-scale, poetry-intensive
activities.  At the same time, the new interactive environment
suggests new possibilities for every aspect of poetic work, from
composition to visualization to display to performance to
distribution to reading, and indeed, to constructing publics,
this afternoon's putative subject.  (You say subject, I say
object; you say focus, I say associate: subject, object, focus,
associate, let's call the whole thing art.  But oh, if we call
the whole thing art then we must part and oh if we must part --
I'd be the object and you'd be the subject or you'd be the
subject and I'd be the object: let's call the art part off.)
     An enticing thing about today's internet environment is the
spirit of innovation and engagement that prevails.  A poem with a
sound file electronically published by _PMC_ (_Postmodern
Culture_) will get many more "hits" (user connections) than a
poem published in a comparable print journal because so many
people are cruising the net looking for new material.  Poetry
enters into a performance space on the net, providing text-based
content -- something poetry is particularly good at! -- to an
audience hungry for it.  There is some general interest, from an
internet-focussed public, in the new formats being created,
including those by poets and poetry editors.  The result is that
for the moment the public of poetry on the net is unusually
eclectic, even open, in their specifically poetic or literary
interest.  That is, a range of people will read and listen to
poetry, or participate in poetry-based discussion groups and
bulletin boards, who would not be interested in this genre in its
print- or performance-based forms (a claim that also could be
made for performance versus print and vice versa).  At the
moment, we have on the net something like a general audience for
poetry -- a claim that rightly will alarm those people conscious
of how restricted physical access to cyberspace is.  (Of the
poets I know in New York, less than 10 percent have e-mail
accounts; while in Buffalo, in a university based environment,
about 90 percent of the poets I know have e-mail accounts.)  But
I would argue that it is the current limitation of access and
programming that gives poetry its particular edge on the net and
as the information superhighway is put in place, the public that
will be constructed by it will return poetry to its hard-core.
     Poetry on the net is very small-scale: I am not talking
about big numbers so much as a certain fluidity of audience.  At
the University at Buffalo, we have set up an Electronic Poetry
Center, designed by Loss Glazier, a poet and our humanities
librarian, and Ken Sherwood, a poet and a doctoral student in our
Poetics Program.  The EPC, still under the construction, provides
gopher and WWW access to extensive listing of small press
catalogs and addresses, electronic versions of print journals and
archives of electronic magazines and our Poetics listserve
discussion group, plus alphabetically arrayed poems and essays,
recent obituaries, sound files, etc.  A related project is
_Rif/t_ magazine, a electronic poetry magazine (publishing poems,
essays, reviews, and chapbooks) edited by Glazier and Sherwood.
_Rif/t_ itself has 1,000 subscribers.  As to EPC, the number of
connections or hits per month has been increasing: we estimate
something over 600 connections per month.  Some of these hits
may be the same user going back for more; at the same time the
statistics do not account for all modes of access to EPC, so the
number of sessions is actually higher.  In any case, over 600
hits in one month compares favorably to the public for an
establish literary magazine.  Luigi-Bob Drake's _Taproot_
magazine provides the most extensive and useful listing of small
-- press magazines available -- providing short reviews of over 300
different magazines and chapbooks in the last issue.  _Taproot_
is also available on line, minus its feature articles.  The hard
copy version of the magazine has a print-run of about 2500, of
which 500 are distributed free in Cleveland, its home base.  The
e-mail version goes out directly to 500 subscribers and is also
redistributed to an additional 1,000 e-mail accounts as part of
_FactSheet5 Electric_, which in turn is available from over 20
archive and gopher sites with undetermined additional "hits".
_Taproot_ itself is also available via the EPC.
     More startling, and more informative as to the potential for
electronic distribution of "literary-niche" audience material, is
the incredible success of the electronic journal _Postmodern
Culture_.  According to co-editor John Unsworth, in the
approximately six-month period from May 18, 1994 to Dec. 8, 1994
there were over 40,000 requests for the table of contents of all
issues of the journal. In total, more than 358,000 items have
been requested from the PMC archives during this same period.
     Poetry on the net is not so much a positive development as a
necessary one.  The internet will become increasingly central for
poetry because of the economy of scale it provides, given the
high cost of printing and paper, the increasing expense for
unreliable postal service, the shrinking of the presently tiny
public support for literary publishing, and the absence of
poetry-committed bookstores in most localities.  Poetry editors
and publishers often have few alternatives but to use the
cheapest means of reproduction available: mimeo in the 60s, xerox
and offset in the 70s and 80s, and electronic publishing in the
90s. In the words of Joe Hill, Don't mourn, organize (though
there is plenty to mourn over).  A crucial prerequisite for that
organizing is understanding how this new space will affect the
composition and presentation of our work, especially insofar as
we respond in our work to this new electronic medium.  We also
need to explore the implications this emerging space has for the
composition and disposition of the publics for poetry.
     Unlike poetry on the net, poetry in print and live formats
presents few physical limits to access and user-interface given
the prevalence of hard-wired body systems for processing spoken
language and broad familiarity with alphabetic technologies.  Our
limits are more conceptual and ideological: the very niche-based,
specialized, focussed, small-scale, often non-overlapping
readerships that are a fundamental and vital and source of
poetry's aesthetic and social value.
     Many people say that the university, with its captive
audience of mostly 18-24 year-olds, has become the primary site
for the distribution of poetry.  I don't think this is quite
true, but few can fail to recognize how much of poetry's public
consists of students.  This reflects badly neither on poetry nor
universities, quite the contrary; rather, it reflects the
appalling lack of public cultural space outside the narrows
confines of the literary academy.  It is bad for poetry, and for
poets, to be nourished so disproportionately; for the sort of
poetry I care for has its natural habitat in the streets and
offices and malls and parks and fields and farms and houses and
apartments and elevators and stores and alleys and parades and
woods and bookstores and public libraries.
     Sometimes I imagine the kind of audience contemporary poetry
would have if it were on the radio on a daily basis: say a new
half-hour program every night at 8.  The public for this
programming would be small, although larger than our current
publics for poetry.  At the turn of this now turning century,
radio promised to revolutionize the distribution of poetry,
making widely accessible, at no cost, the new the new acoustic
riffs of the language arts.  For, of all our technologies, radio
has the greatest potential to create a democratic listening
space.  Without access to the public soundwaves, subsidiary,
privately available, spoken art media (tapes, CDs) cannot
flourish.  The exclusion of contemporary language arts from the
public air, from radio, is a stark warning about what we can
expect from the upcoming merging of cable TV, radio and the
internet.
     If contemporary poetry is able to construct only a series of
disconnected publics, then poetry is banished from that virtual
republic that we aspire to, all the more, knowing it
unattainable.  For all the utopian promise of technological
optimists, the answer is not in our machines but in our politics.
For we see in this society a constant erosion of public space --
space not privatized for maximum profit, but made available for
common use.  And so it seems we can only imagine the public
square, the town green, a Central Park of our poetries, where,
leaving the solitude or sustenance of our rooms or communes, we
might jostle against one another, unexpectably mingle, confuse
our borders: refigure ourselves, reconstitute our affiliations,
regroup.
     There is no education in the arts equivalent to having art
works available in open channels -- public spaces -- to intrigue,
befuddle, and engage those unfamiliar and familiar, but
especially unfamiliar.  Such initial points of public access to
art must not be abolished; neither should they be privatized,
through the restrictions of pay TV or high admissions prices. For
such sites to have a democratizing function they must be
maximally accessible from a physical, technological, and
financial point of view, just that what they exhibit may not be
so immediately accessible in other ways.  We must resist the idea
that difficult art is elitist, any more than that science is
elitist or that learning is elitist.  Such arguments breed
demagoguery not populist empowerment.  By denying the value of
the labor necessary to become linguistically and culturally
informed, we encourage the maintenance of an uninformed, indeed,
ignorant, citizenry.
     If the arts are denied public support, it is not the artists
or dedicated readers and viewers who will suffer, for one way or
another their commitment will keep them working and they will be
prepared to find art in out-of-the-way places.  But for the
uninitiated, the decline of public space for art can be
devastating, for they will have no common place to find non-
market driven art production.  Public radio and public
television, despite their manifest inadequacies, are, like public
arts funding through the NEA and other agencies, a fundamental
point of intersection between the public and the arts.  They are
the town square of art.  In a society that has few such points of
access, any diminishment of our public spaces for culture is a
catastrophe.
     Don't lament, or don't lament only: construct.

poetry.  For example, the standard size for books in the White Noise Series
is 8.5" x 5.5", a pretty standard paperback size.  Joe's poetry has long
lines, though, and sometimes he has right-justified lines which have the
feel of marginalia.  He also has a couple of pages which make use of a
mixture of fonts and type sizes to create a particular visual effect.  I
felt that in order to create a book which would carry Joe's work, I had to
change sizes and go to 8.5" x 6", giving the text a broader look and
shifting the proportions somewhat closer to square.  Our cover designer,
Steve Gomes, created an "outside" for the package which is in dialogue with
the contents:  Joe's brother had taken a B&W picture of the New York World's
Fair globe; the globe appears in one of Joe's poems and is an integral image
for the book.  We reversed the image so that it looks like the globe is
hanging in space, flipped the negative so that the continents appear as they
would appear on a map (convincing, but completely wrong, as any architect
would--and did--catch immediately) and then had the photo hand-tinted in the
style of 1930s photo labs, in blues and tans (exactly matching the colors of
the earth from space).  Steve then got a flat, black mat on which he laid
out the hand-painted photo, holding it in place on the front cover with
those little old-fashioned black photo corners.  He similarly set up the B&W
author photo on the back cover.  Then he went to our page layout program and
set up the titles, which he printed on paper of exactly the color that
newspaper turns when it gets, oh, say about 40 years old.  He printed them
in 150dpi resolution instead of the 600dpi our printer is capable of so that
they would look just as blurry as newspaper type.  Then he cut them out,
carefully, by hand and glued them on the black mat board, folding the
corners of one piece to crease the print and give it a more "authentic"
look.  Then we shot the whole board so that we could get a vivid 3-D effect.
The result is that the cover looks like pages out of a carefully kept
scrapbook.  To keep the scrapbook feel, we had the printer run the black
background in a seperate pass through the press in a *very* flat matte
black.  Then they ran the four-color passes in regular gloss inks.  Finally,
we did a double pass with liquid lamination--gloss lamination just on the
photographs, and matte on the rest of the cover. The result is that the
photo-corners look like they come off the page, a remarkable illusion which
resonates perfectly with the images in Joe's poetry.  We could have gone to
less trouble, I suppose, but then, the poet could also have taken it easier.
The result in either case would have been less pleasing.
 
I like computers and I am very into writing HTML documents, but there is
something different about manufacturing a book--I really like that
particular interaction between message and medium.

I certainly respect Ron's examples, and his own design of TONER, and
Pierre is right to call attention to Mallarme, but I think that, if the
discussion of space is limited to the page and its typography, something
is missing. Gary Sullivan wisely called attention to the context of
publication for O'Hara. I have got the first edition of Maximus IV, V, VI
down from my shelf, and in that book the weight of the volume, the
texture of pages and cover, all contribute. This is about paying
attention to what and how we read and what effects that reading, and the
field is much broader and  more complex than "the page."
 
I also have a sense that books today are very restricted in how they
might convey the sense of the poem. By that I mean that I suspect Ron
designed TONER according to at least some of the conventions of the
marketplace. I'm not certain a book with the size, uncoated paper, and
other charateristics of that second Maximus volume would find shelf space
in any but about four bookstores in the USA, if the book were by a poet
with about the same exposure as Olson had at the time that book came out.
In 1995 more and more of the smallest presses are conforming not only to
size standards, but also to paper standards, often to the 4-color
processes marketing seems to call for, and including bar codes. How does
an individual text, and a publisher, maintain a distinctive physical
manifestation? How will they do so in electronic publishing? Do the
advantages of the current means of distribution outweigh what is lost?

contra (as per usual lately, oddly) my friend Charles (A), I guess I'd
want to suggest that:
1) while, when dealing w a chunk of poetry (poetries) by various authors
where the going wisdom has to do w irreplaceable signature (17-C
mannerist; modernist--eg) it's interestin (a la Bob Perelman book I've
not yet bought/read?) to dispute the category of the "master work)
2) when dealing w something like Lang Po 1 which so insistently insists
on textuality and discourses etc etc, it might be, exactly, (most?)
interesting to focus (or insist) instead on the grain of the (non) voice
and the category of the would-be masterwork: of all the many-hundred (?)
(or couple hundred, it must be) books by so-called so-called G-1, which
of them, (if the books itself or "itself" sruvives another 50 years) will
survive as THE books from Lang Po - 1 that one needs to read?
sinc the question itself is inimical, in important ways, to the ethos of
the movement (or non-movement), it's THERFORE interesting.
or so say all of us ....

As a small publisher I conform to book trade standards, of necessity to
make it *possible* for a book to exist in the trade context, even if it is
unwelcome and may languish in a distributor's warehouse. There are always
constraints.
 
>How does

Surely that is a function of the creative effort some or all put in.
Dancing in chains?
 
>How will they do so in electronic publishing? Do the

We've already crossed the Rubicon. The hype is all true, except that it is
not possible for us to predict or even conceive of the final physical forms
in which the medium we are currently using will manifest itself. It is very
hard to believe that it will not have at least the flexibility and degree
of material articulation as does print/paper. It's likely that sooner
rather than later it will have acquire many 'sensual' characteristics which
will be as pleasing to us as those associated with productions of the
finest paper/print practioners.

That was when Ted Nelson invented hyperText.)

Subject:      Poetry and the Page
 
Concern with the interraction of poetry and its appearance on the
page coincides with periods of adventurous experimentalism in poetry
writing. But first you have to have a page. That was difficult before
the printing press, but not impossible. A few poems in Greek, the
"technopaignea," survive--shaped poems that resemble an egg (a poem
about a nightingale), panpipes, a few others.
 
In the later 1500s there was a lot of experimentation with
accommodating the poem's appearance on the page to its content--a
mixture of graphics and print, and in the 1600s there were emblem
poems. The irregularity of line lengths, too, could be advertised by
conspicuous indentations, and there were poems that bordered on free
verse--in fact, given the context of the times, were free verse.
 
Beginning about 1680 and continuing to about 1780, typographical
devices were scorned and avoided for the most part. The page was
simple a place where the poem could be recorded. There are exceptions
to all the generalizations offered so far, but on the whole there was
this rhythm of experimentation and reaction.
 
Then with Blake and continuing with the Pre-Raphalites there was
renewed experimentation with typography, graphics, advertised
expressiveness or irregularity, etc. Surely Whitman, a printer
himself, realized the typographical impact of his lines--as opposed
to what was generally expected in the nineteenth century.
 
Mallarme pointed to the future with the typographical extravagances
of "Un coup de des,"  and Pound and Amy Lowell certainly used
typography for formal purposes. It has been argued that Williams's
"triadic" line was really a typographical device, and that Olson's
distribution of his lines appeal to the eye more than serving as a
transcription of his "breath."
 
Imagist doctrine (Ford, Hulme, Pound, Lowell, Aldington, etc)
emphasized the visual over the audible, and that included the
appearance on the page. e. e. cummings used the typewriter for witty
purposes that involved exact placement of letters and words, and of
course Olson insisted even more grandiosely on that tool's
usefulness.
 
The visual media available for recording poetry always affect the
poetry, especially in periods of experimentation. First came moveable
type, then after a long time, the typewriter, and now all the graphic
possibilities--the fonts, etc--available in word processors. Actually
Mallarme went a long way very early; his poem was so hard to set in
type that it was not published in correct form until some years after
his death
 
Neoclassicists, from Joseph Addison (who called shaped poems "false
wit") to the present tend to be unsympathetic with the notion of
typographical poetry. This is another of the issues contributing to
the bifurcation of American poetry.

Yes, Tenney, I do have some objections to a listing of the "masterworks"
of langpo, although part of the problem I had with that request was that
it did not ask for the ten "masterworks" or "best works" (about which you
could give your list, I could give mine, etc.), but for the ten "most
important." What does important mean in this sense? I may find works
which are most influential are not works which I consider the most
accomplished. I may argue that the most accomplished are not the most
generative or courageous. I also may believe that a book issued in 200
copies (or even 50) by a very small and independent press in northern
California is more of a masterwork than the best distributed langpo book
published by Sun & Moon (arguably the most "successful" langpo publisher,
but "successful" by what standards -- aesthetic, marketplace, other? -- &
this is not to argue against Sun & Moon, Douglass, as I love your work).
 
So, first, make clear for me your definition of a masterwork, then I'll
be glad to suggest how I might fill in the blanks in the top ten. But I
suspect your definition may be more interesting than my list (or someone
else's).
 
        all best to you & all the list,
        charles alexander
 
ps -- to John Cayley, yes I still believe there's lots of room for
creativity in bookmaking, even for the wider marketplace, although I
sometimes feel bad that some of the tools are lost or made difficult.
Interesting that some of the most exciting developments in commercial
papermaking are in the issuing of exciting (visual & textural) recycled
papers, and that these particularly lend themselves to book covers,
except for the fact that they are uncoated, which means some bookstores
don't want them and that their suitability for 4-color printing (without
going to great expense, although the results can be dramatic) is not
great, which means that sales reps have a harder time marketing them. I
am currently driven to design books for the market which do conform (at
least enough to make them work, but not enough to make them absolutely
"regulation") to trade standards, but also to keep making books whose
devotion is to the union of bookmaking excellence & innovation with
literary works, even though the labor to produce such works is great and
the market is tiny.
 
As to the possibilities of sensuality in the electronic realm, I am
excited and fairly ignorant, but hopeful.
 
To H.T. Kirby-Smith, thanks for the brief history, it's helpful. But I
don't think "typographical poetry" is the extent of what we're talking
about. As a poet who makes books, certainly, the shape of poem on page,
the kind & shape of page, the double-page spread, the conception of
sequencing in turning the page, as well as other aspects of color and
form, are all part of the artistic composition, yet these are not
"typographical poems" in any sense I recognize that term. I know there
are other poet/bookmakers on this list, and I wonder what they have to
say about this issue, whether they are printing/designing their own works
or works by others. I am interested in the possibilities of design/book
art, while being a "presentation" of texts, at the same time being a
"reading" or "interpretation" of texts, and even, when possible (and this
is tricky) being a "collaborative partner" with texts. Among texts some
would consider as language poetry (getting back to possible masterworks,
Tenney), I would point to the first edition of Susan Howe's
DEFENESTRATION OF PRAGUE (Kulchur Foundation,1983), Charles
Bernstein & Susan Bee's THE NUDE FORMALISM (Sun & Moon, 1992), and Lyn
Hejinian & Kit Robinson's INDIVIDUALS (Chax, 1988), as three books which
enact such a partnership in three dramatically different ways. I
sometimes wonder, though, if future scholarship will keep such
presentations/partnerships in mind, or pay attention only to the texts,
which I find limiting. On the other hand, I am not a proponent of some
masterwork notion of bookmaking, rather that such partnerships are
illuminating while not being the only artistic possibilities, yet
maintain some eminence when they are the first printed editions of texts.

Thanks, Jonathan Brannen, for your post on close reading(s).  I agree
the context of university classes can be destructive in just the ways
you indicate.  Content dis-formed is what the system produces,
because at the place where your poetry-as-music or (as-for-music)
gets found, so discourse re-theme and content gets dis-abled.
 
Equivalent in painting and other "visual" arts discourse is:    taking
painting exclusively as picture, where picture is reduced to a small
selection of nameable objects, each of which can then be drawn into
theme-content discussion (and "theory") but with no regard for
questions of how in the medium all that can be seen.  (Classic much
anthologised example is Louis Marin reading Poussin's Et in Arcadia
ego. )
 
The level of the working by which the work has had to be constructed (constituted as image)
disappears from view, where the work in the medium and the resulting
figuration (or absence of it) makes picture visible.

Excuse, please, folks, the premature sending that just occurred.  I'll begin
again:
 
Gary's question (about the form and physicality of my small chap called
CRITERIA FOR BEING TOUCHED) is most welcome. Much of the credit must go to
C.L. Champion, the publisher, who lives in Tucson. I had sent Champion a
small grouping of poems, many of which seem now to me to have a quality of
casualness about them that may have inspired the publisher to present them
together with wonderful drawings crayoned in and showing childed printing on
the front cover, using the space as children do, with the word "Sheila"'s
taking up the whole horizontal space, necessitating a move to another place
to the right of the drawing of figures and sun and a house on the left of the
page, just to get in the middle initial "e" (to distinguish, some of you
know, from another Sheila Murphy in the lit world - I did this a long time
back, knowing what a common Irish name I have - and there indeed turn out to
be several by my name).  Anyhow, the little stub of sandpaper on the back of
the book does several things as far as I can see.  The suggestion of sand
itself is there, as in sandbox (the recollective aspects of the work, notably
the first piece about my now late father, called "I Could Ask Anything,"
which youngs its way along to mirror, as happens, the naive art concept on
the cover), and as in rough cut of feelings almost unconsciously released as
they are from childhood.  There's mention of physical things in that first
poem (a haibun, by the way) about my father's making our lunches and placing
them in brown manila envelopes he would recycle from the office (long before
this sort of thing was done).  The style of the book seems to be perfectly
tuned to the moment the experience it talks about was born.
 
A primary reader of what I do, who responds to many things before they leave
me, also loved this book, Gary.  Bev Carver immediately perceived the link
and loved what C.L. Champion had done.
 
I have had this hunch concerning serendipity that keeps proving itself true:
 one of the most exciting aspects of writing comes at the point at which an
editor who really cares can leap with the work to the physical place at which
it needs next to occur (for many other people to perceive).  I'm constantly
lucky in this.  And notably in small, small press efforts that come directly
from garages.  This is the best example I know of where something boundlessly
and simply beautiful occurs when I've completely let go of something I have
written.  For me, the physical imagination of the other person comes as a
gift that enriches the experience of making.  While I love direct
collaboration (I do a lot of that with John M. Bennett (in text) and with
Megha Morganfield (on Celtic harp with text) and some others, THIS is
collaboration of another kind.
 
Thanks, Gary, for asking.
 
Sheila

I meant was that it would be helpful to begin a list and commentary of

around The Language Poetry dialogue--let's call it a community

coherent resource that could be deposited at the E-Poetry Archive as a

"reader-response writing.")
     Lamb's essay "On the Tragedies of Shakespeare" is the first instance
of someone suggesting a preference for *reading* Shakespeare over viewing
the plays performed. An excellent, intelligently stated argument, with all
the panache (& thrice the wit) of Grenier's "I HATE SPEECH." (You'll have
to read Lamb's essay to see whether or not you agree--and to what
extent--Lamb's & Grenier's concerns are related.)
 
     3. Gertrude Stein. No need to explicate. Richard Bridgman's _Gertrude
Stein in Pieces_ includes a (complete?) bibliography, with actual &
well-guestimated dates for each work, if you want to read her
chronologically.
 
     4. Samuel Beckett, esp. _How It Is_, _Stories and Texts for Nothing_,
_Fizzles_, _Ill Seen Ill Said_, _Worstward Ho_, _More Pricks than Kicks_,
_Company_ and _Stirring Still_. A big influence on Coolidge, who seems a
big influence on lang pos.
 
     5. Jack Spicer, _Language_. (cf. Silliman on this in _New Sentence_.)
 
     6. Clark Coolidge, esp. _Space_, from 1970. The spine of this book
claims it was published by "Harper & Row"; I think they did that with
mirrors.
 
     7. J.G. Ballard, _The Atrocity Exhibition_. Originally published in
1972 by Panther; reissued (expanded edition?) recently by Re/Search. His
notorious "Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan" (there's an Andrews title for
you) orig. appeared in 1968 in _Ronald Reagan, The Magazine of Poetry_,
edited by John Sladek and Pamela Zoline. (Includes groovy, Brainardesque
line-drawings by Zoline.) Andrews is funnier, but Ballard stays with you
longer. (Well, okay, "has stayed with *me* longer.")
 
     8. Ad Reinhardt. It's been too long since I've read him to explicate,
but I remember, first coming across journals like _Ottotole_ and _Poetics
Journal_, that the Ad-man'd covered some of that conceptual ground with
respect to the visual arts. His art-world satire collages (including a
horse-racing form with the names of various abstract expressionists
substituted for horses) are not to be missed. He may or may not prove
relevant.
 
     9. The Firesign Theater, _Don't Crush that Dwarf, Hand Me the
Pliers_. If anything can be said to've prepared me to read (& appreciate)
Bernstein, it was this record. I'm constantly amazed by the lack of
(serious) critical attention these guys have received. One of the members,
David Ossman, did the interviews of New American Poets published in _The
Sullen Art_. (Corinth published that, I think.) There are several e-space
"whatchyoucallems" devoted to the F.T. I've discovered using Gopher.
Can't remember where they are, how I got there. At least one site
includes the F.T. "lexicon," which might be valuable for the un- or
recently initiated.
 
     10. Alan Davies, "Peer Pleasure," just published in _Cyanosis_ #2
(e-mail cyanosis@slip.net for info). Any serious study of a movement, group,
clique or tendency might include a well-stated, serious critique. "Peer
Pleasure" is an example.

We have now sad news: two weeks ago
Estonian poet and actor Juhan Viiding
(Elo Vee's father) made a suicide.
His cry against the brutality of
contemporary life, its stupidness

our hearts. Funerals were last
act of lifelong desires to make
the world differ real and false.
New times were too hard for him
to bear.

I can't recall off-hand whether Maximus IV, V, VI was published by
Jargon, Cape Goliard/Grossman, or perhaps someone else.  In any case,
I wonder how widely distributed it actually was at the time it was
published.  I know that Olson personally placed copies of the previous
volume of Maximus in bookstores, probably by towering over the owner.
 
I share your concern about the pressures to conform to publishing
standards.  Reading books is an intimate experience.  And all aspects
of the book contribute to that experience.  I treasure both ends of
the publishing spectrum that are disappearing, those amazingly
textured, inventively designed, carefully executed, letterpress,
handbound editions (such as Chax "non-trade" editions, though the
trade editions are lovely too) AND the xeroxed (in earlier days
memeographed) books done as cheaply as possible just to get the work
out.  I value my disentigrating copies of books from presses like
Doones and Angel Hair.  The quirks and ecentricities of the handmade
(homemade) book on both ends of the spectrum are a delight.
 
I'm wrestling with these issues now.  Standing Stones Press publishes
chapbooks.  They're attractive, carefully made and reasonably inexpensive.
I do everything myself in order to keep the costs down because I want
them to be affordable.  I fantasize about breaking even someday but
this is not a capitalist venture.  I think it's psychologically
important for younger writers and writers that are not as well known
as they should be to have collections of their work printed.  The
 
The problem, of course, is that don't meet the shelf and profit needs
of all but a few bookstores.  Small Press Distribution won't carry
them.  The reasons I was given is that they're not taking on any new
publishers of chapbooks because they don't make enough money from
them to make it worthwhile and that they're moving toward carrying
only trade editions because that's where the market is.  Now, I can
understand their desire to increase sales and stay financially
solvent, and I can more-or-less ignore the irony of a non-profit
corporation complaining about not making enough profit.  But here's
the conundrum, I can do a trade edition annual in which I essentially
publish the chapbooks I would have, but the psychological boost that
comes from having what may be your first collection published has
been denied you.  Instead you're lumped together with other writers
with whom you have little in common and there's a higher price tag
for all involved.
 
So, if I capitulate a spectrum of distinctions get lost.  Now I confess
a certain nostalgia for the book.  They're portable, tactile, don't
require hundreds of dollars of equipment to read, and can be read
when the power's out.  But I'm also considering electronic publication.
Until the frontier aspects of the net are squashed by government
interests, you have spontaneous distribution and minimal overhead.
I suspect that electronic publications will evolve into collaborative
efforts due the level of expertise required to utilize the wide
media available through the computer.  Electronic journals will
contain animation, "films," music, voice, text and who know's
what all thrown in the mix together.  Who can foresee how it will
evolve?  The problem I see at the present is that the net is a realm
of the priviledged.  You have to have the equipment to access it and
you have to have an entrance point.  Public sites are scarce.  This
is less an issue for those of you associated with universities where
limitless net access usually the norm.  If you're not, it gets
expensive quickly, even when you can make connection without racking
up long distance phone charges.
 
I throwing the above out for consideration.

Dear Jonathan:
 
        Maximus Poems IV,V,VI was published in 1968 by Cape Goliard
Press in association with Grossman.  When I was a student studying
Olson, in 1973, it was most difficult to find a copy.  Students searched
used bookstores in the hope of finding a copy.  Until Butterick com-
pleted his heroic task of the Collected Maximus, I believe IV, V, VI
was out of print.
        As to the idea of Olson pressing his work on any bookseller,
it is my impression that Olson cherished, and hoarded his copies. I
recall vividly Harvey Brown and Jack Clarke fondly describing Olson's
hospital room - and the stack of IV,V,VI prominently displayed and
referred to by him - it was a treasure.  The literal fact of its
accomplishment and material presence was no small feat - it signified
a labor of love by Olson and the many friends who believed in his work.
Its "success" measured by sales - was never the point.

To list subscribers at Buffalo:
 
I'm going to be giving a talk at Buffalo on Friday March 31, sometime in
the afternoon (2, 3, or 4:00, I believe). The talk is titled "Wallace
Stevens and the Pragmatist Imagination" and is a part of a book I'm
writing on Pragmatism and American Literary Modernism (the literary part
being, for the most part, devoted to Henry James, Gertrude Stein, and
Stevens).  Some in the audience (students in Art Efron's Pragmatism and
Literature seminar) will, if I'm not mistaken, have read my recently
published "The Esthetics of Pragmatism," in American Literary History,
Winter 1994 (not, however, "required reading").  This, for those of you
interested, doesn't really cover any poetry, though Stevens sneaks in near
the end: you'll have to wait for the book!  (Not long, I hope.)  The
talk, on the other hand, is full of close reading, of the best kind.
 
I'll post the time and place in a couple of weeks.  Hope some of you can
make it--

Several poetry lists have been compiled by the poets of whom you speak. A
group of us compiled a yearly list in the Segue distribution catalog. I
can give you this which consists of 300 titles. A list of ten as has been
suggested is, as others have suggested, like asking which dozen eggs
makes the best omlette. Any eggs will make the omlette you choose to
make. The works of the poets of the past 20 years compose matrix of
poems, themes, and strategies and to isolate any in a list is to miss the
point of the matrix structure. Can we begin to isolate works in this
overall and complex way rather than a string of titles and justifications?

back to the masterworks.  The topic, that is (not like "back to the
things themselves!").  I don't know that the criteria (would) come first,
Charles; just (perhaps) after a while (20-30-50 years say) some books,
and writers, will rise, or stick, or whatever your trope is (maybe the
spaghetti on the wall is best).  And I think that that's gonna be
interesting, for Lang Po in particular, just because it goes against the
grain of the enabling rhetoric (not so for modernism) and is therefore
likely to show unexpected things about Lang Po, and to shed interesting
light on it.  I'm not really invested or even interested in arguing canon
right now.  There are just so many truisms about discourse, and
textuality, and enabling of readers and etc etc that it's nice to
contemplate a meaningful (let's hope) engagement w some of the poetry
that comes at it from a stance quite different from its own.
(the obverse and less interesting--but satisfying!--case is to watch
Charles Altieri take Worshop Poetry w its pride in Craft and The Well
Made Poem and The Individual and cook it all down to a suet (sp.?) w
maybe 3 ingredients).

Dear B. Cass Clarke
 
Of course, Maximus's success measured by sales was never the point, nor
did I intend to imply that it could be measured in sales.  I was addressing
Charles Alexander that only about four bookstores would carry a comparable
ahem,  I was addressing Charles Alexander's observation that no one would
stock a comparable book today (comparable in terms of size and needed
shelf space for a poet now at a similar point in her or his career).
 
My notion of Olson towering over bookstore owners comes from reading
Jonathan Williams' account on Olson personally placing the Jargon
edition of Maximus I - III in bookstores in small towns in North
Carolina, stores so unlikely to sell them that Williams claimed
copies were still in stock in the mid-1980s (for the original list
price).  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the story or the accuracy
of my recollection of it, other than to say I think it's fairly
accurately.  I think I gleaned this from an interview with Williams
in Vort in the early 1980s.
 
I don't personally placing books in bookstores precludes the possibility
of later hoarding copies.  Having watched a couple of my own books go
out of print, I tend to be generous with copies and aggressive about
placing them in stores when they first appear and considerably more
parsimonious when there are only a few copies left.  I think Butterick's
labors are profoundly admirable.  Nor do I find Olson's personally
trying to make copies of his books available to a potential audience
less than admirable.  The unignorable fact, though, is that booksellers
measure the success of a book in terms of sales, which is why you
had such difficulties in finding copies of Olson's book.
 
Thanks for clarifying the issue of the publisher for me.
 
Best regards,
Jonathan

a quiet emendation---Olson was a very shy man, and for all his loud
palaver, would hardly have hovered over a bookseller.  In the sixties
when he was back in Gloucester, there was never a book of his to be
seen in local shops (though here and there you'd see books of Ferrini
and others), and his frequent letters to the Gloucester Times were
on matters of public import other than poetry.
 
You're right in thinking MAX IV/V/VI did not have huge distribution,
but it was around, and more available for a while than most books of
poetry, so those who had any interest in such matters could and did
find it.  (As you'd find Content's Dream now, for instance.)
 
It is interesting to recall the late George Butterick's conscientious
even desperate attempts to decipher certain later Olson scripts, where
decipher really meant to enpage, let me use such a word. Those who heard Olson rread out loud know that the domain of the page and the domain of the voice
seldom coincided, and were not, I think, meant to in any obvious
illustrational way.  The way of the page was the man's cry.

by folks who disliked, envied or otherwise had reason to misread

his living memory will be dead and when those who knew him and know
the distortions that are used to discredit him, are exhausted.

Dear Cass,
 
I certainly had not intended to misrepresent Olson's person.  I view
the image of Olson in this perhaps apocryphal bookstore with a degree
of warmth because I've talked to enough trade managers in bookstores
to understand that it can be awkward trying to get them to stock
poetry.  I relished the human element of the tale.  And I confess to
braking for bookstores in North Carolina on the chance it might be
true.
 
I don't know what to say about my or anybody else's easy use of the
Olson mystique.  There's no denying that there is such a mystique,
unfortunately images can never be accurate and with even the best
intentions they distort the reality of the person.  I don't wish
to be perpetuating falsehoods when I mention Olson, but never having
met Charles Olson, I have to take somebody's word for truth.  The
alternative is to refrain from mentioning him, and he's too important
a figure not to be mentioned.  I hate to use the term figure in
reference to anyone, but for me he can never be the complex human
being that you interacted with.
 
If it's any comfort, Olson's detractors are fighting a losing battle.
There's no doubt in my mind Olson's poetry will continue to be read.
I'm sorry if you feel I've done him an injustice.  I had not meant
to.  His work and literary reputation are both strong enough to
withstand even the most spurious attack.  Since he's one of the
writers to whom I keep returning, I'd rather not be construed as
contributing to such an attack or perceived as participating in it.
I'll try to mend my wicked ways.  How did you meet Charles Olson
and what was your initial impression of him?  I kind of excited
to be "talking" with someone who knew Olson.  Please excuse my
gracelessness that brought it about.
 
Best regards,
Jonathan

Dear Jonathan Brannen,
 
If you have not done so, I hope you will write up everything you know
about the progress of small-press publishing from Jargon Press to the
present, along with accounts of the personalities involved. As best I
can tell all your own book publications are poetry.
 
Is Jonathan Williams still alive? I never met Olson, but Williams
gave me a hard time about not arranging a poetry reading for him
years ago--and then we got onto the more agreeable subject of the
Appalachian Trail. I was in Black Mountain just the other
day--stopped off while heading to Tennessee. There's a historical
marker on old Route 70--no reference to any poets by name. If I got
to the right place in the end, the campus is now occupied by the
Western Division of the Department of Human Resources, including an
Altzheimer's treatment center. Only postcards available in town were
general views of the Black Mountains, except for one of the drugstore
itself, Black Mountain Drugs, which is probably much like it may have
been if Olson bought aspirin there.
 
Has anybody thought of a poetic guidebook? Walden Pond,  City Lights, Jeffers's
tower if it's there, the academic computing center at Buffalo...

My favorite part of Vanity Fair is when they ask celebrities what they
are reading before they go to bed. Imagine how much better it would be if
we were able to hear what people were reading whose tastes and minds we
actually respect?

James,
 
Thank you for your helpful comments. I would very much like your list of
300 titles and would like to use it as a jumping off point for a "matrix"
or "galaxy" oriented resource. Of course, as I implied in my last post, ten
seems like a ridiculous number for all the reasons you mention. But, if we
can think non-hierarchically and in a horizontally spread manner
concerning this project, it could prove to be a valuable resource for=20
many people who haven't been in this dialogue for as long as you have. It=
=20
seems like the contributors to this list are growing every day and I feel=
=20
that an archive like the one we're discussing could be essential to=20
laying a groundwork for those unfamiliar with much of the reading=20
material (which is, unfamiliarity through poor access). Many books have=20
fallen out of print and many people are so new to Language Poetry, that=20
they don't even know that many of these titles have ever existed. Access=20
to resources has been limited. I can't tell you how many authors and=20
publishers in the scene complain to me that their books aren't known=20
about due to poor distribution that in turn, creates a lack of interest.=20
It=D5s really a shame. For example, access to your Segue list is limited. I=
=20
live in the same city as you, I speak on the phone with you, and see you=20
at readings, but it never crossed my mind that such a thing was in=20
existence (I've never, quite honestly, until recently known what Segue is=

or how get at it. To this day, I=D5ve never seen the Segue catalogue of=20
which you speak. I do, btw, consider myself a media-savvy New Yorker, and=
=20
not much escapes my attention.) No fault of anyone's except we're dealing=

with a different mode of communication here on the net (which is also new=

for many people) that has the potential to point people from all over the=

been working on for many, many years. You might not be aware of it, but=20
you sit on a trove of information that remains relatively inaccessible to=
=20
people entering the dialogue at this much later date. If we were to begin=

with your list, the base for an excellent resource would be solid. If we=20
could continually update it, add to it, and revise our opinions of the=20

The informal "history" of small press publishing is a long term
interest of mine, but it's progress is too mercurial for me to
do justice to.  And I'm sure there are others on this list more
knowledgible than I am.  I'd love to hear some of the "war stories"
that the various people who have been involved in literary publishing
might have to share.
 
Having recently "made easy use of Olson's mystique" I'm hesitant to
speculate about the existence and whereabouts of anyone.  To the
best of my knowledge, though, Jonathan Williams is alive, and my
understanding is that he has taken up full-time residency in
Great Britain, I believe in Devonshire, though I'm not certain.
Perhaps someone reading this can provide you with a current
address.
 
Best of all possible but progressively improbable worlds,
Jonathan

(longish post)
 
            'It is not that we go into the past, live in the past, to find
her, but that her print, her traces, are around us. Indeed, if one searches
the past for her, the search will lead to fiery details, a stroke here and
then an airy space, another stroke of what is now called fact, and then
something obliterated, drowned, burned, lost. And then another stroke,
until an entire structure of a life begins to rise, brilliant, with long
reaches, venturesome, airy, full of risk, moving in a way that speaks to us
in our century.
            She is a rebel who appears to fail at every climax of her life.
She can be seen to go deeper at these times.' (Rukeser 'The Traces of
Thomas Hariot')
 
            I've often referred to Muriel Rukeyser's terrific book 'The
Traces of Thomas Hariot'. It seems to encapsulate some of the problems
lurking in premature disussions about book objects, publishing formats, top
tens and 'readings' / 'refluences'  -  intriguing though I've found recent
posts on such subjects. It talks about the processes of 'history' of how
what survives survives and how what is lost is sometimes that which is most
valuable.
 
            An ammended quote from a short, slack and unsatisfactory
snippet written for the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E issue of Open Letter locates part
of my own feelings (hard to believe I could say that), some of which I
retain, about the political economy of the cultural production and
consumption of the book:
 
           ' "Perfection - Constancy - Consistency are terms applicable to
a static state of affairs that this writer would wish to be considered
outside of" (allen fisher 'A Sketch Map of Heat')
            The size of the page that work is made on, the page as a site,
the texture of the paper to be printed on and its class pretentions towards
promoting substantiable meanings, its color (if any), the choice of
typography and more - all such active choices inform the work and such
choices form part of what can be read. . . Words are actions, they are part
of a physical process. . . to extract one element of this processual space
and reproduce the same extraction, say in a re-print or anthology is to
re-present rather than present. This is effect amounts to translation.'
 
            Not that translation should be anything other than encouraged,
but acknowledged, have its own process incorporated, be sensitized to the
poet's choice of presentation as some recent posts have carefully,
documented. Thanks for those.
 
            Also consider the ambience of the reader's location  -  like
Tenney's tale of reading Olson on the A Train or whatever  -  works written
to interfuse with environment or encouraging expansion of consciousness.
 
            Consider the likening of the potential of these e-spaces for
re-integration of word and image  -  (yeah I know the arguments re- Caxton
primacy of print out of economic and technological imperatives and the
connections being made both positively and negatively regarding
e-Medivalism (sic)).
 
            Check out the work that John Cayley, and I hope others are (I
just don't know you), making for this environment. And the somewhat stalled
but clearly related, soon hopefully becoming more stimulating, discussions
on hyper-text composition on ht-lit.
 
            One thing that irks at present is the relative normalising
influence of electronic presentations in spaces such as these. I printed
out RIF/T when I clocked on here and found the layout (not the writing)
dull (no disrespect to the editors who must be slightly frustrated in their
ambition as yet) - with all the typographical possibilites available for
DTP innovation we speak here in a 'normalised', formally relatively
controlled and limited e-space. That's part of the problem with it's
strained physicality (how comfy is your chair and does your screen
periphereyes your vision?).
 
            Consider the possible inter-relations between printed matter
and e-publishing?
 
            I haven't got far yet but am currently improvising, in short
takes, from postings (including those on this list  -  issues of ownership
anyone?) into a dictaphone which I also carry when out driving or walking
and whatever. The materials are then written (by hand) in notebooks with
keen attention given to emphasis and re-invented when necessary. These
materials become typed onto word processing formats and transferred into
DTP packages (I use Claris and Quark). I then print out and sometimes (not
always) blu-tack the printed pages (large font size) up on a wall in a kind
of grid which is then re-improvised from onto cassette and re-transcribed.
I use choices from all stages of such a process to compose the 'poem'.
Sometimes these texts go on to form elements of performance work. Some is
printed  -  other versions are released on CD in spoken word or soundwork
contexts  -  other versions might be appropriate for electronic
presentation. The point is process and version. Somehow that leads back to
the top of this post and 'The Traces of Thomas Hariot' re - issues of
posterity and the market forces which exxxxcercise their imperatives onto
choice and 'what remains' or 'residues' its presence.
 
(that's my quid's worth on personal working processes  -  well actually I'm
thinking more in peso's now since a lot of my time over the past week's
been taken up with followng the unravelling of events in Mexico re Chiapas
after being alerted by Robert Harrison's extraordinary post 'A REAL
Political Poet')
 
          o when the sandwich has been cut
          e and when the architect arrives

                   upon the same
 
love

Notice how the disscussion of close reading has
 
led us to Blakean picture books and away from themes.
We moderns are so easily led to privilege sight.  Or, not wanting to be seen
privileging anything, we claim that means of productions, physicality and
sight are bonus themes and theme enhancers.
 
Spencer Selby's fine new book (thanks Spencer!), Malleable Cast--Generator,
might be a good thing to discuss in this context, for it carries the moniker
Art/Visual Poetry on the jacket.  Everyone please buy this book, look at it,
and have your close reading prepared for class next monday.  The thesis
statement must contain the following words:  advertising, early modern, DPT,
Charles Alexandrian, seepage, and icon template.
