This internet is mind-boggling. Just as I put out my call for material for
my CagePage I, purely by *chance* stumbled across a trove of Cage material,
as well as New Music sites. Never think that something hasn't already been
done out there on the net--the vastness both numbs & juices the mind. So, I
will continue to built my CagePage and again, I ask all of you out there
who have written about Cage to email me material so we can build yet
another resource, with its own particular slant, whatever that may be. Any
material is acceptable--old or new--published or unpublished. Multiplicity
and abundance continue to be the guiding principles here.

Hi Marisa:
 
How 'bout E.E. Cummings?  He's kind of "The Great Lost Modernist," having
gotten lost somewhere between, say, Pound and Stein, but his work manages to
incorporate proto-language tactics (look at that bent syntax!),
concrete-visual layouts (most of his poems fit on one page, and, as he
referred to himself as a "poet-painter", he worked diligently on their
shape) *and* sound-poetry (his transcriptions of New York and Boston
tough-guy dialects are quite funny).  And when he transcends his upper-class
racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, homophobia and just plain sentimentality, his
astounding lyricism can transport his work to a really deep connection with
the earth.  Unfortunately, as Jack Foley once told me, "most people get into
Cummings when they're 16, and so they leave him behind when they leave their
16-year-old selves behind."

If you think that it's impossible to be wild and unrestrained while wearing a
tux, then you've been hanging out with the wrong crowd :-)
 
More seriously, isn't the Internet big enough for both? I mean, places with
formal controls (such as a moderated list) should be able to coexist with the
"wild and unrestrained" (alt.let.it.all.hang.out). In real life, one can wear a
dinner suit to a ball on Saturday night, then wear jeans to brunch on Sunday.
Why not on the Internet?
 
Formality can give freedom. For instance, learning how to tie a bow tie and
what to do with one's wing collars gives one the freedom to attend formal
occasions, without losing one's ability to wear jeans. Conforming with the
stylistic rules of an online journal gives one the right to contribute to the
discourse of the journal, without losing the right to slum it on IRC.
 
Maybe there's an analogy in poetry. Learn the rules, _then_ break them. Perhaps
sequences such as _Jerusalem Sonnets_, _Willy's Gazette_, _Sonnets for Carlos_
and _Blue Irises_ (sorry about the parochial examples) would lack some of their
power if they hadn't had the formality of the sonnet form for the poems to
struggle against and subvert. One can knock a wall down, or dig underneath it,
or look for a hidden door, or climb it and admire the view. The absence of
rules is _not_ the key to freedom, despite what Lindsay Perigo (another
provincial reference) might say.
 
Of course, no-one wants to wear a dinner suit every day, or write in rhyming
couplets all the time, or have the cybercops breathing down their necks. One of
the reasons that I admire Edwin Morgan is that he can write something as
formal as _Glasgow Sonnets_, and then experiment with concrete and sound
poetry. I hope the `tux forces' (although to me, a dinner suit conjures up
associations of glamour and flamboyance - how about `grey flannel Brooks
Brothers suit forces'?) keep their grubby hands and small minds off the net;
but I still see a place for formal, regulated spaces on the Internet.
 
        Your humble servant,
 
                Tom Beard
                (loosening the half-Windsor knot on his tie
                 as 5:30 approaches)
 
 
P.S. Have you ever turned up to a function (opera, film premiere etc) wearing a
dinner suit, only to find everyone else wearing jeans? One wonders now who is
orthodox and who heterodox.

Hi Steve, and everyone:
 
cummings!  Well anyway, Laura Riding agreed with you, in about 1924, when the
critics remembered cummings had grazed in the Loygardens @1916....when
Mina Loy, via Paris and Florence, was helping to bring the 'poet-painter'
concept alive in New York....
 
But it's funny you should bring him up; he's the writer I was thinking of
through the whole 'sentimentality' thread, and he's unbearable (on for
instance prostitutes), but there *is* something in cummings-- a lyricism
like there is in Berrigan maybe-- that I feel I can't do without.  So lately I
was waving some new poetry around and saying "I want what cummings had"
which is probably *not* what Tony Green means by taking up the chisel on behalf
of one's students.....the contrivance of lush feeling
 
This was, by the way, an isolated incident....   --------Marisa

Subject:      new web site
 
Announcing a new World Wide Web initiative to stimulate critical discussion
and debate on aesthetics and technology as these cultural components
continue to influence each other at the end of the twentieth century.  A
fresh writing project on the Web called "Infusion" will soon begin
publishing in electronic form.  Essays and reviews are now being solicited
on electronic art in general or any topic concerning the place and effect
of aesthetic theory within electronic media.  Questions and responses can
be mailed to either my e-mail address: klobucar@unixg.ubc or that of the
site on which Infusion will be run - front@wimsey.com.  The address of the
magazine is as follows: http://www.wimsey.com/~front/infusion.  Comments
and criticism appreciated.
 
Infusion is designed to facilitate a more informed and critical awareness of
cultural production on the internet. Reviews and discussions of various
internet sites will follow, each one providing its own series of
hypertextual links to the actual site under investigation. Emphasised
within these writings are the radically new conceptions of both space and
time endemic to the medium of cyberspace itself. Not in any way bound by
traditional, institutional demarcations between the artwork and its
critique, the reviews that originate at this site will feature a much more
interactive model of comment and analysis. These writings will seek ideally
to interconnect with their own objects of critique, providing more than
just commentary or general criticism: Infusion will remain, above all, an
exercise in critical engagement. The electronic medium of the internet
inspires a whole series of new challenges for the contemporary cultural
worker. The very technology itself demands different skills and objectives
within the cultural sphere. Those who choose to ignore these changes run
the risk of seriously limiting their respective social "voices". A new
media framework requires new social responses. It is hoped, therefore, that
the following electronic spaces will collectively provide a suitable
discourse for creative,thoughtful reflection befitting these technologies.

The second we stopped sending messages with the header "sentimentality" the

Books. (It's a pretty great read, modelled apparently on the old New
Directions annuals. Writers from the publisher's list and then writers the
publisher admires all in one handy book--does anyone know if S&M plans to do
this again?)

poem by Charles Henri Ford (That's where the ND feeling comes from), Celine

David Bromige, etc., etc.
 
If you buy only three anthologies from Sun & Moon this year...
(Could somebody say a little about _I Novissimi_, the Giuliani anthology from
S&M? I'm, as they say in the back of the magazines, curious...)

          I just got back from the audiologist.  I have had ringing in
          my left ear for two months now.  One of the audio tests they
          did with me was to speak words into my headphones and have
          me repeat the words (and to guess at the word if I didn't
          hear the word clearly).  So the audiologist is pronouncing
          words in my ear and I'm repeating them out loud.  But what
          is happening with me is I'm trying to figure out what the
          pattern is to the words they're using and then when I had
          trouble hearing the words I thought of it as an auditory
          Rorschach test (at one point I said "shotgun" to what
          sounded like "shotgun" to me, but by that time I had also
          figured out somewhat of a pattern and that was: the words
          related to children: playground, school, etc. and I was
          throwing "shotgun" into that mix!).  At one point all I
          heard was a phoneme and repeated that.  Before I latched on
          to the idea that these words related to children, I tried to
          make a narrative out of the words and I tried to figure out
          what different sounds these words made and what that pattern
          might be.  I also wondered who made up the words because
          even though they were certainly throwing these words at me
          for their SOUND value they also have meanings attached to
          them that resonate in your brain as your repeating them out
          loud.  All in awl, a very interesting experience.

Jordan's comments on the Sun & Moon _50_ anthology _almost_ make me wish
I'd picked that up instead of their _Gertrude Stein Awards in Innovative
American Poetry 1993/94_.  But not quite.
 
It's a good digest of various current scenes (though there're things I'd
have liked to see included that aren't) drawn from magazines, most of which
don't show up in Seattle.  &, a real breakthrough here, NAFTA in action, it
includes Canadians and, I think, one Mexican as "Americans."  's about
time, eh?
 
But really, I just wanted to say that Jordan's use of the abbreviation S&M
for Sun & Moon reminded me of the blue M&M I had yesterday.  They're a
darker blue than I'd expected, replacing the light brown ones.
 
For the Canadians on the list, M&M's are kind of like the candy <Smarties>.
I don't know the equivalent in other countries.

Anybody ever heard cummings read? There's actually a small clip
of him reading pretty how town on Encarta for cd-rom. His voice
and its natural rhythm are very lyrical to begin with (breath of
line is quite honest, I think). He sounds like a hybrid of
W.C. Fields and the voice of Winnie the Pooh. How fictionally
appropriate.

One of the wonderful fruits of John's coming to Cincinnati was that he
became acquainted with Jeanne Kirstein, who was a Pianist In Residence
at the Conservatory (part of U.C.) (and wife of Jack Kirstein, then cellist
with the LaSalle Quartet.)  John fell in love with how Jeanne played his
pieces, and chose her to record for Columbia "The Early Piano Music of
John Cage". During the time of recording in New York, on one of her returns to
Cincinnati, Jeanne told me that one day, as they were listening to a
playback, John said to her in a somewhat wistful tone, "This makes me
realize that I could have been a composer."

Tony, sorry it took me so long to reply, but I had a reading to
get ready for, which was helpful.
I really, reallly enjoyed your post, and I think you've articulated
something I've felt while writing.
I have several poems in which I deal with this issue,and while
I was getting ready to read I noticed I formally treat influence
through parataxis or an angular jarring of styles, I suppose like
language poetry, only style is the unit of interrogation.  It strikes
me that the result is violent, as in fusion or fission, and this is
the noise of the self and its tongue reconfiguring to accomodate
personnae, love and whatever else is engaged.  I think this is
where Ondaatje's verse about "a spine" being bred is born.
It seems language can't just be "the furniture in the room" becase
the process doesn't feel that benign. Of course, this is assuming
we can say history and influence can be thought of as "other" in
Spicer's system.
Hmmm.

Ryan

The abreviation S&M would never make me think M&Ms, Herb.

There's almost 200 minutes of Cummings on two Caedmon releases recorded c.
1940 and c. 1960, and issued in 1975: poems, bits of plays and a section
from _Eimi_, his Soviet travel journal.  And that's not including the
nonlectures, which are also out there somewhere.  You pegged his voice
perfectly, Ryan.
 
How many know that Cummings was one of the first American painters to be
identified with the Cubists?  There's an excellent book by Milton A Cohen
called _Poet and Painter:  The Aesthetics of E.E. Cummings' Early Work_ that
traces the development of EEC's work in both media and explains why he came
to be seen as more experimental in his poetry and less so in his painting as
time went on. It's on Wayne State University Press.

As  a librarian I suffer from information overload so tend not to read
too many "general" mags on a regular basis (in the UK so many of  them
are  just packaging jobs anyway), just specifics in a different field.
BBC  Music  Magazine  Earthcare  (because  it's  there)  The  European
(bi-weekly  with  really eccentric sports coverage) The Gramophone New
Scientist Private Eye and World Wildlife are in the recent scan pile.
 
Different  field:  The  Ecologist European Access European Urban and
Regional Studies Musical Quarterly The Strad, again, recent scans.
 
And some from the world of lit:
Fragmente  (new  issue  just  out,  ed. Anthony Mellors, English Dept,
Durham University, try the new poems by  Harriet  Tarlo,  Tony  Lopez,
Peter Middleton etc).
Object  Permanence  (new  issue due July, ed. Peter Manson Flat 3/2 16
Ancroft St Maryhill Glasgow G20 7HU).
Mandorla (ed. Roberto Tejada was through Durham last week, his address
Apartado  postal 5-366 Mexico DF, Mexico 06500) nice-looking bilingual
Spanish/English job.
And although I can't read it I do enjoy scanning:
Literatura  na  Swiecie  (ed.  Piotr  Sommer,  ul. Zgoda 9m.42, 00-018
Warsaw). All in  Polish,  carefully  produced  translations  of  world
writers  from a national and ideological range which wd certainly lead
to a great fight were they ever to have a L.naS christmas party...

I like to "think the reverse" whenever possible and even if not:
 
break 'em enough times you won't have to learn 'em, or the rules will have
changed, or you will change them, or make up your own rules and don't follow
those either; anyway whose rules are they?, I didn't see the signs, musta
missed them in the duststorm; or as we say in Medias Res (Medias Res, Nevada)
-- rope 'em and then learn 'em, shoot 'em and then cook 'em (chop up fine
before marinading indefinitely), float jerkily and carry a Bic pen at all
times, where aim I?, is this my fear / or did I just step into the public
sphere?, are you there Mordred?; Give me your tired tuxes, your tattered
nabobs of oligarchy yearning to Keep that Smut Off the Net, Thank you Sen.
Exxon the open spaces around here were scaring me, how many syllables can you
fit on the head of a pin cushion? what's that spell, Mario? who are you
calling a verse?  That's not what I meant y'all, not what I meant at all.

IN MEDIAS RES
 
 
 The mere word 'freedom' is the only one that still excites me.  The verb to
be admits the assertion.  I don't believe in automatic writing either as a
literal possibility or as a utopian or propagandistic literary value.   There
is no such place as the economy, the self.  And if anything, the kind of
'dream logic' juxtapositions that characterize much surrealistic work seem to
me a candied souping up of traditional literariness, especially in so far as
has been drawn upon in so much post-war American poetry (of what has been
called 'the bird flew through my pillow' sort).
 This is the right occasion to recall that the unconscious that all true
poetry calls upon is the receptacle of original relationships that bind us to
nature. This is not a sentence.  The words merely crawl across the page,
leaving a trail of syntax.  It is not the sky we mean, but the past, a
non-existent wall.  Everything happens as though, prior to the secondary
scattering of life, there was a knotty primal unity whose gleam poets have
honed in on. Yet the narrative crosses the garden, cool and damp.
 I guess it's a certain kind of depth of field that surrealist eery
dreaminess highlights that I would prefer to see diminished or framed.
 Little nicks in the silence come to a period.   Within us, all the ages of
mankind.  Within us, all human kind.  Within us, animal, vegetable, mineral.
 To try and tell a story is to make a purgatory of the real.
  Mankind, distracted by its activities, delighted by what is useful, has
lost the sense of that fraternity.  These words scratched my way slowly into
existence.  Clarity is an effect operating on the reader that has more to do
with hypnosis than understanding.  The purpose of the work was the
transformation of the worker.   No such thing as a phrase.
    The earth, draped in its verdant cloak, makes as little impression upon
me as a ghost. I have no conception of what I have to say which I then want
to put into writing.  The writing itself shows me what I have to say, and
it's always news to me.
 I use chance as a discipline, to free my mind, my ego, from my likes and
dislikes, so that I can flow with a larger set than I comprise.  The idea of
getting all the material in a poem totally 'spontaneously' from my 'self'
seems boring to me - my interest in writing is to be able to incorporate
material from disparate places.  The image is a pure creation of the mind.
 It is living and ceasing to live that are imaginary solutions.  Insist on
what's present (broken glass, nearly powdered) - a drunken man,
half-sleeping, at the feet of two cops.  Crushed plastic orange juice bottle
- there's no horizon in a tunnel.  Existence is elsewhere.

I can't agree with you more.  As as prose writer, I always feel fortunate
that I never had a single course in prose writing (beyond Freshman comp),
particularly how to write a short story.  Sometimes in writing I think it
is very useful to have something to write against, but it brings shivers of
revulsion (Kevin recently reread Powers of Horror for his Blaser talk, so
JK is on my mind) to think of me having this spectre of traditional
narrative and plot structure and character development (this is much worst
than the skin on the top of old milk, uurrrrghhhhfffffff!) to settle my
stomach over.  I've got plenty else to think about in structuring my work.
I basically learned to write through imitation, and I often had no idea in
the beginning why I was doing much of what I was doing in narrative.  I saw
somebody else doing it and I thought it was neat, so I'd try it.
Particularly I copied techniques of a very talented schizophrenic woman in
Bob Gluck's writing workshop--transcending linearity was like breathing for
her, while I was at home pulling my hair out over it.
 
Now I could give a theoretical rationalization for everything I do, but the
theory came later (and deepened my work, I think)--again, I approached it
always from a gut level.  I read theory to find more neat things, most of
the neat things I found were in art and psychoanalytic film theory rather
than in literary theory.  I usually feel much more akin to what's going on
in the art world than in the writing world, plus it was easier to seize and
adapt neat things that were tangential to what I was doing.
 
I should be honest and say that Bob Gluck was guiding me through this
process, but usually in his kitchen rather than in the writing workshop.
Scooping salmon patties from a frying pan, he would give me gentle little
nudges like, "Dodie, if you take the personal and push it as far as you
can, it becomes universal."
 
In my own writing workshop I've had students who were amazingly well-versed
in theory, but who wouldn't have a clue as to how apply that knowledge to
their own work.  It's like teaching somebody grammar and then expecting
them to speak English.  It ain't gonna happen that way.
 
"Learn the rules then break" them sounds like such a militaristic approach
to innovation.
 
xox,
Dodie B.

as some of you may know, cris cheek has attempted to put together a mail

noted to me that he is without a system which receives and forwards posts
to a group (apologies for lack of technical language here -- i'm new to
all of this); however,
 
i've talked with some people here at sfu and it's possible to establish a
mail list which would focus on this form of poetry. based on my few
exchanges with cris, i am aware that there is an interest for this. so,
to take this one step further, anyone interested in being a part of a
discussion group on visual/concrete poetry please let me know via
back-channel. if the interest in there there is certainly no problem in
proceeding. perhaps one of the issues which can be explored here in
regards to this poetry is poetic collaboration on the net... i know there
has been some interest expressed in that of late

Steve, anyone with a web-browser can read the archived wisdom of this list
at the EPC.
 
This explains why, recently, so many books by George Bowering have been
turning up in used book stores around the world.  Hole fans have been
de-accessioning his works since word got out that he doesn't like the band.
 
 
So check out those bargains in the alternative CanLit section of your local
book store today.

Actually, we're still in the clear! They didn't give out the Poetics

Thanks for the poem, Thoreau.  Reminds me of "Borges and I" (you know, the
one by Borges).  Writing seen as a kind of extremification of the experience
of identity moving through vastly different spaces in the psyche, yet
somehow maintaining a thread of unity (Amazingly.) Or sometimes not.  A kind
of Multiple Personality Order.

Hi everyone; I've been saving this clipping for you electric entities for
three days now:
 
 Karen Finley's doing Martha Stewart in nightclub performance
 
"'I won't actually play Martha,' she said yesterday [to a New York Times
guy], 'but I will take her spirit and go over the top with it.'"
 
There's also a book involved, but I'm thinking it can't be better than the
one about cats who paint.

Subject:      Re: Think the Reverse
 
There are rules as prescriptions, which in the arts are never better
than rules of thumb for tiros -- knights before bishops, castle
early  -- , these are broken commonly and necessarily as occasion
demands. Occasion's demands get met by what though ---  a routine
consideration of known options accumulated from other seemingly like
occasions?  That's the hidden face of accumulated internalised rules
of procedure called experience?
 
The rules problem is at its worst in the first formulations of
academies, especially where it is recognised that no rules can meet
every occasion. Our common (on this lists recent posts anyway)
unwillingness to countenance rules is like the familiar cry of
Romantics faced with the authority of  academies in the 18/19th
centuries, all hardened up for us by Modernist revolts.  Rules are
maybe now not so important as knowing strategies for working with
writing and publishing.  That's often an interesting matter for this
list. But how to write how to read how to de-stress how to bring up
your baby how to deal with any number of problems on the non-fiction
shelves is all to do with finding rules with allowances for
occasional individual variations:  the usual foundations of a
discipline.  Teachers get stuck with it easily.  "Give us a rule so we
can please you to get good grades".  I have students who complain
that I "set essay topics" that are too broad and leave too much
freedom of choice.  I should be more "directive".  The answer could
be not rules, but motivation. "Once you know what you want, maybe you can
think of a way to get it".   I like thinking the reverse, obverse,
perverse too.
 
If your organs were available for easy transfer to
another, and you could choose, would you offer parts in the personal
column of the local paper, or go down to the supermarket and offer,
say, your brain, to a casual passer-by that looks like they could use
it?  This is a perplexing topic that I discussed with a friend at the
weekend.  Anyone who could draw up rules for this situation please
advise.

in high school i wrote a short story about a guy who, believing himself the
ultimate philanthropist, gave away his body parts one by one to deserving
individuals in need, replacing them with mechanical parts (he was rich enough to
do this medically, but thought simply giving money away a "cheap" sort of
philanthropy).  he believed that as he physically became more mechanical, he was
in fact --metaphysically, though of course i didn't use the term at the time
--becoming more "human," in the sense of "humane," --more of a mensh, which, of
course, means person.  the writing wasn't that good (telos/theme driven) but i
still think the idea's kinda cool.  --md

Hi  M a r i a,  given the difficulties and perhaps serious
disaadvantages that my friend and I work
under (regarding brains), we were
not sure that the offer of them as
spare parts to others would be
philanthropic: but it is more than
a little interesting that your giver-figure made a sacrifice that was
not a sacrifice and regarded what he was giving up as of useful
significance. We were thinking perhaps more of exchanges. I will
relay your reply to my friend, Pamela Honum who is not
on e-mail.  Thank you for the information. I'd love to see the story.

Hi.  New to this list, and it seems traditional to at least say hi.
That done:
Buckminster Fuller writes:
 
In short, physics has discovered
That there are no solids,
No continuous surfaces,
No straight lines;
Only waves,
No things,
Only energy event complexes,
Only behaviors,
Only verbs,
Only relationships.
 
I like that.  I like physics.  Physics makes theory into art--or maybe I
mean to say art out of theory. . . which is what I am currently trying to
do w/ my own poems--including working on a "love" poem out of the above.
In physics, the rules are the art, and I shudder at the thought of losing
such precious babies hastily tossing out any bathwater. . .
 
good to be here on this provocative list--
ShaunAnne

i remember in art school they always told us: "learn to draw before you
abstract." i always hated that. i felt there were other ways of drawing,
that what was important (at least for me, then -- and now) was process,
the knowing&unknowing of the act, the moment of the act of doing and
undoing. it's taken a few degrees but i think, for the most part, i've
gotten rid of that rule, ironically: "learn to draw before you abstract."
reading and poetry had a lot to with that -- saving me... ...i mean.
to learn to draw i learnt to write
 
when i went to graduate school i worked with a professor who taught
drawing and sculpture. one semester in a drawing course he gave he
wouldn't let anyone _draw_ -- that is, _draw_ with pen or pencil on
paper, nothing like that. what they did was for the whole term they just
talked about drawing, and they studied the etymology of the word. he was
adament abt this, too, because if he noticed you "regressing" and
starting to draw he'd fail 'ya! no one failed. fact, i think he gave
everyone all _A_s. well desrved, too. i saw their work in an exhibition at
the close of the year. it was stunning!

Subject:      The Written Record...
 
                        The Written Record...
 
Evidence  brought  to  light  in  April  this  year  by Andrew Crozier
(University of Sussex) now demonstrates that the  essay  published  by
the  Basil  Bunting  Poetry  Centre  under  the  title of _The Written
Record..._ is not in fact by Basil Bunting, but by "Roger Kaigh",  the
pseudonym  of  Louis  Zukofsky's  friend  Irving  Kaplan. The essay is
concerned with the unreliability of the written record... Dr.  Crozier
will  publish  his work on the origins and ascription of this paper in
due course; meanwhile the Directors of the Bunting Centre  issue  this
statement to avoid further confusion.
 
The  essay  was purchased, together with a group of papers by Bunting,
Zukofsky and others, from the Bunting  estate  in  1988.  Its  initial
identification  was made by Peter Makin, Peter Quartermain and Richard
Caddel at that time, on the strength of the circumstancial evidence of
its  discovery,  and  its  contents.  Any  confusion  caused  by  this
premature  judgement  is  very  much  regretted.  The  essay  has been
available in the Basil Bunting Poetry Archive  -  where  it  has  been
consulted  by numerous Bunting and Zukofsky scholars - since 1988, and
since March 1994 it has  been  available  in  published  form  in  the
Centre's  publication  _Three  Essays_.  At no time has its ascription
been queried.
 
We  are therefore grateful to Dr. Crozier for identifying the piece as
"Paper" by Roger Kaigh (referred to and quoted from by Louis  Zukofsky
in his own essay "American Poetry 1920-1930"), and for his work on the
Kaigh/Kaplan-Zukofsky   connection.  It  still  remains  a  matter  of
conjecture how the piece, without its title  page,  or  any  authorial
statement,  came  to be in Bunting's possession, but its importance to
him - demonstrated in the other pieces in _Three Essays_ - is evident.
 
We  are  pleased that the piece has now been correctly identified, and
that an important unpublished paper which had been thought lost is now
identified and accessible. We are of  course  also  eager  to  contact
Irving Kaplan or his heirs at an early stage.

It was really good (to my eyes) to see ShaunAnne's introductory message,
and its reference to and quotation from Buckminster Fuller. ShaunAnne,
are you a Bucky fan? I am. Does anyone on the list read his poetry, or
interest themselves in his importance to poetry? Zukofsky, I know, cited
his work, as did John Cage. Anyone know any other examples? (oh, also,
anyone interested in the slightly hushed-up aspect of Fuller's enthusing
about marriage and relationships but in fact being a philanderer - as he
admits in an interview in Martin somebody's book on him - that is, that
Fuller didn't, unusually for him, incorporate his *practice* in the area
of sexual relationships into his general *theory*, but still talked as if
he believed in (and practised) monogamy, as if monogamy was more aligned
to his *theory* than polygamy...)
 
Anyway, I for one want to welcome ShaunAnne to the list,

one problem with the new physics poem is that you cannot use the word 'only'
because it doesnt qualify as a verb so you cannot have a new physics poem with
the line 'only verbs' and that is too bad because it would be nice for new
physics poems to be self-referential just like most other old physics poems.
 
but ShuAnn i do want to see your verb-rich (straightline-poor) love poem.

It's funny, Maria, but I didn't suspect that Burt's post was unfriendly.  I
guess chaos and fuzzy logic are okay by me.

Not to take an oblique tack on this issue (which I think started out as a

and not as a response to a question-- a _very_ Stalinist move, I thought,
Charles) but rather than ignore everything and hope that by so doing we won't
have to learn anything, might it not be more pleasing to make up or

No, I don't read B. Fuller, as of yet!  Looks like I should.  However all
of this will have to wait as I am currently studying for comps!
 
I like the thoughts re: only not qualitfying a verb, and that why can't
new physics be self-referential as was old physics--I ask in return, can
anything be self-referential in the pomo, that is, to my mind, the here
and now?
Some might argue that we can only be self-referential. . .
I'm interested in anyone's thoughts here.
 
I also think of Calvin (of comic strip fame) "verbing" words (like when
you send something in any big city via bicycle messenger, you "messenger"
it)--this seems distinctly pomo.  I see the pomo as distinguished by a
sense of timelessness; hence, verbing words seems so very appropriate.
 
Also connecting physics and poetry. . .
But now I'm soapboxing. . !
 
Finally, several expressed interest in seeing the poem, but I do not know
the etiquite on this list.  Do we post actual poems and discuss them, or
just [poetics in general?  I'm game for either, but do not want to upset
the format here!
 
Thanks for the warm welcome, all!

Words like 'constraints' and 'relationships' sound very much like rules to me.
Yes, physics is all about rules - whether we discover the rules that govern the
universe, or create rules to make useful predictions about our sense-data -
whichever way you look at it, we are looking for rules. That's what
intelligence is for.
 
Language is all about rules too - grammar, syntagmatic/paradigmatic
relationships, denotations, connotations (a meaning doesn't have to be in the
dictionary to constitute a rule of signification), genres, rhymes schemes. The
very fact that at least some of you (I hope) have some idea of what I'm talking
about means that we share some of these rules.
 
In creative writing, we are free to choose whatever rules we want for our work,
and them break them as we feel fit. Go ahead, write a sestina with one word on
each line (Dinah Hawken), an elegy consisting of a question with no question
mark (W.S. Merwin), a haiku that doesn't follow the 5-7-5 rule (just about
everyone). Your poem can gather up the tension that comes from straining
against its structures, and use it to its advantage.
 
There's no-one standing over you with a big gun, saying "thou shalt write in
iambic pentameter". At least, I hope there isn't. If there is, it's time to
inquire into what purposes (aesthetic, political, cultural, inertial) those
rules are serving. You may find the rules useful. You may want to challenge
them. Either way, you have learnt something.
 
We are subject to rules whenever we speak or act. It's to our advantage to
understand those rules, via theory, reading and/or experimentation. Then:
follow them, bend them, break them, change them, subvert them, or some
combination of the above. Unless we understand the rules, we will not have
these options.
 
        Tom.

Subject:      rules
 
Music resembles poetry, in each are nameless graces which no methods
teach and which a master hand alone can reach. If, where the rules
not far enough extend (since rules were made but to promote their
end) some lucky license answer to the full the intent proposed, that
license is a rule.
 
In other words, make up your own rules.
 
 Don't worry too much about breaking them. Someone else will take
 care of that. Something there is that doesn't love a rule.
 
By the way, is the rule when reading Olson that I have to draw a
breath inward every time I drop down a line? Is the dizziness that
results from hyperventilation when this is tried supposed to be part
of the poem? Is it permissible to break Olson's rules while reading
his rule-breaking poetry? Or is that against the rule?
 
Sometimes it is hard to get clear answers. I once asked a specialist
in Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound" what it was all about. The reply
was, "I cannot answer that question in the face of obvious
hostility."
 
It was Shelley who set us all going about rules. "Poets are the
unacknowledged legislators of the world."

Carl Lynden Peters comments on learning "Drawing" before doing
"Abstraction" are echoed throughout a cautious middle-ground view of
artists like Picasso who learnt academic practice "the rules" BEFORE going off
the rails. Is Gertrude Stein some poetic equivalent, learning the
rules of syntax BEFORE writing unpublishable "distortions".
 
A
painter friend claims to have avoided art school drawing practice
"from the model" from the very beginning, knowing that what he wanted
to do was make "abstract painting". Nobody has ever seemed to notice
that he was disadvantaged by the lack of "drawing". His work,
however, has always been located  within  the "abstract" tradition,
i.e.the governing principles, or Rules, that could be ellicited from
the study of early modern abstraction (or later versions of same, say
1960's-70's abstraction).  Syntactic variation of standardized
communication patterns of syntax in writing has, as most people on
this list will know, a history or tradition.

Tom , you talk of sestinas and haiku and elegies and that's all fine. When
I said "what rules?" I meant to imply that no one is obliged to follow such
defined forms, even though the departures from the farm may be what ignites
the poem. One can, of course, and such poems can be dynamic. But I often
find that the work I read again and again makes its own structures, so that
part of the joy of reading is finding such structures, including how and
when and why they are followed and not followed. But when is making it up
oneself, it is difficult to think of the structures and forms one invents
as rules or constraints, rather they seem more like methods or even,
forbid, poetics.

off-list or back channel. Not much response to poems when they are posted
on the list, although such postings happen now and then. I don't know why

Dear Jordan,  what you suggest is really useful (about

Subject:      Fuzzy Logic Poetics
 
The concept of "a poetics of chaos or fuzzy logic" is not just a serious
idea, it is an actuality.  There is no "uncertainty principle" in a poem that
appears in print in the sense that one is not in doubt as to whether a
particular word or phrase does or does not occur in the poem.  For hypertext
or other forms of interactive work, the situation is quite different.  There
may be no guarantee that a reader will *arrive* at any given lexia.  The
software may or may not allow sequential access to "all" the lexia.  So now
we face the question:  how do we know that a given phrase is actually present
in the work?  There is only a *probability* that it will be encountered.
Fuzzy logic poetics is a very exact description of what happens here.  The
situation gets even more elaborate with algorithmically generated work like
John Cayley's.  Where the text is generated on the fly by an algorithm,
uncertainty is even greater.
 
[For those not familiar with hypertext rhetoric terminology, 'lexia' is a
term borrowed by George Landow from Barthes to describe the "nodes" in a
hypertext.  Of course, some of us question the fixity of this concept.]

I find I've been reading the New Yorker a lot lately too.
I liked Holman's reaction to Ginsberg's optimism.
As usual I got something from the minuscule bits of poetry that were screened
through the prose.
The piece really reminded me of the kind of profile Rick Rubin (name?) used
to get when rap was new and Def Jam didn't have comedy installed in its
middle yet. I.E. there are these black performers and they're all right but
let's talk to the promoter, the mastermind. I _like_ Bob Holman. I just
thought it was a curiously journalistic piece.

To me, the term "a poetics of fuzzy logic" is less than appealing. The
reason is that the word "logic" in the phrase, resonant of "logical,"
implies that there is some desired goal. (Isn't fuzzy logic _in part_
used to help you, say, find information when you don't quite know what
you are asking for?) "Fuzzy" also implies a lack of precision, which I
do not think is a fair critique of a poetic text.
 
Another distinction is very important. In my writing about this topic,
I have always distinguished between "closed" hypertextual systems (a
diskette for example and a program specifically used to run the
hypertext) and an "open" system, say such hypertextual works as
occurring on the Net, where the software is "generic" and the
"peformance" or presentation of the work can occur in multiple
situations.
 
As to whether a reader has access to the full lexia; depending on the
designer of the system (aka writer) this is not a matter of chance,
but squaring off to some of the assertions made by Landow and others,
it is a matter of the author's _intention_. Yes, such an intention
persists. What the text does allow is multiple possible readings; the
degree of this multiplicity is in the author's hands (and partly in the
software's).
 
Access to the lexia? Yes, it is more _marked_ here, i.e., there may be
entire sequences of text that by some choice the reader makes, she
will never arrive at. (Sort of like the standard film motif where
pausing once at a newsstand throws your cosmic timing off so that you
subsequently miss the chance bumping into your ideal mate by half a
second. Thus you spend your life lonely.)
 
However, the tension of hypertext should not convince one that this
partial lexia problem is limited to our technological space. Take for
example the book - and here two instances. Lexical meanings of words
the reader may miss because she does not know the word, does not
relate to the association the writer has intended, or has a strong
personal association that overrides the writer's. Second, thinking of
references within texts to other texts, not everyone can leap out of

I also wish to mention that RIF/T will issue, as part of its

Subject:      rules: rule or suck?
 
Hi all (and welcome Shaunanne):
 
Well, the world is marked by structure, and rules seem to "govern"
structure.  But structure is fluid, so the question is, when we break the
rules of a particular structure,  are we following a set of overarching
rules governing the fluidity of structure?  And if we are, can we live with
such rules, since they allow us so much freedom with regard to "subverting"
the rules of the level we're more used to being oppressed by them on?
 
I think of rules as useful learning tools.  It's true that some people's
intuition in some areas allows them to leap over the need to learn this way,
and that even those who do learn through rules will hopefully transcend the
need for them.  So maybe the only thing we need to require of rules is that
they do open out somewhere and let us continue down our path on our own.
 
I think this may be what Carl's professor (and zen, for that matter) was
trying to get at.  Once we've been acculturated and internalized the
culture's rules, we may need to work our way through them until we've
exhausted their particular logic, and only then can we burst out of them.
 
BTW, great poems Herb Levy (love that editing) and Shaunanne (is the title
related at all to the REM song, or should i be ashamed of myself for even
asking?)

Hey all:
 
I'm just remembering a book a friend from college long ago was excited on
finding a copy of.  It was a Bucky Fuller book which had 3 or 4 different
narrative threads all running simultaneously in different parts of each page
(e.g., one running across the center of each page, one in a different
typeface in the upper right ).  Anyone know what book I mean and what it's
called?

Contract with America limited edition underwear to be featured on
Lifetime Television's "Biggers & Summers" Talk Show
 
Artists Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese will present their
limited edition of "Contract with America" underwear on live
television Friday, June 23 at 11:00 AM EST. Their appearance on
Lifetime Television's new "Biggers & Summers" show will reach 64
Million viewers nationwide.
 
Since the inauguration of their highly successful limited edition
"Contract with America" underwear, news stories about the artists
have appeared in hundreds of newspapers, on radio and television
across the country. The limited edition briefs even brought an official
response from the Republican Party after the artists sent pairs to
President
Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich and
other elected officials in Washington, D.C.
 
The Associate Chief Counsel of the Republican National Committee
wrote the artists Rto discontinue [their] unauthorized use of the
Contract with
America logo and text immediately.S The ACLU Arts Censorship Project and
cooperating attorney Elizabeth McNamara of the law firm Lankenau, Kovner
and
Kurtz responded on behalf of the artists that Rthe art project is a
classic
example of political satire...The combined impression is clearly
humorous, and
obviously meant to parody the Contract with America."
 
The artists plan to print a second edition of 300 pairs of "Contract
with America" underwear (200 mens and 100 womens). The second
edition will sell for $50.00 per pair, plus $5.00 shipping and handling
charges and New York state sales tax, where applicable.
 
The "Biggers & Summers" Show is cablecast on channel 12 in
Manhattan and Brooklyn. It is rebroadcast on the West Coast at 11:00
AM Pacific coastal time, check local listings.
 
For more information contact Ligorano/Reese at (718) 782-9255.

hey, steve. the professor i referred to has had, continues to have, the
strongest, deepest influence in both my creative life and on my aspirations
to teach. i asked him once what influenced him the most in his teaching. "The
military," he said. --he served 2 or 4 tours of duty in Vietnam

I don't know Fuller's work very well, it might have been a book (can't
remember the name right now) published by Something Else Press.  But it
really could be any one of several books, you'll have to look them over and
see which one your friend had.
 
I thought of these off the top of my head, but, as I said, I don't know
Fuller's work.  I'm sure that others on the list could provide further
(and/or better) references.  (For instance, I recall another book like this
by Fuller with the words <Hannah Weiner> in the title, but I'm blocking on
the full title of it.)
 
<Panopticon by Steve McCaffery> by Buckminster Fuller
 
<Glas by Jacques Derrida> by Buckminster Fuller
 
and of course,
 
<_Homage to Creeley_>
<Explanatory Notes by Jack Spicer> by Buckminster Fuller
 
(There should be a full underline between the first three and the next two
words of this title.  This effect is not possible in terminal mode.
Sorry.)

Since we all seem to have respect for critique, could we start listing what
constitutes "fair critique"? I would suggest that some quality like accuracy
or precision can be attributed to a poem, and that someone who fancies that
quality might miss it in a "vague" or "abstract" poem. I myself like vague
and precise poems. However.
 
Also, Loss, is the interactive poem you mentioned the one compiled at the
EPC? Would it be possible for future contributors to the poem to see where
their lines go once they're written? (I mean, to access the poem in
progress?)
 
With love

Here's to O'Hara and the bit of solace he's given me:
 
It's just that it reminds
 
     God it must be 9:45 on a Tuesday
night bordering on evening at least
once a week in a lifetime of poetry
and once again i'm tipping my hat to the breeze
thinking bout those motes and tropes in the nooks of streets which
were somehow left behind. I didn't do it I think
and walk into Sophie's cause we agreed
it's the only place worth patronizing
for a muffin although I really want a donut
and I have coffee but it really isn't the same
as what I hoped for when I think of Sam's Diner
or an extinct species of time and place thereabouts.
     I don't know where anyone else came from here
but when I was born I distinctly remember I thought
lab coats were lovely and it would be very pleasant
for us all to wear them and our first impressions
on our sleeves and so I open the paper hoping
to see you in the funny pages but you haven't even left
a note and I think how good Rex Morgan is looking
these days despite his strips irreverence for
novelty or thereabouts.
     There's an Elvis impersonator outside
and two nylon kids are eating up to me
before giving the country the thumb and really
I just can't wait for Reg or George or someone
larger than this vinyl booth to shuffle in
and declare war on austerity in the service industry.
     And I just have to say to Frank and his absence
that when I think about you somewhere
there is grace in living as variously as possible
although I usually can't help but feel full and fed up
since my eyes are too big for my stomach
and so to you I must ultimately confess in all sincerity that I shouldn't
have ordered
the cosmos when it wasn't mine.

cosmologist, choreographer, visionary - celebrated for developing geodesic

I loved the gates piece (tho have only read the first half--obeying the rules

Good, cause I have some.. .:-)
 
I see postmodernism as distinguished by its self-conscious
self-referentiality.  I also see "the here and now as not reducible to the
postmodern, specifically with regards to this discussion, in that it
includes the self but doesn't refer all of what is back to the self.
 
>I also think of Calvin (of comic strip fame) "verbing" words (like when

Yes, I liked that cartoon; what I thought was interesting was Hobbes' (and,
I got the impression, Bill Watterson's) reaction, something to the effect
that, with this attitude toward language, soon we won't be able to
communicate through it anymore.  And yet, as Cummings saw so clearly, this
is one of the ways language generates new ways of communicating, and English
is, it seems to me, particularly adept at the trick of "verbing".  Cummings
was trying, in his own words, "to undress one by one the soggy nouns whose
agglomeration constitutes the mechanism of Normality, and finally to
liberate the actual crisp organic squirm--the IS" (from "Gaston Lachaise",
in _A Miscellany Revised_, October House, 1965, if anyone's interested.)
 
So it goes way back before pomo (unless you're using pomo as a synonym for
what is "ahead of its time", or "avant-garde", or whatever.)  What is pomo
is the emphasis on shifting the parts of speech of words, part of the pomo
project of blurring distinctions, although it's perfectly within the wider
syntactic "rules" of the English language to do so in this fashion.  But, I
ramble...

Friday night was a treat. Gary Sullivan and Curt Anderson and Anthony
Schlegel and Jonathan Brannen and Joel Kuszai and I all read works. Very
boyish indeed, as Marta Deike and Cheri Hickman forgot to bring their
works. I showed a video a group in Tucson, Video Art Network (there were
some women in that collective who helped make this video, including one,
the incomparable Nancy Solomon, whose stamp was evident), made as a
response to a poem of mine. Jonathan Brannen read, entire, his marvelous
Thing is an Anagram of Night, a densely philosophical work whose thinking
is firmly from the ground up, desire and wonder making time with the
universe. A few other non-poets were there as well, so the talk ranged from
writing to love to philosophy (one current student working on Lacan and
Deleuze had a lot to say) to music until about 2:30 in the morning. Cats
and children joined in the reading (not planned, but not unwelcome) as
well. Sorry you missed it, but I consider King Crimson a worthy alternative.

In which case the question might not be "what rules?" but "which rules?". In
reply to another post, language in its most utilitarian form is all about
following rules (that's why I used a comma in this sentence, and didn't spell
"rules" as "selur" or "roolz" or "gdztr"), and language in its more creative
forms is about breaking rules.
 
Of course, all uses of language fall somewhere on the following/breaking
continuum. One can write a prose poem that breaks all of the rules of "poetry"
as a Georgian might have defined it, but still follows the rules of the English
language. Or one could write a sound or concrete poem that follows none of the
rules of language, but is still based upon a formal structure of some kind.
Even aleatory poems are based upon some system of assigning dice throws (or
whatever) to language elements.

Another post asked "Is reading finding rules?" I'd say that reading is some
combination of finding/constructing rules. This is what human brains do
extremely well - find rules in complex, initially confusing data.

maybe they're all the same thing?

Acutally, I don't really care for it myself, and am certainly *NOT*
evangelizing for it; since the subject did come up -- in a context where
some folks weren't sure whether the reference was "serious", I wanted to
point out that the *concept* is out there, and yes it is serious.

No.  Fuzzy logic means a logic in which truth values are *probabilities* in
the range 0 to 1 rather than integers, such as the usual *exactly* 0 or 1 of
two-valued logic.  The issue is:  what are the implications for discourse if
we can only assess to a given probability whether something is "there" in
the work.  This really does have a direct correlation to certain things in
physics, where you may only be able to get a probability for a measurement.

This is getting a bit confused.  In every hypertext I've ever looked at, there
was no issue of "partial access" to a lexia.  Access is not at issue here.
When a hypertext is large, the number of *paths* explodes exponentially.  But
the reader *arrives at* a lexia via a path.  With linear writing, the only
way a reader can fail to arrive at a given word is to give up -- or skip
ahead.  But in a hypertext, one can fail to arrive at a lexia by simply not
having chosen a path that links its way there.  The issue is not access but
*coverage*.  Most literary hypertexts give you no way of telling whether or
not you've been to every lexia.  That means anyone discussing a hypertext
has only a *probability* that any given reader will happen to have encountered
the lexia in question.

These are valid points.  Lots of folks have argued that hypertext is more
like linear writing than some of the polemic would have it, and vice versa;
certainly intertextuality and hypertext are deeply related.  Still, without
trying to be too argumentative, there is more than just a difference of
degree if the "uncertainty factor" is inherent and pervasive rather than
the exception.

charles thanks, what a rich description of what must have been a rich night.  i
do wish i'd been able to come, since i --unlike most of the friends i mentioned
my evening w/ king crimson --didn't really know king c beyond a "sound" and a
reputation as artsy and eccentric. i  had fun too, though it took half-way into
the show to really grok the spirit and truly come alive with the jive  ("I DID")
it was an anthropological experience, great people-watching, and of course,
fripp belew and bruford and that bald guy are obviously really talented
musicians.  acid rock, as i realized when i went to see the long version of
woodstock last year, is a specialized genre.  tho as a kid i loved jefferson
airplane, country joe, vanilla fudge (anyone remember their great cover of the
supremes' you keep me hangin on, with oedipal ejaculations throughout ("mama?
i'll be good...")) etc (the west coast sound rather than the brits) i can see
how my elders would have felt mystified and excluded. king c: lots of lights and
movement, lots of dramatic shifts of tone, fripp has a great voice too, kinda
waily.
 
still, i'd have dug the equally (and less structured, it seems, as the state
theatre had assigned seating) bacchanalian apollonian/dionysian thrill of your
gathering.

on twentieth-century Sappho translations. I mentioned to her the

P.S. ShaunAnne, I liked your poem a lot, one of the ones I've most
enjoyed on the list while I've been on it. The Buckminster Fuller
references have interacted with editing I'm doing of a book to be
brought out by Cris Cheek; as I was proofing the opening piece,
something I wrote about painting and other things, I remembered
Buckminster Fuller's rule: there is no "up" and "down" in universe,
only "in" and "out" (ie an aeroplane doesn't go "up" into the sky,
it goes "out" from the planet, at a longer radius, then "comes in to
land" - one of the only bits of idiom Fuller approved of as
post-flat-earth-language). I noticed, reading through my piece, that
I'd used the line "its composite sunbeams bouncing off the north wall
five feet up from the ground and the west wall three feet up from
the ground". In other words I broke a rule I'd agreed to let Fuller
bind me by; I edited this to "five feet out from the ground" and
"three feet out from the ground". Interestingly, the body of the
piece accomodates the change quite comfortably, indicating to me
that my sense of space, and the construction of a description,
has actually radically subconsciously altered; instead of merely
being "pc" in vocabulary choice, which would perhaps be an example
of rule-following that is missing the consciousness-raising or
wider rationale of the rule, I have let a rule work its way in and
change and make other rules around it.
        Anyway, I "reprint" the piece below, as I'm adding it to a
section of my book entirely composed of pieces sent to POETICS, where
it fits best - and thus it now fits even better....
 
 
 
 
 
METAPHORS FOR THE SPACE OF MUSIC
 
 
 
Being with an assumption that good can be shown to be the best possible
course of interaction, to any new-born child, and add only as a rider that
a new-born child may yet test your notion of good. Encourage and do not
disapprove the thought-process of the child testing your notion of good,
discuss it and let it grow as a thing of imagination in the theatre of
your conversation, between you and the child. Thoughts are put into action
too soon only because too many of us cannot incarnate a theatre of
conversation, a place made by thought and only visible to thought and only
by thought may we sit in it or walk its boards. This is a shame. For in
that theatre a new born-child may be so moved by thought. In a common way,
all may too be moved by gesture and other language, but there is a cubist
composition called thought which is suggested by all the gestures in a
conversation (the conversation includes all we know of each other, including
what we have elicited as likely true of what we hear and see reported of
each other). The composition is not on one plane. It is a cubist composition,
with time in it. In some gestures, the light is of such and such a quality,
its composite sunbeams bouncing off the north wall five feet out from the
ground and the west wall three feet out from the ground, so picking up the
colours of those parts of the north wall and the west wall, themselves
being absorbed by those parts of the north wall and the west wall and
rebounding as from a mirror or from mud variably. In other gestures, the day
has moved on, the sunbeams hit different walls or new parts of the same walls,
less or more spongy, of new hue. In some gestures, the painter walks up to
the sitter to a nearness of four feet. In other gestures, the painter walks
back ten feet and eight feet to the right. On the flat surface of the
composition, all the gestures are recorded, but not in (one idea of)
proportion to each other. When it was early in the day, the painter, at a
nearness of four feet, drew the sitter's left cheek as the light of that
time of the day reflected on the sitter and the painter and the page; when
it was later in the day, the painter, having walked ten feet backwards and
eight feet to the right, drew the sitter's left eyebrow in the different
light of that time of the day, on whatever part of the page seemed to the
painter to invite that gesture to be drawn upon it. Thus the flat surface of
the composition on the page at the end of the day had drawn upon it a
line that had originated as a drawing of the sitter's left cheek and at
the same time also drawn on it a line that had originated as a drawing of the
sitter's left eyebrow; the latter line, on the flat page, was to the right
and *below* the former line. The composition was not a photo-lookalike. It
would be impossible to produce a photo that would look like the composition,
although both might have been of the sitter. One could picture the sitter in
her or his absence, by looking at the cubist composition, by taking each line
into one's mind, imagining each minus or plus close-up, compensating for
by adding to or subtracting from the saturation of light in the line, adjusting
left and right on the colour spectrum for hue. One would not thus make a photo
in one's mind. One would make a three-dimensional sculpture vibrating in
time, the fourth dimension. One would massage either the sitter's head or,
more accurately, the space exactly around the sitter's three-dimensional
outline, with the mind not the hand, as if there were hands in the mind
which there are. One would see light bouncing off the sitter, a whole day's
refracted beams, of many lengths and hues. If one had oneself been the
painter, one might hear all the sounds one had heard during that day,
bouncing in from the world and on the recycled breath carrying the unique
intonations and even sometimes formulations of that day. All moments
of all days are unique, and here there is a cubist composition which acts
as a mnemonic for remembering some. The cubist composition of thought in
the theatre of conversation is painted by all involved, each is
sitter and painter. There we test the notion of good we live. The new-born
child joins with us in showing such and such is part of good not evil, or
the new-born child contemplates doing something that is not good and, without
disapproval, I and the new-born child contemplate the contemplation, mentally,
in the theatre and thus the evil is only contemplated and not acted, and
the mental did no harm. Good is not a regulation accepted. It and evil
are embodied in the theatre, evil is shown to be short-term, for one can
spend one hour in the theatre and see much more than one: hour of imagined
time and space; one is long-term in order to sit or paint in the theatre;
by the dimensions of the theatre evil is only short-term and thus really
boring. The sitter is not the painter, the painter not the sitter, all are
not alike in the theatre; yet via Carl Rogers, Stanislavsky and Walter
Benjamin's communing almost to identity, I have got to the theatre, got
back there. In fact, when two meet (or more than two) and accept equally
the painter and the sitter within them, then starting out with the attempt
to identify from the inside (if you. like, via R, S or B) can be discarded.
and conversation begin. The theatre, or cubism, or R, S, or B, may get you
there, but they are not there. There is conversation.

To Steve Carll et al.:
 
Re.: "verbing" and other "transitizing of verbs inherent and/or verbs as
back-formationed nouns:
 
We today in English may have a proclivity for verbing because of our
sensibility, that is, our high-tech way of life demands an (to borrow
from the big man) "instanter" perceptual existence and because English
is the most analyzed (i.e., broken down into constituent parts) languane
[correction: language] in the world.
 
Let us compare with ancient Roman Latin. That Latin was highly inflected
or rather synthesized (the opposite of analyzed). Also, the ancient
writers did not even bother to show visual breaks between words (the
cursive script just flowed on and on and in Greek often wrapped to the next
line backwards, called boustrophedon [sp?] meaning like the route a plow and
its horse would take in the field--plowing meaning writing is a very old
metaphor, by the way]); so, thinking about rules (I digress here), I guess
the ancients had to be damn sensitive readers who found out the rules of the
writing as they went along.
 
Anyway, there are more discrete units in modern English.
 
Questions for all:
 
What was the frequency of neologism and hapax formation in the ancient inflected
world?
 
Does present-day avant-garde poetry (e.g. Language Poetry--or is this now
G3 status and thus relegated to the ancient mists of historical time) depend
more on new usages and the like than modern or older poetry?

Thanks.  And yes, quite measured--I suppose some kind of Shelleyan or
Wordsworthian "poet" (Measure is within) leaking out--was it WW who said
that we need measure to control the emotion?  (I should know that!)  I
don't know if it is always true for poetry, but it seem true inmy life!

I guess I was thinking about stmts like Patricia Waugh's: "Both feminism
and Postmodernism have extended our awareness that one of the effects of
modernity is that knowledge reflexively enters and shapes experience and
then is shaped by it in an unprecedentedly self-conscious fashion."
Which says to me a loss of self at the expense of knowledge, but sure
could be read as almost the opposite.
 
Anyway, this is not a pomo list!  I do appreciate your thoughts, though,
Steve, esp those on verbing being earlier than pomo.  I do see literary
modernism as the last gasp of modernity, and modernism, so perhaps
cummings gloming onto it is perfectly prophetic.

john--
 
i like the idea of "bedside reading" lists a lot also. however, the nature
of things on the net/mailing lists seems to be an ever-changing
proposition; the minute you try to capture something, it has a way of
eluding you. hence, the "bedside reading" was a March theme, and a
strongish one at that. (Loss had gone so far as to ask if i would "edit"
something to this effect each month--which i was/would be pleased to do.)
however, it played itself out and disappeared within a week or two. i put
up calls for more "bedside reading" lists but recieved no more responses.
so--i let it go.
 
if there is still interest, i would certainly continue with my
accumulations, as long as people post/email "bedside reading" material. i'm
happy to oblige.
 
thanks for your interest.
 
peace,

Well, yes, individually, the terms "fuzzy" and "logic" may have the
implications you suggest, but put them together and you've got a whole
different animal.  It's kind of an oxymoron, the "fuzzy" part undermining
and qualifying the "logic" part by introducing intuitive leaps and such
("fuzzy" logic is used to compensate for unquantifiable variables that spoil
the predictions of "hard" logic).  It thus doesn't so much imply a lack of
precision (and anyway, I think there's a difference between an implication
and a full-blown critique) as point up what the drive for precision may
leave out.
 
I don't know if that makes it any more appealing to you, but it's another
way of looking at it, anyway.

I'm not certain about that quote, although Zukofsky did say that in poetry,
emotion is a matter of cadence. I don't have at hand the exact phrasing.

Hmm...not what I would've expected from the US military (no offense to any
US vets on the list), but certainly the potential to learn the
self-discipline which is also needed in zen can be found there.  Interesting
point!

Thanks for the advance preview of the King C show, Maria--I'm going to see
them Monday in S.F.  But I think it's adrian belew who does most of the
singing, at least in K.C.  (tho I haven't heard much of the new
material--maybe fripp does finally take over some of the vocals!)
 
I myself favor British psychedelia over American--it seems to want to
*create* a psychedelic experience through the popsong format, whereas the
Dead, Airplane, etc. seem to assume that the listener is already in the
psychedelicized space and just want to be the aural wallpaper in the trip
room.  Which is not necessarily to knock such bands, I just think the UK
version is more psychedelic as music, in and of itself.  But I'm 28 and
wasn't there for either kind when it was emerging, so whatta I know?  Anyway.

It's a poetry reading (or any kind of performance) where the performers
aren't announced ahead of time--anyone can just go and sign up and perform.
They're marked by loads of fresh energy and rawness of presentation--and by
really trite crap (sometimes simultaneously).  Come to S.F. and you can go
to two or three a night, every night.  All you can stand.

I think a lot of modernist artists have elements that can't be contained in
that box and have to be dealt with as pomo--Cocteau, as Stephen Barker has
argued, Stein and Woolf, Hart Crane, with his "hurricane poetics" and his
subversively strategized homoeroticism...but you're right, we could all be
here forever (or at least indefinitely suspended in the continuing present)
talking about postmodernism.

Fuzzy logic sounds to me like 'warm and fuzzy'; comfort in negative
capability or some such thing.
I like to think of the poet as actingt out of entrapment, the king
in Calvino's "A King Listens". The poet makes stories and counter
stories to accompany the echoes around and plotting. A word or
phrase echoes throughout the castle of the poem, suggesting
shapes and distances, a narrative of corridors in which plots
or unplots are made. A Poetics is to exercise power, like a king,
when no power is evident or  able. As O'Hara says, you go on your
nerve, and Calvino's king is nervous.
 
Then again, as A. Bergman says, I'm in  a fresh hell right now and
perhaps a little fuzzy for wear.

answer to Maria's question about hapax:
 
hapax legomenon = greek for 'used only once' 'single occurrence'. If a
word is found only once, how can you be sure what it means. I gave Apollo
a xxcjxc = a can of baked beans? a purple Chevy? a daffodil dipped in nutmeg?
a broken vibrator? a three-legged goat?
 
Interesting poetics questions that reverberate through much of the
discussion here. A lot of the assertion of faith in singularity,
marginality is tending toward hapax-ville. But that makes political,
communal collective political force rest on singular ironies. This is a
paradox that may be 'productive' on the local level (screens, pages full
of words), but beyond that (distribution, impact, others, public)
possibly not.

Kenneth,
 
Well, it's too bad there was such a dearth of response after
the first. I thought it was a cool idea and had hoped to see
more. Even though I don't get to read probabaly MOST of the
mail that this list generates, it remains my **first source of
info about books I think I MIGHT want to read**. There aren't
many places you can go for that sort of thing.

john and all--
 
let's fire it up again! for those of you who missed it the first time:  my
favorite part of vanity fair is when they ask famous people what they are
reading before they go to bed at night. instead, wouldn't it be great to
hear what people were reading whose minds & ideas we could actually
respect? i'm happy to compile a monthly list of recommended/bedside reading
lists for all on this list.

I find the books I'm reading broken into 3 distinct PLACES.  The

books located on my desk at home.  The third is books located at
work (as opposed to work-related). The latter books are either in
transition to home or are books I read during lunch breaks.
 
I'm at work now and these are the books on my shelf:
 
ZEN BUDDHISM AND PSYCHOANALYSIS (Fromm, Suzuki...)
ZEN FLESH, ZEN BONES

TOO HOT TO HANDLE (Juvenile baseball novel for my son Max)
THE BEAST 2 (Juvenile horror for my son Max)
HAND SHADOWS (TO BE THROWN UPON THE WALL) a republication of an
1859 book of hand shadows (for my brother John in prison--I
photocopied the various drawings of hand shadows and sent them to
him)
HOW TO PITCH (Bob Feller)
MODISMOS (Familiar English-Spanish expressions) (by Mrs. Anness.

Well, I've got a few books of interest I've been looking at lately--hope
nobody minds if I chime in here...
 
 
 1.  Raising Holy Hell (Bruce Olds) A fictionalized life ofJohn Brown,
due out in September. Amazing book--very powerful, though it bogs down in
the last fifty or so pages, after Lee and JEB Stuart crash Brown's party
at Harpers Ferry. This is by far the best review copy to cross my desk
this year...
 
2.  Manuscript Found in Saragossa (Jan Potocki) This was mentioned in
Perec's bk (A Void) & just came out in an English translation.
Hallucinatory & dense--imagine a new Decameron co-written by Goya &
Hoffman, wardrobe by Edith Head, sets by Lautremont...
 
3.  Exact Change Yearbook, At Passages, From the Other Side
of the Century: all part of my vacation Michael Palmer festival.  Very
interesting to hear Palmer read his new Poems.  I'd not imagined his voice
sounding like it does; the surprise I felt was akin to the first time I
heard Creeley or Williams read--how hearing the poets voicing radically
changes the way one reads the written work--the way theauthors diction &
intonation get somehow ingrained in yourhead & you find yourself
internalizing their vocalization. A bit disturbing, that--almost as if the
very act of listening to a recording imposes some kind of individualized
canonic reading, underming whatever tactical method of poetic speech
you've brought to the written text...
 
4.  Passing Duration, Four Lectures:  I've always gotten the sensethat
Rodefer's work is somehow out there pacing the Langpo boundaries (maybe
event horizon is a better term...).  Ghosts of events in those sentences,
gesturing toward some alien narrative in hopes of arriving at
atmosphere--The same thing I feel reading Coolidge sometimes.  Is there
anything available since Passing Duration that I might have missed?
 
Also, quick question to the G1 folks: does anyone remember a poetry
festival at a place called Thomas Jefferson College (now GrandValley
State University) near Grand Rapids, MI in the spring of 74? Oppen,
Reznikoff, Ed Dorn, Rothenberg(I think he was there..) were all in attendance
& the readings & roundtables were all either filmed or recorded on audio.
The rumor here is that there are still copies floating around, but no
one at the University has the slightest idea where one might get a copy...
If anyone attended or remembers seeing or hearing footage from this event,
please backchannel me...
 
                 yrs,

Subject:      Bedside reading
 
This is Kevin Killian.  I'm glad to see this feature return, as I too read
Vanity Fair regularly tho' the book list is not my favorite.  The true
crime articles are.
 
Here is what I've just picked up from around my bed:
 
"Vel" by Peter Inman-fantastic.  Four stars to you, P. Inman.  We printed
one of these poems in"Mirage #4/Period[ical]" but now I see, it was not the
best one after all, there are many, many just as good or better!
 
"Castle King Four," by Jim Reagan, who sent me this book, haven't read it
yet, don't know why he sent it.  He said it was a peace offering.  I don't
know who he is!  Seems to be a novel that pits Nazis against the OSS.
 
"Sliver," by Ira Levin.  I read it about every six months.  Dodie wrote a
paper about it once, for Todd Baron and Carolyn Kemp's zine "REMAP," on
"narration."  "A zillion times better than the movie," she says.  When is
the Ira Levin Conference happening?
 
Claude Royet-Journoud, "A Descriptive Method," tr. Keith Waldrop-it's
small, I should have finished this last week.  Didn't.  Just found it.
 
"Berlin Diptychon" by John Yau & Bill Barrette.  I'm copying one of the
poems here, "The Night Beast is Best," for my new poem, which will have a
better title.  This book is very luxe, glossy, heavy ink smell, has Berlin
written all over me.
 
"Tender Agencies," by Dennis Denisoff.  Why this book isn't a best seller
I'll never know.  Dennis D. is so smart & so accessible.  He is a former
member of the Kootenay School and from what I understand will be working at
Princeton this fall.  Yay Dennis.
 
"Abusing the Telephone," by Dennis Barone.  We had Dennis B. read at Small
Press Traffic where he read some of this.  We were screaming, kind of.  I
mean it was sedate in a way.  This is a very fiction collective kind of
book, tho published by Drogue.  Dennis, any one of these tales could have
been a novel, I say, expand, don't contract, be expansive like Whitman.
 
2 new books by Alice Notley.  Haven't opened it yet.
 
Thom Gunn, "The Man with Night Sweats."  Thom Gunn is a local hero & a
swell guy.  This book is his best one yet.
 
"Arshile #4" ed. Mark Salerno.  Arshile #4 features an interview with
Gilbert Sorrentino.  I always wondered why I had never met GS since he
works at Stanford and I'm in San Francisco.  Now I find that "the Bay Area
is so utterly antithetical to me that I find myself, at all times,
struggling against its cuteness, its apathy, its general air of paralysis,
its relentless small-townishness, so that it's hard to imagine being
'mellowed out' in the throes of battle.  I don't quite know what it is
about the place, but the entire Bay Area, with the source of infection
being, of course, that citadel of provincialism, San Francisco, has the air
of an amateur stage production set in sinister natural surroundings."  What
a jerk.  How about that "source of infection" metaphor Mr. Sorrentino?  Are
we afraid of the AIDS virus at Stanford University?  Anyhow Arshile #4 has
this wonderful piece in it by Yoko Ono and as usual a marvelous cover, this
time by Jasper Johns.
 
Bruce Andrews, "Ex Why Zee," collected, I don't know, work for the
"theater"?  Black and white drawing on the front, "pathetic masculinity" as
the art forum says.  "Abject art" my favorite.  All these little men
running around doing disgusting things, . . .  four stars for the cover
alone, belongs in the Whitney.
 
"Apex of the M" #3.  Read it from cover to cover searching for the
explanation from the editors, why on earth they went ahead last time and
printed that work by King Homophobe Ed Dorn!  No explanation, still.  One
editor told me that if they explained every editorial policy they made it
would be too long a magazine.  Fine.  Just wanted to put in my 2 cents on
this subject. Again.
 
"Everything as Expected," by James Herndon.  This book, from the 70's, is
the essential insider's guide to the collaboration between Jack Spicer &
Fran Herndon.  Color plates.  Seven of these collages were shown at recent
Blaser conference.  Five stars.
 
"Tony & Susan," by Austin Wright.  I think I got this mixed up with "Austin
and Mabel" but instead of being about the relatives of Emily Dickinson it
is some kind of literary horror novel.  Check it out.  I'm up to Chapter
Five.
 
"Esther: Her Murder Haunts a Small Town in Oklahoma."  True crime book.
Esther is a schoolteacher, in her seventies I think, I think she was
murdered in her sleep by some former students, but she's just gone to bed
just now at the place I've put it down.
 
"Written in Blood," by Caroline Graham.  She is my new favorite detective
writer.  Okay, so the ends of her books are always stupid.
 
"Empire of Words: the Reign of the OED," by John Willensky.  This guy
teaches at UBC and this book studies the use of citation in the different
editions of the OED to come to some conclusions about cultural studies.
Work it, girl.
 
Finally I've come to the floor.  Okay and one last book I've just finished
from the library, "The Juror," by George Dawes Green.  had to get this one
since it's the basis of the upcoming Demi Moore picture.  The back jacket
says that Dawes Green is a poet and the author of "the acclaimed novel "The
Caveman's Valentine" and he looks about 12.  Excellent!  George Dawes Green
are you on this poetics list?  Come on down!
 
Thank you Kenneth Goldsmith for arranging this group.

I love these lists also. Although Kevin's has made mine feel
inadequate. My excuse is moving. I've been trying to refile
but I've also pulled out all these old books that I found
while trying to alphabetize:
 
Mary Butts Imaginary Letters; Crystal Cabinet; Traverner Novels;
(by the way, any Butts fans out there, would love some info
back channel about any good criticism, I haven't found much
at all good or bad, and info about the Crowley-Butts connection
and her opium addiction (?).
 
Don DeLillo, Libra
 
Keri Hulme, Bone People (which has been abandoned as unreadable)
 
Ben Friedlander (there is an image of a knot for the title) (this
is available from Meow Press); recommended
 
Rachel Tzvia Back, Litany (also Meow Press and recommended)
 
Prosodia / 5 (nice mix of writers, mainly west coast; put
out by the students of the New College of California Poetics Prog)
 
Bloo (good pieces by Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian and Pat Reed)
 
Lesli Scalapino, Defoe (I love this book and have become obsessed
with it in the same way that I became obsessed with Fanny Howe's
Saving History last year)
 
a large stack of fashion magazines where I have actually
been spending most of my reading time
 
I would like it if people on this list would just post a
brief message about something good they have read whenever
they read it and how to get it. I mean both stuff that is
available at any Barnes and Noble and stuff that comes in
the mailbox. In more cases than not that usually motivates
me to obtain said item and in more cases than not I am glad
that I did.

Hi all--here's what's threatening to fall on me and crush me in my sleep:
 
_How Things Work: Science For Young Americans_,  a 1941 textbook with some
truly freaky illustrations.
 
_Earth and Sky Every Child Should Know_, similar, except w/a 1910 copyright.
 
Mark Twain, _The Innocents Abroad_.
 
Thich Nhat Hahn, _The Blooming of a Lotus_, a wonderful book of simple
meditations.
 
Levi-Strauss, _The Savage Mind_.  Learned a new word ("moiety") from this
one.  Means "half."  Not a hapax--he uses it twice.
 
A stack of submissions to Antenym, the magazine I edit (#7 due out in
August, featuring [at least] George Albon, John Olson, Colleen Lookingbill,
Darlene Tate, J.R. Willems, John Taggart, Charles Borkhuis, Michael
Basinski, Brian Boury, Andrew Joron, Michael Price, Kristin Burkart, Sheila
E. Murphy, Carol Ciavonne, Larry Eigner, Mike Kettner, I.E. Skin, Jean Day,
and Bob Heman).  Now if I can only figure out in what order to present them!
 
_Six By Seuss_.  Of course.
 
And soon--
Buckminster Fuller, _I Seem To Be A Verb_.  Soon as I can get my hands on a
copy.
 
Sweet dreams!

  Okay--I'll chime in---
   I'm reading these unpublished manuscripts---
    I am extremely knocked out by Ben Friedlander's reading of Frank
    O'Hara AND YOU BIG NAME PUBLISHERS OUT THERE ARE FOOLS NOT TO
    JUMP ON IT WHILE YOU CAN----
    This is the kind of "literary criticism" one does not see often--
    Then I'm reading THE FATE OF THE SELF (By Corngold--first time in
    paperback of a 1985 book---I'm reading this for possible "academic
    use" so i'm reluctant to mention it here, as is my reading in
    Shakespeare criticism--Susan Snyder, H.T. McCrary, etc. etc---
    ) Also got the EXACT CHANGE BOOK---The Stein piece (and Spahr's
    intro.) is great. Peter Gizzi's new manuscript has a great poem
    to Mark McMorris in it...and I got the new Garret lansing HEAVENLY
    TREE book...
    I'm sure I'm leaving things out...I read "Marriage" by Marianne
    Moore the other day---I often spend a whole night on one page!
    I read O'Hara's "To An Actor Who Died" because it's original title
    was "To Laura Riding" and "everybody" is telling me I should read
    Agamban very soon---
    It would be interesting if we could talk more about why we're reading
    (or what is happening why reading) than merely about WHAT--but perhaps
    that is not a function of the list....chris

Subject:      Re: Fuzzy Logic Poetics
 
I've always thought that a good portion of what made the avant-garde so
much more interesting than "traditional" poetics (tho I think that the
AG is a specific historic tradition in its own right, a historic
international "community" in all the senses of identity politics), is
that AG poets, by ignoring or breaking "trad" rules, take on the
responsibility for any/all elements in the work of art, rather than
simply having them "drag on as empty habit." In that sense, Kerouac,
say, is a totally rule driven poet (wild form is a Formalism, no?).
Whereas more trad poets seem to incorporate vast amounts of stuff into
their work without much reason for it being there, so that it tends to
sit like old lumpy oatmeal. There's been a discussion of metrics on the
CAP-L list for the past month full of anxiety over "correct"
interpretations, whether a spondee can be a spondee, whether variation
is just that or is a sign of incompetence, etc.
 
So when I hear of a reading such as Charles Alexander described or read
a text such as ShaunAnne's, it thrills me to realise that there are
people out there who take total responsibility for their rules.

In the 1960s, there was a wonderful Polish film mostly (but not
entirely, as I recall) in black & white of this same novel, with a
great hauting score by Penderecki. Very Borges'ian, a narrative within
a narrative within a narrative within.... It used to play at the
Central Cedar Cinema off Polk Street (right next to a fire house and
the only theatre I've ever been to that was actually in an alley,
almost impossible to find if you didn't know it was there) and was a
very cult thing. I must have seen it ten times, but it seems (like
virtually all European cinema) to have disappeared from American
screens. Batman Forever was on 20% of all theater screens in the US
last week. Sigh.

Never heard Olson live (was in the same room with him only once in my
life and that, the Berkeley Poetry Fest of '65, before I knew who he
was), but my sense of the recordings I've heard and/or own is that he
tended to speed up his reading of any text from slow almost overblown
beginning to rapid end. Only a few texts actually follow that format on
the page (long lines to open, short to close).
 
Zukofsky (again from recordings) seems to have paused every SECOND
line.
 
And then there was the period around 1970 when Duncan paused three
beats between each line, marking them with his hand and for awhile even
counting them outloud (I remember a series of readings of all of
Passages done over 3 consecutive Fridays when he did that
throughout--totally distracting).

No Ron, you're not. Thought the same thing when I first laid eyes on
Artifice of Absorption. & I have always loved Bucky's description for
his kind of formatting: he called it "ventilated prose."
 
& yes, Bucky was in the navy, circa WWI, in 1918 for sure, until 1922
when he did "US Naval Reserve Activities."  BY 1923 water wasn't
enough so he took to the air, what he called "Early Flying Actvities."
There's a piece of his called _Early Influences_ in which he talks in
some detail about his experiences in the Navy.

Imagining an extremely precise and tidy Groucho Marx will help one recreate
Zukofsky's rhythms while reading his poetry.
 
Similarly, Margaret Dumont will give you a very close approximation of
Gertrude Stein.
 
(Steven Wright, of course, works for a lot of LangPo.)

       I "forget to mention" (or "censored") that I'm also reading a lot
       of student papers in this summer class i'm teaching. A "reading
       literature" course that is weighted towards poetry and the reading
       of "non-poetic" texts "poetically"--I organized the course loosely
       around the theme of "NOTHING" and have not used official anthologies
       so i could include Stevens ("Adagia"), Mayer (Sonnets and "the obfuscated

       Ferlinghetti, Dickinson, Shakespeare, Dudley Randall, Blake in one
       class (also Brecht and Rilke)---I've selfishly swept up my students
       in my summer reading--but I "commit" to the list and so it's no more

I guess I've lurked long enough, enjoying everyone's efforts. Time to
throw something out & hope for the best...
 
 
Klatch of Mandingos, consumptives gone
trolling the swamps for cast-off
 
injection dies sees this & counts
coup on that pious oracular
 
gang of tunneler kids I'll portray
with an oval of semtex affixed
 
to my head, an elegant toque for this
bayou of implicate photon decay,
 
this digitized couplet of glass
in the form of a surgical saw.
 
You see?  The cognitive mist is
only a symbol: fissile, hermetic, as lambent
 
a synod of gnats as you're ever to find
in a cloud chamber bowl, glad-handed
 
then shunted then groused like a cup
of strontium milk, like a methadone
 
dose in a tumbler of pus.
Now even the tutors agree:
 
a deistic fist up the ass of
the cynic Lovejoy ain't near
 
impasse enough to preserve this
corpse from ballastic decay,
 
from assuming the form of an aerial
putsch, cap-a-pied & entangled again
 
in that cloud-like helix
of vernacular birds exploding
 
through the cockpit door,
their hideous scything librettos
 
deployed like a slew
of God's own cochlear tongs.
 
You'd just as soon say what next
then to see this end (as it must)
 
in arthritic paroxysyms of guillotine
japes: Chop, Chop! The author must fall!
 
Or do (as he will) one last opium trick,
diving over the wall in a thrilling
 
escape, though covered with audience
mucus & blood to demonstrate his
 
nostalgic devotion to porn--
"its perrenial nature, its ironic gaze,
 
akin as it is
to cinema-verite..."

Subject:      Re: Fuzzy Logic Poetics
 
Burt Kimmelman's first question,
>is fuzzy logic imprecise[?],
has been pretty well answered: it's precise but dangerously
arbitrary, guessing at quantifications in order to calculate
unknown probabilities.  Science needs this tool
because it can't do what art can: handle many concerns
at once.
 
Burt further asks
>is logic teleological by nature?
(perhaps asked rhetorically) since Loss's complaint assumes
that "logic" necessarily means goal-directed reasoning.
Such is logic's usual application, but it consists merely
of ways to transform and manipulate statements
keeping strict track of their resultant
truth values.  You could do that all day and still get
nowhere.
 
In pursuit of a "Fuller" understanding, I'd like to add
that the Buckyism about "in" and "out" instead of "up" and "down"
forms part of a more complex observation:
 
   No scientist would suggest that any part of the Universe
   Is identifiable as "up"
   Nor any other locale as "down."
   Yet individual scientists themselves
   As yet reflex spontaneously
   In an "up" and "down," conditioned-reflex miasma.
   Their senses say reflexively,
   "I see the sun is going down,"
   Despite that scientists
   And almost everyone else have known theoretically
   For five hundered years that the Sun is not going down at dusk
   And rising at dawn.
   What is more important in this connection
   Is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously
   For that is the way in which
   They usually behave in critical moments,
   And it is often "common sense" to reflex
   In perversely ignorant ways
   That produce social disasters
   By denying knowledge
   And ignorantly yielding to common sense.
 
     --R. Buckminster Fuller, _Intuition_ (New York: Doubleday 1972), 103.
 
You have to clear your mind of *cant*, in other words--but you also
have to realize that you finally *can't*, and deal with that.
A commonplace?  Maybe.  But it bears repeating, since we continuously
forget.  That's one reason there's art.

Jim,
 
As the one who put out the remark about Bucky's use of up, down, in, out,
and, indeed, shake it all about, I just wanted to say: thanks for the
lovely quotation, illuminating what i was referring to; and sorry if
I presented an ignorant write-up of Bucky, because what you posted was

Thanks,

Subject:      Re: Bedside reading
 
Just thought I'd chip in, stirred by KK's wonderful list:
 
I don't tend to have books on the go, tend to skim them or read a few
pages very intently; recent books thus treated have been - the opening
page of Derrida's Signeponge, the autobiographical sections of Derrida's
Memoirs of the Blind, bits mostly from the Blue Book in Steve Benson's
_Blue Book_ book; Chaucer's The Parlement of Foules, because it looks
like Britain's ruling Conservative party is about to elect a new leader
and Prime Minister (Chaucer *pretends*, it seems to me, to have a limited
view of love as monogamous marriage but offers a fable that is more
complex and leaks yearning for a wider love, platonic and/or non-monogamous,
also a sense of government that all potential leaders should subdue
themselves to, although this, and this is the flaw in all the leaks,
doesn't escape positioning women as passive and men as active); have
also been reading through all Leave books' latest pamphlets, especially
Sianne Ngai's amazing My Novel, and Kevin Killian's Santa. Oh, I have been
dipping in and out of the memoirs of the physicist Richard Feynmann's
_Surely You're Joking Mr Feynmann?_, which are lucid, chatty words of
a extraordinary curious boy in love with practical science, about which
subject he would never dream of being as patronising as he is in his book
about his three wives; Feynmann is such a relief from the superstring and
chaos theory and Stephen Hawking books that so many of the musicians I
know seem to be reading, because it's about computation and physical
experiment, constructing equipment and making things, not thinking about
time or light. Feynmann is the most enjoyable science book I've read since
reading Bucky, or Hugh Kenner on Bucky, the next best thing. Also, spent
a long morning reading Leo Bersani's infuriating essay "Is the Rectum a
Grave?" in _AIDS, Cultural Analysis, Cultural Activism_ ed Douglas Crimp
(infuriating because I share some of the critiques and hate others,
especially his oh-so-Freudian attack on child abuse campaigners as being
anti-sex; read in "anti-rape" for "child abuse" and see how it reads).
Also, am in love with Richard A. Bernstein's essay in _Working Through
Derrida_, ed Gary B.Madison, in which Bernstein judiciously and warmly
anaylses *both* Derrida *and* Habermas fairly, trying to work on the
join of modernity and postmodernity in very lucid readable prose.
 
I do tend to have television serials on the go; am currently watching
all the Jon Pertwee _Dr Who_ series from 1970-74, the latest _Deep Space
Nine_ episodes, the lesser known British sci-fi shows, _Sapphire and
Steel_ and _The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_; also the loveable
cartoon character Jay Sherman on _The Critic_; my opinion about all
of them is we don't make shows like that any more, that passion and
high seriousness, complexity of characterisation, and taking the work
seriously.
 
That's my list,
 
Ira

i'm trying to recall the name of an icelandic poetic form where the first
half of the line makes an assertion and the second half echoes it in
different words. would this be a kind of fuzzy logic procedure, and
indeed one that calls back to itself and perhaps in essence such a poem
proceeds with no end in mind.
 
anyone have any "fuzzy logic" poems?
 
what is the difference betw chaos and complexity (and how does fuzziness work
into this relationship?

Dear PoPeople,
 
I'm new to this list, and I'm intrigued by the bedside reading idea.
Although I'd have to disagree with one previous writer (whose message I
unfortunately deleted) about lists from people we respect.  Information
about (or from) people I don't respect is as interesting, and revealing,
to me as any other.  (Revealing as much about me as anybody else).  That
said, respect me or no, here's some stuff I've been reading/thumbing
through:
 
1.  Rosemarie Waldrop, A KEY INTO THE LANGUAGE OF AMERICA, along with an
edition of Roger Williams book of same name (her major "source") I got out
of the local Divinity School library.
 
2.  Denis Devlin, COLLECTED POEMS
 
3.  R.C. Lewontin, BIOLOGY AS IDEOLOGY
 
4.  Humberto Maturana & Francesco Varela, THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE
 
5.  Magazines: NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS, T.V. GUIDE
 
6.  Palmer, AT PASSAGES
 
7.  Thomas Kinsella, FROM CENTRE CITY, BLOOD AND FAMILY, and AN DUANIARE:
POEMS OF THE DISPOSSESSED, 1600-1900, (the last translations from Irish).
 
8.  A history of a local research park I'm proofreading.
 
9.  Henri Lefebvre, THE PRODUCTION OF SPACE
 
somehow this list seems "tame"
 
Cheers,
David

I've been in Russia for 2 weeks and have missed everything! it

I cd have read the entire discussion of "opportunity" and "rules"
sure, but... Can someone summarize in abt 25 words what the issue
with rules is/was? Nothing is liker a rule than the (supposed)
absence thereof. Ditto opportunity. What did I miss?
 
Ron, thanks for mentioning the wonderful '60s Polish movie of

Cinema (how it sticks in my mind, anyway). What a great place!
What was the movie theatre on Powell just on the Chinatown

Re: marking the beat with one's hand, a Duncan affect to be sure:
I remember when I first arrived in SF (earlyisyh 70's) and started
going to poetry readings, and encountered this annoying
"sensitive bandmasterism" - I think it took me a year or more to
figure out that it identified a Duncan acolyte. An awful lot of
leaden music got underlined in that manner, and I'm gonna bet
that Bayareans (at least of similar or longer vintage than mine)
will be able to reel off who these, then, youngish poets were/are.

>
> BACKGROUND
>
> R. Buckminster Fuller, Jr. was born in Milton,
> Massachusetts, on July 12, 1895.  He is best known for
> inventing the Geodesic dome, the most famous example of
> which was the United States Pavilion at the Montreal World's
> Fair, Expo '67.  Throughout his lifetime, Fuller introduced
> ground-breaking ideas in the fields of architecture, design,
> art, engineering, education, cartography and mathematics.
> Fuller called himself a "Comprehensive Anticipatory Design
> Scientist" -- and committed his life to finding the global
> strategies to make humankind "a success in the universe."
>
> Fuller believed that human evolution could best be promoted
> by reforming the living environment through design on all
> levels rather than by reforming people through economics
> and/or politics.  His Design Science also addressed energy
> harvesting, transporting and food gathering, all informed by
> his concept of dymaxion = dynamic + maximum + tension.
> (i.e. ever-increasing performance using ever less investment
> of materials.)
>
> By 1983, at the end of his eighty-seven years, Fuller had
> written more than twenty books, held twenty-seven patents
> for his inventions and had received forty-seven honorary
> doctorate degrees and numerous awards, including the United
> States Medal of Freedom and the American Institute of
> Architects' prestigious Gold Medal Award.
>
> Participants will discover, experience and participate in:
>
> * World Game -- Play on the world's largest and most
> accurate map -- the Dymaxion Map scaled to 70' by 35'.
> Stride a gymnasium-size map with fellow global citizens,
> developing strategies and working together to solve the
> world's problems.
>
> * Film Festival -- Attend screenings of Buckminster Fuller
> films -- hear Bucky speak and relive his life's work so you
> can use his teachings in your own life
>
> * "Bucky for Kids" Children's Festival -- Build Tensegrity
> Structures (nature's own building blocks) and Dymaxion Domes
> -- Learn the basics of "Synergetics" and Buckyballs.
> Introduce tomorrow's leaders to the ideas that are shaping
> their future.
>
> * Bookstore -- View Bucky's artifacts, exhibits and books --
> the gifts Bucky left for all of us.
>
> * Benefit Concert -- Musical greats who share Bucky's vision
> for the world.
>
> * Expert seminars and panels -- Hear personal stories and
> lifelong lessons from people who carry on Bucky's work
> today.
>
> This event will engage you in the question that Bucky lived
> by:  "If the success or failure of this planet, and of human
> beings
>  depended on how I am and what I do;
>                          How would I be?  What would I do?"

That was the Times Theatre. Every doubleheader cost 99 cents and I
spent a fortune at that place. When it was replaced by a Chinese
produce market, I was amazed to see how small it was. (I used to see
Francis Ford Coppola there back in the early 70s, all by himself in
the back.)

Dear Tom Mandel ,  re" rules " etc I can on the instant recall no clear
conclusions, through normal forgetfulness, I hope.
 
To add to the confusion here is an after-note, by means of some fairly well-cooked English translation of
 Andre (acute)
Felibien (acute on first e) secretary of the Academie (acute) Royale
de Peinture et Sculpture etc etc of Louis XIV in the Preface to the
Entretiens.
 
1. In practice he found out that "one meets a thousand
difficulties in the execution of a work, that cannot be overcome by
the learning imparted by all the precepts".  (1725, ed. p,.25, Garland
reprint)
 
2. "If there is a way of making the different parts of a painting
appear advantageously, giving to each its proper strength, beauty
and gracefulness, it is a means that does not consist in rules that
can be taught, but it is discovered by the light of reason, and in
this matter one must sometimes conduct oneself in opposition to the
rules." (ibid.p.26).
 
(He is talking about the composition of the whole, worked out in
advance of the "execution" of it...)
 
Thus the problem in the later 17th century formulation of a rationale
for instruction of aspiring painters in how to compose history paintings (and elsewhere for
composing epic).   It implies, I suppose, a function for the resulting
pictures: they are usually big, to be seen at a distance, and such that the moral shall be
clearly seen, quickly and easily in all and any of the details, not
least of which is an insistence on lucid rational structures of
representation. Moreover, within the early academy every picture
comes to be looked on as a staging of a coherent moment of time
as in a drama. (as I recall,  by the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury in
?1713)

        I, too, really like the "bedside reading" feature of the list.
Here are some that are, actually, closer to the couch:
 
        1)  VOLCANO, by Garrett Hongo, in which he recounts his search
for the Big Island childhood he never had.  An honest attempt, woefully
written (he puts Keats and Shelley in a cuisinart and pours the remains
over fields of lava).
 
        2)  THE WINGED SEED, Li-Young Lee.  A memoir/prose poem about
growing up in Indonesia and rural Pennsylvania, as the son of a Chinese
fundamentalist Christian father.  Interesting experiment, which most
often works, except when he addresses his beloved.
 
        3) TURNING JAPANESE, David Mura.  Yes, there's a theme here.
Memoir of an Asian-American poet from Minnesota who lived for a year in
Japan; interesting "identity" study.  I like his prose better than his
poetry, which sounds more like, well, prose.
 
        4) DICTEE, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha.  Memoir in experimental pieces,
which I haven't yet finished.  But there's a strong article on her by
Shelley Wong in _Feminist Measures_, edited by Lynn Keller and Cristane
Miller (Michigan)--good on the "problem" with Asian-American experimental
writing and identity politics.
 
        5) Lots and lots of Gertrude Stein.
 
        6) XENIA, by Arkadii Dragomoschenko.  Wonderful meditative passages.
 
        7) CANNIBAL, by Terese Svoboda.  OK, so she's a friend of mine.
I heard her read sections of this book about her travels in the Sudan at
our new Barnes and Noble; they put her in the cookbook section.
 
        8) Poems by Sudesh Mishra, a poet from Fiji who lives in
Australia.  Rather Walcottesque in its metaphorical density; his claim
is, however, that this work IS experimental in his context.
 
        I also confess to an over-fondness toward Nirvana's Unplugged cd,
though I'm perhaps too late for the rock lyric discussion of a while
back.  Great rendering of a Leadbelly song.
 
        Enough for now; keep the lists coming!

Only saw Olson read once, at Berkeley Poetry Conference July
12-23, 1965 (or so it says here on my "admission card," which
I've somehow managed to schlep through the decades). No memory
of him pausing after lines, although that wasn't a very
representative reading--was it? I was too young (17) to really
read all the social subtexts going on, just knew that the Don
Allen anthology was coming fabulously alive around me. I do
seem to recall an indignant Duncan storming out...
 
Also: happy Frank O'Hara's birthday (June 27)--he would have
been 69 today.

the most beautiful piece of "criticism" or commentary on this work is _Excerpts
from Dikte for Dict e_ by Walter K. Lew, available from SPD I think.  it's a
"critical collage," with intertexts, photos, movie stills, just gorgeous.
there's also a book called something like "writing nation, writing self," or
some such, put out as a companion volume to dictee by the third woman press,
edited by elaine kim and someone else.  it's a volume of critical essays on
dictee. but walter's book is breathtakingly beautiful, not a standard work of
"criticism" at all.

Subject:      Doom Patrols (Reading list)
 
As long as I'm giving out URLs, one of my summer reading books is not yet
in print and only available on-line, Steve Shaviro's "Doom Patrols."  It
can be found at <http://dhalgren.english.washington.edu/~steve/doom.html>.
 
 
Based on the chapters I've read so far, I highly recommend it to anyone on
poetics list.
 
It's not, and not about, poetry, but it's the first prose book I've read in
a while that's given me the same buzz as the all-over, personal inner-mind
sprawl of many recent longpoems.
 
"Doom Patrols" is an autobiographical work of literary theory; a rich blend
of gender theory, electronic culture, comic books & films, true
confessions, (very) revisionist post-structuralist thought, rock & roll,
self-exposition, new (&old) abjectionists) and more.  Chapter titles
include: David Cronenberg, Kathy Acker, Dean Martin, Daniel Paul Schreber,
Walt Disney, Cindy Sherman, et al.
 
Chris Stroffolino and others who were discussing criticism about pop music
forms a while back, might find Shaviro's chapter Bilinda Butcher, about the
band My Bloody Valentine, to be of interest.
 
I don't just read one thing at a time, but this post is already too long,
so I'll save the rest of my summer reading list for another time.
 
Bests,

I'm a sucker for bedside reading lists (and desert island lists, and
really all sorts of lists).
 
Leon Howard's biography of Herman Melville; way out of date, but
beautifully printed.
 
Richard Ellmann's Joyce biography.
 
Erwin Panofsky's Studies in Iconology.
 
Christopher Hill's Milton and the English Revolution.
 
Louis Untermeyer's unintentionally hilarious anthology of Robert Frost poems.
 
Gil Sorrentino's Aberation of Starlight.
 
Hugh Kenner's The Counterfeiters (again).
 
Various offprints from various friends and acquaintances.
 
The latest Talisman, and (of course) Ed Foster's book of poems.

For those who are interested in R Buckminster Fuller, I've run across
references to an e-mail mailing list, geodesic-list, that focuses on his
work.  I haven't subscribed so I don't know how active it is, but the FAQ,
drawn mostly from postings to geodesic-list, was interesting enough.
 
To subscribe send the message <subscribe geodesic your name> to

SUNY-Buffalo.
 
The address for the Bucky FAQ is

Considering this proposition, I surfed over to the NASA web page and came
up with the following:
 
        THE IMAGINATIVE PROCEDURES OF COSMOLOGISTS
 
        higher level conclusions surfaced
 
        NASA is defining and executing
        a new way of doing business
        not some vision on the distant horizon
        farming-out is a reality
 
        management/transition plan
 
        "farming-out process" critical
        management across the entire life cycle
        (through development operations utilization)
 
        total erosion of the NASA skill base
        to assure quality products
 
-- Complexity of the automation implementation and the stability of the
process to be automated must be weighed against the return on the investment
 
        there is a requirement for human/decision intervention
        the process is unstable
 
        the way-of-doing business
        make certain skill levels obsolete
        long-time "accepted decompositions"
 
        delivery of an unusable system (costly ops)
 
        Cow's [sic] can cause.
 
(word salad from the second NASA workshop on mission operations,
"Hunting Sacred Cows").
 
 
Obviously, cosmologists and poets have similar imaginations ;-).
Seriously, though, the question of "reasons for art," like most talk
about the aesthetic or other justifications/sacralizations for poetry,
makes my eyes glaze over.

Ira--
        Responding to Burt's clear-eyed questions about logic, I thought I saw
a chance to do my favorite net-thing, which is tie, weave, or otherwise braid
various conversational threads together.  In this case I did it clumsily
indeed, if I came off as saying "Look, here's something ignorant Ira missed."
What I'd rather hoped to say was something more like "Look, here's a way in
which Fuller's observation, recently, perceptively noticed by Sorry-I-forget
-whom (i.e. you), reinforces a poetically useful sense of what logic, smooth or
fuzzy, is and ain't."
        At the same time, I thought (reflexively?) that what Fuller says in that
passage--about "common sense" putting very frequent pitfalls in everyone's
path, no exception for me nor thee--bears a lot of repeating, but not because I
suppose it to be big news to you, informed and accomplished as you are.  More
like ballplayers keeping up the chatter on the baseball diamond, constantly
reminding one another of what they already know.  "Play's to third."  "He's a
whiffer."  It helps, no?

--sorry to worry this like a puppy w/ an old shoe, but--
as I take my PhD comps in August, my bedside reading is a little. . .
um--perverse?!--right now--and today as I was reading Derrida I found this:
"One goes from blindness to the supplement.  . . . Blindness to the
supplement is the law.  ANd especially blindness to its concept.
Moreover, in order to see its meaning, it is not enough to locate its
functioning.  The supplement has no sense and is given to no intuition.
We do not therefore make it emerge out of its strange penumbra.  We speak
its reserve."
 
So--writing is always already thinking in reverse?  Supplement (words)
have no meaning in and of themselves, only when we re-apply presence/self
to them do they/can they mean--but they are at first our escape from
presence/self--?
hmmm. . . I knid of like this--writing is always already thinking in
reverse. . .

_the presocratics_, by philip wheelwright. a general text chosen fr its
contextualizing approach. interested in pursuing pythagoreanism and
cont. art. might have some value
 
_on christian doctrine_, st. augustine
 
-revelations of divine love_, julian of norwich
 
-the temple-, george herbert: interesting -- i found a copy of _the
temple_ in the UBC bkstore a few days before the blaser conference. colin
browne presented a paper on herbert there which was incredible! timing is
everything
 
everything and anything by bpNichol. re reading bk 1 for the
3rd or 4th time. the first few pages always astound me! everything he
does in the other bks is set down there: "premonition of a future time or
line we will be writing" ... "a future music moves now to be written" ...
 
_the surrealist parade_, by wayne andrews (i'm certain he's the author:
just picked it up at a used bkstore. it looks like it's written part
documentary/part journal, which is why i bought it. it also contains some
hugo ball quotes which i've never come across previously

        Not sure I could sort out a pedigree for this notion.  I get my sense
of what logic is first from reading Quine (who often takes issue with Carnap),
then from Peirce and Dewey.  Taken as a whole, it's a discipline relating
more directly to statements than to states of affairs.  Sorry, whosever eyes
glaze on this stuff . . .  Logic is one of the ways people deal with questions
in the spirit of "If it's safe to say P, then what else is safe to say?"  Logic
goes at this by way of analyzing grammatical transformations.  As to what is
safe to say in the first place, we look elsewhere than to logic for that (with
an important exception: logic looks for instances where P is safe to say merely
because all sentences with the same grammatical form P are safe to say, like
"I only drink when I'm alone or else with somebody," which must be true, or
safe to say, but only trivially).
        In this sense, logic is a game (or maybe a playing field) where one of
the ground rules is "say one thing at a time."  This ties it in with what I've
called science, a method applying logical procedures to investigate nature.
It usually goes unstated, but science is largely built upon this one-thing-at-a
-time rule.  No rules = sorry, game called on account of obscurity.  Science
wants one statement, one related set of variables, one question at a time.  Too
many uncertainties in play = unsafe playing conditions, confusion, nonscience.
        But as we know, the world doesn't have to play by these rules.  Often
people come upon knots, clouds of multiple, indivisible considerations.  There
are more things, etc., Horatio.  People will not limit their wondering to
well-formed, stand-alone, single-vision questions.  To think knotty, cloudy
considerations through, we resort to art.  (This is not a commutative
proposition, tho: I do not say "the thinking-through of gnarly questions = a
good-enough definition of art."  Art is a means well suited to this need, is
all.)
        Fuzzy logic, and fuzzy set-theory from which it derives, announces
itself as a rapprochement between science and the way most people actually
think.  It arises from the attempt to get computers to behave intelligently--a
goal that has not, say the least, been met.  I don't believe it is the best
way to effect that rapprochement.  For one, they haven't come up with an
agreeable axiom for fuzzy implication.  More importantly, it works by
instantiating dummy values in place of uncertainties.  I see now that I really
agree withLoss Glazier on this: fuzzy logic, if not logic at large, is in a
strong sense antithetical to poetics, which works *with* uncertainties.  Our
Unclear Heritage, so to speak.
 
        Do physicists have a different imagination from poets?  In this view,
not at all; but they do adhere to very different procedures, develop different
reflexes, get stuck in different ruts, harbor different expectations, etc.,
etc.  Do footballers have a different imagination from chessplayers?  Who would
know?  Maybe, but . . .

Subject:      Re: Fuzzy Logic Poetics
 
Dear Jim,  interesting commentary on Logic.  Turning to
 poems, paintings etc etc, THE ARTS, one finds enigma,
paradox, ciphers that remain always resistant to final decipherment,
although logic be applied to answering the questions they ask.  I don't
think of arts as illogical, or subject to vagueness, so much as inviting
speculations and dreams with almost no limitation.
 
I note that in this view, artworks are not consumable, because they are
 inexhaustible. It is not the case, we know, that a painting once seen by
 one person disappears from sight for evermore.  We all know, too, that
the answers proposed by one person to the questions it asks does not
 exhaust its possibilities. Artworks appear to lure one into
understanding them, which can be a long and arduous process of
discoveries about, for instance, society,  self and about the
mysterious workings of media. Recuperation and cooptation and
consumerisation cannot entirely submerge these possibilities, even
thouh they may reduce the social impact of radical novelty.

This is an excellent point that's escaped me until now.  It's almost a
reaction to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, giving the barest nod to all
that escapes reduction to logical principles and then proceding to reduce
them anyway, the admission that this reduction is only provisional lost
under the extension of logic's dominion.
 
This sounds like an anti-logic, anti-science post, but it's not.

Next to my bed-cum-magic carpet are nothing but travel books--the

Bruce Chatwin, "The Songlines", "What Am I Doing Here"
Paul Theroux, "Paddling the Pacific"
Paul William Roberts, "A River in the Desert", "Empire of the Soul".

Jim,
 
Poetry's first functions were to remember things and to explain things (or
is the latter mythology cum science?).  So today since mallarme, perhaps,
poetry is language per se (is this a writing supplement Shaunanne?). And
today cosmologists explain in languages that appeal to us (we can't go for
the old personification game any longer).  As for history, I think of
Carnap again and what I take to be his eloquent and ultimately futile
insistence on quantification of phenomena (pace, Husserl et al.). But
what IS history writing (a supplement).
 
If I'm not making sense then forgive me my confused and I guess confusing
ramblings.

burt: "twentieth-century aesthetics and technology"? first off, my sympathies, but as you must do it, try kenner, also all that baloney about typewriters and the modern poem. scratch technology deeply and you're in the 18th cent.; all reactionaries.

The latest pile of not-read-yets (purchased at my local Waldenbooks couple of
weeks ago) includes:
DISTANT RELATIONS (Carlos Fuentes)
THE ALIENIST (Caleb Carr)
ASPHODEL (H.D.)
TRINITY FIELDS (Bradford Morrow)
THE PUSHCART PRIZE '94/'95 (I actually ordered this; glad to see a story from
Lucia Berlin's Black Sparrow book, SO LONG, in there; more people should know
her work.)
CHAIN/2 (Juliana Spahr was nice enough to send a copy; haven't had time to
read much yet, but was entirely knocked out by Janet Zweig's HER RECURSIVE
APOLOGY, an exercise in extremist excellence.)
The list of have-reads includes:
ALL ACTS ARE SIMPLY ACTS by Ed Foster (Lovely, thanks, Ed. By the way, is the
new TALISMAN out? Any chance I could get a copy??)
THE GEOGRAPHICS by Albert Mobilio
STROMATA by David Miller
BERLIN DIPTYCHON, poems by John Yau, photographs by Bill Barrette
I'm in the middle of Bradford Morrow's THE ALMANAC BRANCH (whew! weird! just
my style!).
Like another on this list (I'm afraid I've forgotten who), I recently
received a 1990 novel by one Jim Reagan (Castle King-Four) with that same
cryptic note; mine reads: ....this is a peace offering made to you in the
memory of (not knowing who the mentioned people are, I'll leave that out)...
Never heard of any of them before either. You have to admit, though, he got

For some reason, I find it very interesting to see what different people are

Kern's _The Culture of Time and Space_
Clarke's _Rendevouz with Rama_
John Bradley, ed. _The Atomic Ghost_ (GREAT poetry anth)
Rand's _The Fountainhead_ (yeah, I know. . . but. . . )
DeLillo's _Ratner's Star_
Foster's _New York by Gaslight and Other Urban Sketches_
 
This sounds like an interesting course--good luck!

        What a territory to cover!  I'm muy jealous.
 
Some things you might want to look at (a very incomplete list):
 
        Marshall Berman, _All That Is Solid Melts Into Air_
        Hugh Kenner, _The Mechanic Muse_
        Daniel Czitrom, _Media and the American Mind_
        McLuhan, _Understanding Media_ or one of the Fiore collaborations
        Cecilia Tichey, _Changing Gears_
        Heidegger, "The Q. Concerning T." (already suggested, here seconded
                                despite its big-time abstruseness)
        Benjamin, "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire"
        Sigfried Giedion, _Mechanization Takes Command_
        Peter Jukes, _A Shout in the Street_
        Jackson Lears, _No Place of Grace_

>what's the relationship btwn rhyme and reason? Serendipity and causality?
 
Like most thingks that seem to oppose one another, they spend a lot of time
becoming one another, blending and blurring boundaries between.  Rhyme makes
notions reasonable; reason gets broken down and sneaked into rhyme.
Causality is a kind of serendipity (you know, it's the kind of serendipity
that has a cause), which then lends itself to other branches of other causal
chains without ever being quite incorporated within them.

Yes, that's great. But why not also throw in Hitchhiker's Guide to the

Hazel Smith with austraLYSIS: Poet Without Language: Poems, Performance
Texts and Text-sound works (Compact Disc: Rufus Records).
 
 
 
"...complex verbal rhythms (are) a very exciting extension ..(of) the way
rap uses the syllable as a percussive unit" Gail Brennan Sydney Morning
Herald
 
"convincing proof of the arrival for good of the female poetic voice"Joy
Wallace Pages UK
 
"the impressive title-track...familiar reading styles and predictable voice
inflections are disrupted by multi-tracking...the voice becomes a truly
flexible instrument"John Jenkins Overland
 
Poet Without Language  is a CD of poetry, text-sound and performance works
by Hazel Smith. Three of the works,Poet Without Language, Caged John
Uncaged  and Silent Waves were  written in combination with musician Roger
Dean.They are performed by Smith with Roger Dean and Sandy Evans, members
of the contemporary music group  austraLYSIS.
 
In the poems experimentation with language is to the fore and Smith, who
now refers to her work as "feminist performance linguistics", demonstrates
her central concern with forging a new language, one relevant to her
particular position as a woman, musician and poet.
 
The performance texts and text-sound pieces take this quest for a new
language further through an exploration of the interface between language
and music. This involves the application of musical techniques, such as
rhythmic notation, to language, and the use of technologies such as
sampling and multi-trackling, so that  language is dislocated and
re-synthesised into complex semantic and sound structures.
 
 
Hazel Smith lived in England until she moved to Australia in 1989. Her
volume Threely was published by the Spectacular Diseases Imprint in England
1986, and her volume Abstractly Represented: Poems and Performance Texts
1982-90  was published by Butterfly Books in 1991. Some of her work was
included in the 1991 anthology Floating Capital: New Poets From London,
Potes and Poets Press, U.S.A. A 1994 issue of the U.K. poetry journal Pages
is devoted to her work.
 
Hazel has given performances in many countries including Australia, Great
Britain, USA, Belgium and New Zealand, and also on the ABC, BBC and US
radio. Her collaborations with Roger Dean, have been broadcast extensively,
and their piece Poet without Language  was nominated by the ABC for the
Prix Italia in 1993.
 
Hazel is a lecturer in the School of English at the University of New South
Wales. She is also an internationally active violinist and leader of the
contemporary music group austraLYSIS.

I suppose, when I asked this, these were the issues I was thinking
about.
It seems that rhyme and reason, in my mind, demonstrate and acot
out of the paradox you find in "cleave".  Causality and serendipity,
as Steve nicely states it, do tend to bleed into and out of
one another, which raises in my mind difficult narrative issues.
I think it was Hume who argued along these lines, positing that
the eight ball sinks by virtue of perfect coincidence, autonomous.
Any hand is as likely as a royal flush.  I'm not sure hou to handle
this in the narrative I want to spin, but it seems, at one angle,
that all of these matters result from desire; a desire for pattern
which mean by both predictability (Zola or James) and, on the
other side, astonishing improbability (aleatoric or OUlipean).

   marisa---i just read your note (there are 44 others for me--ugh--and
   non of them are by you) and thank you for being sympathetic again--
   (none of them--not non--belated typo recognition--aren't they all?)
   and it was good talking earlier and then I sat down with O'Hara
   (and Lansing--who I'm suppossed to review for Foster--is sooooo stiff
    by comparison--but then so am i too much)---"sat down with O'hara"--
   what a weird phrase---anyway he wrote--
      "You enable me, by your least remark,
       to unclutter myself, and my neerves thank you for not always laughing"
    Which made me think of a feeling towards you (nerves)--
     A feeling towards something between us that is neither you nor I
     And that doesn't at all seem accurate but vague and the urge to
     "express the unexpressable" is not perhaps the quickness that makes
      one want to blow the lid off self-consciousness (so-called
      "spontaneous" torrents recollected tranquilly) and ask you
      if you're still looking for "questions for kenneth" (a quiz-show)--
      did you (or jordan) ask him whether he thinks he might have had
  a   any influence on O'Hara's work--and if so, where? Many people seem
      to make their relationship into a one way street--but that can't
      be true, can it?
      ----I hope you read this before you go (so you can have it in your
      head to keep you company on the plane....) Love, chris

My two cents (heavily restricted of late due to moving--I still have
20+ cartons of books, mostly fiction & poetry, boxed in the attic
waiting for the arrival of $1000 in bookcases I bought on Monday):
 
Snow Crash by Neil Stephanson (very good, but not as good as the blurbs
on the jacket make out)
Heat, by Stuart Woods (his worst--I may never read another...)
Pronto, by Elmore Leonard (he's become very gentle and humorous since
he stopped drinking)
Sessions, by Eli Goldblatt (Chax Press! Some wonderful pieces here that
reminds me a lot of my own impulses in the poem "Hidden"--I haven't met
Eli yet, but since we now live in the same area, I'm looking forward to
it)
Culture on the Brink: Ideologies of Technology, edited by Gretchen
Bender & Timothy Drucker (lots of "celebrity" critics--Aronowitz,
Laurie Anderson, Andrew Ross, Paula Treichler, Kathleen Woodward,
Langdon Winner--mostly showing how little knowledge of technology they
really have)
CIO magazine
Service News
Information Week--the best technology mag around
PC Week

I totally agree w/ Walter Benjamin and w/ Marshall Berman.
 
I would also include Society of the Spectacle by Guy DeBord, Writing
Degree Zero by Roland Barthes, What is Literature? by Sartre, recent
writing (about PCs and poetry) by Charles Bernstein, Mayakovsky's How
are Verses Made, Williams Spring & All, Perelman's The Trouble with
Genius, Fred Jameson on Late Capital
 
As for Blade Runner (a great movie I've seen 5 or 6 times), I'd use it
only if/as I used Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K.
Dick. (Also Dr. Bloodmoney, The Man in the High Castle). Good point for
talking about essentialism in forms...
 
Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon, Dhalgren by SR Delaney, Geek Love, work

You might for argument's sake teach some letterpress books from Toothpaste or
Burning Deck or Tuumba, or even something mimeoed, as a way to talk about
slippage, or restricted access, or receding possibilities. "A Funny Place" by
I think Richard Snow about the history of Coney Island from Adventures in
Poetry might be suitably perverse about this (and the "period" quality all
technological advances keep latent until they're renovated--viz letterpress,
mimeo, super-8, pixelvision).

To Everyone Who Has Sent Me A List For My Tech/Aesth Course:
 
Thank you so very much for your time, energy and most of all information
(data?).
 
The two winners far and away were Heidegger and Benjamin--both of whom
I feel have been built upon eloquently by more recent others but still
worth the read--though H's two essays, "Building Dwelling Thinking" and
"The Thing" are better as far as understanding tech from the philsoophical
p of v.
 
I guess that I should--what the heck (gotta practice communicating over
the transom in child-talk--thank you, mr. exon)--send my rather antiquated
syllabus and will do so soon as I get a moment to upload.
 
Ryan:
 
Have you seen Alan Bullock's essay (in an anthology about Modernism) on
the effect of photography on everything, ina way how it engendered Modernism?
 
Lastly, yes I know wht I just said about Heidegger's "Question" but I can't
resist sharing with you this brief passage from the essay:
 
"Technology . . . is no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing.
If we give heed to this, then another whole realm for the essence of
technology will open itself up to us. It is the realm of revealing,
i.e., of truth."

I'm still new to this list, still feeling my way.  I didn't catch the
original post on this subject, but Tony Green's intervention touched a
few issues dear to me heart.

True enough, but it seems to me that the same thing could be said about
most meaningful events, given a context in which one is willing to call
that event "art."  To put it another way, the cultural framing of an event
as artistic encourages the viewer/reader/consumer *not* to throw it away
-- such frames say, *watch out, you haven't exhausted this yet* -- whereas
other cultural and institutional frames do not.  So that the question of
its exhaustibility is not inherent in anything having to do with the work
as such.
 
I'm sorry, I know the frame is an inadequate and overused metaphor.  But
you get the drift.  (Tony Bennett (the critic, not the crooner) makes a
related point in *Outside Literature*, only to say there ain't no
outside).  My aim is not to say that you *can* exhaust art, but rather to
say that inexhaustibility is not *special* to art, even if it might be
special (for historical reasons) to aesthetic contextualization.
 
Cheers,
David

Hi all. Well, seeing that another young lurker has come out of the shadows
emboldens me to also appear. Besides, what better way to join a poetics
list than to list what you read? Anyway, here goes:
 
Defoe, Leslie Scalapino
At Passages, Michael Palmer
Leviathan, Paul Auster
Resisting the Virtual Life (anth)
about to begin the Decameron
 
Also the discussion of fuzzy logic and/or poetics has been interesting; I'm
just getting back into some work I did a couple of years ago, in college,
about poetry as a nervous system, taking most of my source material from
recent research into neural networks & optics & holography. I think it is
spotty poetically, & the net.utopia undercurrent, which I was fairly
unaware/uncritical of then, makes me blush now, but I'm still interested in
the way scientists are forced to make use of metaphor to do their work.
Then I like stealing the metaphors, phrases etc. & making poems out of
them.
i.e.,
"The hornlike structures are the last silhouette, the well-known shape of
niches in the structure  and operation of the nervous system. Human density
contains specialized internal packing, and thus maximum surfaces, and thus,
while other regions appar to have permeation channels, much of the water
may be bound in a gel-like matrix..."
 
One thing I find interesting about contemporary science, related to poetics
& art practice in general, is its recent (relative to the arts) discovery
of the "process" as an organizing principle.

Subject:      Malley Affair
 
Dear Everybody,
 
Juliana Spahr suggested that we drop a line immediately upon reading
something interesting.
 
_The Ern Malley Affair_ by Michael Heyward, Faber & Faber, (London, Boston)
284 pp., $12.95 US, $19.99 Canada
 
in paper and available through Barnes & Noble (they have several copies at
the Astor Place branch,) is notable for the clarity with which it deals with
the complexities of taste, literary identity, and experimental writing. The
book seems (from here) a subtle treatment of the literary scene in Australia
in the 40s, particularly of the self-regard of Max Harris and the stance of
his magazine, _Angry Penguins_, that so irritated James McAuley and Harold
Stewart, two poets in an OSS-sounding organization called the Directorate of
Research and Civil Affairs, that they manufactured, with the aid of a
collected Shakespeare, the Concise Oxford Dictionary, a Dictionary of
Quotations, and a US Army report on mosquito control, Ern Malley and his
poems. In an afternoon. Ahem. Anti-hegemony and Edgar Allen (sic!) Poe take
note:
 
 Malley was born in an idle moment that afternoon in the spring
 of 1943. After lunch McAuley and Stewart had the place to them-
 selves: there were no urgent telegrams to deal with, no research
 jobs to finish on the double. Here was their chance to do something
 they'd fantasized about, take _Angry Penguins_ down a peg or
 two. Another issue was just out--they thought it reached new
 heights of pretension. They set to work improvising Ern Malley,
 their Primitive Penguin, writing his poems out on an army-
 issue, ruled quarto pad, tearing each page off as they filled it.
 
Heyward is not _totally_ convinced of the merit of the poems, which are
collected in the book (as are Malley's Ernst-ish collages), but he does cite
defenders of the work including Judith Wright, John Tranter, John Ashbery and
Kenneth Koch. Some effects of the hoax were: to unbalance the equation of
value between a work of poetry and the name on it; to suggest, very early on,
the possibility that work generated by chance and mischief (and with
deliberate disregard for taste) can be taken for beautiful and meaningful;
and to turn public attention to poetry (albeit disastrously).
 
Anyway, just thought I'd mention it.
 
Love,
Jordan

Subject:      Re: Fuzzy Logic Poetics
 
Thinking of David Kellogg' comments on institutional framing
determining
 
that what it encloses determines how it is understood,
 
 
I wonder whether that framing isn't in fact based on such separations
and distinctions as appear to be fuzzed in the discussion of fuzzy logic
 in poetics as opposed to unfuzzy logics supposedly outside poetics.
If as I guess the things designated as artworks are mainly
interesting to look at, hear, whatever, because of their enigmatic
and inexhaustible possibilities, then I'd guess the institutional
formations are useful and effective, in that respect.
 
That doesn't mean I hope that the actual choices of what is and what
is not included as Art are already decided once and for all. On the
contrary, the canon can and does shift, and the canon is the site of continual
(art) politics. Arthur Danto's sense of something lost and gone
forever cannot hold up the process and maintain the limits of art.
 
Yes, if you were to isolate (frame) any "event" (i.e.tell the story of
it, photograph it, plan to have it occur, for instance,) -- there
could well be someone sho will regard it as really interesting them,
as enigma, paradox, etc etc, that is, use it as if it were an art
work and want to designate it as such (for inclusion in the canon).
 
But the warning note sounded from the direction of an institutional
theory about specifying what is and is not art, as I began to, with
respect to fuzzy logic, is something  that  has stopped me in my
tracks for a good half hour.

Hello poetics,
          Suppose it may have been noted, but Joe Ross has poems in _Avec_ &
_Impercipient_ from something called "The Fuzzy Logic Series"-- he's referred
to them as "Ashberyan" and they do seem so. Particularly compared to other of
his work.
           Re my own bed:
           I'm taken at the moment by _Touch Monkeys: Nonsense Strategies for
Reading Twentieth-Century Poetry_ by Marnie Parsons. U.Toronto Press
overpriced hardcover. Interesting reading of Stein/Zukofsky/Language through
Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, etc. using Kristeva to very good end. Though she
gets Cage wrong I think. But I would.
              Also the new Hobsbawm _Age of Extremes_ very excellent.
               Really wanted to like Deirdre Bair's _Anais Nin_  --more
interested in Bair than Nin, i.e. why did she choose to write about her
following Beckett & Beauvoir-- but it's fallen to the wayside.
               Also I have many copies of _Aerial 8: Barrett Watten_ beside
my bed which I certainly recommend. $12.95 to Aerial/Edge, POBox 25642, WDC
20007. I'll be posting soon a longer description of that as well as backlist
info.
            Lightning w/ logic: dogs bark at strangers. Not enough & too
much? or Maybe you had too much too fast. Can the Fuzzy be more than
metaphorical? as Chaos Theory was a hot metaphor in the arts a few years ago.
Not to dismiss description but I want to see it happen. I mean,  The
sun _is_ one foot wide. How?

Burt,
No, I haven't seen the essay you mentioned.  Where does it appear?
 
I found where the Holmes schtuff is; I read about it in an essay
by Stuart Ewen called "Goods and Surfaces".  He also wrote another
fine essay on media and aesthetics called "The Marriage Btwn Art
and Culture".  Both essays can be found in a book called _All
Consuming Images_, Basic Books, 1988.
 
I would appreciate the details on the Modernism piece, if you
have them.
 
Take care,
Ryan

Tony and David,
I'm really enjoying these posts on the subject of exhaustability
and its orbiting issues.
I suppose, at some level, this discussion is propelled by how
art plays in a disposable culture.  Will the image, as a technological
output, or is the image already viewed as disposable, less
resonant than the word.  Rather than driven by the inertia of
art, it appears that we are driven by its dissipation behind us:
art fuelled like Wile E. Coyote--driven because the bridge is
collapsing behind him, not because there is something on the
other side.

The 'Ern Malley Affair' had a profound effect on poetry in Australia. It is
possible to argue that it was one of the main reasons why modernism
virtually bypassed Australian poetry until the late sixities. It took a
younger group of poets - John Tranter's so-called Generation of 68 - to
storm the journals and over turn the applecart in the late sixities.

I have wanted to read that book for a while.  In a review I read
somewhere, the reviewer noted, if I remember correctly, that John Ashbery
apparently once used Malley in a final exam for a modern poetry course:  the
exam has two poems, one by "Malley" and one by Kreymborg or some other
modernist they haven't read.  Anyway, no information is included with the
poems.  The question goes like this: one of these is a forgery/parody, one
is by a "legitimate" modern poet.  Which one? Write an essay defending
your choice.
 
I have wanted to steal that question ever since.
 
Cheers,
David

yay charles. first i shd say that i was so moved by your earlier suggestion that
the alphabet be considered a technology that i incorporated it (with proper
citation) into a paper i'm working on with a friend --about of all things, women
as textile workers and intellectual workers --in which the question concerning
technology and women looms (pun partially intended) pretty large. my friend is
also a western agricultural historian, and her current research project involves
indigenous women's non-plow agricultural technology. many books on women and
tech have yet to be written, unless, as yuo have suggested, the common
understanding of tech. be considerably widened.  --md

Dear All,
 
Not sure what the point of this exercise is--seems kinda pretentious to
me.  But hey, I'm as pretentious as the next guy/gal, maybe moreso.  So
here's my contribution to the onerous summer reading list:
 
1) Richard Shusterman, _Pragmatist Aesthetics_, Blackwell 1992.  Chap. 2
gives a concise history of the study of aesthetics that might be relevant
to those involved with the thread on art & aesthetics a while back.
 
2) Hilary Putnam, _Realism with a Human Face_.  Pragmatism in a
non-Rortian/poststructuralist key.
 
3) Theodor Adorno, _Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic_, trans. &
intro. by Robert Hullot-Kenter.  Hullot-Kenter read a mind-blowing paper
at BlaserFest '95 on the link between ethics & aesthetics.  In view of
the dominance of the market in shaping aethetic values and reception
and the cancellation of the possibility of meaningful ethical reflection
by pervasive multinational corporate capitalism, he asked, what's
the point of beating this non-issue to death?  Touche'.
 
4) Rod Smith's _The Boy_ & Jeff Derkson's _Dwell_ (poems).
 
5) Aerial 8 (fantastic issue) and Raddle Moon 13, special section on
"Woman/Writing/Theory."  And just in: Situation 9 (thanks Mark!).
 
6) Edgar O'Hara, _Cedazo Tan Chucaro_.  Anyone else interested in
this dynamite Peruvian poet?
 
7) Leslie Anne Boldt-Irons, _On Bataille: Critical Essays._
 
8) Don Byrd, _The Poetics of the Common Knowledge_.  Indispensable wisdom.
 
9) Paul Fry, _A Defense of Poetry_.  Possibly dispensable wisdom.
 
10) Robert Musil's _The Man without Qualities_.  Where has this guy been
all my life?  A serious revelation.  _Five Women_ (just finished) also
amazing.
 
11) _The Guitar Handbook_.  Oh, and if Hank Lazar can mention Coltrane as
bedside reading, let me mention Mingus' _Ah hum_ and _Mingus Dynasty_,
serious jazz for serious hepcats.
 
I read these simultaneously while standing on my head and composing
violin sonatas using aleatoric methods derived from chaos theory.
Pretentious enough for ya?

Ashbery's exam question, is told in The Ern Malley Affair pp. 233-4 (which

Blake thought so--that's why he was against it (it messed with his notion of
visionary individualism).  The scientific paradigm, that product of the Age
of Reason, is basically an agreed-upon set of assumptions about the way the
world works, which becomes the basis for all scientific work (Cf. Thomas S.
Kuhn, _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_.)

And since Heidegger's name has been popping up lately, I'll throw this in:
 
"the poet also uses the word--not, however, like ordinary speakers and
writers who have to use them up, but rather in such a way that the word only
now becomes and remains truly a word" ("Origin of the Work of Art")
 
Tetsuaki Kotoh, interpreting this stance, writes that :
 
"As *Gerede* ["idle talk" or "chatter"], language...provides comfort and
security by giving everything out as unmysterious and self-evident...[but at
times] language as *Gerede* collapses and is no longer viable...when the
meaning-relations of everyday language collapse as a whole, one is thrown
into an incomprehensible chaos of phenomena without meaning...the world
becomes disconnected from language and floats by itself...one is unable to
speak...the moment of combustion is pure silence beyond where language is
exhausted...there the primordial reality of the world, which cannot be
reached by language, keeps silently boiling up...the language of the true
self emerges from this silence."(in _Heidegger and Asian Thought_, U of
Hawaii Press, 1987)

Maria,
 
I enthusiastically recommend for a solid intro. Walter Ong's book
Orality and Literacy (re. alphabet as tech, etc.).  I guess the alphabet
is inevitably to be seen as a technology since it comes with writing.
You might want to look at Hand's End by David Rothenberg who builds on
Heidegger; R argues that language is a technology (I'm only half
convinced and doubt I'll go the other half but who knows?).
 
Also I recommend Evelyn Fox Keller's books especially the earlier stuff
though the later is more elaborated but more hastily written and thus
for me not as satisfying a read. Also Marion Namenwirth's stuff. Both
address women and science / women and technology mostly having to
do with the way the cultures of science and tech work and showing how
scientific knowledge is "skewed" by male perceptions. Very interesting
and at times even exciting stuff.

Somebody mentioned Avital Ronnell and I think Stein was also cited.
 
I would add Donna Haraway's _Simians, Cyborgs and Women_ (her
"Manifesto for Cyborgs," included here, was first published in
Socialist Review). Still the best single source on "pomo" topics there
is.
 
Anything by Sandra Harding on feminism & science would also be of
value, tho she is, by nature, a more "normative" academic author.
Meaghan Morris (sp?) has done work on malls that would be good to
juxtapose with Baudelaire & w/ Benjamin on Baudelaire. (and, generally,
I don't agree that people have gone beyond Benjamin in writing on
technology, with the possible exception of Haraway. Benjamin's work has
brought forth an enormous amount of deritive drivel, attempts at a
politicized MacLuhanism. But it's precisely how he is NOT a MacLuhan
that is of interest.
 
I'd add Kathy Acker and several poets whose work shows up in discussion
on this list.
 
There are real questions of genre that also enter into this discussion.
 
 
Just a thought,
