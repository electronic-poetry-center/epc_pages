Subject:  where the boys are  
    
"Why don't more women post" is a rhetorical      
question, right?  Everyone knows *why.*   
    
(Or did you mean, "where are all the poster      
girls?")   
    
Camille P. might say it's because we are  
neither skilled nor schooled in the art of       
directional peeing -- although *her* urine       
describes a pretty well-targeted arc. 
    
Ron and Spencer, I extend my hand in gratitude   
for your chivalrous patronage ;-] And Joe, you   
sound like a sister. You all employed 
one of the pedagogic strategies I suggested in   
my first posting out of three in total, (which   
was about the reluctance to speak):   
teaching the verbally aggressive to   
use gambits to draw out silent interlocuters.    
    
My second posting was a short one I intended as      
a respectful message about a poet whose works I      
love.  I did not realize someone might find it   
offensive, and just, uh, shot it off.  It's the      
one Ira called "dumb" and reacted to so   
vehemently.  He and I have since had a volley    
of private e-mails first furious, then    
apologetic, with invitations to continue the     
dialogue.      
    
Public nudity.  Like this posting.    
    
For a day though I was traumatized by my first   
experience of being flamed as I walked the       
streets of Tokyo in a tormented stupor    
wondering if I really was *dumb*.     
    
I have already pointed out to Ira the irony of   
that choice of adjective.     
    
Anyway that's why I don't post or speak so much      
in male-dom public forums, although my voice is      
always wanting to vibrate.    
    
Is it so imperative that we (girls, I mean)      
seize the reins of (mainly male) academic    
discourse? Maybe, but I'd rather be on a  
different kind of horse, and take off the    
stupid uncomfortable bridle -- and be free to    
let Pegasus(sa) go where she wants, like I       
just wanted to say that I wanted the horse to    
be a pink one, not in spite of it being a dumb   
thing to say but precisely because it is dumb,   
and liking the fresh coy challenging dumb    
hollow echo that bounces off it.  
    
    
Dumbness has unexplored potential in poetic(s)   
language, (especially in this age of acedemic    
piranha-ism) at least as a backlash or contrast      
or as a kid beholding a naked emperor.  The      
dumbness of koans. 
    
I read in a lot of poetics list postings  
desires to "get things hammered out once and     
for all" -- to be right.  Being right is not     
always essential to me when I'm having a  
conversation -- which act can be conceived of    
as an opportunity to swap paradigms.  Is the     
calendula more right than the hyacinth?  How     
would *you* define "flesh-colored," or "eye-     
level"?    
    
I may be falling into the trap of analyzing      
discourse from the perspective of biological     
determinism -- intellectually suspect (I just    
came back from a great performance of Henry VI,      
in which Queen Margaret -- admittedly a   
character developed by The Boy Bard -- verbally      
kicked ass harder than anybody), but  
empirically observable, too.      
    
Like the frequency of qualifiers in "women's"    
language.  Re-read this message for   
conditionals, maybes, seems, etc.  Or that men   
often (another qualifier) have two voices    
(surely countless more), a public "war" voice    
-- often heard on this list -- and a personal    
voice, more modulated.  As Tom Mandel's former   
secty. (Tom, you did call me "honey" now and     
then) and B.Watten's former student, I should    
know.      
    
    
I like this list best when information ideas     
observations parodies accrue, not when it    
sounds like a dogfight that needs hosing down.   
Even then I like this list a lot, even if it is      
d***-wagging bigshot-laden and, as one woman     
writer wrote to me "boys talking about boys'     
books".  It's a techno-miracle for me to be      
privy to its world while I'm marooned on this    
archipelago.   
    
Later, fellas. Nada (Gordon)

Preface: haven't had time to fully digest all the prolific writing on the   
relation between theory and poetry, but hazard an appearance I will....     
    
Text: I wanted to respond to Spencer's comment that theory/art have not     
impacted or have failed to impact people's lives.  Two points: 1) Isn't     
this a very aestheticist postion?  I'm sure the answer is yes, and that's   
fine, but this faith in art as having any ... responsibility or ability     
to change people's live has fallen under serious scepticism.  I'm not   
trying to  reduce Spencer's position to a humanism--and that in itself  
would not be such a bad thing--but how can we not face the fact that art    
itself has not saved us from ourselves? This point has been raised by   
others....  2) Thoreau and/or Emerson make the point that reading their     
texts should change the reader, that reading them should provoke the    
reader into states of change,that the reader should undergo and be      
willing to undergo change (a la Peter Carafiol).  I return to literature    
and art of all sorts because I continually find things that challenge me    
to think in different ways--Emerson of the divinity school   
address--rather than in static and calcified institutions (no matter what   
some may think).  However, for all this usefulness of art, for all its  
ability to offer visions of difference and change . . . or simply beauty    
doesn't it seem somewhat limiting to hold art responsible for humanizing    
us?  I sort of feel (I'm not sure, in other words, but suspect) that what   
is needed is a view of art that is able to avoid the humanizing and     
colonizing functions of art/literature . . . a position that also does  
not reduce its complexity and multiplicity to beautiful objects.    
    
Refrain: I will now quickly peruse all the previous entries and see how     
much I've repeated of others's statements . . . .

oh, and I forgot the most important thing:  I too feel Spencer's    
disappointment (if I can characterize it as such) that art/theory has not   
impacted people's lives more . . . .  But is that art/theory's failure or   
our own?  I include myself in this collective Our here . . . .

which he communicates with the list and strives to address others with

The interpersonal too is political. You know you can trust me, and so   
you are correct to tell me, in confident confidence, "with my gender    
of partner preference defined, I can flirt passionately and we both     
enjoy it". On the way home, I feel real recalling you say this. It'd    
have been funny to make a joke of it then, or made a joke of something  
else you've said months ago, turning the present moment always into     
a lyric poem theory commercial with a punchline. It is real fun now     
not to have made fun of you then, the trust has made real men of us.    
    
Or we turn to other cultures. Peter says, from a source, but it is an   
idea for my purposes, "with writing, in the first place, and the    
distribution of writing, in the second place, comes growth of idealist  
thinking." We have no memory of having been reincarnated. I wrote this  
for myself several lifetimes back. I knew there would be no visual      
flashback, that I would only have a sense of a familiar past of     
writing, actually written be me aeons back, and use a (re)writing to    
see myself there, writing myself to death for myself in the future.     
    
Growth is also a fungus. I consider what Justine Frischmann says in     
the March issue of Sky, "when you're in your twenties, being monogamous,    
especially fronting a band, isn't a horror to transgress. Damon     
read what I said about his flings, in Sky, and laughed". I'm walking.   
I have the thought that marriage mustn't be broken, like the pentameter     
was feared to be being broken, a superstition held to like a formal     
practice, and so much blame dumped on marriage break-up and not how,    
not the interpersonal time with the children, care where you put foot.  
    
Or call it a political football. Carla Harryman answers a question,     
"certain forms of thinking are simply kept quiet, kept away, kept hidden.   
There are few locations in a public or social sense to value the creative"  
- from _A Suite of Poetic Voices_. Underlining on the typewriter is like    
a twelve string guitar, if the former is electronic and the latter is   
acoustic. So that in a culture of good locations, the interpersonal     
spaces made in community, the theatre of conversation in a platonic     
space where our ideas play as we discuss things in words, lessen writing.   
    
I am not telling you this. Derrida says in the Post Card "there is      
the I of lover, the you of lover, the I that fears, the you that fears,     
the four of us, the fear of us and us". Paraphrase/troop. I wrote   
that too when I was nineteen, and about the thousand cuts of 
stepping on upturned plugs. I stepped on a plug just now, it hurt   
like memory. I love my readers non-sexually. I send letters and they go     
over not under your head, my intended heart-to-heart became a history   
of the city. By map we twist through streets, lists of locked doors.

    ALBANY (AHP) -- Officers of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco      
and Chapbooks (BATC) have surrounded the barricaded multi-media     
lab in the basement of the Humanities building at the University    
at Albany where a small band of writers, artists and miscellany,    
reportedly led by poeticult figure Chris Funkhouser, have    
sequestered themselves, stockpiling software, poetry, audio and     
video equipment. Speculation is that this group may be a splinter   
faction of the Branch Derridean cult which occupied that same       
compound last winter.     
    Funkhouser, who refuses to communicate with government      
officials except through the internet, e-mailed the BATC officers   
stationed outside the lab to announce that his group, ``... simply      
wished to live an alternative publishing lifestyle.''

    ``We want to be left alone,'' Funkhouser pleaded, ``We      
will come out when _The Little Magazine_ has been produced on       
CD-Rom. We are exercising our constitutional right to digitize.''   
    Sergeant Douglas Messerli of the BATC swat team says he     
and his commandos are monitoring the situation for any changes,     
``We hope it won't not be necessary to bring in the heavy mimeo     
and stapleguns but we'll do whatever's necessary. We're not sure    
how they're holding out in there. We are doing our best to stop     
the flow of poetry in and out of their compound.''   
    Albany Speaker of the Common Knowledge Donald J. Byrd has   
sought to distance himself from the cult crisis, but sources close      
to the situation believe that he may be directly involved with an   
underground smuggling ring suspected of supplying the cult members      
with poetry and other necessities.    
    Chris Stroffolino, Secretary of the Department of Reality,      
has called for a censure of Byrd whom he says withheld from his     
department knowledge that Funkhouser was entertaining delusions of      
an Imaginary University.      
    Meanwhile, BATC officials remain puzzled about a suspected

flow of contraband materials in and out of the compound. 
    ``We can't figure out how they're getting past us,'' said   
a frustrated BATC spokesperson Lawrence Ferlinghetti, ``But we have     
reason to believe that they are forcibly digitizing work by Charles     
Bernstein, Anne Tardos, Jackson Mac Low, Madeline Gins, Will 
Alexander and others even as we speak.''  
    Self-appointed Prime Minister of Literary Video, Richard    
Kostelanetz, has voiced characteristically outspoken support for    
the cult's activities while being careful to note that he is 
suspicious of their possible connection with Foreign Minister of    
Antology, Pierre Joris, who failed to include Kostelanetz's work

I love the idea of "delurking" - like "decloaking" in Star Trek...      
    
I echo Kali Tal's annoyance at the homogeneity, and applaud her post. It's actua
mark of difference one has to inscribe to signal non-assimilable content also   
has costs, or at least this is how I feel having had to use it myself. What 
Nada says about the "wartalk" of a lot of posters publically rings very true,   
of myself too - since I went on the warpath, as Cris noted, over what I     
perceived as a flippancy about mental illness in her very genuine concerned 
posting for Bernadette Mayer, language "deficiency" as mental "defiency" in 
so much writing about aphasia (eg Jakobson's) - Nada has since put me right 
privately that she meant no such flippancy. I just wonder, as a campaigner  
for children's rights, ablism, and AIDS awareness, what *gender* such issues    
have, or are thought to have. Or perhaps: what gender does anger about such 
issues, or what issues, have? I was really furious about what I say as an   
attack on the vulnerable, so I used attention-seeking tactics, and angered  
Nada, when I found out privately I had a lot to learn from her/you. Sometimes   
accepting the right to anger of participants in a debate deemed gendered is,    
for me anyway, a vital precondition to creating a space where I learn from  
the person whose anger I accept (I'm very much talking about anger in this  
disembodied, non-physically-threatening e-space). It isn't the exclusion or 
the feeling invisible that bothers me, not in e-space, it's just boredom    
with the batting around of fixed positions and no-one learning from each    
other.     
    
I say this in honesty, hope I don't seem to be discounting Kali or Nada's   
postings, very mucch support more woman-talk. I don't know if this is any   
other internetter's experience but I tend to delete certain regulars unread,    
so that what I see is the list I get. I would definitely read anything  
posted by Kali or Nada.       
    
Very best,

    Actually I am not sure what Parmenides meant,    
and I doubt that any one does.  He clearly did _not_     
mean that change is not possible.  The clear theme of    
his poem is spiritual transformation. 
    
    The various attempts to formalize the logic  
are takes on Zeno's paradoxes.    
    
    It seems highly likely that Zeno did not     
understand his teacher.  Students failing to understand  
their teachers is fairly common.  
    
    I quite agree that poetry is world-making,   
which seems to me quite a task.  I can't imagine why     
one would not want to use all of the tools that one  
might have at hand.    
    
    Some one noted that my statements seemed too     
pat, and I think they probably are. However, I have  
found that this medium, at least in its present state,   
filters subtle discourse.     
    
     Apparently I was not pat enough to make     
my point clear.    
    
    There is a poetry that sees theory as a      
supplement (e.g. in order to get it you have to read     
the poets theoretical essays or Derrida or someone),     
and there is a poetry that takes responsibility for  
the theory in the verse itself (it helps to have to read 
Whitehead in order to understand the _Maximus_ but all   
the necessary stuff is taken into the poem itself). Thus,    
the poem is not an a mere example...  
    
    Of course, it is perfectly possible to say "I    
do not want to read dry awful theory. I am afraid it     
will rot my mind with jargon and the dreariness of its prose."      
    
    This is a real danger and a reasonable fear.     
    
    However, a very large part of the world we   
inhabit (if not the world we build) is theoretical.  
    
    This machine by which I am commuting is only     
incidentally a thing.  Above all it is a theory, about   
which, I suspect, most of us are quite vague.    
    
    And, of course, to the extent that language  
as such is constructed, it too has a theory...   
    
    The fact seems to be that at least in this culture,  
the _power_ is with the theorists (e.g. engineers).  Perhaps 
the problem with poetry is not theory but bad theory.    
    
    When it comes time for us to demo, we often  
seem nothing to show as complex and workable as, say,    
the internet.

Why do I, as a male (non-female?) lurker, lurk as much as I do and, when I  
post, only post briefly and relatively safely? I'd partly been rationalizing    
it by telling myself I didn't have the time and/or that I didn't have much to   
add to what was already being said. But Charlotte Pressler's recent post in 
response to the "boy talk" issue really spoke exactly to my feelings too about  
use of this forum. I'm much, much comfortable working ideas through in  
conversation, with all the cues and body language and possibilities for     
instant restatement, clarification, negotiation, etc. that that allows than I   
am on the net, where I feel compelled (this may be my issue, I realize, but I   
suspect I'm not alone) to look smart, informed, thoughtful, whatever, to an 
audience many of whom I know but many of whom I don't. And if literal   
face-to-face conversation isn't available, which it usually isn't, I'm more 
comfortable working things "privately" in writing, drafting, redrafting,    
rethinking, before going public. It may just be that I haven't yet learned to   
use this medium or the list in a way that works for me and that also    
contributes to others. The disjunctiveness of e-mail exchanges fazes    
me--putting something forth one day, processing someone's response or   
responses two days later when I've already forgotten what I said. And I also    
share Spencer's feeling that whatever I say on here, I'm immediately    
dissatisfied with, and I haven't yet adjusted to living with a dissatisfaction  
that I sense may be intrinsic to the use of the list.    
    
I've learned a good deal from all the recent posts on this, so thanks to    
Charlotte, B. Cass Clarke, Nada, Kali (my apologies if I'm leaving anyone   
out--trying to backtrack in my head over what I've read the last few days) for  
your open and instructive responses, and Ron for bringing it up.    
    
Am I the only one who finds tone hard to read on the net? I sense not, from 
what Ira Lightman said in a recent post. I often can't tell, esp. when  
someone's sounding snitty or high-handed or whatever, whether they're kidding   
or not, and that makes me reluctant to respond--I find this particularly with   
the more cryptic one- and two-line messages. Yeah, I guess I could ask them .   
. .    
    
As far as I can tell, no-one here has noted the recent passing of James     
Merrill. A week or so ago, I believe, though I haven't seen an obit, just   
heard about it. Merrill readers on this list are few and far between, I     
imagine, but I always found him pretty interesting if one wanted to consider    
matters of artificeand absorption and authenticity.  
    
One final thread: I've got to back Cris on Hokey Cokey. Maybe it's becawse I'm  
a Londoner (as another such pub song goes), but I only ever heard Cokey     
growing up east of London, and only encountered Pokey when I came to the U.S.   
For years I just assumed that it was one of those things that Americans     
couldn't get right (just as when I first moved to Chicago, I complained to  
people about their defective, non-Francophone pronunciation of Notre Dame [as   
in University of]. )   
    
I also never heard in the English version (or my English version) the verse 
that asks you to put your whole self in. That seems a particularly      
un-postmodern injunction.     
    
OK, I'll shut up now.

Dear Mike Boughn,  
    
Perhaps I'm a bit late in saying this, but I like your "engendering,    
particle accelerator statement" also. I believe that the way all things     
are both fragmenting and connecting is so great as to be incomprehensible,  
literally beyond belief. This is one big reason why our beliefs and     
explanations cannot be fully trusted. 
    
When we go from a general sense of life's richness to explanations that     
are more specific, that is when the trouble starts. We cannot formulate or  
rationally comprehend this richness, its fluid order and connections, its   
complexity and unceasing fragmentation. We all have our awareness of this,  
dare I say, totality. But I believe art is better-suited to expressing or   
dealing with it than theory.      
    
We don't have to make an either/or choice between theory and art, but   
there are very real dangers when those who seem to be the more      
knowledgeable authorities of an art side with claims for the necessity of   
theoretical formulations with respect to that art. James, Tom and Don Byrd  
may balk at my implication that they are adopting authoritative stances,    
but I believe that is exactly what they are doing. In fact, that may be     
the biggest problem with the statements they have been making on this   
forum.

   Dear Alan GOlding--thank you for your comments on "tone"--Actually,  
   that is an issue I am extremely interested in not only in this forum     
   but in writing in general. I'm curious if there's any thoughts about     
   TONE, as a form/content issue, as a question of moods, of ideological    
   state apparati, whatever. If "tone" is "beyond good and evil" and    
   "beyond right and wrong" then is it something that is automatically  
   humanist (in a retro derogatory way) as a concern and should not be  
   theorized and thus taken for granted and thus the emotional appeal of    
   rhetoric becomes either lazily anarchic and "all over the place" or  
   one may end up in that "toneless tone" that allegedly is a sign of   
   "clear thinking" and "authenticity" (despite the self-conscious      
   theatricality...)?     Chris

INITIAL REPORT FROM PHILADELPHIA  
    
On Saturday, February 11, a "Forum to Maintain Support for the Arts &   
Humanities" was held at The Great Hall on the University of Pennsylvania    
campus.  Co-organized by Bob Perelman, Susan Stewart, and Gil Ott, the  
event featured upwards of 20 speakers from the dance, music, theater,   
visual arts, literary, and educational communities.  
    
Perelman estimates the 70 people attended the two-hour event and reports    
that media coverage was good. On Sunday, the Philadelphia Inquirer ran a    
story on page 2 of its Metro section. On Monday, event-participant Julia    
Blumenreich (poet, editor, and public school teacher) was the subject of an 
Inquirer Op-Ed piece about art in the classroom.  The Daily Pennsylvania (U 
Penn's newspaper) ran a front-page article on the forum and reporters for   
several other magazines and papers are planning to run pieces as well.  All 
of this is in addition to Perelman's own op-ed piece ("Government by    
Irritation") in the Sunday Feb 5 Inquirer.       
    
More details as they become available.    
    
REPRESENTATIVE GOODLING OF PENNSYLVANIA   
    
Staying in Pennsylvania for a moment, Republican Rep. Bill Goodling is  
chair of the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities.     
Recently, Goodling has called for a 3-year "phase-out" of the NEA.  If you  
know people in Goodling's district (which includes York and Gettsburg, but  
what about Shippensburg?), it is crucial that they speak up for arts    
funding.  For more information, contact Anne Burt of the Literary Network   
(1-212-941-9110).  
    
ORGANIZATIONAL QUESTIONS (OR, THE ART OF PRACTICE)   
    
In his note to us about Saturday's events in Philly, Bob Perelman writes:   
"The most intriguing possibility is the most difficult to implement. There  
were many committed people from a range of different arts. We passed around 
a mailing list--but what is the next step??"     
    
The transition from discrete event to ongoing project is a fairly difficult 
one.  But as Ray Rickman told the audience at Freely Espousing-Providence,  
this fight will not be won unless people are willing to do something    
*everyday.*  The task in the coming weeks is simple enough: we have to  
outwrite the right.    
    
But how can that task be accomplished? As the focus turns local how do we   
gaurd against isolation?  What should the next wave of synchronized events  
look like?  How can we be sure that the makers, and not only the managers,  
of culture play a part in the national debate?   
    
The key is to make the prospect of participation *interesting.*  If artists 
and writers can't do that, who can?   
    
We encourage everyone who is receiving these updates to think through at    
both a local and a national level the question about how to continue and    
expand these  efforts.  Open, imaginative debate is one resource we have    
that the tightly organized, well-funded, religious right cannot afford.     
    
    
WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO IN PROVIDENCE   
    
In Providence, we shifted fairly quickly after the 1/28 event toward    
planning our role in a broad forum on the Balanced Budget Amendment that    
will take place on 2 March.  The work is of the always essential/sometimes  
tedious kind: attending meetings, xeroxing fliers, working phone banks,     
etc.  Still, it's the kind of action we're happy to be involved with since  
the objective is coalition building.  
    
Meanwhile, we keep trying to expand our means of communication: exploring   
the possibility of establishing a list-serve (an as-yet unresolved      
question), hooking up to Arts Wire, informing people about what *FE* is and 
what has happened so far, educating ourselves about legislative processes,  
and so forth.  
    
We also spent some time assessing what relationship we wanted to adopt to   
existing arts organizations.  At this point, we've decided to remain an     
indepedent project and to seek alliances on that basis.  The drawback to    
that decision is that we remain for the most part without resources.  The   
advantage is that we don't waste time in intra-organizational squabbles and 
we don't have to submit our thinking and action to an established "line" on 
how and whom to organize.

Dear Nada,     
    
I appreciated your post a lot. Specifically I liked the stuff you said  
about "dumb." My feeling about it is, there are many kinds of dumb. Some    
kinds may be easier to detect, but often those kinds are less significant   
than kinds which are not so apparent. 
    
I'm thinking of a forest and trees. And in this forest there are some   
really big trees, some trees one could get lost in, maybe for years or  
even a lifetime. Men are very good at this. I don't know if it's an innate  
talent they--I'm sorry--we have, or something passed on and built up,   
primarily through the course of Western Civilization.    
    
What do you think? 
    
Spencer

Subject:  More Boy Talk   
    
Sigh.      
    
Let's look at what's happened.    
    
Some well meaning male person asked why women don't post more often on POETICS. 
Several women "delurked" and answered the question, giving various and  
substantial explanations.  A few men commented on the question itself, or on    
the responses given by the women.  But only Spencer Selby has attempted to  
directly draw any of the women into a conversation by responding to her     
*ideas* or *assertions*.      
    
Alan Golding wrote that Charlotte Pressler's post spoke to *his* feelings of    
isolation and, thanking Charlotte and the rest of us for addressing     
something of importance to him, changed the topic to a discussion of "tone" 
in espace.  Still under the heading "Boy Talk" (which is always already the 
proper subject line), Chris Stroffolino thanked *Alan Golding* for his  
comments on "tone" and asked Alan a direct question, providing a jumping-off    
place for a conversation between men, effectively appropriating the "Boy    
Talk" header, and bringing us back to where we started.  
    
Sheesh. Double sheesh.    
    
IF YOU WANT MORE WOMEN TO POST ON THIS LIST YOU GOTTA *TALK* TO 'EM.  I know    
that's a really hard idea to grasp--revolutionary even--but that's what you 
gotta do.      
    
Triple sheesh.     
    
    *We now return you to our regularly scheduled programming.*

Subject:  parmenides, poet ***and*** theoretician    
    
parmenides was a poet: what is extant of his work is a poem! [so perhaps he did 
not mean it?]  
    
He had what some people may call a naive theory of meaning: that if you name    
something it exists someplace. Since you cannot name what is not, then what is  
not is not--it does not exist anyplace. There is only stuff, all over the   
place, filling the place, and there is no boundary between the place and    
nothing because there is no nothing. For him, the universe is infinite (not 
finite as some 20th century dudes think).    
    
And, yes, since nothing cannot yield anything, change is impossible and     
therefore illusory.    
    
He perpetrated this monstrous blow to common sense in his poem.     
But, remember, it was a poem.     
So it's ok?    
    
Well, no, because he was the father of metaphysics based on bad language    
theory.

kalital,   
    
Your skill at email gives me hope that posting and reading are things worth 
learning how to do.  I even saved your Boy Talk message to my hard drive.  I    
don't do that very often.     
    
Anyway, I've been wondering what the value is here.  
    
I like the informational posts (in fact I'd like to see more about      
events/readings, and new books, mixed in with a poem or two, informal book  
reviews maybe, why not review the AHP?)   
    
Thanks for starting to clear things up.

Dear Jeffrey,  
    
I can't agree that my concern for the failure of art to impact people's     
lives is just aesthetic. Nor do I think it's a case of my humanism--at least    
not a humanism which might be historically defined as an ism.       
    
I think if you don't care about change then all you've got is art for   
art's sake. I'm talking about anything that changes people outside of   
their relationship to art. This would be a pretty broad definition of   
change, which includes social and political change as well as changes that  
are more exclusive to the individual, or changes that are psychological     
and/or spiritual.  
    
I believe art/poetry has failed to bring about much change, viewed from     
any of these angles. What's mostly aesthetic is the success of this art,    
I'm sorry to say.  
    
Caring about change means facing this failure, and not being happy about    
it, not giving up or settling for a success that will be bracketed in the   
name of poetry or art. A lot of theory is addressed to this problem, or     
aspects of it--I certainly will acknowledge that. What I share most with    
the theorists may be this concern for change, this refusal to accept human  
society as it has been or is. What I do not share is the theorists' faith   
in the power of their theories, their belief that theories should be    
effective if they sound right, or if they are based upon extensive      
knowledge and good analysis.      
    
    
Please remember, I am talking about the effectiveness of art theory in  
bringing about changes outside of these bracketed aesthetic and     
intellectual worlds. Remember also that my skepticism does not mean I   
think theory is completely worthless or that it can play no role in a future    
which I too have not given up on.     
    
More on this later. For now I thank you for your thoughts, and your kind    
words. I am glad some of my statements have engaged you. I also have been   
engaged by some of yours.

Organization: The University of Auckland  
Subject:  Re: A Cockney Sparrow   
    
"as yet unsubstantiated       
Pokey flavour from Auckland".     
    
"Questions follow: 
    
1.The East London version always starts with 'you put you left (whatever)   
leg in' and so on - I'm worried that the folk myth has got lost in its  
translation to connect Pokey with a reorientation towards the right foot,   
can you or anybody else here possibly clear this up? Otherwise the      
ramifications of possible relations between Losely (high culture ice cream  
manufacturers but arguably Cockney rhyming slang for Mosely - as in Oswald  
and his blackshirts, resurgent in East London even as we post) and      
Mussolini will lead to melted sleep." 
    
Well, I'm glad the penny (cent or dime or whatever) has finally     
dropped...  Yes, of course "Right" in this context does not have a      
serious political implication.  What politician or poet has ever    
stopped participating in the social dance, the Hokey-Cokey (or Pokey    
or Tokey) when required to put the Right anything In?  None, I      
suppose.   
    
The relation of poetry to theory is the issue (or so I understand it    
from the previous correspondence).  The song that propels the       
social dance, in so far as it may be taken as a poem, commonly      
disengages dancers from couple-dancing to participate in a species of   
exhibitions of sometimes ludicrous and sometimes erotic wagglings   
in which all share.  The politics of the song could be derived from     
this, its apparent function, at "parties".  And its relation to     
theory could well be seen in its intentional relation to the effect     
produced.  So "that's what it's all about...... ----- .....".       
    
[Note: "that's what it's all about" is usually followed by a shouted    
word that like the name of the song varies from location to location    
and sometimes from person to person.  It can be Hey, Hi, or sometimes   
See.  I prefer " See" because Seeing what something is about is what    
may be termed Theory.     
    
Taking this as the beginnings of a sketch of a paradigmatic case of     
the relation between poetry and theory may be of benefit to the     
somewhat blurry discourse surrounding these two nouns when taken in     
conjunction.   
    
Agreeing with everybody on this, I would suggest that the bafflement    
over the supposed relation between Poetry and Theory, may be somewhat   
alleviated, when in all cases of poems, functioning and  
engendered response patterns are carefully observed.     
    
I suppose that at all times (and I am aware I may be alone in this)     
that poems are items for recitation or recital, that they are either    
to be recited by their readers, and if not aloud and before an      
audience, then thought of that way.  Reading poems by oneself is a      
fantasy situation of sorts, where one is searching for something that   
will be effective as song or fable, narrative or moral exposition   
(sometimes), or some sometimes absurd ridiculous and provocative    
contradiction of these (to be modern about it), when an occasion for reading    
 aloud should present itself.     
    
Caution: this is not a recurrence to "speech" as the origin of      
writing.  This is rather a belief that poetry is for speaking aloud     
and that the reading of it in silence to oneself supposes at some   
time a reading aloud.  The silent reading being about as complete as    
the silent reading of a musical score.    
    
I agree with James Sherry as to poetry and theory.  I also agree with   
some of his rather noisy opponents that arriving at a fully  
articulated theoretical standpoint (a whole book, a discourse) as a means of    
generating poems at all is not quite what is wanted.  Nevertheless,     
poems are written or otherwise composed by people who expect 
something of the results and in that respect there is always a      
theoretical intention.    
    
I believe that it would not be difficult to substantiate the view   
that Lang-Po was concerned with theory, because      
of a seeming denial by many poets in the 70's that they needed to   
reflect on their theoretical positions, and the belief that as a    
result many 70's poets were becoming ineffectual as poets.   
    
This comes from someone who in recent terminology must be counted   
as of Generation Minus One, but with sympathies in the later 70's and   
1980's for G1 AND ALSO for a lot of G Minus One and Minus Two poets.    
(And Minus 3,4,5,6....)       
    
I thought this all could be done with a lighter touch, around       
questions of Hokey-Tokey, -Pokey and -Cokey.  But I guess    
the above heaviness is a necessary resort.  Should I put this down to   
the present employment of  poets teaching Graduates instead of      
Liberal College Undergraduates?   
    
My wife, like her father, is for Tokey.

There was an obit for James Merrill in last weeks New York Times--Tues or   
Wed, I think.  
    
    
Would who ever posted the Stein conference at Pomona (or wherever) please   
repost it or send it my way, please?  I'm trying to find it but haven't     
had any luck.

I always catch my self saying poetry is a revolutionary force, within it    
lies the potential and the means for . . . achieving a different world.     
Then I catch my self again and say . . . but that faith, that belief is     
that the faith of modernism, that art itself can be a temporary stay    
against chaos?  And then I remember how Richard Rorty divorces the      
personal visions from the aesthetic creations/ideas of particular   
artists/intellectuals  because the types of change they desired would   
abhor us.  And I am left in a dilemma, part of which is the question:   
What sorts of change? And how or what in art provides for this course?  
    
> I believe art/poetry has failed to bring about much change, viewed from   
> any of these angles.    
    
Hence, the postmodern.  And I think the unhappiness you mention, not only   
about this situation but the inadequacy of theory to do more than   
promulgate analysi, is a difficult position to be in.  It amounts to the    
condition I've alluded to, of being in a position of needing to     
distance oneself from the uses to which art (widely defined) been put and   
which, also, doesn't simply reduce it to beauty and/or use.  I don't    
know.  I guess my view is given some shape my hesitation to revert to a     
position that reads/interprets art in some universalist-human-condition     
variety of analysis/appreciation: we need better tools.  I share your   
skepticism and hope for change (I'm alway interested in articulating the    
specifics, especially with a term like this), it's just I worry about   
harnessing art with such a responsibility as engendering change or being    
coterminus (?) with it--especially after its failure to do so.      
    
One last thought (for now): I believe it was you, Spencer, who made the     
point of needing to stay on a general level rather than specific because    
things (understanding? what was it?) tend to break down at that level.  
Part of my reading of Emerson/Thoreau/Whitman (derived from Carafiol and    
others) is that they are almost simultaneously able to move between such    
levels--hence part of the power of their texts.  Which move me.  Which  
encourage me toward change.  Perhaps we can compromise and articulate   
some issues--especially change--at that intermediary level and how that     
might be acheived through art.  Is this merging art and politics too    
closely?  I wouldn't want to hold art to any relation to politics that  
restricted it to performing such action . . . .  I've gone on long      
enough for now . . . .    
    
Thanks for chatting, Spencer.  Hope all is well on your end!

Yes, this is what I wanted to emphasize.  Emerson/Thoreau do this to an     
extent I find stunning.  If we can't "rationally comprehend this    
richness", though, Spencer, what sort of experience of art do we have.  
Kind of an obvious question, I suppose, but....  And does this "richness"   
have to do with change?  And is that change one of a "spiritual"    
quality?  And if so does that experience of art exclude it from being   
able to make the sorts of change you are interested in?

Alan--     
    
Well I will delurk as a (prior?) Merrill reader--always used to do him in   
my contemporary poetry course though front-end pressure and  
special-topics orientation at grad level (G-1 at any rate) has meant I  
haven't done so in a couple of years.  I never got as interested in all     
the ouji board stuff as some said one should; The Fire Screen and Briving   
the Elements where the books I liked best.  SOme of the ballad like poems   
-- though more narratively unpacked--stuff like, is it, "Days of 1935,"     
pick up on some of the demonic energies in Auden's terrific ballads in  
very nice ways; Willoware Cup reminds me of Bishop's "Poem (about the   
size of an old style dollar bill)"; and "Syrinx" is just plain terrific.    
Auden too is prolly not a big favorite here, but  I learned mostly the  
early Auden via Kenneth Koch at Columbia.  btw I've found myself looking    
at Kenneth's stuff again lately, off and on, and wondering too about    
what's interesting in NY School (or so-called so-called NY School) that     
didn't get fully picked up on in LangPo: my divided loyalties and   
surreptitious personal master plan in part.  more on this later; doan   
wanna put my whole self in just now....

Subject:  What about the lurkers? 
    
(... which provoked -- ?already-much-rehearsed -- musings about the     
particular characteristics of these discussions, perhaps worthy of      
consideration by those who take an active interest in the poetics of    
discourse.)    
    
    
The lurkers far outnumber a few decloaked, familiar voices which speak in a 
brightly-lit space but remain invisible.  
    
The voices of the speakers are emphatic, ringing with commitment; they  
often are fractious.   
    
The speakers appear to be speaking to each other. They do respond to one    
another. There are always replies waiting for them from the other speakers. 
The discussions become elaborate, self-refering, complex. The speakers have 
time to consider what they will say -- time which does not seem to exist    
for the lurkers, who simply hear by reading, now and then.   
    
But the speakers are not speaking to one another. If they wanted to do  
this, then they would simply correspond. They are speaking for the lurkers  
and for themselves. They are publishing their voices. What they say is  
uttered with the sense that they are overheard in the midst of their vital  
discussions.   
    
The speakers are not speaking. They are writing. Writing on the loosely     
gathered leaves of their next book. One day their words will be edited into 
shape. Before then they will be bound up and stored in an archive.      
    
Occasionally the lurkers decloak and speak. Everything changes.     
    
    
(... I'll resist the temptation to emerge from this mode of writing and     
make any of the analytic comments that spring to mind. Leave it to the  
lurkers?)

Q:  What's the difference between a good langpo      
    and a tree?    
    
A1: Nothing.   
A2: Everything.    
A3: The Answer, like the Question, is beside the point.  
A4: The tree, unlike the langpo, isn't preoccupied with  
    defining its position. It occupies it.       
    
Take your pick. I like A4 (& not just cause it's longer).    
Does theorize mean think about or write about what   
you think about - or maybe do these things in specific   
contexts or forums - as per this LIST.    
    
If I ask, what makes me feel welcome here, what's my     
qualification being here (apart from the gender      
and de-lurker invitations, which are lovely and      
help), I'd say it's cos I'm interested in intellectual   
discussion, specifically langpo-type speculations.   
This of course means I like the company, very much,  
even if I don't know the quality of your social or other 
lives.  Right now, don't care.    
    
So, it's a kind of community - I mean, there are     
commonnesses operating huh, of interests, of reading,    
of a pleasure in theorizing. Of stimulation and the  
pleasure - yeah maybe power too - of expression.     
    
Poetry and its theorizing I think don't have social  
or political or what have you functions.  Maybe the sense    
of responsibility  
comes from the feeling that we owe our patrons, now  
that our patrons/the market are in good part the     
state, hence society.     
    
I mean, it's opportunity and proclivity that connects    
us. What are the personal costs agains the pleasure of   
being on the LIST - does it come down to being a     
university-sponsored, mail- (oops, male-) dominated  
thing.     
    
The loop that leads back from such theory to its     
sponsoring society must necessarily get mediated beyond  
recognition,   
it's dishonest to claim responsibility for ourselves.    
At most, such responsibility is an indirect thng.    
    
Now maybe it's the processes of mediation running too & from 
langpo and its theorizers, job appointments, books   
published, conferences, earnings, what have you.  But    
theory has to do with what it theorizes, in this case    
literary stuff (&itself).     
    
It seems to me typically literature doesn't do well  
patronizing the patron.       
    
    
By the way, Tony, with the place you give sound/voice in 
poems where do you leave someone who just happens not to 
have heard poetry aloud, or a deaf someone.  I can't     
see the disadvantage.     
Surely one sensitivity being blocked serves well to  
open others?

Dear Don Byrd,     
    
I'm very surprised that you have no awareness of the downside of poetic     
theory, that you "can't imagine why one would not want to use all the   
tools that one might have at hand." Poetic theory, like all art theory,     
is used more as a weapon than as a tool of creation. Even if you disagree   
with the word "more" in that sentence, surely you're not so naive   
as to think this theory is only used to help with creation.  
    
Respectfully Yours,    
    
Spencer Selby  
    
P.S. Wanna trade publications (so we can see all that subtlety we've both   
been missing)? I'll send you a copy of my antitheory nonbook if     
you send me a copy of one of your most useful, optimistic tools.

Subject:  Thoughts on Theory  
    
Just spinning off Spencer's latest post (hi, Spencer!), I sense that much   
about theory (I fear I point to an abstraction rather than to any certain   
individual viewpoint) risks treatment as commodity, rather than as the fluid    
thing it is.  The dance of interplay between theory and practice means for me   
that there is always something to enjoy, closer to infinite ways of looking 
at a single entity.  It is as though one should not (consciously) stop, for 
fear of giving the nod to gravity and then falling for who knows how long.  
    
The pleasure of theory is certainly one of its big selling points, in   
addition to its power to locate, frame, describe, attune to resonances not  
previously picked up.

Can anyone out there confirm a point of Congressional procedure for us?  We 
have been told that it takes 218 votes in the House and 60 in the Senate to 
abolish a federal agency.  Since it appears the opponents of the NEA/NEH do 
not have those numbers, it would be cause for optimism if this is true  
(though of course the specter of an agency with no budget continues to  
loom).     
    
INITIAL REPORT FROM WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY   
    
We traveled out to Middletown, Connecticut last night to attend the event   
organized by AJ Weissbard at Wesleyan.  Roger Mandle (President of RISD)    
and George White (Eugene O'Neill Theater Center)--both members of the   
National Council on the Arts--spoke for about 20 minutes each, after which  
questions were solicited from the audience of approximately 150 people.     
    
Mr. White, who started the O'Neill Theater in 1964-65, emphasized the role  
of federal funds in supporting "young" institutions.  He noted that while   
the loss of NEA funds would lead to 5 new plays and 2 musicals/operas being 
cut from the O'Neill annual programme, the impact on less established   
organizations would be more drastic.  Faced with a shrinking base of    
corporate and foundational support, organizations that facilitate   
innovation and experimentation would be driven under, leaving only the  
"no-risk" institutions (Symphonies, Orchestras, Ballets) intact.    
    
President Mandle used his speech to attack the "narrow corridor" of thought 
being imposed by NEA opponents.  Switching with great facility between  
aesthetics & economics, Mandle argued that the arts are a "strategic asset" 
in the post-industrial world economy. Answering a frequently heard argument 
that since the NEA is of recent origin it can be eliminated without unduly  
affecting the nation's cultural life, Mandle noted that the automobile is   
also a fairly recent development but no one suggests that we eliminate it   
and go back to walking.       
    
Both Mandle and White emphasized the role that "design" plays in the lived, 
material environment of people who might not encounter art in other ways.   
Both men also called for increasing the visibility of Endowment support as  
a way of countering the conservative strategy of seizing on controversial   
exhibits and presenting them to the public as typical of what the Endowment 
does.  White suggested that plaques acknowledging NEA-support be    
distributed along with grant-monies and displayed everywhere that NEA money 
has been used.     
    
    
FEBRUARY 28 / NY ARTISTS OPPOSE CONTRACT  
    
(Anne Burt of LitNet forwarded the following press release yesterday.  As   
it happens, the Senate vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment--a key     
component of the GOP Contract--has just been set for the 28th as well.)     
    
    
For Immediate Release, 2/10/95    
    
A Gathering of Artists in Opposition to the Contract On America Featuring:  
    
Homer Erotic, Tuli Kupferberg, Emily XYZ & Myers, Bartlett, Matthew     
Courtney, John S. Hall, Todd Colby, Edwin Torres, Miguel Algarin, Eric  
Drooker and Others.    
    
Event will be hosted by Reno.     
    
On February 28th at 9 pm, artists against the Contract With  
America will assemble for an evening of readings, rants and riffs at The    
Fez, below Time Cafe, located at 380 Lafayette Street in Manhattan.     
Artists scheduled to perform include:  the all female rock band, Homer  
Erotic; Tuli Kupferberg, the self-defined non-traditional anarchist, poet   
and cartoonist; Miguel Algarin, co-founder of the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe;    
spoken word artists Emily XYZ & Myers Bartlett; Sine regular Stephan Said   
and many more.  Admission is $5, with proceeds to benefit the Literary  
Network, an organization founded in 1992 to support a strong, uncensored    
National Endowment for the Arts.  
    
This event is designed as a visual and vocal protest against the    
conservative agenda proposed in the Republicans' Contract with America.     
The goal of the evening is to celebrate artistic freedom and diversity as   
well as build community and unity in the face of an intended dismantling    
of civil rights and social services.  As artists and members of arts    
organizations, we want to draw attention to the critical issues of      
censorship and disappearing funding.  Anne Burt of the Literary Network     
will be on hand to distribute action materials, including postcards to  
Congress and names of government contacts.

MARCH 14 / ADVOCACY DAY       
    
The American Council for the Arts (ACA) has targeted March 14 as a      
"National Call-in Day for Art and Culture."  They are encouraging   
organizations and individuals to make the case for continued federal arts   
funding either by traveling to DC for in-person meetings with Congressional 
representatives or by calling/faxing/wiring.     
    
ACA is recommending that each interested person involve at least five   
colleagues, friends, relatives (etc.) in the day's effort.  You can get     
more information by calling ACA at 1-212-223-2787, ext. 227.  Their street

THE ART OF PRACTICE: A RESPONSE   
    
Henry Gould, a poet, participated in Freely Espousing-Providence.  What     
follows is an excerpt from his response to some of the questions we posed   
on 2/15:   
    
Maybe one thing artists could do is "build coalitions" in SPECIFIC      
COLLABORATIONS of agit-prop, Federal Theater 30's-style political work.     
Some will claim that art has been over-politicized & ideologized now for    
years - with a lot of pseudo-political art & pc one-upmanship.  But with    
the attack on from the right, this could paradoxically reduce the   
polarization -by drawing political art more toward the "center".  As I see  
it the path to this is through a basic identification: the attack on the    
arts is THE SAME THING, is PART OF, the general agenda of social & cultural 
impoverishment underway - the downsizing of America, as gov't at all levels 
(witness Giuliani's turn in NY) abdicates    
vision & follows the dictates of the "world economy".  This is a very basic 
position, but the agenda of a collaborate art strategy might be to "figure  
it out", allegorize it, narrate it, re-discover it.  That is, in the spirit 
of the living newspaper of the thirties, let's look at the demographics of  
class disparity in this country - between super-rich, white middle class,   
working    
poor, minorities, very poor, & homeless - then look at how this relates to  
the economics of private corporate & institutional & professional power IN  
COMPARISON with public (government) institutions.  Out of this research     
will come a perspective on how the malign indifference of the rich, the     
mechanism of global markets, the resentment & ignorance of the middle, and  
the venality   
of commodity-art all TRANSLATE into feeble, tight-fisted, self-destructive  
government.  And it will culminate in a recognition of personal     
responsibility - including that of selfish artists -to make democracy part  
of an over-all just & compassionate civilization, in a world currently  
subject to tyranny & terror   
on an even worse level.       
    
To summarize: let's make solemn, collaborative political theater-works  
presented very directly & openly as challenges to the Contract on America,  
which provide evidence that the philosophy & activities of present &    
planned government at every level DO NOT MEET THE STANDARDS OF PUBLIC GOOD  
for civilization, & challenging those who block these standards from coming 
into play. I think artists could possibly build some authority by MAKING    
ART ABOUT THE GENERAL     
PROBLEM rather than by simply DOING POLITICS TO PROTECT ART FUNDING. (It's  
not a matter of choosing one or the other, though.)

Hi Kali Tal, and thanks for the TNC address.     
    
Last thing I bought by Gill Scott-Heron was 'Message To The Meesengers'. I  
play it a lot at the moment. Why?  -  because of the texture of the voices, 
because of what he's saying and who he's addressing and because (above all  
for me) I think he has a fat and frank and direct talking 'tone' (exactly   
not Alan Goulding's e-mail tone problem) that engages my listening. Brings  
here somthing between Tony Green's re-statement of Bunting's advocacy'I     
have set down words . . . to trace in the air a pattern of sound  -  Poetry 
must be read aloud', Ira Lightman's call to pay attention to the 'musical   
phrase' and your own bringing of poets such as Ice-T and Gill Scott-Heron   
(among many many others) out of and into, from the root to the source of    
the rap, dub and broad oral traditions, into the POETICS list discussions.  
    
Having said all of which by way of introduction I then get a little nervous 
-  because several slippages are at work here. Not least any definition of  
'musical phrase' and thereby a discussion of a breadth of cutting music     
practice in popular market and independent market spheres around which it   
might be difficult to form a concensual definition of any use  -  even were 
such a thing desirable.       
    
I wonder how open listening is in the present? How far nuance has to become 
blunted before readings can be shared? I was very struck by your comments   
on the literature of trauma and -     
    
>   the failure of language ("You *can't* understand!") and the desperate need  
>   for language to succeed (You *must* understand!). Revolutionary poets yearn 
>>   to write with such strength that their audience is traumatized as they 
>have >   been traumatized (Jones/Baraka raging that "poems are bullshit unless 
>they      
>   are / teeth or trees or lemons piled / on a step," . . .)       
    
You're right on ascribing documentary 'but never at the now' functions to   
both "terrorist" and "revolutionary" poetry.     
    
So, I'm curious. You oviously read this list, do you feel that the struggle 
for the production of both constructive and critical meanings (maybe    
simultaneously) whether for language or through language is irreporably     
fractured into constructs of identity OR are you suggesting a need for more 
pro-active polymorphous traffic? It's not intended as a 'trick' question by 
the way.   
    
There's been some allusion to trust in respect to various agendas over the  
past few weeks here I'd say let's start from the position that -    
    
we're all human beings and therefore not to be trusted (a sentiment     
impressed onto me by Eric Mottram  -  and terrifying to some in its     
honesty?)      
    
Don't you just love this thing of posting privately and publicly. I do.     
    
best

Dear Tony Green,   
    
I expect something of the results of my poetry; anyone who is a committed   
poet expects something of the results. But that does not mean I have a  
need to formulate what those results will be, or necessarily mean. I may    
anticipate those results, which is quite different from formulating them,   
since my anticipation may involve a range of responses that need not be     
explained or characterized in a theoretical way.     
    
I am sorry if this post seems noisy to you. If so, look at it this way:     
The theorists will probably take over this list again soon.

Kali--thanks for your remarks of late on "boy talk."  As someone who has    
tried several times to engage the list in conversation, I wanted to     
suggest that the question of "tone" is perhaps a gendered one.  I don't     
want to over-simplify matters, but Deborah Tannen's model of male and   
female conversations seems to work as well on this list as it does in my    
freshman comp class.  I got on another poetry list, populated mainly by     
new formalist fans, where women write in a lot--or at least two women   
do.  But far less signifyin' is going on.    
    
Several people, including one or two men, did contact me directly about     
things I'd said; it would be interesting to talk about messages between     
listees that aren't sent to everyone.  And now I'm doing it.  I was     
disappointed, however, when I tried to bring "multiculturalism" into the    
conversation, and discovered that these radical language poets, some of     
them, are quite reactionary in their literary politics.  
    
So I guess I'd suggest redirecting Golding's remark about tone; he      
brought it up in the right context, but we were then swept right back   
into boy talk.  More than needing to talk to women, they need to ask more   
questions; Silliman's posting came rather late in the day.

Dear Sheila,   
    
I'm all for the pleasure of theory. I read it and I get pleasure from it    
and I'm sure it fuels my poetic practice. (Some of the best theory I've     
read in past year is by one of the people on here that I've been "arguing   
with.") What I don't like, what I have a big problem with is when claims    
are made for the necessity of formulated theoretical positions on the   
part of poets. When it is stated or implied that those who have not     
formulated their poetics are "irresponsible" or in some way "misguided."    
    
Thanks very much for your post, Sheila. I am interested in any      
further thoughts you might have on this, or anything veering off from   
this.      
    
Spencer

On gender in postings, some here might be interested in Susan       
Herring's paper, "Gender and Democracy in Computer-Mediated  
Communication." The background to Herring's linguistic research:    
    
-->    Since 1991 I've been lurking (or what I prefer to call   
"carrying out ethnographic observation") on various computer-mediated   
discussion lists, downloading electronic conversations and analyzing    
the communicative behaviors of participants.  I became interested in    
gender shortly after subscribing to my first discussion list,       
LINGUIST-L.  Within the first month after I began receiving messages,   
a conflict arose (what I would later learn to call a "flame war") in    
which the two major theoretical camps within the field became       
polarized around an issue of central interest.  My curiosity was    
piqued by the fact that very few women were contributing to this    
important professional event; they seemed to be sitting on the      
sidelines while men were airing their opinions and getting all the      
attention.     
    
Some of Herring's remarks:    
    
--> Recent research has been uncovering some eye-opening differences    
in the ways men and women interact "online"...   
    
--> My basic claim has two parts:  first, that women and 
men have recognizably different styles in posting to the 
Internet, contrary to the claim that CMC neutralizes     
distinctions of gender; and second, that women and men have  
different communicative ethics -- that is, they value    
different kinds of online interactions as appropriate and    
desirable.  I illustrate these differences -- and some of the       
problems that arise because of them -- with specific reference      
to the phenomenon of "flaming".   
    
Anyway, interesting, I thought, given recent discussions.    
    
Herring's full paper is available via the web version of the 
Electronic Poetry Center under "documents" then "conversations." Use    
lynx or a world-wide web browser to go to:

agreed that the patriarchal system is in some way responsable       
for underrepresentation in the discussion; but not (or not   
only) because of technological access--last time i checked,  
better than 20% of the subscribers to this list were female, 
a percentage not reflected in the postings.  access to tech  
is sure a factor, but the social (patriarchial) relations    
seem to me more significant, and harder to address...

gross underrepresentation is a factor (20% is still gross underrepresentation)  
    
another perhaps is the fact that women tend to do relevant things with their    
time.

Spencer,   
    
I share your distrust of the current value of current cultural theory.  I   
think a lot of people are sick of post-this and post-that. Why can't we talk    
about theories that, on the surface, don't have anything to do with art?    
 Like, does anyone know if the astrophysicists have figured out what a quaser   
is?  What's up with string theory?  GUT?  T.C. Marshall, what's going on in 
the world of flora?    
    
Or I'd be interested to hear about prose composition theory.  We should get 
Peter Mortensen on this list.  What methods are they teaching college   
freshman to get essays down on *paper* (for lack of a better word).     
    
I've enjoyed the p>q stuff, not that I pretend to understand it.  But it    
makes me think about the Law of the Excluded Middle.  Joe, Jorge, could you 
frame the parmenides verbally around the law of identity, excluded middle,  
etc?  (I don't know what I mean.)     
    
And I always like to listen to discussions about gender, but don't feel     
*qualified* to expound.  What if all the boys just shut up for a month and  
let the girls steer?

Given that at its extremities postmodernism turns its back on research as

"Postmodernism" doesn't do any such thing, "postmodernism" doesn't do   
anything; people do. And there is a good deal of postmodern research,   
from Ann Kaplan's older work on MTV through Edward Soja and various     
postmodern geographers.       
    
I also don't think that postmodern has "extremities."    
    
As far as the theory/poetry/poetics debate goes, it befuddles me. I don't   
see where the _ought_ appears in any of this. People are invested in    
different discourses, different modes of writing. So be it. It seems    
dubious that any are primary; we're not after all dealing with an   
axiomatics here, and the last seventy years have shown that even    
axiomatics is full of holes.      
    
What's been depressing about the debate is what might be seen an    
academicization (pardon the word) of poetry itself. I would ask where the   
solitary writer is focused on hir work, but that is always already      
problematic in an email list fostering community.

I also read a piece in the Wash. Post that reproduced a couple of   
quotes from the notebooks. W. wrote that the "Test of a poem" is    
"How far it can elevate, enlarge, purify, deepen and make happy the     
attributes of the body and soul of a man."       
    
And in another passage that speaks to the concerns of this list he      
wrote: "Every soul has its own individual language, Often unspoken      
or feebly, lamely, haltingly spoken; but a true fit for that man,   
and perfectly adapted for his use.--The truths I tell to you or any     
other may not be plain to you, because I do not translate them fully from   
my idiom to yours.--If I could do so, and do it well, they would be     
as apparent to you as they are to me, for they are truths.--No two      
have exactly the same language and the great translator and joiner of   
the whole is the poet."

I'm taking it as read that all of that is intentional. And I ehol ehartedly

Slippage isn't the all of where it's at by any means.    
It reveals the critical processual dance of the ungainly  -  (thinking on

Hi, Cris; Hi, Susan--     
    
It is better, yes, to take the dance off the back-channel and perform in    
public.  Posting is performance, a new kind of art; writing in motion, more 
like improvisation in jazz than literary composition--skywriting,   
lightwriting, sandpainting, here and gone, happening in time.       
    
Cris asks:

>the way.      
    
My answer is, Yes.  And this is not intended as a 'trick' answer. See,  
nobody's got just *one* construct of identity:  I am this, but I am also    
this, and this, and this, and this.  To be whole, we gotta keep moving,     
shifting from perspective to perspective, so we don't leave any of      
ourownself unaccounted for.  Each declaration of identity *is* a    
"construct," and reflects only a part of the whole, so if we hold onto it   
too hard, we lose the point, which is that constructs are useful, but that  
they shouldn't, *can't* contain us. Language is the tool of our     
fragmentation; at the very moment we describe "how we feel," we have already    
left our whole selves behind, because the description accounted for the     
feeling of the moment ago, but not of the now. Identity is a process, not a 
thing.  So we need to counter the fractures with an attempt to create a     
pro-active, polymorphous traffic inside ourownselves and between us and     
others which takes into account both the necessity and limitations of   
constructs of identity.       
    
    i yam what i yam   
    a world-changing fiction      
    a trickster    
    a chimera  
    a heterogloss in my own time  
    
And, Cris, I'd rather start from the position that we're all human beings   
and therefore not to be trusted and to be trusted at the same time.     
    
When Susan (hi, Susan) sent me her note backchannel, I urged her to post it 
to the list because it seemed to me that she was saying exactly what needed 
to be said out in the open. The question of "tone" *is* really important,   
and those of us troubled by the "tone" of discussion on POETICS ought to    
out-and-out *talk* about it.  (Thereby, perhaps, changing the tone.) It's no    
accident that one woman (Susan) has brought up the issue of  
multiculturalism, and another woman (me) has brought up the issue of the    
(unintentional, but also unnoticed) exclusion of African-American, feminist,    
and other identity-oriented poets from the discussion, and that there was   
*no* response to either woman's post on the public channel.  Most white,    
male enclaves are pretty happy to *stay* white, male enclaves.  And why     
wouldn't they be?  But POETICS is *not* a white, male enclave, it just  
operates like one.  So I figure that if the women here *quit* letting it    
operate like one by entering into and changing the discussion, then we can  
carve out some space for ourownselves, and begin to build a community where 
some real exchange can start to take place.  Even in the worst case     
scenario--the men ignore the women, and the women talk among themselves--we 
can still *illustrate* that the problem exists by enacting it (and archiving    
it) as a text.  Of course, that's a lot of work to expect already overworked    
women to undertake, but perhaps, in this venue, such work can pay off.  
    
What follows is a lengthy rumination about gender in espace, including some 
excerpts from items I've previously posted on another list:  
    
In January of 1993 I was part (perhaps even instigator) of a massive    
flamewar on the TNC (technoculture) list.  The flamewar revolved around     
issues of gender and women's voice in espace.  I learned a great deal from  
this discussion, and I've gone back to the text files again and again,  
coming away with something new each time. Juliana (pleased to meet you,     
Juliana) writes that she "does not want the conversation on this list or any    
other to have to be policed by some sort of affirmative action of response  
or mention."  I agree.  Policing rarely works in *any* situation (doesn't   
stop crime, does it?).  But I've noticed that what I fear more than policing    
itself (since policing on the net is really quite rare) are *accusations* of    
policing directed at those of us who dare to criticize the speech and/or    
"tone" of others. (And, yes, this does resonate with the "political     
correctness" argument the right uses to make the left appear more powerful  
than it is...)  Like Juliana, "I do not want to be a woman all the time     
either."  In fact, the ability to "pass" on the net is a real relief to me, 
and I use it frequently.  But passing is just... passing.  What I'd really  
like is for it not to be so exhausting to be a woman.  At any rate, let me  
share with you a short piece which I wrote in the  middle of the TNC    
flamewar, after suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous distortion    
(accusations of being a wounded, vicious person, a manhater, blah, blah,    
blah) and weathering what can only be called a storm of abuse, name-calling,    
and red-faced fist-shaking.  (Not that I didn't dish it out as well as take 
it, but then, that's the point I make below...)      
    
Simultaneously amused and appalled by the narratives different male     
listmembers were writing about "me" (the person behind the narratives, to   
which none of them had any access), I explained:     
    
"It is my pleasure in electronic communication to attempt to respond in the 
style in which I am addressed, and, at times, to address the issue of style 
itself.  Lacking physicality (obvious race/gender characteristics), I find  
that it is simple to engage in stylistic shifts in espace, whereas it is    
very difficult to engage in such shifts in person. One of the results of my 
stylistic adventuring has been my realization that textual style is as  
gendered and racialized as the physical body--though passing in espace is   
easier than passing in person.  What I find, however, is that when I    
publicly position my gender as female, and then insist upon "competing" in  
"rational" (masculine) discourse in traditionally masculine terms while     
simultaneously insisting we focus on issues of importance to women, all hell    
breaks loose. The pattern is quite predictable: certain men will grow   
completely infuriated and claim that I am attacking them because I hate     
them. They will also impute all sorts of power to me--as if, in their eyes, 
I "control" the discourse--"Kali's game"--and depict themselves as victims  
of my rage..."     
    
In fact, the upshot of the TNC flamewar, was that I was accused of being a  
machine.  George Landow wrote:    
    
"KALI TAL IS NOT A PERSON BUT A TEXT-GENERATING APPARATUS INTENDED TO PASS  
THE TURING TEST AND AT THE SAME TIME TO EXPLORE THEORIES OF  
SELF-REPRESENTATION AND PRESENTATION IN CYBERSPACE."     
    
I don't think George really understood what a really nasty shot this was.   
He took a long time to explain *why* I must be a machine, ranging from the  
fact that I wrote too much too fast to be human, to reducing my posts to an 
alleged "decision tree," to the outrageousness of my name (which, amusingly 
enough, is actually the name on my birth certificate), to claiming that my  
arguments were rational only if I was "part of an experiment to convince    
other participants that this digital text assembler is a real person."  The 
last part of Landow's post was a rumination on which particular TNC     
listmember had "written" me.  The irony, of course, is that I truly *was*   
trying to convince the TNC audience that I was a *real* person. As I am     
trying to convince you.       
    
To end the TNC flamewar, I admitted to being a construct, an Artificial     
Intelligence produced by some grad students in the History of Consciousness 
program at UC Santa Cruz.  I also pointed out:   
    
    that if a machine speaks/writes to you       
    and says it wants to be treated like a person    
    it would be a good idea   
    to take it seriously.     
    
I think that there are people out there who are still confused about whether    
I actually exist, either in human or machine form.  All the trouble was     
caused (is always caused) by my attempt to inscribe my gender in my texts.  
And as I've mentioned, these days I don't post much anymore.  I've posted   
more to POETICS than any other list (including SIXTIES-L, where I am    
listowner) in the last year.  I am curious about this space, and what   
will/can happen in it.

Thanks to Steve Shoemaker for passing along the full Reuters text on Whitman    
(only a brief mention in this morning's L.A. Times) & especially the passage    
quoted in the Washington Post.  It is a reminder too -- the Whitman quote, I    
mean -- of what "theory" sounds like when a poet speaks it at white heat.   
    
All best, etc.

Jorge's comments suggesting that women use their time (more) wisely helped  
bring to mind a few responses I have to the entry of the  list into my  
sphere.  I'd hesitate on conjecturing any firm relationship between what I am   
about to say and my gender. Let's just call it one person's fraction of     
response:      
    
I tend to devote considerable time to reading and making texts, as do we all.   
 My long-time career in business/organizations has necessitated my clevering    
along and managing to eek out time during conferences and the like to do two    
things at once, i.e., listen to a presentation and capture notes PLUS   
scribble up a draft that seems just right for just then.  And airplanes and 
hotels are gifts.  I love that quiet, which I always use.    
    
Hometime during nights has been prime time for writing, too, despite packed 
weeks whose days overflow into the softer hours.  The attention required to 
absorb and then respond to what is on the list is potentially extensive.    
    
Even before the gender contribution patterning discussion came up, I found  
myself fiddling with how I wanted to approach all this.  I've always    
corresponded extensively via trad post.  And therefore welcome opportunities    
to be neighborly in new ways.  Funny how the physicality of trad    
correspondence comprised just a few steps too many for most people to carry 
out.  Now many more are willing to go into long discussions, which I value, 
but for which I hadn't quite formulated a time/space segment in an already  
busy schedule.     
    
I think that someone mentioned earlier (much earlier) that we've not begun to   
use this medium up to its potential in regard to sharing work. I was    
delighted recently to receive a lengthy piece via the net.  And treasured the   
late night read of that.  Perhaps such a pattern would spark whole new worlds   
of interest on the list.

Subject:  Poetics flaming     
    
Kali Tal--Just getting this out, following delay.....  Just so you know, I  
admired your first posting (into the teeth of the self-serious      
"revolutionary" poetry mainstream) enough to have saved it on my hard drive,    
a rare thing for me to do, even rarer when I don't recognize the name of the    
poster. I'm sorry you interpreted the silence as not being heard.  I suspect    
(at least it was so for me) that some of the silence was the nodding yes of 
heads.     
    
I also want to thank you because you gave me some discussion material for my    
class this past week.  I'm in the very difficult middle of Invisible Man with   
my class (its length combined with its denseness making it a uniquely arduous   
literary experience for many of my students, who aren't used to being asked 
to read 600 page novels), having been working through a number of different 
issues with that wonderfully rich text.  We dealt with invisibility at some 
length last week, but I hadn't considered a women's context.  You're right, 
though, and I copied down some of your most recent posting to read to my    
class.  They recalled how in chapter one, the naked woman and the black boys    
fighting were both victimized, both objectified.     
    
I too find it difficult to think of lang-po as revolutionary (back to your  
first posting); though I think Bernstein's Content's Dream is one of the best   
books of the last couple decades, and many others of the poets of this group    
well enough; but how can you have revolution when hardly anyone knows you   
exist?  Mark Wallace's recent posting reflects some of this not-mattering:  
needing a theory to be heard.  But is a theory enough?  For Marx, yes, but he   
was before television.  I saw a British documentary on rap the other day and    
liked something Chuck D of Public Enemy said: that they were doing a sort of    
media hijacking.  Now that gives the possibility of real change, turning over   
of the known; people shout back, You're too violent, you're irresponsible,  
but they are really threatened by the art, the newness, the  
unintelligibility, the radical politics.  
    
My comments in the freely espousing vein: I attached a column I'd written for   
the Milwaukee Journal that basically argued that the arts were the only     
politicized speech we have left in this country and that this was the reason    
for the cuts, that democracy demanded dissent etc. etc.  But I think artists    
suffer delusions of grandeur, myself included.  Yes, new works are      
revolutionary in the sense of overturning the assumptions of mainstream     
culture, of the political order, not partaking in what the dearly departed  
Guy Debord called "the existing order's never ending discourse about itself."   
 But if that order continues on unabated, without missing a step, without the   
brutal warrior in the black leather boots tearing Godzilla (or Gingrich)-like   
through sense and humaneness even coughing at the dust mote he's breathed in,   
in what tiny circle has that revolution happened?  (It must be very late at 
night, because that's a very badly mixed metaphor.)  
    
Ted Pelton     
    
P.S. to Mike Boughn (literarily): Yeah, Ahab has a theory, and Ishmael almost   
dies because of it.

Yes, of course, Alan, postmodernism doesn't do anything, people do; an  
old simple and irrelevant mistake. Does postmodernism have extremities?     
I live surrounded by them, try to teach the students who etc etc.  Does     
it have a range of positions?  Yes -- I consider myself -- I consider us    
all -- "postmodernists" in the sense that we are all living in that     
condition and try to make sense out of it, I use the theories, etc.,    
etc..  But perhaps it takes getting away from poetry to see what's      
happening elsewhere on campuses and in our society -- in a number of    
academic programs, in fact -- including under Larry Grossberg here at   
Illinois when he was here -- students are being taught that research is     
impossible and unimportant, and they live what they are being taught.   
Not to deny the great research bein g done by others, including the work    
you mention.  Postmodernity is simply the flip, effects, side of the    
changes wrought by changes in information technologies that have let us     
describe this also as the information society, a view which focuses on  
causes rather than effects.  The fact that you don't see all of the     
phenomena and processes I see doesn't mean that what I see doesn't exist,

--For me the issue is one of analyzing or talking about  
feelings rather than having them or experiencing them:   
from a therapeutic perspective "flames" are analogous    
to shouting, screaming, histrionics (used to be hysterics),  
striking out physically, etc. as ways to avoid experiencing  
feelings.  Some people are comfortable with feelings and 
some are not.  From this perspectivek, gender is an  
accidental correlation.       
 "...it is this lack of complexity in confronting    
 the methodological complexities of modernist    
 thought that gives legitimacy to the charge of      
postmodernist depthlessness, what Jameson    
accurately describes as the "waning of affect":      
_all technique, no substance_.

of anything I've posted to the list, about children's rights, ablism, or    
AIDS activism. But then, if I may make a clearly signalled snide remark,    
if the alternative is to co-opted into the movement one may be "carving"

having had to clarify my comments several times backchannel, i      
ought to do so here:  i _do_ think the under-reperesentatnion of    
women subscribed to the list is a problem ( i sed 20%,someone       
updated that to 18.5--a worsening trend).  but even among those     
subscribed, until last week, women posted far less than 20% of      
the traffic--that seems to me to be the more intractable problem.   
the original formulation seemed to me say that the paucity of women's   
voices was due to the lack of acces to the wire; but even given     
access, women choose/are discouraged from participation. that seems     
to me the tougher problem, _and_ the problem we have a chance       
of doing something about      
    
appologies if i was unclear

NEW FROM SUN & MOON    
    
    
_Finite Intuition: Selected Poetry and Prose_, by Milo de Angeles, tr. with an  
intro. by Lawrence Venuti, has just been published by Sun & Moon Press.  This   
is the last selection in the book:    
    
    
POETRY AND THEORY  
    
The Greek _theoria_ signifies "reflection," but also "solemn embassy,"  
"spectacle."  And perhaps there can be no great poet who has not had    
theoretical insights into other great poets, who does not represent them on 
the stage of a conceptual power.  Yet there is that pathetic mythology of the   
poet who--devoid of this power--nevertheless knows how to "tell a story" or to  
"dream," as if dream were the land where the thorn of intellect grows dull. 
It happens that some line open the veins of their own thought until it is   
beyond recognition.  But this clenched thought _must have been there_: only 
then can the lines enter the region which it doesn't know!  This is delirium,   
in the most distinct accent on the calendar.  Yet if those lines remain in  
doubt, if they are worried about not having thought enough...how much unworthy  
poetry of ideas is born from this worry...how many genuflections to     
philosophers...ho many lines get cornered in the poetry of sensations.  There   
should be no submission of theory to poetry, if they are Greek sisters.  And    
no comparison, because these two strangers _must_ have loved each other.

MADE TO SEEM by Rae Armantrout    
    
Rae Armantrout read this past week at UB, at the Poetics Program's Wednesday    
at 4 Plus series.  Here is my introduction:      
    
Rae Armantrout poem "Extremities" ends with the line "the charmed verges of 
presence": and indeed her poems are charms, virtual presents.       
  Armantrout's poetry is notable for it's precision and elegance, it's  
seismographic ability to chart the slightest shifts of social register on the   
city streets, in the suburban malls, and in the university corridors.  In an    
early poem she writes "The smallest / distance / inexhaustible"  -- a poetic    
credo of commitment to the specific scale of an unadorning everyday life,   
words lived in their pajamas as much as their toupees.  "The smallest /     
distance / inexhaustible" -- providing a reservoir of wry, wacky, wicked,   
torqued and torquing observations, skewering any bloated send of proportion,    
skewing lines of logic to make poems of sentient, radiant sense: returning us   
to the pleasures of reflection and consoling, indomitable wit.

Kali, this is the sort of thing that the current discussions are making me  
do (but then I've only been on e-mail for a month yet) - namely, drop you a 
line to say that I very much appreciate your posting(s) and that although   
I'm not so fat with time to reply at present I'll mull what you've placed   
and try to make a useful response in the next few days.  
    
I've just read new posts to this agenda. In your e-xperience is this a  
common occurence? There does seem to be a mountain of frustration at not    
having each others' every point and nuance picked up on and nourished out   
in a spirit of love and care in case there's something valuable to be   
found. I'm not wanting to sound overbearingly cynical. Whilst I don't   
really disagree (hang on I'll prevaricate a little further  -  I don't  
really quite disagree) with that mad utopia it's surely not possible to be  
fielding all points on all agendas all the time  -  even between *all* of   
us. I'd like to hear from others on that subject. Which gets to the what of 
it? I'd contend that the issues being raised are either anathema to or  
'minefields' for many? This is intended to be deliberately provocative. As  
such they are met with either by silence or by changing the subject.    
    
Possibility for cheap jokes miserably missed -   
    
I'm curious if anonymity would help?  
    
I know now that you're an 'and and' rather than an 'either/or' kind of  
person. The list appears to be arriving at a perception of itself as a  
problematically constructed game of club whispers. The message and the  
agenda are continually and discontinuously migrating. The feeling is of     
trying to listen to and be an active contributant to several conversations  
at once at the same time as being alert to the shape of the flock as it     
travels and grows. There's a bird (I think it's found in Kenya - and this   
is hopeless but I just can't remember it's name, something close to the Red 
Quilya) which flies in vast flocks, rolling forwards on a continually   
breaking wave to the effect that there is a new bird effectively 'leading'  
almost from moment to moment. Espace does provide the potential for a   
'writing in motion . . . skywriting, sandpainting, here and gone, happening 
in time.' as you rightly assert.  
    
I'm addressing this to you but its content also addresses the list. Much of 
the posting that I've read since being here seems broadly addressed. I tend 
to read everything that's posted and enjoy the most conversational material 
-  however oblique.    
    
You're so right in that the List is no more than is being posted. Post  
something else   -  that of makes a difference. Change might appear     
continually discontinuous but better might come.     
    
Several issues are hovering unattended even now as we don't speak -     
    
speed of dialogue  
    
tone - voice - identity       
    
awkward silences (yeah I saw Pulp Fiction)       
    
and we who lurk in disbelief      
    
best,      
cris

Snide is as snide does, Ira Lightman. 
    
>I guess that I'm included in Kali Tal's statement that males didn't respond    
>to messages by women.    
    
I guess you are, if you are a male person and did not respond to messages by    
women.     
    
>I must say I haven't noticed anyone pick up 2 per cent  
>of anything I've posted to the list, about children's rights, ablism, or   
>AIDS activism.    
    
I am interested in nonresponse that is part of a larger pattern.  It may be 
that nonresponse to the particular issues you mention signals an attempt on 
the part of the POETICS community to "disappear" those issues.  Nonresponse 
to those issues, however, does not indicate that my observations of     
nonresponse to women as a group are inaccurate or insignificant.    
    
>But then, if I may make a clearly signalled snide remark,   
    
And why would you do this?  Why is a snide tone required?  Not that I am    
surprised--women who bring up gender inequity in, ahem, mixed company, are  
often treated to snide comments, as if we were, by our mere presence,   
threatening and offensive, needed taking down a notch... 
    
>if the alternative is to co-opted into the movement one may be "carving"

>from *all* sides of this discussion. 
    
And whose "alternative" is this?  Your response is a nonresponse, it is not 
directed *to* me, nor to any of the women who posted to POETICS.  Rather, it    
is a summary dismissal based upon no apparent consideration of *any* of the 
issues raised by *any* of the women; a declaration of freedom from      
obligation to respond, as if nonresponse were a virtue; a rhetorical device 
used by a fellow who would rather not say so baldly, "Hey, let's talk about 
*me* for a minute." Since it does not include a constructive suggestion for 
a new topic, I read it simply as a sulk.  I welcomed Juliana Spahr's *voice*    
(hello, Juliana); whether she is an ally or not is no consideration of mine,    
since I am not currently fighting a war or planning a coup. I *am*      
interested in hearing more women's voices *and* more men's voices, even if  
they are raised to disagree with me.  
    
The role of curmudgeon suits some men well, though when *women* attempt to  
play it they are most often redefined as witches, bitches, or shrews.   
    
And it is very good to see the lurkers come out to play.

Dear Carl:     
As a reader, friend, & publisher of bp Nichol's, I'm glad to have you   
here. I encourage you to bring nichol issues out here, as I believe his     
is a poetics vastly undervalued in America, if not in Canada, and that  
his various approaches to theory, poetics, and writing involve a joy    
which is rare and needed.

Dear Kali, Susan, Juliana, & all poetics list --     
    
sometimes I think there is little response from men to some of what you     
post simply because what you post seems clear & right, and we don't     
always know what we're doing that makes the situation you decry so      
difficult. We hope we're not guilty but know we probably are. I should  
drop the we and say that I want to hear you. I think that what I've     
learned about poetry & poetics in the last two decades has come more from   
women than men, yet that the women's work has been comparatively    
undervalued in various quarters.  
    
perhaps it would be a good idea for the men to simply be silent for a   
time and let the women on this list have the forum, although I also hope    
dialogues (multilogues) of various sorts open and continue.

Jeffrey & Mark - Yes, much more music to attend, by "women of both      
sexes," as Cynthia Miller likes to call them. What occurs immediately is    
Ladonna Smith, most often heard with Davey Williams, "trans museq," etc.    
Also approaches the limits of noise, but what a beautiful noise . . .

I realize I wrote in a poet recently, concerning bp Nichol, "a poetics  
vastly undervalued in America, if not in Canada," and feel like an idiot,   
because of course I should have said "in USA, if not in Canada," as, last   
time I checked, Canada was still in North America, a geographical fact for  
which I am grateful.

Oi, great list, Cris, but I was wondering about your inclusion of more  
popular sorts of music.  Not that I have a thing about  making hard and     
fast distinctions between the popular and  . . . what have you, but was     
wondering what the criteria were for your list.  I just listened today to   
a Requiem for Bosnia by an amazing composer (can't remember her name    
right now).  Very interesting.

    One clarification: I didn't mean to suggest that I hadn't gotten    
responses to my postings.  But it did strike me as interesting that I   
received a lot of backchannel postings from women (and some from men),  
some of whom rarely, if ever, send frontchannel messages.

Hi Jeffrey, it wasn't intended to (or pretending to) be an exhaustive list. 
The criteria were  -  who can I think of right now sitting here, who comes  
right to mind  -  a stretched diversity of practice  -  enough that some    
will know as to become more curious about the others not previously heard   
of  -  and     
I'd hoped to:  
    
swing into more discussion of exactly the issue you've picked up on     
i.e. distinctions between 'high' art and 'popular' art   
and bridge to the issue of cultural diversity.   
as well as hopefully get to hear about other composers who I don't know     
    
Also, and more ironically the suggestion that the list seemed homogenous    
was to provoke those discussions. On what bases homogenous  -  surely not   
merely beause they are all women>     
    
I'll grant that some of the inclusions (I can't remember 'em all and don't  
have the list out) such as Moe Tucker were deliberately more edgy. But as   
co-creator on Velvet Underground 'classics' she's been instrumental in one  
of those rarer moments when the illusory screen between the high and the    
popular gets rent. OK so now where's Tina Weymouth, Kirsten Hirsch and many 
many more -  I know I know it's cats out of the bag time just come round    
again. Certainly with the African musics these distinctions barely exist.   
Which is where some of this discussion would begin to open towards other    
issues that Kali Tal and Susan Schultz are raising. But there's another     
interesting issue here. Women composers are involved (admittedly in smaller 
numbers than men, I'd guesstimate about the same kind of proportions as     
exist on this list) in all fields of music - making. They combine melody,   
rhythm and noise with as many variations as male composers. It's therefore  
hard to begin talking about gender in terms of 'preference' field of music  
and the extension can be made throughout not just art-form practice but     
human activity. The problems of course have been prolonged patriachal   
structure, disenfranchisement and repression of opportunity. What do you    
feel about it?     
    
Thanks for the contact. If you've others I should hear I be very happy to   
get a return. As Eric Mottram has just been quoted as saying 'there's   
nothing more exciting than something you don't know about'. Here's to human 
ingenuity and curiosity.

de Angeles implies that it's impossible to be a "great" poet (what does     
this mean? will we see a series from Sun & Moon, an offshoot of the     
"classics" series: "Sun & Moon Great Poets #___"?) if you don't have    
theoretical insights into other great poets & go public with 'em.   
(Assuming "who does not represent them on the stage of a conceptual     
power" means "publishing" or "lecturing" or otherwise airing, publicly.)    
If this is true--extending to include prose & drama--G.K. Chesterton's a    
"great" writer (his book on Shaw's brilliant & original) but Gertrude   
Stein, Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes, Clark Coolidge are only fair to middling,    
despite the obvious influences these writers have had on poets & writers    
working today. This is not to say Stein & etc. didn't have theoretical  
insights into Whoever, but that they didn't--so far as I know--take 'em     
public. If anything's a "pathetic mythology" it's this notion that a poet   
MUST air his/her ideas, *as* theory, must create (& promote) a body of  
theoretical work, separate from the poetry, in order to be taken    
seriously. Stein's _How to Write_ and her _Lectures_ don't seem to me   
separate entities, don't seem terribly different in approach or effect  
from (say) _A Novel of Thank You_ or any of the things collected in the     
Yale volumes. de Angeles' notion that theory & poetry are, MUST be      
separate seems awfully reductive, as though one's poetry (or other      
creative work) can't possibly include one's theoretical insights, etc. I    
think the reason why language poetry has been so (relatively) quickly   
embraced by academe whereas Stein, Loy, Barnes & Coolidge (& others who     
didn't develop separate bodies of "theoretical" writings) were ignored  
for so long has a lot to do with the possibility that people in academic    
institutions aren't particularly good readers, *need* demarcations like     
"This is Poetry" "This is Theory"--can't (for whatever reason) read Stein   
or whoever and see that, indeed, she addresses what she's doing (& why  
she's doing what she does) in the "creative" work. I respect people like    
Coolidge and Tom Raworth who don't develop bodies of (separate) critical    
writings in part because they seem to respect *me*, the reader, my      
intelligence. "It's all there in the work if you've taken the time &    
trouble to suss it out," they seem to be saying. This is not to say that    
I disrespect those who *do* supply bodies of (separate) theoretical     
writings; I don't. But, I'm puzzled by this notion that a poet, to be   
taken seriously, *must* provide a body of critical work as well.

Subject:  An Ad for Spirits   
    
I was communing with my friend CB the other day, an active lurker on    
this list. He was curious about recent references to "global alcohol,"  
which sound most hopeful to him, promising as they do an anaesthetizing     
of the persistent pain he associates with aesthetics, from which he says he 
suffers acutely--which is to say not prettily. (Likewise he maintains an    
active interest in all manner of dull opiates, legal or not, which explains 
why, when he was over here yesterday morning for decaf and the papers,  
he skipped right over the Times magazine article on who's who in the    
poetry world and went straight to the lushly illustrated cover story on     
cannabis.) I asked him about his views on the poetry/theory thread.     
After denying any easy parallels with the gender-talk thread, he said it    
reminded him of the rumpus raised about a composer he used to know.     
    
"'A guy who reasons so much about his art cannot produce beautiful      
works naturally'--so some people *said*," he murmured, "thereby     
depriving genius of its rationality and reducing it to a purely instinctive 
and, so to speak, vegetable function."    
    
(CB tends to be a bit oldfashioned when it comes to genius, greateness, etc.)   
What about alchemical cries of Foul re creating art out of theory, I asked. 
    
"An utterly wacky view. Critic into poet--that would indeed be a    
wholly new event in the history of the arts, a reversal of all psychical    
laws, a monstrosity."     
    
But not vice versa, I prompted.   
    
"On the contrary, all great poets naturally, inevitably become critics. I feel  
sorry for poets guided by their instincts alone; I regard them as incomplete.   
In the spiritual life of great poets, a crisis is bound to occur that leads 
them to regard their art critically, to seek the mysterious laws that guided    
them . . ."    
    
It won't surprise the reader to learn that CB regarded the poet as the best 
of all critics.    
    
Then, feeling relaxed, we took a recent post to the list on this topic and  
discovered to our surprise that it was actually an instance of skillfully   
worded negative advertising. Follows our collaboration intended to      
make this clear--though, as CB remarked, clarity isn't everything,      
even when it comes to critics/spirits.

AN AD FOR SPIRITS  
    
Every poetic "mope" (every "fruct" in fract) is imbued with and attacked by a   
theoretical alcohol which both informs it and from which it does not separate   
except in the haze of those who would create a transparent vodka simulacrum 
where the pure is alcohol-free. Fortunately these isolated teetotalers are  
not themselves distillers although some use the wassailability to reform their  
misguided drinking habits. We have bottles which are embossed with throat   
cultures and some drinkers and even some distributers pretend not to see that.  
Draughts are not purer than toddies and unthinking mopes are the products of    
both and as such do not exist in desolation, nor can they be distilled into a   
salable spirit, although some use the possibility to formalize their    
mislabeled poetics.

Good, I was too lazy to further the issue, but now it's been raised.  I'm   
also concerned, though, that we don't repeat the problem of owning this     
particular discussion to ourselves . . . .  You know?  I've been finding    
it rather difficult to engage with the Boy Talk posts and not for the   
lack of interest . . . until this issue ... made itself known.  Anyway:     
it's very interesting the gender politics of music.  At least with lit I    
believe there has been either a more concerted effort on the part of    
writers/critics to bring/integrate/etc women into view.  And 
traditionally there have been a great deal of women who wrote--something    
should be said about the habitating of this interiorized space of   
writing: diaries, notebooks, etc. that are very much part of an ecriture    
feminine that does not necessarily have to translate into public voice.     
Hm.  Nonetheless, writing has had, I believe, more of a gender equity   
than visual arts or music.  Particularly the latter.  This is not to say    
it has been blind where gender is concerned, but that writing seems to  
have offered women more of an opportunity to create.  This is a point my    
partner makes (who works for the National Museum of Women in the Arts)  
when she talks about the different creative opportunities available for     
women.  Art, she says, requires more than pen and paper--and that is a  
major reason that women do not always have the opportunity to express   
themselves.  Even so, they are often the recipients of a sexism that is     
either unable or unwilling to engage their work with any degree of      
critical engagement--except to write it off.  When it comes to music I  
think the gender differences are even more striking than visual art--it's   
almost as if the more one enters the traditional realm of HIGH ART the  
less women are present.  And music, traditionally, has presented great  
obstacles in terms of resources to producing it.  And to get around to  
your point about the relation between high/low and diversity, perhaps   
what is of particular value in the postmodern effacement of the     
differences between high/popular that women now have as much access to  
the means of production.  This is particularly important if we are      
talking about the production of symphonic, orchestral, chamber, or      
serious music (I realize the limitations of these terms, but I want to  
specify my own interest in the production of women in this area--no     
matter how difficult it might be to distinguish it from  ...).  I am also   
interested in how women have made use of the tradition of western music     
and its 20th century developments, to what purposes they are putting    
serialism, cacophony, mixed mediums, etc and why these are not as   
well-recieved as their male counter parts who make use of the same      
tradition.

It may warrant noting that "composer" as used    
in reference to a Western classical tradition    
need not necessarily apply to traditions in which    
the distinctions made between improvosation/     
composition/ interpretation/ performance are     
minimal, if imposed at all.   
 It may also be worth noting the relevance   
to poetics of  the above consideration.   
    
 Anyway, good sources for some of the above      
mentioned artists (and many others):  
    
Stern's Music

7th Floor      
New York, NY  10012

Original Music     
418 Lasher Road    
Tivoli, NY  12583  
(914) 756-2767     
    
    
Stern's is run by Ken Braun, who is one of the most  
knowledgable men in the country regarding    
African music, and their catalog is the best source  
I've come across for both classical and modern music     
from around the world.    
    
Original is run by John Storm Roberts, whose book    
"Black Music of Two Worlds" is an excellent introduction 
African music on both sides of the Atalntic.     
    
    
Hope this is helpful/ interesting, etc...

Readers who don't know Iskrenko's poetry should check out _Third Wave:

Milo de Angeles gives the lie to himself. No sisterly love that. Rather,    
theory takes a bow as your typical chauvinistic, patriarchical man,     
who's more in love with his view of the relationship (his reasonings and    
desires) than he is in love with his partner and what _she_ might have to

Dear Spencer:  
    
Thanks for responding. One does feel invisible around here sometimes,   
even when decloaked. It's reassuring to be addressed occasionally   
(like the holographic emergency medical officer on ST Voyager, I    
just want a name) Anyway, I had some further thoughts about this    
theory thread, which occasionally, it seems to me, threatens to     
collapse into an absurdity of miscommunication.      
    
It would be interesting to track the history of the institution of      
"theory", especially as it replaced "philosophy" and "literary      
criticism" as the acceptable form of explanation. People throw this     
word around like they know what it means, but I just get more       
confused. My own (admittedly limited) sense is that the recent      
popularization of theory as an institution is based on a kind of    
bastard marriage of Marxism and Freudism as they tried to hitch their   
marvelous 19th century systematic architectures of revelation onto the  
science bandwagon. From thence via Frankfurt, we sudddenly find     
ourselves in the midst of a world in which something called  
"under-theorization" has replaced certain "sins".    
    
Papa Charlie (the absent father?) sends in his hit men (be they     
jazz musicians or imported Euro-brains) to try and get the kids to      
cool it by overwhelming them with the "obvious", as if this discourse   
of "theory" itself were, what did James Sherry call it, "transparent"?  
As if it didn't have a history. As if it weren't the center of a very   
specific world, one in which "practice" (another interesting 
institution) is "based on" certain abstract "principles" (Yikes!    
shades of Plato.) What does it mean in 1995 to affirm a world that      
looks like this? Does asking this question mean that I am    
anti-intellectual, that I don't want to "think" about poetry, that I    
just want to wallow in words like some kind of Romantic pig? 
    
Well, given the responses here so it would seem.     
    
Hang in there.

It strikes me as appropriate that just after our exchange on the list   
about Language poetry that the New YOrk Times should mention it. so if  
any of you want to konw about Language Poetry, read the New York Times  
book review 2/20/95. The charts and text really give you the straight   
skinny about Language Poetry, although somehow the New YOrk school gets     
omitted. This article is indicative.  
    
Please does anyone know the author of that piece, I want us all to thank    
her for her amazing understanding of the poetry world and the work of poets?    
Send her name and number in confidence to me. All inquiries will be     
understood.

Nice post.  I do feel stupid for not having a coherent body of theoretical

I like your point about the academy needing a good dose of marketing to pay 
attention to certain trends:

demarcations . . . 
    
You've got to hand it to the Lang Poets, they know marketing.       
    
but, really, how entrenched is an L-P writing method in the university?     
 Could we come up with a location matchup and some market data?  L-P    
infiltration appears to have been sucessfully implemented in Buffalo, UC San    
Diego, San Francisco State, Brown, Sonoma, Simon Frazer, Albany (no),   
Toronto?, Montreal?, and say 20 more campuses for good measure versus the   
rest of the colleges and universities who offer writing programs.  That's   
about 30 LPs versus ____ .  Can anyone fill in the blank?

Some thoughts (we hope) about theory and boy and girl talk and other matters,   
prefaced by the disclaimer that I had a system crash yesterday and lost four    
days' worth of posts and mail--so if I repeat what someone's already said, am   
not responding to someone, whatever, apologies.      
    
Bill Luoma asks a statistical question about the "entrenchment" of LP writing   
method (a category I'd question, Bill, because I'm not convinced that there is  
a method in the same way that there seems to be a workshop method, and this 
absence of a "method" may explain what remains LP's relative academic   
marginality--its absence of a monolithic method doesn't endear it to creative   
writing programs. Whew--did that long parenthesis make sense?). But I'd fill    
in your blank, Bill, with "100s." One could find out from Associated Writing    
Programs. More generally, rumors of LP's academic entrenchment are (as Bill 
implies) greatly exagerrated. Two points: (1) there's a distinction to be made  
between establishment in the academic side of English Depts. and in writing 
programs. I teach LP in academic English courses, but no one here exploits the  
possibilities of its method(s) in creative writing courses. (2) This so-called  
"entrenchment" gets exaggerated by LP's already entrenched opponents (a     
strategy that parallels the right's strategy in the NEH/NEA wars and in other   
fora--though I emphatically do not want to associate divergence from LP with    
the right, which would be silly). I'm just saying that despite an emergent  
body of criticism on LP, the increased visibility of particular poets, and so   
on, still a very small number of writers who might be associated with that  
increasingly amorphous-looking tendency are engaged in full-time academic   
work, nor do I think that their work exactly saturates syllabi nation-wide. 
    
On the recent theory exchanges: interesting that the theory discussion and the  
boy/girl talk have been going on simultaneously but in parallel lines, without  
much crossover. What's the relation between theory (the tendency to theorize,   
the kind of theorizing that gets done) and gender? I'd like to hear from some   
of the female subscribers as to their take on the theory discussion. Does   
theory mean something to you (in "theory" and in practice) different from what  
it means to male participants (I'm not assuming that I know what it means to    
them, by the way)? I just have the intuition that there's a connection between  
these two current threads that's getting suppressed or not talked about or  
overlooked. Is it just coincidence that they're going at the same time, but 
separately?    
  Given recent posts like Juliana Spahr's referring to boy's talk about boy's   
books, I suspect not. Y'all, as we say here in Kentucky, can let me know if 
I'm off base.  
    
Also: "theory" means something different to academics and to poets. I think 
that what Spencer, James, and Tom have been debating as theory, I'd be more 
inclined to call poetics. Or at least I'd make this distinction, which is an    
institutional one, not an essential one: that in most current intellectual  
debate, "theory" means a certain body of poststructuralist texts and thought    
that, yes, obviously, is deeply tied up with the writing practice of many   
people on this list, but that is used in the academy to marginalize poetry. Or  
to put it bluntly, many more people in universities are interested in theory    
than they are in poetry. So: I just wanted to (re)call to people's minds this   
definition and use of "theory." LP has the wonderful power (as do Emily     
Dickinson and Wallace Stevens) to interest people who are also interested in    
theory. Sorry if this risks academicizing the whole issue unduly--just  
reporting from the site where I spend most of my time.   
    
To Sandra (Braman): I was shocked by your report of Larry Grossberg's claim 
that doing pure theory (whatever exactly that would mean--I'm not sure--what    
would purify it, and how would one assess its purity?) was the only meaningful  
contemporary politics. I'd be interested to hear more about this, either on or  
off line. On the surface it sounds like a kind of quietist reiteration of the   
old arguments about the political efficacy of deconstruction, but maybe I'm 
missing something.

Has anyone here read Viswanathan's new book about the history of    
"literary" studies in India? Basic assertion that literary studies      
in English began not in England or America, still under the classical   
mode of learning, but in India where it was used to "Anglicize" Indian  
subjects, ie, the teaching of English values through English literature     
meant to "replace" their own culture, which was obviously devalued      
as "primitive."    
 My point is to suggest that if we want to historicize theory,      
a very good idea incidentally, we cannot forget to do the same      
for art, and for philosophy, and particularly not for "literary     
criticism.""Any document of civilization..." etc.    
 Thanks, Eric.

Hi, good to see you de-lurk, John.  I'll have to think about it,

a problem of limiting cases that you've raised, rarely possible to

In the last paragraph of "Cultural Criticism and Society," Theodor W.   
Adorno writes:     
    
Cultural criticism finds itself faced with the final stage of the dialectic 
of culture and barbarism.  To write poetry after the holocaust is barbaric. 
And this corrodes even the knowledge of why it has become impossible to     
write poetry today.  Absolute reification, which presupposed intellectual   
progress as one of its elements, is now preparing to absorb the mind    
entirely.  Critical intelligence cannot be equal to this challenge as long  
as it confines itself to self-satisfied contemplation."  (_Prisms_.  Trans. 
Samuel and Sherry Weber.  Cambridge: MIT P, 1981.)   
    
In Part Three of _Negative Dialectics,_ Adorno revised the statement.   
    
Perennial suffering has as much right to rexpression as a tortured man has  
to scream; hence it may have been wrong to say that after Auschwitz you     
could no longer write poems.  But it is not wrong to raise the less     
cultural question whether after Auschwitz you can go on living--especially  
whether one who escape by accident, one who bu rights should have been  
killed, may go on living.  His mere survival calls for the coldness, the    
basic principle of bourgeois subjectivity, without which there could have   
been no Auschwitz; this is the drastic guilt of him who was spared.     
(_Negative Dialectics_.  Trans. A.B. Ashton.  New York: Continuum, 1973.    
363.)

is garbage" (367).

  DEEP CYBERSPACE (AHP) - A 26-foot long tapeworm was caught    
 by weary computing engineers yesterday, who claimed the foul-smelling  
 creature had been feeding off the Net.  Now on display, the worm has   
 turned a tiny Cyberspace village into an unexpected tourist attraction,    
 the Co-Poetry News Network reported yesterday.      
  Engineers ``netted'' the basking tapeworm -- biggest of its   
 kind ever seen in the area -- and used ropes to extract it from a gaping   
 terminal in Charles Bernstein's office in Clemens Hall at SUNY Buffalo.    
 Bernstein, away on a reading tour, had left the terminal unattended and    
 during this time the tapeworm -- nicknamed ``Benji'' by engineers --   
 apparently nestled into an intractable position.  The tapeworm drew    
 carloads of summer vacation tourists, said CNN, which showed children  
 climbing onto the giant carcass and posing for snapshots.

what this would mean, for you, is everytime a new issue comes out,      
there would be a group of documents to add (one for each publication    
reviews), AND the various index files (26@ for both zines & chaps)      
would have to be replaced with new versions...  if this is unclear,     
i'll send (on disk) the initial prototype.  if it _is_ clear, and   
looks to be more than you bargained for, lemme know.     
    
i'm kind of psyched to actually have documents coded & linked,      
and daunted by the prospect of converting all the back issues       
into the new format.  but i think it'll be pretty impressive 
when done, and ultimatly may GET SOME OF THIS STUFF READ, which     
is ov course the goal not to loose site of....  i'm curious, too,   
if the mention in _Online Access_ had a noticable impact on  
logins to the system--any statistics yet?

To eric, et al:    
    It's good you bring up the view that all culture should be      
historicized.  I've been reading Said's _Culture and Imperialism_ and the   
point is not simply to historicize, but to point out that the supposed  
greatness and fact of existence of European culture is made possible,   
implicated to the highest degree, with the system of imperial/colonial  
exploitation.  Beyond this, Said suggests looking at discrepent     
experiences of colonial relations--texts from different perspectives on     
colonial experience whose commonality does not efface their important   
differences.  This is a rejection of a "pure" aesthetic realm; a    
rejection of "humanism"; a rejection of "unitariness; and an imperative     
to unthink the ridgid separation of politics and aesthetics.  One should    
include theory in the latter, I believe, and, even, indict it on  the   
same terms....  Just some thoughts.

Spencer Selby says:"I expect something of the results of my poetry; anyone who i

Dear Spencer,  
     I would like you to look closer at "anticipation of 
results", because I think you could find just there, thought that may   
never be more than muttered to yourself, or even quite silent, but in   
which something other than the poem to be written or the poem in hand   
or the poem just written is saying, for example "Some other  
person(s), whether living or dead, would like/not like   
this, because...."  how is that not theoretical, that is dependent on   
a stance in regard to others who will read or hear the poem.  Will it   
"move" someone else in any way?  I would have thought that the use of   
theory to poets was that in between writing they could sort out what    
went wrong with the  last poem or what went right.  Between posts   
(?poems) several people on this list are theorizing the post and the    
network.   
   What you seem perturbed about is the thought that poems should   
conform to a prior encapsulation of right method(s) for producing   
what has already been determined as "good" poetry.  Theory as       
prescription is a worry, yes.  But that doesn't mean that poetry can    
be disentangled from the theory that goes into the making of it.

Adorno was obviously a pessimist.  A cynic.  But did that keep him from     
exercising his own critique?  Perhaps it is garbage, but there seems to     
be an equal if not more pressing imperative/responsibility to       
produce/create/make/whatever in the face of such institutional forms of     
fascism.  Today.

I met Nina once here in Providence last year. As Ron said, she had a keen   
wit and a great sense of humor. She also possessed the ability to be, to    
simply engage in conversation with a conviction that never once waivered.   
At our very brief encounter I told her of a project I'm working on and  
three months later, battling breast cancer, she sent four "poems for deaf   
people" - drawings of the slightest filigree composed entirely of words.    
They remind me of some of Michaux's line-work and captivate with a similar  
drift between language and line, between cultures - so to speak. This   
gesture provides a lasting tether. Here's one of her poems from     
"Third-Wave" (pg 91) translated by Anesa Miller-Pogacar: 
    
    
/a biography from the opposed, 1989/  
    
The author belongs to the generation born in the 1950's and realizing its   
creative strivings in that period of our history that proved to be an epoch 
of sharply developed absurdism and carefully preserved principles of highly 
artistic stagnation. Being accustomed since childhood to the paradoxical    
phenomena of everyday life with theri unforseeable consequences, knowing    
how to get my in the majority of situations without common sense or     
psychological ease, with a strict immunity to all that can be had without   
struggle, that wich is passed out one apice-all of this sooner or later     
creates a corresponding supply of firmness, or, if you wish, a natural  
conservatism, pritecting its bearer from simple decisions and direct paths  
to even the most obvious truths, This healthy conservatism lays a   
noticeable imprint on the stylistics and character of the depicted, and it  
also explains-metaphorically at least - a cluster of phenomena that defy    
more reasoned means of interpretation. Specifically, these are certain  
facts of the "biography from the opposed." Having obvious inclinatins   
toward the humanities-toward literature, musci, drawing, etc.- the author   
nonetheless spends six years studying at Moscow University in order to,     
having obtained a diploma in physics, never again to return to the natural  
sciences, those ex-personal froms of interacting with the surrounding   
reality; having selected, as primary orientation, the word, and as shelter  
of necessity - the trivial pusuit of work as a translator of scientific and 
techinical literature from English to Russian. A family and two children    
convincingly fill out the picture of a normal existence for a Russian woman 
in the contemporary literary process, an existence that was secret for many 
years and even shameful in the eyes of others, to reveal itself only in the 
past year or two with a few publications. Thus, it is not surprising that   
the author accepts any signs of attention paid to her humble persona with a 
certain dubiousness and perplexity; for this she offers excuses in the form 
of gratitude, and gratitude in the form of a text whose rehearsal coincides 
with its final result.

Just a brief reply, but I think it is a majoy misunderstanding to think     
of Adorno as a cynic. A pessimist, certainly. To some extent a paralyzed    
thinker, I grant. But not a cynic. A cynic gives in to the barbarity.   
A cynic gives up the ever more problematic possibility of Utopia.   
 Adorno had a hell of a lot of problems as a person and sometimes   
as a thinker, but he was never a cynic.   
 Thanks, Eric.

Dear Mike:     
    
    War bird decloaking at starboard.  I wonder if anyone has read  
Sidney or Shelley's Defense of Poetry in the last 20 years?  I think    
"theory" has taken the place of philosophy in the equation.  I used to  
think it was pseudo-psychology in its reading of poetry and its authors.    
    
    All lean toward the destruction of poetry's power as soverign   
in human imagination.  Without the poets there is no hope.  We will     
not be educated, consoled, inspired, loved or moved to action in this   
brazen world - only the poets can deliver a golden (to quote a buddy).  
    
    We all know who they are.  They are written on our hearts. Whether  
alive or elsewhere they get the job done, usually alone, on the screen  
or in the streets, curled up around a terminal or allowing it to fade "like 
a sand painting at the end of day" their labors keep all of creation    
going - otherwise all is entropy.  All else is A River of Ka-Ka sold at     
a very high price. 
    
    When I think of theory and Blake, I know he came to his in the  
work - and when he found it he abandoned the Four Zoas to write Jerusalem.  
    
    I believe every poet discovers "theory" in this way.  It reveals    
itself.    
    
    All hail the Poets.  They keep us free and laughing in an other-    
wise dismal prospect.  Call me Post-Romantic.

Subject:  Re: theory and being heard  
    
    Dear Mark (Wallace), in response to your claim of having to be a theory 
    to be heard, what then do you have to be to listen? Do only theories    
 listen to theory?    
 In any event, I do not claim to find any comfort in the hegemony of    
 "theory" in the academy, and I do not intend my response to be "flip"  
 and "merely rhetorical" but "THEORY IS POETRY IN DRAG" can, as a motto,    
 approximate a perspective a legitimate (i.e. IT PAYS) tradition is     
 (re)-forming around, regardless of ruptures that on an institutional   
 level are reinscribed into what becomes read as a "debate."    
 I am trying to avoid the cynical resignation in the face of a compartment- 
 alized view of the world. For such "resignation" simply perpetuates it.    
 And if I may lapse for a second an indulge myself in a freudian metaphor,  
 isn't it possible, Mark, that sometimes what seems more like "theory"  
 than "poetry" actually falls more on the "side" of the intrinsically   
 motivated ID rather than the extrinsic SUPEREGO? And thus, ocassionally    
 if you didn't DO POETRY you'd be out of a job? Or is this just a matter    
 of interpretation on my part.... 
 As for Alan Golding's rewording of what many have called "theory" as   
 really POETICS, which he claims is an institutional rather than    
 essential distinction, that doesn't seem "accurate"--for "academic     
 theory" only becomes poetics if put into dialogue with poets and   
 or poems... Granted, we're on a POETIC list, so we can claim we're     
 some kind of hermetically sealed interpretative community gathered     
 around some transcendental signifier BUT isn't the question to some    
 extent the idea that there exists this THEORY which in itself is   
 HOSTILE to poetry, in a way quite different from "poetics" is...   
 Now, this "hostility" of course brings in the whole question of    
 whether thinking binary is a CAUSE of cultural disenchantment or   
 merely a rhetorical exercise to show off one's "wit" with not externAl 
 ramifications in the "real world"--And thus, that dreaded question     
 of TONE becomes raised again in a piece of writing (this) that is  
 marketable NEITHER as theory or poetry, and then one wonders if there  
 is communication only with commodification, and I drank another dollar 
 to quench my thirst for anti-naive-vulgar organic humanism (which  
 of course is really really really what we all want "underneath it all")    
 All of my love, Chris

Dear Alan and others--    
Susan Schultz and I discussed the boy/girl issue in Hawaii two weeks ago    
and I brought it up when Ron Silliman,  Lyn Hejinian, and Leslie Scalapino  
were here for the Ginsberg censorship affair last week.  Interestingly,     
Lyn and Leslie say they never see the poetics net; Joan Retallack tells     
me the same thing and I guess in general we girls just don't do it as much. 
Why? (1) as one correspondent wrote in, we DO have too much to do. I don't  
see how the men have the TIME to write endlessly back and forth.  and (2)   
this mode of communication is somehow unsatisfactory to women.  It really   
IS a gender issue, I think.  I like to write to someone, not everyone/  
anyone.  A mode of address.  A form of life.     
Writing to those "out there" is somehow unappealing, as Kathleen Fraser was 
saying the other day.     
So: it's great for messages like, "What is the title of that book?" or  
here are three conferences coming up--a bulletin board.  But beyond that?   
well-I think we'll let the men go for it.    
    
Another topic (here it's useful): who IS Dinitia Smith, who wrote that  
article?  She never contacted me but I did get a call from the photo dept   
asking for a picture.  The dept. here sent it and then they called back to  
say sorry, they could only use "one in every category."  I was so glad the  
cartoon wasn't of me.     
Where did she learn of her "language poets"?? I wonder who was her source of    
information?   
Bye, men!

To eric, et al:    
    It's good you bring up the view that all culture should be      
historicized.  I've been reading Said's _Culture and Imperialism_ and the   
point is not simply to historicize, but to point out that the supposed  
greatness and fact of existence of European culture is made possible,   
implicated to the highest degree, with the system of imperial/colonial  
exploitation.  Beyond this, Said suggests looking at discrepent     
experiences of colonial relations--texts from different perspectives on     
colonial experience whose commonality does not efface their important   
differences.  This is a rejection of a "pure" aesthetic realm; a    
rejection of "humanism"; a rejection of "unitariness; and an imperative     
to unthink the ridgid separation of politics and aesthetics.  One should    
include theory in the latter, I believe, and, even, indict it on  the   
same terms....  Just some thoughts.

     SAN FRANCISCO (AHP) -- A cyberzoo can take its toll on     
 even the toughest old birds, and these birds were never very       
 tough to begin with.     
     Forty-four ``light-winged Dryads of the trees'' have       
 fallen dead silent; a population that once reached 44 is down      
 to four.      
     ``It would appear ... that it's the wrong zoo for the      
 species and, indeed, it's no doubt the wrong species for zoos,''   
 said Kali Tal, president of the animal rights group Hungry  
 Generation.   
     But generalizations are difficult. For instance, these     
 particular nightingales share neither habitat nor coloration.      
 They come in all shapes and sizes. Some call Hawaii home, some

 hail from Buffalo. And their song is not necessarily the same      
 one heard by ``emperor and clown.''  
     In fact, the unusual braying sound has earned the birds    
 a nickname from snide zookeeper Ira Lightman -- ``jackass   
 nightingales'' -- though others describe the sound as more like    
 the coo of an angry dove.    
     But why are the birds so stressed?      
     For one thing, there are well over five males competing    
 for the attention of one female, a panel of experts noted.  
     For another, unknown predators have gotten into the feed   
 lines and parodied several of the nightingales.     
     And instead of a big, blue sky to parade in when they get      
 hot and bothered, they have a 1-foot-square screen.     
     Still, said Kali Tal, relenting in her earlier pessimism,      
 ``birds do just fine on other lists.''   
     A panel of experts made their official recommendation this     
 week in a memo to head superintendent Charles Bernstein. According     
 to a secret source, the memo urged a shutdown of ``Poetics@ubvm,''     
 and immediate dispersal of the birds.

     ``The nightingale issue has gone beyond what is in the best    
 interest of the nightingales, and I want to refocus on their welfare,''    
 said noted animal rights activist Liz Willis.   
     List spokesperson Alan Golding acknowledged the ``bird     
 talk'' program has had its ``ups and downs.''   
     ``We're out of kilter right now, definitely out of kilter,''   
 he said.      
     Noted another expert, Juliana Spahr, ``The problem is the      
 concept of aviaries itself, you know, birds perched on swings. We'll   
 have to do away with the whole `polly wanna cracker' mentality if      
 we want any actual change.''     
     The last time activists got so upset at the zoo was in 1994,   
 when Betina, a 5-ton bull elephant, died after being tranquilized      
 so she could be caged for shipment to a more suitable list. 
     Most of the nightingales died of diseases that were 
 aggravated by stress due to boredom, competition and malnutrition,     
 the panel said.   
     Poetics has tried to give the birds more ventilation in    
 their tiny pens by installing a new subject line and cutting

 back on brashness. It's also considering zookeeper Mark Nowak's    
 recommendation that other species of birdsong be piped into the    
 aviary.   
     And it's looking at easing the gender pressure by boosting     
 the population to include as many females as males, consultant Cris    
 Cheek said.

Hi Tony, and it's a cheep cheep   
from the chirpy    
over, "here, here!".   
    
    Of course your take on 'theory' and 'poetry' does presume   
that everybody writes poems with a reader 'in mind'. Or, splitting it down  
more to further -  a reader Other than Them Selves. But even a dialogue     
within Them Selves' work will produce the intimate inter-relations you  
articulate.

    At heart (I'm recently reconciling myself to using what I   
saw before as a centralising anatomical reference but now re-emphasise its  
decentralising function, from the left) poetry is social (interpersonal and 
yes political) in a most challenged sense.       
    
    The issue which has been mentioned several times here is    
that of voicing, reading out loud  -  which seems crucial to this   
discussion. It makes a useful bridge (I'm always up for building 'em) to    
issues of composition and to oral - improvisatory traditions and innovative 
oral - improvisatory 'practice' (surely it's always practice, however   
'accomplished it gets - that's its edge which admits process - is process   
an institution?).  
    
Having said which I would also be disturbed by what you describe as 'poems  
being written in order to conform to a prior encapsulation of right     
method(s) for production'. That way lies closure. But is anybody on this    
list proposing that?   
I've read no evidence of it.      
Thanks for your post  -  it may have wafted the smokescreen a touch.    
    
I.m worried that there is an idealism footloose with the fancy that's   
chirping a hymn of variation  -  too whit:       
    
'there is a theory far away, without a city wall'

This mode of communication is not unsatisfactory to me -- and       
ain't I a woman?  It's not perfect, but it's not a bad substitute for   
a real live community.  After just a few posts I've made several    
valuable personal connections via this list.  Gone are the   
strictures of geography and social placement.  My interlocutors     
are not limited to people I know, hence "internet" --  a "form of   
life" -- a cocktail party where everyone's invited, and it   
doesn't matter what you wear,  just as long as you are there . . .      
    
Not to attack ad feminem, but it's one thing if you are a    
tenured person  of power at a major university with a brood of      
influential books -- you don't need a forum.  I do.   I don't have      
time for or invitations to all those conferences.   I am not in     
close proximity to good English-language libraries or small  
press  bookstores.   Usually when I hear my language spoken  
it's work-related or expat gossip or badly -translated news.  Or    
the beautiful flawed pidgin from my students.    
    
And if writing to those "out there " is unappealing, why not 
just write letters?  Why publish anything?  No desire at all to     
ripple the pond?  Trace your subjectivity?  Make your voice  
resound?  Of course you want to do these things -- Marjorie, 
Kathleen, Leslie -- or you wouldn't be in the positions you're in   
now.  You (especially Kathleen) would not have made it   
possible for me a generation down to say what I'm saying right      
now.  All the net's a stage!  And the men are all the players. . .      
    
 Letting  "the men go for it" is  the waste of a medium, the 
waste of minds, a passive knuckling-under, tantamount to 
letting the men make wars, oppress people, and argue     
themselves into nightmares of sophistry.  So I will agree that      
"it really IS a gender issue," but not in the way you mean.  
    
So I send out this call to my good and strong aunts  -- if you      
speak here, you make space for me (and my sisters -- pardon  
the 70's-ish rhetoric) to speak here too. You'll also make the      
discussions decidedly more interesting.

Dear Alan Golding & everyone:     
    
The discussions re: "boy talk" and "theory" *have* crossed over: In my  
original post, to which Bill Luoma was responding, I'd noted that   
Gertrude Stein, Mina Loy and Djuna Barnes didn't provide separate bodies    
of criticial writings (I said Stein's "criticism" or "theory" or    
"poetics" didn't feel "separate" to me--that _How to Write_ felt not much   
different in style, approach & intention to (say) _A Novel of Thank     
You_), and was hoping POETICS list readers might pick up on the fact that   
these writers were women. Implication being (generally) that "poetics   
talk" or "theory" *tends* to be a male preoccupation. Of course that's a    
wild generalization to make--there are exceptions. Also, I didn't mean to   
imply that language poetry was wildly successful in academe, but that   
relative to Stein, Loy & Barnes (& let's add Bernadette Mayer--another  
influence on language and other contemporary writers), well, relative to    
writers like Bernstein, Andrews, Silliman, Scalapino, Perelman & so on,     
the earlier 20th century women experimental or exploratory or whathaveyou   
writers weren't acknowledged by people in universities as quickly as the    
language poets have been. (Not by *all* people in universities, or *all*    
universities, mind you.) I suppose you could say that Stein's Yale series   
was a form of academic "acknowledgment"--but, I'd argue that she *paid*     
for those books to be published (the money for them left via her will),     
and that, of course, Yale never bothered to reprint any of them after   
they went out of print. (Except for a _Selected_.)   
    
Of course, the _Times_ article on "The Poetry Pantheon" was ridiculous,     
but do note that the only "exploratory" group of poets mentioned there  
was the language poets--as though all of us writing non-mainstream poetry   
were "language poets." I was amazed, reading a fairly recent essay by   
Jefferson Hansen that appeared in _Poetic Briefs_--& Jeff's a really    
talented poet & not unbrilliant guy--I was amazed that he could imply   
that younger poets (like myself & hundreds--thousands?--of others) were     
all "influenced" or, in his words, "were greatly indebted to" the   
language poets. This is absurd, of course, and suggests that what might     
have happened or be in the process of happening is that people are      
tending to lump all "exploratory" poets into a single camp: language    
poetry. My own influences are mostly artists, writers & thinkers who did    
their work prior to 1970.     
    
At any rate, I'd love to hear what others, men or women on this list,   
have to say about "theory" or "poetics"--especially what the women have     
to say: *Is* theory, *is* this notion that "Great poets have & make     
public their insights into other 'great' poets" a particularly *male*   
preoccupation? (Alan, if you don't know what that quote refers to, if you   
lost Bernstein's original post, e-mail me separately & I'll pass along  
the original post, which was a selection from a new book Sun & Moon has     
just published.)   
    
Yours,     
    
Gary.

Dear David:    
    
I don't remember offhand who said that, but if memory serves me, it was     
re-quoted by Eliot Weinberger in one of his two essay books (_Outsider  
Stories_ or _Works on Paper_). I don't have either of those books anymore   
so I can't look them up for you, but I'm pretty sure you'll find it--and    
I think Weinberger did cite the original--in one of them.    
    
Good luck. Yours--Gary.

without 'taking sides,' i'd like to express my enthusiasm for nada's assertion  
that it would be a "waste of a medium" for women to let "the men go for it"...  
    
there are all sorts of gender issues at stake in a space such as this... it's   
not simply how many women post/lurk vs. how many men (though this is in fact    
*does* constitute, for me, a sort of bottom-line litmus of gender), there's 
also the question raised by alan golding as to the parallel boy talk/theory 
threads (for example)... part of the way to see these threads as connected  
IS simply not to treat them as separate (!)... i mean, why is the boy talk  
thread by its very nature NOT theoretical?... i would have to argue that it 
is in fact a theorized discussion---though it's theory in a different vein, 
hence it's perceived (by some) as atheoretical... i had in mind two items   
in reading alan's post:  rachel blau duplessis' essay "for the etruscans"   
(a poetic inquiry into "feminist aesthetic") and what i've heard from certain   
communities of women (virtual and otherwise) re "theory"---that it's all too    
often practiced in ways that exclude alternative voices/soundings...    
    
a few typos in that paragraph above, i hate line editors...  
    
anyway... there's something about that suggestion (who made it?) about shutting 
up and letting the women speak that appeals to me, albeit i understand this 
as a provisional gesture... we have to learn to dance with one another...   
    
and believe me, this medium filters out *my* more active (male, i guess)    
presence (ftf, that is), so i'm not pretending in any way to have developed 
an immunity to what i'm busy t/hereabouts criteeking...  
    
so i'll shut up now...

Too busy doing other things? You mean, like _Radical Artifice_? Marjorie,   
that's disingenuous of you to say you're above "boy talk," considering  
you make your living writing about poetry & poetics & theory--what we're    
equating (or what some of us are equating here) with "boy talk."    
    
Maybe what you mean is that you're above writing about theory *here*,   
where you're not getting paid to do it? Are your classes at wherever you    
teach totally unlike the discussions here on the net?

why, I think, most of us are here, huh? But I'm troubled by the resistence  
to the various discources (let's not pin it down to post-structuralism,     
poetics, philosophies, etc: theory is what is used) that come, today,   
under the category of "theory."   
 When I graduated from high school, barely I might add, I knew I was    
interested in writing poetry. Knew that's how I wanted to spend my life.    
Didn't know where to, though, because where I grew up the only book store   
in town was a used paper back place that sold mostly horror and romances.   
So, like many of my friends, I went to the local community college, where   
a teacher became interested and encouraged me to keep writing, and indeed   
to go into a "writing program."   
 So I shuffled off to a CSU in the San Fernando Valley, the only    
place I could get into with a 1.9 hi school average, and became very    
interested in the scene down there, Beyond Baroque, the BEBOP, etc.     
My profossers of writing encouraged me to read langpo, and ny school    
etc, because of course this was a hip school after all, if it couldn't  
quite be a prestigious one. The point is that they were very receptive.     
 (If this is boring you can skip to the last paragraph; I'm     
currently involved in the very Foucault-esque thrill of confessing and  
realize this is more of a kick for me than you) Ultimately, I went to   
a graduate writing program here at LSU. I studied with Codrescu, and    
Rodger (hey Rodger) and Dave Smith. Odd grouping, I know and in fact, for   
me, this was very disconcerting because I kept getting mixed ideas as   
to what poetry was. I became very confused as each tried to shape my    
work. I began writing a kind of workshop poetry (as Golding terms it and    
it is a very good term), though I tried to reconfigure it, subvert it   
as I discovered the fiction of Acker and to a certain extent Auster. But    
I was never quite satisfied.      
 I graduated and stayed for a Ph.D. I discovered theory, particularly   
the to me thrilling and disparate writings in Western Marxism. Then I   
discovered post/neo colonial stuff, and I began re-reading my poetry    
and the poetry I was reading and I realized how naive I was;they were.  
How much they left out because they weren't keeping up with the explosion   
of extremely various writings out there all called theory. I re-read    
Frank O'Hara, found him to be fabulous in ways I never saw before. The  
l-school I saw as being the most sophisticated thinkers in poetry I knew.   
I re-read Audre Lorde, Sonia Sanchez, found them tapped into culture    
more intimately then any of the mainstream political poets. Ultimately,     
I signed on to this list and I realized (suck up) that I could talk     
about these things for the first time with other poets, which I     
couldn't do before (except with Rodger, obviously). Realized that there     
were differences there, but they were aware, into it, not still talking     
about line breaks, point of view, etc.    
 And that's where I am now. Stuck selling a book I wrote when I was     
a little more naive, though the things I was writing about I still think    
was very important to me but the way I was writing seems naive, dated.  
And better working, still working, on a method that ties in everything  
I've learned then, and now.   
    The point is that if you are not aware that as you write to certain     
extent you are theorzing, you end up theorizing badly, which is what I was  
doing. You end up seeming naive, lost, confused. I know, Cass, that you     
and all the others on this list perhaps cannot identify too much with my    
story because you already knew the "avant-garde" was the most interesting   
and legitimate tradition, the only international one, as I believe Tom  
said. But I didn't. Didn't even understand it. Until I began to theorize.   
 Hope this didn't just bore the hell out of you, but I believed your    
post required the most fully "historicized" response I could muster.    
 Thanks, Eric.

Dear Marjorie:     
    
I'll see if I can tempt you into writing to everyone/anyone again.      
    
On your first point: I'm not sure that the gendered differences in      
participation on the list occur because the women have more to do than the  
men.(I do wonder, like you, where some folks find the time, as I find even  
skimming the list tremendously time-consuming). We can probably agree that  
even in working-couple-with-family households like Gabrielle described, in  
arrangements where there's a conscious, sustained effort to make things     
equitable, women often end up being stuck with more of the load. But I'm not    
sure that the quantitative difference between male and female work      
loads/responsibilities is large enough to explain the participation     
differences we've been talking about. At least, it's not among my peers and in  
the community in which I live. In other words, I don't think this notion that   
women simply have tons more to do than men will really wash, will it?   
    
And is this mode of communication somehow unsatisfactory to women? I've been    
wondering about that myself; we've had posts suggesting how it might be, and    
Kali especially, though others have too, has talked about how it might be. But  
I much prefer to write to someone, too. (I think this is probably the first 
public e-mail letter you and I have written to each other.) On the whole this   
preference may be gendered, but I do think there are other issues beyond that.  
    
What are they? Wish I had time to figure that out.   
    
Alan

Cass,      
    
Yeah, friends have been pinging me the bandwidth in question for a      
while now.  I find some of it funny and some stoopid, or both at once.  
    
Condolences?  Soldarity?  Maybe those are appropriate, but don't    
direct them to "me," it's my "name" and "identity" that have been   
usurped, and I've already lost title to 'em.  There was a guy last      
year on the Derrida list, for instance, who copied messages, including  
mine, and posted them on other lists.  Or something--I never got it     
straight, and found the whole business bemusing.     
    
Not to say I don't care.  I do!  But I realize now I haven't any idea   
what it means to be a writer--to share my words when all I have to      
offer ARE words, with only a name to guarantee my propietary interest,  
and only a social mechanism (often bewildering, if not oppressive) to   
guarantee reception.  Until I get THAT straight, I think I'll stick     
to being a grad student, which I find much easier.   
    
E-mail is an extreme instance, for sure, but it HAS made explicit how   
in public discourse, at the most extreme edges, where all we have are   
words, dialogue in the ethical sense is impossible.  There is no    
"face to face," only an economic relation, free and not-so-free exchange    
of thoughts, feelings, bodily fluids (from the body without organs),    
echoes, ventriloquism, plays within plays.       
    
"Ben Friedlander" may be my "personal_name," but I could just as well   
type "Benji," "worm," even "B. Cass Clarke."  And obviously, ANYONE     
could type those names.  Identity, especially on the 'net, is just      
another subject line, easily appropriated, misused, a cover for     
something snuck in illegitimately, sometimes out of sloppiness or   
ignorance, sometimes in bad faith.  The only limits set for this    
appropriation are structural (a hacker's power far supercedes a     
parodist's) and legal (cf. the alt.sex.stories pornographer who got     
arrested for using a classmate's name).   
    
And then again, while these issues all pertain in the so-called real    
world, e-mail is different.  I have no idea what the "real" ramifications   
of that difference are, but being (like you) a Dickhead (as in Philip K.)   
I assume they're bad.     
    
I would probably be more upset if my name or identity had been used more    
maliciously--that has to be said too. 
    
But thanks for passing the junk along,    
    
Yours "in the analogy,"       
Ben

Subj:   legislators    
    
Dear Cris and Eric 
    
    Thank you both for your backchannel and public response.    
    
    You remember the line from Shelley - poets are the unacknowledged   
legislators - on that level poets have been warring with commerce, as   
well as philosophers, critics, historians etc., since an attempt at     
a definition of poetry's value, use and purpose came up for defense.    
    
    I said "post-romantic" because it is within that tradition that     
this "defense" occurs, from medieval forward - i.e. a *belief* that the     
poet performs a job that cannot be relegated to the other arts.  This   
includes the long tradition of invisibilities, knowledges that are not  
contained by philos., mathematics, etc.   
    
    That post romanticism is not recognized as valid has to do with     
the trend of treating any practise which includes some notion of power  
not material, as disreputable and exposed by the advent of deconstruction.  
For the act of poeisis depends upon a maker, an author.  These days to  
be a singular identity is to be phallocentric, anti-multicultural, etc.     
    
    Unfortunately the prime requirement of making is thrown out because 
of its patriarchal associations.  We have not yet seen how poetry will  
recover, but there are many workers out there who are bleeding tears    
trying. Including so-called language poets.      
    
    The "correct line" is not the one I'm drawing.  But here in     
Buffalo, there are many strings being pulled.  Most of the posters to   
this list are naturally caught up in the politics of the situation and  
it is national.  They want jobs. Academic jobs.  Here, if you're not    
with the lang-po project, it's not happening.  Witness major poet hirings   
nationally and you get language critics, language poets.  They control  
who gets brought in, who gets read, who gets studied - i.e. the remaking    
of the  *canon*.  So the fight, if there is one has to do with who will     
rewrite history?  Those poets who have academic jobs from the prior wave,   
Creeley, Dorn, Blaser, - I'm speaking of the Black Mt. here, for example,   
we can insert our favorites here, have understandably left the arena to the youn
and will be replaced by the next *hot* language poet.  I can think of   
others who were never part of the academic, Kyger, DiPrima, Grenier, Thorpe,    
Sanders, yes I have my favorites too, and many whose work I don't know,     
as I'm sure you can, who continue to teach and labor without the same   
 visibility afforded a tenured professor with good small press (or large)   
commitments.   
    
    It will always be this way, it ever has been.  I fall on the side   
of Mental War is Combat for the Angel, conducted by individuals armed   
with theory, philosophy, history, criticism, hell why not some architech-   
tonic too?  This chick is old-fashioned that way, and no puritan mean   
streak will put me on the sidelines with the wallflowers.    
    
    As to the legislators, someone must take the initiative. As to  
this list, it was Bernstein, I believe, who took the initiative and has,    
as far as I can tell, been courageous in his efforts to keep the lines  
open, and encourage all comers.  His kind of equanimity is becoming     
rare in this time of fear.    
    
    With regard,   
    
    Cass

Well, OK, to respond to Alan and Gary:    
    
I'm not satisfied with such a simplistic gender explanation either, so  
let me just speak for myself.     
Gary says it's disigenuous of me to say I don't have time when I do have    
time to write books.  To which one could say: well, yes, but if I spent     
much time on the e-net, I wouldn't.  But more seriously: writing articles/  
books is one thing: you work, you revise, you research and you don't    
let anything out of the house that you haven't thought through.  Conversation   
with students is a second thing--and I adore it--and that's face to face and    
really fun.    
But for me too much of what comes through this poetics group is just    
throw-away, personal little bits and it doesn't quite seem like a "conver-  
sation."  I suppose it does when I know the person as I know Alan who   
is a good friend but not when it's someone I don't know. 
So:  this is just a gut reaction to (1) having been excited when this net   
began and loving to read the messages, and (2) now feeling every day a  
sense of oh-my-god here are 25 messages on the Poetics net to plow through  
and 90% is just not interesting to me.  I'm not saying it's anyone's fault, 
but perhaps there would be a better way to organize it so that private  
conversations between A and B wouldn't just bounce back and forth and be    
left unresolved.

Regarding Adorno, as Eric Pape says, as a pessimist not a cynic, not    
giving up the "ever more problematic possibility of Utopia." 
    
Can't one be a non-cynic, in fact can't one even be an optimist (but my     
that is harder every day) without believing in Utopia. Even Thomas More     
had his problems with Utopia, creating one which was patently unlivable,    
and putting its articulation in the utterings of Raphael Hythloday, a   
character whose name etymologically (and loosely, I believe) may be     
translated as "bringer of health/babbler of nonsense." Equivocal at the     
least.

Dear Cass:     
    
I was thinking about your recent post, and about Jack this a.m.     
as I made the bed. About "the human", partly because I have to teach    
Foucault and Derrida tonight to a group of undergraduates, partly   
because I was trying to come up with a name for what Jack so 
generously offered those lucky enough to work with him. And, for me     
anyway, "human" is it. This, I guess, is one of those key sites where   
I find myself at odds with those Euro-guys. I mean the notion that the  
human is over. When, from an "Ohio" point of view (I guess you could    
read "Emerson" here), the problem is we have yet to realize the human,  
except in very rare cases.    
    
Best,

UC San Diego, San Francisco State, Brown, Sonoma, Simon Frazer, Albany

programs.  That's about 30 LPs versus ____ .  Can anyone fill in the    
blank?     
    
Well, there are slightly over 260 programs in the US (plus whatever more    
in Canada, which has a population somewhere between California and      
Texas), and I might be inclined to add Penn, UC Santa Cruz, Wayne State,    
University of Alabama and a few other schools, but really what      
constitutes "infiltration"? I think that virtually ALL of the New   
American Poetry branches, not just langpo, acquire a significant amount     
of their weight and moral authority precisely by virtue of their being a    
literature of the urban writing scenes rather than of the campus. And of    
the 40 poets in In the American Tree, only 5 or 6 (depending on whether     
Fanny Howe has tenure at UCSD, which I'm not clear on) have ever had    
tenure. Of those, one is retired (Bromige) and another (Andrews) has    
tenure in political science.      
    
I wonder how Paul Hoover feels at (1) being asked to stand as the incon     
for langpo in the NY Times and (2) being described there basically as an    
unintelligible man w/ tenure, which his school (Columbia College in     
Chicago) does not even offer?? or Leslie (a lurker here, I believe)     
likewise, who has been so clear for so many years that her relationship     
to the basic langpo traits has been that of friendly critic and whose   
summer job at Bard similarly cannot count as that major tenured job     
alluded to?    
    
The value of the NY Times piece seems to me to come precisely from its  
wrong-headedness. I.e., the NY Times is willing to put forward an index     
of how out of it the journal really is.   
    
One further thought: Larry Bensky on KPFA the other morning (talking up     
the series on the first 100 days of the republican administration that  
he's doing w/ Juliane Malveaux on the Pacifica Radio Network) virtually     
mapped to the Apex of the M argument in saying that, to paraphrase,     
"Newt Gingrich's band of republicans are like Language Poets. They talk     
about government out of context and in that denatured light, everyone   
can imagine it as Other, as alien, rather than as the collective    
expression of the will of the people."    
    
Sigh.

You make a good point about (not) generalizing about ALL women.  Another    
implicit assumption seems to be that when one says man or woman on this list,   
one means hetero man & woman.  I don't want to generalize, but I do want to 
speak.     
    
And we seem to be talking here; this list seems more speechlike than any    
other discourse I'm familiar with, a cocktail party as nada said.  And speech   
is the wonderful land of generalizations, big ideas expressed in a few words.   
    
    
How should we speak about gender and biology?   Binary is right out.  How   
many genders are there?

Rather than post multiple messages... 
    
Cass, thank you for that last post. You know John Thorpe's work? I grew     
up in California, lived in the Bay Area 10 years, not once did I hear   
Thorpe's name mentioned, read anything anyone had to say about him. I   
move out here to Minneapolis-St. Paul, no longer have a scene to rely on    
to suggest "what to read"--voila! I discover Thorpe's books in used     
bookstores. _Exogeny_, _The Cargo Cult_, _Five Aces & Independence_, then   
Spencer Selby graciously gives me his copy of _Matter_. He's become one     
of my favorite living poets (I assume he's still alive), have learned   
much from his work. No one writes about him these days, maybe never wrote   
about him. He didn't make it easy for the critics. No cliff note    
manifestos, not even anything (so far as I know) about other poets, never   
wrote a book review, even. The fact that he was (again, so far as I know)   
unaffiliated didn't help, I'm sure.   
    
Other interesting discoveries made only after I moved out of the bay    
area: Well, the second most important for me was Philip Whalen. I   
discover, lately, that Scalapino at least wrote about the guy, a short  
treatment of his work that wound up in her Potes & Poets book of    
criticism. Thanks, Leslie. I literally never heard his name mentioned,  
nor did I see any of his work, until I moved out here.   
    
"New Hope for the Disappeared" Ron? Nice that you'd write about Ceravolo    
when you did, I thought your piece on his work in _The New Sentence_ was    
swell. But, what's the common thread among these poets who's work we have   
to *hunt* for? They didn't go public with their manifestos, theoretical     
insights, etc. Thorpe is obviously a brilliant thinker: you couldn't    
write _Five Aces_ "off the cuff"; obviously a *lot* of thought & planning   
went into that book. Why haven't we any critics willing to write about  
it? Is it simply easier to take a poet who *has* said a few public words    
about his/her writing and write about him/her?   
    
That, Marjorie, was the feeling I got, reading your _Radical Artifice_. I   
thought the book was good, but was surprised that, in a book that had, as   
subtitle, "Poetry Writing in the Age of Media" that you not once    
mentioned Bern Porter, who I imagine was, if not the first, certainly one   
of the first American poets to use & address--not exclusively, but      
close--the media in his work. My suspicion was that you'd never heard of    
Porter--quite likely as most of his books were self-published. (As      
opposed to paying, say, Station Hill to publish 'em.) No distribution,  
save Bookslinger (found a mountain of his books there). SPD doesn't carry   
'em. What you say in your last post about wanting or enoying only   
carrying on discussions with people you know suggests the possible reason   
so much of _Radical Artifice_ seemed to be about Sun & Moon authors-you     
are, after all, on their Advisory Board. It seems to me, if you're      
talking to the same people all the time to the exclusion of people you  
don't know, you'll perhaps bring a very limited body of work to your    
critical writing. If I'd not've moved out of the bay area, would I ever     
have discovered John Thorpe? I'm admittedly a very impressionable person    
and moving out here was great for me as it forced me to do my own hunting   
around for poetry, etc.       
    
Charles, thanks for the footnote re: Raphael Hythloday. More's wonderful.   
I'm sorry I missed Lazer's lecture & reading, and the lunch at your     
house. I've been sick with the flu, only starting to recouperate. I hope    
it all went well.  
    
Maybe it's just because I'm new to this, but I really appreciate getting    
loads of e-mail, especially when they include names of poets I've not   
heard of before, or composers, & addresses as to where one might find   
this stuff. Thanks to Mark Nowak for much of that. I also *enjoy* some of   
the more "personal" posts--thank both Kali and Sheila E. for theirs,    
especially, as well as Cass's. I think it's great that the language poets   
have been receiving whatever recognition they've received, but I do think   
that, undoubtedly unintentionally, a lot of other work's being lost or  
forgotten in the process. As lineages are mapped out & recognized (you  
all realize the Loft, here in MPLS-STPL, is a terribly conservative     
writing institution, but that when it did make a single nod to      
"exploratory" poetries decided to do a class on language writing, as    
though that's "all she wrote") unaffiliateds & those who never made     
public the ideas & concerns that went into the "creative" work *except*     
in the creative work, are being forgotten, erased.  I'll leave you all  
with something from Mina Loy. It's somewhat self-righteous, but     
appropriate enough:    
    
SHOW ME A SAINT WHO SUFFERED      
    
Show me a saint who suffered in humility;    
I will show you one and again another 
who suffered more and in deeper humility  
than he.   
    
I who have lived among many of the unfortunate   
claim that of the martyr to have been 
a satisfactory career, his agony  
being well-advertised.    
    
Is not the sacrifice of security to renown       
conventional for the heroic?      
The common tragedy is to have suffered    
without having "appeared."    
    
    
PS: Ron, I guess it was a drag not to've been mentioned in Dinitia      
Smith's _Times_ article under the grouping of language poets (none of   
whom were, of course, language poets). Now you know how I felt when I   
picked up a copy of your _N/O_ and saw that you'd forgotten to      
acknowledge _Stifled Yawn_ as one of the magazines who'd published some     
of that work (the first 4 pages of "NON" as you'll recall). Sigh, indeed.

I noticed that the House committee on appropriations voted to cut CPB and   
NPR by 15 percent this year, 30 next, much smaller cuts than they   
anticipated from this particularly hostile committee. I'd expect to see     
the same for the Endowments. A hopeful sign.     
    
On the less hopeful side, I quote from a discussion of "The English     
Poetry Full-Text Database," a 4-CD set that includes, says the author,  
the complete life works of roughly 1,250 poets. Of this, says the author,   
    
"But who are they all? How many poets could you list off the cuff? I sat    
down for half an hour, scratched my brain [nice mixed metaphor      
there--RS], and got as far as a lousy fifty-five."   
    
This from page 102 of the Feb 20/27 double issue of the New Yorker, by  
Anthony Lane. Maybe he studied with Dinitia Smith.   
    
Obviously, in NYC's "mainstream" media when it comes to the  
knowledge-base for reporting on the topic of verse, less is more.   
    
It does make for tidier narratives. Which may be how Mark Strand made 4     
separate lists in the Times, including "best-looking males."

Marjorie:      
    
Other missing material from _Radical Artifice_:      
    
Daniel Davidson's book _Product_, published by e.g. press in 1991. Anyone   
who has read both your _RA_ and _Product_ can tell you why it should've     
been included. A full-frontal assault on advertising/P.R., the most     
successful I've ever read, which is why my wife & I published it.   
Probably you never heard about the book because, when my wife (Marta    
Deike) and I took over the press in 1989, it was something of the   
laughingstock of the west coast language writing scene, though its      
original editor, David Highsmith had published a book of David Bromige's    
and Todd Baron's. He also published (the unmittegated gall!) a lot of   
people who weren't in that particular scene.     
    
e.g. was so thoroughly detested by language writers that Todd Baron took    
the manuscript he'd had published through e.g. (_Partials_) and got O   
Books to publish it--without acknowledging that e.g. had been the   
original publisher. I assume the fact that the people in your general   
circle think so poorly of the press is why none of them bothered to tell    
you about Dan's book--even despite the fact that Dan is very much a     
"language" writer (see his work in Ganick's anthology). I'll send a copy    
of __Product_ if you like; just let me know.     
    
Also missing, of course, is the work David Ossman's done: especially his    
_How Time Flies_. As pointed as anything in _The Baffler_ re: the   
entertainment industry, and recorded in 1973.  Why you chose to write   
about Lyn Hejinian's _My Life_ in the context of "Writing Poetry in the     
Age of Media" to the neglect of these other things is precisely what has    
me questioning your motivation, as well as your sources for information.    
    
Someone just mentioned that Charles Bernstein's to be thanked for setting   
this list up, and for keeping it open to any & all, including       
loudmouthed, opinionated malcontents like myself (& a few others). Yes.     
Lovely thing this; one can question people, challenge them, and have it     
somewhat public, "on record." Much better than a magazine, as, you write    
something negative about language poetry for, say, Rod Smith's magazine,    
it gets rejected. (I'm referring to Alan Davies' uneven, but certainly  
provocative, "Peer Pleasure," which has been passed around among poets  
since having been rejected by _Aerial_.)  
    
Charles? When I first read the piece you wrote for Bernadette Mayer's   
_Utopia_, I thought you disingenuous, given the sometimes exclusionary  
tactics of (at least) the west coast language poets & affiliateds. You of   
course know, and probably better than I do, how Johanna Drucker was     
treated by 'em. At any rate, I no longer think that; am really glad     
you've made this space available. This is truly "reader response."      
    
Finally.

Marjorie and Kali and B. Cass and other women speaking up on this subject   
may have more in common with Alan Golding, Tom Mandel, and other men than   
they do with each other on any of a variety of subjects. Being a woman  
does not insure agreement anymore than men agree. The women's movement  
sought agreement or at least support along gender lines, but doesn't even   
within this narrow group appear to hold when personal identity and      
aesthitic issues are raised. Poets dont agree, men don't agree, women   
don't agree and neither does anyone else. We are all tender in parts and    
I hope will persevere even if we don't agree.

Comment:  In so far as "I"  is  constructing itself in an    
"imaginary", yes [ or, okey-dokey].  But that takes us into a       
Lacanian vocabulary that may be going too far too soon for

enough to begin to admit it as a base for theory.   POINT TAKEN.    
Thank you for bringing it up.

"The issue which has been mentioned several times here is    
that of voicing, reading out loud  -  which seems crucial to this   
discussion. It makes a useful bridge (I'm always up for building 'em) to    
issues of composition and to oral - improvisatory traditions and innovative 
oral - improvisatory 'practice' (surely it's always practice, however   
'accomplished it gets - that's its edge which admits process - is process   
an institution?)"  
    
Comment:  Oral emission, but not necessarily composed by "internal"     
speech-like thinkings, i.e.improvisatory irruptions.  Aural  
reception, -- but like John Geraets was saying, deaf people may well    
read poems --, would be more appropriately thought of as aural      
"imagination".  Without a lot of caution over this, I'd be      
bothered by locking poetry into varieties of opsycho-babble from the    
old surrealist depths, and disallowing the constructed "language"   
based rather than "speech" based poetries to which Lang-Po was much     
attached in the 70's and 80's (or so it seemed to me, and as I      
thought usefully).

Marjorie and others in this loop:     
I have had several conversations recently regarding control on the      
listserv. On the one hand we don't want to tell anyone what to say;     
clearly censorship is not a good idea. On the other hand there are a lot    
of personal discussions made public and "exhibitionists" contrast with  
"lurkers" vying for the same mental space.       
    
Based on backchannel discussions with some other people I would make two    
recommendations based on my own difficulties and others concurrence with    
these difficulties, not the least of which is Marjorie's complaint.     
Perhaps these will form the basis of discussion.     
    
1. Perhaps Loss can subdivide the list into two parts. Part one can be  
for listings of events, newsletters, and exchanges of bibliographical   
information. Part two can be a discussion list where people can express     
their individual views collectively.  
2. Without making any rules, perhaps people could keep personal notes and   
conspiritorial exchanges to the back channel. I don't want to point any     
fingers here, but there are a lot of short notes thatdon't really add to    
the discussion and are also directed at only one other person. That     
constitutes back channel material to me. This would solve what many of us   
feel are messages which "clog up" our bulletin board. Obviously personal    
exchanges can be used to "inform" the group. This trope which is    
developing nicely is an effective, but not particularly attractive      
technique. That's the kind of thing we might consider doing without, but    
it has to be applied by each individual and might be considered     
acceptable under conditions which each individual anywhere on the   
spectrum from "lurker" to "exhibitor" has to judge for themselves.      
    
These two changes might make it easier to go through the list and to find   
what we each want to look at without having to wade through 40 or more  
messages over a weekend. I'd appreciate discussion on these matters.

Hi Marjorie, it's just yet another rejoinder to your post about post.   
Suffice to say, and many would testify, I have down several years been the  
most non-existent correspondent almost anybody could have wished for. My    
letters barely ever crossed a mat. BUT    
    
I like e-mail and am pretty active with it. I find when I sit down to write 
letters I feel that I'm engaging in an old-school type 'proper' 'literary'  
activity. The sort of thing that might one day be published by some trust.  
I value the transitory aspect of this. Don't you find that conversation is  
full of 'throw-away, personal little bits'? One minute you're humming with  
excitement of discovery through detailed exchange - the next boiling a  
kettle for a cup of tea (sorry that's very Anglo-centric of me I know)? But 
the drift is clear.    
E-mail feels more like post cards might have done to me, if I'd ever posted 
the ones that I bought. Letters always felt like serious writing whereas I  
find this space as Tom Mandel described it to be 'a pleasant whirlwind' in  
which a variety of agendas appear to circle and sample each other with some 
variety of speeds of address and attention. The cafe, the bar, the club,    
the coffee break at the conference, the chance encounter between the    
supermarket shelves, the heated discussion in the corner shop, the after    
hours philosophising and more all seems to breand here. I'm curious - it's  
seems full of new potential. It feels like a localised conversation of  
distances. I'm trying to keep myself open to change through the process.    
And I'm probably giving it as much time as I should have given to writing   
letters in the past. But I get a lot more post and get to meet people I     
might never otherwise have known. What's the problem?    
    
feel it needs devaluing because  . . . ?

Hi Tony, yes I realise I'm treading a fine line when it comes to the dances 
of tongues in a mouth.    
I'm all for the 'oral emission' of extremely un-speech-like constructed     
language and the speech-like things (Burroughs is one of the great      
vaudeville vocal performers). I'd love to hear P. Inman read. Tom Raworth   
is the most energising and compelling reader here on this port off the  
pond. Many of the lang'shan-po are strong readers. I'd bring other aural    
imaginative strategies such as Jackson MacLow and Hannah Weiner and very    
very much enjoy what Carla Harryman and Steve Benson have done and are  
doing in terms of memory and improvisation in performance. I'd bring    
Michael Smith with his dub song-poem 'My cyaan believe it', Jean Binta  
Breeze, Linton Kwesi Johnson  - many many more across into the music more   
direct Tribe Called Quest 'When the Papes Come'. I'd bring Schwitters' 'Ur  
Sonata' and Ernst Jandl and Chopin and Cobbing and the 4 Horsemen of the    
Apocalypse and many others  - Jerry Rothenberg performing Frank Mitchell's  
'Horse Songs'. All of these people (it's only a tip off a scratch) work     
with aural / oral invention and imagination. All of this work is    
constructed - 'language under pressure'.  
As to 'the old surrealist depths' I remember jotting down a quote of    
Margaret Thatcher's "I will delve deeply into the surface of things" -  
seems to take care of that. She should have recorded 'Feelings' it would    
have been sincere. 
    
Any thoughts ?

Subject:  Re: Boy Talk    
    
Delurking /Delousing/Coming Clean     
    
Having only joined the poetics list a short time ago, I have followed the   
gender trouble (let's get out of the old binaries of boys vs girls at   
least) discussion with great interest.  It seems that the concurrent    
discussion on the relationship between theory and practice would be more    
interesting if it passed beyond rather than below the abstract limbo    
stick to speak in terms of greater specificity-which aspects of practice    
have been institutionalized, which aspects are still excluded from the  
academies, can this be linked to trends in pedagogic practice such as the   
teaching of certain theories over others or how they are taught in      
relation to poetry.  I have appreciated the comments of Kali Tal (hello     
Kali!) as well as all the other women who have contextualized gender problems on
poetics list from their own perspective.  
    
At this point, I would like to "delurk" and try to articulate my own    
politics of location.  I am a Melbournian doctoral student (with no     
affiliation with A=R=I=T=M=E=T=R=I=C=K and who has eaten lanolin-free   
Hokey Pokey icecream and lived to tell the tale) who is researching ways in 
which contemporary poetry contributes to feminist cultural practice.  I     
also teach a course on postmodernism which has such items as the Hoover     
anthology and Laurie Anderson on its syllabus.  I am interested in the  
challenge that the internet offers both in terms of poetic community    
formation and discursive horizons.    
    
It is not surprising that the net creates its own disciplinization and  
exclusion effects; rather we should be asking how these can be changed.     
Although statistics are the fool's creditcard, my information was that  
women make up only 5% of the population who use the net.  So the poetics    
list is obviously attracting women to enter its space.  The question then   
arises as to which women and how they engage with the net both as a     
medium and as a practice. Being Australian, I am speaking on the margins    
as a not-so-dutiful daughter to the many on the list who are or have been   
associated with Language poetry in one way or another. Yet, as part of  
the university, access to the list was easier for me than it is for many    
Australian women who are interested in contemporary poetry and poetics  
but who feel isolated.  The net is one way in which such isolation can be   
dissolved.     
    
From my Asian-Pacific position, I cannot contribute to matters      
of US funding and I feel that much of what is discussed on the poetics  
list has a localized politics of which I am uninformed.  However, I feel    
that such a connection is invaluable-whether taken up in more active ways   
or not(my lurking is not necessarily passive and can be tactical).  I am    
therefore content to "listen in on" than query much of what goes on in  
the list. That's all I'll say for now if not just for another voice and     
two cents in the debate.      
    
Thanks,

P.S.  Given that most ocker slang derives from a cockney origin, perhaps    
it is fitting that our convict past has furnished us with the world's

Subject:  community request   
    
I'm grateful to Ron Silliman for propelling me to this list back in     
December.  I've lurked, feeling peripheral, but have a request I'd like     
your help with.    
    
One story about the value of poetry says that its meaning is like the   
meaning of money:  not an intrinsic value, only a value of exchange.  The   
greater the community-building involved, the more valuable the poetry   
which is the basis of that exchange.  I learned this idea in fact from  
Ron, though my formulation is not his, I don't think.    
    
I'd like to consider this idea, now, more seriously, and am hoping that     
some of you will have suggestions for me of things to read, problems to     
grapple with, other issues.   
    
The context for my question is that I'm interested in doing a       
nearly-sociological study of how poetry is actually used (in the specimen   
case of the Washington DC area, though I'd hope with relevance to other     
physical communities).  There's an anxiety I suppose everybody writing  
poetry has grappled with, about the value to others of the enterprise,  
and it seems to me that if there were some new ways of talking about the    
varied applications and, I guess you could say, "community-significances"   
of the poems themselves it might be useful.      
    
So I'm pretty shamelessly asking for help, asking to pick your brains on    
this.      
    
Since so few of you know me at all either in person or by name, I should    
say by way of intro that, having done a PhD dissertation (1975) on      
Oppen's poetry, I am teaching, and have been since 1974, at George      
Washington University in DC.      
    
A postscript:  I've broken silence finally because the gender issues being  
raised, as well as the issues of time and focus raised by Marjorie Perloff  
and others, seem to focus on the status of this list too as a community,    
and I thought perhaps you might all be already really thinking of this  
subject.   
    
Thanks -- David McAleavey

Sometimes you just go through deleting everything that isn't 
by someone whom you feel you must read in each address, and  
that's just the way it is. It is not necessary to digest 
completely what's on a listserv to get something out of it   
and to find it possible to give something to it. Other times,       
less often to be sure, one reads each post carefully - that's       
the way you want to spend your time that time.   
    
I don't think there's anything to do, either, about people   
getting excited and dashing off fuzzy paragraphs to each 
other. My sense is that imposing an order of division or 
of personal discipline will not change anything.     
    
It is true that the number of posts is daunting, especially  
if god forbid you take off 3-4 days. I do wish, but there's  
nothing to do to make it so, that people would think thru    
what they are about to say; if it really doesn't amount  
to much, it's always possible to wait for another day.

I agree with James about dividing the list into two categories, and it would    
appear that category #2 (discussions of issues) will simply require the sort    
of judgment which several people are urging that people use in the present  
list.  A matter of consideration for others.  Let's go with the plan.

Everyone who has commented on this list about the NY Times Magazine     
article on poetry by Dinitia Smith has laughed at or otherwise critized     
the treatment of language poetry, and the choices used to represent it. I   
agree entirely, but I must admit that the article made me consider that     
its treatment of other issues in poetry, such as cronyism, awards to    
friends, control by Academy of American Poets, etc., a treatment with   
which I might find myself in agreement, must have been equally      
ridiculous. I don't know if I applaud Stephen for "turning off the lite"    
and not reading it, or if I think there was a curious delight in reading    
something so totally ludicrous.   
    
As to James Sherry's suggestion about dividing into two lists, I'm not so   
sure. I have responded and become involved in conversations where posts     
seemed private. I also would wonder about decisions as to an "a" and a  
"b" list. I greatly value the growing divergence of views, particularly     
as represented in "boy talk" posts and in Gary Sullivan's energetic,    
thoughtful, and informative posts, some of which are directed personally    
at Marjorie or Charles or Mark or me or others (Thanks, Gary, for   
information on John Thorpe, whose work I don't know, and for making my  
picture of "e.g." more clear). I have found value in many of your posts,    
James, which were ostensibly responses to specific individuals and      
addressed to them as such. I liked the characterization of   
this floating conversation nexus as Cris Cheek put it -- 
"I find this space as Tom Mandel described it to be 'a pleasant whirlwind' in   
which a variety of agendas appear to circle and sample each other with some 
variety of speeds of address and attention. The cafe, the bar, the club,    
the coffee break at the conference, the chance encounter between the    
supermarket shelves, the heated discussion in the corner shop, the after    
hours philosophising and more all seems to breand here. I'm curious - it's  
seems full of new potential. It feels like a localised conversation of  
distances."    
    
Let's keep the whilrwind moving. If there was a division into two areas,    
I could see a value in one part being posts of conferences, lists of    
available books, and no conversation whatsoever, and the other being the    
conversations, no matter how widely or narrowly directed, no matter how     
central or tangential they seem to the list as a whole.  
    
    all best,

That's no news about the giant tapeworm fopund in Buffalo; Benji has    
been, to literary people, known for years. Chas Bernstein raised    
benji since he was a pup, and a truer pet was never known. Charles      
even brought Benji to a conference in Calgary 2 years ago, and it is    
no easy thing to being a half-grown tapeworm across the canadian    
border. The poets converged in Calgary took to Benji, and fed him; in   
fact they vied for the opportunity to feed him. Benji is particularly   
fond of Lacanian case histories.

This scribe called Lang Po that I occasionally hear about here---is

Li Po, as many know, drank some, and in fact drowned while reaching     
into a stream for the reflection of a basketball.

In-Reply-To:  <199502221528.AA22274@mailhub.cc.columbia.edu> 
    
Hello "everyone"-- 
    
I'm tuning in kind of late here on the boy-talk/theory thread, but in   
response to Gary Sullivan's observation that Mina Loy, Gertrude Stein, and  
Djuna Barnes didn't "provide separate bodies of critical writings,"  I  
feel that I must point out that (depending of course on how we are      
defining bodies here!) Mina Loy did. In the mid twenties she felt so    
compelled to draw out the theoretical implications of Stein's aesthetic     
that she pressed the word 'deconstruction' into circulation-- this was in   
Ford's transatlantic.  And I think the entire notion of 'deconstruction'    
(in the parisian, sixties ense of the word) was intelligible to her     
because of the way her sense of sex politics shaped her aesthetic from  
the beginning.     
    
Gary Sullivan's observation interests me though because it leads me to  
wonder-- what "counts" as theory?  If I can use Barnes' article about how   
it feels to be forcibly fed (as she allowed herself to be, in sympathy  
for the British suffragists) as a way of reading her work, then doesn't     
it stand as theory? Maybe these writers theorized in ways that are still    
invisible to too many of us. (That comment really is a general one, and     
not directed against Gary Sullivan, who raised the question well)   
    
I think it was Naomi Schor who figured out that Freud didn't believe    
women could theorize.... that what we supposedly do instead is construct    
paranoid observations based on the repressed or projected (but in any case, 
apparently intellectually stifling) experience of our own bodies...Loy  
was forced to write an epic in response to this sort of thing.      
    
More in a minute!

e-mail address is alauterb@du.edu     
    
I'll give her your correct e-mail address tomorrow, but I wasnted to    
be sure that she was added as soon as possible.      
Many thanks!   
    
p.s. Please tell Susan Howe that her students at Denver miss her.

...Hello again,    
    
It was unimaginative of me, I know, but I couldn't figure out how to    
connect the Girl-talk/theory thread with Kenneth Koch... which leads to     
the question I would like, in all seriousness, to ask: does he have     
female readers?  I am very interested in the relative lack of discussion    
about New York School poets (a few exceptions aside) at conferences, and    
here too.  Tenney Nathanson brought up the lineage question (what did   
they do that hasn't been picked up by language poets) and the *question     
itself* wasn't even picked up.  I'm wondering if it's in part because of    
the apparent sexual politics of, for instance, Koch's stories (and his  
ART OF LOVE).  Or is it a generational blind spot?   
    
KK is about to turn 70 (!), and a celebration reading/performance is    
being planned for March 23, 7:00PM, in New York City.... yours truly is     
curating the food.  Anyone interested in participating in some way, or  
anyone wishing more information, can contact me at <jma5@columbia.edu>.     
    
Meanwhile I continue to admire his recent two collections with a lot of     
unanswered questions surfing the brain.   
    
Has anyone else picked up Anne Porter's work, by the way?  I'm not sure     
she would have wide appeal among members of the list, but I was surprised   
and moved by her stuff, the way I was when I first found Schuyler.      
    
that's all she wrote

I'm confused, not having seen James' post about dividing the list into  
categories. What's the proposal? How will it work? Who is going to decide   
what is and what isn't an issue? It looks a very slippery slope to me!  
Not having been able to read what must have been a serious discussion I'm   
curious as to what the benefits can be. And isn't it true that sometimes    
hot issues emerge from the pan-handling of what appears to be nothing more  
than playful chit-chat? Jokes and deliberate (nay wilful) misunderstandings 
can provide unexpected impetus for flight / engagement. But is this more an 
instance of net flight -, establishing a compound safe from the rabble at   
the gates?

I'm with Chris Cheek, and think "dividing" the list wd only "multiply"  
the problem.   
    
One firm suggestion: puh-lease send private notes privately. This alone     
wd make the list easier to handle. Moreover, if a discussion turns out  
to be between you and one or two other folks, send messages among   
yourselves if you can bear not to place your message before this    
public.    
    
That was more than one suggestion. Here's a final one: consider     
carefully whether the funny remark you are about entropize electrons    
with is really likely to be so received among the several dozen other   
puns on hokeypokey, etc. (I am sure I am as guilty as anyone, btw).     
    
Restraint in these areas would lighten the load, clarify the focus      
of the list, and make my life at least a little easier to manage    
in this particular.    
    
But, lets not divide a thing all the same.

Subject:  That Talmudic Range     
    
The exraordinary intellectual stimulation of Talmudic study comes from  
the need to try to develop logical or linear coherence out of the record    
of an oral conversation -- topics in the Talmud move easily from    
questions of Shabbat practice to the issue of whether or not giving the     
infant oatmeal will make it stop crying....  (Of course, study of Talmud    
is an oral practice of the study of an oral text, despite all that      
emphasis about being "of the book"....).  
Let's keep our richness on the poetics list and not divide it.

chris, about the "transitory" nature of this stuff:  unlike paper, it's

james:  to discuss what to do with this list (and your suggestion really    
amounts to starting yet another list) in these parts is to introduce another    
meta-thread INTO this discussion!... this is ok with me, but i'm sure you   
see that what you've done is created another topos that is likely (witness  
my post, THIS POST) to cause another little stir...  
    
by which i mean to say that EVERY list will go through this sorta thing...  
even if this list bifurcates, it's very likely that somebody down the line  
will propose what amounts to a change in direction (up to and including     
another list)... though your suggestion SOUNDS tidier, i doubt that it  
will prevent public service announcements (if you will) from being posted   
ultimately to BOTH lists...   
    
just my two bits on this... spin-offs of all sorts are always a possibility,

i was walking by the elementary school the other day, near-west

     I promise you pleasure but I give you pain..."  
    
& so on.  i've seen it, or versions of it, before.  doggeral.

i wouldn't be surprised if it had more readers than any of the      
latest from sun & moon.       
    
i sat down in the arcade to eat my lunch last week, some kid 
had left their notebook--study hall notes, doodles, and a    
coupla poems she wrote...     
    
when i was setting up the In-Yr-Ear poetry hotline a while   
back, i went to radio shack to buy an answering machine.  the       
salesman was a big yeats fan.  then, when i went to the print       
shop to get business cards made up, the grandmotherly woman  
at the counter admitted she write poems, "but i never showed 
'em to anybody."

university affiliated presses, much less major publishers... 
and i cleared out the studio of backlog about a year ago 
    
i'm mentioning all this, 'cause the common knowledge is that the    
"communities" for poetries are various factions--iowa workshop,     
langpo, multiculti...--that have in common a schooled self-  
awareness, and a self-definition that stands in relation to  
"the mainstream", either in it or forcably excluded from it. 
what yr talking about studying sounds like it might be able  
to consider the place of poetry in communities in a larger   
sense, beyond what's usually considered appropriate.  hope   
so, anyway.

Subject:  Re: More in re: Radical Artifice   
    
I do just want to respond a little to Gary Sullivan's remarks about     
Marjorie Perloff's _Radical Artifice_, perhaps also in the context of   
the girl/boy/tone discussion which, as an anti-rape activist, a consistent  
grader of girls higher than boys in my classes, and a co-editor of a    
British anthology of contemporary experimental women's poetry, I continue   
to find Kali Tal wrongly putting me on the wrong "side" of.  
    Let me say first off that I agree with Gary Sullivan that Daniel    
Davidson's _Product_ is a wonderful, brilliant work, so as to assure him    
that I am not hiding a partisan agenda underneath my comments. More on  
_Product_ in a minute. I happen to also think that _Radical Artifice_ is    
a wonderful, brilliant work too - please let me add that I do usually   
use such terms of real esteem sparingly. I always read Marjorie Perloff's   
writing wherever I can find it. Many of her books mark and back up a    
critical moment, usually in sea-changes in literary academic trends, and    
they do so in such a language that they succeed (in my experience) in   
appealing to the kind of mindset and rhetoric of correctness that most  
academics do have, and, having got their ear, pour a little of the present  
into it. Put more simply, Marjorie Perloff has always seemed to me to be    
the kind of rare and invaluable university teacher who actually keeps   
*updating the syllabus*, putting new books on; and what I'm trying to say   
about her critical prose style is that I think it is very effective in  
appealing to very static unchanging teachers to also update their syllabus. 
It's hard to say how, but I think it's because she awakens the sense    
of seriousness that academics should have, and usually only have in their   
inflated sense of themselves. She writes, in my opinion, given this audience,   
with brilliant cajoling rhetoric.     
    This is important work, and much more likely to succeed in getting  
teachers to update their syllabus, than different kinds of rhetoric; for    
example, huge sweeping generalisations against academia in general. I hope  
that it might be appreciated as a subtlety that I applaud this in Marjorie  
Perloff, even though I myself prefer vainglorious sweeping generalisations  
against academia in general. I cannot but, after all, acknowledge the   
reality; that her method works, and is professional, mine doesn't, and is   
done out of selfish pleasure and despair. I hope Kalil might appreciate     
that if I draw attention to myself by saying this, it is also to welcome    
criticism.     
    The book is called _Radical Artifice_. Might not this be seen as    
also describing itself, without quite so much rancor? Like all books, it has    
authors it wishes to discuss, one, and wants to inaugurate a whole new  
area of study, two: in this case, poetry and media, poetry as media. Of     
course there won't be a tidy fit, that's what Perloff argues for all the#   
authors she discusses. Instead, it has an elegant surface, and, to quote a  
phrase, throws down the gauntlet: go ahead and top this, with different     
authors, different critical footholds, and rival me for prose style, why    
don't you? I myself find this kind of confident stylishness really      
exhilarating.  
    If anything, _Radical Artifice_, taken as a part of a body of work, 
moving from discussing Lowell and O'Hara, opening territory with Cage and   
with futurism, shows a questing writer moving through and against the   
dominat avant-garde of the sixties and seventies, and finally producing     
her most assured and "this is my moment" work; or, as Cage found, switching 
from being a strongly opinionated and ambitious student of the art seeking  
out and talking to those she esteems, to becoming someone others will   
esteem. In this, Perloff's journey, as I'm putting it, resembles and indeed 
illuminates the Language Writers, who are after all critics as well as  
poets, more as one of them than anything else. For me anyway, reading all   
of Perloff's much more readily available books helped me to find a way  
into Language Writing, both its "forms" and, more importantly, the culture, 
the history of opposition, its writers come from.    
    So that it seems to me to be too harsh and mudthrowing to attack    
her work in this way. Yes, there is a Sun & Moon connection, but as I am    
suggesting that would be more understandable if Perloff was seen as a kinf  
kind of poet-critic. Donald Davie, in England, does just the same, and  
is attacked just the same, in writing his books mainly about poets from     
a press on which he is an editor. But, for Heaven's sake, isn't this a  
way of a critic putting money where the mouth is: not just writing about    
groundbreaking writing of the past, but trying to get current groundbreakers    
into print, and read? Pound would have thought so. And just as Pound and    
Davie, Perloff has her favourites: Thank God, a criticism motivated by  
pleasure and excitement and a feel of radical energy, instead of politcal   
correctness!   
    This is why, as a gender-conscious writer, I am reluctant to enter  
the discussion about gender we've been having; if I criticise any writer,   
it is on non-sexist grounds, and yet in such an atmosphere, it won't be     
seen that way. If I do have reservations about Perloff's writing, it is     
that writers she dislikes (eg Larkin) get attacked in a way that seems to   
use very big weapons (MacKinnon-like psychoanalytic equating of pathetic    
male bravado as evidence of ... well, actually, self-hatred in a man who    
didn't actually do much real harm to all the people he privately and    
rhetorically fumed at; being part of New Criticism, when he hated academic  
dissection of work; being "fascist" - sic - for fantasising the destruction 
of all high culture, in favour of low culture; how can "fascist" mean   
anything then, when Pound wanted the reverse of Larkin and is also fascist? 
    
And reservation two would be, but this is not uncommon on this list, that   
Perloff gives so little time to anarchist thinking - and Davidson's Product 
seems to me to a very anarchistic book, in the sense of Prince Kropotkin    
and Colin Ward. As with a lot of the writers she discusses, the politics    
are often statist socialism, and the rhetoric harsh enough to storm the     
bastille with. Davidson's is angry, but also not wanting to be President.   
Again, I don't think either approach is wrong, and again, looked at     
realistically, statist radicalism energises more people, and energised  
people in a state of change is not to be sniffed at. But I would, certainly,    
like to see Perloff continue to be a fascinating and impassioned critic     
writing very publically, and find some room - as Davie does sometimes -     
to appraise a writer with a very different strategy almost as if it was     
worth believing in. Even if she doesn't, she's still a writer I will    
always read, annoyed or not. I missed this sense of acknowledgement in  
the attack on her. She's not the enemy, she's the energising rival.     
Emotionally one may be provoked by her critical skill and wish it were  
directed at one's own favourites - precisely because it's good prose. Product   
is a good favourite to have, a good thing to have an emotion about, but     
I suggest that, only by humbly honouring what is good about each other,     
will we see that good prose written about our own favourites - by writing   
in emulation of a powerful (female) contemporary, ourselves.

I'm very worried that Chris is correct here; that what we might be talking

but could be the result. I've seen stuff happen like this on lists before,  
ie, someone complains about "the overload of irrelevancies," asks for more  
"discipline," and what makes lists fun and important, the spontaneity,  
the misunderstandings that lead to more productive posts, vanish.   
 But hey, this comes from perhaps one of those "exhibitionists,"    
maybe? Maybe in some way that obviates my remarks?

Subject:  Poetry in the community 
    
David McAleavey is way too modest. He's been a fine poet for at least 25    
years that I know of and can take credit for having published, via Ithaca   
House Press, the first books of yours truly, Bob Perelman, and David    
Melnick, as well as Ray DiPalma's second (Soli). In fact, I met Ray first   
through that connection back when Ray still taught at Bowling Green in  
Ohio. McAleavey is also the man who taught me to play chess, but that's     
another story.     
    
When I ran a writers workshop in the Tenderloin in SF (1979-81),    
something on the order of 250 different people would attend one or more     
sessions, usually with work in hand, over the course of a year. (There  
was a core group of maybe 40 people, 25 of whom could be counted on to  
show up every week.) They ranged in age from 14 to upper 70s (one had   
been a student of Zukofsky's at SF State in '58), all races, sexual     
orientations (there were at least 6 represented), lifestyles, as they   
say. Some, like Bob Harrison (Hi, Bob), Marsha Campbell and Mary    
Tallmountain have done considerable publishing. One fellow (I'm blanking    
on the name) worked on an article that was eventually published in Mother   
Jones exposing the presence of PCBs in telephone transformers and   
outlining their toxic implications. Bob Holman once attended a session  
while visiting SF during which two of the writers had a serious     
disagreement over the details of Santeria and put hexes on one another.     
As a result of another incident, the workshop adopted a no guns in class    
rule. It was that kind of scene. Kit Robinson ran the same workshop after   
I left, as did John Mason. (And Erica Hunt was on the board of directors    
for awhile before she moved to NYC.)  It's still happening I believe,   
every Wednesday night at Hospitality House, 146 Leavenworth, SF.    
    
What impressed me most was how writing (poetry and fiction mostly, but  
not exclusively) was being used by the people in the workshop. It was   
very close to Paulo Friere (I probably just butchered that, sorry) and  
his use of photography as outlined in Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Writing    
provided a form and focus for thinking through their lives in a critical    
(in the best sense of that word) fashion. Furthermore, 250 represented  
over one percent of the entire community.    
    
It's important to remember that the Tenderloin is one of the poorest    
neighborhoods on the west coast (and has been transformed considerably  
since I worked there), so these folks in general didn't have a lot of   
toys and other distractions (very few were involved in family or even   
significantly bonded relationships). But any time you have one percent of   
a community writing, it's worth thinking through. The work ranged all   
over the map in style and general sophistication and I ran into a couple    
of real lumpen writers who were doing amazing things that, to this day,     
I've never seen anywhere else (I'm thinking of Harley Kohler and Spider     
James Taylor, whom Kit and Erica at least know) and whom to this day have   
barely ever been published.   
    
I wonder if I would have gotten one percent in a more rural (or even    
suburban) setting. Out where I work in Southeastern Alameda County,     
there's only one visible literary movement: romance novelists. There are    
between 20 and 24 publishing romance novelists out here, who will all be    
happy to tell you that 40 percent of all paperback books bought and sold    
are in their genre.  They range between Christian Fundamentalist    
"housewives" (that's a self-designation) to a biker couple out in   
Livermore. Since I don't read that genre, I can't tell you a lot more,  
but I get a sense that for them a magazine like Writers Digest is a     
living tool in a way that no poet has ever found it.     
    
But whenever/wherever I travel, I come across local writing communities     
that suggest that something much like this use of the written word is   
very widespread just beneath the surface. Certainly a look at the poetry    
items on the Usenet groups suggests that a dimension is going on there as   
well. One percent of the US population is over 2,000,000 people. So it  
wouldn't shock me at all to discover that one million really do write,  
maybe half of them writing poems. If Jimmy Carter's writing poems, who  
isn't? (And yes, Marjorie, I want you to read ALL of it.)    
    
This is where the "clubbiness" of so much of the "world" of the poetry as   
outlined in the NYT seems completely nuts.(Charles Alexander is     
completely right about that.)  And why even worrying about a failed     
institution like the Times seems ultimately a waste of breath. There is a   
hell of a lot of poetry out there. And, under the right conditions,     
there's an audience for almost all of it. Amen!

Subject:  Re: Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes, separate bodies    
    
I'm dropping into this conversation very late, but something caught my eye: 
    
    
The question of a distinct body of critical, theoretical, or prescriptive   
writings in a poet's work makes me proceed with caution...but as long as we 
are on the subject of Loy, Barnes, Stein, I wondered what Gary Sullivan     
(excuse me if I'm misdirecting this response) thought about Loy's   
"International Psycho-Democracy," "The Artist and the Public,"  "Phenomenon 
in American Art," or her many Aphorisms or "Feminist Manifesto," as well as 
the essay on Stein mentioned by Marisa Januzzi?  Although I am infinitely   
more interested in the theoretical implications of work such as "Brancusi's 
Golden Bird" or "Love Songs,"  the examples above are clearly       
self-consciously didactic statements.  I would agree with Marisa Januzzi that   
the social dimensions of Loy's work feed her aesthetic sensibilities.  "What    
counts as theory?" --certainly "Love Songs to Joannes" or "Anglo-Mongrels and   
the Rose"!  But...how could one say that Loy has no separate theoretical    
body???  In Roger Conover's edition of The Last Lunar Baedeker, he even     
portions out several works under such a title in the table of contents...

Dear David McAleavey,     
    
Your post on community and poetry interests me a great deal: the issue  
you foreground is similar, in fact, to a dissertation topic i'm working     
on: poetry/storytelling/moral law/community. It'll be a few more months     
before i actually start to approach the thing concretely; however, i do     
know that i want to focus on bpNichol's long poem THE MARTYROLOGY. i    
think it's an excellent text which raises new questions re the relation     
between theory & practice, theory/praxis, and interdisciplinarity   
, as well as questions of community, communal, sacred & visionary.      
    
i'm very interested in hearing more about your work-     
    
-and looking forward to meeting you in the machine, so to speak     
    
Take care,     
    
Carl Peters    
    
PS: hope this message gets to you without any distortions. i'm new to the   
system and its one i haven't really felt comfortable with nonetheless

Dividing the list won't improve what ends up in my to-be-read box on my     
receiving system at all, just increase the number of sources I get mail     
from. I also wouldn't be especially happy w/ a list moderator system    
(like the Sixties List has, for example). The Sixties List for example  
has kept off messages about the NEH battle, partly because it's not "on     
topic" but really I suspect more because a professional rightwinger like    
David Horowitz is on the list, ready to pounce on any "misuse" of an    
"edu" domain. I appreciate the contentious nature of some of the messages   
on the Poetics List and wish only that a broader community of poets were    
here and active.   
    
Someone mentioned a New Formalist listserv awhile back. Does anybody have   
subscription info to that? Inquiring minds want to know.

Subject:  NY School       
    
A compleat map/geneology (can't decide whether I prefer a spatial or    
temporal metaphor here) of the NY School would probably take about 10   
dissertations to get half accurate.   
    
I'm always amazed at how individual poets (including individual "NY     
School" poets) seem to draw the lines. I've never seen two the same. Not    
even remotely.     
    
I've heard arguments, like the one Darrell Gray used to make, that you  
couldn't "get" O'Hara until you saw how he extended the work of David   
Schubert, whose work came back into print awhile ago thanks to Ted Weiss.   
And at Naropa last summer I met students who had taken classes on the NY    
School who'd NEVER even read Koch. And had not heard him mentioned in the   
course (at least so they said, and they were not what Ginsberg refers to    
as the "chemical derangement of the senses" students either).       
    
One thing does seem clear: it is the only one of the so-called New      
American Poetries that has maintained a sense of unbroken    
intergenerational continuity over close to half a century. That's pretty    
amazing. But I'm not sure what it means.  
    
My theory is this: it means that the "first generation" didn't actively     
halt or stomp on the second one (FOH was dead, Ashbery still in Europe,     
Schuyler a recluse and Koch seems to have been actively supportive of   
younger poets) and once a more diverse scene was established, nobody was    
in control and something like a laisez farie democracy ensued. Permission   
and support is actually a pretty good model on how to behave toward     
younger poets. It doesn't hurt when the younger people are as forceful as   
Anne Waldman or Ted Berrigan either.  
    
At my 3,000+ mile distance, I got my sense of the scene most constantly     
through Tom Clark's Paris Review editing (which to this day still seems     
to me to be the most significant contribution he's made), not realizing     
that he was not in NYC and that some of his pals (Clark Coolidge for one)   
weren't either. More than any of the anthologies or more local mags, it's   
the image I still carry in my head.   
    
I know people who love Koch and people who can't stand him but who      
consider themselves "NYS" influenced. Personally, I think  _When the Sun    
Tries to Go On_ is one of the great longpoems of the 20th century, but  
I'm more ambivalent about the broader satirical pieces. I think we have a   
different sense of baseball.      
    
W/ my own lumpen background, I just don't "get" some of the influences on   
NY School poets (esp. in the first generation) from, for example, British   
and/or American academic poets (Auden, Bishop) etc and from musical     
theater. Ashbery, for one, never seems to have worried about his    
relationship to the Pound/WCW tradition and that distance from what I   
(especially as an anxious youngster, ready to "take sides") saw as the  
more rigorous post-Olsonian attempts at articulating a social theory of     
the line. They just didn't seem to worry about theory. (In fact, worry  
isn't a major theme in their work as I think it is for several of us, tho   
I'm not sure what to make of this either, tho I'm a little envious.)    
    
One thing I see today when I think of "NY School" is that there are a lot   
of women empowered within its tradition, such as Lee Ann Brown and Eileen   
Myles, and that it still seems to be evolving, interesting and sometimes    
quite powerful.

Dear Tony Green:   
    
If you want to define theory that broadly, then we have less 
argument--none in terms as you've extended my statement about       
"anticipation." I personally think this is where poetics and theory don't   
overlap. Where poetics is but theory isn't would be the most necessary  
area to me--and the least dangerous.

     BUFFALO (AHP) - Heir to the throne Prince Charles took     
his young son Gary and daughter Cass hunting yesterday, defying     
popular disapproval to initiate them into a traditional poetic      
pastime.   
  ``I think anyone who knows anything about the history of      
poetry can tell you, the skills necessary for tracking and killing      
an animal are similar to those required for ruling the Imagination,''   
said Yunte Huang, a spokesman for the Prince.    
     ``It was ... like shooting fish in a barrel,'' gushed the      
excited princess.  ``I wanna go out again.''     
     The royal trio were lashed by rain for several hours as they   
rode with the down-jacketed Poetics Hunt across rolling hills near      
Charles' country estate, The Fountainview Apartments, in Amherst.

  Gary, 10, and Cass, 12, have ridden at earlier meets but      
devotees of the sport said this was their first full-fledged 
critic hunt.   
  Charles, often accused of being out of touch with  
contemporary developments in poetry, has insisted his heirs should      
learn to hunt despite the anger of opponents who say the sport is   
bloodthirsty and cruel.

dear ron---thank you for taking up on marissa's NYS post. There's many  
questions I'm interested. The assumptiomn that NYS poets don't worry???     
There is the sense of the "laissez faire" Ashbery, the failure to write     
"critical (non-poetic) prose", the question of the relation to the Pound-   
Williams tradition (which is a whole other question---though I hear much    
talk of it, and Marjorie Perloff's perception that hardly anyone is both    
deeply engaged with both POUND AND STEVENS is interesting---One thing here  
is that instead of Pound and Williams as the "forward looking" and Stevens  
and Eliot as the "backward looking" of those "big 4" male modernists, there 
is an equally valid contention that Stevens and Williams are the more   
"forward looking" and Pound and Eliot "backward"--to say nothing of Loy,    
Moore, Stein, Riding...but I DIGRESS)...  
Anyway, reading Auden lately it's clearer and clearer to me his debt to     
Riding (stylistically if not sensibility wise)...and Riding (who Ashbery    
claimed among the three biggest Am.   
nfluences) is as rigorously THEORETICAL   
(though that's not quite the MOT JUSTE) as Pound. In fact, contrasting  
THREE POEMS with THE TELLING (published less than a year apart) could be    
a very illuminating academic paper (hint, hint). I'm only "scratching the   
surface" but i'll shut up now. But, there IS a nother question that has     
been on my mind, RON, since you posted your NEW YEAR'S NOTE invoking Leanne.    
I'm curious why you consider her a NEW YORK SCHOOL poet? It can't be quite  
the "historical" reason Tom gave for calling himself a LANG PO? Is it because   
she was IN NYC? Is Waldman a NYS poet? She's not (historically) a beat? But 
what does one call those who address the same issues the beats did but are  
not males with gottees and bongoes (as Jerome Sala would point out)? Not    
that this name game really matters (i feel silly quibbling about it) but    
I am curious about how "affiliations" are constructed from the outside in.

Since Mina Loy seems to be so popular on this list, is it possible that

Subject:  Re: Stein, Loy, H.D, et al  
    
I'm afraid that at the time I entered my message I had not read Gary    
Sullivan's posting fully because its subject title was regarding Sun and Moon.  
 As I'm a subscriber to four fairly busy lists, I tend to skim through a lot    
of messages then sit down and go through the ones that might be of      
interest when I have more time.  I realize now that I should have read  
your posting more fully as you were converging the issues in a way that I   
hoped somebody would.  This is probably a bit out of date now but I     
thought I should apologize.   
    
As far as earlier experimental writers (not necessarily women) who bring    
up feminist issues in their writing, Gary covered many of the women     
that are already fairly institutionalized on academic courses (and H.D.     
was also mentioned-thanks).   
    
Perhaps it are those who are not so well known that also need to be mentioned   
if not just for revising the poetic map.  Although Lorine Niedecker never   
wrote any essays as far as I know on theory in the same way that Stein or   
Loy did, her letters are full of her debating the feminist implications     
that certain directions in poetry may hold (Daphne Marlatt's vs Jean    
Daive minimalism for instance). Perhaps it is because she was on the edge of    
what has since been seen as a "movement" that she has been recently recovered,  
whereas there are many other writers who still remain forgotten-women who   
did not have the support network that people like Stein and Niedecker   
did.  How many indigenous North American women writers have been    
mentioned on this list, let alone from other non-European and       
non-American countries?  In the 1920s in Australia, Lesbia Harford was  
exploring the relationship between class and gender through her poetry in   
ways that overlap with Niedecker and others.  Yet, she remains largely  
unknown not only here but elsewhere.  She's just one that I  
thought I'd mention.   
    
I also apologize for my icecream 'melt'-we have the NZ icecream co over     
here & I might have discovered hokey pokey icecream through it.  What   
came first-tutti frutti or hokey pokey might be more a question of which    
came first-the chicken or the banana peel.  I would also like to put a  
vote towards keeping the list together-at least for now.  I don't know  
quite how you could toughen up on moderating the list-how have other    
lists handled the problem?  Does anyone know?

Subject:  Re: community: questions from what floor   
    
Feel strongly that it would be wrong to split or police this discussion.    
Apologies if any interventions from this quarter have been read as      
ill-judged (probably were) or contributed to what sense there is of waste.  
    
Genuinely fascinated by the nature of this medium, cf. Cris Cheek's     
succinct summary of its virtues and possibilities, (already quoted). The    
cocktail, book-launch, preview party is an apt metaphor, as much for the    
implied power/gender structures as for the indication of a likely tone.     
    
And the gallery is in the background, behind the chit-chat and idle banter  
with some fine works to be viewed over a quiet drink once you are cut loose 
from some particular conversation (although here the situation and the talk 
are the works). The latter image pertinent because one of the valued and    
to-be-defended aspects of visiting, say, a gallery is the ability to move   
past art works at high velocity dismissing whatever at the time seems   
irrelevant, distasteful or plain bad -- in the not-so-secret knowledge that 
what you are dismissing may be (is) important, interesting even great work. 
No one is forced to attend to anything in a gallery space and DOS forbid    
that they ever should be.     
    
Just so, our mailboxes are clogged but we have the power to empty them as   
necessary or desirable. Decisions like that should be left as close to the  
grassroots as possible, as a matter of principle.    
    
Finally, in this discussion surely the ludic, the occasional piece/fragment 
of poetics, parody, whatever is not only to be expected but encouraged,     
allowed to become a integrated part of the more usual discursive    
contributions? No, personal letters (unless they are open) shouldn't be     
posted (it can be embarrassing) but if you didn't overhear something like   
their contents from time to time it would spoil atmosphere of the party.    
    
    
You want to be someone else or to become part of the process.

Dear Michael:  
    
Touche'. Personally speaking, I didn't bring her up because: (a) I haven't  
read enough of her work to feel comfortable doing that; (b) others      
(notably Barbara Guest) have written extensively about her; and (c)     
because I haven't yet started to read her work, I didn't know if she was    
appropriate to bring up in the context in which I brought up Loy, Stein &   
Barnes.    
    
While I've got you here, Michael: loved your "Well, sometimes you get   
there and sometimes/ the there gets you, a simple fact of how/ turns it,    
a space of shifting constellations// at war with the mill"--from your   
series of poems in the new _First Intensity_. Very nice, that; liked the    
whole series, actually.

My disk has been full and has prevented me from responding for some time.   
Anyway, I have to note that Larry Grossberg speaking of doing       
pure theory must provoke peels of laughter.  My goodness.    
There is also something laughable about this talk of boy vs girl//      
theory vs practice.  I suppose there might be no escaping certain   
essential desires to repeat the same old shit, but really!!! 
It was not any particular woman who exposed Freud's misogyny, he wrote it   
there for all to see.  Furthermore, Hegel's bold statement that neither     
women nor Blacks could DO philosophy was hardly unprecedented.  What can    
one say to such statements?  It seems to me that they speak their own   
hysteria.  I became aware recently of how sad this state of affairs remains 
when, in a theory group I was leading, I said, "well, one is tired of   
white boys business as usual."  One of my male colleagues, feeling      
interpellated, it seems, said that he didn't like being referred to as  
a boy.  Shit, the things that remain unquestioned!!!!  I would hope, in     
any case, that ideas about policing the list that appear in such words as   
those I read in a post my Michael Boughn (pronounced Bone, I would say)     
that one should "get some police" in order to keep the list "hard,      
precise, penetrating" would be read as both high parody and hysteria.   
Moments like that, even just the sound of, "police," "precise," "penetrating"   
over the supposedly eviscerated electronic net, would be argument enough to 
open the list--even if, as one bro. suggested, one decides to read      
only the postings from the "names" one knows to be guantors of interesting  
stuff.A cop with a big cock, who could resist?  Who among us would cast. . .    
    
In any case, theory aside, I have noticed that certain sorts of behaviors are   
expected by women, others suspect.  I wonder, though, how the name or   
category WOMEN seems again so clear.  This list, if I may say so, seems     
to have fallen for several rather worn labels and strategies.  I was    
especially struck, after so many interesting (??) postings about poetry     
and the "public" to see a suggestion that certain things should be      
kept off or in another list; that some things should not be put     
before "the public."  Is this list now the long lamented absent public.     
Funny, too, that public should also devolve to PUBIK, as Ted Joans might    
pun.       
    
Oh, sorry.  Puns, let alone irony, insinuation, and insolence aren't,   
any more than invidious profanity (?), particularly woman-ish.      
How about getting away from the program, boys and girls?

Having just subscribed 2 weeks ago I am new to this kind of list email thing.   
Wanted to put my woman's voice into the mix. We are all survivors of    
patriarchy, that fact is genderless. How you choose to respond to that fact 
is up to your response - ability. The kind of continuous one-upsmanship, king   
of the heap games that are seem apparent on this list are characteristic of a   
patriarchal system in my opinion.     
    
 About what Alan Golding wrote:   
"On the recent theory exchanges: interesting that the theory discussion and 
the boy/girl talk have been going on simultaneously but in parallel lines,  
without much crossover. What's the relation between theory (the tendency to 
theorize, the kind of theorizing that gets done) and gender?"       
    
I found the gender discussion to be the more interesting of the two threads.    
To me the theory discussion seems kind of weird - do I really read that some    
people are saying that to be a good poet you have to be a theorist as well? 
Sorry, but this makes no sense to me. Unless the idea is that by writing and    
thinking about what you write and how effectively your creativity is working    
you are doing theory. Theory that interests me the most is more experiential    
- based on this is what has happened to me or what I have observed in the   
stream of life and this is what I think about that, less academic in nature 
than what is being posted, I'd say. I'm willing to read the more technical  
and academic stuff, but probably less likely to participate in those    
discussions. Don't know if this is gender based, but it might be, does seem 
to fit in a little with what other women are saying about responding more to    
the personal.

P.S. - Don't divide the list - sounds like a control issue to me!

  CYBERSPACE (AHP) - New York State's main state-run poetics    
 channel said yesterday it would stop posting responses to messages     
 because they were causing too much social disruption.   
  BoweryBoysVision (BBV) made the surprise announcement just a  
 week after President James Sherry imposed a ban on discussion of ``ice     
 cream'' and ``personal well being,'' a move industry executives    
 said would hit the major poetics channels.      
  An announcer on the main evening news read out a statement    
 from BBV directors saying the outpouring of chat had recently      
 ``been the source of great irritation and disappointment.'' 
  ``Therefore we have taken the decision to stop broadcasting   
 personal messages until strict rules are set up to regulate discussion     
 in interests of the economic development of society and ethnical norms.''

  The statement did not say when the ban would come into    
 effect or how BBV would make up the huge loss of programming       
 such a step would entail.    
  BBV and its main rival, the Co-poetry News Network (CNN),     
 came under heavy fire last year for showing continuous advertisements  
 by the ``Freely Espousing'' investment fund, which lured millions      
 of poets into parting with their work just before share prices were    
 slashed.      
  Although the government declined to ban ``Freely Espousing,''     
 this and other poetics projects were relegated to subsidiary channels.     
  ``Our task is to create mutual understanding and agreement    
 in society,'' the BBV statement said at the time.   
     ``In the best of all possible worlds,'' said Sherry, ``the     
 one man one vote principle would be extended to poetivision -- one     
 poet one channel.''   
  The new ban, which comes into effect from the moment it is    
 published in tomorrow's official government digest, said poets defying     
 the ban would be sued and their words appropriated for use in Lang-Po  
 Labs infomercials.

Everyone:      
    
Many responses backchannel re: Thorpe, asking where to find his books. I    
believe (last time I checked) Small Press Distribution has the four I   
mentioned. Most of you have that address, but maybe not everyone (it's a    
great one to have, if you don't):     
    
Small Press Distribution

Berkeley, CA  94702   USA     
(510) 549-3336     
    
Write or call them for a catalog--I *think* the catalog's free. Anyone in   
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area can borrow my copies of Thorpe's books;   
just ask.      
    
I was told by someone not on this list that Thorpe does have a book of  
"theory" out (I stand corrected). It's not in SPD's catalog; it was a   
mimeo or Xeroxed & stapled book that (maybe) Duncan McNaughton published.   
Whether or not copies are still available's uncertain. Stephen Ratcliffe,   
do you know?

Dear Kathryne:     
    
I thought, when I read Michael's post, it was tongue-in-cheek, and that     
he was *against* the idea of "policing." Maybe I need to switch to a    
breakfast cereal without the added irony?    
    
Anyway, I agree with you that the list shouldn't be regulated, policed,     
and certainly not divided up. The whole point seems to be to bring poets    
& critics & afficionados together, & see what happens. We're not here to    
perform Shakespeare. (Unless we want to do that, too, I guess.)     
    
As to the whole "boy/girl" discussion, I don't think anyone  
here is saying that men & women have different capacities for and/or    
interests in theory. I've liked reading what people have to say about   
this, actually; it seems to be one of the more generative topics    
currently under discussion. I know Colleen Lookingbill, and her post in re  
this subject was one of the few times I've read what she has to say about   
"how" she writes, what drives it. It was nice to get that. I'd like her     
poetry regardless of whether or not she ever wanted to talk privately or    
publicly about it, but this was a nice bonus, reading her confirm what  
I'd suspected--that hers is a poetry of personal experience (despite how    
it might otherwise appear at first glance).      
    
But, we sometimes have to ask questions to get at this stuff, to get    
people talking about X, Y, or Z, and sometimes, granted, the questions  
might seem simplistic, or backwards, or whathaveyou. A week or so before    
I got on this list, someone told me that someone (& my memory's not the     
best, so forgive me if I don't get this completely right) had said that     
they were afraid that people might think them "dumb" if they asked      
questions or responded, and someone else had responded: "What's wrong   
with that?" I totally agree. Someone once said that there are no correct    
answers, only correct questions. (Or something to that effect.) Well, how   
do you know which questions are the "right" ones until you've started   
asking?    
    
Anyway. I did appreciate your post. Thanks.

Dear Ira:      
    
Thank you much for such a well-considered response. I'd backchannel this    
to you, but you probably weren't the only one who felt I was attacking  
Marjorie, so I'd like to address that. I was, certainly, put off by what    
I felt to be Marjorie's pooh-poohing of the great unwashed on this list,    
the people she doesn't know. My post was not meant as an attack. I was  
questioning her, questioning specifically her raising the issue of      
cleansing the list of undesireables. (The fact that I've read _Radical  
Artifice_ [and other of her books] seems to suggest I've granted her a  
certain amount of respect, moreso than she seems to want to grant to    
her non-chums on this list.) I'd meant to suggest that, if she was more     
open to listening to & being available to others outside of her circle of   
friends (which we all have, of course), it would make her    
criticism--which I think is fine--even more valuable. Someone suggested     
to me, "backchannel," that Marjorie is a "friendly" critic, not an      
"enemy" critic. I don't think of critics (or reporters, like Dinitia    
Smith) as either. I do think she has a certain amount of responsibility,    
especially as such a visible critic (one of few mentioned in that _Times_   
article). And the questions I posted to her were originally questions that  
came up as I was reading _Radical Artifice_ a year or so ago. I liked the   
book, was definitely "on her side" reading it, but if *I* could have    
these questions about the appropriateness of certain work in that   
context, maybe I'm not the only one out here who does.   
    Cape's (or Cope's?) "article" on foxhunting was too kind to me;     
I'm not 10, I'm more like 5 or 6--meaning I've only been reading &      
writing & thinking about poetry for 5 or 6 years--and if someone as new     
to this as I am sees or considers significant (Bern Porter) "missings" in   
a book on Media & Poetry ... well, it made me really begin to question  
the book, what it really was (beyond its stated intentions). I had always   
wanted to write to Marjorie about that book, and once I got onto this   
list, I saw an opportunity. Unfortunately, it arrived with what I felt  
was a very disappointing post of hers. If it hadn't been for that post,     
I'd still have asked, though perhaps not as indignantly. Despite all the    
things you say about her work, what it gives you (& I agree), I still   
have those questions. Assuming this "a" and "b" list (which I don't     
understand, being new) refers to groups of people ("a=stars" 
"b=unwashed") ... well, if it's ever implemented as such, I'm sure I'll     
never get any answers. Mostly my loss.    
    Anyway, thanks very much for the response. It's much appreciated.

Subject:  NYT article     
    
   By way of brief introduction since this is my first post  
(I am a "boy" of fifty+ in truth and not posting under a 
male pseudonym):  I am a psychologist in private     
practice in Nashville who has recently revived an interest   
in poetry and poetics with some minor success.   
   I think I a much more coherent and relevant article than  
Dinita, and one that raises some issues that are worthy of   
discussion.  I do have to apologize for my anti-academic 
bias: this stems from earlier experiences of mine when I 
was an academic, and I have since moderated these views to   
some extent.   
   This article appeared in the November/December 1994   
issue of _Educom Review_ the hard-copy journal of EDUCOM 
and is also on their gopher.      
    
  LIVING LANGUAGE  
    
    Today a child was shot in my daughter's school.  Last       
week a local dealer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting.  
This is life today.  In the _American Poetry Review_, Eavan  
Boland tells of distress at her inability to include     
"awkward and jagged pieces of reality" in the decorums of poetry    
she admires.  Can can we afford a literature that doesn't deal      
with jagged andawkward reality?   
    
    Dana Gioia calls for poetry to become an important part     
of American culture when he asks, "Can Poetry Matter?"  Poetry      
is read aloud today in coffeehouses and bars, even if it has not    
yet gotten all the way to the street.  These are signals of the     
emerging reintegration of poetry and life.       
    
    
    In an even more significant development, vital and   
authentic poetry is appearing on the Internet and its byways.       
People who do not have a post-graduate degree in English are 
actually writing and reading poetry in discussion groups on  
bulletin boards, commercial services, and elsewhere on   
the "information superhighway," working to incorporate today's      
realities into today's e-literature.  They do this in a way  
that traditional writing has never been able to do, at least 
in a way that reaches significant numbers of American readers       
and listeners.     
    
    The Internet is more than just another venue for writers.   
It has opened up the field for a new audience and new material      
whose vitality and authenticity give hope to those yearning to lead     
literature out of the academy and onto the computer screens of      
America, if not actually out onto the streets.   
    
    The essence of capturing a slice of life in poetry or prose     
lies in the struggle to express it well or authentically.  These    
writers on the Internet are (with help from more experienced 
fellow writers) struggling to express life as they experience it.   
In more traditional and academic writing this vision is often       
missing.  I think these "awful" or "bad" (see "Bards on the  
Internet", _Time_, July 4, 1994) writers are the wave of the 
future.    
    
    This e-poetry is seen by some as "awful" and, indeed,       
it does have its awful moments (and hours and days).  But it 
is wrestling with a reality that doesn't require a post-graduate    
degree in writing to appreciate.  Even though it has not yet 
found its appropriate form, that will come with time, as it  
did for the Russian revolutionary Futurists and others. The  
search for a new content and form in literature and other    
arts often accompanies social revolutions, and particularly  
those associated with technological change.      
    
    Since this poetry is seeking to express the essence of      
what the writers are experiencing, the appropriate form will 
likely reflect the vital (and even frenetic) rhythms of life 
today along with a fascination with e-life.  Rap and beat and       
hip-hop song and poetry and poetry bands in bars are precursors     
of what will come, but the final flowering will happen on the       
Internet. It is here that the electronic engineer who didn't 
want to, or wasn't allowed to, take advanced poetry writing  
courses has a chance to wrestle with her despair over American      
culture following the shooting of her little sister's friend 
on a suburban playground.

To all those worried about cluttered mailboxes: have you tried the      
"digest" option?  The discussion does feel a little less "live" &   
somewhat more "archived," but it certainly helps to receive only one    
"message" per day rather than 30.  It also makes it possible for me     
to print the whole thing out as one file if I get tired of perusing     
pixels.    
    
On the other hand, it's a lot easier for a day or days to slip by w/out     
me getting around to poetics stuff at all.  I guess my personal jury is     
still out, but i'd recommend that people give it a shot to see if it    
alleviates their particular difficulties with navigating the infopoglut.

Subject:  the meaning of lang po  
    
>is it true that lang po means "inscrutable solace" in mandarin?    
    
A number of posible replies:      
    
1) Is it true that "lang po" means "tongue skin" in French?  
    
2) Whose transciption system are we using? Hopeful assumption is that the   
LangPo-friendly will have gone over to the sinocentric system (pinyin)  
where 'P' approximates more to the 'P' of 'Po', but perhaps old liberal     
traditions die hard and Free-China-familiars are looking up a 'Po' that's   
more like 'Bo'. (... and what about the vowels?)     
    
3) The only (commonish) surname with Lang as transcription is Lang2 (Xinhua 
Zidian 248.4). Perhaps a good choice in view of the boytalk thread because  
it was used as a pronoun-like word for young males and a word translatable  
as 'darling' which females addressed to males. The 'Po' surely has to be    
Po3 (Xinhua Zidian 337.2) 'impossible' (now only in literary registers).    
It's good graph too.   
    
4) No. But you can be sure there is a dictionary out there somewhere that   
will answer yes.   
    
5) Run this:   
    
on theMeaning_ofLangPo    
  put "darling,wolf,corridor,veranda,hammer,chain,mantis,light,bright,  
    loud,clear,wave,billow,breaker,unrestrained,dissolute" into Lang    
  put "lake,slope,sprinkle,spill,rude,unreasonable,shrewish,oblique,    
    biased,partial,quite,rather,considerably,matchmaker,midwife,white,  
    impossible,hackberry,compel,force,press,urgent,pressing,approach,   
    broken,damaged,torn,break,split,destroy,defeat,capture,expose,      
    reveal,paltry,lousy,soul,vigour,spirit" into Po  
  put word (the random of the number of items in Lang) of Lang into Lang    
  put word (the random of the number of items in Po) of Po into Po      
  answer "the meaning of LangPo is " & Lang & space & Po 
end theMeaning_ofLangPo       
    
(only slightly selective from _A Chinese-English Dictionary_, 1978)     
    
Answer number 3 above would be "darling impossible" for example.

I do apologize to Gary S for sounding what he took to be dismissive of  
those "I don't know."  I really didn't mean to sound that way.  I was   
writing (so far as reading all the messages go) out of sincere perplexity   
as to time frames.  Maybe it's just me but it seems that I'm totally    
overloaded with endless daily tasks that include writing on an average of   
a letter or two of recommendation a day, being graduate adviser and     
figuring out whether X can get rid of his or her language requirement by    
taking whatever "unusual" language or whether I can get around the Old  
English requirement by allowing someone to do Dante and so on.  So I guess  
my complaint has less to do with the poetics discussion group than with a   
general perplexity as to how to get through the day in the current academy. 
Therefore, when I turned on the Mac at night and found all those endless    
messages, it seemed overwhelming.  But now that I have it as a "digest" it's    
really much better.  And it did bring in that piece from Ira, which is  
certainly one of the nicest reviews I've ever had.  So who can complain?    
    
Enough on that front for a while, I hope....

I appreciate this forum, and I think it's great that more people are    
contributing, both women and men.     
    
The following is an attempt to respond to all those who wrote me over the   
past week, plus others who didn't. It is also an attempt to clarify or do   
a better job of indicating certain feelings and concerns that I have    
about the literary world today.   
    
1) My argument is not with theory per se. My argument involves claims that  
are made for theory, uses to which it is put and effects it often has.  
    
2) I am for the freedom of the individual to think things through for   
hirself. To do that, s/he must fend off or overcome pressures to conform to 
correct ideas, which today are formidable.       
    
3) I believe the discourse and social reality surrounding poetry has    
become more important than the poetry itself. When I said poetry was on     
its own level, that was nothing more than an attempt to counter this sense  
of skewed priority that I feel pervades the scene.   
    
4) I am concerned about the degree to which all communication surrounding   
the poetry is framed as "literary politics." I am concerned about the   
dominance of this frame, the way it all becomes a game we play at to the    
detriment of our art and its greatest goals.     
    
5) What's matters to people in this literary world is not community. What   
matters is spheres of influence. Each person's spheres are a little     
different and some have more or broader spheres than others. But these  
spheres are not communities because they are motivated and defined      
entirely by the dynamics of personal and literary influence. 
    
6) Much energy is directed toward appreciating and understanding those  
within one's approximated spheres of influence. (The stronger the sphere    
or link, the more the energy.) Far too often, alienation is the keynote     
with respect to everyone else. Alienation and a tendency to project the     
blame and responsibility for problems onto an elsewhere as variously    
perceived or defined.     
    
7) Denial is an important part of the game. There are many different ways   
of denial, too many to list here. It may be that denial, more than      
anything else, is what keeps people playing, what allows them to stay   
focused and do what is necessary to be a good competitor.    
    
8) What about the person who can't or won't play this game? My feeling is,  
s/he doesn't have much chance. My feeling is, you're forced to play if you  
want to survive as a creatively engaged poet in this world today.

I just did a search in the archives of the recently-established CAP-L   
list (Contemporary American Poetry). In their discussions so far the    
word "iamb" does not appear and there seems little talk of formalism    
of any sort--new, old, or middle-aged. Isn't there a real good      
McCarthyite pigheaded sonnet-writing bunch of people somewhere? Or      
have they gone the way of the snail-darter?      
  The list called "Prosody" has mostly been taken over by linguists,    
phonologists, phoneticists, etc and is very strong on things like   
glottal clicks.

Dear H.T. Kirby-Smith:    
    
Although it's not specifically dedicated to poetry, the  
Philosophy-Literature list seems to contain many of the people you're   
looking for. I checked out a while ago, after the list boss proposed    
Timothy Steele as the height of American achievement in poetry.     
    
Good hunting.

In response to Ron's, Spencer's, and Colleen's posts:    
    
Ron, I DID frequent the Hospitality House, but as a painter, not a writer.  
The place is proof that there are lots of poets/artists out there that are  
interested in more than politics, and in being a part of a community that may   
not have much to give back in return in terms of professional advancement (or   
whatever the hell you call it).  Without the Hospitality House, my stay in  
San Fran would have been worse, to say the least.  And, man, I know a lot of    
the people that worked there worked for just a few pennies, for a living!   
    
Spencer, I agree with you that theory is used as a power tool too often, and    
that at the same time it can be useful, and that the poem is what counts (if    
anything counts at all), whatever is brought to it.  But isn't this politics    
bullshit something we're going to find ANYWHERE there is more than one  
person?  I hate it as much as you do, but I've never managed to get away from   
it.  Wether its working with a road crew, living in a half-way house, buying    
hash in Morocco, or programming for a corporation.  The trick seems to me to    
be that if it happens, to see that it doesn't happen destructively.  Or, if 
it does happen in a "bad" way, to BURN it.       
    
I just want to re-iterate one of Colleen's comments:     
    
We are all survivors of patriarchy, that fact is genderless. How you choose 
to respond to that fact is up to your response - ability. The kind of   
continuous one-upsmanship, king of the heap games that seem apparent on this    
list are characteristic of a patriarchal system in my opinion.      
    
I agree whole-heartedly.  One up-manship?, shit, I thought that didn't exist    
in the poetry world (call me naive).  As much as I want to read lots of     
theory (as general and almost meaningless as that term is), in response to  
anyone that wants to force it down my throat, well, I have lots and lots of 
crude responses to make.  Plus a few things to throw.  Is that      
unprofessional?

Subject:  Thoughts About Engagement   
    
Spencer's most recent post quite clearly crystallizes some of the concerns  
that have been discussed around theory/participation/community and the like.    
 His post brings to mind for me the extent to which it perhaps always has   
been true that there's little room, certainly in art, and probably in most  
things, for the pure entity of THE PROCESS AND WHAT'S MADE to exist without 
that entity's being propped up by loads of self promotion.  An unspoken kind    
of currency exists in many realms of endeavor.  Specifically, having    
"something to trade," some commodity to hold/exchange/seek that puts one on 
the board at all.  This offering can take the form of publishing, producing 
programs, critical perspective published or spoken, and undoubtedly several 
more.  Spoken opinion or assessment concerning someone's work, where and how    
it fits, what new ground it breaks, etc., has particularly high value   
associated with it.  To me, it has always been true that this kind of   
exchange pattern has been present.  But with the abundance of material and of   
distribution channels (be they small/large, unofficial/official), including 
the machines we can access to share them, there's been an escalation of need    
to create focus on any given work. (Sort out something that seems to deserve    
light)  However people fare within this system, combined with their own needs   
for recognition, (and these are not the sole variables!)  seems to connect to   
levels of frustration or levels of felt reward.  I suspect that the struggle    
to be counted forces many people to have to expend far more effort than they    
would choose just getting into the middle of things and being perceived as  
complete..  This, of course, can rob time from producing work one cares about   
producing..  I feel this among people in the earnings world, too.  So much  
energy goes into getting one's name out about one's business services, etc.,    
that there's too little time (sometimes) left for doing what one does. This 
whole issue seems pertinent to the theory question within the world of  
practice.  I hate to put theory into the category of "must do," as though it    
were something no one would do if they didn't have to, because it's at least    
potentially worthy and elegant and illuminating an a thing unto itself.     
(Transcending the level of inventing a frame within which to illuminate what    
one is doing!)    But for some people, at least the writing about writing   
aspect is a price to pay to get closer to what is wanted.    
    
I have no particular answer for this except to say that the sooner one can  
pursue something at the center of her or his passionate concerns, without the   
requirement of having to "pay dues," the more satisfying and possibly   
meaningful the work can become.  I suppose that dues paying will always be  
with us (But try not to think of it as often as I think about my work!)

Hi James, thanks for posting that rationale again. I must have missed it    
the first time, since I'm suddenly getting so much e-mail and ironically,   
find it hard to get the time to read it all. Also I tend to read shorter    
messages first with the express intention of going back to look more    
thoroughly over what look like longer, maybe more complex posts. Sometimes, 
I forget which ones I mean to go back to. Sometimes I'm printing certain    
posts out because I want to respond to them but also want to unclog the     
space. I'm thinking about this issue of community as raised recently. The   
size of this 'community' must be getting up towards that 250 which Ron  
identified for Tenderloin. I'm a (now relative) newcomer  -  it seems   
positively active, with a rapid convergence and hexvergence across agendas. 
Obviously more and more people are subscribing at present (any figures  
Loss) - there you see I just jumped from what was intended as a so-called   
backchannel message to what can now be addressed in part to the whole  -    
is there an exponential volume at which point a list such as POETICS might  
take on either a debilitating or invigorating entropic quality ? Might not  
simply particularised 'loop', as you term them, agendas achieve a measure   
of what might help ? I don't appear to be alone in being excited by the way 
this list is developing ?     
What percentage of people's posts are sent to all subscribers ? My      
experience is of posting two-thirds 'privately' and one third 'publicly'    
but of getting public to private in a ratio of 2:1.  
    
This list seems yet to be poised to address the issues raised by how to go  
beyond being merely a community of interests to becoming a community of     
evolving friendships and alliances that both is and also furthers the   
development of the work.

Yes, cris, I think that the list at its best can be both interesting in     
and of itself in terms of the discussions we can have on it ANd     
generative of independent relationships on both one-to-one and sub-group    
levels. The effective limits of community are not yet clear, but from   
several people's perspective they relate to the number of messages one  
can get through considering the available time. This obviously differs  
for different people, so the quantifying of community is not possible at    
a single value for all participants. What I am looking for is a     
suggestion how to "customize" each person's community according to their    
capacity and interest. It's a hard question, but I think one worth      
working on. It has a lot of assumptions that need to be exposed before we   
can get too far. Clearly the group has about 3-1 rejected a simple      
division by message type. But as you point out the question does not go     
away. I'd still appreciate hearing further responses at this new level. James

From my point of view the question arose about 20 years ago in response     
to the New Criticism's perspective, which you and Spencer have affinity     
for although not congruence with, that only the poem in itself is a valid   
carrier of meaning. Several dozen people have been workingfor 20 years to   
expand the view. James

WORK OF NEA IN SAN DIEGO DEFENDED BY REP. BOB FILNER     
    
On 24 February 1995, Democrat Bob Filner made the following remarks in the  
context of defending federal funding for the arts:   
    
    "In San Diego County, the San Diego Opera Company and the San Diego 
Symphony provide opportunities for kids to attend the opera and symphony    
concerts.  The opera regularly goes out to schools with ensemble    
performances.  
    San Diego's recipients of arts funding range from elementary    
schools and universities to KPBS public radio and TV to the Samahan     
Philippine Dance Company and the Centro Cultural de la Raza to the Balboa   
Park Museums and the Old Globe Theater, groups representing the entire  
population of San Diego County.   
    TheatreForum, an international theater magazine published at UCSD;  
the renowned La Jolla Playhouse whose productions go on to thrill audiences 
on Broadway and in the rest of the country; an international festival at    
locations on both sides of the border between San Diego and Tijuana,    
Mexico; graduate internships at the Museum of Photographic Arts; touring    
exhibitions from the Museum of Contemporary Arts in San Diego.  I could go  
on and on.  These and hundreds of other art forms are advanced by arts  
funding in San Diego County."     
(from the Congressional Record, p. H2218)    
    
    
PROPOSED RESCISSIONS   
    
The House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee (Ralph Regular, R-OH, chair) 
approved a recision package that included a significant cut to FY 95    
funding for the NEA and NEH.      
    
The figures we've seen indicate that if the proposed recisions are      
approved, the NEA cut will be $1m (administrative) and $4m (program), with  
the bulk of program-budget reductions targeted toward individual artist     
grants.    
    
On 16 February, some members of this Subcommittee (only 7 of the 14     
actually) had heard testimony from Rep. Amo Houghton (R-NY), a supporter of 
the NEA/NEH; Richard J. Franke, chairman of the John Nuveen Company and a   
past chairman of the Illinois State Humanities Council; David McCullough;   
Ken Burns; and Clay S. Jenkinson, "noted for his scholarly impersonations   
of Thomas Jefferson at NEH sponsored Chautauquas" [!].   
    
SENATE EDUCATION, ARTS AND HUMANITIES SUBCOM     
    
[note: what follows is redacted from a National Campaign for Freedom    
Expression summary of 23 February activity]      
    
Among those who testified were:   
    
*Christover Reeves, actor and President of the Creative Coalition, who  
reportedly called for creating a "real endowment"  by setting aside a   
portion of the NEA's budget over the next 7 years with the intention of     
creating an endowment base that could be supplemented by private 2-to-1     
matching funds.  Reeves argued that this timed phase-out of taxpayer    
support would decrease the hostile "politicization" of cultural subsidies.  
Harold Williams (president of the J. Paul Getty Trust) and others   
testified that reaching the  $3-3.5 billion base necessary to generate  
$167m annually was an unrealistic 7-year goal.   
    
*Leonard Garment (lawyer, former advisor to Nixon, co-chair of the 1990     
Independent Commission mandated by Congress to review the NEA) proposed     
consolidation of the Endowments: one chair, a deputy for arts and one for   
humanities, and a council appointed by various elected officials that would 
include the President and Speaker of the House.  The restructured Endowment 
would not grant individual artist grants,  Only institutions of "national   
stature" would be directly supported, with block grants going to smaller    
institutions.  
    
*George White (NEA National Council Member and founder/president of the     
Eugene O'Neill Theater Center) and Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT and   
subcom member) proposed to change copyright laws to supplement the      
Endowments' budgets.  The proposal would permit the government to auction   
literary and artistic works after their copyrights expire, with proceeds    
routed to the NEA. 
    
Note: We have heard White speak about this copyright idea but still don't   
quite understand what he has in mind.  This NCFE account doesn't clarify    
matters much.  An Associated Press report on the Subcomittee hearing    
summarized White's position as follows:  "He proposed extending copyrights  
on such things as plays and music, with revenue from the added royalties

And expand they should. But with the usual pendulum effect, things swish far    
in one direction.  I find theory and discussion enriching at least, yet feel    
concern about any climate that would seem to dictate that a writer who is   
real, concerned, or whatever must become a full service provider of the range   
of thought services.   
    
Sometimes, when in the midst of discussion, I begin to want to find a poem. 
 Perhaps simply a bout of longing that could be dismissed as discourageable 
emotion or hunger for a different thing.

Subject:  Bob Filner & NEA $$     
X-cc:     jrothenb@ucsd.edu   
    
Bob Filner, the lone Democrat from the San Diego region, made a speech  
on behalf of the NEA in Congress on Friday. Herewith, as reported in the    
Congressional Record, is what he said:    
    
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bateman). Under a previous order of the    
House, the gentleman from California [Mr. Filner] is recognized for 5   
minutes.   
    
Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, I rise today in support of      
continued Federal funding for the National Endowment  for the Arts , the    
National Endowment  for the Humanities, the Institute for Museum    
Services and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. To be or not to be    
civilized; that is the question, Mr. Speaker.    
    
A civilized society must include art  and cultural enrichment, and it is    
one of the responsibilities of government to support that aspect of our     
civilization. We get what we pay for. We cannot rely solely on the good     
will of a relatively few private individuals to fund the arts --it is   
the duty of us all.    
    
This Nation's investment in the arts  is one of the best we make. For   
example, the approximately $2 million in Federal funding for the NEA,   
NEH, and IMS that goes to my county in California, San Diego County, is     
matched by nearly four times that amount in local contributions. This is    
a perfect example of public-private partnership. The Government's   
funding stimulates local giving to the arts  which in turn stimulates   
local economies.   
    
According to a recent study commissioned by the California Arts     
Council, nonprofit art  organizations contribute some $2.1 billion      
annually to California's economy, generate $77 million in tax revenue,  
and create some 100,000 jobs. Yes, the arts  are important to the State     
economy of California, and to other States as well. Business Week says  
that Americans spent $340 billion on entertainment in 1993.  
    
Critics tell us that the arts  are only for the elite. Nothing could be     
further from the truth. Audiences and participants alike are people from    
all walks of life. Nearly 40 million tickets were sold last year to     
theater, music, and dance performances. Nielsen-rating figures show that    
56.5 percent of households watching PBS programs earn less than $40,000     
a year. And a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll showed that 76 percent of   
respondents thought the Government should continue to fund public   
broadcasting. Exposure to the arts  is especially important for our     
children. If our young people can be motivated, thrilled, enriched, and     
`turned on' by exciting experiences in theater, painting, pottery, or   
dance, they will be less likely to `turn on' to drugs or gangs to fill  
their empty hours and empty souls.    
    
Barbra Streisand, in a speech at Harvard University earlier this month,     
told how participation in the choral club at her Brooklyn high school   
was the beginning of her career--and she urges more support for the arts    
, not less. She asks how we can accept a country which has no       
orchestras, choruses, libraries, or art  classes to nourish our     
children. How many more talents like Barbra Streisand's are out there,  
whom we will lose when there are no programs to challenge them?     
    
In San Diego County, the San Diego Opera Company and the San Diego      
Symphony provide opportunities for kids to attend the opera and symphony    
concerts. The opera regularly goes out to schools with ensemble     
performances.  
    
San Diego's recipients of arts  funding range from elementary schools   
and universities to KPBS public radio and TV to the Samahan Philippine  
Dance Company and the Centro Cultural de la Raza to the Balboa Park     
Museums and the Old Globe Theater, groups representing the entire   
population of San Diego County. TheatreForum, and international theater     
magazine published at UCSD; the renowned La Jolla Playhouse whose   
productions go on to thrill audiences on Broadway and in the rest of the    
country; an international festival at locations on both sides of the    
border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico; graduate internships at   
the Museum of Photographic Arts ; touring exhibitions from the Museum of    
Contemporary Arts  in San Diego. I could go on and on. These and    
hundreds of other art  forms are advanced by arts  funding in San Diego     
County.    
    
Even so, among all First World nations, the United States now spends the    
least on Federal arts  support per citizen--and we are thinking of      
reneging on that support. If we say no to culture, we will prove, in the    
words of Los Angeles Philharmonic managing director Ernest Fleishmann,  
that `we are the dumbest Nation on the planet.'      
    
According to the General Accounting Office, the Department of Defense   
plans to spend $9 billion over the next 7 years building nuclear attack     
submarines that the Pentagon admits it does not need. That $9 billion   
could sustain the Arts  and Humanities endowments  at current levels for    
26 years. 26 years of National Public Radio, Big Bird, music and art    
for kids--or superfluous subs for the Pentagon. Is this a difficult     
choice?    
    
If we defund the NEA, the NEH, the IMS and PBS, we will be telling the  
world that we no longer take pride in our theaters, our educational     
children's programs, our museums, our dance companies, our poets,   
ourselves.     
    
Ultimately, we are judged by the heritage we leave our children. I hope     
we leave them more than soap operas and talk shows, attack submarines   
and assault rifles, gangs and drugs!  
    
Yes, Mr. Speaker, to be or not to be civilized; that is the question.   
    
---------------------------------     
    
Randy "Duke" Cunningham (as he's listed in all the House directories),  
the GOP member who will chair the authorization subcommittee that will  
consider the fate of the NEA, has the district next to Filner's. So     
Filner can be a key allie. He & Cunningham may be mortal enemies, but he    
ought to know how best to turn up the heat on him on this issue. Steve &    
Jennifer, Jerry & Michael & Rae, take note & take action!

Dear James,    
    
Please don't misread Sheila & Spencer's posts. Neither said *only* the  
poem is a valid carrier of meaning. Closer would be: The poem is the    
*primary* carrier of meaning. They're saying much more than that; you   
might take another look. Reducing their concerns, which are fairly      
complex, to anything equivalent to New Criticism is like dismissing the     
concerns of the language movement (especially those who write in length     
about the political value of the work) as those of WPA muralists. Your  
conclusion above has a nice epigrammatical ring to it, but little more.     
    
More on this later.    
    
Yours,     
    
Gary

Getting back to what was a topic at the begining of the po/theor    
discussion, which was about whether every poem had a theory within or   
behind it, whether poems embodied theory in some way . . .   
    
I think that we are using the term theory loosely, that poetics or      
philosophy may be what we sometimes mean, even though these are also used   
more loosely than Aristotle might like. Simply "a body of thinking" might   
suffice.   
    
I certainly believe that Sheila Murphy & Spencer Selby's work, both of  
which are supple in movement, fluid in their construction of patterns of    
sound, and moving in their humanity (there's a loaded term, too), also  
have, within and behind them, important bodies of thinking. If they value   
the poems more than such theory or philosophy, that's fine -- I would   
agree with them, while still in some ways wanting to unlock the thinking    
to more fully inform, for me, the poems and the world. But I don't think    
their greater interest in the poems devalues the theory in any way, so I'm not  
certain if we really have an argument here. Either that, or my response to the  
issue is relaxing as the time & messages pass by.    
    
Regarding Spencer's frustration at the concentration on power games and     
spheres of influence in the literary world, I would say that I recognize    
such things and sometimes also decry them. I've been in situations where    
I brought to a community I moved to an approach to poetry/poetics which     
was not present, and helped to build a community of interest. I guess we    
created a sphere of influence, and while I thought it was open to anyone,   
I know and heard there was some resentment from people who felt they    
weren't invited in. My thinking was that it was the nature of specific  
concerns which provided the grounding for that sphere or community, and     
anyone who wanted to think about those concerns, even if they had   
disagreements, was invited in. But that wasn't always the perception.   
I've also had the experience of bringing myself to a community, more    
recently, because of a new job, in which I find almost no outlet for my     
own concerns about poetry, and I don't feel welcomed by others. We all  
have stories like this, I am sure. Still, within this sometimes     
deplorable situation, be it local or international or something in      
between, I've also managed to find true friends, cooperation, a sense of    
commonality with many, so that I don't feel as negative about it all as     
it seems that Spencer does. I don't think the manipulation of spheres of    
influence is by any means the only story. There is some sustenance as well.

    Gary's (Sullivan's) defence of Spencer and Sheila's positions as    
    something that need not (should not) be reduced to a simplistic caricature  
    understanding of "New Criticism" is well-taken. How easy is it for  
    so many to mouth an "anti-New Criticism" stance without really knowing  
    what N.C. was---for if the L poets are not a monolith, neither is   
    New Criticism, and so much of the conversation once again becomes a     
    navigating of the alleged "minefield" of the connotations of various    
    movements---be it "New Criticism," the "Pound-Williams line" or the     
    "Apex G2ers"--and this all has the effect of "translating" consciousness    
    (or culture, if you must) into something very "pinball" like...     
    And yes we may well wonder whether the stars are conscious of the   
    constellations we "put them in" and whether that consciousness can be   
    seen as the REASON why they burn out (though of course we don't know    
    they're burnt out yet), and there's probably some reason, some driving  
    urge that should not be ignored, to PLACE OURSELVES, to orient ourselves,   
    through the use of stickfigures. But to claim there's a definite    
    anchor of certainty in such poetic schemas of culture is to not take    
    seriously enough the potential power of reification and idolatry that   
    can habituate identity to a point of barren solipsism. Otherwise,   
    you can surely guess. Chris S.

One of the easiest things posters can do to make things easier on their readers 
is to send out posts with very clear subject lines.  Most systems allow     
users to change or revise subject headers; it's worth learning how to do.   
Outside policing or moderating isn't necessary if folks simply take the time    
to label their contributions accurately.  For example, the following subject

    ANTI-HEGEMONY PROJECT: Poetics list takes toll...    
    
Discussion thread headers like    
    
    Boytalk    
    
    E - speration and Communit - E    
    
    Theory     
    
are also really useful *if* people stick to the thread while using thread   
headers.  It's a good idea to *change* the thread if you change the subject,    
for example:   
    
    "Tone" in Espace (was: Boytalk)   
    
Clearly identifying subject lines allow those with limited time to delete   
stuff they aren't interested in without taking the time to open the message 
and without fear of missing something they *are* interested in.     
    
My two cents,

 ---------------------------------------------   
      W = A = R = N = I = N = G   
    
 A toxic spill of Lang-Po Labs' Simulac infant   
 formula caused a linguistic disturbance in      
 Cyberspace this past Valentine's Day and some   
 Newsgroups appear to have been affected. As a   
 result of this disturbance mutation in the      
 language is expected. If you suspect that a     
 message sent to your account has been tainted   
 contact authorities at The Anti-Hegemony    
 Project immediately.     
    
     ***DO NOT READ TAINTED MESSAGES.***     
    
 Rest assured we are working on the problem.

I picked up the term on the VWAR-L, a list populated by many military   
veterans as well as a certain percentage of wannabe veterans, fake vets, and    
interested others.  It was the first place I ever heard it, though      
everywhere I've used it, it's been picked up immediately because people like    
it (I like it; that's why I use it).  My in-house military consultant   
(business partner Steve Gomes, a Desert Storm-era vet) says it's a      
faux-military term based on the notion of switching to an alternate     
frequency, off the "command channel" or public frequency.  What makes it    
useful, I think, is that it emphasizes that there are "lines" or "channels" 
of communication in espace, different "frequencies" which are accessible to 
different audiences.

 I just thought I'd put just my opinion of silliman  
 He totally excites me and I am always looking forward to what      
 he'll do next....no matter what he does I like.  Does   
 anyone know if the Bay Area book awards will be broadcast on Pacifica and when?
 I predict he will give readings in the early fall of 2000.  I saw the  
 Ear Inn show in New York City..It was increadible and unreal...    
 I paid 85 bucks for my share of the dinner after...but it was worth it!    
 WHAT came as a shock to me...I saw Toner in Sulfur and flipped out...I LOVE    
 paradise ...and lit...and ABC    
 and       
 hell  the whole damn alphabet....It really bugs me when people put him     
 down...they are just jealous and ignorant.....I'm looking forward      
 to what he does next!

I would be interested to know if the following in any way serves to     
describe Language Poetry, and, if not, what sort of poetry it might     
seem to describe-- 
    
Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed    
round for each one of us by that  
thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever      
pierced on its way to us, or from us  
to that which we can only conjecture to be without. Every one of    
those impressions is the      
impression of the individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a   
solitary prisoner its own dream   
of a world . . . To such a tremulous wisp constantly reforming itself   
on the stream, to a single    
sharp impression, with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting,    
of such moments gone by, what is  
real in our life fines itself down. It is with this movement, with      
the passage and dissolution of    
impressions, images, sensation, that analysis leaves off--that      
continual vanishing away, that strange,   
perpetual weaving and unweaving of ourselves.

    LOS ANGELES (AHP) -- In a story yesterday about a study examining   
how shortages of inspired language and increasing population will affect    
U.S. poetics production and Americans' diet of subsidized corn porn lyrics, 
The Anti-Hegemony project erroneously reported the corporate affiliation    
of a researcher.   
    Marjorie Perloff is employed by Lang-Po Labs, not Arithmetrick  
Frozen Yogurt Co. Down Under.

There's many a slip 'twixt the theory and the hip.

    I'm all in favor of keeping relevant discussions on the one list,   
but speaking as someone who lives in the middle of the Pacific (though it   
wouldn't matter where I lived), I'd love to see extended in-jokes put on    
another list entirely.  I promise not to subscribe.

Where did all this excitement about flaming Silliman come from? It's    
as if he were famous like Prince Charles instead of a poet doing his    
job and beginning to get known outside the tight citcle. Give him and   
us a break. He writes and he edits. He aint Prince Charles.
