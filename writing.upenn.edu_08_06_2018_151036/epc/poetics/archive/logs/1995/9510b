Bukowski and Ginsberg still very high on list of
second-hand bookshop's
buyers in Auckland ( I learned last Thursday)
 -- shd be plenty for them to buy
and re-sell  eventually since both
writers featured in University Bookshop stock
until recently (though
not specially featured in teaching I guess.)

Wystan,
 
To be honest, I'm not familiar with the film. Although this does seem
to make sense. I also heard (though I've not seen it) that there's a
Poetry in Motion 2 CD-ROM which makes me suspect even more that you
are correct. If you find out, it would be interesting to know.
 
With best,
Loss

Subject:      Top ten poems
 
Like Ric, I made a point of avoiding the National Poetry Day nonsense -
fortunately, here in Peckham, an inner-city district of London, there were few
manifestations of it. However, I make no apologies for posting the top ten to
this list, as food for thought. I have often wondered about the gulf between
perceptions of poetry at large and the view of it shared by many of us here. I
have my "poetry" friends and my other friends, and should the conversation ever
turn to poetry with my "other" friends, which is but rarely, embarrassment often
ensues. For example: the subject of the top ten poll came up yesterday evening
in the pub, so I mentioned my amazement that Kipling's Victorian moralistic
doggerel "If" had come up top. At which a friend - by no means unsophisticated
in other respects - further amazed me by saying slightly shame-facedly that he
used to have it tacked up on the wall at home. Then another friend went on at
length to me about listening to something by James Fenton on BBC Radio 4. If you
admit you're a poet in this country, you risk either an embarrassed silence or
someone blathering on about James Fenton, a poet whose work I particularly
detest, seeking my approval thereby. So, usually I don't. Admit I'm a poet, that
is.
 
This is an awful state of affairs, isn't it? If I were a painter, would I go
round afraid to admit it in case folks get embarrassed, or that I might
unwittingly provoke them to seek my opinion on bad Victorian narrative painting
or chocolate-box art, or tell me what a "comfort" painting is? Hmm, probably
not.
 
For non-UK readers, I should stress that the poll was taken from listeners to
BBC national radio, notoriously middle-class and middle-brow. Round this
neighbourhood, you'd be hard pressed to find people who've heard of many of the
poets/poems on the list (you might get the odd Irish drunk who could quote the
Yeats poems verbatim, though). In its favour, the top ten at least included some
good poems, though perversely I can't help feeling they're now slightly tainted
by association. What an elitist I must be!
 
Now, Ric, let's have some opening nominations for that worst ten poems list.

my thanks to all for your insights on the dashes -- since posting that

as indexical of mulit-voicedness -- maybe something similar to what

Dear Herb,
        A useful comparison. This current subject comes in various
guises in our discussions, and its a frequent not to say chronic one:
why isn't our art more popular? more powerful? It's a complaint we can
share with other arts, as you say. Although there are differences and I
was disappointed the question as to why the visual arts have grown more
confident which was recently raised did not get much substantial
discussion. Didn't modernism demolish the middle class audience for the
contemporary arts? Has anyone not an enemy of modernism done a decent
postmortem on this? Our problem so often seems to be that while we
persist in producing texts as opaque or offensive as modernist texts
(its a measure of their criticality) we take no pleasure, feel no glee,
no superiority, when they get the same reception. There seems no
likelihood poetry will make a comeback. Perhaps it is the art form above
all which should insist on its failure, come to terms with its
invisibility, should... perhaps because that's its only choice. What do
the rest of you reckon?

wystan,
        in response to your final point: i think poetry is most
powerful when it embraces, threads into itself, the
inevitability of its failure.

As I was saying to Wystan on the phone, I'm still
 not anthologized --- Wystan, you're getting to be
a shade more translucent yrself these days?
 
My belief is one does one's worst and get it out there in
the space of public utterance, even if in no more than
fifty copies or, reading/reciting aloud, no copies at all. (Then
if it gets to be used by someone else -- as taught in
a classroom, move on smartly.  I've seen imitation of
a reading piece I did in 1978, thanks to an extra-mural
 class in which it was used. It had been published in a
student yearbook of which the editor was my wife.
 But the imitation  missed much of the point which
was its inordinate length. Move on!)
                                             Are poets still the
speakers for the otherwise unspoken for? the
ultimate resistance to the imposition on the
defenceless and the oppressed by the law
 and therefore the language of  the powerful.
                       (Legislators, thus, and unacknowledged,
                          looking after "the government of the
                           words", acc. W.C.Williams
                             as cited by Robert Creeley).
That is the line taken by H.Cixous recently
(Critical Inquiry, about three years back)
to whom reference was made recently on this
list. The measure we have been tending to has
been rather publication, scale of publication,
success in publication, entry throught the academy.
 
Opacity from one point of view is translucency to
 another.  Is it the ambition of poetry through
publication and the academy to change the viewpoint
of readers, so that what starts out opaque, becomes
translucent?
 
Is this a fundamental issue in the debate over
the mysterious political value of poetry?

 Please pardon my misquote. Interesting point Charles raises. It reminded
me of the poem by Andrei Codrescu entitled: De Rerum Natura (from which I
feel the need to quote because paraphrasing would do Codrescu an injustice
 - with book in hand - )
 
"I sell myths not poems. With each poem goes a little myth. This myth is
not in the poem. It's in my mind. And when the editors of magazines ask
me for poems I make them pay for my work by passing along these little
myths which I make up. These myths appear at the end of the magazine
under the heading ABOUT CONTRIBUTORS or above my poems in italics. Very
soon there are as many myths as there are poems and ultimately this is
good because each poem does, this way, bring another poet into the world.
With this secret method of defying birth controls I populate the world
with poets."
- A. Codrescu.
 
A culture's artistic productions do influence the masses and its mores
etc. - thus the "myths" which surround its creator are also influential
on a people. It seems trite to even try to say this today considering PBS
and the NEA seem to "threaten" some Americans. But at one time poets
could boast a somewhat powerful position in society. I thought the
Codrescu  quote also ties in nicely with Shelley's use of the
symbolic Aeolian harp - wind creating music through an instrument (ie.
external influences creating the impetus for artistic expression which thereby
influences others).
 
my own top ten would probably include:
D H Lawrence, Charles Bukowski, Richard Kostelanetz, Charles Bernstein,
Anna Akhmatova, Bill Shields, James Magorian, Edna St. Vincent Millay,
Andrei Codrescu, Edward Foster, Christian Prigent & Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill
 (oops that is 12)

I think Minnesota's most comfortable with its literary heroes never setting
foot here. I understand that next year they (I guess I should say we, if 2
years makes me a minnesotan) will get around to a grand celebration of F.
Scott Fitzgerald's centenary year. He who lived in St. Paul and apparently
disliked it, and the local burghers, rather intensely. I think I understand
his social and economic theses better since living here. The west was just a
different place. Perhaps the combination of centuries-old ruins and
centuries-old active cultures in the area, being part of the life one
actually notices on something close to a daily basis(in Arizona, that is),
combined with the comparatively early settlement of the Spanish, makes the
southwest seem mature to me in comparison with this Minnesota place. But it
just may be some sense of my own foreignness here which makes me want to see
it as lacking.
 
all best,
charles

Please find attached an announcement for a conference on French
feminism. We would appreciate it very much if you could post this
to other appropriate lists.
 
                     CALL FOR PAPERS
The 30th Annual Texas Tech Comparative Literature Symposium
        "French Feminism Across the Disciplines"
                January 30-February 1, 1997
 
Plenary speakers will include:
 
            Barbara Harlow, University of Texas
            Peggy Kamuf, University of Southern California
            Toril Moi, Duke University
            Micaela Janan, Duke University
 
     This conference seeks to explore French feminism as it is deployed
in a variety of disciplines: literary, cultural and theoretical. We will
problematize French feminism as a discourse which cannot be contained
by any of the normative disciplinary categories of American academia.
The symposium, directed by Professors Hafid Gafaiti, Paul Allen Miller and
Sharon Diane Nell, welcomes papers representing the full range of
positions in this on-going debate. Abstracts of 20-minute papers should
be sent to Professor Nell (Department of Classical and Modern Languages
and Literatures, Texas Tech University, Box 2071, Lubbock, TX   79409-2071;
internet: n7sdn@ttacs1.ttu.edu; Phone: 806/742-3237; Fax: 806/742-3306)
not later than September 30, 1996. It is hoped that a volume of the best
papers resulting from the symposium will be subsequently published.
Inquiries may be addressed to the directors at the departmental address
listed above.
 
Please circulate this notice.

to submit, Chris, meaning is conjugal and this sort of joining is exactly
the sort I speak/write of here; that meaning is the social derivative of
dash, the mnemonic condition of it; meaning persists, is elongated in these
lines. What else do you concede our attention to it? That taken _alone_
(something I sense impossible) the gesture subverts meaning -- I don't get
you, and would like to...

Loss:
 
For ways of talking about sound, some thoughts:
 
1) Garrett Stewart's Reading Voices (U of California P, 1990) takes up the
ways in which silent reading processes a text in a zone of response somewhere
between "a merely evoked aurality and an oral vocalizing."  The chapter
titles--"To Hear With Eyes": Shakespeare as Proof Text, "An Earsighted
View": Joyce's "Modality of the Audible," Silence Speaking Words--suggest
Stewart's interest in the "phonotext" inherent in phonetic writing.  He
develops a vocabulary and set of procedures for a practice he calls
"phonemic reading."  The epilogue contains a virtuoso reading of the
skywriting scene in *Mrs Dalloway"
 
2)  Duncan's *H.D. Book* contains an amazing reading of her poem "Heat,"
with close attention to the tone-leading of vowels in the poem
 
3)  Kristeva on the semiotic & Barthes on the grain of the voice
 
4)  Nate Mackey's essay "Cante Moro" in the collection edited by Anne
Waldman from Naropa: this is the one on duende which came up earlier on
the net.  Also *Bedouin Hornbook.*
 
5)  Cage, of course
 
6)  Recently I've been reading *what to listen for in jazz* by Kernfeld
in order to eventually get to *Thinking in Jazz* by Berliner.  Kernfeld's
book is packaged with a CD, which means it has aural footnotes.
 
7)  Stephen Feld's essay "Aesthetics as Iconicity of Style, or
'Lift-Up-Over Sounding': Getting into the Kaluli Groove" in Yearbook for
Traditional Music 20 (1988): 74-113.
 
8)  Also, as was already mentioned, Kahn and Whitehead's *Wireless
Imagination* and the Radiotexte issue of *Semiotexte*
 
What else?  I'm looking forward to hearing more.
 
 
                                                Dee

New Yorkers on this list got the news Friday, but it's just found it's
way to L.A. and my guess is that it's skipped some points in between.
Henry Roth, author of _Call It Sleep_ died Friday.  His publishers
promise to continue with the series of novels he had already completed.

Many years ago a professor (I've forgotten whom) in a course I was taking
explained the dashes as meaning nothing at all.  She used a quill
pen to write with, he explained, the sort that dried out quickly once
lifted from the page.  To keep the pen from doing that, she would draw it
along the paper while thinking of what to write next.  So the dashes mean
nothing in themselves and simply indicate, at that point in the poem, that
Emily was wondering what to write next.

This legacy, if real, is odd (though it probably is real)--since Pound,
esp., but also some of the others, thought of themselves as something like
Public Intellectuals without Portfolio (though I guess Eliot had a
Portfolio), and since Pound and Olson, say, share not only the didactic
strain adumbrated by von Halberg but also the passion for the so-called
factive.  If this IS a "legacy of aesthetic modernism," though, then were
poets before the moderns public intellectuals?  Wordsworth and Tennyson (I
guess so).  Emerson, sure.  But Whitman?
 
I'm embarrassed not to have read Bob Perelman's modernism book yet--but can
he or it be drawn into this thread?

Dear Bill, hi, it's Kevin Killian.  I wrote away to the FBI for Jack

negative.  I do know that FBI had a number of poets under surveillance here
in San Francisco in the late 50s and have spoken to some who were
interviewed by FBI.  John Wieners was a special target, as were Joe Dunn
and George Stanley.  Lovers of conspiracy theory might ponder fate of Dunn
and Wieners (wish I could get THEM to write away for their files!) and
George, of course, left California for safer shores of Vancouver BC.

I hear all the discussion about "Poetry in Motion" and hope that you all on
the list serv also get a chance to see Ron Mann's subsequent film
"TWIST"-it is a cultural history of the Twist (dance crazy of early 60's).
 
Hank Ballard was deprived of fame with the Twist after Dick Clark heard his
version of the song and assigned one of his stooges at Cameo-Parkway
(Phila. record label) to do a cover version.
 
Starring former back-up singer whoMrs Dick Clark named "Chubby Checker"
because she thought it would be a cuter name than "Ernie."
 
Also, her homage to "Fats Domino."  In the wake of great success of "The
Twist," lots of twist-king-wannabes changed their names with varying
degrees of success, including Jumbo Chess and (my favorite) Pudgy
Parcheesi.  Go see "Twist," you will enjoy it, except the Canadians on this
list, who will feel that Ron Mann has lost some of his essential
Canadianism, the quality that makes "Poetry in Motion" such a weird viewing
experience.

Ken's right about the way in which media-poetry-events tends to expose
sensitive souls like him and me to embarrassment (at best) and potential
ridicule.  The Niedecker don't-let-em-know approach isn't open to me,
raising children in a small town ("Lottie's mum says she read one of your
poems in the bookshop last week and couldn't understand it" etc), and like
Ken, I'm used to yawning gaps in pub conversations on these occasions. The
top ten was a continuation of an event, then, not an event in itself -
but here, by way of a diversion, is my phantasy cricket team:
 
1. Geoffrey Chaucer
2. Basil Bunting
        - a pair of seasoned openers, to wear down any attack -
3. Thomas Wyatt
4. Jack Spicer
5. Lorine Niedecker
6. Peter Riley
        - mid-order with a range of strokes, and some amazing slip
        catching -
7. Kit Smart
        - how about this? a keeper who can strike out a bit -
8. Marianne Moore
        - "always include a spinner" - G.Arlott -
9. Elaine Randell
        - English seam bowling at its most accurate, with some amazing
        turn when the weather's overcast (which it usually is) -
10. William Carlos Williams
11. Alice Notley
        - the pace attack. OK, I've sacrificed on accuracy here in favour
        of awesome speed, length and height -
 
[12th man - Alan Halsey - very adaptable and quick in the field...]
 
OK - Ken, about those worst poems, I started to think about it - Amy

Gwyn--Thanks for the explanation.  Surely MFA programs (at least most, I
hope) do encourage their students to raise their awareness of the
possibilities of poetry beyond what has already been done.  I do wonder,
though, if they and the _academic_ poetry they are often charged with
fostering has something to do with the differences many list members are
commenting on between public acceptance of the graphic arts and poetry.
I wonder how many people who consider themselves avid readers but
who don't read much if any poetry written after Frost might trace their
aversion to modern or postmodern poetry as a result of academic
influence.  Perhaps some feel that poetry has been taken away from them
by the academics.  Recent articles on _academic_ poetry suggest as much,
particularly one published about a year ago in _The Chronicle of Higher
Education_.  I haven't seen much about it since, but MFA bashing seems to
have had a bit of a day.
 
If anything I say here makes sense, I wonder why the graphic arts
haven't suffered a similar fate.  Have MFA programs been so much more
effective at taking poetry away from the people than art departments at
appropriating painting, sculpture, etc.?

    "free verse" or "blank verse" at first find her work offputting for
    that--and others of course find it somewhat reassuring for that--and
    the rhymes and rhythm does lend her work a more memorizable quality
    than much unrhyming work of contemporaries...I don't think the "avant-
    garde" Dickinson is any more real than the "mainstream" Dickinson--
    I guess that's the "agenda" behind most of my postings on her....
    And maybe Burt has got the best take at all--the dashes are just
    pauses in thought (while the ink dripped from the quill---Burt that's
    absolutely deliciously perverse!)

Bart, I think one reason that graphic arts MFA programs are less often
bashed than their writing counterparts is that graphic-arts programs tend
to be quite strictly studio-oriented, while writing programs swing
through a wide range from very *studio*-oriented to very *academic.*
AWP's Guide to Writing Programs includes a brief introductory section
laying out loose guidelines for what constitutes "studio" and what
constitutes "academic"; these guidelines are by no means "received" and are
intended mainly to help aspiring applicants decide what kind of program
they want to apply to. Many programs, to justify their existence and
increase the future employability of their graduates, feel compelled to
include a strong academic component, through lit requirements, killer
comps, whatever. But some don't, and are more like graphic-arts MFAs in
their design. To me, it seems like writing MFA programs with that strong
academic component are thus more open to charges that they purvey a sort
of "academic" poetic. And I do think that's at least partly true.

That the dashes could be pauses in thought, based on ink
technology--interesting, though as a rollerball convert, I wouldn't know
anything about it.  But it's odd to me that this means they "mean"
nothing at all--I'm not sure we could ever mean anything if we didn't
pause all the time, or, more properly, some of the time.  And one wants
to know, why here, what's she found and what's she searching for?  I
wouldn't posit an absence of meaning in a pause, only to say the presence
of meaning is (I guess) in the words themselves.  What's appealing about
this argument-from-technology is that it shows the mechanics
of thought, and the mechanics of writing, as a negotiation between
something like a positivist ideal of getting the meanings down in words
and a negativist (?) awareness (not an ideal!) that squirming words exceed
the squamous mind.  Yeah, they mean "nothing" at all.  Pages of
illustrations.  (Apologies for mixing my poets.)

The theory that Dickinson's dashes result from pauses for thought
doesn't fit the nature of her manuscripts very well.  They generally
aren't working drafts; most of them are in booklets she put together
with a lot of care for the inscription.  She wasn't putting extra
punctuation in by accident when she made these booklets.
 
Dickinson's "eccentricity" in punctuation is also not very odd if you
look at other nineteenth-century manuscripts, rather than at the
tidied-up versions that publishers and printers created from such
manuscripts.  A lot of people used dashes in abundance at the time; if
Dickinson is unusual it is in how she used them, rather than in their
mere presence.

Bart: Here's where I have to defend MFA programs. Though I have recently
stated my concerns with the the way the workshop (which I see as something
of an institution, like the classroom, the boardroom, the halls of state,
etc., and so feel free to generalize away) tend to consolidate the criteria
for what has to be called judgment (in much the same way that Eng. Depts.
inevitably develop canons), I take exception to the claim that MFA
programs have "taken poetry from the people."
     When did the people have poetry, Bart? Poetry, by definition, is
a highly elite activity. Always has been. Sure there have been
exceptional practitioners, but c'mon, when have dockworkers, or more
in my world, checkers in Wal-Mart, ever really cared about Chaucer,
or Ashbery?
     I know that MFA programs have allowed more people of color, of
class, of anything, to spend a life reading and writing poetry than
ever before. If anything, MFA programs have opened up literature to
"the people" as you call them, in unprecedented numbers. I know that
because I was one of them. If it wasn't for the academy generally, or
the workshop specifically, I would now, do not doubt, be working
construction or service, as are everyone I grew up with.
 
 
     Yes, the workshop has produced for nearly fifty years a kind of uniform
poetry, but it has nothing to do with the fact that it took poetry away from
the people. In fact, it may have to do with the fact that it was trying to make
poetry more accessible, more teachable, to folks who had no access to it
early. I don't think it was neccessary to do that, and I find it even
condescending. But there it is. I hope, now, that we can move on.
     Thanks, Eric.

terms. Numberic retrieval limits may be set for a) full records displayed,
b) short records displayed, and c) titles displayed. There is online help,
and the ability to ask questions.
 
What you find is description in some detail: example -- currently, a search
simply on "Nom d'artiste: gauguin" will obtain a list of 42 title entries,
and the same search restricted to "Limitation aux documents avec image"
yields the following two records, with very nice accompanying GIF inline
images which blow up very well on an America Online viewer:
 
1) Gauguin, Paul [link to full list of 42 JOCONDE entries maintained for
his works] , "Nature Morte aux Oranges" [link to full record -- and
accompanying image -- of the holdings entry for the original work], (1882
avant); Rennes; Muse'e des Beaux - Arts; peinture a` l'huile; toile; 33H,
46L; Mille'sime: 1882 avant; Repre'sentation: nature morte (vaisselle,
orange fruit, couteau, bouteille); Gene`se: avec oeuvre apparentee connue;
 
2) Gauguin, Paul [same link to full list of JOCONDE entries for Gauguin];
"Vase de Fleurs" [same link to full holdings record, and inline image];
(1880 vers); Rennes; Muse'e des Beaux - Arts; peinture a` l'huile; toile;
19H, 27L; Mille'sime: 1880 vers; Repre'sentation: nature morte (vase,
bouquet, livre, fenetre, balustrade), maison, ciel; Gene`se: avec oeuvre

There is an astonishing richness here: not only of images and information
and access points and indexing, but also of openness to the general public
and overall effort. I am aware of a few extraordinary efforts under way in
other countries to organize and mount such a service, but of none so
advanced yet as this of the French.
 
Where are the multimedia presentations, featuring text and sound and links,
all the accompaniment which a good cdrom on the subject might have? One
suspects that all this is not far behind. In the meantime a user has all
the advantages of online over cdrom -- currency, greater availability
(Joconde, the online service, may be reached from anywhere -- in airplanes
now -- at any time, regardless of whether you've brought your cdrom drive
along), constant updating of data and system features -- Joconde is a work
- in - progress, and will grow as France's extraordinary effort in online
media grows.
 
Some of us may remember Andre' Malraux: "... And if, after so many years of
oblivion, we hear the song that follows after a plainsong of a crusade or a
chant of the Ramayana, it is not because the historians have restored the
text to us, or because we have rediscovered the faith of the twelfth
century or of the age of the Vedas; it is because we admire them in the
company of the statues of Sumer and of the Indian grottoes, of the
Acropolis and of the tombs of Florence -- in the company of all the statues
of the earth. It is the song of metamorphosis, and no one before us has
heard it -- the song in which esthetics, dreams, and even religions are no
longer more than librettos to an inexhaustible music."

Hey, I recall a mention of, perhaps, a student of Edward Said's who

Who was this?  Or was it said?  Where?  Any responses would be helpful.

Subject:      Reception : and the top Ten
 
"Our problem so often seems to be that while we persist in producing
texts as opaque or offensive as modernist texts (its a measure of
their criticality) we take no pleasure, feel no glee, no superiority,
when they get the same reception. "  W. Curnow
 
While tending toward the self-abusive, the possibility that poetry's
'marginal' cultural space is a design flaw seems worth thinking
about.  Two easy 'eithers' follow: 1) poetry could mainstream
itself by changing its devices, getting the old shoes polished
and the suit pressed (viz: MTV and GAP appropriations, some would
argue; though here opacity and disjunction are re-framed, made
familiar) or, 2) learn to value an inevitably unappreciated cultural
position.
 
Both 'either's seem to me stuck within the conception (though
surely almost all would deny) that implicitly mainstream/visibility/
popularity are aims.  To argue otherwise is NOT to stake down an
elitest or disengaged tent party, not necessarily.
 
Even an avowedly political or revolutionary poetry might
aim to engage a 'local' (in capital logic: marginal)
audience, and think this sufficient, even preferable to
Global reception.  In some circles Seamus Heaney's latest laurel
taints him, no?

Doctor-Patient confidentiality makes it hard to get that sort of
information without the request from Kaufman's family. In the 70s and
early 80s, there were active anti-electroconvulsive therapy movements
in California and elsewhere (the Network Against Psychiatric Assault in
SF being one of the better known). They might know how to get this sort
of info and some of their activists (e.g., Wade Hudson who may be in
the SF phone book) could steer you in the right direction.
 
Stephen Schwartz, the neocon writer for the SF Chronicle, was an active
participant of the National Seamens Union before he discovered the joys
of capital, and must certainly have known Kaufman (Schwartz was a poet
for 20 years or so). He would be a logical place to start on that
track.

Four days before London's Albert Hall is filled with holes (how many?), the
UK has voted Kipling's 'If' its favourite poem with Tennyson's 'Lady of
Shalott' and de la Mare's 'The Listeners' the runners-up. Stevie Smith was
the only modern rhymester to make the top ten.
 
But the punch line - in a national telephone poll sponsored by the BBC and
extensively 'advertised' around prime-time slots (TV & radio), and out of a
'Nation' of c. 60m people, only 7,500 actually registered their favourite.
 
Poetics and the Media orbit far distant stars.

The Corona Palimpsest
 
"If you burn a book, it opens unto absence in the flame. If you
drown it, it unfolds with the wave. If you bury it, it quenches
the thirst of the desert..."
                                                        -- Edmond Jabes
 
Ligorano/Reese are creating a new installation on view at CristineRose
Gallery in Soho called The Corona Palimpsest. This installation, along
with other video installations and limited edition works by
Ligorano/Reese question the changing roles of the book, electronic
information, and television.
 
Their new work is about hidden vestiges and the markings that
remain. A palimpsest, by definition, is a tablet or parchment that has
been erased and used over, leaving traces of the old text under the
new. The Corona Palimpsest at CristineRose is a room-size installation
featuring two handbound volumes. In one, there are over 300 hand-
painted pages composed of images from the spectacular coverage of
the Gulf war to Warlpiri cave paintings. Media images, air-brushed
stencils, rubbings and silhouettes of newspaper and magazine photos
spill over this book's pages. The other volume is a blank, burned
book, apparently empty, yet also, a complete text that stands as a
testiment to degradation and destruction.
 
Both volumes contain video monitors in their centers. These liquid
crystal display (LCD) monitors show, in the painted book, a magical
text. On this video screen, the reader sees an electronic poem
composed of digitally manipulated fragments. Texts by Gertrude
Stein, H.D., Frida Kahlo, William Burroughs, Gerrit Lansing, Ezra Pound,
Robert Creeley, J.G. Ballard, and others have been used. The blank
book, suspended by chains from the walls and ceiling, shows
computer-enhanced faces that peer out from the video in its center.
At CristineRose, this book looks over The Corona Palimpsest and its
readers, projecting an eerie range of intentions -- beatification,
vigilence, surveillance. The viewer is confronted not only by two
different representations of the book, but also by the fact that to see
them they must walk over 600 trade hardbacks. These form a carpet
on the floor to make up a black and white grid. This carpet, in
essence, presents a dilemma but it also suggests volume and measure.
 
Ligorano/Reese's new installation is about the continuity of culture
and language, when contemporary society seems to strive for their
disruption. It commemorates the making of the book into a
theoretical abstraction charted by such writers as Stephane Mallarme,
Edmond Jabes, and Robert Duncan. It acknowleges that today, the
book has become a concept that attracts metaphors and tropes like a
divining rod. As a "power book," it symbolizes the concept of
possibility with an infinite magnitude of importance. As a volume of
pages, the book consolidates auratic significance and provenance.
 
The installation at CristineRose is about this displacement. Whether
one considers the book an historical object, or not, the artists
embellish on the book's role, while at the same time, they negate it.
In a very real way, they have displaced text and image. They have
created books containing texts without words. As books, the volumes
of The Corona Palimpsest are static. In a gallery, no one will
manipulate their pages; only the video moves. The book as a carrier
of information has been converted into an artifact, a relic.
Ligorano/Reese point to a rapidly approaching future, when the role
of the book will be further changed, perhaps even diminished, in our
culture.
 
Granary Books (568 Broadway, New York, NY 10012) will publish a
limited edition of The Corona Palimpsest in spring 1996.
 
If any poetics listserv subscribers are in NYC over the dates of the
show, we hope you can see it...

Marshall,
        I've re-posted this to friends in New York, and it sounds very
interesting.  Does this work in any way comment upon or refer to Anselm
Kiefer's "The Burning of the Rural District of Buchen VII," or
"Iconoclastic Controversy"?--is there influence?  I've contemplated this
work for some time, particularly the books, and have resisted the
discomfort induced by the hyperbole surrounding his public reception, but
have found certain ambiguities in the work troubling.  Still, the books
remain with me...

Tenney...I was thinking that the ideology of distanciation and autonomy
helped create a critical divide between "true" intellectuals (guys at
Oxbridge) and "public intellectuals" (usually thought to be journalists
and/or non-academic types, although much of the Old Left would seem to
apply). And that when nostalgic newer Left types like Jacoby searched around
for a continuing radical tradition he had no choice but to vaunt the second
choice. But you're right about the pre-modernists. Without knowing what
Jacoby would say, they would qualify in the sense that they (Tennyson
surely) had large, public readership and wrote on a variety of subjects
social and political and cultural.

i've got to say, quite the contrary, in my observation.  since most
literature departments are tending toward "theory" these days, and most
contemporary theory attacks the tenets of what is generally called "academic
poetry," those MFA programs that resist theory in favor of practice more
often uphold --unconsciously, since they believe their values are "timeless"
--an earlier, outmoded academicism.  It's my belief, and i could be wrong,
that if mfa students read more benjamin and foucault they'd be likely to
write more adventurously than if they restricted their reading to, say,
robert lowell and anne sexton.  granted, this is based on anecdotal and
personal observation, which is limited to the institutions i inhabit.
 apologies to those of you to whom this is unfair and whom it doesn't
characterize.--md

Subject:      Albert Hall
 
Dateline 16.10.95; Ken Edwards reporting.
 
At 7.30pm, the scheduled time of starting, the vast cavern of the Albert Hall is
barely one-sixth full. If it holds 8,000 people capacity, then there are fewer
than 1,500 here. Still, that's a lot for a poetry reading, I suppose.
 
I encountered Lawrence Upton by chance, and we found we'd bought cut-price
tickets from the same ticket tout, so we ended up sitting together way up in the
balcony, to the left of the stage. Red plush seating; above the stage, a giant
blue video screen which darkens to show the message "poetry has been a
prohibited substance". Lawrence tells me there were rumours Paul McCartney was
going to make a guest appearance with Ginsberg; if so, it doesn't seem to have
caused an audience rush. He also says he's heard from Bill Sherman, who is
apparently on the programme tonight. I am incredulous. A young guy next to us
hears the name Bill Sherman and reveals Bill was an old friend of his father's
"and is like a legend to me. That's why I'm here; I don't know anything about
poetry."
 
The lights go down, and on the video screen is projected black & white film of
Ginsberg chanting in the same arena 30 years ago; it's part of Peter Whitehead's
1965 film "Wholly Communion" I guess. Then the first poet comes on.
 
BRIAN CATLING: In dark suit, holding a mirror vertically in front of his face so
that his video image, projected above him, shows him with a cyclopean single
eye, no nose and tiny goldfish mouth. Apocalyptic, gothic; sample quotes
(apologies for mishearings): "masked in silver and burnt sand", "throat knotted
to a glass", "a swinery worn pink to the weight of gold".
 
AARON WILLIAMSON: Dressed all in black. Aaron is profoundly deaf; on the page, a
highly cerebral writer (I recommend his "A Holythroat Symposium" from Creation
Books), onstage, his language dissolves into strangulated phonemes, stretched
out syllables, explosive movement. His powerful, visceral sound echoes badly in
the hall. He gets a good reception.
 
At this point, compere Michael Moorcock makes his first appearance. It is a
performance of staggering incompetence. He introduces "three London poets", who
are using the city as some kind of Gothic stage for their work - eulogising
Aidan Dun first, but calling him "Andrew Dun". Then Iain Sinclair. Finally,
Denise Riley. How on earth Denise fits into this schema I don't know, since
neither London nor Gothickery plays any part in her work. He reveals, however,
that he has only read Denise's work this evening, and bizarrely goes on to
recommend her book "Mop Mop Georgette" (published by yours truly/W Mulford): "so
good it's almost collpasing in on itself". He collapses into incoherence: "Who's
on first? I can't remember."
 
AIDAN DUN: In blue scarf, playing acoustic guitar. Launches into part of his
epic London poem, irritating whispery voice. Sample quote: "I found the people
of the golden skin bathing." A Donovan de nos jours, methinks.
 
DENISE RILEY: In black. She told me she'd been desperately nervous all week.
However, her voice is steady and surprisingly resonant. She reads "Laibach
Lyrik" from "Mop Mop" very well.
 
IAIN SINCLAIR: The eminence grise behind this venture, I fancy. Reads three
poems, homages to Henry James (with references to the Great Train Robber Charlie
Richardson), Keats and Blake. OK. Then introduces a film made by Chris Petit
last week of David Gascoyne, now in his 80s, reading a poem in his home on the
Isle of Wight. Couldn't hear properly. Bespectacled, quite sprightly.
 
CRIS CHEEK: First Sianed Jones walks on stage looking sexy in a black
mini-dress, playing electric violin with maximum fuzz and feedback. Cris leaps
up onto the stage from the audience playing clarinet, which he does rather well
these days. Also in black. Has everyone been given instructions about this?
Sianed moves to portable harmonium, wailing. Cris intones, holding a lampstand
with Xmas tree lights blinking on and off on the end of it (I may be quite wrong
about this; what was that about, Cris?). Stage darkened by now, Cris screaming.
Sample soundbite: "so parsimonious, so acrimonious, so sanctimonious". He shreds
paper ("I wrote a poem about it somewhere"). Heavy breathing from Sianed. Cris
on his knees as the lights come up; they both do a wordless vocal duet. End.
Excellent audience reception.
 
Michael Moorcock returns, now in self-parody mode ("Here I am with another
incompetent announcement"). The announcement is the winner of the poetry
competition. And it turns out to be: Bill Sherman! So that's how he got on the
programme. He reads the winning poem which appears to be a collaborative
translation from a prominent Tahitian poet. (This morning I check the
competition rules: "The poem must be ... in English and must be the unaided work
of the author". Hmm.)
 
MIKE HOROVITZ: Not in black, playing Jerusalem on the kazoo. Announces Kathy
Acker couldn't make it but Anne Waldman will be appearing instead. Sonnet in
sing-song voice. A poem to his mother, who died this year aged 100. "Now a
protest poem on behalf of fish" (which is a homage to Joyce and Schwitters).
Update of Wordsworth's Westminster Bridge sonnet, and poem to Frances Horovitz.
(Later, Miles Champion tells me he enjoyed this, but I can't help invoking
Donovan again; to me, Horovitz was always Donovan to Ginsberg's Dylan.)
 
At the interval, Lawrence and I migrate down to the arena. Many people up in the
gods have had the same idea, which means the arena is threequarters-full for the
second half, giving a better atmosphere. It begins with another showing for part
of the Peter Whitehead film.
 
BENJAMIN ZEPHANIAH: White middle-class poetry folk's favourite Rasta gets
recognition applause when he comes on. A performer with the timing of a class
comedian, but while his routines are entertaining I've always found his material
lame.
 
The second compere, Howard Marks, comes on, in white open-necked shirt and brown
suit. Reads a long intro. Gets obvious recognition. I still don't know who he
is; at the risk of sounding like a High Court judge ("who are the Beatles?") can
someone help me?
 
DOUGLAS OLIVER: At one time, I accorded Doug Oliver god-like status, and I still
think his 1970s books "In the Cave of Suicession" and "The Diagram Poems" are
two of the finest of that era. I'm not quite so keen on his current output,
which I find rather solemn at times. He reads a poem he describes as a homage to
the nomads of Somalia, which contains some stuff about female circumcision
(which he disapproves of) and a rather sombre poem called "The Oracle of the
Drowned". Yellow jacket, blue shirt.
 
ALICE NOTLEY: Much more lively, I thought. In red with black trousers. Three
poems: set in New York, the Mojave Desert and Paris, France, she says. The first
plays on poetry and money. The second contains the line(s) "I think we already
know what death's like - there are moments in life we are dead", but the effect
is darkly humorous rather than sombre. By now, the audience has adopted the
habit of applauding each individual poem.
 
BRENDAN KENNELLY: Reads an absolutely hilarious long poem about James Joyce
having dinner with the Holy Family in Nazareth ("Joyce's short answers were
buggering the dinner up"; "'What family is wholly holy?' said Jesus"). Then "My
Dark Fathers" (I think), a poem about the Famine. Spoils it all with a poem
about a child asking questions, which I found a tad sentimental.
 
SORLEY MACLEAN: A great man, now in his 80s. Reads standing at the back of the
stage; first in his sonorous English, then in his even more sonorous Gaelic
original. He apologises for one: "Not a happy poem either".
 
Howard Marks announces the winning programme number; the winner gets their
programme autographed by the poets.
 
TOM PICKARD: "Last time I stood here was 1986 at the end of the miners' strike."
His "manifesto of fuck" is loved by the audience. Ends with variations on the
name Saatchi & Saatchi.
 
ANNE WALDMAN: Like Alice, in red and black. Uses lectern. Witchlike delivery.
Sonnet after Philip Sidney, ends "we're stuck with each other's heart now".
Highly rhetorical, panting. "I magnetise the phone bill". Finally, a homage to
John Cage, "Pieces of an hour", a virtuoso piece of sprechstimme.
 
ALLEN GINSBERG: Multiple roadies set up for him: two chairs (significant), a
table with a coffee-cup, ferns in pots, mikes. Comes on to great acclaim. I find
his first poem incredibly moving in its wry, humorous acceptance of death and
dissolution ("What a mess I am, Allen Ginsberg"; "Allen Ginsberg warns you:
don't follow my path to extinction"). And then, yes, Paul McCartney comes on
stage in white shirt, grey pants and sneakers, with a semi-acoustic guitar which
he plugs in. Accompanies Ginsberg on a long skeleton song. Walks off, leaving
Ginsberg to take the applause.
 
Which dies down soon after he's left the stage. The audience disperses. It's
past 11pm. I briefly talk in the foyer to Cris, Denise, Miles Champion, Ira
Lightman, Robert Hampson, Peter Barry and Mike Hart from Compendium, who's
running the bookstall. Decline the possibility of the post-gig party and find a
bus home.
 
Apologies again for all mishearings and misquotes. Ken Edwards signing off.

I haven't been reading the list as assiduouly as I have in the past and I
periodically tune in to find out who is writing and what they are writing
about. My reading today was after five days of not erasing my messages,
so I got an interesting cross-section of material and a definite sampling
that leads me to wonder what the drive is behind all the "evaluation"
that is going on.
 
Ron and Michael and others writing about how to evaluate the situation of
the teacher/poet. How do we feel about it? What are its drawbacks? How is
Michael expressing his concern in his work, while referred to is not
detailed, while a lot of space is devoted to whether it's good or bad.
This meta-discourse is similar to the blackout on the content of the
women's conferences in China. The papers blared how to evaluate the
situation by the extent of opressive behavior by Chinese soldiers which
is to my mind largely irrelevant to the conferences and thier important
findings. My question is how have we so distanced ourselves from the
material we seek to address? How can we talk about it? What are the terms
of the discussion?
 
The other primary set of messages today are about evaluating the top ten
lists that have been developing. This level of evaluation easier to
understand and might shed light on the previous issue if only I could
understand  who it is these correspondents are evaluating.
 
Although this is I admit again a discussion at a "respectful" distance.
What do you who addressed these subjects today and previous think about
your writing these messages?
 
Pat Phillips' particles were illuminating in that context at least at the
beginning of the message.
 
I can't believe I have the time to write to the list.

Subject:      Dash it, Emily!
Comments: To: cohar@conncoll.edu
 
>some scholars claimed that the dashes have a relatively exact _musical_
>function, indicating not only duration of "rest" (we have no notation for
>"rests," as such, in language)
 
I'm not sure whether they count as "rests" per se, but commas, semicolons,
colons, full stops (periods for Americans), dashes, parentheses and ellipses
all seem to notate pauses of varying lengths, in addition to/as part of their
syntactic functions. I've seem them used in non-standard ways to great effect -
I once read a novel in which one of the characters had a very clipped,
mechanical way of speaking, which was represented by. using. a. full. stop.
after. each. word.
 
There are other typographical techniques for including a rhythmic score in a
poem - line breaks of course, the use of a slash/stroke/solidus in the middle
of a line, Olson's open parenthesis, etc. These all have various rhythmical
effects as well as introducing subtle syntactic and semantic ambiguities.
 
Once I played around with a simple text-to-speech converter on a PC (it's the
one included with Soundblaster cards), and since there was a strict
correspondence between punctuation and intonation/timing, I was able to put
very precise pauses between words,,,,,, by using the,,, right,, number of
commas. One could also invoke a rising intonation via question marks, but? why?
would? anyone? want? to? do? that?
 
 
Incidentally, it's almost a pity that the theory of ED's dashes being pauses
for thought while the ink dries appears to be dubious. This would be a
wonderful example of the poem being a trace of the writing process - the poet's
hesitancies and contemplations leaving a physical mark on the page. There are
no doubt a thousand ways in which one could write these processes in/as a poem.

Loss,
   Poetry in Motion 2 is advertised in the Voyager
catalog, but it has not been released yet far as I know. Issa,
do you know what's happening with that title? I have no
idea what kind of a project it is -- though there's an image
of Bob Creeley used on the cover in the catalog. Does anyone on this
list have have work which appears as part of that project?
The Poetry in Motion cd-rom which *is* out *is* and
adaptation of the film/video by Ron Mann. There are a couple
of nice features to the cd-rom, the addition of biographical material
& alphabetic texts of the performance pieces. In all, though, the
video is more fluid, and *looks* better on the tv screen than on the
computer. As I mentioned in the piece the other day, Video doesn't translate
all that well to cd-rom as it is today. At best
you can get a 3"x4" moving screen, & depending on how fast
the computer's processor is can be rather slow-moving or grainy.
Baraka don't look & move as good Wailin' on the cd-rom, etc.
The technology is changing quickly, though, & before long there
will be better technology, cd-roms will probably be obsolete
within a half a decade or so. Nevertheless - digital multimedia
is just beginning.
 
Any faculty out there care to express their opinions on
"long distance learning"?

Subject:      Re: Top ten poems
 
The BBC poll on top 10 poems comes at the same time as a Sunday Times survey on
other arts, which was reported here in the Sunday Star/Times as the 10 GREATEST
plays/novels/composers/whatever. The use of the word GREATEST is likely to
invoke a response that mimics received ideas of Great Works (resulting in the
top 10 novels all being from the 19th Century), whereas BEST or FAVOURITE might
result in different, more personal response. In addition, the voluntary survey/
poll format will always bias the sample towards those who can at least name 10
poems, and who actually give a damn.
 
Now, in NZ, if the General Public (the capitalisation indicating an
abstraction) were asked to name 10 NZ poets, who might appear on such lists?
Here's my guess:
 
        1. Sam Hunt
        2. James K. Baxter
        3. Barry Crump (he tells Scotty a "poem" on the Toyota ads)
        4. Laura Ranger
        5. Cilla McQueen (_Dogwobble_ keeps popping up everywhere)
        6. Lauris Edmond
        7. Bill Manhire
        8. Allen Curnow/"Whim Wham"
        9. Bub Bridger (at least among Wellingtonians)
       10. Kevin Ireland
 
Also, they'd probably recognise the names Keri Hulme, Janet Frame, Gary
McCormick, Peter Bland, C.K. Stead and Fiona Kidman, but not associate them
with poetry.
 
As a piece of self-indulgence, here's my first XI (but not in batting order):
 
        Edwin Morgan
        Dennis Lee
        Dinah Hawken
        Leigh Davis
        Bill Manhire
        Geoffrey Hill (at least _Mercian Hymns_)
        Michele Leggott
        James Brown (no, not _that_ James Brown)
        James Norcliffe
        Craig Raine
        Geoff Cochrane
 
        with T.S. Eliot as coach.
 
Oops, no Americans (unless you count the Possum) - blame it on my Anglocentric
upbringing. At least they could probably play cricket better than the NZ
cricket team.
 
Incidentally, that issue of the Sunday Star-Times also contained letters
stating that McCahon was not an artist and that no-one wants to listen to NZ
music - all that nasty avant-garde rubbish. Brrrr!!! Scary.

Yup, PiM 2 is out, shipping, all that. I have the box here in front of me;
the back lists these poets:
 
(also on the first disc)
Helen Adam, Amiri Baraka, Ted Berrigan, Charles Bukowski, Jim Carroll,
Robert Creeley, Diana (!whoops!) di Prima, Allen Ginsberg, John Giorno,
Michael Ondaatje, Gary Snyder, Anne Waldman
 
(CD-ROM premiere! heh)
Tom Clark, Spalding Gray, Bob Holman, Rose Lesniak, Cookie Mueller, Eileen
Myles, Alice Notley, Joel Oppenheimer, Peter Orlovsky, Pedro Pietri, Jerome
Rothenberg, & Philip Whalen
 
"In nine additional interviews hear Charles Bukowski explain why 'fiction
is an improvement upon life,' Diane di Prima talk about discovering Keats,
Jim Carroll admit to following his idol Frank O'Hara through the streets of
NY, and [the everpresent] more."
 
While I think the lack of video quality is frustrating, the promise (as you
mention) is in the ability to combine performance with written texts. Also,
this new disc might be more interesting because (I'm pretty sure) the
readings here aren't in the film.

dear tom,
         interested in your team. but you should know that Leigh Davis
doesn't play cricket. I'm glad you picked michele--I notice the UK teams
are unisex--but why do you have her as wicket-keeper? She'd never see
the ball! or, is that the idea? i mean who are your oponents, answer me
that? Will they beat India? And Eliot, as coach! He doesn't play cricket
either. Is that your idea of a joke? Groundsman maybe, especially if
you've packed the team with spinners.
        best,

I wish that were true here, but it isn't.  Theory in that sense doesn't
seem to rub off on the permanent writing faculty.  The folks in town here
who write what for lack of a better phrase is referred to as experimental
writing have no connection with the English department, with the exception
of a well-known guy (not Burroughs, not that well known) who ekes out a
living as a course-by-course lecturer with no benefits or security or
decent salary.  True story: a theory person was brought in for a job
interview who'd done 1/3 of his thesis on this guy, but nobody seemed to
get the point.
 
Anyway, theory applies to anything; theorists don't have to read new
writing from any or no coast.  (Another true story: the theorists invited
Rachel Blau du Plessis to speak, at least one of the inviters didn't know
she was a poet.)

We're talking about a particular period of 'english' for a particular
sensibility of (and possibly age or age identifcation of) reader. We're
talking short, mostly romantic or sentimental or patriotic nostalgia,
written in what is 'broadly speaking' the wellsprings of what's been called
either 'the Queen's English' or 'standard English' (BBC World Service).
We're witnessing idiosyncratic examples of 'pop' penetration. Kipling comes
on teacloths and the office jotter, Auden is back in the frame after the
success of Four Weddings and A Funeral. The top ten poets don't differ much
from the authors of the top ten poems. It's just what people feel safe with
-  also, and perhaps crucially, that poetry (in fact all proper validated
culture) is in 'the past'. Poems that fulfill a function similar to the
family heirloom  -  you might not really want granny's slipper in the house
but it is all that remains of her and so gathers respect and historical
curiosity as a reminder of 'the past'. This is underlines by the absence of
contemporary poets. For all their reported popularity there's no sign of
John Hegley, Carol Ann Duffy, Brian Patten, Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Pam
Ayres, Benjamin Zephaniah, Adrian Mitchell, Tony Harrison, Simon Armitage,
Craig Raine, Kit Wright and so on. Sorry to pollute this list quite so
incomprehensibly. Mostly we're talking about one poet known for only a half
dozen poems. I wonder how many people who voted for Yeats have a fondness
for his wonderful 'Crazy Jane' poems for example.
 
And Charles, the poets you mention:-

>Donne, Johnson, Smart, Gray, Wyatt, Sidney, Marvel, and many more? Or read

None of these writers are perceivable under 'the Queen's English'. Not only
are they as Ric says 'difficult', but many of them aren't approached until
Degree level. That's the result of an appallingly patronising education
system which is replicated in attitudes that drive down lowest common
denominators by insisting that one shouldn't write what the bus conductor
couldn't understand  -  when that bus conductor has a double first in
mathmatics but either doesn't want or simply can't get any other work.
Well, work that's a wholly different topic.

SC:  Well, it's nice to see some fellow Romantics on this list, but I have
to go along with Kenneth Sherwood and ask:  "failure to do what?"  Produce
easily-consumable product?  Huh-uh.  That's not something I've chosen to
try, myself.  Mass audiences tend to be such more out of force of habit than
anything else (I can't think of any exceptions to this off the top of my
head, so somebody correct me if I'm stepping off the deep end here), and
it's precisely our (Industrialized Nations') habits that are endangering
global humanity.  Certainly I want my own work, and poetry as such, to be
"accessible", but only so much so to draw an audience or readership out of
its habits of thought and into the world.  Too *little* accessibility
(through what would be the real elitism: either the physical withholding of
the texts as "pearls before swine" or through such obscurity that the reader
is driven away) and too *much* accessibility (which would seem to me to
necessitate a too-diluted poetic which would become merely a consumer habit,
feeding back into what I see as the problem) are the Scylla and Charybdis of
my poetics.  (Yikes!  I can't believe I said that that way!)

Wystan,

I reckon that you're probably right about poetry not making a comeback. While
some people point to an upturn in poetry cafes/pubs/whatever, this is largely
poetry as therapy, not poetry as an investigation into the possibilities and
limitations of language. To the extent that "poetry in our age _has_ to be
difficult" (probably a horrible misquote of Eliot), this kind of challenging
poetry in which the reader/listener has to take an active part in the
composition is never likely to have mass appeal.
 
Many of the functions of poetry (as aide memoire, as voice of the people, as
song) have been superceded by new media, and I don't see poetry ever claiming
back these territories. Poetry as explorer, charting the boundaries, skirting
the edge of the world, is _always_ going to be a minority pursuit. In this
sense it _will_ remain invisible, a failure on the great level-playing-field of
mass media. Poetry certainly _can_ play up to this "failure" to interesting
effect.
 
But "should"? I'm not convinced of this. I'd like to see poetry infiltrating
the main core of contemporary culture, burrowing in with bulletins from the
frontline, postcards from the edge, sketches of the end of the world. I'm not
sure that "Poetry in Motion" or other poems-on-buses schemes are the best way
to do this. The (beware of broad and offensive classist caricature) Oprah-
watching, Bud-drinking, jandal-wearing, league-playing, Stephen King-reading
masses may never have an interest in challenging poetry, but what about the
Seinfeld-watching, latte-drinking, Gaultier-wearing, Myst-playing, Face-reading
crowd? Rather than dismissing them as shallow yuppies, maybe we should see this
group as a potential audience, well educated and open to the contemporary in
visual arts, music and film, but generally uninterested in poetry. Perhaps with
the right "gift/hook", we could broaden the audience for contemporary poetry
without totally compromising our interest in experiment and challenge.
 
 
 
        Tom Beard.

Tom Beard--
 
Your point about Dickinson's dashes as putative records (fictive, of
course, like all other notations) of writing-as-process is surely right;
that's how we read them, against all reason.
 
It's important, though, to keep in the back of one's mind the history of
punctuation, which is one of steady rationalization. Punctuation is by now
(by the middle of the 18th century, really) almost wholly the slave of a
rationalistic, prose model of language. To punctuate correctly is to
demarcate the hypotactic structures of the sentence, distinguishing for
instance the restrictive from the nonrestrictive modifier and even the
apposition from the parenthesis. The service is to a structure of ideas,
not to a structure of sounds.
 
Those syntactical considerations do have their "prosodic" (in the
linguists' sense) correspondences--prose and verse have the same mother,
after all--but it remains very tricky to declare any one-to-one
correspondence between conventional marks of punctuation and rhythmic
characteristics of a passage of language.
 
Which means, in turn, that how a poet _chooses_ to _use_ punctuation can
be extremely interesting. I know I have poems that (as we say) demand
prose-style punctuation and those that refuse it absolutely, and a lot
that want some nonce compromise. Part of the compromise, of course, comes
about by admitting among the signs of punctuation the line-break, which
rather upsets all the other marks who thought they were in charge.

Now, Tom, as I write this I am sitting at my parents' kitchen table in

potentially damaging influence of watching reruns of Mash and Cagney and Lacy
on a 27" color TV.  But, when I read the above message, what popped into my
head was Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins, singing, "Just a spoonful of sugar
makes the medicine go down."
 
Not to change the subject, but is anyone else on this list familiar with lawn
geese, these concrete statues of geese that are like three feet high that
working class women have in their frontyards and dress in different costumes
for different seasons and holidays?  As I type this there is a lawn goose in
this very yard dressed in a pumpkin costume--there are other similarly
dressed lawn geese throughout the neighborhood.  Though my mother doesn't
have a Thanksgiving outfit for her lawn goose, she assured me that there are
pilgrims outfits available--both for both male and female pilgrim lawn geese.
 
When I was talking on the phone earlier today with Kevin (Killian) I asked
him if he thought lawn geese was a national or a regional phenomenon.  He
told me that's the kind of thing Spicer would have known.

This, from the PEN on line list, which should be of interest to this
list:
 
 
WIPC HIGHLIGHTS CAUSE OF EIGHT WRITERS SENTENCED TO DEATH
WORLDWIDE
 
15 NOVEMBER TO BE COMMEMORATED AS DAY OF THE IMPRISONED WRITER
 
Eight writers and journalists worldwide have been sentenced to
death or charged with crimes carrying the death penalty, reported
the Writers in Prison Committee (WiPC) of International PEN in
the September issue of its newsletter "Centre to Centre". PEN is
opposed to the death penalty "which it believes to be in
violation of international norms on cruelty and inhuman
punishment and in violation of the right to life." Fortunately,
since publication, one writer has received a reprieve from the
death sentence but remains in jail. Kenyan writer and former
Member of Parliament Koigi wa Wamwere was charged with robbery
with violence, which carries a mandatory death penalty. Since
publication of "Centre to Centre", the judge has reduced the
charges to armed robbery, likely due to international pressure,
and wa Wamwere was sentenced to four years in jail and six
strokes of the cane.
 
However, others have not been so lucky. United States journalist
Mumia Abu-Jamal received a stay of execution after his death
warrant was issued, but has been thus far denied the right to a
fair trial. Although Abu-Jamal maintains his innocence and it is
believed that his political beliefs were used against him, he was
convicted of killing a police officer in a trial that falls short
of international standards of fairness. The other writers the
WiPC mentions who are living under sentence of death include
Yemeni poet Mansur Rajih, who was sentenced to death in 1986 for
allegedly killing a man. Again, WiPC says the trial was seriously
flawed and critics believe he was framed for his role in the
student movement of the 1970s and early 1980s.
 
In China, WiPC reports that two publishers have already been
executed for publishing pornography. In February, Gu Jeishu was
executed after a crackdown on publishers of books said to contain
"sex, violence and superstition, as well as political mistakes."
WiPC reports that another publisher Wang Shuxiang was due to be
executed in April, although it is not known if the execution took
place. Finally, in Nigeria, writer Ken Saro-Wiwa faces the death
penalty if convicted of inciting the murder of four Ogoni
leaders. WiPC reported last week that Saro-Wiwa is to be charged
on 31 October. WiPC also protested the unfair nature of his trial
and detention, which is believed to be motivated by his political
convictions. [See UPDATES, this issue of the "Communique".]
 
The WiPC marks 15 November as the Day of the Imprisoned Writer,
reports another item in the latest issue of "Centre to Centre".
WiPC writes, "On this day and the weeks surrounding it, PEN
centres worldwide will be publicising the plight of writers who
have been killed, disappeared or imprisoned for the practice of
their right to freedom of expression." Five writers will be
profiled and PEN will update the cases of writers featured on
this day in previous years. For more information, contact WiPC at

Dodie, I think lawn ornaments are national across the US, but the
particular genres are regional. In Central Pennsylvania, for example, you
see a lot of Catholic houses with little 3' tall Virgin Marys out front,
standing in a sort of bathtub-urinal contraption. Here in Virginia, you
get those flat cardboard cutouts that represent the butt of someone
bending over to weed the garden. In both places, you see pedestals cupped
to hold huge shiny Mylar spheres, Christmas-bauble red, green, or blue.
Shit, I think I feel a poem coming on.

Maria,
 
The program at Brown has gone in the direction of the studio/arts MFA --
went that many years ago, in fact. It seems to work well for most of the
writers who spend two years here. The program is designed so that all
students take a workshop in a particular genre each of the first three
semesters in the program, and an independent study/thesis preparation
course in the fourth semester. In each of those four semesters, each
student selects one elective -- from anywhere within the university. We
have had two poets study Sanskrit, one took two years of modern dance,
many have taken video/filmmaking, papermaking, anthropology, languages,
and, of course, theory and 'traditional' literature courses. Each writer
decides what courses will best complement the act of writing. For some,
that will be a big dose of theory or philosophy. For others, it may be
Whitman and Dickinson one semester and Balinese Performance traditions
the next. One tends to hope (and believe) that regardless of the course
load selected, each writer is self-immersed into a wide-ranging selection
of additional reading -- and thinking.

The town I grew up in (in New York, down the road from Douglas Rothschild)
is covered half the year with geese. Lawn geese would have been the
equivalent of handing over the keys and showing the geese where we keep
the silver and the cigars. I did have a goose lamp for a night light,
though. Somebody told me it was a witty thing to have;  I have no idea
why.

"It was, if anything, a Printing Vortex. Books were cheap to produce in
France. On l'Ile Saint Louis William Bird's Three Mountain Press published
Hemingway, Williams, Pound: notably in 1925 A Draft of XVI Cantos, in
folio. Nancy Cunard later bought Bird's assets, and in 1930 her Hours press
issued A Draft of XXX Cantos (200 copies)" (384).
 
Spring and All: "written in New Jersey, printed in Dijon, published in
Paris, distributed--------? Not distributed, really. There were 300 copies,
Paris bookshops were not interested, American customs held up shipments for
months, American reviewers based 12 miles from Rutherford merely sneered at
expatriates when they noticed such books at all. 'Nobody ever saw
it'--Williams 35 years later-- 'it had no circulation at all'" (385).
 
"They worked in utter obscurity, as if in Paris. Williams was 'discovered'
only in 1948, when Paterson I suddenly attracted reviews; Zukofsky and
Oppen and Bunting not until the 1950's and 1960's, when reprints of work 30
years old began appearing, to answer tastes a long time forming and still
hardly articulate. The 1930's public heard of MacLeish, and Stephen Vincent
Benet, and Robert Frost (now too quickly dismissed as an Eisenhower poet);
and journalism for which Hart Crane's suicide conferred importance on The
Bridge found no way to get interested in Zukofsky's "A", whose author
jumped off no boat" (405-406).
 
"A mystique of the word--as in Miss Stein's case--is encouraged by the
circumstance that one's words will not be read.... 'Toasted Susie is my ice
cream,' wrote Miss Stein, and why not? To so fit and pack and lock and
arrange the words that when their capsules are one day broken open--perhaps
after 50 years, on an unrecognized planet--they will affirm structured
realities, like a watch that should commence ticking as though made
yesterday, that seemed the aim and morality of style" (385).

Lawn geese, no? But pelicans, jockeys (that one's racist), and other lawn
ornaments. I think that the geese may be regional, but that lawn ornaments
(and not limited to working class women) are universal. My favorite were in
various barrios in Tucson where occasionally one could see refrigerators
without doors in lawns, sometimes cut off so as not to be so tall, forming a
kind of grotto, lit or unlit, filled with Virgin of Guadalupe, personal
mementos, wishes for the ill or deceased -- small personal shrines made public.

Dodie & Gwyn,
Here in Somerville MA we have the bathtub Marys, and Jesuses too,
all over the place. One house around the corner from me has on its front
a big ceramic-tile mural of Jesus, which has the unfortunate effect of
looking like an exposed shower stall. What's with this religious bathroom
fixtures theme? Next we'll have Buddha sitting on a toilet and Kali
wielding curling irons.  I haven't seen the flat butt people though I've
passed some yards with little plastic animals in the gardens.

Loss:  As Marvin Gaye knew so well, distance loving is valued, but ain't
nothing like the real thing --
 
When I was a grad. student, I worked in continuing education arranging
ITFS broadcasts of university courses, both credit & non-credit, for
students in groups at their places of work.  As a faculty member, I have
several times taught classes that were relayed by live video to branch
campus sites in other parts of the state.
 
The teaching itself went just fine.  The students in the "main" classroom
were greatly frustrated by their inability to see their colleagues at the
off-campus sites, but we did have live voice hook-up, and the off-campus
folks felt free to join the discussions.  (In fact, they often continued
discussion in their own groups after the class.) Particularly important
was the fact that we had live technicians in the booth working the
cameras so that students didn't sit in front of a static shot for an hour
& a half.
 
But, the possibilities of Distance Learning, like those of the web
itself, are at present being vastly overestimated by people who hope to
profit from the technology, and by campus administrators.  The fact is
that faculty fears of being replaced by video are not just untenured
paranoia.  I've just written a speech for a humanities conference at UC
Irvine in which I talk about the continued privatizing of the humanites
and of the human.  To use California as an example -- The state
government, _and the university administration_, continue to point to
recession and dwindling resources as necessitating the deep cuts to the
higher education budget.  Meanwhile, the prison budget swells (more money
in that budget than in higher ed. this year for the first time ever), and
administrative positions (which had grown by 61% in less than two
decades) have not diminished significantly.
 
Instead of carrying the political fight for higher education to the
public, most university administrators are turning to increased use of
private fund-raising and management solutions to lack of dollars for
instruction.  Thus, we are being pressured to increase yet further our
reliance on part-time instruction, and anything that can teach students
with fewer faculty is embraced by management.
 
Distance learning is being ballyhooed as the answer to any number of real
problems, but the danger is that it will substitute for hiring qualified
new faculty.  I've always believed that part-time instruction should only
be used to deal with minor and unexpected fluctuations in enrollment, or
to make use of _exceptional_ abilities offered by instructors who choose
not to teach full-time.  In the same way, distance learning should, in my
opinion, be used only to reach students who could not otherwise be
reached (like those in, what else, distant regions) or to bring
_exceptional_ opportunities to wider audiences (like a visiting scholar
who can't possibly teach as many students as wish to study with that
person).  Distance learning should never be employed as a means to avoid
employing a qualified instructor.  If there are enough students to take
the course, there should be a willingness to staff it properly.  There is
no justifiable reason to use distance learning to teach regular courses
in the catalogue to people who would otherwise study with a live instructor.
 
Some deans and presidents have been willing to agree in writing to such
principles.  Others are laying people off and buying hardware.  Most
universities I've visited are wobbling in between these positions with no
real agreement on principles.
 
Telegenically yours,
 
aldon  (and congrats. on the book!  If you tape the reading, I'd like to
hear it.)

I'm not sure if this is significant, but there has been a recent spate of

Maria: I kind of agree kind of totally. I know what you describe was true,
at least, in my case. Can't speak for others. For me, oddly, theory
courses were a refuge fromthe kind of half-baked pseudo-hipness of
the workshop mentality here in BR, ie, the cult of the funky Southern
writer. After listening to other posts, however, I am beginning to
seriously wonder how common my experience was.
     I think the best bet may be (as someone else requested: unfortunately
I have moved too quickly through the posts to remember who specifically)
to require poets to develop other interests, IE, theory, art history,
information, dance, sculpture, whatever the hell, just not to be so
narrow.
     Thanks, Eric.

Subject:      Albert Hall
 
     Thanks to Ken for a breezy and basically accurate out front response.
Here's a rambling take from the backstage viewpoint during which I'll try
to talk as much about performance qualities as possible, in the hope that
it's of interest.
 
     Originally planned to offer a solo version (for 3 voices  -  holding
hand-sized self-powered speakers with two other tracks of my own voice
recorded and mixed in split stereo) of some work I've been engaged with
called 'fogs'. Decided about five days before the event that since so many
people were going to be standing pretty still and reading then perhaps
bringing a more performance attitude to the event could help the overall
dynamic  -  pretty sure I'd been booked on that basis after finally seeing
the publicity announcing 'poetry and performance'. Must admit that a key
element in this decision (although there was a cop out side to it as well)
was the relative imbalance of women on the bill (to say nothing of Ken's
noted token black poet). Sianed and I had just done a three and one half
minute piece for Anglia tv and decided simply to extend that item. So,
instead of taking a briefcase I loaded the car with Harmonium, Violin,
Clarinet, Pine tree and so on  -  not exactly the 'normal' poetry reading
accoutrements  -  picked up Sianed from the electronic music studios on the
University of East Anglia campus (where she's taking an MA) and drove to
London.
 
     Arrived Albert Hall just before 4 in the afternoon, so as to spend
some time sorting out our slightly more complicated sound.  The 'natural'
acoustic is extremely 'live'. We can fill the hall even without any P.A.
 
Unloaded straight onto the stage where Brian Catling was trying out his
'Cyclops' mirror to the lips (what certainly resembles a talking arsehole)
routine. There's an atmosphere of curious calm  -  almost but in the event
not quite, before storm  -  suspension of disbelief.
 
     Mike Goldmark, the bookseller and promoter of this event, strolls over
in barefeet and (for a man who's hired this hall out for =A320,000 and is
about to go bankrupt, or so he says) exudes wonder at what's going on
around him and how well it's all coming together.
 
     Technically the hall is almost already set, with a giant screen
hanging above the stage. The sound is thankfully excellent - top quality
monitors and radio mikes for all. Gradually poets begin to assemble on the
stage and a possee of photographers buzz around us. I swear there must have
been shutters going off every couple of seconds for much of the time  -
and then there are others filming from the stalls, from the stage. The last
time I'd been here I'd seen Jimi Hendrix burning his guitar before I even
hit my teens.
 
     Much of the next three hours is a coming and going (definitely poetry
rather than rock 'n' roll) gathering with most people just sitting around
on the stage and chatting, in between brief sound checks. Paul McCartney
arrives and does his, simply grinning and saying hello (although I can't
help feeling that Ginsberg picked the wrong Beatle, Ringo would have been
much more 'challenging' as an accompanist).
 
     I came into the hall at one point to find a shocked camera crew
witnessing Aaron almost riveting the Albert Hall to its foundations with
his vocal tests. "It takes a long time for each sound to fade" he said.
Pretty remarkable, and 'profoundly deaf' in deed (to be fair to Ken that's
how many have introudced him).
 
     Now there's a de rigeur mutual signing of programmes taking effect
which keeps most of the poets busy and introductory until the off. My most
enjoyable exchange was with Brendan Kennally as we became almost hysterical
over the book title 'Tough' (both for reader and writer) and took bets on
which of the two of us would first write it. Other conversations  -  with
Ginsberg about photography and his diet (not that either of us suggested
that the two were related) and his surprise at how well (in broad
comparison to his poetry) his photographic exhibitions had been received in
the US press  -  with Zephaniah about the anonymity as distinct from the
occasional celebrity status of the 'other' with particular reference to
internment of Iraqi people in Britain during the Gulf War  -  with Sorley
MacLean about his love of Norwich  -  with Bill Sherman (likewise my great
surprise at seeing him) about the recent spur to Independent movements
given by French Nuclear testing in Tahiti (he spends a lot of time there
these days)  -  you know, it was very friendly and rangey and consequently
pleasant.
 
     Michael Moorcock is sitting in a dressing room trying to read Denise
Riley's 'Mop Mop Georgette' while I'm testing a light I picked up that
morning which I had designed so as to react to the attack and decay on my
voice (even down to the breath  -  I though you might have spotted that
Ken) and shade it in my customary layerings of red lettuce and spinach
(guess that's what looked liked xmas effect from a distance). He seems
almost drunk and distant, affable but buffoonish.
 
     There's a green room full of cheeses and breads and fruits.
 
     Finally the atmosphere gets more down to business as the evening
begins to show.My experience of the first half was from backstage. There
was a tannoy relay of onstage sound and a black and white feed from cameras
in the hall onto a monitor close by the stage door. There are two broadly
identifiable poets present now backstage  -  the jovial and the
introspective.
 
     Suddenly, or so it seems after a slightly late start, Brian Catling is
on. He used to stutter frequently in readings but he's worked hard at that
and lost his stutter completely in this kind of work. I'm wondering how
he'll go down, I enjoy his work immensely myself, and am delighted to hear
loud applause and cheering as he leaves the stage with a customary grin
across his now asymetrical face (you won't understand that unless you
reflect back on the mirror he's been holding up). The fact that so many in
the audience are obviously determined to enjoy themselves and root for the
performers is encouraging to say the least. Couldn't see his film well from
backstage and I'm looking forward to seeing the video of the event in
another thirty years time (the original Wholly Communion has just been
released on video btw).
 
     Sianed and I relax as Aaron launches out into some of the most
intricate and compelling vocalising of language one could desire. He
literally explores every crevice in each word, every fault-line of each
phrase. The texture of his speaking is for me exemplary. He compels the
silence to shatter itself  -  his closely navigated breath fully
acknowledges the architextural space into which it is sounded and he
positively brings language directed back into his body. His is an
integrated gesture. In comparison Artaud's recording of 'To Have Done With
The Judgement Of God' sounds unconvincing. As he finished, what sounds
backstage like a massive cheer fills the hall and harsh applause rains into
the dressing rooms through tiny wall-mounted speakers as I go through a
simple centering and balancing (adapted from something Steve Paxton taught
me) warm-up routine.
 
     It 'sounds' like a big audience, but that's only based on applause.
 
     Moorcock's on but I can't hear him properly. Aidan Dun's guitar
tinkles away and momentarily I think of Ali Farka Toure, then Donovan as
his voice comes in (he was most distant of the performers for me, gets
reviewed as Rimbaud like, or some such, in The Independent newspaper  -
what's Rimbaud like mean?) and then I can make out Denise Riley, sounding
strong for all her terrifying nerves. You pick someone close to the front
and just read to them intimately, as if they were the only person there, if
the fear grips you too tightly. Sinclair (yes he did have a strong hand in
the programming) next. I watch him standing close to the front of the stage
as we wait in the bull run, ready to rush on and set up our gear in the
interlude provided by film of David Gasgoigne.
 
     In the dark we set up a table for the harmonium, two mike stands, a
hand-held light, a string of electronic effects. I take off into the
audience, walking down the centre aisle to the back of the hall, surprised
to see just how thin the audience feels closest to the stage (in the
expensive seats presumably), looking around and thinking somewhere between
1-2000 people. Great, as Ken says, for a poetry gig, but less than it
sounded backstage. Gasgoigne's film lasts just long enough for composure.
 
     I'm standing in the hall feeling kind of invisible. It's that moment
when adrenalin is closing on the surface. It's a complex moment of
narrowing focus and softening, opening awareness. Trying to gather energy
and relax, to erupt and be still. The lights go up on an empty stage. The
first thought I have is that something has gone wrong and Sianed is rushing
around backstage having a technical nightmare, but then she appears, calmly
picking up her violin and bow (I'm being deliberately over the top in this
description). This is what I wanted to happen  -  a woman playing the
violin, going through huge distortion pedals, chorusing and reverbs fills
the Albert Hall (scene of Proms and romantic string gush a go-go ever since
Albert had his Prince Albert job) with wildly textured noise (dodging and
burning classical references in a brief homage to Hendrix). Masking Ivo
Papasov having a jam with Giorgos Mangas in the minuret of an east end
Mosque I call back on clarinet, moving down the centre aisle and spinning
the harshest reedy sound I can tongue in circles over the heads of those
immediately nearest to me and out into the dome. (I always worry about
bashing someone on the head inadvertently in that first adrenal rush).
Rushing themselves (this is self-critical in some ways too, it's a going
out and over the top sensation, launching from trenches with oneself as an
enemy) to meet the scale of the event, the audience (unexpectantly for us
and somewhat disconcertingly) bursts into a spate of applause as there's an
awkward break while Sianed switches to harmonium and sings a brief phrase
modelled on Mongolian long song with lyrics in part-invented language
embodied from her native Welsh. (a lot of people took this for Bulgarian
vocal styling, in fact it's considerably different  -  a singing of the
vast landscapes on the edge of the Gobi desert  -  although using the hard
edged throat voice more widely familiar from recordings and concerts by
Trio Bulgarka or Les Mystere des Voix Bulgares). I burble along on a large
turtle ocarina being picked up by the voice clip mike. A quiet and
reflective time to gather again and take stock. How many people here have
had that experience of watching themselves during a performance? - of
settling into a moment (almost slow motion) and pushing on. We segue into
simple rhythmical phrases of breath  -  hand-pumped harmonium and voice.
It's time to try out my new voice-activated light. Only collected it this
morning and wonder how subtle I can get with it on the first time out. The
light is attached to a circuit activated by a microphone that picks up the
attack and decay on my voice and triggers the bulb. I've been working with
hand-held lights in performance for a couple of years now but this a new
development. I like the intimacy it brings to the space immediately around
the body and how this relates to the space of the breath and heat and
energy immediate to every body. So the language I use hovers around breath
and pulse and blood and sound and light in a brief and humouress
improvisation centred around energy trapped between the living and the
dead. It went close to something like this and was accompanied by rising
and falling harmonium with the air sometimes fading so that notes dropped
out of hearing (like Bach's 'Art of Fugue' last gasps) and the light
responded on and off as I spoke  /  well there's an element of Shakespeare
gone horribly wrong declamation in this monologue at times as well:
 
'To who comes (brief whistled snatch of the old vaudeville song 'whistling
in the dark') whistling in the dark

ate into the spinach and lettuce around the buld)

Well what do you expect me to say? For in this shady passage throughout
life  -  during which the future is and remain radically unknowable  -
 
death is the only certainty
 
I wrote a poem about it somewhere (then drawing a handful of torn paper
scraps from the breast pocket of my jacket and scattering them onto the
floor)

After all, and after all that

     Then we segued out with a 45 second tape of scattered voices, mbira
and jaws harp on the hand-held speakers I mentioned earlier whilst adding
to the part singing part scat deconstructions, turning the speakers back
into my body whilst Sianed was now holding the light on the pine-tree pole.
=46inish, warm applause  -  enjoyed this moment and get off, grabbing our
gear as we go. We both enjoyed it. Felt settled through it.
 
     So what was it all about Ken? I'm not convinced that's the most useful
question. But perhaps that extensive discursion 'helps'. My and Sianed's
interest in performance more and more focusses onto the pace and texture
and trajectories of events through time and states of energy rhyming within
that process. The work is always language / breath / voice / body based.
I'm often keen to engage with the paradoxical and critical image of the
performer as trapped by the audience and vice versa  -  the presentation of
the problem of spectacle. 8 minutes in a shared context on such a scale
with little set up in a poetry event which is overloaded with poetry?
Answers to a seperate subject heading of 8 minutes please. My alternative
might have been to simply breath and let the light work on me  -  only
that. Next piece will probably become the concert for breath I've wanted to
try for a while now.
 
     We left a small pool of paper fragments from within which most of the
poets read during the rest of the evening. I like those fragile physical
residues too.
 
     Bill Sherman followed us on and then Horowitz took us through to the
interval but I missed him. Spent most of the interval signing 26 programmes
and talking to Zephaniah about the GLC and Hand Wangford's Lost Cowboys
(this is very in-British stuff so I'll shift straight to the second half).
 
     Several of us watched the whole of the second half from a box directly
opposite the stage at the back of the hall. Perhaps I've haven't got a
great deal to add to Ken's account excepting a different taste. I liked
Doug Oliver's 'Oracle of the Drowned' and was curious to hear his 'african'
material, although he seemed distant (even prurient) rather than engaged
with it to anything other than intellectual intensity. More body please
Doug.
 
     Alice's voice interested me in so much as it seemed a good example of
a register which seems to me to have a period stamped on it that is not of
today.
 
     Kennelly was tremendous and I even fell for the craft of his little
girl poem that Ken got slimed by. Sorley didn't read his best stuff  -
which for me is the wind and waves whistling gaelic sea and mountain
pieces. Anne Waldman was terrific, simply very much stronger each time I
get the chance to hear her. I missed Kathy Acker's presence though.
 
     Ginsberg had the best rider (herbal trea and flowers) -  poets might
think more about riders. Catling had a great one with the British Council
-  when they asked him to perform in Israel for little money he demanded
the opportunites to snorkel in the Red Sea and fire an Uzi, he got both.
 
     There were several serious acid casualties backstage afterwards  -
"hey man, ahve you read Robert Anton Wilson?". Paul McCartney and Linda
McCartney both shook Sianed's hand and said how much they'd enjoyed our
contribution (must have been while I was standing by the entrance handing
out leaflets for an upcoming Slant gig), she forgot to ask for a free
consignment of latex pies. I'll never forget the muppet-like image of
Ginsberg waggling his finger at McCartney and roaring "one more time" as
the latter struggled to find another variation on the I fought the Law and
the Law Won style riff he was wagering. And Ginsberg's seventeen syllable
poems had a strange double image. Was he that young boy lying in his room
or is he really still banging on the young's drum "one more time"?
 
     This is the morning after the morning after and I come downstairs to
'Wild Thing' ('but I wanna know-oh for sure') followed by the strap line
'the scent of freedom' playing out on breakfast tv. Apparently Sianed and I
went out in some form or other on breakfast tv yesterday but I didn't see
it having been at Filthy McNasties (a packed Islington sawdust and salad
wag's dive) for lock-in style late night candle-lit drinking bout during
which I talked to Anne Waldman about the School fur Dichtung in Vienna, saw
Ginsberg undo the top button of his royal blue shirt and witnessed Shane
McGowan (ex Pogues epic pisshead) slumping onto a wet bar with his
sideburns mopping up what the slop cloth fails to catch. Somewhere in there
(I wasn't drunk myself  -  had to drive home 125 miles at three in the
morning then go straight into college for 9.30 - in Norwich itself 45
minutes drive away - the following morning) I caught up with comedian
Arthur Smith whose brilliant 40 minute deconstructed, prozac-driven
'Hamlet' I'd enjoyed in Edinburgh and together we reprised its apopleptic
song :
 
"I've seen your arse
Your Dirty great arse
I've seen your arse
In the water".  It was that kind of night. Hilarious and mostly askew.

James,
      as to who I think they're all Brit. Cricketers and there's a big
indoor game coming up at the Albert Stadium in London I think.
      do you reckon  value judgements are a subtefuge? I've heard people
on this list claim that regarding poems. at least they are a handy
shorthand. yesterday in a staff meeting discussing a proposal for a
freshman paper in popular fiction, someone attacked it because the texts
were second rate, which did seem to be an acceptable view to the
proposers although they were annoyed, but when I said the texts were
uncool, it was taken as a personal attack by the proponents. Colleagues
were divided as to whether I had gone too far. I'm still figuring out
what it was all about, any ideas?

Dear tom (and dodie)
           well I don't see why garden ornaments and the question of the
changing history of the audience(s) for the high arts can't be a single
subject of discussion. There's an outfit in Auckland which goes around
at night covering lawns with lifesize plastic flamingoes. You pay them a
fee,or rental; finger a loved one with a birthday, anniversary,
hangover, or suicidal depression and they will deliver the nasty shock.
          and those people you describe, tom, they with the interests in
music, film, etc who could be interested in poetry, aren't they
precisely the people who packed out the Hejinian, Creeley and various
groupings of local readers at Alba this year. the audience exists.
          much of the discussion of audience on this list seems unduly
dependent upon questions of book sales, distribution points, numbers of
readers, grants and so on. The equally, but for the purposes of my
point, more interesting issue is what happens next. who is reading,
buying, listening and what are they doing with what they get. The small
sales of book X going to a certain kind of 100 readers may well be
vastly more consequential as far as the circulation of meanings goes and
the large sales of book Y to a certain kind of 100,000 readers. I'd say.
When poetry was a lot more popular and successful book X and book Y
were often the same book. And, in Browning's case, a railroad timetable
to boot. Pretty famingo

Distance learning is most cost effective.  The classroom can be as big
as you want.  No limits.  One prof (or a video player or any one or
group of other machines) can reach an unlimited number of students.  So
there are and will be more problems.  But then there really are those
who just can't get to a campus.  That's why some of the leaders in DL are
extension centers in places like Utah, Wyoming, Australia...  The
wide-flung classroom.  If you want students with truly differing
perspectives, there you are.  And then, in our own way, we're doing DL
right here.  I'm in Taiwan (not Taipei) learning lots by reading the
postings to this list.  Of course I'm not getting degree credit.  Anyway,
it's the push for FTEs that worries me.  DL builds them oh so quickly.

Hope I haven't taken the above too much out of context, Eric.  Don't mean to.
Anyway, I'm not sure I can agree that "the people" have never had
poetry.  As yoiu suggest, inevitably, this discussion must deal with
definition, but I don't think I can restrict my definition of poetry enough
to agree with your point, especially the idea of poetry being and always
having been "a highly elite activity."  My definition would insist on
including whatever poetry has been widely read in its own time.  But then
even if we aren't that liberal in what we admit as poetry, I believe the
people have had poetry.  By the way, by "people" I really just mean those
who haven't more than the average formal education in whatever society,
culture they're a part of.
 
Probably, the question for me isn't so much whether poetry has been taken
away from the people (not my phrase--sorry I can't remember what article I
got it from) but whether parts of it have.  More so, I wonder what
it may be in Western culture that has rendered the poetry we tend to
speak of here on this list so peripheral.  (That's to ask, in a
sense, how that kind of poetry came to be in the first place.)
There are societies, cultures in which very serious "high" poetry is
not nearly so peripheral to its society or not peripheral at all.
My own experience reminds me of Yemeni poetry, still very much part
of an oral tradition, composed (not written) by persons who neither
write nor read but still very sophisticated.  Some Yemeni poets, by
the way, believe that writing down a poem kills it.  To be true
poetry, it must be alive, changing with each re-recitation.
 
I'm going on too long, so let me finish by posing another question:  Does
our fixation with writing everything down, publishing it, studying it,
writing about it, getting degrees in it, etc., etc.  have anything to do
with where poetry is right now in our culture?  If culture is at all a
form of capital, as suggested by Pierre Bourdieu in _Les Regles de l'art:
Genese at structure du champ litteraire_ and earlier works, perhaps it
does, especially if poetry has become a capital used to gain and hold
social and economic power as he also suggests.

Chris--
 
well right it's odd to just flat out call her "avant-garde" or something.
But isn't she, say, a RESOURCE for a contrmporary writer (even a writer on
this list) in a way that, say, Longfellow or Tuckermann or Sandberg or let's
say Merwin  etc. isn't?  Just as, say, the insane ballads of Auden can
energize contemporary experimental writing (Ashbery's for example)?  And
back to the WCW strain: does he energize no exciting experimental work (and
are we bored w O'Hara now too)?

what I wanted to hear, anyway, was more from Ron about how the ambivalence
shows up, specifically, in the poetry (Michael's): something about the
pressure doing criticism, or yammering to others about Great Poetry for a
living, puts on writing poetry; esp since, having read a bunch of Michael's
poetry (though not all) it wasn't immediately apparent to me how this might
play out.

When I was a student, 25 years ago, theory played a valuable role in
part precisely because it was so utterly Other. It spoke to the
activity to my work but seemed all but completely outside the bounds of
what was then permissable. At SF State, nobody at all seemed to have
heard to Barthes. At Berkeley, just the grad students and junior
faculty showed an interest. There was a freedom in that that was, I
think, an integral part of the experience itself. Today, now that
theory has been so routinized and professionalized within English
departments, I suspect that it has to have a very different value and
meaning for the students there. So while the level of knowledge and
sophistication that one finds in, say, a Steve Evans or a Mark Wallace
was not even possible circa 1970, what sets them apart today is not
that they know the theory, but rather that they have figured out how to
use it creatively. Andrew Ross was literally the first human being I
ever met who could do that and it remains a rare experience.
 
Just to note that these "values" are not static, but as thoroughly
contextualized as anything.

Even though I'm clearly not against reading theory, from my experience in
teaching prose writing workshops I have my doubts about the reading theory
having much of a direct connection to students' adverturousness in writing.
 I've found theory ultimately helpful to me--but as a beginning writer I
found blind imitation of things I found "neat" to be the most useful.  I did
have the priviledged position of living in the incredibly sophisticated
writing world of San Francisco, and of learning about experimental writing by
being thrown in the middle of a scene I didn't really grasp.  It was like
going to a foreign country and picking up its language in order to survive
vs. studying that language in a classroom.  I've had students who were very
sophisticated in theory--and who didn't have a clue as to how to apply it to
their writing--and who felt very frustrated as a result of this.  And then
you get the other end of the spectrum, where the writing become some sort of
petrie dish for the theory, and the writing is dead--though "moldy" might be
a more appropriate term to extend my metaphor.  I think that theory has a
place in the teaching of writing, but the main focus should be rolling up
your shirtsleeves and mucking around in the writing itself.

Burt,
 
Perhaps the kind of thing we're doing here could somehow be used in an
enlightened approach to dl.  One of my main reservations concerning dl,
as I have observed it, has been the tendency among instructors to "can"
lectures and more-or-less read them over the air.  I suppose this comes
from a sense of not really being able to communicate with those distant
students.  It can be quite unsettling to feel that you'll never really
meet someone you're supposed to be teaching, so much so that retreating
behind a text, a book or a lecture, can be too tempting.

Subject:      distanced learning...
 
well let me relate a little story about distance learning, something that
went down this semester here at illinois institute of technology... by way
of trying to suggest how such technology is generally being conceived
during these dire economic times by educational admin. types... and please
note that i've always been a proponent of using technologies to help, even
reform teaching wherever possible... that surely dl has a role in reaching
hard-to-reach locations... but that it's entirely problematic, methinks, as
currently construed/utilized... because when it comes to teaching, there's
a  difference twixt, say, *this* technology---email---and projected images,
even with little voice-feedback boxes... that in fact one of the reasons
linking classrooms through email dialogue hasn't caught on as rapidly is
precisely BECAUSE one needs must alter one's pedagogical stance to
accommodate same, interactively speaking... whereas the projection of
instructor images through spacetime is bound to be centered on the
instructor (what would happen, for example, if the camera attempted to
accommodate the other twenty faces in each room?...and how could this be
done, finally, in something like real time?... and what would this mean
anyway, learning-wise?)...
 
i teach in the dept. of humanities here... and we have a satellite campus
out in the burbs, a solid thirty mile/forty-five minute hike through
traffic due west... and we use part-time adjunct faculty at this latter to
teach various humanities courses...
 
this semester, last minute, one of our adjuncts cancelled for personal
reasons... and the first suggestion---the very first---was to use the
celebrated iitv system to 'cover' that course... and yours truly was asked
to do so...
 
no thought given to how i teach---i happen to be a proponent of
student-centered pedagogies, for example, i happen to believe in many of
the tenets of so-called liberatory theories of teaching... in fact, i was
informed by the colleague who approached me with this 'solution' that "it's
my understanding that we can do everything in an iitv room that we can do
in a regular classroom"...  just like that, not even the remotest [wink]
sign of anxiety regarding such an assertion... no thought given to WHO i
was teaching---on the main campus it's mostly undergrads., out in the burbs
it's mostly older, returning, part-time students, and this represents a
dichotomy of intention, if you will, right from the start...
 
in short, no thought given... hence i mself refused even to think when i
responded to this veiled "command," to wit, NO---I WON'T DO IT, I DON'T
TEACH THAT WAY...
 
didn't go over too well with some folks, needless to say... and i ended up
being "tasked," as bureaucrazies like to say, with phoning each of the
eight students in the burbs to try to cajole them into coming to the main
campus... which not one would...  it's a long drive, you understand, and
they don't like chicago's south side, ETC.---and yes, there are ALL sorts
of issues entailed in this, including suburban fear of urban realities (a
racially based fear in so many ways, regardless how seemingly
justifiable)...
 
anyway, i needn't go on here, methinks... the point is that on my campus, a
technical campus in the midst of complete restructuring and downsizing---a
situation where the first thing to go out the window is a discussion of
*learning*---the solution to educators' woes is DISTANCED LEARNING... i
passed by a rather large iitv room just the other day, in fact, with the
cameras on and TWO STUDENTS watching the solitary instructor go through his
little canned routine on (i think it was) statics and dynamics, drawing his
little free body diagrams on the board and carefully positioning his body
vis-a-vis the camera as he did so, smiling and inflecting with the utmost
precision, addressing himself to the two students present as well as to his
anonymous viewing classroom 'community,' a fitting image as the lights go
out on late 20th. century 'liberal education,' all for the sake of what our
iit admins. call "the bottom line"...
 
or was it just a dream?...
 
anyway, you get two
two
two mints
in one...

Dodie -- Do you know of the garden trolls of Britain?  I don't know how
far back the custom goes, but I've seen some English gardens that have
little room left for vegetation among all the trolls etc.
 
& Others --
Our English department recently dropped all course requirements (except
for the intro. on how to look stuff up & document it), BUT added a
requirement that all students, including creative writing students, take
the same MA exam.  But this is because we don't have an MFA (there's a
statewide moratorium on new programs) -- Because our MA students all get
the same degree, they can go out and apply for the same jobs in the
community colleges, high schools, and so forth.  That being the case, we
thought it a good idea to make sure they knew something about the
subject, beyond their own writing, before loosing them on students elsewhere.

yes bart,
 
the "canning" of lectures for distance learning--but this may be a temporary
state of affairs, MAYBE, caused by all the difficulties attendent on using
new technologies. i'm told that, for example, teaching in a "virtual
classroom" (real time) medium is so fraught with deadly detailing and
coordination that instructors may have only their canned lecture as
a stable element in the mix.  as for video taping etc.--as you have said,
there are plenty of folks who benefit from dl because of their locations
and time frames; popping a tape into the vcr to see/hear the lecture when
it's convenient, being able to stop and rewind it to check something
closely, and so on, can be a great advantage. as for communities,
there are all kinds, some electronic (carbon based, as bill gates might
say)
 
[correction (i can't edit lines above this): (silicon based, as bill
gates might say),
 
and other communities that are carbon based (as opposed to silicon based).

Since I'm spending six weeks in Milwaukee, last Friday I went to Black Hawk
Island with Wisconin's Number One Lorine Niedecker Fan.  I saw Lorine's
humble cottage where she wrote.  When I looked in the window of this shrine,
the first thing I saw was an exercise bicycle.  I guess the people who bought
the land are using it as a storage shed.  But there still is a historical
landmark sign next to it.  And the river is incredible.  I also visited
Lorine's grave--lovely pink fake roses beside it.  And I visited her archives
at the local library.  When I signed the guest register it was nice to see
Jeff Hansen and Elizabeth Burns' names from years ago.
 
Lorine's Number One fan told me lots of stories about her.  He'd even had a
drink with the man who dug her grave.  He told me that the reason Zukowski
didn't marry her was because she wasn't Jewish.  So, I was surprised to see
her name on the listserve notice of Jewish writers to be written about.
 Could the Wisconsin's Number One Niedecker Fan be wrong?  I asked someone
else on the list about this issue and he wrote to me:
 
"Now, I don't know about Niedecker.  I thought the reason Z rejected LN is
that he had found another, wealthier woman called Celia.  It was kind of
like A Place in the Sun-he rejected the poor, pregnant LN because Celia had
money.   (At least he didn't take LN to the middle of a lake and drown her
like Montgomery Clift does to Shelley Winters in the movie.)  But maybe
her fan is right, and this American Jewish Writers guy is wrong."
 
Does anybody have any info on the Niedecker/Zukowski thing?

Subject:      review of Brakhage films at MOMA
 
Stan Brakhage's _Trilogy_ (_We Hold These_; _I Take These Truths_; and _I..._)
at the Museum of Modern Art Friday October 13:
 
In a packed auditorium, people watched splotches of color on a screen.
There was no plot to the color. The depth of space in the films was fantastic.
Whole worlds of layer on top of layer were created. During the break,
 the film maker explained that the color was produced by magic marker.
 
The films were between 12 minutes and 35 minutes long yet
with each film the sense of time disappeared. It was hard to tell how long
or short
a particular film was. In fact they all seemed to be about the same length
upon reflection
after the event (although the program, of course, confirmed otherwise). I
can't figure out
if reflection is sped up or slowed down or recognized to just be the speed
of film in these works.
 
Is pleasure here in the color's fast movement and hypnotic potential or in
something else altogether different?
 
During the films the audience was very quiet except for several coughing and
fidgeting children.
I kept thinking of corruption and wondering who would bring their children
to such pornography
of image and setting. Later it was obvious that the children were the film
maker's and were used
to such imagery. While the children ran around on the stage in front of the
crowd, the film maker
spoke of his films as children's art, as self-evident. This bothered me a
little because I think the child
argument is sometimes used to trivialize things that look un-polished.
 
A declaration of independence, an American tradition of self-reliance also
filled the film maker's rhetoric.
Also an idea of community seemed to be behind the films; of "we hold."
 
Is it hubris or just right to name a film I... and have only colors and shapes?
 
As I watched the abstract splotches of color pass, I kept seeing feet in the
images.
I knew the feet were not really there (as in drawn by the film maker). This
kept annoying me at first
and I felt like my mind was purposely domesticating the splotches of color
so as to save itself the work
of negotiating abstraction. Do I have to put the self into everything, I
kept asking myself. Later I just
let the feet come.
 
The films were a reminder of how much I appreciated the language of
abstraction over the language of
narrative-demand. They also suddenly made clear to me the reason that I have
had so much trouble
appreciated abstract art over other forms of abstraction: it doesn't move
and thus has trouble illustrating process to me.

It seems as though a ground-swell has begun to build, suggesting a
collective desire for a "look-see" at the materials related to distance
learning. If the materials are in a structure by which it would not be
an inconvenience to place them into an electronic envelope, perhaps A.L.
would consider sending one such electronic envelope to the list server that

Dodie,
 
This is a valid criticism, and the notion of "gift" or "hook" that prompted
some discussion a while ago is a problematic one. What I'm really aiming at is
some kind of invitation, some quality that, after a first reading, invites a
reader back into the work. When you read through a little magazine, what is it
about certain pieces that make you want to come back to them? This will be
different for every reader, of course, and radically different for someone who
writes experimental poetry compared to someone who rarely reads poetry.
 
Part of my reason for bringing up this subject is personal: I enjoy poetry, and
wish that more of my friends did so too. Occasionally there is a connection - I
had a couple of flatmates, a physicist and an accountant, who really flipped
when I introduced them to Edwin Morgan's "The First Men on Mercury" and "The
Computer's First Christmas Card" - but these moments are all too rare. I'm
beginning to wonder how much I really _enjoy_ reading poetry myself - most of
what's published in _Sport_ (NZ's leading literary journal) these days is too
bland to grab my attention, and although I'm intrigued by the theory of
language poetry, I find most of it uninviting.
 
As for "a spoonful of sugar" ... well, I _like_ sugar :-). But not to the point
of blandness. I want something complex and succulent, heady and intense, like a
good botrytised Riesling after 10 years in the bottle, rather than something
austere and tannic, like a young Cabernet from a cold year. Maybe this _is_
Mary-Poppins-ish, but my interest in linguistically innovative writing doesn't
override my response to some vague X-factor (the lyrical? the evocative (of
what? for whom?) the magical?) that sends a frisson down my back and leaves me
dangling on the poet's hook.

Wystan,
 
Yes, I was initially encouraged by the turnout at the Creeley reading. But when
I talked to some of the people there, they said, "Oh, I've never read any of
his poems before, but my lecturer said we should come along". It's great to see
that these sorts of readings are introducing people to contemporary poetry, but
they still don't seem to be reaching far beyond the academy. I missed Lyn
Hejinian's reading because I didn't hear about it - it didn't seem to have been
advertised anywhere apart from in the cafe window, and again, perhaps, within
the university.
 
Similarly, it was wonderful to see _Pavement_ (a local fashion/music/arts/
lifestyle mag) do an interview with Robert Creeley, but disappointing to see
them playing up the "friend of the Beats" angle. The interviewer showed little
signs of actually having _read_ any of Creeley's poetry, and most of the
questions were along the lines of "So, tell me about Allen Ginsberg".

Very true - it could be said that one attentive, active reader is worth 10 (or
even 1000?) passive reader. As I said in my previous post, my main concern is
not so much for the _writers_ missing out on a potential audience, but for the
_readers_ missing out on the chance to read challenging but rewarding poetry. I
don't see any chance of having 100,000 attentive readers of poetry in a country
of 3.5 million, but maybe a couple of thousand is possible, and an improvement
on 100.
 
As I've said before (I think), I like the idea of readers taking an active part
in the making of a poem. One way to do this is to cut down your readership
until there's no-one but other poets and critics left. A more challenging, and,
I think, rewarding option is to "entice" readers into your work and have them
participate in finding meanings. This way, you have helped a group of people
_who would not otherwise do so_ to explore with you the possibilities,
ambiguities and limits of language.

Well Aldon there aren't many outright trolls that I'm aware of in the

it carefully unless you wake thy neighbours) Walt Disney  -  called garden
gnomes. For those without knowledge of such riveting political minutiae it
is a fact, celebrated by the self-same, that John Major's father
manufactured garden gnomes (after his circus career stalled). In fact Major
uses this as an example of his honest hard-working roots. There are gnomes
for almost all human pastime equivalents. Many of them wheel little barrows
or dig the clod (a little like the god Pan talking that goes on at Findhorn
here and at other 'new age' eco centres stateside I should guess). Many
gnomes hold fishing rods and sit by ornamental ponds. A curious realisation
of the romantic tendency  -  a locus(t) where Ian Hamilton Finlay and the
garden ornament tradition meet anthropomorphical 'fairies at the Bottom of
our Garden' extropian Arthur Conan rabbit brio.

Aldon's phrase "study with" is the one that rings true, for the
situation of teaching and is just where the issue with "distance
learning" is joined. The implication I value is that students and
teachers approach texts (and/or images) together, to see what they
can make of them. "Study under" in contrast implies subjection to
 authority of a kind that "distance learning" usually relies on.

Yes, I've taught on-line at the New School, on an asynchronous applica-
tion; I'm also working on synchronous appications with a grad student.
It's very difficult. It wouldn't be for teaching poetry, but it is for
a number of subjects. I teach the philosophy/psychology of the Net/
"Information Highway" stuff - the advantage is that the course deals
directly with current Net conditions/applications/politics/development
and the disadvantage is the long hours it takes to write up lectures that
would take only minutes to deliver - as well as a certain disconcerting
anonymity always present...

I agree that a 1-1 correspondence between punctuation & rhythm is probably
impossible, but there is a loose correspondence, one that can be useful to
poets when "scoring" the words to be spoken. And in today's post-grammatical
education system (I was taught at school to "use a comma where you'd take a
breath" - no mention of clauses etc) the correspondence might be tightening up.

I think that rhythm & rhetoric are very tightly interconnected - not surprising
given the origins of rhetoric in oratory. As well as the structure of logical
argument influencing written punctuation, which we make audible via rhythm &
intonation, is it not possible that the rhythms of oratory influenced the
structure of rational discourse? Perhaps someone with a better knowledge of
linguistic history can clarify this.

Perhaps we could take the line-break as a (the?) defining characteristic of a
poem (at least a "poetry" poem as opposed to a "prose" poem). I know that when
I write prose after writing too much (!) poetry, the margins seem an awfully
long way apart. That white space around a poem may be as important as the
words.

I've been involved in distance learning, but in a field totally unrelated to
poetry. The learners for whom I'm responsible cannot take time off work to
attend workshops or lectures, so I've had to rely on computer-based learning
that they can use in the workplace. One hypertext module that I developed (I
used HTML primarily because it's cheap) for local use is apparently used
regularly by Environment Canada for their training, since I linked the module
to my web pages.
 
I think the emphasis here is on _learning_ rather than _teaching_. Hypertext
and hypermedia work best when you have highly motivated learners _exploring_ a
field of interconnected knowledge, rather than reluctant learners who have to
be led through a course one step at a time. They are also sometimes the only
choice, when the learners are too far away or too busy to attend traditional
f2f lectures.
 
I've found this list and the EPC extremely valuable for learning about current
American poetry, and the Internet may be an ideal tool for this kind of
distance learning. I have the beginnings of an archive on NZ poetry on my web
pages - I wish I had the time and knowledge to make it more comprehensive. If
every time that one heard mention of a poet's name one could go and read some
of his or her poems on the web, together with hypertext links to essays and
bibliographies ... oh, how that would break down the "tyranny of distance" that
comes from living in a country where none of the bookshops have even heard of
Zukofsky or Olson!
 
 
Anyway, as far as online writing courses goes, I know that Rob Kendall has run
online courses on writing hypertext fiction, and I'm sure there are a lot more.
I can see great potential in using small listserv groups for semi-formal
tutorials - the tutor/facilitator sends out a group of poems to the
participants, who then discuss them on the list. Or, with better technology, a
linking of web pages with real-time Internet Relay Chat links - although one
would run into problems with time zones there.

Thanks, Cris, for your view from the other side of the performer/audience
divide. Remember I was a mile away in the gods in the first half so couldn't
always see too well, and tho the sound was basically good the famed Albert Hall
reverb got in the way of the semantics sometimes. I enjoyed your/Sianed's
performance, and indeed most of the evening. Sorry about the xmas tree
misconception... good one.
 
love, Ken

Yeah, Chris, I get that Zuk/Buk thing all the time--having dinner with a
prominent harvard Engdept person, he says to me, "you're working on
zukofsky?  I just got back from Germany, and he's the most popular
American poet there..."  Of course he meant Chas., not Louis.
 
Dodie:  the lowdown on the Zukofsky/Niedecker affair, such as is known of
it, is outlined in Glenna Breslin, "Lorine Niedecker:  Composing a Life,"
in _Revealing Lives:  Gender in Autobiography and Biography_, ed. Bell
and Yalom (Albany:  SUNY Press, 1990).  hard to assess what's true and
false.  The major sources of information on this are in large part people
who have bones to pick with Zukofsky, it seems to me.  Far more
interesting are the Niedecker letters edited by Jenny Penberthy
(Cambridge UP, 1993), which include almost nothing from the years when
the two were (one supposes) lovers.
 
What's clear is that Celia Zukofsky (born Thaew) was probably no richer
than Zukofsky himself.  According to Penberthy, Z and LN had reached a
"platonic resolution" to their affair--ie they were just "good
friends"--by 1936.  Zukofsky married in 1938, and Niedecker was a close
friend to the family thru the end of her life.

I was there too (something I'm not sure I'll be mentioning -- in a
casual/proud undertone -- to my grandchildren) and have enjoyed both Ken
and Cris's reports. I thought I should dash off some sort of response
quickly before I just let it go.
 
I don't think the explicit aspect of sixties throwback was sufficiently
highlighted (despite references to Donavan and Dylan). Two film clips were
shown (Ginsburg most prominent) of a famous event in '65 (I'm too 'young'
and wasn't in the UK until '69 anyway) at the same venue. Horovitz spoke of
'building on the "energies"' of the more current event for an Festival of
International Poetry next July. Whaaat?
 
And many in the audience were, I think, revenants experiencing flashbacks.
(I still can't quite construe the rubric: 'the return of the reforgotten'.)
Who were the others? I met few people I recognized from the 'subvoicive'
poetry circuits. Average age: thirty something? maybe younger. Certain
regions of the audience seemed to consist of older overdressed arts admin,
a little uncomfortable in the would-be art-rock-concert atmosphere. I also
detected strong contingents of the supposedly burgeoning 'poetry slam',
'open mike' groups -- vocal and cohesive, verging on (middle class white)
gang culture. The audience was *white*.
 
But the 60s film clips gave the lie. There was nothing anarchic, ambiguous,
evolving or challenging (I mean in respect of the audience/performer
relationship) about this event. The audience was audience. Nobody even
drank any absinthe (and this is the 90s).
 
There *was* a lot of applause. I clapped almost everything (sometimes
hating myself for doing so). My biggest disappointment was Douglas Oliver.
I too had accorded him the god-like status of difficult memory, but in this
context he seemed flat and I don't think this was simply because he was
'just reading'. Denise Riley's set gave the lie to this interpretation. I
think my greatest, *unexpected* delight was Kennelly Joyce/Holy Family
dinner party piece, already much remarked upon. Cris and Sianed's
performance I did much enjoy, and noticed the light responding to vocal
dynamics, effectively I thought.
 
There was a lot of applause, but there were also strong, mixed reactions.
As Aaron Williamson gave his truly *phonemenal* (sic) performance, a number
of people behind me (I was towards the back of the arena) laughed
repeatedly and loudly. I put it down to a 'very-English' unwillingness to
engage seriously with the extreme, the radical. I guess that, generally,
the organizers intended to re-radicalize our notion of poetry/language
arts. I believe that the event may have altered or undermined relatively
fixed notions of poetry in the minds of a small portion of the
(unconverted) audience, but just as many of them will have gone away
'put-off' by the more extreme alternatives. I have one good neighbour, a
serious, open-minded, sometime reader of poetry (a reader! a reader! one
who don't write!) -- though not so much of 'innovative poetics' -- who just
found the whole thing negative-extraordinary. Couldn't understand my
unwillingness to take it apart -- I want/wanted to love it so much. (Why?
Partly because it was not, and pointedly not, Heaney, NewGen, Nobel and
Co., blessed be their spade-like pens and dynamite diction.)
 
And the audience did, generally, like the two performers, Dunn and
Macartney, who I thought really sucked the big one, so I guess I'll have to
go on reading Kipling's 'If' and try to stay cool.
 
I gathered from Howard Marks introductory remarks that he was a big *soft*
drug-dealer ('the good weed' as he put it), recently released from jail.
Counter-culter in deed. His introductions were measured and excellent
(strong contrast with Moorcock). He spoke to the question of poetry's
influence in stimulating creative engagement and, if he was sincere, this
was a great tribute to the eclectic group he introduced.
 
But 'build on these energies' -- I fear it would be like trying to build on
a tangled heap of disparate threads.

Tom,
 
Your points are well taken.  I think my original spoonful of sugar comment
was too flippant, and I apologize for that.  It's just that I'm feeling a bit
jaded and discouraged in terms of reaching a broader audience.  I have laced
my work with so much "sugar" (sex, pop culture, horror, humor, narrative
even) that it could throw a weak reader into diabetic shock.  Yet, when I've
sent my work to presses whose books are geared to reach a wider
audience--some of which have published Kathy Acker and some of the poets on
this list--my work has been received as basically unmarketable gibberish.
 (Dalkey Archives is a notable exception.)  Friends of mine have taught my
work to undergraduates, who had no trouble understanding it--so what does
this say about people who control the publishing of prose?
 
If you can find a wider audience for your work, more power to you.
 
Personally, I like austere white wines, which makes me feel like a traitor to
my home state of California.  Those big fruity Chardonnays--yuck.

Mark,
 
Thank you for your thoughtful response concerning N&Z.  The person who took
me to visit her home last Friday did tell me that Niedecker stayed friends
with Zukowski, taking a special interest in his son.
 
My guide was really into telling one heart-wrenching story about her after
another, and I totally sucumbed to his mini-series version of her life.
 Things like how all her decisions were based on her writing, how when her
eyesight was going bad she quit her job proof-reading and washed floors for a
living--in order to save her eyes for writing.  Is this story true?  I
haven't the foggiest idea.  I stood there beside that sad little shack,
facing that shallow but dramatic river that threatened to eat up all the
land, looked at the poorness of the lives that the people there lead.  Then
my guide would talk about the glamor of New York that Zukowski offered her.
 And I wanted with all my heart for her to have had that glamor.  But could
those poems of hers have been written in an urban world?

All these "silly" lawn ornaments bearing the weight of all these other
cultural phenomena, remind me of Steven Shaviro's discussion of Night of the
Living Dead in his book The Cinematic Body.  Unfortunately, I don't have the
book here in Indiana, but I do have a passage from it I twisted and collaged
into the Letters of Mina Harker.  I used it to talk about Vampire's Secret
Ice Pops.  But, I'll substitute "lawn geese" for "ice pops"so you can see
what I'm talking about.
 
"These lawn geese are wildly discontinuous, flamboyantly antinaturalistic,
and nonsensically grotesque.  Yet the more ridiculously excessive and
self-consciously artificial they are, the more literal is their visceral
impact.  They can't be kept at a distance, for they can't be referred to
anything beyond themselves.  Their simulations are radically immediate:  they
no longer pretend to stand in for, or to represent, a previously existing
real."
 
I like the way symbolic tropes have been ripped from their context and stuck
on a goose, or a gnome.

Chris,
 
I stand corrected and shamed, with a big red Z emblazoned across my chest.
 
Yes, I'm horrible at typing and spelling.  Often "w"s are pronounced as
"v"s--so I gave it my old college try.  Actually, I never read Zuk in
college--though I did on my own in high school.  But I've never ever read
Buk.
 
You've unearthed my biggest weakness in posing as an intellectual--I know a
zillion times more about female writers than I do about male ones.  And I'm

You're such a clever young man.

dear tom,
        re. your listener who hadn't read C, but had been told to come
by a lecturer, and the Pavement reviewer who actually does know the
poetry well but gave you the impression he did not...these were i think
my other subject. I wasn't concerned to make a distinction between
active and passive readers but to point to members of the audience most
broadly conceived who have not read, heard, the work (yet, ever) at all.
i.e. there is a 'readership' of those who have received the work at one
or more removes. Once it is with them it is most fully in circulation.
When information, poems included, enters the bloodstream it get broken
down, it combines with other information willynilly and comes out holus
bolus,  gets written into new messages, echoed in shifting vocabularies
and accents of whole populations, gets confused with expressions of
love, the develop,ment of new product lines and the continued viability
of political platforms. None of this can be discerned by counting heads
at readings or understanding why salesmen snarl at those who demand
books by Louis Zukovsky.

Subject:      AWOL: Ulitarra Magazine
 
Ulitarra magazine
 
 
In 1991, Laura Danckwerts and Donald Westlake, then living on the mid-north
coast of New South Wales, entered into a partnership with MichaelSharkey
and Tony Bennett of Kardoorair Press in Armidale, to produce the first
issue of Ulitarra, which has been published twice a year since 1992.
 
As it has turned out, the format for that first issue - a mix of ideas from
disparate personalities - has now become the recognisable format for the
magazine: Les Murray suggested the name*, Michael Wilding the publication
of translations, Laura Danckwerts the committment to publishing some
Aboriginal writing in every issue, and Donald Westlake the poetry and short
story competitions. Robert Adamson became poetry editor with issue No 3, in
1993, and from the next issue, No 8, will been joined by J S Harry.
 
Four years later, the original partnership having dissolved, and Laura
Danckwerts and Donald Westlake having moved back to Sydney,the magazine has
a steadily growing list of subscibers and receives assistance from the NSW
Ministry for the Arts and the Literature Board of the Australia Council.
Ulitarra  is now self-sufficient in the sense that it no longer requires
private funding.
 
Since we started Ulitarra  it has grown from 64 to 146 pages per issue, and
now that we have gained confidence, we've put fiction where it rightfully
belongs, that is in the hands of new writers. In our first issue, 50% of
fiction was from high profile writers and 50% from new writers, but in our
latest issue, No 7, all the fiction is from writers ranging from those
being published for the first time, to those who are just about to be taken
on by the big publishers. We still publish well-known writers when we get
the chance, of course, but don't actively seek them in the way we did at
the beginning. We don't have a preference for genre. We'll publish anything
from a vignette, a traditional dramatic-form story, or a piece of realist
fiction, to the most outrageously unclassifiable post-modern experiment,
providing it has impact. We're always on the lookout for the ideosyncratic,
distinctive voice, the unusual narrative position.
 
Essays are more difficult. Whereas most of our fiction is unsolicited, we
have yet to receive an acceptable essay that way. Our essays so far have
been commissioned, with subject matter ranging through music and
architecture to the lives and works of the foreign writers we publish in
translation.
 
Poetry editor, Robert Adamson, says: all the poetry we publish is of very
high quality. I try to select as many poems as possible from those that are
sent to us unsolicited, and always include one or more poets who have never
been published before in each issue. Once we publish a poet we offer
continued support and publication as their careers develop.  With each
issue I consciously choose poems from the various factions that exists in
Australia, without favouring any one, and I encourage experimental writing.
I don't fill issues ahead of time, but make my final decisions just prior
to publication.
 
There's a great deal of hard work and certainly no money in editing
Ulitarra  We seem to be driven by a simple love of literature and a drive
towards what we perceive as excellence. Sometimes we despair of the
workload, but in every case, the published issue makes it worthwhile.
Writers and readers and editors and publishers are all in this thing
together, they're symbiotic. But the writer's art is represented by asingle
piece of prose or poetry, whereas ours is in the planning of each issue,
the juxtaposition of pieces, and finally the palpable volume itself,  to be
felt, flipped through, read and enjoyed. Each issue is like a newborn
child. In every instance, we always feel as we've really achieved
something.
 
Ulitarra  runs a poetry competition and a short story competition annually.
Winners are published in the magazine and receive a cash prize. The
December issue is launched as part of the Sydney Writers' Festival each
year, at Gleebooks in Glebe, together with the presentation of the short
story prize to the winner.
 
 *Ulitarra (or Yuludarra) was the first hero ancestor of the Koori tribes
of the mid-north coast of New South Wales. He came from the land where the
sun rises, shaped the landforms, and fathered and named the tribes. He
taught them their languages and particularty the art of storytelling. He
now lives somewhere in the sky.
 
Submissions to Ulitarra  are always welcome and should be sent to PO Box
392, French's Forest, NSW, 2086. Single issues cost $8, and a year's
subscription $15.

Dodie, picking up on possible name-varients, is Lorine Niedecker's name
still mis-spelled on her grave, or have the local enthusiasts fixed it?
When I visited (about this time of year ten years ago) it was NEIDECKER
and yes, I too met the gravedigger, soused in his own beer at the little
bar down at the point. The gremlins do get to that name from time to time
- when we published "Harpsichord & Salt Fish", we proofread like blazes -
and still ended up with NEIDECKER on the bloody title page... Sometimes
keyboards, pens and chisels are all too light.
 
The No.1Fan - that would be Karl Gartung? I too was taken by, etc etc.
The river was in flood, a flock of grackles wheeled around us, and a
local guide said, "Lorine n Al used to call that garage "University of
Texas", never could figure why..." And reminisced about Al falling in the
river and soaking his paycheck etc... So much for the oral tradition. But
it's good to see the place - I like to horrify both Romantics and
Objectivists by pointing out how similar the enviroment of Rock River /
Lake Koshkonong is to the Peterborough fens in Clare's day.
 
As to the LN/LZ affair, I follow Mark's reading of it (and direction to
Penberthy's ed. of the letters) - would only add that, as I see it, it
was never on to expect LN to shift to New York, or LZ to shift (other
than visit) to Lake Koshkonong, or either to shift to another place etc
etc.

My knowledge of the particulars of Niedecker's life is embarassingly

(just as one can only wonder what Zukofsky would have written if he, like
Leslie Fiedler, were exiled to Missoula).
 
In case there are some date-fascists out there, yes, I got the year of
LZ's marriage wrong--1939, not 1938.

Study With.  Yes.  I think a very demanding field for a 'teacher,' esp.

there can be much more of a relation between teacher/student.  I am all for
different ways of learning, and question the authoritarian model...  But
I know from experience that distance learning has allowed me a *space*
to voice my needs as a student - and I have realized that learning to
communicate is essential to allowing oneself to be taught.
I have learned more from communicating personally with both professors and

This CD-ROM is still under construction, or rather construction has been
suspended.  110 Press is Bruce Kijewski and friends, some refugees from
Voyager, who would like to produce poets/writers in this format and have
the same difficulties as start-up small presses, except that the
equipment costs are prohibitive without financial backing.  They taped a
reading of the whole work in L.A. several years ago, were dissatisfied
with the sound, didn't release the disk, and would like to do it again.
Several of us remain skeptical of this format, which seems confined to
text + talking head in a little box.  I just bought PiM2, with its
surprizingly interesting list of poets, and will see what they've been
able to do as soon as I can find the disk holder.
An interesting note: I was able to "obtain" the electronic rights to my
published work from (Rupert Murdoch's) HarperCollins simply by asking for
them.  I now have a letter assignment me those rights, which I thought
was very strange, until one considers that these houses are not yet very
sophisticated about these matters (witness the quality of their own
elecontronic productions) and, of course, there is no need for them to
protect their ownership of poetry which is worth (as has been observed on
this list) less than blank paper.
I'm much more intrigued by hyper-text than by CD-ROM.  The latter doesn't
seem to do more with poetry than can be done with print and video.  I'd
be interested to hear what others think...

Dodie,
 
For a while there, I was under the impression that I actually
am related to the late, great Zukofsky--I've told so many poets,
"Nope, no relation."
 
Anyway, I'm still inspired.
 
Thanks for bringing up the subject and the clarification.

Bart:
You're right when you say we're having a problems with definitions.
Before you have poetry, you have to have a Poet, with all its
attendent ideologies of individuality and genius.
You mention B. (sorry, I generally spell his name about 33   different
ways and none of them are correct) and symbolic capital. I suggest that
it is not poetry unless it is the means for symbolic capital.
All people may have poetry, just as all people have music, or soul, or
whatever, but not all people have Brahms. This is not a value. Brahms
means darkened halls, tuxedoes, gowns and sophisticated  chatter.
We need to contextualize what we mean by "west," because in one sense
there is no such thing and in another sense there is nothing else for
us and us only.
Writing it down is all we know at this point. To pretend otherwise is
to forget monopoly capitalism, the interiorization of literacy, the
deployment of sexuality, etc. etc. To forget administration.
     Poetry is a specific kind of overdetermined historical writing.
There are other things. There are Hallmark cards and song lyrics and
spells. But none of them are taught and none of them are sanctioned.
     Thanks, Eric.

I don't quite understand the construction, "before you have poetry you
have to have a poet."  It seems that,whether one wants to think on
Marx or on Neitzsche or on neither, the subject or the historical
individual is, at least in some senses both epistemologically and
ontologically and certainly etho-aesthetically an effect rather than
the cause of something as complex as language as poetry or the act
of making something called poetry.  Besides POET, as opposed to
poetaster or more recent flames from taste wars, is an overwrought or
highly crafted epithet. No?  just a random question or so.

The sound on the first disk wasn't so great either, at least not on the copy
I heard/saw. The friend who bought it wound up sending it back for just that
reason. Picture quality (was it Loss who mentioned this?) was also not so
good. Anyone know if they used the film or video for the CD? The CD was fun
to play w/ for one evening, but lacked the fluidity & rhythmic punch of the
film as I recall it.
 
I think Carolyn's right that the technological form is basically limited. SF
MOMA has similar CD's available, where one can view pictures & hear
interviews, which is even more limited. It gives you nothing mmore than a
book can, & the reproductions' quality is worse. At least w/ poetry, you hear
the reader's voice & pacing & performance style. Wish I could check out the
Little Mag, but I don't know anyone w/ an IBM CD-ROM.
all best,
Charles

Subject:      Re: LN & LZ
 
Just read today Dodie's description of Lorine's home w/ much appreciation.
I'm one of those bi-coastal types who's never been to the mid-west.
 
Dodie asks:
" But could
those poems of hers have been written in an urban world?" Perhaps not w/ the
place-specific content of her work she's so often remembered by. The
importance of Jenny Penberthy's scholarship has been to demonstrate LN's
commitment to avant-garde writing practices beginning at an early
(pre-Zukofsky) period of her life & continuing thruout. As important as I
believe Niedecker's work is to an innovative poetics of place (& of the
noun), Jenny has shown that Niedecker contributed to a whole range of
innovative practices which she equally deserves to be recognized for. Witness
how well the selection in Messerli's anthology stands up to current practice.
Much of Niedecker's material came out of her reading & letters which don't
depend on living in rural WI. LN definitly had a cosmopolitan sense of
herself.
 
I believe at this point there's no debate as to an affair between Niedecker &
Zukofsky, & that she terminated a pregnancy (twins I heard). I've heard from
Cid Corman & Carl Rakosi that Zukofsky "passed her off" to his friend Jerry
Reisman, & that yes, the fact she wasn't Jewish was a factor in the
non-continuance of their relationship. Are either of these "true"?-I don't
know. Celia was by no means rich, but apparently did have a small amount of $
to bring to the marriage-an amount that was significant at that time.
 
as to:
"Niedecker stayed friends
with Zukowski, taking a special interest in his son."
&
"Niedecker was a close
friend to the family thru the end of her life."
 
There's an obvious psychological reading of her interest in the young Paul
Zukofsky, & it was an interest Celia apparently didn't always appreciate.
Though Niedecker remained devoted to him, Zukofsky did turn from her, as he
did from most of his friends during the 60's. Penberthy notes his refusal to
write an introduction for her collected, _T & G_, and his lack of
contribution to the festschrift Jonathan Williams put together, _Epitaphs For
Lorine_. Not to demonize LZ-his late-life bitterness is all too poignant, but
he seems to have been so poisoned by it as to be incapable of maintaining
relationships outside the family. There's a sense that her correspondence
with Corman in the 60s compensated for the fading relationship w/ LZ.
 
Anyway, the good news for LN readers is that a batch of papers escaped the
great conflagration (Al Millen's posthumous burning of her papers at her
request) which contain notes used in the Lake Superior sequence. Jenny
Penberthy is currently working on them. Something to look forward to! There's
also some fascinating research material LN compiled on the Grand Canyon.
Unclear as to whether it was dropped from the sequence (perhaps an early
conception of 'the mineral'?), or intended for an other poem altogether.

Subject:      Albert Hall
 
John brings up the dark underbelly of this event, quite rightly. These were
all too present in every aspect at every stage - before, during and after
'the show'.
 
Were all those who took part co-opted, by association or implication, onto
the naive committees of the 1965 platform? (doesn't this ring bells for the
Apex of Briefs?)
 
A fundamental ambivalence towards culture as a capital of identity was
being re-negotiated within a capital of Culture. (although I would argue
that the challenge was to set up sufficiently thorny complexities of
resistance so as to generate nervous laughter  -  as that which John
witnessed  -  a refusal to engage with the radical signalling a
preparation)
 
Here was one of the last travelling circuses from the fifties and sixties
(Time Out apparently previewed it as a safe haven for beards and berets)
and here were some of its last 'maverick' fading constellations. I.E. here
witness the passing (the packagaing or 'pasting') of a bygone time, bygone
agenda and bygone aspirations with which we all became complicit. There,
one more backwater navigated and mapped. The Children of the E-Volition
(The Return of the Reforgotten). A strange collection of curios from beyond
the pale. An exercise in museology.
 
Difference was supressed in favour of active celebration of diversity  -
big political mirror balls  -  but hybridity was introduced through some of
the work and that residue provides the most positive and resonant strategy
from this event. Now I feel that's the energy that could be built on. But
was anyone paying much attention? The audience (yes John you're absolutely
right on its insistence to be an audience) found it hard to resist the
impulse to live out nostalgia for the fantasy most had already missed out
on  -  when McCartney was introduced the Albert Hall itself almost screamed
a teenage scream.
 
The political illusion of spectatorial Time travel is indeed become more
possible  -  and its allure scares the pith from me,
 
peace, love and puppet

Now that I'm back in Milwaukee I have access to all the Zukofsky (I'll never
forget how to spell that name) any girl could want.
 
This past year I wrote an article for a free weekly on a religious cult.  One
of the techniques members of the cult use is called The Golden-Tongued
Wisdom.  The basis of this is that spirit speaks to us in strange ways.  So,
to use The Golden-Tongued Wisdom, what you do is that you form a question in
your mind on which you'd like some guidance--and then the answer will come to
you by something you will hear in a passing conversation on the street, or in
the lyrics of a song on the radio, in a street sign, etc.  You can also open
a book with your question in mind, and the first thing you come upon in the
book will be spirit's reply.
 
So, thinking about all this discussion of Zuk, Buk, and Niedecker, I asked
for some sort of summary as I opened Zukofsky's _Complete Short Poetry_.
 This is what I saw:
 
Sculptures
        in the shadow
of round
        wall--
 
Primitive
        monumental
nameless

Much of Niedecker's material came out of her reading & letters which don't
depend on living in rural WI. LN definitly had a cosmopolitan sense of
herself.
 
I'd be interested in other's take on this notion of cosmopolitan/midwestern
(Smith earlier confesses to his own bi-coastal never-been-to-the-midwest
nature. My own take on Niedecker, while acknowledging her reading and
correspondence, would not be to say her sense of herself, and her subsequent
poetics, depended on a cosmopolitan nature, rather that perhaps literary
innovation, current practice, avant-garde poetics, etc. -- have far less to
do, of necessity, with the urban, than is often presumed by many. I have
long contended that one could be as avant-garde in central Kansas, Oklahoma,
Nebraska, Wisconsin -- as anywhere. Particularly in today's connected
electronic world, but also in Niedecker's day.

Since most writers I know in NY or SF are not natives there, shall I assume
they have been exiled there? and that such exile is pleasant or unpleasant?

By using the word "cosmopolitan," I wasn't really referring to an urban/rural
or mid-west/coastal split, but simply that Niedecker had a firm grasp on
current international literary trends (long before she met LZ). Penberthy's
quite convincing that her early interest in surrealism is sustained
throughout her career, despite Zukofsky's desire to wean her from it.
 
Charles Alexander is quite correct that writers can be cutting-edge no matter
where they live. The geographical spread of this list provides ample
testimony. Even Kansas: there's Ron Johnson & Ken Irby. Cultural centers, be
they NY, Paris, or SF, always seem to think they're more important than is
actually the case.

ample testimony. Even Kansas: there's Ron Johnson & Ken Irby. Cultural
centers, be they NY, Paris, or SF, always seem to think they're more
important than is actually the case."
 
Given how much the NY School depended on Tulsa, OK, the case is proven.
But, historically, metro centers have proven vital primarily because
they brought people into contact. Ken Irby was the first poet I ever
saw, a regular at the Med coffee house on Telegraph Ave in Berkeley
circa '64, writing into a notebook. Johnson was introduced to large
portions of the literary universe by Jonathon Williams (a cultural
center all by himself wherever he happens to be), then lived for 20
years in SF. Last time I talked with Kenneth, a little over a year ago,
he had seen Johnson exactly once since he'd moved back to Kansas.
 
Older writers have (again, historically) needed that sort of contact
far less than younger ones. The constant contact of a scene helps
younger ones to define themselves as poets, to push themselves further
than they might have gone under other circumstances. Certainly there
are poets in In the American Tree who might never have published, let
alone widely, had they lived all their lives in Missoula. And the
relative obscurity, say, of Paul Piper (a fine experimental poet long
active in Missoula) to some degree proves the point.
 
The internet and the communications revolution that it offers (this
here list is a model T compared to what will be coming in 5 to 10
years) may well change this. And if it means that poets need not be
isolated due to geographic remoteness, well then it's a good thing.

 Specifically to Maria Damon....although I have little experience
 (or none) teaching at the level of the university, I must say that I've
 heard and felt much angst from fellow students abt. the creative/theoretical
 split w/in workshops, etc. Some feel that theory-people get _out of hand_
 or tend to dominate discussion w/solely theoretical constructs...and
 the folks who would rathr focus on the _writing_ aspect feel the workshop
 turns into a seminar or colloquia...seems to me (and I do agree w/you
 about bringing in say, foucault, marx, etc) there _should_ be an exploration
 into _all_ methods of discourse, for this certainly enriches the praxis
 of creating, writing/sound/visual mediums. I think of the San Fransisco
 _movement_, Spicer, Duncan, Blaser, et al and how their pedagogical
 ideas/methds were worked into the process of thinking/writing/creating..
 I mean, what are the limits? I do feel, however, a need for a _balance_
 w/in the _conventional_ classroom, just speaking from my experiences
 w/in the state university of new york system...a balance within the types
 of discourse or _theory_ used and the discussion of the student's writing...
 hoping to make sense,

Uh, yeah. Okay.
     I think (but I am not sure) that I agree with you and you agree with me.
Poet is an affect (effect).
 
All I meant was that the idea of a poet only comes about when the idea of
individual creation comes about. IE, for the most part, the "creators" of
Illiad, Beowulf, etc. would not consider themselves creators as such.
It seems as if in fact they used formulas, linguistic, narrative, etc.
to complete their work which apparently changed from performance to
performance.
 
This is all part of my continuing obsession with stating the obvious.
 
When the idea of poets come into being, they have already joined the court.
Since then, it is amazing how many poets have pined over reactionary,
imaginary fantasies of the past, childhood, nature, fairies. There are
always exceptions, but those, I think, represent an emerging class,
such as Milton, or maybe even Blake.
 
Having said so, and lets not forget where this discussion started, I do
think that poetry, in its connection to both language and sexuality,
because I think the most inclusive definition of poetry is simply
something like tropic play (although I don't think we can pretend
that everyone thought so) that poetry rehearses a possibility of
profound criticism.
 
In other words, something like, poetry offers a way to imagine
something else....
 
     Thanks, Eric.

Subject:      cd-ro(a)m
 
  wanted
 
 to try a response to Carolyn's posting from a couple of days ago, &
 wishing her message were here to quote - it was an update &
 description of a cd-rom project for _The Country Between Us_ -- she
 mentions she is more interested in hypertext than cd-rom, among
 other things. . .
 
 to agree there are a lot of foibles and difficulties with digital
 multimedia technology as is. & that the "talking head" motif
 definitely stales quickly.
 
 to couple thoughts about the translation of writing into the new
 media, because I think there are plusses & possibilities in "cd-rom" &
 whatever it becomes. Of course, "hypertext" & html bring numerous
 agreeably exciting paths to follow. hopefully someone's reading along
 them, and there is depth to it. perhaps complicating matters (a bit)
 along the way, some computers allow texts to engage image, sound,
 and symbol on the computer screen - reading words attached to
 sounds attached to images, and so on.
 
 to say i was thinking of carolyn's project & quick ideas as to what
 could be done with it instead of just having CF on the screen looking
 like she's lip-synching her poems (this is what most of _Poetry In
 Motion_ amounts to -- & even if the poetry/words are stellar, it's
 almost comical to watch the writers so prosthetic!). A few things
 come to mind. To widen the scope of the text you could link the
 poems to corresponding journal entries, letters, or images of the
 people/places you're writing about, to give further depth of process.
 your voicings of the poems could be continuous or discrete, & you'd
 have the words as they appear in the book, you could put in drafts of
 the poems (illustrating processual dimensions for scholars & others
 curious). you could put in there other textual interconnections, like
 research done on El Salvador (evidence), interviews done with
 writers & people of central america, and so on. there could be
 another section of the text which places the poems in context of other
 poems which have been written out of similar circumstances or are
 otherwise stylistically connected (I like how the annotated _HOWL_
 has this). where what might be unfamiliar words, phrases, or
 languages, or where the words are associated with a particular
 history, a reader could access reference/background information via
 direct link (instant index). this seems like simple stuff so far. it'd be
 great to have a lot of cultural - historical contextualization in there -
 the stuff about which people feel so impassioned - the materials
 which attracted you this culture. do you see as much pedagogical
 value in this as i do?
 
 A lot of information can be stored on these plastic discs, so what
 we're conceiving is an expanded book -- and more than a book (or
 video)-on-tape with bibliography. Yes, the technical difficulties are
 preventative. However, we're years from realizing a finalized
 formula for producing writing in this media. There are limits to what
 the technology will do, but really the biggest limitation, as far as I
 can tell, so far, is the lack of applied thought in engineering literature
 for hypermedia. This will change. However, so far, most of the people
 creating literary publications using digital multimedia haven't really
 begun to challenge themselves to produce poetry in more than a
 perfunctory manner.* In other words, most titles commercially
 produced thus far are severely lacking with regards to imaginatively
 using the media (again, at least as far as literature goes ((& maybe
 "literature" isn't well suited for multimedia translation?)). not that i'd
 suggest that the recently produced Little Magazine cd-rom uses the
 form with admirable vision either, but we did make a steady effort
 to project the "writing" presented with a variety of approaches &
 allowed interpretive rather than (or, in addition to) literal renderings
 of poems on the screen throughout the magazine.
 
 There probably hasn't been much significant exploration/discovery with
 experiments in "poetry" and "cyberspace", though the EPC might be
 proven an exception to this statement. R. Bertholf & co. at the Poetry
 Archive are working on what could be an amazing hypertext of
 _Ulysses_ , with visual & hypertext aspects. perhaps there are other
 important projects happening? Recently I heard that the poet R.
 Tillingast, at U of Michigan, is getting 5 million dollars from Time-
 Warner to make a cd-rom of poets writing verse which emanates
 from the art in the museum at Ann Arbor. It'll be interesting to see
 what ways people find to present/publish work implementing new
 forms in the decades ahead.
 
 
 
 *For instance, with some friends watched _Poetry in Motion II_
 yesterday & it is indeed slick & a full plate of little quirky videos of
 the poets in performance and interview scenarios. (Bob Holman
 looking younger, wilder and all in all more like a furry rodent than
 he does now). All of the pieces share the same basic design -- there's
 a uniform template upon which all the words and video sections
 appear: video segments on the left of the screen, words to the right.
 there are two versions of each alphabetic text for a reader to choose
 from, the "printed" version (ie how it appears in the author's book),
 and the "performed" version (which is usually quite similar to the
 "printed" version) - so nothing remotely groundbreaking here. Every
 "video" shows the author performing her/his writing in documentary
 type performance segments. There are bibliographies and minimal
 biographical information, and a brief introduction by Robert Creeley,
 none of these features make use of sophisticated multimedia
 devicing.

It's fascinating to read the various threads of the discussion of poetry on
cd-rom, hypertext, online, etc., particularly Christopher Funkhouser's most
recent post, with its notion that the possibilities are untapped as of yet.
Because it seems to me that we are also far from completely fulfilling
(particularly in poetry publications) the possibilities of the technology of
the book as well. I don't know what this may suggest for creative use of
electronic media in years to come, that the book settled, perhaps rather
early in its history, for a rather limited use of its possibilities. Will
electronic media do so as well? Will books wake up and continue to expand?

Aldon and Dodie, just so that we can discuss this like brew bloods let's
define our terms.
 
Gnomes are dwellers in the earth. Little people, mostly presumed benevolent
-  EC passports.
 
Trolls are supernatural, generally more gnarled than gnomes, more unstable
in their ambivalent facets and Scandinavian. (You'll doubtless remeber
their spectacular intervention in Ibsen's 'Peer Gynt'.
 
Neither gnomes nor Trolls appear in much poetry that I know of, whereas
Fairies are the digitally imaged spirits of syntax.

Certainly as late as the 60s and 70s, there was a decided tension
between versions of an avant-garde tradition and those "viable academic
institutions" of the world. Neither the NY School nor the SF
Renaissance depended very much on teaching for a living (Koch being the
notable exception), at least at that point. The Black Mountain poets
did, and it accounted to some degree for their greater geographic
dispersal.
 
For poets who thought of teaching, then, the problem was one of not
just getting the degree and then a job, but also recognizing how the
academic process would tend to send one outward, to the suburbs and
hinterlands. For several, that seemed too high a price to pay. One
reason many poets have ended up, say, in the computer industry is that
one has much greater control over where to live (not to mention better
working conditions and better pay).
 
As programs emerged that were not actively hostile to progressive
interpretations of literature (UC San Diego, Naropa, New College, then
Buffalo, Brown, Bard, etc.), it dramatically altered the world for
younger poets, who no longer needed to wade through an actively hostile
environment for benefit of a degree.
 
San Francisco State has had many terrific poets among its students not
because it's creative writing program is any good (it's dismal and has
been dismal for 30 years) or because the poets emerging from it get
jobs (very few do), but because young poets were able to convince
themselves and/or their parents that it was the viable means for
getting to San Francisco. Wouldn't shock me to learn the same of the
program at Columbia.

Misspellings come and go (and let's add Rupert Brooke to our list of
recent Poetics list casualties) and don't really hurt - why, Aneirin's
circulation is way up on anything he had in his lifetime, and a quick
count suggests four published versions of his name...
 
But the generalisations about LN's homeworld, and the disparaging tone of
phrases like "sad little shack" and "the poorness of the lives" are more
important: (a) they show a real failing to read LN, her enduring
commitment to and concern for that place and its lifeforms, as it's
asserted over and over in the poems (and for those who still won't trust
poems, it's in her letters too) (b) they suggest a failure to read the
lives of the people who live there at other than the most superficial
level (in the manner of those papers of central government which outline
the case for the "resettlement of the rural poor") (c) they contribute,
albeit unwittingly, to the continuing patronisation (sic) and writing-down
of Niedecker's achievement as "poor little home-body" or "mute inglorious
milton" - in a way which I find unsupportable.
 
A sympathetic, unblinkered reading of the place would be a valuable asset
in reading Niedecker. I worry that such a reading becomes less likely
between the local heritage brigade and the blank incomprehension of
tourists.

Subject:      BAAAAAAD villanelle!
 
I'd love some response to the following dilemma, since I'm not totally
sure what I make of it:
 
Here's the scene: a small, friendly discussion among several poets after
a reading in Washington, D.C. I put forward the notion that experimental
innovation is actually possible with forms regularly considered
"traditional", that is, that one can actually use things like
villanelles and sonnets in potentially intriguing ways. I am told kindly,
but firmly, that I am incorrect--these forms are dead, over and done
with, BAAAAAAD, just plain too closed to merit further discussion. (I
won't say who told me I was incorrect, but since some of them are on this
list, I'd love for them to jump in--it was without doubt a friendly
discussion, so the difference here is not at all a personal one).
 
I protest, giving some examples (Ashbery's double sestina in FLOW CHART),
not giving some more effective examples that I might have used--from those
terrible
neo-formalists Bernadette Mayer and Ted Berrigan (who published sonnets)
or the unregenerate conservatism of a poet like Charles Bernstein who's
actually WRITTEN, may God forgive him, a villanelle--"Thrush"--. My
examples are not persuasive to the gathered group (I even mentioned Henry
James, saying it wasn't clear to me that James "realism" had as its only
fuction the maintaining of the "dominant representational culture", but
hey, I think Shakespeare's pretty radical too), and at this point I am told
that
I'm actually in danger of siding with people like Mark Strand if I don't
watch out.
 
So, what does anyone think? Is the mere use of some forms destined to
sully one as an anti-innovative neo-formalist? Is my raising such a
question evidence of my "drifting over to the other camp (this is a war
here boy, and don't you forget it!)." Can villanelles or sonnets be used
experimentally, or not? Is a form itself BAAAAAAD, or is there some truth
to my perception that it's not the form itself, but the people who
promote certain forms in certain ways that are really the problem?
 
        It used to be true that traditional formalists were the only
people who could tell others what forms they cant use. Now, in some cases
anyway,
avant garde poets can also tell people what they can't do. Is this
progress? Some day I want to ask a poet the question
"what can I do with poetry?" and have the answer be something other than
"The only thing you can do is what I'm doing already."
 
        I hope the people who were part of this discussion will
understand that i'm saying this here in a friendly spirit, albeit perhaps
a mischevious one.
 
 
        On a related subject, I think Ron Silliman has an excellent point
when he says that we need to historicize the role that "theory" has
played in experimental poetries. The freedom that literary theory allowed
poets like Ron was crucial, and to some extent, literary theory still
allows that freedom. But now that "theory" is such a definite part of any
sophisticated graduate school experience, it's hard to see it simply as
"freeing." Some people may argue that literary theory is not responsible
for its codification inside American academies, but on the other hand,
it's hard not to think that the obvious "authority" of tone in writers like
Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, D and G, Lyotard, etc,  is to some extent
complicitious with the authority-making process of intellectual
reputations and academic power, although the insight such
writers allow are unquestionably crucial. But I think of William Burroughs
response
to someone who said "The Christian God is not responsible for what has
been done in His name," which was "A God is ALWAYS responsible for his
followers." To what extent is a text responsible for what can be done
with it?
 
Ah well. Perhaps one generation's freedom is always the next generation's
burden.

Mark,
 
One could be old-fashioned and insist that you have to follow the path
of most resistance--pick up your copy of the Handbook of Poetic Forms by
e-mailing to yours truly at Teachers & Writers Collaborative--and then
one could opt for an even more out-of-date path... e.g. do what you want
to when you want to if you can hear how to... discussions among poets
about what is and isn't possible... are nonsense

Mark,
 
I would add to your list of innovative formal undertakings:
 
*   Queneau's Sonnets -- 10 to the 14th power [probability suggests that
                         many of his sonnets have never actually been
                         read]
 
*    Robinson's Six Sonnets & Eight Etudes -- the etudes are less form
                          driven than the sonnets, but are mentioned
                          here nonetheless...
 
*    Perec's La Disparation -- a lippogrammatic novel (may be suspect
                         among those who don't approve of prose)
 
*    Waldrop's Anagrams
 
*    Mathews' Eye- Rhyme Sonnets -- the "rhyme words" appear to the eye only
                        as rhymes

Two disparate events announcements (one with a question) that folks here
may be interested in.
 
From November 15-19 at Mills College in Oakland, there's what looks to be a
very good conference/festival devoted to the work of John Cage with papers,
performances, films, etc, with much reference to his verbal works as well
as his musical ones. There's a vast amount of information on the event at:
 
http://newalbion.com/artists/cagej/herecomes.html
 
Also, I just received a mailing from the British Society for the Promotion
of New Music that includes an advert for the Huddersfield Contemporary
Music Festival (over the same weekend) including the 2nd performance
anywhere of a 1966 work by Terry Riley called Olson III for chorus.
 
I've seen scant references to this work before, & the other new music folks
I've asked can't answer this, so does anyone on poetics know if the piece
uses a text by Charles Olson & if so which text?
 
Thanks

Obviously this is addressed to my post, but rather than making a personal
address, Richard decided to use to use a larger more patronizing (sic) tone
in responding.  I don't think I said anything disparaging about Niedecker or
the people who live there.  I don't know the people who live there, but it's
clear that compared to the middle class lives of most of the poets I know,
their lives are quite humble, and Niedecker's cottage is not some Romantic
little fairy tale hut, especially now that it hasn't been kept up for
years--it looks like my father's tool shed.  In my post I was determinately
giving a slightly-parodied version of my experience as a tourist confronting
the romance of her myth.  It was in a way a revisioning her, of turning her
from the "old lady who writes nature poems" into a kind of lusty Barbara
Stanwick figure.
 
I never heard of Niedecker until the early 80s, when we studied her in
Kathleen Fraser's (or is it Frazier's? tee hee) Feminist Poetics class.  Each
woman in the class of thirty or so had to prepare a class presentation on a
woman poet.  Kathleen handed out a list of women poets that was passed from
one student to another.  You were to pick the woman poet you wanted to report
on and place your name next to hers.  The list started with the woman next to
me and went around the room in the opposite direction, so that I was the last
to sign my name.  The only poet left on the list was LN.  "Shit" I thought as
I jotted my name besides hers.  Back then I was still pretty wild and
relatively young--I couldn't think of anything more boring than reading LN.
 But, Kathleen was gently encouraging and very helpful, pointing me to
sources, lending me books.  Niedecker's surface was hard to penetrate, but
gradually her work opened to me, and the more I read her, the more I
appreciated her.  I still don't exactly adore her, but I do read her with
great fondess and respect.
 
Richard must know who the people are who doesn't take Niedecker seriously,
since everybody I know (who's heard of her) takes her quite seriously.  I
think that Niedecker's not being taken seriously as a writer, by whomever, is
not a historical anomaly.  Isn't the traditional position of women--as that
of little figures in the midst of big movements?

p.s. Someone pointed out to me that when I wrote in a previous post "cream
puffs as big as your head" it sounded like I meant a specific person's head.
 In fact, I meant "cream puffs as big as one's head."  I apologize if I
ruffled any feathers with my sloppy language.

INTEL ANNOUNCES PC-TV MARRIAGE  10/23/95
 
By JOHN MARKOFF
New York Times
 
In a step toward blending the personal computer and the Internet with
broadcast television, Intel Corp. and many of the nation's largest personal
computer makers and television broadcasters today announced a new technology
to allow broadcasters to deliver computer data along with their television
programs.
 
Intercast, which was developed by Intel researchers over the past two years,
will allow broadcasters to transmit data in a portion of the television
signal known as the vertical blanking interval -- at speeds almost four times
as fast as the fastest available modems now used to send personal computer
data to the home.
 
The data would be transmitted in the blank lines visible to television
viewers only when their sets are on the fritz. This bank of 10 or so lines is
isolated at one end of the television image, and out of the frame of a
television set that is operating normally. Each of these lines can be used to
transmit data at a speed of 9,600 bits a second.
 
Although the system is based on a one-way broadcast model and the television
signals would be pulled in by a standard television tuner, the data will be
delivered in the form of World Wide Web pages, permitting interactivity
through conventional Internet access.
 
Twelve concerns are endorsing the new standard: Packard Bell and Gateway
2000, which both plan on including the hardware necessary to receive the
Intercast signals in computers they will sell next year; the broadcasters
NBC, CNN, QVC and WGBH, the Boston PBS station; the cable operators Viacom
and Comcast, the on-line service provider America Online and the software
developers Asymetrix, En Technology and Netscape Communications.
 
Intel has made the standard as open as possible -- meaning that other
manufacturers can adopt the system without needing licensing agreements --
and would not derive any revenue directly from the technology. The company
would make money as customers bought more personal computers and thus more
Intel microprocessors.
 
The technology, which now requires about $50 to $60 worth of parts, consists

The discussion Mark is mentioning was a bit more complex than he's
rhetorically reconstructed it for list consumption. One of the questions
being "do certain forms reinscribe dominant cultural norms" & the other side
of that "can new forms play a role in altering those forms."
 
I tend to believe that new forms can & do play a role in changing individual
perceptions of the world, & therefore if experienced by enough people
(experienced through participation, rather than observation)-- *might*
conceivably play some role in changing the social interaction of individuals.
 
 
Perhaps the point to be made with regard to teaching is that intentions are
primary-- if new forms are treated as old forms have been-- as unquestioned
models to be copied-- we're not really moving in a desirable direction.
Perhaps the "jazz" workshop described on this list in which poets wrote poems
in response to each others work, rather than relying on discursive critique--
 is an example of open form for the classroom, as projective verse is an
example of open form for the page. So no form can be seen as inherently
superior-- it's meaning is it's use. As unfortunately, our meaning (in many
but not all ways) is our use by the workplace. In our current context it
seems to me certain forms can lead us toward perceptions of life as process
rather than predetermined value, & (O utopian fool!) toward seeing that
people matter more than money.

Subject:      Recent DC readings
 
To mention some recent DC readings-- Joan Retallack & Carolyn Forche read
yesterday to much appreciation. Joan reading from _A F T E R R I M A G E S_,
the highlight for me being "ICARUS FFFFFalling"-- which wound  about in
pig-latinate first-rate well-paced portent. Carolyn read from _The Angel of
History_ & a few "outtakes" which seemed in the air at least-- as though they
cld have been inclusions. The highlight for me being the final section,
"Book Codes" -- I've always been impressed by the complex populism of her
work, and her ability to sustain that while moving into an interest in
fragmention(s) is satisfying & promising.
 
Week ago Jordan Davis & Bill Luoma gave us an NYC instance-- both funny,
very. & laid back & lyric in that remapped gramatic
& lastingly undidactic kinda sorta way.
 
Same weekend Barrett Watten regaled us with a new piece called "Ambivalent
About Poetry" -- short in duration, visual, & replete. Also read new & old
"Bad History"(s)-- a favorite of mine being on the Bay Area area code
"415/510" schism. Bits of _Leningrad_, & the _Aerial_ frontispiece (which I
was glad to hear as I hadn't been sure of my decoding of some of his
handwriting.) BW's insistent critique of "the pointilist economy" continues.
 
I had my first slam appearance last night, read some collaborations & my
prayer for the "On Your Knees, Citizen" project for the _New Censorship_
(yes, that is going to happen, thanks to those that sent "prayers"). & then
did a multi-voice bit with help from Mark Wallace, Heather Fuller, & Buck
Downs.
A few of the lines flying about the room included: "Coca Cola Classic Tastes
Just Like Chicken," "I hereby declare bankruptcy on my emotional debts," "411
is a joke," & the inimitable David Ayre's deeply felt "I'm tired of grumpy
virgins."

 Chris Stroffolino--
 I'm not sure I understand your definition of "metroplex", because, for me
 the metroplex remains synonymous with the "mall" or downtown movie theaters
 that used to have one huge screen and now have 8 miniature screens. However
 i do sense that you mean "mega-urban" area when you say "metroplex". And,
 maybe you could clarify your reason for stating that _poets_ have shifted
 away from these areas. Also, why do you state "there's hardly viable
 academic institutions there" (meaning urban areas)? Of course, your points
 interest me and i'd just like to uncover the specifics of "why".

Ken Sherwood cited most of the stuff I would have used to argue for LZ as
a New York poet; maybe the poetics themselves could have come out of
_any_ environment (tho I bet that can be argued too--imagine Wordsworth's
"fittings" coming out of 18th century London, if you can), but the poems
are surely urban.

Thanks to everyone for the info on CD-ROM poetry (I'm the one who
originally asked for it). In addition to getting our library to purchase
them, I'm now thinking of making a new one that would record the readings
to take place at an international conference/festival I'm hosting at UNH next
August. (More info on that event to follow in about a week or so. Ken Edwards
posted a message for me about it last month when I was moving back to the
States; plans are right now shifting and changing a bit because of the
axe on NEH and other kinds of funding I'd applied for.) If anyone has
ideas about what I might try to do (that's new) with such a recording, let
me know.
 
I also need Steve McCaffery's new address if anyone has it (probably best
to e-mail it directly to me at the address above).  Thanks.

  Ron S:  Point well taken--Yes, there wasn't much academic affiliation
          back in the good old days--and perhaps the reason so many of
          my generation have gone "back to school" (if belatedly) may
          reflect a larger social/economic question that i wanted to raise
          as well as "a genuine urge to learn"...
          But the OTHER point I raised I think should be considered too--
          There has been a noticeable decentralization it seems and aside
          from the lack of good bookstores in major cities (or just about
          anywhere) the idea of vital poetry communities as in say roughly
          1953-1977 (I say roughly) in major cities has also been a source
          of frustration for many and I think is related to the skyrocketing
          rents that perhaps were systematically designed to divide the
          potentially "countercultural" forces from each other, etc. etc--
          Since I am contemplating moving back to a large city
          (perhaps Philadelphia again, but wherever...) I certainly would
          like to see this change. But it seems more possible in places
          where the rents are a little cheaper and people are not so pressured
          by having to work 60 hours a week to pay for a phone-booth shaped
          (and sized) apartment--with little time for writing much less a
          "scene" that includes musicians and painters etc etc as much as
          poets.....chris

PLEASE RE-POST
Postmodern Culture -- Call for Work in Hypermedia
 
With the recent surge of interest in the World Wide Web and other
distributed information systems, hypermedia projects are becoming both more
numerous and more sophisticated.  Postmodern Culture will continue to
publish important offerings in hypertext and hypermedia, presenting works
that extend and redefine electronic expression.  At this point we would
especially like to see conceptually challenging projects: texts that are
genuinely multiple and whose multiplicity of discourse constitutes more
than an auxiliary for traditional language and forms.  We welcome both
aesthetic and discursive approaches.  This call goes out to philosophers,
historians, ethnographers as well as artists of word and image.
 
Projects in HTML and other Web environments are preferable but we will
consider other media as appropriate.  Submissions must not have been
featured in other electronic publications and should have had minimal
exposure to date.  Copyright if any must be held by the author(s).  To
offer your work for consideration, please send a letter or e-mail
containing a brief description of your project.  Please include a URL if
your text is accessible through the World Wide Web.

Subject:      Re: BAAAAAAD villanelle!
 
I would like to propose a sense of appropriation, no, taking back, that can
be found in Lisa Robertson's X'eclogue. That is, that it is not the
baaaaaad referent (form o form) thing - which to me speaks of a haven of
rhetoric - but it is language taken back from the proto-historical edifice
- proved surgent, insurgent in the capacity of the pastoral to re-mean, to
be a new language, a new history -- that means to de-edify. I still don't
see, though I've seen the Bernstein, Berrigan, Bernadette de-formation and
re-inrichment of trope/idiom, how language emerges new in the face of a
villanelle. And granted, the eclogue is the echo there in the X, and the
Virgilian edifice of state is ripe there. But Robertson, it seems to me
(and please Lisa correct me if I flail) deftly sidesteps on purpose the
trap of the rhetorical in order to flood the past historical male situation
of the pastoral with the clear-eyed availability of language to the
feminist/vocal present. This appears a clear attempt to re-invigorate, to
take language, to speak. Conversely, it appears conversations on the
viability of the villanelle center on how we can re-form. The rhetorical
Issue (as in birth) of the villanelle is ripe, but compared to taking back
language heretofore unavailable, it is still.

Mark --
 
Wish I could be there for all those readings -- a year in L.A. doesn't
turn up as much of interest as that listing --
 
Sounds from your post and Mr. Smith's that you just had the same
discussion I had over a beer fifteen years ago after another D.C. reading
-- What's of interest, to me, is a poem that takes the ideological
history of its own form as part of its formal workings -- a formal
working like the semantic grinding Williams did on the word "rose" --
stripping off its old connotations so that it can be used to mean that
(like "love") again -- never boring, no matter what you might hear --
 
Poems in "new" forms that do not take into consideration their own
placement in the language and/of politics are, again to me, just as
boring and reactionary as last week's workshop sestina --
 
But, it's hard to do -- Take the form of the drunken poets' post-reading
contention -- hard to make it do something new, but it can be done --
 
A group of us solved the form/content problem once and for all back in
1989, but since we were drinking too much (at the Hawk & Dove, of all
places), none of us could ever remember the solution afterward --
 
on the other hand, they may have just discovered a planet outside our
solar system --
 
Any form can instigate new modes of thought and of being in the world --
most forms most of the time do not --
 
Say hello to Rosmarie Waldrop for me when she gets there -- We had a
little party for her years ago when she read at WPA, but I haven't had a
chance to see her since --

Mark too -- take a look at Derrida's _The Ear of the Other_, where he
takes up exactly that question, using the example of Nietzche -- It's not
sufficient, he says, to say simply that the Nazis misread Nietzche, or
that Nietzche is implicitly a Nazi  (this should remind you of some
recent arguments about the supposed totalitarian nature of modernist
form) -- we must produce readings that account for the means by which
those interpretations were produced --  It's important to read the
American academic appropriations of poststructuralist thought fully, not
just to dismiss them --

an all around terrific post.  more later I hope, but meanwhile appreciation
for the remarks on form and/as/or (its) politics, ditto the effect(s) of theory.
 
I've gone backchannel w Chris S re Dickinson and rhyme, but I can't see how
Ashbery's, or Auden's for that matter, weird sestinas and ballads and so on
CAN'T be "for use" (cits) & etc.  Ditto, to revive an old though brief

right.  I remember some non-poet friends telling me the thing to do was to
figure out what couldn't be done, spozedly, in poetry today, and then set
about doing it.  I settled on comissioned occasional poems (though Ashbery
actually wrote a couple), thinking of Upon Appleton House etc., but have not
yet (this was a decade or more ago) actually taken up the challenge.  But I
still like the idea.  And the idea I guess would be to be not TOO
obviously/grotesquely parodic (though shodding a head in a canoe wd be ok....)

To:  Richard Caddel . . .What does "unblinkered" mean, in one's reading of
the "place" where LN lived?
 
Please explain.  Also, "unsupportable," "failing," "failure," "unwittingly."
 
It's like we are all bozoes except for you and your proposed sympathetic,
unblinking reading of the place.
 
Think of us instead as little children, who aren't old enough to understand
everything in the adult world, who indeed find pity in everything, but who
have generous and loving hearts nevertheless and who are easily hurt and
shocked by the cold adult eye.
 
Think of us reading LN and finding plenty of evidence that indeed she felt
cramped, stifled, overworked, and marginalised by her position in society
and in fact on the map of the US, evidence that supports a blinkered
reading.
 
Please don't feel that American readers of LN are clowns who only prefer
our own bourgeois lives to the life she led because we are selfish tourist
type people.  You know, Richard Caddel, that we are all tourists whirling
around from place to place, even if we never leave our own little villages.
The world still comes in through every crevice in our playrooms and leaves
an inevitable residue of hurt and pain.  When I read LN I find that the
suffering and abjection so marvelously proposed, crystallized, redacted in
her work is what holds me closest to it, not her solidarity with fellow
citizens of whatever the town is where she was and how she was concerned
about them.  We do not think of her as "mute", on the contrary, she is
still speaking in a way.  Still her status as a poet not widely known in
her own lifetime, in fact not so well read today, is kind of like a creepy
experience of feeling the other, a shadow self, the uncanny.
 
Think of us as willing her into our own lives in whatever shape we can, and
yet knowing that she of course has no knowledge of us, she in that regard
is the blind blank uncomprehending blinkerered sphinx we try to read.
Thanks for listening!  Yours-Kevin Killian

I forget whether it is Houston or Dallas that refers to its larger
metropolitan area as the Metroplex, but I was basically punning off of
that and the idea of complex (as in "he has a complex").
 
Rents and the other difficulties of major urban areas are indeed an
issue. As late as 1978, I had one seventh of a seven bedroom "mansion"
on California Street (baja Pacific Heights) in SF for a vast sum of $50
per month. I pay 20 times that amount now.
 
There are also issues, such as, the distractions of certain areas (the
way poets in LA get sucked into the film industry or the way they used
to get sucked into the art gallery/critique world in NYC when there was
still some capital there). In SF, poetry was "always" (from 1955
forward anyway) one of the "major" art forms of the area and didn't
have to compete with the fine arts scene etc for print space. In other
cities, one of the major questions is how to have a serious discussion
about the poetry one loves when there are only a handful of other folks
in the city who will know what the heck you are talking about.
Occasionally, enough people come together to make something real
congeal, as has happened at times in the DC area, and in San Diego and
I presume must be happening now in Detroit.
 
The decentralization of the avant-garde is a profoundly important (and
good) thing. There will be much greater variation in the long run,
tendencies will cohere and create new things, with a broader range to
view and choose from, than if it retains the old two or three major
urban area focus.
 
In Russia, of course, there's the same competitive feel between Moscow
and St. Petersburg as there ever was betwixt SF & NYC (as in "Oh,
Arkadii's a Moscow poet stuck in St Pete"), with the ancillary
assumption that nothing much is happening in Vladivostok (I actually
heard a writer from there give a great talk on Borges once).

  Dear Ron--this should almost be a backchannel question. But I will ask
  it anyway (in the spirit of the discussion on Minneapolis a few months
  back): Why do you think Philadelphia has not been able to produce a kind
  of self-reproducing scene that has sustained itself as much as say Washington
  DC? It's a much bigger city and has some resources that could definitely
  be tapped. I know you are new there--but when i was there I was able to
  bring certain poets who suprisingly would not have come otherwise to
  a downtown art gallery for VERY LITTLE MONEY. I felt bad about the
  sums I paid out, and even worse in some ways that I had to almost pull
  teeth to draw audiences for Carla Harryman, David Shapiro, Leslie
  Scalapino, Alice Notley, Alan Davies for instance as well as Bob Perelman
  (who at that time had just moved to Phila.)--(to name some of just the
  most famous--I'd have to list too many other names however to stave off
  potential charges of being a "starfucker"). Anyway, TEMPLE does do better
  in terms of bringing poets in than many institutions of similar size
  (say, SUNY ALBANY) and there has been The Painted Bride there as well
  at least enough magazines for someone to "get started" (Phila. was
  definitely MY springboard in that sense). And now perhaps Perelman will
  have more power at penn---when I was there he didn't have much--taught
  no grad classes, etc. Now I hear they are letting him bring poets in.
  to read in the series. Yet though there are magazines and series, there
  are not book publishers or even chapbooks. Nor is there much of a
  salient community---It's like every time something gets started, someone
  moves to japan or albany, etc. Again, the nomadism that careerism
  entails etc that many married friends of mine have had to negotiate in
  thorny ways (though it effects us all, and to add insult to industry
  their ideological justifiers speak of "family" and "hometown" values---
  oops, sorry, digression)--Anyway, I am definitely PLUGGING Philadelphia
  despite the seeming negativity. It is afterall by far the cheapest big
  east coast city (Albany and even providence has rents about as hi and
  albany, at least, unlike Phila. is not a WALKING CITY). Perhaps the
  proximity of NYC effects it. Effects it negatively. But it COULD affect
  PHILA. positively (aside from the poets I had read that wanted to
  VISIT BOB or GIL OTT anyway, I probably could not have gotten as many
  to read there for the price I paid had it not been for NYC proximity)...
  Anyway it seems that a more livable and viable scene could exist there
  than exists in NYC (the problems at St. Marx; the recent inbreeding at

Subject:      Villanelle
 
I have heard of poetry-writing workshops in which students were
required to write a villanelle, as if to do so were some sort of
necessary basic training. The Army used to require recruits to
"duck-walk" great distances; then it turned out that this ruins
people's knees.
 
All those complex forms originated in Romance languages at the time
(1300-1550) when poetry was separating itself from music. The two
art forms became too complex to work together, as they had previously
in Church music and in troubadour songs. Because there are many more
rhyme possibilities in these languages than in English, they were not
all that hard to use, but nevertheless were highly artificial (in
both good and bad senses).
 
Then the French revived them in the nineteenth century, as a form of
Romantic medievalizing, somewhat as English poets revived ballads and
folk songs. Then English poets (Dobson, Wilde, Swinburne) imitated
what the French were doing. The oddest thing is that in America
certain formalist poet/critics have latched onto these
Romantic-revival forms as if they were traditional and "classical."
Actually the best villanelles have been written by romantics like
Dylan Thomas and Roethke.
 
My own feeling is that there are probably enough villanelles in the
world to satisfy pent-up villanelle demand. The experimental
formalism of May Swenson is much more exciting. But because you
really have to work to see what she is up to--even when the poems are
easy to read for other reasons--she attracts little attention. She's
not even in the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry. But that's OK.
Just look at some of the anthologies published around 1910; along
with a few reconizable names are scores of "important" figures long
since consigned to oblivion.

Mark,
 
I agree with you on the issue of prescribed form and its usefulness.
As for the villanelle, David Shapiro offers some interesting renovations.
I have been interested in villanelles for some time now,
and so I offer the following poem (from the previous summer) as a token
of our shared interest:
 
No Oasis
 
Where God is absent, creation can begin.
Now, before the silence of what's next,
the author disappears and starts again.
 
At any point upon the track, a thin
light leaks through cracks left in a text.
Where God is absent, creation can begin
 
to blend and clash. The spirit is to win
as _air_ defeats _the air_. Without context
the author disappears and starts again
 
to build a world, a golden weheel to spin
it on--and all its method circumspect.
Where God is absent, creation can begin;
 
it leaps into a distance without end
where land moves always as the wind directs
the author disappears and starts again
 
to ask a question of the shadow in
each word which echoes in the clamor of a next
where God is absent. Creation can begin
to disappear. The author starts again.
 
Jabesian influence, of course.  Speaking of Jabes, I am reminded that in
_The Book of Questions_ he writes,
 
"Who am I," I asked.
"Who am I," I replied.
Repetition is an achievement in its difference.
 
It seems to me that this passage speaks to the possible discoveries
offered by prescribed forms, especially in the area of duration.  I'm
also thinking of Ashbery and the use of "fixed" forms as generative device.
 
Have a student here to see me.
 
Best,
 
Josh

Subject:      Hypertext & Poetry Possibilities
 
It's a bit difficult to respond to the postings on possibilities of hypertext
for poetry without sounding blatantly self-promotional, since that's what
I've been doing for about the last 8 years or so.  All of my work runs only
on the Mac at present, alas -- I'm hoping one of the promised tools for
getting Hypercard stacks to run under Windows will materialize before I spend
the work to port my stacks by hand into something like ToolBook.  I have some
snippets on my Web site, but they don't really convey what the actual work
feels like.
 
The thing that has excited me is the possibilities hypertext methods allow
for word *structure*.  Since my undergraduate days one of the things I've
wanted to do with words is put them (literally) on top of one another.
Painters juxtapose, composers put sounds on top of one another, there's no
reason poets shouldn't do the same.  But there's a problem:  when you put
words literally on top of one another, they tend to *interfere* to the point
of unintelligibility -- regardless of whether you do it orally using
simultaneous voices, or visually on the page.  Interactive software methods
allow you to put words on top of one another and *sacrifice nothing* in the
way of intelligibility:  using the mouse one can navigate the layers and read
all the words, yet those words reside in the same place.
 
Of course, to state the obvious:  hypertext allows words to be brought
together with *inherently* non-linear structure; what interests me about
hypertext is not so much using hypertext to assemble linear documents but
rather a poetry written directly in a non-linear structure.  The
possibilities truly are endless.
 
The word processor has arguably done a lot of damage to the cause of poetry;
by making it so easy to enter words into the computer, the word processor
disguises the fact that it is just as constraining as the typewriter.
Graphics programs let the words be placed anywhere in the graphical space,
and in that regard are much better, but best of all is completely interactive
software like ToolBook or Hypercard.
 
I don't want to start a religious war but I have a lot of mixed feelings
about HTML.  The Web is *wonderful* as a community medium, but at the moment
HTML provides virtually *nothing* in the way of artistic control over
interface behavior.  Java has a lot of promise as an interactive medium, but
with (at the moment) a very steep learning curve.  [Java is a programming
language for Web applications created by Sun Microsystems, and Netscape is
supporting it in their Web browsers.]  What we really need is a cross-
platform Hypercard-like front end to create Java applications.  (Stay tuned,
this will surely emerge.)
 
There is a whole Net community of hypertext writers and literary types, and
we badly need more good writers.  Here's hoping members of this list *do*
take up hypertext!

Thanks for bringing this up. The problems in NY have made it just about
unliveable (for the last hundred years) and the problems in the community
are as severe as they can get. However, all these good poets have moved
to NY lately. Much more _hope_ for an intelligent and friendly scene than
there was five years ago, and the frequently-commented on EAR trouble is
just a growing pang of the coalescing group, if you ask. St Marks, well,
it's a nice gig... anybody see Ed Friedman's _Mao & Matisse_? And as for
the "factions" well nobody says you have to like everybody's poetry.. and
what factions anyway? EAR/post St.marks/nuyo? perf/visual/lang? David
Cameron/Douglas Rothschild/India Hixon? There's a little _horror vacui_
people get looking at NY from the periphery. And then there's the total
hostility everyone embodies as soon as they arrive. NY would be richer
for your presence Chris (probably). Which usually means hey we're gonna
bleed you dry...

well permit me to be a bit promotional FOR jim (rosenberg):  if part of
what poets do is to explore and construct new forms, why then why not do
so?... at the risk of preaching to the choir (and why i feel i must is a
thing worth considering), we should all, to the extent we have access to
same, at least be willing to look with an informed eye at what's going down
in the electronic world---cd rom, hypertext, html, what have you...
 
there are poets who still rage against the benefits of *this* medium, and
perhaps it wasn't that long ago that some of us might have been a part of
that resistance...
 
jim's own work, *intergrams* (eastgate quarterly review of hypertext volume
1, number 1) is most definitely worth checking out, as are (what i like to
call) his liner notes, "openings:  the connection direct, personal notes on
poetics"... i found his re/dematerializing of text on the screen just
fascinating... though i prefer the term multilinear to non-linear, in any
case the work, as jim indicates, opens new structural possibilities...
 
i'd like mself to see more active interrogation of such work by folks on
this list...
 
and of course i include mself in all we's & us's employed herein...

I might argue that it's impossible NOT to take form in this way, but that it
is just as valuable, and perhaps more, if the consideration of the
ideological history, or other formal imperatives, are implicit rather than
explicit.

Perhaps you do mean that one has to acknowledge such placement, rather than
simply use it, which I would contest.

This seems to me best done in print by layering of papers, including
transparent or translucent ones. While it can probably be done with less
expense with interactive software methods, there is something else with
words on paper, which is the physical fact of language as tangible
substance. I remain attracted to that, although not to the extent of being a
luddite about other possibilities. Still, I think when one presents what
hypertext and computer renditions can do with the visual/structural
presentation of language, I think one needs to understand that all such
possibilities at this time are innovative and highly experimental.
Therefore, it may make more sense to contrast them not with standard
printing/binding/book practices, but with innovative and experimental
possibilities in such media.

Dear Dodie,
 
I know you're only kidding when you spell my name "Cadel". The write-down
Niedecker movement has been big in its time, and has always included US
and UK men and women who should've known better (and her supporters and
publishers were also on occasions aghast at the circumstances of her
life). Davie, I guess, was in the praise-with-faint-damns end of things,
along with those who called her work "delicate" or "slight" or even
"wispy" - but he wasn't alone. Hopefully that school's on the decline and
more accurate readings are on the increase - and perhaps when there's a
good edition of her work available, the Niedecker Vigilantes can stand
down.
 
But because there IS still a current of "My God! How could anyone actually
LIVE there?" - and because your slightly-parodied-revisioning was so
complete, I'm afraid I linked your "sad little shack" and "poorness of the
lives" (which are pretty disparaging phrases - this side of the Atlantic)
to the more general malaise: hence the generalisation of my address. Sorry
- but pleased to know the linkage was misplaced.
 
I've just got no idea how sad your dad's tool shed is. My dad's shed needs
painting, but seems quite emotionally stable. Our own shed collapsed last
week - couldn't take the strain...

charles, i agree with you about contrasting hypermedia etc. with innovative
print practices---insofar as more formal considerations go... but part of
what's at stake here is a matter of the publishing/distribution networks
both of print work, innovative and otherwise, as well as electronic form...
 
by which i mean simply to say that there are publishing/distribution
networks out there that define themselves in terms of practices that are
stubbornly resistant to the formal innovations you or i may have in mind...
and that the emergence of electronic form augurs (potentially now) a sea
change simply because these selfsame print 'communities,' albeit resistant
to print innovation per se, are now finding themselves incapable of
resisting electronic 'intrusion' of one sort or another...
 
pardon my momentary evangelicalism, and not to 'bypass' any particular
genre or form or press... but methinks there is much that can and should
happen in more staid academic circles re innovation, and that the work
coming out of same profits from "comparison" both with more innovative
print work as well as emerging electronic form...
 
all best////

Tom Beard posted about his stuff a while ago, particularly "27" and I'll
jsut add that i thought it was great.  as i recall his page had some links
to various other cumminglings of on-line hypertext stuff, probably a VERY
useful place to start...
 
"27" is at http://metcon.met.co.nz/nwfc/beard/www/notes27.html#readings
 
his library is at http://metcon.met.co.nz/nwfc/beard/www/library.html
 
there's probably links to at least two dozen on-line journals and other
publications, many of which are good *hypertext* as opposed to good html.
(i make the distinction between hypertext and html, many people don't.
when i type hypertext, i'm talking about the content, html is the code
implementing that content)
 
at any rate, Jim Rosenberg's stuff, along with Tom Beard's stuff make for a
good primer of sorts....

Subject:      Terry Riley/Olson
 
Like Herb Levy, I was intrigued by the forthcoming performance at the
Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival of Terry Riley's Olson III - not least
because I'm supposed to be performing in it! In one of my other lifetimes I work
with a group called Contemporary Music Making for Amateurs, which will be
performing the piece on 18 November.
 
So far I the only information I have is that it is a piece for chorus (not
necessarily trained voices) and was written as a companion to In C, but has only
been performed once before (presumably in the 1960s, when it was written). I
hope to find out more in the next few days - including whether there is a
connection with Charles Olson - and will report back.

Open letter to Mark Wallace
 
Of course you already know the answer to your question, that
of course no FORMS in themselves are BAD.  What you really
want to know is why self-defined 'experimentalists' react
so badly towards the notion of writing within 'traditional
forms.'
 
Here are two possible reasons:
(1) In these Post-Projective-Verse times (and, really Mark,
this is the only 'post' I'm going to admit) the interest in
open field leads to a prejudice towards open form.  As in:
Free Love Free Mandela Free Verse!
 
We know that the same 'presentational' possibility (poem as act
of instant rather than twice removed thought about) can be
achieved in sonnet, but we imagine many of those sonneteers are making
themselves after a different image (hold a mirror up to nature).
 
Reason (2) is frank annoyance on part of self-proclaimed experimentalists
at the ease with which sonneteers and their peers proceed in
poetizing their prose with the filigree markers of 'traditional
poetry.'
 
Neither position defensible, exactly--the latter particularly,
recalls Wystan's point that, on some level, the self-marginalizing
expermentalists really just want to be loved as much as Amy Clampitt
or Donald Hall.
 
Hugs,
Ken
(p.s. I feel more victimized by the Possum's Sonnets than by
High Theory)

Philadelphia, hmmm? After 5 months, I have been to exactly two
readings, one of which I was part of. I'm aware of a third (in Camden
actually) that I would have liked to have gotten to. But it does seem
to be a pretty quiet scene. Although there are some very fine poets
here whose work should be more broadly known--Julia Blumenreich,
Phyllis Wat, Eli Goldblatt, Heather Thomas, Alicia Askenase, Gil Ott,
for example--I think that the "pull" of NYC on a younger poet must be
pretty strong. One has to look at who lives here and why. Bob Perelman,
Toby Olson, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, and Goldblatt, for example, all have
teaching jobs that have brought or kept them here. Ott was a local who
returned from San Francisco (Bolinas, really) after health problems
required him to spend some time back at his parents, got involved in
the Painted Bride (which just laid him off after 15 years of service in
a downsizing effort that seems spectacularly dunder-headed) and
developed that entire scene. I first met Blumenreich when she was a
student, another local person. She stayed and married Gil, but seems to
be the sort of person who under other circumstances would have
seriously thought of moving somewhere that provided better access to a
larger scene. I've met exactly one "student poet," Joshua Schuster. In
all, what I have at this point are impressions. I must say that the
reading Rae Armantrout gave at Penn was well attended, although almost
exclusively by students and faculty at that school. When I read at
Temple in early '94, I similarly got a great audience, which was doubly
amazing since it was on short notice, my first attempt having been
thwarted when the school (and city) shut down due to an ice storm. They
don't deal with winter as easily as the folks in Buffalo, I must say.
 
I must say, though, that Philly is a very pleasant, interesting, varied
city, and the countryside to the west (where I am) is spectacularly
beautiful. I miss people and some bookstores from the Bay Area (notably
SPD) but otherwise, I'm happy as a clam.
 
Other cities on the East Coast surprise me more than Philadelphia. For
example, Boston has been by far the least hospitable city for the
post-New American poetries of any large scene imaginable. Last time I
checked, Charles Bernstein and I had each given exactly one reading
there (mine was in Bill Corbett's house), compared to the three I've
given in Philadelphia, the two in DC, etc. Baltimore is another city
that has several writers, but seems very quiet. Rod Smith and Mark
Wallace seem determined to make DC interesting (and appear to be doing
a very good job thereof). But Wilmington? Why have I never met a poet
who lived in Wilmington?

Dear Kevin - and anyone else who I've unwittingly offended -
 
I'm a bit worried about the "think of us" routine, since it suggests that
I've tried to put down all American LN readers/readings in one bag. I
haven't. I'm also concerned that a note of UK/US divisiveness creeps in
at this point, which again, isn't supported by anything I've written. I
don't think it's so simple as to say, UK sees it thus; US sees it thus,
nor have I ever tried to imply that. Nor, I'm afraid, did I ever get
round to proposing "my" reading of the place: what I did comment on, in
fact, was how difficult a good take on the place would be.
 
"Unblinkered" to me would mean a reading which didn't just propose one
take on the place (as in: the poverty! the saddness! let's move to NY)
but tried to see what more there is to it than that (blinkers, you know,
are what people put on horses to make them look in one direction).
Nothing's ever comprehensive, of course, but when we've totted up the
pain & suffering in LN's work, we recognise that there's more to it than
that: an affirmation, even a celebration. That needs to be said. So, a
reading of the place which doesn't say that risks being considered
"unsupportable", "failing" etc. "Unwitting" acknowledges that perhaps
that's not deliberate, as in the heading of this posting.
 
Yes, we're all tourists, zipping around and taking snapshots. But those
snapshots can be misleading (a) about the snappee, and (b) about the
snapper. John Barrell made this point, writing about Clare, who so
singularly wrote out of one place, even after it had gone forever, and who
was constantly faced with incomprehension over his concerns to celebrate
social and physical environment, at whatever price. Hence my Clare/
Niedecker comparison. Snapshots don't carry enough depth for complex
subjects.
 
I'm going to be off-list for a few days, and would like not to leave bad
feeling behind me - so - Sorry to Dodie and Kevin and anyone else,
whereever they may be, if anything I've said offended. I hope I've
cleared it up.

Well, just to start with, one that I think of as an Old Favorite,
"Cat and the Weather."
 
When you first read this you think you have a latter-day imagist
poem, and in fact it has a lot in common with peoms by Amy Lowell and
especially H. D. That is, you see that cat on that windowsill with
that snow coming down on that particular day in that particular
place, and the lines of the poem seem broken so as to intensify the
focus. And visual focus is extremely important in her poems. I "saw"
the Piazza San Marco more vividly in one of her poems than I can see
it while standing there, overhwelmed with pigeons and architectural
detail.
 
But then if you _listen_ to her poems you usually hear the complex
audible structure. It varies from poem to poem but it IS
structure--not just the random jotting that it looks like at first.
 
The three poems in The Harper Anthology of Poetry make a good
beginning.
 
Maybe when I have time I can key in some poems. _Half Sun Half Sleep_
is a fine volume. _To Merge With Time_ included a broad sweep of her
work.
 
She did at one point get a little too caught up in concrete or shaped
poems, but even there it's usually   more than just typing out the
words so they look like a swan--as Hollander did. I mean, if you
study the shape you see there's more to it than it seems at first. In
"How Eeverything Happens: A Study of the Wave" at first you think,
well, OK, it's like a wave. Then you see that implied in the poem are
everything from quantum theory to emotional cycles.
 
But you have to take time to get to know the poems. It's not
performance poetry or experiential onrush. There's movement but there
is also a lot of stasis. I can imagine getting some pleasure out of
riding past a long series of Pollock paintings on a motorbike, but I
can't imagine doing a Monet show that way.
 
To some extent her strategies were a way of achieving this focus or
stasis--they slowed her down. But I never feel that the poems are
over-articulated or too gimmicky, because in the end the focus is
outside herself even when it's inside herself (I mean, as when she
writes about the effect of novocaine after a dentist visit).

Subject:      Villon's Snow (still falling)
 
The difficulty I'm having with the discussion of theory and form is the
apparent assumption that they are isolable. In this model (as with the recent
poetry and politics discussion - "politics is only one possible hobby amongst
many") it seems as though theory is being treated as a kind of fetishized
content to sprinkle over and enliven otherwise mundane and static forms. But
- following up on Charles Alexander's post - I can't now finish a poem that
doesn't take up "the ideological history of its own form as part of its
formal workings." And ideological future for that matter, although I wouldn't
insist that it be "implicit rather than explicit," since, as with Zizek,
there is no dirty little secret, no missing X of reality that the ideological
veils. In this concern, at least, ideology IS the real. The state IS because
it is a form of life (in Wittgenstein's term). And if the tent poles change,
so does the tent. That fact doesn't make me forget the other fact of their
contradictory status (as alienated forms). As Ron implied some time ago (or
should have), it is precisely their material contradictions that make poems
important. To paraphrase: "It is because they are contradictory that they
must be written." But the other side of this, which Rod Smith pointed out in
his post, is the critical and participatory moment, the feedback through
method or ascesis. For example, in the last few days, I followed this chain:
Ed Foster (concerning Dickinson's dashes) remarked upon the fallen status of
the dash (as now designating the merely parenthetical, a paradigmatic
parallel or restatement). It occurs to me then that Dickinson's dashes aren't
noemic at all, but distributional (as opposed to integrative, in Culler's
terms). This sent me back to my notes from Culler where I found my own early
mis-reading of Bruce Andrews as "about" paradigm, whereas now, in light of
the Kula gift ring shard posted by cris cheek, I might read Bruce as
distributional, the accrual of significations (to the artifact and not the
artificer) in the "progress" from island to island in Bruce's projected
oceanic paradise of language, which accrual, because of the feedback, forces
lexical change both in the artifact and reading. The idea that signification
ACCRUES through circulation has implications for form. Form may initiate
circulation, but circulation ensures a surplus, an eventual excess meaning.
And as that pressure builds, the lexical shift must occur. Among other
changes, it can be a shift in the way signification is distributed among the
iconic counters, which again, I assume, can cause shifts in the directions
and kinds of their literal mobility, their use. So, yes, a text can be VERY
responsible for what can be done with it. An author may not be. For as Sweet
William also said, "Uh-oh, somebody's been fuckin' with my mummy again."

Subject:      Re: Hypertext & Poetry Possibilities
 
Thanks one and all for the many kind words.  While we're handing out
recommendations, I'd like to speak for John Cayley's work, which I find
simply stunning.  John does a very different kind of work than I do, using
algorithms to generate text on-the-fly from things in the poem that have
already happened.  He's also doing some really provocative things with time,
with having words appear in different places on the screen at the same time.
 
Charles Alexander:

Interesting you should mention this -- I support the idea of using physical
media 100%.  One thing I think I would do if I were teaching a course in
hypertext writing is to give one assignment to make a hypertext without using
the computer at all.  As attractive as the computer is in many respects, it
is also easy to get sidetracked by whatever off-the-shelf abstractions the
particular software package you're using has built in, rather than focusing
on exactly what you want to accomplish aesthetically.  Physical media let you
execute ideas more directly.  Struggling with physical media is a good
way to become clear on what you want to do when you do sit down with software.
 
I was fascinated to learn from Cathy Marshall, who is one of the leading
hypertext researchers (and whose ideas parallel mine in a lot of truly
uncanny ways) that she got started in hypertext using physical models --
pasting words onto the kind of chemical models used to display the structure
of molecules.
 
Word installations is another area where there is a whole infinitude of
possibilities to be explored.  The page can be literally any possible space.
I have a lot of nostalgia for the two installations I did back in the 70s.
 
One thing the computer does bring to the table is that it makes it very easy
to reproduce the work once you're done.  Using (say) transparent plastic
sheets is a lot easier to do in an original one-off work than in an edition.
The computer also brings some difficult *problems* to the table.  Given the
rapid pace of change in the computer industry, how easy will it be to find
a computer 50 years from now that can run today's computer poetry?  Whose
burden is it to be sure there's a way to display the work?  A lot of questions
to be answered.

It's always nice to see Providence become invisible once again. We have
only the likes of Keith & Rosmarie Waldrop, C.D. Wright & Forrest Gander,
Ray Ragosta, Craig Watson (when he's not in China, Australia, South
Africa or Malaysia), Tom Ahern, Mark McMorris, Jennifer Moxley, Patrick

& Mutlu Blasing, Nancy Donegan, Jan Cal, Xue Di, Meng Lang, Catherine
Imbriglio [with recent leavings including Lee Ann Brown, Peter Gizzi,
LeAnn Jacobs & Elizabeth Willis] among the non-student poetry community;
with fiction writers Robert Coover, Carole Maso, Robert Arellano, Lori Baker,
Gita Brown, Alison Bundy, Donald Judson, Meredith Steinbach, Shay Youngblood
comprising a corner of the prose writers in town (not to mention playwrights
Eliza Anderson, Debbie Baley, Aishah Rahman, Paula Vogel, Adam Bock, etc.) --
and an ever-changing group of dynamic graduate _and_ undergraduate poets,
fiction writers, etc (one recent graduate, Aaron Kunin, is now at Duke
pursuing a PhD -- his honors thesis was a tremendous, intelligent piece
of writing).
 
Excuse the plug for the home ground, Ron. It may not be Paradise, but it _is_
where _Paradise_ was lovingly published.
 
Cheers,

Yes, Jim's fine, pioneering work, including his notes and essays on
non/multi-linear poetics, are a necessary reference here.
 
I've also been working, on and off, in this area since the personal
computer first became available, and my web-site (see below) has some
explanatory material. To self-promote, I now have now several
self-published Macintosh disks which make non-trivial use of the medium of
a computer-based cybertext systems to present poetic work.
 
There is a *lot* that can be done. But poets/writers will have to come to
grips with software, to 'press the reveal code key' as I would have it
[quoting something that has been written to, hopefully, appear elsewhere]:
'Each term of the writer/reader/programmer triangle is a shifter. Just as
writer may be reader and reader, writer in current (post-modern) critical
perspectives, so either of these absent agents may be programmers:
systematic manipulators of text and intertext, making use of software which
has become intimate with poetics. Poets and readers must become intimate
with software. They must press the "Reveal Code" key.'
 
For (an obvious) example: 'Scoring' a (silent) reading so that words,
phrases etc. appear on the screen in positions composed/specified by an
author, and at speeds and with pauses which are as she hears them with her
inner ear -- this is something that is fairly easy to set up on modern
computer systems. I made a software harness for HyperCard on the Mac which
allows you take a text, arrange the words on the screen(s), set speeds at
which they appear (rightwards-scrollingly), set pauses between words /
phrases/ lines / screens; set multiple orders in which the words appear,
and are erased, etc. etc. This system is a usable but unfinished piece of
software (unfinished -- as a software publication *tool*, tho' separate
pieces using it exist, especially _wine flying_ (1988)
<http://www.inforamp.net/~cayley/wshome.html#KINETIC> -- because I quickly
became more interested in quasi-aleatory text generation). But if it was
ever finished, it could be used to 'publish' anyone's work; anyone who
wanted to score a series of silent readings of appropriate pieces in this
way. [If some institution give me a grant to finish the software, ho ho,
and someone was willing to help edit an anthology of scored pieces by
innovative poets -- well, there aren't too many projects I'd rather
undertake.]
 
Charles B. said we should announce new 'books', so apologies for continuing
with this shameless self-promotion. My latest is:
 
_The Speaking Clock_
 
... with acknowledgements to Emmett Williams's 'Poetry Clock' and, more
specifically, to John Christie's mechanical 'Word Clocks' ... however this
(silent) speaking clock in software both composes from a given text
according to quasi-aleatory procedures and actually tells the 'real time':
 
"What if it was impossible to apply a single name from a finite set to a
moment which seems to recur in an acknowledged cycle of time? What if it
was impossible to apply the word 'dawn' to more than one single instant at
the beginning of some one particular day?" -- from the given text.

Well, I suppose this the perfect opportunity to plug the reading series I
and Eric Malone are starting in Boston.  "CellarDoor" will give poets a
place to read outside the university scene that's stuffed into every corner
of this city (please pay no attention to my Harvard email address;
I only work here like many other Somervillites).  Our first reader is
Bill Corbett (speaking of Bill...) on OCTOBER 29, 2:00, at the Bookcellar
Cafe, 1971 Mass. Ave, Cambridge.
 
Ron, have you heard of Word of Mouth, the Boston series run by
Michael Franco for the past 8 years, in which Robin Blaser, Kevin Killian,
Dodie Bellamy, Anne Waldman, Ed Foster and many others read?  Word of
Mouth has ended (at least for a while) so Eric and I started CellarDoor
to fill the void.
 
Poets on this list, if you ever come to Boston, please let me know
so we can arrange to give you a reading!!  Email me or write me at 51
Laurel St. #3, Somerville MA 02143.

  Poetics list,  I was wondering if there were any poets/writers/creators/
     thinkers/ or _pockets_ of poets who are currently working in the
      medium of _chance_ (operations, etc.)--aside from those relatively
          established already. S
                                  pecifically, i'm interested in
         researching these things as it relates to current technolgies-
  the _place_ or position of poetries/art w/in the technically emergent
 world/locus. Even more to the point, is there anyone out there who
 is currently _performing_ aleatory-poetics, etc., aside from figures
 such as MacLow , Burroughs (Cage), etc. and moreso, are they using
              technological mediums and how are they relating it to
                performance, chance, etc.?

Ron & Co.:
 
If it's Wilmington, NC, the poet Michael White teaches out there
at UNCC. Doesn't seem like there's a lot of experimental writing
or readings going on out there, although Black Mountain and
Jonathan Williams are nearby . . .
 
I'm new to POETICS, so I suppose I'm losing my virginity with
this post!
 
Two things on my mind. As poets, do we only apply for jobs in
places we'd like to live or do we take what we can get, relying
on cyberspace to compensate for the outposts that we eventually find
ourselves stationed at? I've been living out here in Mt. Vernon (IA)
since '94, and were it not for Eastern Iowa's cultural mecca of
Iowa City, I'd be goin nuts. Trips to Chicago do help, but now, as I
scan the latest job listings, it seems that only the jobs that provide
an upgrade in location have any appeal. And access to the internet
seems vital!
 
Secondly, and this is for Chris S., did Tate's workshop or the
program at UMass Amherst provide a space for you to write in
or was it finally unacceptable? Did a fellowship lure you there?
As a graduate student, I was willing to study at whatever program
would give me enough money to get by and write. I wonder if
post-graduates aren't forced to do the same kind of dance.

Subject:      Complex city/ scene- ery
 
I would be interested in hearing from older poets with more experience about
what their visions for an ideal "poetry scene" in any city might be.  I've
lived in Philadelphia recently and considered "the scene" as the people
comprising the audience who showed up for Ron's reading on Walnut Street one
night; or, away from university sponsored events, the crowd who attended Yusef
Komunyaka's reading at the Painted Bride just a month and a mile or so apart.
More recently, I got to know many of the people Gale Nelson lists as residing
in Providence when I was living in the Ocean State last year.  The events I was
able to get to were sponsored by Brown, but that didn't make them any less
pleasant.  (Of course both cities have their share of presses and magazines,
but they are more like props in the scene).
 
Staying as vague as possible: I thought both cities were wonderful.
 
What should be the basic function of a poetry scene? Formal and informal
interaction among poets?  What else?
Is an academic environment more ideal or less ideal than, say, an arts center?
What about the larger environment- a "city of the corporations?" which neither
Philly nor Providence are, or a city where the poets are mainly found on a
campus?
 
I've been in Boston for six months and have met precious few (read: 2) poets.
Can anybody offer any encouraging insight into this place?

Tenney,
 
My questions were rhetorical. Saying that money is poetry is the same kind
of chicanery as calling a missle with a nuclear war-head a Peace-Keeper.
Ed is probably right, Wally, no doubt, had a better understanding of the
machinations of money than Waldo did of the drudgery of workers (at that
time in Emerson's  vacinity, they would most likely have been textile
workers, an industry  which then relied almost exclusively on child labor,
mostly females who typically began their "careers" at age seven or eight and
rarely lived beyond their teens because of lung disease and other work place
hazards).
 
If "money is a kind of poetry" then perhaps those dashes that Emily
Dickinson used are actually be coded messages from an alien civilization.
 
Best regards,
Jonathan

Some of you may recall that last summer I solicited your help in throwing
a course together I am to teach this spring: 20th century technology and
esthetics.  I'm now closer to a syllabus but I need your help again (and
forgive the redundancy quotient here if any): is there an anthology that
contains the following poets: WCW, Hart Crane, LZ, Oppen, Bronk, MacLow,
Cage, Ronald Johnson.  You will note the absence of women on this list.
I will not go forward without some women poets.  But who?  Someone mentioned
Kathy Acker.  How about Susan Howe (not really)? Joan Retelllack maybe?
 
But anyway, I would very much like to order an anthology (rather than make
up my own) if I can find one that's serviceable.  I plan to use Perloff's
The Futurist Moment and Steinman's Made in America as companion pieces (as
well as other books though the others are not concerned with poetry necessarily).

My feeling is that as a poet I try and create my job. I haven't heard of any
job I can apply for to be a poet (believing that being a poet is not by any
means the same thing as teaching poetry). So, whether it's getting involved
in teaching, or nonprofit organizations, or freelance writing, or design, or
business of various sorts, it seems to me if one wants to be somewhere in
particular, she or he can do that. Taking "what we can get" seems an odd
concept.

Great!  This is something I've been wanting to do for some time and was
trying to figure out ways to physically look through words into other
words underneath by doing something like a pop-up books, but I've never
had time.  The thing that bothers me about hypertext (which I've never
used, so I may be talking up a grass snoot) is the time element.  You
wouldn't actually be looking simultaneously through one word at another.
There'd be a time lapse wouldn't there?

Jim Rosenberg is absolutely right:
>The computer also brings some difficult *problems* to the table.
Given the rapid pace of change in the computer industry, how easy will
it be to find a computer 50 years from now that can run today's
computer poetry?  Whose burden is it to be sure there's a way to
display the work?  A lot of questions to be answered.
 
 
My sense is that any work in hypertext that is good would be good
writing in an absolutely hide-bound traditional print format. Consider
how great Blake can seem evn when removed from the illumined
manuscript.
 
Also, the word on the street is that the archivists are avoiding
collecting disks of manuscripts like the plague, even though in many
programs you could tell, for example, how many levels of revision (and
length of composition) were involved.
 
If you get one of the those greeting cards that plays a tune when
opened, it's using a chip that has more computing capacity than the US
military had for all of WW2. In 2025, the average laptop (if that form
is still popular) will almost certainly have more power than is
contained in all of silicon valley.
 
These tools at hand are still very primitive, if we just envision what
they will look like in 100 years. (The typewriter was an invention of
the Civil War, a means of bringing reports home from the front, which
is why/how Remington, a rifle manufacturer, got involved. The internet
was conceived as a means of decentralizing the national computing
architecture so that it would survive WW3. Then it took off on its
own.)

technology (rated, say, in equiv. numbers of transistors per) will be many

   in NYC and it is certainly achievable in non (or para) institutional
    contexts, the interstices, late night chance encounters, etc--but
    it would be helpful I think to see more of a mutually challenging
    community there. One thing I keep coming back to is the Perelman
    WRITING/TALKS series and the "frutiful collision" that seemed to allow.
    in the then-developing and wide ranging group of poets brought into
    dialogue with each other. If the inbreeding at the ear is as you say
    but "the growing pangs of a coalescing group" let's hope that coalescing
    doesn't mean reifying (or more dreadfully reified).
    As for your talk on FACTIONS---well, another thing i keep coming back
    to from my experience in Phila. was that it seemed that the knowledge
    that there were less poets there enabled an openess to cross-pollinization
    or at least dialogue of the NYC equivalent of the Jewish Y scene and
    the nuyorican and the ear inn tyes (I mean the phila equivalent) than
    I have seen in NYC from my admitted "peripheral" perspective. Nonetheless,
    much morew can be done on these points in BOTH cities (and should be).
RON: You claim that GIL OTT "developed that entire scene"---Let me offer
     a correction (without attempting to "put Gil down"--who i very much
     respect---but i think Gil would agree with me here. That scene was also
     in part the work of Lamont Steptoe (who is now based in the Walt
     Whitman center in Camden--and like Gil suffered from PBAC politics)--
     who paired many lesser-known younger poets with more established ones
     (myself, for instance, with Gerald Stern and then Berstein and Ott)
     and also broke down certain racial divisions (and their often aesthetic
     counterparts between the slam scene and the more sophisticated scenes--
     (put sophisticated in quotes) whether "mainstream" or "avant-garde")
     AND WHO IS JOSHUA SCHUSTER??????? Could you tell me? I'm curious.
     Maybe you could put us in touch.
     Also, do you know Dave Baratier--Pavement Saw press. Temple M.A.
     student (but also with a JOB in business world, so THERE!)--
     He is involved in a very interesting salon that includes some
     young poets (mostly women i think) involved with APR, Boulevard
     and the Painted bride Quarterly (ethel rackin for instance)....
     Definitely a young, vital, intelligent and friendly scene (whose
     taste is wider than one MIGHT imagine).
     DB told me he went to one of your readings and that he's been trying
     to get work from you and Perelman for his mag.
TIM: Good to hear from you (after all these years). The U-MASS experience
     basically SUCKED for me--which is why I'm in a Ph.D> program now and
     not a MFA. Though I respect Tate in much the way i respect Koch for
     freeing my writing from my (perhaps reductive?) reading of the LANGPO
     aesthetic and "recentering" me, as am teacher he was dreadful and
     irresponsible and simply "not there" (even though he DID once defend
     one of my poems from a challenge YOU made!) Yet, it's quite easy for
     him to say "I have faith in the process"--meaning the MFA creative
     writing process of weeding out the "wheat" from the "chaff"--(where
     I mean were you there when he said that?--i think he did more than
     once) considering the fact that he never had to work outside of the
     academy since he was 23! Anyway, I actually found myself defending
     Bernstein to him (and it fell on deaf ears). Now, I don't mean to
     simply attack that process wholecloth, but I found as much closemind-
     edness there as I do among certain avantgardists too. I don't know
     if this answers your question. Chris S.

Your comments, Larry Price, about form and theory, got me thinking about
Paul Ricour's Rule of Metaphor. and yes, there is an attempt to take these
things, poetry, speech, lexis etc, and treat them in isolated fashion (are
we trying to get outside a so-called poetry-mind and look back in to see its
all?)The arguments around the, as you say, circulation of, accretion of
signification, etc, could continue, in their own perspective, outside any
other prerogative, as empiricism, as science does do. What is interesting
about Ricour's study of these things, and in particular, poetic form, the
language of poetry, is, he determines, in the end, to listen to the language
of everyday, the philosophy of everyday language I believe he says, and from
that, draw a sort of categorial perspective of language, away from, as it
were, the dictates of other so called possibilities and imaginations, real
situations in their own intellectual right....but doesn't this all come down
to the apprehension of the difference in "economic" man, and "spiritual"
man, as, among others, MacDiarmid would have said...this pragmatics, this
existentialism's but a poem?.....etc etc

Subject:      Computers and Writing
 
There is an interview with Roland Barthes in which he talks
at length about his writing pens, an array of them apparently,
the barbarity of ball-points and such.  Which I take as a
reminder of how hard it is to make poems without tools-chisel,
Parker, or Mac.
 
So I've been following the recent thread (what are we weaving)
which seems to be dealing with creation, presentation, and representation
of writing through computers.  Chris Funkhouser's observation of the
literal-mindedness of some options is to the point.  The Comptons
Encyclopedia CD-ROM doesn't offer much inspiration, formal or
otherwise.
 
But there is no obvious reason why the tech need perform such a limiting
rendering of the poem.  Simple gestures, like adding two slightly
variant vocal tracks to a poem, suddenly open up meaning and possibility.
 
Joe's tinkertoy analogy is partly apt--we can wrest much from tech as
it now stands, including (Charles) that time-tested Codice TM.
Working to lay words on the page or screen, working with the
intonation or pace of a poem.
 
Perhaps it is the Barthes' interview again--his pen fetish seemed
to carefully relegate 'typewriter' technology to the status of
reproduction, duplication; no one could write there, except,
one supposes, his secretary (who was not queried)--but there seems
an almost violence in the gesture to decline (suppress) the
relation of computers to writing when, for most here reading
this at least, it is (for better or worse) quite central.

Beth,
 
Judith Goldman, a recent graduate of Brown, who is now living in New York,
has done some fascinating poetic projects; among them, a series of Rubik
cubes, repasted with language. Each "twist" of the cube leads not toward
solid colors on   each of the cube's sides; but rather, to a new poem. She
also has designs for some fantastic poetry organs, that would inflate
different word patterns based on chance fillings of various word balloons.
She also works in collage and "inspiration" (meaning she sits down and
writes) methods.
 
While it is not a chance operation, _The Pumice of Morons_ was an interesting
S + 7 project (Clark Coolidge and Larry Fagan?), produced shortly after the
Clinton innauguration by The Figures Press.

An anthology that includes none of the persons on your list for technology
and poetry, I would still suggest turning your attention to the Blue
Mustache (Elizabeth Press, I believe) -- an anthology of Italian Futurist
Poetry in translation.
 
MM's poetry will sometimes move in the mechanized way of early 20th century
machinery; she would turn up in many of the modernist anthologies which would/
should include WCW and LZ.
 
J. Drucker's work would seem appropriate in this context -- both in its
(largely old-technology) production and (her prose work) in content.
 
R. Waldrop's _Camp Printing_ shows to interesting effect old (letterpress)
and new (offset) printing techniques working together to make
fascinating visual literature.
 
Cheers,

There is also what the computer allows you to output to paper and related
media -- the ability to achieve typographic effects (shading and distortion
of text, etc.) which would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive
before desktop typesetting. Mulit-linearity in a piece, for example, can be
representing by different colours or shades (as well as using transparent
sheets as Charles suggested).

The ability to archive and reproduce digital work really is a big problem.
Although one of the good things about HTML is that is (or at least 'was') a
part of SGML, a standard designed, partly, to allow the preservation and
reproduction of the structure as well as the content of complex documents.
I guess that it will get easier and easier to translate such structure from
on system to another and that much of the work now being done will be able
to be reproduced.

Yes, much of the good writing that has been inscribed as hypertext would be
good in other media. But this is not an argument which implies that it
*should* appear in another form. That is a decision within the gift of the
writer. Some writing, however, either could not exist in more 'traditional'
media, or would not be so elegantly presented as it would in
cyber/hypertext (there is a useful distinction here, btw).
 
In particular, I mean texts where 'chance operations' and/or algorithmic
transformations are applied to given texts and the writer insists that the
'real time' results of these procedural operations *are* her inscription on
the surface of a complex medium. (Where did I get that formulation from?
Was it from someone on Poetics?) I would also argue, as I have elsewhere,
that the cybertual author has the potential to compose procedures
themselves and this should become a recognized part of the process of
inscription/writing.
 
As for elegance of presentation: it would be possible to transpose Jim's
_Intergrams_ to paper-like media in, perhaps, a huge book-art installation.
But one of the beauties of this work is its elegance -- the deep complexity
produced by the layering which his HyperCard form allows; the ability not
simply to move through layers of word clusters, but also to move up and
down a syntactically structured hierarchy of such clusters, to obtain
multiple views of the 'same' content. All this is done with minimal, and as
I say, elegant programming. That said, it is the content-as-form which is
the tenor of the (all) work, leading to its ultimate significance.
 
So what if the cybertext systems of the new millenium will be tiny implants
with the power of a Cray? Today's text processing system is *not* the civil
war typewriter of tomorrow, because it is realized on shape-shifting
silicon and I guess that the computers of tomorrow will not be
qualitatively different from the computers of today (i.e. they will still
be faceless,invisible machines programmed to perform as any all
as-yet-undreamt-of appliances). The computer underlies the systems we're
using but it is not to be identified with them. It transforms itself into
typewriter, typesetter, cybertext system, etc, etc through software.
Primitive software needn't be written off, it can be rewritten or
'upgraded'.
 
Computer-based hardware/software configurations became potential media for
literary art in, I would say, the late 80s when reasonably designed screen
fonts, wysiwyg, and software such as HyperCard first appeared. Now that the
WWW is with us, there is *no* reason not to make substantive use of the
various potential media available [-- and transpose the 'good stuff' back
into print if you insist].
 
There's a more serious problem with the idea of writing underlying Ron's
post, as if there is something called 'writing' which exists independently
of its actually inscription in a particular medium, and which, *if* it is
'good', has the additional quality of being capable of transposition into
media with which we are more familiar.  Does this hold up?
 
The archivists Ron cites are wrong, wrong, wrong. It is not for the
archivist to determine what is a proper record of the writers' processes of
composition. If a writer happens to make a draft on a disk using the first
version of Wordstar usign a Sirius PC, or on the inside of a matchbox, and
then later destroys or encrypt all early drafts of an unpublished work that
circulated on the bulletin board of a private network -- I just can't see
that the archival or text critical problems this might cause are made
*qualitatively* different because of the media used, or that this indicates
that we should all make sure to *get it down on paper* in order to keep the
librarians happy.
 
Finally, although I completely accord with the tenor of Joe's light-hearted
response to Ron's post, I can't help baulking at the image of the tinkertoy
(which I also learned from during a Canadian childhood), the implication
that *despite* the likelihood that these systems will appear to be *toys*
to the right-thinking, we can nonetheless use and learn from them in our
spare time.
 
Computer-based systems are emphatically *not* tinkertoys, not even in the

john, nice discussion, from my pov anyway... yes, you're right---there was
an implicit condescension in my choice of tinkertoy as proto/tool/col---and
it suggests a developmental-evolutionary model of composition/construction,
in any case, a movement from toys (today) to serious tools (tomorrow)...
the progress-ive displacement of doing something significantly different,
in formal terms, b/c of a latent bias toward unmediated content (read
"preference for a specific formal content")... which i would like to avoid,
in fact, however 'powerful' or 'sophisticated' our future media/tools may
be... the inverse of my (faulty) logic leading, of course, to the
infantilization of all that has come (long) before us as "primitive,"
"child-like"...
 
still, there are times i would wish to reclaim the ludic in child-like
terms, without any residual connotation of childish drivel... my
(childish?) utopian urges prevailing here, methinks...
 
anyway, yes, the formal qualities of the medium cannot be neglected or
transcended, finally, without a corresponding reduction in potential value,
if you will... from my pov, there's always the specificity of mediation to
consider... this is what the emergence of electronic form, for one, has
raised to the fore...

Actually, I think this assumes that you would be paying someone to
accomplish such typographic effects for you, rather than doing them yourself
on a letterpress or with offset printing methods. And, I know, many more
people have computers than have such presses -- but, in fact, my Vandercook
letterpress I  bought in 1979, and another I bought a couple of months ago,
even taking the cost together, set me back far less than the computer I
bought in 1989. There are people who pay others to achieve such typographic
effects using the computer, rather than doing such things themselves; that
is also prohibitively expensive for most of us.
 
So I'm probably just carping here, but it's interesting the way the computer
tools have created a bunch of do-it-yourselfers, far more than were created
by the inexpensive proliferation of letterpress equipment which occurred
when letterpress became commercially outmoded a couple to four decades ago.
And I'm a convert, too, although only amazingly envious of the skills
developed by such as Jim Rosenberg & John Cayley.

I admire Ron immensely, but I hope this doesn't hold up. Much of the work I
have done in books has intended to create meaningful reading experiences, so
the books (particularly the handmade books in various exploratory formats)
are intended as wholes. They are not the only possible realization of the
written works by any means, but I would like to thinkthey are more
significant than eventual footnotes as "deluxe editions" of works which in
some distant future will only be seen in the rather banal presentation of an
author's collected poems or collected writings (including my own). It is the
variations in reading contexts, as much as "the words themselves" (I once
wrote, somewhere I don't quite remember -- "there never is such a thing as
the words themselves"), which need to be preserved. Emily's dashes, Blake's
illuminations, and meaningful (to the reader, writer, other makers) editions
of works, in paper or hypertext or other media to be developed, which may
not be entirely under the direction of the author (but which hopefully have
her approval).

Yes, they are what we make of them. But don't we, at times, do it with a
sense of imaginative play. Tinker toys and Lincoln logs may have been my toy
of youth; duplos and legos to more recent children (and they are still with
us); but one of my daughters' (now ages 2 & 6) tools to learn about
making/building will be the computer. I know the 6-year-old already thinks
of computer time as play time. Is that wrong? I hope not.

Jordan, so many things, like -- big enough space, but absolutely not too
big; enough light to read by and see reader, but, again, not at all
"bright." also, there needs to be quiet in the space (having suffered
recently from having readings & talks in a small area of a large space with
fluorescents which constantly buzzed, driving me crazy); give options to
reader as to whether to sit or stand -- if sitting, table in front or at
side of reader is nice; if standing, i like a table or stand to the side for
papers, but do not like standing behind podiums, and do not like music
stands unless they are extremely sturdy ones. I think readings are best in
settings which do not need amplification of reader via microphone, mixer, &
speakers -- but if there's any question at all, by all means have these
things, and have decent ones, well tested beforehand. If possible, allow for
semi-circular seating, giving everyone in audience a direct view of
reader/readers. Yet I think all of this can be done and remain in a
relatively informal setting, not requiring an auditorium (small or large)
setting, which sets up more of a distance between reader and audience.
 
I think I'm talking mostly here about readings for audiences of 10 to 80
people. For more than that, unless the space is very carefully arranged, a
small auditorium may work best. And I've both been to and given readings in
mid-sized (200 - 600) auditoriums which worked very well. Still, I prefer
the more intimate settings.
 
All this said (and much more which probably should be said), the key
ingredients are still reader and audience. As a reader, great audiences
(such as at Small Press Traffic, or Canessa Park, or Ear Inn; or, in quite a
different sense, at U-Alabama) have made for great experiences. And
certainly audiences recognize when a reader is really connecting both with
the work and with the audience. It's a complex interaction which, strangely
enough, often works quite well (and often doesn't).
 
You also ask about what makes it work for the host. Having been one for
small readings and large festival readings, it seems to me that if it works
for reader and audience, it will work for host. Also, the host has to relax.
There's no way that everything will be ideal, yet the best readings
transcend their physical circumstances, anyway.
 
And it can always help to have Kevin Killian do the introductions.
Seriously, introductions are important, and ought to give some insight into
what is to come, but should never go so far as to condition what one is to
hear. I heard the worst on a recent videotape, in which the introducer told
the audience what the author was up to and what was important about her or
him, then came on again after the reading and commented on what was just
heard. That's just unforgivable.
 
Are you asking these questions because you're about to launch a reading series?
 
all best,
charles

I seem to be the tone-deaf piper in this thread, so I'm probably missing
some dark & twisty twist here--but, yeah.  That was the point more or less
of my since-maligned (by Jonathan) note on Emerson and capital.  What
Wallace made happen w $ (the Java box for example) was a lot like what he
made happen w poetry, or in it. (Whereas) even in his relatively
anti-capitalist phases, or moments, the power of imagination Emerson extols
is frequently described in terms that bear a striking affinity to what
capital can be understood as doing.  One needn't find this altogether
beneficent to find it interesting.  (& then of course there's the whole
cash-nexus trope in /Pragmatism/, that Emersonian inheritance [ahem] passed
on in turn to Stevens.)
 
Speaking of Pound, the essay by I think it is Andrew Parker, in the Arac
collection /Postmodernism and Politics/, does some very smart mapping of
Pound's anti-semitism onto both his Douglasite economics and his vision of
language, in ways conversant w Kristeva's treatment of anti-semitism in Celine.

The too would take issue with  an "idea of writing ... which exists
independently of its actually inscription in a particular medium"
though I'm not sure Silliman wouldn't also reject such a notion of
the immaterial.
 
Paying attention to the various technologies of presentation available
to writing, now, at this point, does make me want to second (or did
I already 2nd it) Joe's assignation of "tinkertoys".
 
Calling various forms of computer-writing tinkertoy technology is
absolutely right, since these forms WILL become outmoded because of
the role this tech plays apart from poetry.  The "BOOK", itself a
technology which has changed (hand scripted to letterpress to
desktop lazerjet) does not tend to outmode itself.  The product,
eg my 1899 Small, Maynard and Company _Leaves of Grass_ works still,
and quite as easily, as _Poems for the Millenium_ 1995.
 
Reading the media surrounding the computer industry should make
nothing more clear than that (1) it is a technology of designed
obsolence and (2) it is almost implicity obsessed with its own
devolopmental design curve.  (viz my version of Mosaic software
which sports pull-down menus which result in the message
'feature not impletmented yet'.)
 
This (economic) condition needs to be dealt with, and then we
still go on writing in that space, working with our tinkertoys
(which are such only because the designers are at work relegating
them to that status) and profiting from their seeming possibilities
and limits.

I agree completely. Moreover, I've been surprised at their stance. One
would think, given, say, the status of re-creation in painting (for
example), that some program somewhere would take it upon itself to
preserve early operating systems and applications, in and for
themselves, and to create the methodology for "restoration" of lost
materials. There's probably a lot of literature already "lost" on C/PM
and other pre-DOS desktop systems and untangling the flavors of UNIX
could become a career in itself.
 
By the way, John, I'm not suggesting that works of writing should or
should not be on paper or on interactive systems, or other modes (I've
mucked around with "slide" presentation programs like PowerPoint and
Freelance and even Harvard Graphics and could imagine using Macromind
Director as a staging tool). But rather, in work that resonates over
time, there is a relation between the words that will carry the text
forward, regardless of the presentation. Otherwise it would have been a
"mistake" ever to have written Homer down.

I too am pro-Tinkertoy. Poetry needs that sense of limitless freedom
and possibility. Similarly, it needs humor and a whole slew of other
"less than serious" (or at least less than pompous) devices. Reading
Anselm Hollo and Ted Berrigan last night to my 3-year-old twins,
realizing just how important it is that poetry can have that dimension,
and how vastly undervalued it is (and people like Anselm, or Jack
Collum or Jonathon Williams, for example).

Having done three series over the years (Grand Piano, Tassajara Bakery,
The Farm), my sense is that the very best readings took place when
there was a slight aesthetic tension between the readers, enough for
each to set the other's work off in a new light, and to bring in an
audience that would be "exposed" to the work of the other in some way
for the first time. Best single reading I ever coordinated was probably
George Stanley and Ted Berrigan at the Grand Piano. We had maybe 60
people for each reader (and the place really only held about 80, so it
was crammed probably past the fire department's limits) and very few
seemed even to have heard of the other poet. Unfortunately, the poets
held separate parties for their own entourages afterwards. I recall, at
the Berrigan party, some local NY school wannabe putting George's
poetry down (not even aware of, say, the connections to Spicer et al or
of the Vancouver scene) and Ted cutting this geek down instantly,
explaining concisely and explicitly what was terrific about Stanley's
work.
 
But there is always a huge risk in such a combination. Too often we
held readings that simply convinced the other's audience that the
reading was for The Other community, so both stayed away. (Tom, did we
really combine Simon Ortiz and Judy Grahn? Or have the brain cells
simply melted back there?)
 
I always think the best reading series have a visible sense of shape,
of argument. As such. The demographic/aesthetic scatter that
characterizes the typical college series (trying to please each
constituency) tends to drain that away.
 
Imagine each season as though it were a book,

  I've been reading the Emerson-Stevens Money thread with some "interest"--
  I wonder what kind of "toll" it has taken on me (for surely once the
  microcosm-macrocosm metaphor is entertained it becomes difficult to
  wish or wisk away without a shot of Lethe that Universal Health Care
  would surely make available to all)---
  "Seriously" however--
  I have often distrusted and been skeptical of (which isn't to say I
  myself do not "employ" I mean "deploy" perhaps far too much) the
  linkage it seems Nathanson for instance is making (though I too may
  be tone deaf)--not so much between "politics" and "poetic form" (via
  a bi-directional OF),but between....Maybe this is better stated by way
  of an "oversimplistic" Spielbergian (alias Manichean) binary a fellow-
  teacher of mine told me she used to generate class discussion:
  She wrote STEVENS=InSURANCE SALESMAN and WILLIAMS=DOCTOR on the board
  and basically meant the former as "evil" and the latter as 'good"--
  Such a GRID seems to lie at the "root" of much recent work
  (again the work on Yeats' Fascist Metrics coming out, for instance)
  and I am curious WHY people seem to be so interested in such arguments?
  I may be seem to be conflating two things here, two kinds of "form"
  that seem to "inform" the "content" of the poem. Insofar as the form
  is the content, to what extent is the POET the POEM?
  And though these are important questions, the whole notion that the
  reader and the writer are collaborators in the making of the work,
  if taken seriously, would seem to render questionable predetermined
  notions of exactly what STEVENS' or WCW's (for instance) stance truly
  is--insofar as their work lives more in the (un?)consciousnesses of
  those who read them than it does in the books.
  But, when the question of poetry as a kind of money comes up (as in
  THE MERCHANT OF VENUS), I don't mean to beg it. But, it's always
  possible that such "large-scale cultural thinking" may not be that
  different from the kind of so-called "solipsism" that is purely
  aesthetic (also in quotes) like "the chance meeting of a sewing
  machine and an umbrella...". In other words, money as poetry and
  poetry as money (either way), in Stevens and in Perelman, and in
  others, are tropes, metaphors with two vehicles vying for the status
  of tenor. And theory here can be "endlessly productive" no doubt
  but FOR WHAT?  cs

this seems as good a time as any to insert into this discussion an excerpt
from jed rasula's _the american poetry wax museum:  reality effects,
1940-1990_ (ncte)... i'm not through reading jed's book, but nary a page i
turn when i don't find mself forced to stop and consider what he's saying,
and the precise provocations and passions with which he sez it... if it
wouldn't bother folks to say so, i might say jed's book is a must-read...
 
anyway, here's the excerpt, from chapter 1, p. 33:
 
"While the 'carceral archipelago' and the 'exhibitionary complex' developed
contemporaneously, the latter requires institutions 'not of confinement but
of exhibition' (Bennett 124, 123).  The exhibitionary complex is
instrumental in organizing consent, effecting voluntaristic unanimity by
remote promptings.  The exhibit, reified into the enshrined venue of the
museum, is a prototype version of hypertext, training populations in the
art of reassembling fragmentary evidence into coherent narratives.  The
museum is a transitional education in the negotiation of hyperspace, the
solipsistic euphoria of simulated connectedness.  It need not be carceral
because its inmates are self-regulating.  The museum begins with the goal
of character building and ends up in the zone of interactive technologies,
the task now being that of 'building a person' in the cyborg world.  When
Friedrich Kittler characterizes the book of poetry as 'the first medium in
the modern sense,' I think not only of 'McLuhan's law, according to which
the content of a medium is always another medium' (115), but of the
spiritualists' *medium*, also known as the 'control.'  My concern, in
elaborating this thesis of a poetry wax museum, is to suggest that the
seemingly autonomous 'voices and visions' of poets themselves have been
underwritten by custodial sponsors who have surreptitiously turned down the
volume on certain voices, and simulated a voice-over for certain others.
Nothing defines the situation more succinctly than the police phrase
*protective custody*."
 
(** = author's emphasis)
 
it would be interesting to extrapolate jed's logic to the hypercard stack,
*celtic museum*... four-five years back, the latter was one of the more
elegant applications around of hypertext technologies...
 
now:  i understand that this excerpt is likely to be interpreted by some,
extracted as it is, as yet another in a long line of critiques of

I'm jumping in blindly after being away from the list for a little while,
but K. Sherwood's post about Barthes' computerphobia reminded me of a
little "color" piece in the paper awhile back on the current state of
the writing scene in Paris cafes--full of Parisian writer-types decrying
the use of laptops in the cafes...  So mebbe it's a French thang... (but
then, there had to be enough laptops for them to start decrying...
 
Meanwhile, the cool java hut here in town (Higher Grounds) is about to

well, i guess it was typewriterphobia Barthes had, not computerphobia--
didn't mean to jump over a whole stage of technology...
 
that reminds me of Hugh Kenner speaking at the Orono poetry conference
a couple years ago--talking about how the first famous poem composed
on a typewriter may have been Pound's...."The Return."  Kenner didn't
seem to get the joke, but all the poets laughed...

There's one thing that has to be said here and SAID LOUDLY:  I hope no one
comes away from this discussion thinking that those of us doing experiments
with various computer media are trying to hype these media as in any way
"superior" to the traditional ones.  We've seen this movie before in the
poetry world, and it has a bad ending.  There were some among the Concrete
Poets who took a very polemical stance about "straight" poetry [*their* term]
being "obsolete" compared to Concrete Poetry.  It's simply impossible to
calculate the damage to poetics that this caused.  The mind simply boggles
at the thought of what might have come out of a real dialogue between the
concrete poets and the Black Mountain poets -- but it never happened.  You
can call this a prejudice if you want to [I'm gonna get myself in trouble
for this] but I and most of the poets I know blame the concrete poets for
this:  they weren't interested in dialogue.  That catastrophe set back the
cause of poetics by 20 years at the least.  (Even today, right here on this
list, how often do we talk about visual poetry, and what visual issues mean
for poetics???)  It would be a very deep tragedy indeed if those of us who
do hypertext repeated this same mistake.
 
There *are* those in the hypertext community who are a bit loose with
unguided missile phrases like "death of the book", "late age of print", and
so on; I'm record as saying I don't think we do ourselves any good with that
kind of talk.  There is one house of poetry, it includes us all regardless of
media.
 
When Judy Roitman sent me her poems she said she thought I'd find them
"ordinary".  This was painful to hear.  Sure, if I look at the poems with my
glasses off maybe nothing will jump out and strike me as unusual, but reading
the poems there was nothing ordinary about them at all:  the effect was very
complex and subtle even though you couldn't ascribe that to "media".
 
Since this is World Series time, please allow me to cite that celebrated
literary theorist, Hank Aaron.  A sportswriter (whose name escapes me) was
interviewing Hank Aaron, and being just insufferable trying to show off his
baseball knowledge.  He set out a truly arcane scenario and was trying to
get Hank Aaron to say what kind of pitch he'd expect in that situation --
such and such was the score, such and such was the count, such and such
runners on base -- on and on.  He finally finished, turned to Hank Aaron and
said, "And what would you look for in that situation?"  Hank Aaron looked him
in the eye and said, "I look for the baseball."
 
I do love to get into these issues of media, but really, that pretty much
says it all:  When you get right down to it, it doesn't matter if you're
using the latest unavailable research software, or writing out a poem
longhand, or just sitting on a tree stump composing words in your head.
Ultimately, all of us, day in and day out, have to just go out there and
look for the baseball.

Part of me can agree with this, but another part wants to rise up and say,
"Them's fightin' words!"
 
I agree that hypertext writers have the same burden as every other kind of
writer to write well; ultimately it is indeed the words themselves that
matter; if you extract words from a hypertext and look at them on the page
then they should bear the same level of artistic weight that out-of-context
extractions from a traditional poem should bear.  The key phrase here is:
"out of context" -- and one has to be clear it is exactly *extractions* that
are being dealt with.
 
Ron, if what you're saying is that the words of a hypertext should work just
fine on the page as a linear "hide-bound traditional print" poem, I've got a
problem.  That is tantamount to saying that the non-linear structure just
plain doesn't matter.  I would venture to say (even though any such statement
as this is risky) that *every person on this list* has encountered people who
are uncomfortable with poetry, who when dealing with a poem frankly wish that
the author had written something other than a poem.  Never mind, we write it
as a poem because we feel that is *the only way* it will work.  So too with
hypertext: ultimately one writes a hypertext from a belief that no other
medium will do; the non-linear structure is not some kind of "illustration",
it is integral to the content.
 
Does Ketjak "work on the page" if I print it one word per page?  Maybe, but
it isn't the same animal.  Suppose you take a poem by, say, Robert Duncan --
one of the Passages series for instance -- and print it as a prose block.
Maybe it "works" this way, maybe someone who knew Duncan's work well enough
could reconstruct the line breaks anyway, but we can all just imagine what
Duncan's outrage would have been at this sort of thing.
 
To stand this issue completely on its head:  my own interest goes in the
exact opposite direction, namely using hypertext to carry the infrastructure
of language itself: hypertext inside the fine structure of language, *inside
the sentence*.  The piece I am working on now (which is taking *forever* to
execute, alas) uses simultaneities nested many many layers deep, in some
cases going inside the sentence.  In this case I'm not even sure what "would
be good writing in an absolutely hide-bound traditional print format"
*means*.  The idea that a hypertext can be rendered on the page in some
fashion is based on a "lexia-centric" view of hypertext; ('lexia' is a term
borrowed by George Landow from the writings of Barthes to mean the unit of
text at either end of a hypertext link) but dematerialization of the lexia
has been an active topic of discussion in the hypertext community, to which I
and Stuart Moulthrop among others have contributed.  To recast Ron's
statement in the current lingo of hypertext rhetoric: Ron asserts that the
lexia themselves should work on the page as writing.  Surely lexia should be
good writing -- if there *are* lexia.  But one interesting direction in
hypertext is to employ interactive structure operations to the point that the
concept of lexia itself ceases to have much meaning.

That would depend on how it's actually implemented.  You *could* implement
this by "exploding" a word cluster so that all the elements are visible on
the screen at the same time.  I've been reluctant to do this for a couple of
reasons.  First of all, if the cluster is heavily nested there simply may not
be enough screen real estate to accomplish this.  Second, graphic print
conventions would impose an order on the elements to some degree.  This is a
hard problem to deal with, but I like a form of interactivity where by using
the mouse the user can choose which element to go to.
 
So you are right, that done the way I do it there is a time lapse.  The whole
issue of how time should work in hypertext -- poetic time particularly -- is
the biggest single area in hypertext where I feel things are not well
understood.  I hope to achieve a sense in which time is somehow "disengaged"
-- running free, so to speak.  Of course this is an illusion:  in an obvious
sense one's *experience* of a hypertext is linear by virtue of time.  But it
is the reader's time, not the writer's time.  I have an intuitive sense of
units of time that are somehow "interchangeable" -- but whether this really
comes off in the poem I'm not sure.  Time in a hypertext has to be local
units spatially anchored, it seems to me.
 
How should sound work in a hypertext?  This is a very similar issue.  To be
perfectly candid about it, I'm still grappling with this.  Of course sound
brings the time issue to a head:  sound brings with it its own sense of time.
How does one reconcile a "disengaged" sense of time under the control of the
reader with an inflexible concept of time brought by sound?  Again, time is
constrained via "local units of sound", but unconstrained in the large.
 
How does one *program* time?  There are some very difficult questions here.
(I hope John will jump in on this, since he's done the most interesting work
I've seen with programming time in computer poetry.)  One thing I like to say
to myself all the time is that:
 
Syllable Time is not equal to Real Time
 
In syllable time our impression of time -- in English at any rate -- is
heavily dominated by retroactive impressions based on what's happening with
*stresses* more than an absolute musical sense of time that a composer would
have.  Let me give an example of what I'm talking about.  Back in the early
70s I did a number of pieces on magnetic tape using simultaneous overlays of
my own voice.  Somewhere in this process I hit on the idea of using tape
loops to get very precise control over the way that the individual tracks
were offset.  I would make a tape loop out of the overlaid segment I already
had, make a tape loop out of the new voice I was adding, and by delaying one
or the other loop slightly I could shift the overlay until I got exactly what
I wanted.  (It does some interesting things to one's head to play tape loops
for hours on end ...)  I had a composition schema that told me an overlay
structure I was trying to achieve, and I remember very clearly one case where
I wanted all the attacks (in the musical sense of the onset of sound) to line
up.  As one particular overlay went around I knew I had nailed it exactly.  I
cut the loop and spliced it in, and indeed the attacks lined up perfectly.
Then for some reason I started playing it back slowed down.  What I heard
shocked me.  At full speed it sounded like the attacks were dead
simultaneous, but at slow speed it became obvious that the attacks -- in the
musical sense of the word -- were not simultaneous *at all*.  So why did it
sound that way at full speed?  Because the *stresses* were dead simultaneous!
I was "hearing" the attacks as being right at the same time "retroactively"
because the stresses hit at the same time.
 
So again the question:  How does one *program* syllable time?  I frankly
don't know the answer to that. At a naive go, a programmer's time is likely
to be absolute musical time.  John?

Subject:      Where's the Hypertext in this Thread?
 
The recent hypertext/writing discussion on the list has been one with
misdirected salvos. It began as a conversation on computer-generated
texts but ended up being about whether hypertext was a "new form" of
writing. Then computers became tinkertoys along the way. (Though John
Cayley did argue against this, that "they are what we make from
them.") Also striking, Ken Sherwood's "calling various forms of
cmputer-writing tinkertoy technologies is absolutely right" based on
the fact that these technologies will become outmoded. The parallel by
Charles Alexander of the book presentation of finely made books as
against Ron's 'if it's good in hypertext would it be good on paper'
also stand out. I think, first, that "tinkertoys" is a very bad
word. There is absolutely no parallel with a "toy" because what we are
"playing with" not only has its origins in the bomb, but is redefining
commodity in our commodity culture. It's a social fact. It's not a toy
because, in the way that when the book was invented the first thing to
be published were laws and doctrines, the commodities of those days,
the book, hypertext, and computer-generation of text technologies are
NOT being invented for literature. When they say "the late age of
print" they are correct. Maybe it's not a factor in poetry production
as much but in terms of Boeing manuals, (increasingly) government
publications, bibliographic databases, etc., it IS a late age of print
(and thankfully so: those trees weren't very well used for these other
purposes). As to whether computers or computer-generation programs are
tinkertoys because they will become outmoded, I can only think of
automobiles. Many years ago I gave up a short-lived but valiant effort
to maintain my own vehicle. The main thought I ended up with was why
there were so many different parts for so many brands of cars and that
they were all different and all went in different places in the
car. It just didn't make sense. So likewise we will go through Windows
95, 96, 97, 98, 99, and on I presume. And nothing will ever fit. (Who
brought up CP/M? Was it Ron? Someone I'm sure is collecting Edsel
parts, right?) Yes that's also why (I think John mentioned this?) HTML
and SGML are breakthroughs--they are generic, common forms of
text. But of course, despite the fact that some autos even have rear
doors that fly off to considerable ill effect, they continue. So I
suppose that, if for the mainstream cycle of production and
consumption in the U.S., computers, like autos, have their place, they
too will continue. I wish there could be a clear focus on which aspect
of the subject we are talking about. Having a blurred line about the
word "tinkertoy" for example, and whether it's about hypertext or
computer-generation programs is like having a blurred line about the
word "sonnet" and whether it's about Ted Berrigan or Henry Howard,
Earl of Surrey. Is hypertext a technology that parallels the discovery
of the book? Obviously not. They are not parallel technologies. The
parallel is electronic textualities, which include distributed
networks, connections to remote databases, electronic information
delivery systems, such as the one we speak on. Now there's an argument
here that reading may be changing. As to would hypertext be the same
in print. Two answers: first, if we understand that it would only be
ONE sequence of choices, one path that was "frozen" on paper, then
yes, it should hold up on paper. Second, as a question to illustrate
the question, would this discussion on the list hold up on paper? (My
answer is it would not be interesting without considerable editing!
Though it's perfectly fine in its present medium.) Ron's proposition
does point to one very real fact: most hypertextual writing is awful!
Of course most writing in general is awful. (eg., been to a drug store
or airport lately ...) Though I do enjoy a good Boeing manual with a
1986 Pouilly Fuisse...
 
Perhaps the question is: are we are actually _reading_ hypertext
instead of wondering if it will work in a previous medium? Maybe
what's lacking is a serious reading of the work of (who would we
suggest?--now THIS is the interesting part!) Jim Rosenberg, John
Cayley, and who else? (I'd add my own __E__, soon to be issued in
RIF/T and available, in a special preview-for-members-of-this-
conversation version, through my author page in the EPC.) What about
some kind of short reading list here? (No Chris, don't worry. I mean
like--five items? The problem is that so many hypertext investigate
such different terrain. So maybe it's not a matter of the medium as
much as the terrain! (I mean, if a hypertext were about John Ashbery
or Susan Howe or Lyn Hejinian, would it matter if it was a
hypertext???)) So much hypertext tends to be ethereal, engaged with
the multiplicities of its technology and not grounded in language as
its own act. I really think about Charles Alexander's comment
here. The image of Chax's printing of Bernstein's "Four Poems" is
strong in my mind. I mean these four pieces, in the Chax edition, are
simply not the same as when transposed to a collection. Not that they
aren't "real" in the collection. I love 'em. But thank you Charles,
for the "reading" you gave me; it will always be alive at the ends of
my fingers and the way I had to unfold the overleaf to get at the
goodies inside...

Chris--
 
Certainly the good doctor bad insurance claims investigator (does anybody
out there remember Johnny Dollar on Saturday afternoon radio?!?) is just
silly.  I didn't say that though perhaps (?) Jonathan did.
 
I also think it's been shown (by Brook Thomas and Neil Schmitz and others)
that Walter Michaels is largely a perpetual motion machine driven by
tautology (all literature participates in its culture loop loop loop) but
it's still potentially interesting (to me, anyway) to note, sometimes w a
shock of surprise, how "insurgent" work is often most oddly embroiled in the
social structures it's aggressively rejecting just where it's most exciting.
And I'm persuaded by Bloom, and then in a different way by William James,
that Emerson is already busy doing a lot of what's most
exciting--poetically, intellectually--in Stevens' poetry, and that the
prodigious scholar in Stevens is an exciting trope and not just a fussy one.
And in Emerson, the formulation of a vision of imaginative power that powers
a lot of American poetry--up through Pound and Fenollosa and then wherever
you imagine that lineage to have fructified, to gesture at just one thread
out of many--is part of an argument, early on, in great essays like "The
American Scholar,"  that's agitatedly anti-capitalist.  But if it turns out
that just where Emerson is opposing the powers of the thinker or the poet to
the ways and means of the emerging economy, and just where he's saying the
things that will be so productive for future poetries, he's describing what,
with a small twist, would be just the thing he's opposing--well, that seems
like a good place to focus attention, though stopping with the assertion
that all supposed opposition is just a genteel tradition of liberal
handwringing that does no more than replicate what it bemoans is a sad place
to stop.  Since I don't WORK on Emerson, I mean I'm not gonna write on him,
I'm not sure of just where I'd want to go in this instance.  Quentin
Anderson's analysis in /Making Americans/ is one promising avenue, though
his Rx is too tied up in reveries of the heyday of the New York
Intellectuals to be very convincing.
 
Perelman is an interesting figure to bring up, I think (as Chris did) right
next to Stevens, since so much of a book like /Captive Audience/ takes
something like the inguistic leverage Cavell talks about Thoreau deploying
(in the early parts of /The Senses of Walden/) and shortens the length of
the lever.  That is, the space between current usage and the critical
resonance Bob lets us hear in "our" words is almost non-existent, but not
quite.  This might be mapped onto the conclusion of the Jameson /Pomo/ book.
(btw, that Charles B should so often deploy Cavell's "our" without quotation
marks is, to me, an odd and interesting, and troubling, move.)
 
Chris: since you mention the sort of conjuncture I brought up as akin to the
solipsism of a purely aestheticizing discourse: what's, for you, a happy
counter-instance?  What would be both more productive, and less solipsistic,
to say about Stevens, or Perelman?
 
best,

Subject:      Re: Hypertext & Poetry Possibilities
 
Concerning Jim Rosenberg's digression regarding concrete poets & Black Mountain
poets, etc., let me just say that it doesn't correspond at all to my memory
of all of that.  What I recall is a relative indifference back & forth, with
as much occasional hostility on one side as on the other & several notable
crossovers.  Remember too that most of the active concrete poets -- at the
height of that "movement" -- were European and Latin American, therefore at
a considerable remove from the activities of the New American Poetry.  In
all of my contacts there -- which were extensive -- I didn't pick up
anything of that sort and was much more aware of a kind of Black Mountain
dismissal of the concrete people as superficial or gimmicky or whatever.
The great crossover figure for me was Mac Low but there were others of us
too who found the presence of both of these forces (along with several more)
a matter of the greatest excitement in the 1960s and 70s.  My initial take
on Language Poetry was that it overplayed its connections to the New
American poetry & seemed oblivious to the experiments of concrete and
textsound poets & the promise offered by those.  Tht changed over the years
& all for the better, I think, but the culpability of the Concrete Poets
as such seems much too on-sided a view of the matter.
 
Otherwise, by the way, I think that Rosenberg's discussion of the hypertext
possibilities, etc. is exciting & (for me at least) enlightening.  How it
might be presented in a book as a part of the active poetic present (a
similar problem comes up with sound poetry like, e.g., Chopin's poesie
sonore) is something I'd like to see solved (if that's the right word) in
terms of the big-book project Joris and I are currently engaged with.

ps. You might note -- if it's an indication of anything -- that in Donald
Allen's updated New American Poetry (with its strong Black Mountain
emphasis) there was not a retrospective sign of anything vaguely approaching
concrete or visual or textsound poetry (among other omissions) -- which
looks to me like at least a mutual indifference.  But obviously concrete
never took hold in North America and if you narrow the field of poetry to
the U.S.A. alone, you're already eliminating (with a very few exceptions) the
genuine innovators & developers of all of that.  Anyway ...

Subject:      hypertext--media--baseballs
 
Looking for Homer's baseball?  I may want to retract this before it
bounces back on tomorrow morning's digest--but there is no baseball
in Homer; his persistance needs to be accounted for either by the
new equiptment accorded him in, say, Fitzgerald's translation...
or a cultural investment of 'believing in Homer's great baseball.'
 
Why is this anti-sports tone necessary?  It seems that as soon as
we start talking about a 'value' or 'quality' to a given poetry
which escapes the ravages of time or the transformations of its
media, we've dematerialized it completely.
 
Put pragmatically--what do we get by talking about the poem apart
from its versions: manuscript, drafts, first magazine publication,
small-press book version, electronic reprint, etc.?
 
Let's be blunt and/or reductive.
 
You can't have your baseball and eat it too!  Either 'good poetry
is platform independent' (baseball view) or 'there is no such
thing as the words themselves' (Charles A.)
 
The other problem I sense in talking about the somehow pure poetry
that 'comes through' *despite*... is that it seems necessarily
bound up with the recriminant notion that those poetries which
haven't made-the-cut must have lacked the 'pure poetry' that
would have shined through.

Subject:      visual poets
 
Jim Rosenberg's comments on the inflexibility of concrete poets, and that
such inflexibility and intolerance set the art of poetry back 20 years, just
seems wrong to me. Admittedly I was not terribly aware of visual poetry or
other innovative poetries until the mid-1970's, but from what I know it
seems that there was at least as much intolerance toward visual poetry as
there was intolerance coming from visual poetry. And when I think of poets
like Karl Young, bpNichol, Jackson Mac Low, Karl Kempton, Jonathan Brannen,
and others, I don't see much intolerance at all; rather, I see poets
practicing visual poetry among various strategies to expand the whole art. I
think if we ignore the visual poetry of these and others, we miss an
important part of late 20th Century poetry.
 
For a different view, a belief that poets engaged in various schools did NOT
set back the art 20 years, rather helped it continue forward, I quote from
Karl Young's essay, "Notation and the Art of Reading," in Open Letter vol.
5, no. 7, from the late 1970's, which will be part of his forthcoming book
of collected essays, Only As Painted Images Have We Come To Be In This
Place, which Chax Press will publish in 1996.
 
"At present there are at least twenty major schools of poetry functioning in
North America, each with dozens of subgenres. No group dominates, so poets
at the present time enjoy more freedom than they ever have in the past.
Members of some schools can be dogmatic and exclusionist, and members of one
clique can become extremely bellicose toward another coterie, but few, if
any, can limit their interests and contacts to members of their own groups.
Hence poets belonging to one clan can be influenced by members of another --
in fact, many poets switch allegiances during their careers, and many
function in several schools at once. The cross-fertilization among these
groups produces all sorts of hybrids, sometimes showing a great deal of what
biologists call hybrid vigor. We should note that what poets work against is
often as important as what they work with, and even antagonisms can be
productive. As well as producing hybrid vigor, interaction among schools
seems always to exert an influence on notation, keeping it from becoming
rigid or consistent, and opening up new possibilities."
 
While I admire the leaps into new worlds of visual possibilities of Jim
Rosenberg's work, I don't think it needs to come with a putdown of earlier
visual poetry, which, I think, has helped us rather than hindered us.

Subject:      Re: Hypertext & Poetry Possibilities
 
jerry, first off let me say (which i've posted backchannel to pierre) that
your and pierre's newly released anthology is an incredible achievement...
what i find intriguing is that you've managed in many ways to offer an
example of how to constructively alter the activity of anthologizing *even
as* jed's book emerges, a book that critiques past such efforts... striking
synchronicity here, methinks...
 
anyway, to cut to the chase:  i don't see how you'll manage a compilation
of electronic text in other than electronic form, just don't see it...
seems to me that there is surely a similar problem in translating various
print objects of art into a simpler, paper-bound medium... but the
electronic distinction is complicated not only by some fundamental changes
in reading e/affects (depending in part on one's, uhm, sensitivities), but
by, for example, the various platforms for which the text in question has
been designed/initially composed... to wit:  is reading the windows version
of _afternoon_ equivalent to reading the mac version?... is there any
subtle (or significant) difference here intrinsic to platform/front end, or
is this difference more constructively pursued as a function of differences
twixt mac/windows users/readers, which latter would imply perhaps a
slightly altered theory of reception?...
 
we tend not to talk about how we thumb through a given print manuscript (if
indeed we thumb through it!) but hitting the keyboard and clicking a mouse
are different activities (different from each other, that is), and
electronic texts can foreground this difference, too...
 
some tough conundrums here, and i'm sure i'm overlooking lots... but i'd
stick at least with the assertion that an anthology of (electronic!)
hypertext must be electronic...

according to L.A. Times, Don Cherry died at age 58 a few days ago --
Anybody who saw him perform recently (the only trumpet player i know of
in jazz to play from a lotus position!) knows how energetic and inventive
Cherry continued to be in the years after departing from the Ornette
Coleman band -- Once read poems with him at D.C. space between his sets
at the piano and trumpet -- a beautiful musician and a great friend to
all who knew him --

since Ron has now busted on me in public I may as well fess up -- I was
off the list from time to time lately 'cause I was playing in the series
-- Frustrated at my inability to break into the big leagues of poetry
book publishing, I've been moonlighting under a pseudonym for a ball team
-- The team at first seemed much more open to new talent than the world
of poetry, but now they've asked me to compose a "rap" for the team video
-- guess that was all they wanted me for all along --

re:  Don Cherry's death.
Sacrilege no doubt on the day after the conclusion of the World Series;
preface too to a Stormy Monday after this first day of Day Light Savings,
but. . .
Cherry died of liver cancer, one might say of not having access to
the repacement parts available to the Mick.
 
Don Cherry, Ornette Coleman, Ed Blackwell, Charlie Hayden are
still on recordings and YET to be appreciated.  The character of that
"yet" is manifold--prospective but not Emersonian.

CONFERENCES
 
 
 
SYMPOSIUM: (POST) COLONIAL FICTIONS: RE-READING ELIZA FRASER AND THE WRECK
OF THE STIRLING CASTLE.
 
University of Adelaide, 25-26 Nov., 1995.
 
Contact: Kay Schaffer, Department of Women's Studies, 08 303 5267 direct,
08 303 3345 FAX, e-mail: kschaffe@arts.adelaide.edu.au
 
Post-colonial studies within Australia have attempted to re-evaluate and
re- write colonial history to include those people either marginalised or
subjugated by the colonial process. This two day symposium will explore a
different aspect of post-colonial discourse through the exploration of one
of the best known events in Australian colonial history. In 1836 the
'Stirling Castle' was wrecked off the Queensland coast and many of the crew
together with the Captain's wife, Eliza, were marooned on Fraser Island.
Events surrounding the rescue of the castaways, in particular Mrs. Fraser,
received international media attention. In the last 160 years the story of
Eliza Fraser has become the subject of popular myth, fiction, opera, art,
film and scholarly research in the areas of cultural studies, literature,
history, anthropology, archaeology, women's studies, and the visual arts.
(Post) Colonial Fictions will examine critically the Eliza Fraser saga by
bringing together, for the first time, an interdisciplinary team of
academics, authors, artists and members of the Fraser Island community.
Discussions will include feminist analyses of the incident, textual and
iconographic representations of Aboriginal people, and Eliza Fraser as a
creative inspiration for the arts.
 
Speakers on 19th century ethnography, visual arts, and Fraser Island
history include: Ian Mc Niven, Lynette Russell, Rod McNeil, Olga Miller,
Elaine Brown; on 20th century cultural studies and Batdjala representations
include: Kay Schaffer, Sue Kossew, Jim Davidson, Jude Adams and Fiona
Foley. We are hopeful that the symposium will include an exhibition of
Fiona Foley's works and a performance by University of Adelaide
Conservatorium of Music students of the theatre opera: "Eliza Fraser Sings"
(arranged by Peter Sculthorpe/libretto by Barbara Blackman).
 
 
 
 
BECOMING AUSTRALIANS: THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS FEDERATION
IN BALLARAT AND THE NATION
 
December 1 and 2, 1995 Ballarat. Presented by the Australian Studies Team
University of Ballarat
 
Combining national with regional perspectives, this conference promises to
provide new insights into the social and political forces which influenced
the development of a sense of 'being Australians' in the years leading up
to and immediately following federation.
 
Organized by the Australian Studies Team at the University of Ballarat, the
conference aims to elucidate the many aspects of what it meant to be
Australian during this period, and how this in turn influenced the progress
of the federation movement.
 
The value and relevance of these historical concerns will be related to
current debates regarding citizenship, republicanism and Australian
political and cultural awareness.
 
Speakers include: Hon John Bannon, former Premier of South Australia and
author of The Crucial Colony: South Australia's Role in Reviving
Federation.. Professor Weston Bate, historian and author of a two volume
history of Ballarat. Professor Geoffrey Blainey, Chancellor of the
University of Ballarat and historian. Dr John Hirst, Reader in History at
LaTrobe University and author of A Republican Manifesto. Dr Helen Irving,
Reader in Politics at the University of Technology, Sydney and author of
the forthcoming To Constitute a Nation.. Hon Joan Kirner AM, former Premier
of Victoria and Chairperson of the Centenary of Federation Advisory
Committee. Professor Stuart Macintyre, of Melbourne University, who has
recently edited Alfred Deakin's account of federation.
 
Among those representing literary aspects of the conference will be: Dr.
Richard Jordan, Dr. Meg Tasker, and Rod Sadler, all of the University of
Ballarat.
 
The conference will also include a bus tour featuring Ballarat's Federation
Architecture.
 
Full registration (2 days)      $85

AUSTRALIAN STUDIES AND THE SHRINKING PERIPHERY: SURFING THE NET FOR AUSTRALIA.
 
The Centre for Australian Studies in Wales, University of Wales, Lampeter,
are hosting this conference next year. Organisers are calling for papers.
 
"In recent years the consolidation of Europe into the 15 states of the EU,
the integration of east and west within Europe, and the progressive turning
of Australia to its own Pacific backyard have furthered the impression of
periphery: one world's edge looking distantly at the other."

THE WHOLE VOICE
2nd National Conference on Poetry, 3-5 November 1995 University of Sydney
 
The Whole Voice Poetry Conference aims to bring together those with an
active interest in and involvement with poetry in Australia. The conference
is a national one and is a follow-up to "The Space of Poetry" conference
held at Melbourne University in 1993. It is being jointly organised by the
University of Sydney and the Poets' Union.
 
The 1995 conference will include poetry readings and papers from poets,
editors, academics and publishers. Poets reading include Judith Beveridge,
Laurie Duggan, Susan Hampton, J.S. Harry, Jill Jones, Donna McSkimming, Jan
Owen, Geoff Page, Margaret Scott, Andrew Taylor, and Richard Tipping.
Paper-givers include Peter Steele, Susan Hawthorne, Rosemary Huisman,
Christopher Kelen, Jeri Kroll, Martin Langford, and Max Richards. Richard
Allen and Karen Pearlman will present a performance of dance and poetry on
Friday evening and Richard Tipping, will co-ordinate a display of visual
poetry. These two events will present other views of the idea of "voice" in
poetry. There will also be time for open readings and discussion.
 
"The Whole Voice" theme was glossed as : "a poetry that speaks as fully as
possible, that allows the repressed to speak, that doesn't reject or
diminish emotion, intellect or craft." The organisers expect this position
to generate debate and creative argument, as the idea of "voice" is
contentious. "The practising writer's idea of voice is an intimate friend,"
comments a poet. "Voice is a literary construction, with all the historical
contingency which that implies," writes an academic. The very understanding
of "voice" is basic to dialogue between all participants.
 
Date: 3rd to 5th November 1995
Venue: Woolley Building, University of Sydney
 
Cost: Early Registration (by 22 Sept): $80; Full Registration $90
(Student/Unwaged: $45). Day Full Registration ($50, Day Student $25).

From:         Tom Beard <beard@MET.CO.NZ>
Subject:      Re: Where's the Hypertext in this Thread?
 
Loss gave an interesting summary of the hypertext (ht) poetry thread. I like
the healthy skepticism that he displays  - "most hypertext writing is awful!" -
and much of the most interesting writings on ht writing that I've seen on the
web (such as the "Search for some ht literature" (I've forgotten the author &
URL) and the article in FEED at http://www.emedia.net/feed/) has also been
skeptical. I know that I came towards ht with great enthusiasm, and I'm glad
that that has become tempered with some realism. Since then, I've written a
poem that _demanded_ a hypertext presentation, but I always make sure tham I'm
not writing (hype)rtext for its own sake.
 
The poem of mine that Eryque mentioned (thanks Eryque!) was originally written
on paper, but the structure became three dimensional and it was soon evident
that any paper version would "flatten" the poem and privilege certain
directions of reading over others. As it appears on the web (at
http://metcon.met.co.nz/nwfc/beard/www/notes27.html) each lexia/section/poemlet
allows the reader to move in one of six different directions, corresponding to
the six faces of a cube. My intention was for readers to construct their own
readings by reading/slicing/browsing/surfing through this 3D poem, and that
they should email me their readings to me so that I could include them on my
web pages along with the poem. This will-to-interaction faltered, however,
since no-one has sent me a reading yet.
 
The point of this is that this was a poem that did not work on paper, but did
in ht. Maybe I could have constructed something out of perpex or transparent
paper, but I have no space in which to exhibit such a work, and besides, I'm
happier writing HTML than doing manual labour. Perhaps there are some
interesting uses for ht-like structures in conceptual art or sculpture - I
dream of a vast, Hampton Court-style maze, with words embedded within the
living walls. It would be fascinating to track the paths that visitors/readers
take through this maze - perhaps the young would end up in a different part of
the maze to the old; or males and females would tend to take different tracks;
or those who have witnessed a parent die head straight towards the centre,
while people for whom English is a second language find the exit with great
rapidity, and those in unrequited love mill round and around in slowly-
diminishing circles.
 
Going back to why I agree with Loss over most ht-lit being awful, I must
qualify this by saying that I've only really read text-only works on the web: I
haven't tried anything based in Hypercard, and most of the interesting work by
people like Jim Rosenberg & Eduardo Kac won't talk to my little VT-320. Also,
until recently most ht-lit on the web was by people who were programmers first
and writers second, and this showed. I have no doubt, however, that ht shows
_great_ potential for experimental multi-linear narratives. I'm not sure
whether poetry will have as great a potential for ht experimentation, for
reasons that I will try to explain.
 
For a start, most contemporary poetry has no narrative, or at least not in the
linear sense of conventional fiction, so there is no expectation of story-line
to be subverted. There are exceptions, such as epic poetry or stories in verse,
but in language-centred writing as well as in much lyric poetry, we cannot
allow the reader to choose "what happens next", since there is no "next".
 
We could write poems in which words are highlighted, and clicking these words
will take us to different parts of the poem. This is "associative" ht, as
opposed to "plot-based" ht, and it is an interesting possibility. But this is
how I tend to read most poetry anyway, and I've argued
(http://metcon.met.co.nz/nwfc/beard/www/sargeson_ladder.html) that _all_ text
can be read as hypertext in this sense. Even a relatively conventional text can
be read in this way, with words sending the mind racing down links of meaning
and sound, both within the poem and with "pointers" to other texts. This is
truly non-linear reading, as opposed to the "multilinear" reading that someone
so rightly pointed out was the true characteristic of ht. At least with HTML-
style ht, a reader follows one link at a time, whereas reading a poem on the
page can generate a ghostly web of links, existing simultaneously and at
different levels of consciousness, across the poem. It sounds like Jim R's
approach, with superimposed words, may be an incarnation of this idea, and I
wish I had the hardware to view it.
 
Perhaps the most promising creative uses of hypertext will not be in poetry, or
fiction, or criticism; but in modes that have not previously existed. Some of
my favourite web examples of this are OutThere(TM) at
http://www.umich.edu/~rmutt/OT/ (a hypertext non-glossary of Dada, Surrealism
etc; a satirical "Form without Function"; and the homepages of Procrustus Corp,
"brokers of fine intellectual property", sprinkled with extensions to HTML such
as <TASTEFUL> and <HYPNOTIZE>), The E-Ville Dialogs at
http://www.itp.tsoa.nyu.edu/~shana/Dialogues/contents.html (the reader
eavesdrops on philosphical discussions among the diners at a Greenaway-esque
restaurant, trying to talk to the Head Chef, Heraclitus - the overall feel is
somwhere between Kafka and _The Prisoner_) and the Giovanni Bottesini project
at http://www.webcom.com/~redwards/gbmain.html (a mock-historical archive which
makes fine use of layered possibilities - Bottesini has 7 reported dying
sayings, each of which leads the reader on a different track - and reminds me
of Umberto Eco with its conspiracy theories and pseudo-scholarship).
 
Hypertext could also allow for some new forms of critique, with a critic adding
links to a work to make explicit some linkages that were hidden in a linear
text, or creating a hyper-detournement by weaving ht-links between several
diverse texts. It also gives the editors of electronic journals the opportunity
to add both internal and external links to their publications, thereby
expanding the works. Of course, the individual authors should have some veto on
this - I wouldn't like my poems to sprout blue underlined links without my
approval - but there's merit in having a poem that quotes John Cage and alludes
to _The Piano_ accompanied by a subtle selection of links to a John Cage home
page and the Internet Movie Archive's entry on _The Piano_. The Web itself is
the greatest hypertext poem yet written.

Subject:      return to the tinkering
 
Loss' post calls for a thorough response; I'm afraid I'll just tinker away
at it.  Fact of the Net's dark origins granted--this may be all the more
reason to invoke the playful, insisting that we do toy around, and
that toying is meaningful.
 
Which reminds me of the discussions on 'experimental' some months ago.
I find a value in insisting that one 'toys' around or 'experiments'
because I don't look for poems that act as proof-texts of some
prior seriousness--itself potentially dangerous, no?
 
On a different note, it does seem that one of the elements absent
from the hypertext wing of this discussion is the way that, online
atleast, it involves more than non-linear or interactive writing.
These are (as someone, Tom Beard?) mentioned, attributes of
particular interest to writers of narrative.
 
Increasingly I grow interested in using the multi-media aspect of
electronic writing.  The ability to create and distribute visual
and sound poetry, 'intermedia' (in Dick Higgins' term) compells
my recent writing more than those formal features most typically
associated with hypertext.
 
In this sense, I'd want not only to blur the boundary between
computer generated writing and hypertext (non-sequential writing)
but also that between writer and programmer.  The word has had little
time encrust itself with romantic resonance, but 'programmer'
might be another word for the work Charles Alexander and others
do with the letter press book!

Subject:      Visual Poetry
 
Visual poetry goes way back--to Alexandria in ancient times, and poets
such as Simias who did shaped poems. Then with printing in the
Renaissance the typographical arrangement could involve all sorts of
degrees of originality. I think the early-twentieth-century emphasis
(in the poetry of H. D. and Pound, the criticism of Hulme, poetry of
Williams, cummings, etc) was in part a reaction against those
late-nineteenth-century volumes jammed margin to margin with Idyls of
the King or dramatic monologues.
 
May Swenson is certainly the best visual poet of the second half of
this century--because her poems are also auditory, and because the
visual effect is arranged rather than deranged.
 
Visual poetry seems to coincide with other kinds of revolution or
experimentation--and is scorned by prosodic conservatives, who become
uncomfortable in their scorn when reminded of George Herbert.

Subject:      Re: Where's the Hypertext in this Thread?
 
a friendly addendum to tom beard's fine post:
 
tom, i would only say, as i've been saying for a good while now, that the
fact that hypertext doesn't violate the episodic, linear structure of
narrative when it comes to much contemporary poetry is *precisely* the
reason i find it of great significance to what poets can do with same (and,
as in the case of a few folks on this list, *are* doing)... perhaps one
loses the sort of inherent contrapuntal texture that transgression of
narrative-episodic form provides, but what takes its place, depending on
what's actually writ(-composed), is the possibility of rather startling
associative leaps unencumbered by 'plot' as such... (my own preference is
in fact for an anti/metaphysics of place, but this is a whole 'nother
matter)...
 
in general, i think the concept of hybridity (informed perhaps by recent
a-a and postcolonial critical work on same) is a useful way to begin to
rethink the sorts of aesthetic experiences you suggest in various of the
web sites you mention (and thanks for that list, too!)...

Nope, /pace/ all the well-meaning and light-hearted suggestions that it's
good for us to 'go back to' using toys for a while to regain some sort of
'primitive' or 'childlike' naivety in relation to our art (I love to play,
although *not* with computers), I just can't let 'tinkertoy' slip through
as potentially useful characterization of 'programmed machines as
presentors/generators of (some) poetic writing'.
 
Especially, not for the reason that what we use now will (inevitably) be
outmoded tomorrow. The technology of the book has evolved, and *many* book
technologies have been outmoded. The Chinese classics were written on
(amongst other things) strips of bamboo bound together with string
(producing, btw, some interesting quasi-aleatory ethical philosophy when
early editions were dug up with the strings rotted away), they were also
carved on stones (some argue this was *after* the aforementioned
quais-alearoy transformations) which still stand in a 'forest of Stones' in
Xi'an -- multilithic, difficult to use, but not outmoded (you can still
take rubbings).
 
But enough of this playing around, the reason the question of obsolescence
is obsolete is because of the computer-based medium we're using now. It's a
mistake to consider 'some one type of computer running some one piece of
software' as a soon-to-be-abandoned toy, because now all of these systems
are linking themselves together and it won't be long before most (local)
computer-based activity is transparent to the network, regardless of
platform/software etc.
 
My conclusion: nothing of significance (I mean the stinging together of
beautiful/good language, the design and creation of new cyber/hypertextal
forms and systems of text regeneration) that you are doing now with your
computer will be 'outmoded'. You will, sooner rather than later, be able to
make it accessible to others.

Programming time: What it seems to me that a poet/+programmer *can* do is
allow a reader to experience a poet's syllable time. Perhaps this also
happens when you simply listen to a recording of a poet performing her
work. But I've always be particularly interested in silent reading, and the
screen, potentially, allows us to experience a rendition of a 'scored'
syllable time in the silent reading of a poem.
 
That said, I mentioned before that I had written a HyperCard stack that
allows you to 'score' poems in this way. Jim wrote about his 'tape loop'
experiment and his surprise at the illusion of simultaneity that the
dominance of stress over musical attack produced. In trying to make the
'scoring' stack I was (and still am) amazed at the fine control required to
'score' words and phrases in a manner that matches my inner ear. HyperCard
(with my current hardware) really isn't up to it. (Ah ha! they all cry -- a
tinkertool...) E.g. I make words appear letter by letter (as if scrolling
rightwards) and allow the speed at which this is done to be adjusted. But
to represent stress properly, you would probably have to have variable
speeds of letter display *within* the presentation of single words (v.
difficult and v. time consuming -- but I'll work on it). However, such
super-sensitivity apart, if you got the time/pause relationships right
(over one screen's worth of text) then the fragment suddenly seems to
click, to work for the inner ear -- ?? like Jim's tape loop phenomenon.
 
[Programming an other time: _The Speaking Clock_ addresses the question of
names for time; the suggestion that a clock should give a different name to
every moment, since every moment of *real* time is different.]

I think you *can* have and eat your baseball.* I've heard, from colleagues

south China and that there are no local taboos against killing and eating

hold and eat our baseballs in cyberspace. (Also, isn't there a very good
Japanese pitcher doing well in the major leagues? With a really

john's _the speaking clock_ is (again my spockish declaration of late)
fascinating... one of the beauties of this medium is that john was able to
email me his work, from london, within twenty-four hours of my request...
and i had it up and running in about two minutes...
 
mind you, he won't receive my check for mebbe five-seven days, airmail...
 
(it's on its way, john, thanks again!              (((does this guy have
faith in me, or what?...
 
anyway:
 
i think this discussion of ht and electronic form suggests, not so
surprisingly, a conjuncture (a helpful one) in the arts:  that moment when
art---understood by its various communities in terms of its various
practices---finds itself once again (a historical assertion) implicated in
its various technologies AS SUCH... and with a bit of luck, i hope,
technology begins itself to show signs of this, uhm, interfacing...
 
hence we're at the intersection of multiple discourses... hence i want to
introduce the term 'instrumentalist' here (in line with certain theorists
of technology) to indicate that a view toward technology as a tool, as
something we have control over, is generally used to argue in fact that
technology only reinforces dominant, status quo realities... b/c in this
view, technology is a tool (as my students here at the technical institute
tend always to gloss it) "nothing more and nothing less"... hence the
question posed by audre lorde, to wit, how to use the 'master's tools' to
rebuild the 'master's house,' becomes a difficult question indeed...
 
there are other ways of thinking about tools (where's don byrd?), but what
i offer in this latter is the more restrictive sense of the word...
 
now among the various other views of technology, there is the view afforded by
folks like (and for) foucault (say that five times quickly) that technology
is in fact NOT a tool... that it is a far more epistemic construct, and
that we don't exactly 'use' it to produce a desired end product... we
don't, that is, 'control' it---in fact quite the opposite... hence we end
up with the more dire discourses on technology, and the the more luddite
responses to same...
 
in these views, as i've articulated them, the possibility of bringing about
constructive change through technological practice is complicated by either
(1) difficulty in transcending the after-the-significant-fact, make it
OLD/'fix it' role assigned to tools or (2) inability to control a
totalizing (not to say totalitarian) set of practices marked by their
self-replication in capitalist commodity culture...
 
i'm pointing to these two views of technology to suggest a third view (and
fourth, etc):  that if techology is from one pov a tool (yes, it can pretty
much reduce to this, depending on how one construes context) and if
technology is from another pov a set of cultural practices (yes, it can be
this in macro terms, depending again on on how one construes context), then
methinks there is certainly room in this continuum to consider ALL
technologies both as things AND as (social) events (maria damon may want to
jump in here with her notion of the 'margin')...
 
things would include toys, screwdrivers, human beings, hypertexts,
baseballs and global information and control systems...
 
events would include heightened awareness, mindwashing, human beings,
tripping (both senses), striking out and FUN...
 
the instrumentalist concept *tends toward* things (as means to ends), the
epistemic concept *tends toward* events (as mutually contingent
'shapeshifting' processes)... but there are no hard & fast boundaries here,
save to the extent one is attached to one's categories...
 
just some non-inklings, all a bit sloppy and unpolished, high in fiber, and
mebbe not too difficult to digest...

To each her or his own. I don't know about "best visual poet," but I think I
would choose any of the trio of bpNichol, Karl Young, or Karl Kempton. And
this is limiting myself to North America, where in some ways visual poetry
is under-represented, or at least under-recognized. But I find the
explosiveness and sheer inventiveness of Nichol and Young amazing in their
sweep of possibilities. And I find the subtle patterns of Karl Kempton,
based on sources which range from patterns of plankton on the shore to Hopi
and other tribal weavings, to be rich and deep in a way which moves me more
than Swenson's work. Not that there's anything wrong with her work, which is
an important body of work.
 
I also think there are a number of important book artists who should be seen
as visual poets in a kind of Blakean tradition; these would include Susan
King, Patricia Scobey, Nancy Leavitt, and others.
 
all best,

Charles--yes. Thanks for your response (and thanks, Ron). Anybody else
have ideas how to hold readings that are a) pleasant b) productive c)
surprising? Any successful hosts (don't be bashful!) who would
like to share their secrets for inviting readers (and please don't point to

whether they'd be interested in reading... St. Marks has a "two-year
rule" (can't have a solo reading two years in a row)... what are the
rules elsewhere, such as SPD? Are there people you've wished would read
but just never do? Are there people you wish just wouldn't read
(did you know that the expression "backchannelling" comes from the noises
and movements a listener makes to acknowledge that they've been
listening?)? Is a query like this ironically more likely to keep people
from discussing a troublesome issue than to provoke change?

   Dear Ed---
   Could you please elaborate, or support your argument (gosh, i feel
   like i'm grading a student paper) about "different poetries" being
   "different economies"---Do you mean "psychic economies" and if so
   how is that NOT a trope? If you mean the COST of books, or the LABOUR
   involved in reading a certain poet, is there a way to determine what
   is the MOST COST-EFFECTIVE poetry? Hmmmm--the kind of poetry that has
   5 words per page is more "taxing" than maximialism? The kind of poetry
   that works good on a first reading but not as much on subsequent ones
   is certainly a ripoff? (This is all very vague). If some poetry DEMANDS
   more from the reader than others (how do you define demand?), is it
   possible it doesn't DRAIN the reader but actually stirs the reader
   to an activity s/he wouldn't otherwise.
   Please, Ed, tell me more--I am quite open to this---
   But I also am skeptical about the validity of what seems to me to be
   a kind of quantification here--It's like sleep.
   Why is it, for instance, that sometimes I am MORE tired when I
   have just woken from a 12 hour sleep than i am when I have woken from
   a 3 hour nap? (I don't expect you to answer that....) Chris S.

I suspect that value judgements "are" as you say a subterfuge, a conspiracy
game, designed to establish one's value system as the first system to be
consulted in the event of any value judgement. It is implemented is
through substitution of first person plural in discussing
issues that are only valid in the first person singular. It can also
be accomplished, although less effectively with the Royal WE. Shifters as
McCaffery points out are the arbiters of value. The language game that is
played out here is an attempt to establish a universal context for a
particular context. There is a strong psychological component too.
 
And we can't help it. It is simply a matter of asserting ourselves. I am
just astonished how little else there is in our exchanges. When I was
first moving in a public poetry world, days were spent, days, listing our
pantheons of poets, as we got older we substituted books by poets, then we
substituted poems, then contracts, then diseases. These lists are too
evaluative. What I wanted to have accomplished is substitution of an
analysis for a value judgement, but the psychology of the poet is too
fragile in a weak culture to let writers be free of the need to
continually have their values reaffirmed.
 
I don't think there is any way to stop it short of addressing issues and
that presents its own problems. Even as I type I'm sure I'm engaged in
a form of the same. Let us look like we're doing the rightthing by doing
the wrong thing. Let us cut the budget.

I'll stand corrected on this, but my basic point remains:  whoever was
responsible, real *dialogue* in poetics between visual poetics and other
forms -- sound too, for that matter -- has been woefully insufficient, and we
must do what we can to increase it.

Oh dear.  Charles, you misunderstood me *COMPLETELY*.  There was no putdown
intended against visual poetry -- the exact opposite.  What I am speaking
against is exactly the lack of interchange.  It is from a belief in the
*value* such a dialogue would have that I bemoan its absence.
 
Yes, there have been many "crossover" figures, as both Jerry and Charles
point out.  But in our *discourse* I find precious little attention to this
cross-fertilization.  If hypertext folk end up talking only to other hypertext
folk it will be a sad sad day.

want to add the names of Russell Atkins and Norman H. Pritchard to the
recent lists of visual and concrete poets, which was starting to look
like some kinda whitelist or something --Look at Kevin Young's article on
Pritchard in the _Harvard Library Bulletin_ 3.2 1992, which volume (on
material poetry) also includes an essay of note by Marjorie Perloff.

Joe Amato,
 
While I agree with your attempts to define "technology" as both variously
instrumentalist and epistemic, I have a problem that arises from such an
attempt--which is, that if we broaden "technology" too much then the term
becomes watered down and useless.  For instance, I am very much taken
with my colleague (by the way, he is the editor of the new Eco-Journal
TERRA NOVA, which prints poetry and all other manner of beast, and he can
be contacted at NJIT, Newark, NJ 07102 or email him at:
rothenberg@admin.njit.edu) and his ideas especially as they are expressed
in his recent book HAND'S END: TECHNOLOGY AND THE LIMITS OF NATURE, but
in the book he argues that language itself is a technology--whereas, like
Ong or Bolter I guess, I would draw the line at writing.
 
But I know what you mean. . . .

All I know about the Orono Conference is that it is on Poetry of the 1950s.
The conf dates are 6/19-23/95.
 
Contact Burton Hatlen

From what I hear, the conference will be a real thrill, but what I hear is

Yes, I do think I misinterpreted you. Just so we realize there are as many
open minds among visual poets as among non-visual poets, hypertext poets,
etc. Yes, interchange, dialogue, is at stake.

perhaps in this direction, chris: that the profit motive encourages value
based on perception so that the object (and e.p. had a field day on this
one) can become more or less valuable depending on the way it is understand.
excuse me: i mean "understood" but this foolish computer does not permit
revision. and this replaces the older (and to my mind, more attractive)
concern with the essential. in poetry (and the link is real, a move from
one economy to another) there is a shift from the noun to the verb, that
obsession among so many now, that in american literature emerges so strongly
with emerson. olson, disliking emerson, found older roots in heraclitus.
the essential in this, as in (to take the extreme) laissez faire economics,
is change; the man said, "What does not change / is the will to change," but
that really implies an unchanging "i." in fact the only thing that doesn't
change is change. (indeed you buy something and get change.) the difference
between, say, the poetics of the era of augustus, say, and whitman is linked
to different economies. so, too, wallace and ezra. that does not mean that
poetry is political, but that there are common roots. there is every reason
to argue against althusser, but one could draw on his definition of ideology
here--that which cannot be resisted. and that, in the realm of insurance
(what value do you give your house/life/job) and wallace's supreme fiction,
is essentially (sorry, but that really is the word) alchemical. -ed

Jordan:
 
I personally like readings which break out of the "reader-break-reader"
format.  A few years back I saw John McNally and Darin DeStefano read at
Small Press Traffic, and they both went up to the front and traded poems
back and forth for an hour or so, ending with a two-voice reading of Kenward
Elmslie's "Girl Machine."  It was brilliant.  Recently I read with Anselm
Berrigan and John M., and we each read solo for ten minutes apiece, then
read together for a half-hour.  Another format I've used is to alternate
readers with musical acts.  Clark Coolidge and David and Tina Meltzer did us
one better, though, by combining these approaches.  David and Clark would
each read, then they'd break out the drums and guitar and back Tina, then
one would solo over the other reading, then they'd trade poems to and fro.
That was really lively.
 
Not that the "regular" way isn't fine, but to vary that routine reinvests it
with an energy that sometimes flags if things get too "samey."
 
One of the tricks to booking a series (although this may depend on the
series) that might not be too obvious is not to overbook.  If you leave some
space in your schedule then you'll have a night for (your favorite poet's
name here) to read when she tells you, "Hey, I'll be in town in 6 weeks.
Anything going on?"  Although you want to balance this with the desire not
to always be finalizing dates at the last possible minute, which makes
getting the word out to your audience more difficult.

Jordan, On the matter of the readings issue, Bev Carver and I have been
doing a series at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts for about nine years.
One novelty item that we include every few months (we put on monthly
programs each year from about September until May) is to select a particular
visual arts exhibition that's on display.  We select from that show several
pieces that we invite specific people to respond to (NOT INTERPRET!) with a
new text.  On the night of performance, the audience is guided from piece to
piece (sculpture, painting, etc.), at which we make a stop.  The education
director from the center staff shares some information about the visual
artist, the work; we then introduce the writer, who reads the new piece.
The audience benefits from having at least two senses working at once.  This
format tends to offer very stimulating possibilities and is consistently
popular.

Subject:      the Hypertextual possibilities
 
 I must say that in reading George P. Landow's _Hypertext: The Convergence
 of Contemporary Critical Theory and Technology_ (Johns Hopkins UP) I've
  found it fascinating on one level, and quite redundant (and not in a
 negative sense of the word, no offense to George or friends of George)
 on another level. The fascinating things about this text are:
 
1) the implications of hypertextual linkin' 'n thinkin' in terms of
say _power_ structures (he does begin his print culture text with
a quote from Foucault), the availability and the production of hieratic
(interesting sections on hieroglyphs) and hierarchical modificatiions,
 
2) the seeming _break_ within the linearity of the "text" (as we used to
term it) that hypertext (now, hypermedia) produces or enables--in terms of
some cultural conceptions of what constitutes an "author",
 
3) Landow's ideas of the convergence of say, Derridean notions of inter-
weaving/excesses (within writing) with _contemporary_ hypertextual/media
constructions...Landow believes that the hyper-world has enabled the
previous structuralist and post-structralist discourses to become better
understood (whereas before, these theories were somehow arcane systems of
mystified knowledge)...the hyper-world, that is, via modes of Web linkages,
non-linear directories, etc. seems to explain or elucidate these po/struct.
theories _naturally_...(on a monitor of course).
 
Landow quotes Walter J. Ong (_Orality and Literacy_) and I feel this
directly relates to the issues of power, who _owns_ a text, who _knows_
a text, and of course, the possibility of _challenging_ the text:
 
"The author might be challenged if only he/she could be reached, but the
author cannot be reached in any book. There is no way directly to refute
a text. After absolutely total and devestating refutation, it says exactly the
same thing as before. This is one reason why 'the book says'is popularly
tantamount to 'it is true'. It is also one reason why books have been burnt.
A text stating what the whole world knows is false will state falsehood
forever, so longas the text exists."
 
What does this mean for hypertext, virtual networks, the WWW, and more to
come...etc etc.?
 
Perhaps, the redundant aspectd of this body of lexia _Hypertext_, seem
to be the under-development of certain concepts, yet in the converse,
certain ideas are brought about repetitively. The notion of "non-linearity"
and the multiplicity of authorship, for examples, (regarding hypertextual
models) are repeated throughout the work, in almost every chapter.
When one reads these concepts over and over, it appears to be an ironic
commentary on the nature of computer replication itself (or print culture
textual reproduction), as well as a Barthes-ian idea of reproducion or
inscription. For Landow praises Barthes' _S/Z_ for Barthes' pre-cyber
understandings of "linking", "nodes", "networks", "webs" and "paths":
 
Landow cites from _S/Z_, "In this ideal text, the networks [reseaux]
are many and interact, witout any one of them being able to surpass the
rest; thistext is a galaxy of signifiers, not a structure of signifieds;
it has no beginning; it is reversible; we gain access to it by several
entrances, none of which can be authoritatively declared to be the main
one; the codes it mobilizes extend _as far as the eye can reach_, they
are indeterminable...;the systems of meaning can never take over this
absolutely plural text, but their number is never closed, based as it is
on the infinty of language".
 
Again, like the Internet? Or hypertextual mediums?
Although Landow repeats, he may just be attempting to _come at the text_
through several different angles or entranceways--thus, modeling his
text on that of the hypertext as well as Barthes' _S/Z_, I'm not entirely
sure. This dilemma might rest within an argument of form vs. function.
 
And I agree that there are differences between traditional _text_
and hypertext and Landow does talk a bit about the Hypercard program
"by opening the text-processing program [Hypercard], or editor, as it is
known, you can take notes, or you can write against my interpretations,
against my text. Although you cannot change my text, you can read the
readerly text in two ways not possible with a book.." In a sense, the
"discussion list" (computerized) is just such an example of _reading
against the text_...the idea that Landow is attmpting to put on the
virtual table.

Hi Jordan.
 
Here at the Poetry Center at SF State the rule is once every five years
unless someone wins our book award (a reading is part of the award.) One  thing
I've noticed after helping to run this series
forever is that it can be useful to have a short exchange between the
writers after the reading. If you combine scenes, as Ron suggested, this
can help to make a bridge. We call it a conversation, they more or less
interview each other. A recent one between MichaelPalmer and Norma Cole
produced the question to Michael from Norma: people most often ask me
about you - when did you stop dancing? Of course such an exchange could
degenerate into a fight, but then that would be great. As a final thing,
a sound system can be good, many readings in cafes and bars are just
barely audible.
