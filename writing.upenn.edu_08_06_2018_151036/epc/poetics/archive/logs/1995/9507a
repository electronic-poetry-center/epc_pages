Burt -- It's been 15 years literally since I've been in the Fuller
literature (I think I told the story publicly that doing the dictionary
of his thinking was when I knew I should go to graduate school, and once
I did I never went back).  But it seems to me it's in the opening of
SYNERGETICS.  I frankly no longer have my own materials on hi8m -- only
the books.  Why not go through indexes for "writing" "alphabet" "paper"
(seems to me he said something extremely interesting about the fact that
everyone always ignored the surface, the paper, when they thoughht about
writing).
If you find anything, please share it!

Or, hey, post the question on the Buckminster Fuller list that I seem to
have just joined out of curiosity.... want the address?

Meow Press (Joel Kuszai's inventive imprint) has recently published, as a
Meow Press Textbook, TECHNOLOGY/art: 20 Brief Proposals for Seminars on Art
& Technology. These brief proposals were made in 1984 by a group of poets
(Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, and James Sherry), at the request of
Jesse Ausubel, who was then Director of Programs at the National Academy of
Engineering, to increase the dialogue between artists and scientists and
engineers. It was this book which provoked my recent consideration of the
alphabet as a technology.
 
But thanks for giving me credit, Maria. And the responses provoked of more
ways to look at the art/technology nexus through the writings of a variety
of women have been most welcome.

Sandra Braman, thanks for the notion to look at B. Fuller for comments on
the paper, the "surface" of writing. That appeals to me particularly as a
bookmaker who seems to talk widely about the context of the text, in my
case mostly about the physical contexts of representation. So, yes, I will
find SYNERGETICS and look for remarks on paper. And, if you send the
address of the fuller list, I may put a query there.
 
Are you still coming to Minneapolis this summer? Can we still get together?
 
all best,

The modernist focusses on her/his purity, ignoring others' responses,
is loved as unreachable by non-experts eg non-poets for a modernist
poet, non-musicians for a modernist musician, or found intense by
fellow experts - and oneself by oneself by the same logic. But there
is always the need for the "feminine" reader who can see how the
freedom to have time to listen and read and create is endangered and
must be fought for, as a social space (eg Harryman saying she loves
polemicists but can't herself be one as is too busy looking at all
the whole picture, faux polite sarcasm?). You have an intense evening
or year with Bach and feel the fullness not just of Bach as an object,
but of the time he could/did steal to make so much art, of having all
that time to appreciate it - like Joyce responded, it should take you
a lifetime to read Ulysses, it took me a lifetime to write it - but
then maybe it is easier to read something after its author's death,
just because of all sorts of reasons, prime perhaps the socially
required (it seems) need to tease the person who's really ahead while
alive. You have that intense evening or year, then you say "it's human,
albeit a brave human, who can feel like this; many more could if there
were fewer frighteners put on people for them to have to be brave in
defiance of"; and you stop making art and make utopia nearer.
        What kind of utopia, to not be a modernist yourself; to be modern,
not postmodernist either. What Derrida's work does is place itself in this
problem of wanting to, and being hugely sensitively able to, make or
teach art and philosophy; and yet wanting to express this as forever
deferred, while you get on with not becoming the freak who got through
the frighteners, and is personally ok, but instead remind people that you
aren't especially special, everyone's special, and there's too many
frighteners.

Subject:      Geoffrey Hill/Modernism & PoMo in England
 
I was intrigued when, in response to a mention of John Ashberry's exam question
comparing an Ern Malley poem to that of a modernist, someone replied "it wasn't
even a modernist, it was Geoffrey Hill". Is there a box into which Hill's
poetry can be slotted? He doesn't seem exactly modernist to me (although Ira's
remark that "The modernist focusses on her/his purity, ignoring others'
responses" could be applied to him), and not postmodernist either.
 
This seems a general problem with English poets - the easy categorisation into
a modernist/postmodernist tradition that appears less problematic when
considering  American poetry seems to break down for post-war English poetry
(of course, this is a problem with the categorisation rather than with the
poets). Although they followed modernism chronologically, would anyone
categorise the Movement or Group poets as postmodern? It seems rather that
they've taken the MacSpauday strand of modernism and developed a kind of anti-
modernism, whereas the US took the Pound strand and turned it into what most
would categorise as PoMo.
 
Perhaps postmodernism is an American/European phenomenon, and England (& hence
the Commonwealth) has been left with a more traditional mainstream. In New
Zealand, the boundaries are blurred a little by the fact that many 'amateur'
poetry-lovers complain of the prevalence of what they see as postmodernism in
the journals, when they're really talking of a kind of 'post-Manhirism'
practised by Borholdt/Johnston/Wilkins/Orsman and so on. These poets seem to me
to bear the same relationship to postmodernism as Auden or perhaps Larkin did
to modernism - the experiments of an older generation have been absorbed and
domesticated. Auckland poets such as Michele Leggott, Alan Loney and Wystan
Curnow are perhaps closer to what people on this list would see as
postmodernists, and the mainstream journals seem a little wary of their work
(viz Jane Stafford's review of Leggott's _DIA_ and Murray Edmond's _The
Switch_).
 
I'm not sure where this leaves me. I started writing poetry in Wellington,
where Bill Manhire is seen as God, and I still have a tremendous admiration for
much of his poetry, but moving to Auckland and joining this list have given me
some idea of what LangPo and postmodernism have to offer. I still think it's
best to read as widely as possible, not restricting oneself to one particular
movement or genre. Leigh Davis, Edwin Morgan, Dinah Hawken, Craig Raine, Karl
Stead, Cilla McQueen, Wallace Stevens, Dennis Lee, Ian Wedde and T.S. Eliot
have all left their traces in me. I've never dared to try writing like Geoffrey
Hill, but his writing moves me immensely. I hope that there will always be room
for poets who span or fall between the boundaries.
 
        Tom.

INTRODUCTION
 
WELL, WELL, WELL.  Happy Birth Day, ACT UP, and Many
Happy Returns of the Day!
 
The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power has just begun to flex its
muscles.  We are all beginning to feel better in the reflection of your
struggle against AIDS.  Although you may sometimes feel like the
little boy whose thumb in the dike is all that stands between the next
breath and the deluge, your supporters gain courage by your example.
 
AIDS, like the pestilences before it, has been used as a principle of
division --division between genders, between the races, between the
nations and the continents.  But it has backfired, and the struggle
against it brings us greater power than we knew, for we are
beginning to understand that there is not a single question of
struggle that is not involved in yours.  The struggle against sex and
racial discrimination, the struggle of workers at our places of
employment, the struggle for civil liberties, the struggle for housing,
the struggle to chose our own life-style, the expression of solidarity
with those struggling in Africa, in Haiti, in the Philippines, and in
Latin America, the struggle against medicine-for-profit, the struggle
for education, the struggle for prisoners' rights, the struggle against
identity papers, the struggle to sleep when, where, and with
whomever, the struggle to retain some of the breakthroughs of the
1960s to create our own forms of sociality, the struggle against drug
abuse, the struggle for gay liberation, the struggle for women's
liberation, the struggle for the environment, the struggle for science
for the people, the struggle for sex and the struggle for safe streets,
have gained strength from your vigilance, creativity and staying
power.
 
Here is a birthday present.  It is a history of ten plagues.  It contains
warnings and danger signals.  It shows us how far we have come.
It is a collective present which could not have been written without
the help of Michaela Brennan, Silvia Federici, George Caffentzis,
Evan Stark, John Wilshire, Monty Neill, Nancy Kelly, Bettina
Berch, Harry Cleaver, John Roosa, Kate Linebaugh, and all the
"whores, sluts and martyrs" who supped on minestrone last Friday
beyond midnight.
 
So, as they say in San Francisco, "let us go gayly forward".
 
HIV made its active appearance in the late 1970s in the United
States.  At the same time, in Chicago, an economic theory was
propagated ("monetarism") that organized poverty, famine, disease,
and dislocation all over the world in the interests of the ruling
classes whose corrupt desperation was personified by an aphasic
actor, Ronald Reagan.  Chicago also became a center noted for the
adoption of free-market economic models to the interpretation of law
(Stephan Possner) which ceased to pretend to justice and quantified
instead the cost-benefit of life and death, and such jurists gained
political ascendancy.  Not long after, under the barking leadership of
William Bennett, other dogs of the liberal arts joined the howling
chorus for "Western Civilization".  A Chicago historian, William
McNeill, published PLAGUE AND PEOPLES in 1979, shortly
before the AIDS pandemic appeared.
 
He takes a long view, indeed the longest view he can, beginning
with "Man the Hunter" and placing "him" within a very deterministic
ecology.  He notes that our survival is contingent upon survival
against micro parasites which inhabit our bodies (bacteria, viruses)
and against macro parasites (ruling classes in their many mutations)
who raid, enslave, exploit, tax, kill, and otherwise mess us up.
Any kind of parasite is dependent upon its host, the HIV no less
than a ruling class, and therefore it is in the interest of the parasite
not to annihilate its host completely, as otherwise, the parasite too is
dead.  A balance, or stasis of some kind, must be accommodated.
The host is permitted to live only to the extent that it works to
produce a surplus for the parasite.
 
While McNeill does not prattle, as Hitler does in MEIN KAMPF,
about "sacrifice for the race", or "ruthless measures for survival," he
is at ease with that cool distance from events that permits him to
speak of "Nature" and our "species."  Susan Sontag warned against
the metaphorical treatment of disease, and that is a danger McNeill
has not resisted.  He retains a lay person's knowledge of disease
and a Chicago person's knowledge of ruling classes.  He does not,
for all the suggestion of a class analysis of plague and history, tell
us about the lost history of our own communism.  Nor does he
know about the lizard.
 
1. LIZARD TALK IN ANCIENT EGYPT
 
"AIDS!" her lips curl about the syllable.  "There is no such thing. It
is a false disease invented by the American government to take
advantage of the poor countries.  The American president hates poor
people, so now he makes up AIDS to take away the little we have."
--Prostitute in Port-au-Prince, quoted in LIFE, August 1987.
 
What about the famous plagues of ancient Egypt?  They provide an
atavistic component to the whisperings and prayers of the
bourgeoisie.  They are the "fundamentals" of the Fundamentalists.
Did not the Lord of Hosts, the wrathful Yahweh, sling down plague
and pestilence to those who got in the way of the "Chosen People"?
Listen to the voice of the chief physician of the Baptist Mission
Hospital outside of Port-au-Prince (one-third of whose beds are
unoccupied): "Fornication.  It is Sodom and Gomorrah all over
again, so what can you expect from these people?" (LIFE magazine,
August 1987).
 
In Lutheran, in Calvinist, in Vatican, in Zionist ideological practice,
these are the fool "fundamentals" dividing "darkest Africa" from the
"glory that was Greece", the slave mode of production based upon
the empire of irrigation (ancient Egypt) from the slave mode of
production based upon the democracy of the city-state (ancient
Greece), the ancient Third World from the ancient First World.
 
The plagues of the Old Testament took place in the 13th  century
B.C.E.  They are the pestilences described in the Book of Exodus.
But what is this book?  It was composed at least three hundred years
afterwards, during the reign of Solomon.  It summarizes cultic
recitation, song, and chronicle: or, the official myths of an ancient
state, and must therefore be treated accordingly.
 
Zora Neale Hurston speaks of them as pan-African stories.  The
pestilences are exercises of the magical machismo of Moses, a man
with a stick, a rod of power, a serpent god who leads slaves to
freedom.  He must fight the Egyptian oppressor and the Egyptian
gods.  The victory over Pharaoh is a victory of superior magic.
 
Moses throws down his stick, and it becomes a serpent.  He dips it
in the waters of the Nile, and the waters turn to blood.  He stretches
his staff over the streams, and frogs fall all over, even into ovens
and kneading troughs.  He strikes the dust on the ground, and
maggots spring up everywhere on man and beast.
 
Flies, hailstorms, locusts, eclipses, pestilences, boils: Moses and
his stick bring all of them, and Pharaoh's magicians are stumped at
every turn.  Thus does Yahweh defeat the frog goddess, the sun
god, and the cattle deities.
 
Such serpent-and-stick power is a living power in Haiti and in
Dahomey as Zora Neale Hurston discovered.  How did Moses, the
leader of slaves and outlaws (for these are the Egyptian meanings of
the word "Hebrew") obtain his magic?  He learned it from
Pharaoh's stable boy, Mentu.  Moses says to him, "I love you
because you know all about the beginnings of things and you tell me
about them.  You tell me such nice lizard talk."
 
But Mentu did not give his knowledge for nothing.  Moses brought
him scraps from Pharaoh's kitchens.  "Roast pork at Pharaoh's table
meant boiled hog head for the help."  With his new pupil Mentu
could say, "I am eating further back on the hog now."
 
The class relations of magic-knowledge are made clear.  It is
concocted in kitchens and stables, exchanged for a price, and only
then comes the familiar, ambiguous story of rebellion, massacre,
and new kingdom.  "'No more toting sand and mixing mortar!  No
more taking rocks and building things for Pharaoh!  No more
whipping and bloody backs!  No more slaving from can't see in the
morning to can't see at night!  Free!  Free!  So free till I'm foolish.'
They just sat with centuries in their eyes and cried."
 
Certainly, this is a version that only is possible after the liberation of
the Afro-American, the historic person who straddles Christianity,
Judaism, and Voodoo.  The reading of the Egyptian pestilences
supplied as a result of that experience is the opposite of Luther and
Calvin, the gods of capitalism, whose Gospel was really "Work or
be Hanged."
 
2. "WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY DONE IN A CORNER ..."
"ANCIENT GREECE
 
Thucydides.  Let us call him "Thuc."  He belonged to the "glory that
was Greece," and no wonder for he came from an aristocratic
family.  He was the manager of a gold mine on the frontier of the
Athenian empire.  He was a failed general and an exile of twenty
years.  We're supposed to study his book, THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR
as part of "western civilization."  OK.  Let's have a look.
 
He praised maritime imperialism.  He recounted the Athenian bid for
Mediterranean hegemony.  He lived in the transition to commodity
production, and to the money-form of human creation.  It is the
transition from piracy to commerce (smile).
 
In methodology his book is no less revolutionary, as it departs from
the magic of Moses.  It is influenced by the sophist theories of
disease propounded by Hippocrates: there is the observation of
symptoms, the chronicling of the course, the identification of the
crisis, and the analysis of causes.

The idea that Olson's idea was that you stop and breathe after each
line is a little bricky. But you can or could see the lines if you
heard him. I remember in 1963, "Maximus of Dogtown II" had not been
in print, but Olson read it in Vancouver a couple times. Dan McLeod
taped him, and then a month later sent a transcription of the tape to
Olson, and it turned out that the transcription agreed with Olson's
manuscript except for 3 times, which is pretty good for such a long
poem!

    This has happened again---what I hoped would be at least an INTERESTING
    debate (or something) about "women and tech" has just turned once again

    women in the work-force or service industry (a phenomenon often attributed
    to "women's lib") happens to occur just as technology (computers, etc)
    is accelerating---thus, there's a cause effect relation, right?
    Sure, at least Haraway doesn't argue an "essentialist feminist" position
    and in this sense may seem to open up all kinds of possibilities---
    BUT she does seem to erase class issues, issues of access, and posits
    some vague FUTOPIA that doesn't give a fuck about ecologic depletion
    and the rich getting richer---at least it seems so....chris s.

Well, if we're going to get into it, Cris S, don't be essentialist in
your reading of comments from women.  I for one have never recommended
Haraway -- you'll note the items I recommended were studies of the impact
of specific information technologies historiclly on women, and vice
versa.  For where I stand on the question of cultural critiques of the
impact of technology on society (and vice versa, again), see a review of
Mark Poster's MODE OF INFORMATION in the JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION a
couple of years ago.  And of course I should not be guilty of
over-generalizing either.  While Paul Virilio, for example, reads as
quite abstract and metaphorical, in fact his insights into the nature of
war are extremely useful in its analysis and in, again, impacts of the
development of new information technologies on the theory and practice of
war.

_scientific american_ had a recent article (june/95) entitled "from
complexity to perpelexity." it included some wide-ranging definitions of
complexity. in this century, various scientists have thought they had
found a theory that explained almost everything (but more than science
is, of course, required to realize that project)

Thanks to Herb Levy for making me think about why I loved Albert
Ayler and thought Hole was a void. Maybe it is because when I first
heard the Aylers I thought, gee, I havent heard this before and it
makes me clear away the sludge of what a lot of jazz had got into
during a long time of people trying other people's riffs. But when I
heard Hole on , I think, Saturday Night Ugh, it seemed that I was
hearing some people doing what I had heard other people doing. I
remember hearing Grandmaster Flash for the first time, and sitting up
as if I had a bullet against my eyebrow, but now I sit in a hotel
room in Helsinki and watch a Finnish rap group step up and down with
baseball hats on backward and chanted couplets and think why bother.
It seems to me that when I am turned on by something in pop music,
what I am hearing is something different from its surround but
shining with something back there in the what, tradition. That's why
I do like, say, ZZ Top.

   Thank you Sandra and Maria for your responses--Though the tone of my

   was a "mindless essentialism" going on--I too find the meandering inter-
   esting and i was trying to direct it towards such issues as "critiques
   by women of how men do science"(damon) and "the impact of specific
   information technologies historically on women" and away from the more
   depoliticized illusion of mere "writing about technology" and though
   my interests tend to be more "class" oriented (and find 'technology'
   if not a false issue at least a "vehicle" that has gotten too large
   for its tenor and thus often a huge mystifier of "social processes"
   ---which is not a critique i'd make of poetry--even if one retrospectively
   defines poets from Sir Thomas Wyatt to Emily Dickinson as "technology"
   as Fuller did), I am curious in both of your (and others') speculations
   about women and science, and what "the next phase" (if you will) would
   be, say, without the notion of CYBORG----Again, thanks. Chris

        I'd say this was extremely true that man are awarded the ability
to practice science, but women are only perceived to study the theory
enabling them to write about tech and science, but not contribute.  ( this
is a generalization)  It seems to me after talking to friends in MSC
programs that there is bias against the female ability to remain logical
at all times of the month.  Interesting theory, I'd like to see the stats
and the case study based on this observation.  I also wonder if there was
a similar study done on the male ability to retain ones senses when in
the presence of breast.

Subject:      breath rules
 
As long as it is clear that by "breath" Olson did not really mean
breathing, the inhalation and exhalation of air, there is no problem.
Some people, however, think that by breath he meant breath, and
imagine that his lines of poetry really have something to do with a
physical part of the poet. Actually his lines were a typographical
display on the page, which one is expected to "see."
 
Others are bothered by the fact that Olson simultaneously
insisted on the poem as a personal performance, and attacked the
effect of the printing press on poet, yet was much interested in
seeing his poems in print.
 
But to worry about things like this is to betray the foolish
consistency that Emerson told us is the hobgoblin of little minds,
and to ignore the "Do I contradict myself? Very well, I contradict
myself" of Whitman.
 
 Olson meant by breath the incontrovertible spirit of the poet. "But
 breath is man's special qualification as animal," he says. Even in
 praising the typewriter he saw a technical method for expressing the
 breath: "It is the advantage of the typewriter that, due to its
 rigidity and its space precisions, it can, for a poet, indicate
 exactly the breath, the pauses, the suspensions even of syllables,
 the juxtapositions even of parts of phrases, which he intends."
 Breath, like technique, is a way of asserting power:
 
        If I hammer, if I recall in, and keep calling in, the
        breath, the breathing as distinguished from the hearing, it
        is for cause, it is to insist upon the part that breath plays
        in verse which has not (due, I think, to the smothering
        power of the line by too set a concept of foot) has not been
        sufficiently observed or practiced, but which has to be if
        verse is to advance to its proper force and place in the
        day, now, and ahead. I take it that PROJECTIVE VERSE teaches,
        is, this lesson, that that verse will only do in which a poet
        manages to register both the acquisitions of his ear and the
        pressures of his breath.
 
Responses from quite a number of those who knew Olson and heard him
read make it clear that "breath" is really an inimitable transcendental
quality of the poetry and is a function of the immortal poetic soul.
 
Next question: Olson says that "breath is man's special qualification
as an animal." Did he allow women breath as well?

--not to get all pop-culture on y'all, but. . . I live next door to a
three-year old, and the other night I was baby-sitting, and he was
showing me his _Pocahontas_ (underlined as they are after the Disney
movie) figurines, and John Smith comes with a sword AND a compass;
Pocahontas is just/of course buxom, scantily clad, doe-eyed, and somehow
always=already persecuted looking. . .
There is something here--perhaps Old/New World, but male/female, too, and
worth thinking about.
I'm not going to jump on the Disney-is evil bandwagon (was driving that
particular wagon long, long ago) but there are still these mindless
misrepresentations that because they are available at any burgerstand in
the nation become fact/truth/history--accepted, and worse, acceptable.

Oh please don't start me on this one. Usually I'm a big Disney fan due
only to the skill of the animation, the stories are so-so and I've never
recovered from the butchering of the original Little MErmaid story ( it's
not supposed to have a happy ending).  But Pocanhantus wins the big loser
award.  I can see how they tired to make a fair representation, but
hollywood politics of $$$$$$ won instead.  Their big mistake was choosing
a historical figure rather than opting for pure fiction.  And come on, is
MEl GIbson really that good of a voice actor,  I thought he graduated
from the 12 step facial expression school of acting, especially after
witnessing Hamlet.
        Anyway for a better recommendation I watched "MRs. Parker and the

I think that "Happy 4th of July, everyone. . ." is a little
ambitious. For some of us it should be "Happy 1st of July." Or 14th
of July.

Hey. Linz. Read thru the file of TISH. All the way thru the 60s ther
writers in TISH went on and on about the local as the most important
fact in Vancouver writing.
Then jump ahead to my essay of a decade later, I guess, in which I
explain the difference between local (B.C. consept) and regional
(Ont. concept.)

In-Reply-To:  <B2C13A501FE@fagan.uncg.edu> from "H. T. KIRBY-SMITH" at Jul 4,
              95 02:09:02 pm
 
Where did this strange, reductionist idea that Olson equated the
length of a line with the length of a breath come from anyway? What I
read is "the HEAD, by way of the EAR, to the SYLLABLE, the HEART, by
way of the BREATH, to the LINE".
 
I don't quite understand how this gets translated into "the length of
a breath should equal the length of a line".
 
It seems to me that what's at stake here is a fundamental prosodic
principle. Do we base our verse on verse forms abstracted
from speech and regularized (historically) in print, or do we root
them in the human voice and all of its breathy irregularities in which
we can hear, as Olson would have it, the passionate speech of the
heart. To finish the quote TH Kirby-Smith starts: "But breath is man's
special qualification as animal. Sound is a dimension he has extended.
Language is one of his proudest acts. And when a poet rests in these
as they are in himself (in his physiology, if you like, but the life
in him, for all that) then he, if he chooses to speak from these
roots, works in that area where nature has given him size, projective
size."
 
What seems clear to me from this is the push in poetry to get
back to language as spoken, as voice--not as a distinguishing
identity, manifestation of self, but as root of our relation to the
world. We're in Walter Ong country here, or Stanley Cavell country
when he criticizes Derrida's graphocentrism and argues for voice as
the mark of the human and the limit of the metaphysical. Because
language is breath, ontologically speaking. Or as Chaucer has it in
Olson's favorite poem of his: "Speech is nought but ayre ybroken."
 
Also, lest we foget, "Projective Verse" is a polemical piece. It was
written in response to specific repressive, dominant practices, and
it's concerns are with creating an opening for other work to get done.
It is not prescriptive in the same way that 18th century handbooks
were. Rather, it's meant as an attack on prescription, as an opening
up. (For a very interesting discussion on the differences between the
traditional prescriptive handbooks and the proclamations and
manifestoes of modern poets after 1795, check out Donald Wesling's
*The Chances of Rhyme*.)
 
There's also, I think, a whole unopened can of worms here that has to
do with the relation of poetry to this kind of expository prose. I
just read an essay by a guy named Lawrence Rainey that attacks HD and
judges her to be a "minor" poet partially because she only wrote
poetry and never engaged in the polemical battles that so occupied
many of her male companions. As if your poetry can only be interpreted
and validated in terms of these abstract arguments, rather than the
other way around.
 
Best,
Mike

NOw, now Chris Let's not get snarky.  I don't want to shatter everyone's
image of one big happy poetic circle.  I just like it when someone as
repsectable (not sure if that really fits) as George Bowering has had the
same observations as myself.  Funny how no one attacks him isn't it?

Not only is "Projective Verse" a polemical piece; it was written in a
flash; and I remember Olson saying he was surprised at its
canonization. Worse was the dumb response of (often unsympathetic)
academics, who started talking about "Projectivist" poets, and the
"breath-line"; a highly instructive article was written a few years
ago by a U. of T. woman who showed that Williams's lines are not oral
lines but something to read AGAINST the breath, as a tight music.

WAR'S  END?
 
GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY/JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY
 
QUEENSLAND STUDIES CENTRE ANNUAL CONFERENCE   8-9 JULY
 
August 1945 marked the end of the most harrowing and transforming
collective experience in the history of modern Australia.  How much of the
'old' Australia came to an end with the cessation of hostilities, and how
much continued as before? What different meanings did the war's end have
for different groups and institutions in Australian society?
 
The Queensland Studies Centre will be holding its annual two-day
conference, in association with the History Department of James Cook
University in Townsville on 8-9 July of this year.
 
The conference will be interdisciplinary in scope,  embracing military,
social and cultural history; politics and political economy; literary and
cultural studies. Papers exploring any of the following aspects of the
topic would be welcome:
 
* literature and the arts
* education and social policy
* Aboriginal and ethnic communities
* women's history
* military and social history
* politics and industrial relations
* journalism and the media
 
Venue:  Townsville, Queensland.

SYMPOSIUM: (POST) COLONIAL FICTIONS: RE-READING ELIZA FRASER AND THE WRECK
OF THE STIRLING CASTLE.
 
University of Adelaide, 25-26 Nov., 1995.
 
Contact: Kay Schaffer, Department of Women's Studies, 08 303 5267 direct,
08 303 3345 FAX, e-mail: kschaffe@arts.adelaide.edu.au
 
Post-colonial studies within Australia have attempted to re-evaluate and
re- write colonial history to include those people either marginalised or
subjugated by the colonial process. This two day symposium will explore a
different aspect of post-colonial discourse through the exploration of one
of the best known events in Australian colonial history. In 1836 the
'Stirling Castle' was wrecked off the Queensland coast and many of the crew
together with the Captain's wife, Eliza, were marooned on Fraser Island.
Events surrounding the rescue of the castaways, in particular Mrs. Fraser,
received international media attention. In the last 160 years the story of
Eliza Fraser has become the subject of popular myth, fiction, opera, art,
film and scholarly research in the areas of cultural studies, literature,
history, anthropology, archaeology, women's studies, and the visual arts.
(Post) Colonial Fictions will examine critically the Eliza Fraser saga by
bringing together, for the first time, an interdisciplinary team of
academics, authors, artists and members of the Fraser Island community.
Discussions will include feminist analyses of the incident, textual and
iconographic representations of Aboriginal people, and Eliza Fraser as a
creative inspiration for the arts.
 
Speakers on 19th century ethnography, visual arts, and Fraser Island
history include: Ian Mc Niven, Lynette Russell, Rod McNeil, Olga Miller,
Elaine Brown; on 20th century cultural studies and Batdjala representations
include: Kay Schaffer, Sue Kossew, Jim Davidson, Jude Adams and Fiona
Foley. We are hopeful that the symposium will include an exhibition of
Fiona Foley's works and a performance by University of Adelaide
Conservatorium of Music students of the theatre opera: "Eliza Fraser Sings"
(arranged by Peter Sculthorpe/libretto by Barbara Blackman).

I am reminded of the original meaning of *inspire*--to be breathed into
by the muse. So much of Olson has to do with the visceral, and he was
let's face it a heavy breather (how could a guy as big as he not be?)
and his breaths when reading, as I recall, made the poem dramatic.
 
as for the visual: when we stop connecting poems to the flesh and blood
and breath and tempo, then maybe we're no longer talking about poems
but rather about painting-drawing-sculpture (paging Ms. Holzer) or
whatever but not poetry.

Really?  Are poems the only things that are poetry?  And is it even
possible, even given an emphasis on the visual, that poems *can* be
disconnected from flesh, blood, breath and tempo?  Or is there an
everpresent connection to these things that is merely reshaped by that
visuality?  Are painting, drawing and sculpture not connected to flesh and
blood, breath and tempo?  This paragraph makes me think of a lot of
questions (which probably should have remained unsaid).  Please elaborate, Burt.

I really dislike it when people start proselytizing on what's poetry and
what's not poetry, what's music and what's not music, what's book art and
what's not book art, etc. Can't you just say you don't like something,
without trying to cast it out of the pool? By these standards the work of
William Blake is, for the most part, not poetry at all. Do you want to cast
him out, too? Shall we begin making lists of artists whose work doesn't fit
in?

Subject:      bedside books etc
 
I've enjoyed these lists, which in many cases sent me back to my own
shelves - a process which throws up Feynmann (fine drummer, yes?),
Chatwin's Songlines and Julian of Norwich has to be worth continuing.
In my case the bedside/chairside/deskside/briefcase distinction doesn't
work, because the bedside books tend to move to the breakfast table, the
breakfast books come to work and so on - i.e. they all move. Which is
what a good book should do... Here goes:
1. Active in Airtime 4 : latest ed, of Essex University based magazine
edited by John Muckle & Ralph Hawkins.
2. Robin Blaser: The Holy Forest.
3. Ulla Dydo's Stein Reader. I needed this book years ago.
4. Ian Hamilton Finlay: Brount (Peninsula, 1995). I think this is the
only bilingual English/Dutch publication I have.
        "             : Ein Projekt fur das Bankhaus Schroder Munchmeyer
Hengst & Co (Wild Hawthorn, 1995).
5. F.C.Happold: Mysticism (this penguin anthology came off the shelf when
Julian was mentioned and I began a revisiting tour of the English Mystics).
6. Eric Mottram: Selected Poems (North & South).
        "      : Blood on the Nash Ambassador (Hutchinson).
7. Michael Palmer: At Passages (Haven't got beyond the lovely Ben Watkins
cover yet).
8. Terry Pratchett: Reaper Man (Arrgh! go back three spaces! this isn't
the kind of book serious people are supposed to like!)(But I do - apart
from anything else I like the Orang-utan Librarian, who gets paid
peanuts...).
9. Micheal Tippett: Those 20th Century Blues.
10. Gilbert White's Journals v.III, ed. Mabey, found on a remainder stall.
 
Tom Beard writes that he's moved by G.Hill, and that he hopes there's
room for that: me too: it's always room for a multiplicity of voices that
I'm interested in. But, in our over-crowded island, it's the Hill/Heaney/
Hughes/Harrison axis (more strictly, their critical supporters) which
endangers the wide view, and becomes - willingly or otherwise - a part of
the dominant culture. The other elements of poetry in the British Isles -
and there are many - often get squeezed into the margins and neglected in
one way or another. I'm sure this isn't news to anyone. G.Hill in his
early days did indeed produce some moving poetry - but he's been taken up
by the critical formalists and used as a stick with which to beat other
ways of writing. I'd like to believe he was an unwilling victim in this,
but nothing he's said or done could support such a reading.
 
I'm afraid on the whole mainstream British poetry audiences like their
poets GLUM, and the 4-H gang certainly give 'em that. Years ago I went to an
RSThomas reading where he berated his listeners solidly for fortyfive
minutes, miserable sinners, clods of earth and so on, and blow me,
everyone came out saying how wonderful it was! Against that, it's
certainly the non-dominant poetries which need the attention, the room.

--just to add to this, charles is right on the mark! what's insightful
abt his statement is the underlying apprehension of _interdisciplinarity_
in art, scholarship and reseach, the whole thing. and in the final
analysis, what charles' comment reminds me of is the crucial relation
between interdisciplinarity and the real cutting edge of art.  --and that's
a great place to be if you really want to be there

I don't think Charles A. was off base at all. In o blek 12 I used a line,
which I can't remember right now whether it was appropriated-- "What is
poetic is necessarily defined by what it is not."
 
I think the question re Olson needs to be framed in terms of --
A) did he consider his theories contingent?
& B) did he need to?
On 7/2 George Bowering cited an instance in which transcription from a
reading of an unpublished Olson poem led to surprisingly correct lineation.

Dear Rod Smith:
 
You're absolutely right. Poems can be written any way the writer wants
to write them. My point was simply that in all the discussions of
breath in Olson's work that I'm aware of (and specifically in the
essay "Projective Verse,") I can find no proposal that the
length of a line should equal the length of a breath. The discussion
of breath and its relation to the line is much more complex than that.
 
But this is not to say that you can't write poems that way if you want.
 
Best,
Mike

Damn, Mike, I cant remember the name of the woman who wrote it, but
it was really persuasive to me. It might have been a thesis at U. of
Toronto, say 7 years ago or so. She said that WCW sets up these (she
is mainly talking about the poems that look like, say, the poems in
CEP, ) poems that look as if they have regular short-line quatrains,
but read with different enjambments etc than the visual; says that
WCW was setting up the regular-looking and then forcing you to read
it differently, adding a complexity you might now expect. If I run

I have used the Hoover collection, which has a small poetics
collectiuon at the end. It is usable, and has lots of stuff from
recent folks. But it does not contain Oppenheimer, Welch and a few
others I wd hope to find.

Yeah, the late great crackpot anaimateur Fred Hill a few years ago
entered me in a poetry slam in Toronto under a silly fake name and I
read some poetry I wrote while the other contenders were reading, and
I won. I got a ridiculous but beautiful sweatshirt, and gave it to
the second-place finisher, saying that his stuff was way better. That
was a frisson of some sort.

Steve,
 
Historically speaking, I'd say that my definition of poetry stands
(not unlike in the way that my metaphor, "stands"--actually, technically
it's a catachresis in the original sense of the word--is indeed
metaphoric because it derives from the flesh and blood human who
stands; but I am wandering off . . .).  Are we perhaps needing
to make a distinction between *poetry* and *poetic*?
 
In any case, visual art (versus verbal or just plain musical "art") is
spatially oriented, whereas poetry and music are temporally oriented
(notwithstanding some mixed/blurred avant-garde art and/or performance
art), which means that experiencing one or the other will be essentially
different, I think. But okay, let's divorce verse from the bard. There
has been plenty of concrete and other kinds of poetry.  But then I
gotta compare that stuff with the thrill of hearing (better yet hearing and
seeing) Olson read, and not just cause he was star either.  And
Olson subscribed at times in writing to the belief that poetry and
the human body were connected. Didn't he?

greetings,
 
been reading Edmond Jabes' *The Book of Questions* lately, picking up
what's available in the library, as oppose to working from vol.1 thru
to vol.7
am working on a response piece to my reading and am so stuck on a
certain concept that i cant seem to place, but i think is "real". the
reading experience is like reading the commentaries (and this is
where i get confused) on the Talmud, or the Cabala. was this done by
Rabbis or family members, marginal notes they would make, questions
and such on the text they are reading. is this sort of commentary
done? and is it done stricktly by Rabbis or is a family/generational
practice? i'm certain my ideas are coming from some where, and i dont
think it was derrida's piece on jabes. i can only think about
A.M.Klein, and maybe reading related to him.
 
in any case i'm slightly stuck and looking for a gentle shove or
pull. i think there is a article in *The Sin of the Book* (Gould,
ed.) that relates to what i'm vaguely trying to pin down, but i wont
have access to that book for a few weeks, and my curiosity can't
wait.
 
in anticipation,
 
graham

I do like _The Art of Practice_ but the _o blek_ has the advantage of the
statements. & actually I'm thinking interviews cld be good. Maybe the Hoover,
o blek 12, _The Talsiman Interviews_, &/or the Berrigan interviews O Books
did. I mean it seems that they usually come in w/ enthusiasm & the trick is
not to squelch that. Berrigan is great that way, his dedication to the art, I

it's an old suggestion, but maybe teach from current little magazines
rather than anthologies?  many in AoP or oblek are pretty actively
publishing; talisman would certainly be a prime candidate fr poetry
& criticism--and you could get a dozen+ chaps (frm leave, texture,
generator, potes & poets, standing stones, &&&....).  nothing to
help enthusiasm than to have hold of something fresh & new & not-
yet-known.  plus the chance to keep a press or two in the black
(or less in the red).  PLUS, the chance to point to a coupla less-
than-perfect poems, give a flavor of what can go wrong in a poem,
as well as what's right

Burt, concerning --
"Cast Blake out?! Of what?  No, no. Please, no lists. Sorry, I just thought
that I was answering someone's query.  To hell with breathing!"
 
not to hell with it -- I like breathing, too
 
As for going to definitions of poetry, its etymology, "to stand," etc., it
seems to me that we want it both ways, want words to mean something
eternally, to contain their origins, but also to allow them to evolve, to
continue to develop and change their meanings.
 
This morning I'm not certain whether I'm more excited by Olson's human
breath, Mac Low's aleatoric generations (which may or may not involve
breathing as a compositional idea), bp Nichol's visual  compositions, or
something else. I love the quiet of Bev Dahlen's work, where one feels (in
much of A Reading, at least) one is not so much hearing speech, as
hearing/reading "thought taking shape."
 
But the idea of something being poetry because of feeling the blood move --
I don't know. Emily Dickinson said she knew something was poetry if it took
her head off. I love Dickinson & Olson, but I don't know if I want to allow
that I have to either have the blood boiling or be lobotomized before I see
something as poetry.
 
But I do like the passion with which you speak for Olson's ability to move
one who reads or hears him.

    Dear Rod--I think the suggestion that you teach your students stuff
    from contemporary magazines (suggested by who---someone from ohio?
    lbd or byrum, i forget) is good--maybe AERIEL----
    but I tend to find all anthologies pretty limiting and have taken to
    bootlegging (though that, too, involves bootlicking)--last year
    I used the sun and moon anthology--The Creeley section is eminantly
    teachable---especially the one about the tree and the one about
    the airplane (the latter can be usefully juxtaposed with the talking
    heads song "the big country")---but this time I taught an INTRODUCTION
    TO LITERATURE CLASS and wanted a better sense of new york school stuff
    than Messerli can do, but at the same time wanted older people like
    Stevens and Stein and Riding and NON-AMERICANS (oh horrors, horrors!)
    like Gig Ryan (from magazine--actually Hoover's mag.) and many Germans
    in translation....
    Of course Rod, you should teach my CUSPS poems too. chris

      "if only I weren't feeling sentimental, but how else can you get
       passionate, and I at least know that's my devoir."(74)
     So--Rod, Joe Ross's new work seems definitely more O'Hara than Ashes

Maybe she meant something as straightforward as her poems:
something is poetry when it makes you think/see/feel differently. It
suprises.
 
Must a poem surprise? And what does that have to do with "newness"? Every
breath is new, even if the air isn't fresh.

It shouldn't be too hard to find the answer to your question of whether it was
rabbis or generations of male family members --ask your resident talmudist, if
you have a judaic studies program or dept.  also, check out daniel boyarin's
work if you haven't done so already --he's a talmudic scholar and has a
post-sstructuralist, emancipatonist approach, thoug lately he's been into
lacanian psychoanalysis.  have fun w/ jabes, he's a dreamboat though i admit i
float in and out of relating to his work.  the stuff on being jewish, and on the
book, is absolutely yummy --the stuff on death...well, maybe it's too deep for
me.--md

Since we're talking Talmud, everybody should check out the recently
published Nine Talmudic Readings, by Emmanuel Levinas--I'm sure this has
everything to do with Jabes, but I haven't the slightest idea how to go
about saying just what that is.  I am, though, sure it's bigger than the
fact that Derrida writes essays on both in Wrtg and Diff.

I don't usually talk about this, but many years ago Michael Davidson and I did
underwater readings as part of a musical performance & event by Michel
Redolfi.  We performed in the swimming pool of Ginger Rogers' former bungalow
in Bird Rock (La Jolla), where Michael was then living.  There was a mask-like
device that gave us a minute -- maybe half a minute -- before it filled with
water.  Redolfi recorded it for playback within a longer underwater piece
in the olympic swimming pool at UCSD.  Michael's part was to read actual
written poetry set down with special waterproof ink, while I decided to go
with chanted translations of songs from (Seneca) Shaking the Pumpkin.  The
breathing part of it -- a constant struggle -- had nothing to do with
projective verse.  I think I ended up sounding like a beached whale, but I
actually looked pretty trim in the wet suit -- of which there are still some
photographs.
 
The naive breath notion -- of breath & line coinciding in length -- is of
course Ginsberg rather than Olson.  Allen used to be pretty boastful about
how long he could hold his breath & all of that.  (I don't mean "naive"
pejoratively, by the way -- just straightforward in the way that some of the
conversation about this has gone.  Allen is most eloquent & moving with
regard to this in the Notes for Howl.  But I don't think he ever tried it
under water.
 
All best

Loss,
 
Please list Poetry New York: A Journal of Poetry and Translation, which
comes out yearly, and which is not seeking subscriptions but encourages
people to buy it in bookstores. It is eclectic. It is archived at
SUNY Buffalo, Poets House, NYC Research Library, Brown U. and other
places. It is distributed by DeBoer. I am the Senior Editor. Tod
Thilleman is the Editor.Emmy Hunter is the Associate Editor.
We've just put the upcoming issue to bed (it will be out in late fall
at the earliest), but otherwise we welcome submissions along with
contributor's note of no more than, say, four poems and/or translations
of poems (and send in original language too if possible); but
we do NOT welcome submissions from JUne-August. Best time to send is early
spring.  I say that the magazine is eclectic but it does lean toward
the experimental (though one can find traditional verse in it too).
 
Any more questions can be directed to me at my email address or to
PNY, P.O. Box 3184, Church Street Station, NYC 10008.

Hmm...  By any chance, this piece wasn't called "til human voices reach us,
or we drown...," was it?  I  love the idea of stuff like this--a sort of
spectacular (in the SI sense?)  hyper-literalist performative action poem.
The possibilities are endless. An insomniac High-church prelate reading
Keats' Bright Star while out on a tethered space-walk: "And Watching,
with eternal lids apart,/ Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,/
The moving waters at their priestlike task...,"  George Burns (cigar
intact) lashed to the mast of a Carnival Cruise Line ship, reading
Sailing To Byzantium as it (the ship, with an Luau in full swing on the
Lido deck)  passes through the Hellespont, a Greek chorus of Arkansas
poultry processing  workers chanting Williams's Red Wheelbarrow as an endless
line of all-organic, range-fed gamehens whizz by on a conveyor belt.
 
Cut! Thats a take!  Get Bill Moyers on the phone!

Burt:
 
Sure, poetry is connected with the human body, as is dance ("poetry in
motion"), which, if I'm not mistaken, is very spatially-oriented, though it
unfolds in time as well.
 
I guess my questions weren't directed so much at the historical standing of
your definition, but at how sturdy its ontological "legs" are.  This
dichotomy between spatiality and temporality may have worked for Lessing in
1775 in the "Laocoon", but wasn't Einstein's contribution to point out that
trying to isolate space and time from each other is an illusion, however
historically stable an illusion it may be, and however different the
experience of different media with their differing locations within
spacetime?  When you say "(better yet, hearing and seeing) Olson read",
doesn't that indicate that there's something that's really important that's
visual about poetry even when it's not on the page?  To put it on the page
may be to move it closer to painting, etc., but I don't think it moves it
outside the realm of poetry, nor do I think its connection with the body
withers.  It simply takes a different approach to the body by creating a
simulacrum of a body, by embodying itself as writing, but with inspiration
still breathed into it, just like if there were a bard.
 
To belabor the point even further (sorry!)  Heidegger asserts that "all the
arts are essentially poetry" because they're all kinds of language.  Poetry
is the original art because it most "preserves the essential nature of
language."  (Origin of the Work of Art)
 
If it's just a matter of taste--concrete poetry vs. seeing and hearing a
poet speak--that's one thing, but to define "poetry" around such a choice
and, by implication, exclude concrete poetry, Apollinaire, Cummings, Blake
(as someone pointed out--Michael Broughton?), a possible ESL poetry, etc.,
etc., seems to me a bit rash.
 
If it was just an attempt to be provocative--good work!  I took the bait! :-)
 
Best to you and all,
Steve

"Must a poem surprise? And what does that have to do with "newness"? Every

A thought on poetry=ink on a page/is a drawing?: Draw in a breath."
 
A poem is a surprise, and a breath is sometimes suspended, sometimes heavy,
sometimes not taken, sometimes even visual or audible. So is ink on a page.
 
Very nice comment.

As I recall, Jim Rosenberg, whom I believe is on this list, had a show
at a gallery in SF back in the 1970s (and reasonably early in that
decade as well) which include a series of word imprinted on clear
plastic cards that were to be thrown into a swimming pool, so that
readers would swim from word to word, a poem in constant drift.
 
The same show had an "oscilloscope" (I believe that was the machine)
printout of a record of Pound reading one of his Cantos, a registration
of the voice and breath therein.
 
It was a pretty great show and has returned to my mind a thousand times
since I saw it.

Well, because of his cerebral palsey and related physical problems
(some of which were helped considerably by some surgery that he had in
his 30s), he was publishing his early books before he learned to speak.
His parents did not think that he even "had" language before he learned
to use a typewriter in his late teens.
 
The line in his work is an extraordinary physical act, given his
ability to use three fingers on one hand and a basic grasping motion
with the other. When I first read his poems on the page in the mid-60s,
I "heard" that voice too and it was not until I tried calling him on
the phone that I first realized exactly how much of a projection that
was. Eigner may in fact have been drawn to Olsonian poetics precisely
because it was there that he could in fact "speak."
 
Once his parents got to be too old to care for him and he first moved
to California, he was set up in a group home in North Berkeley where
his brother bought him a desk that had the drawers on the wrong side
(Larry can only reach to the right), so for him to reach a piece of
paper to get (with some difficulty) into the typewriter meant spinning
the wheelchair 360 degrees.
 
Those "light, airy" poems are in fact the complex choreography of one
whose total physical vocabulary is in use in the composition of the
poem.

Steve,
 
I didn't mean to be restrictive. If you like it, good. If you want to call
it art, all well and good (I guess).  But--setting Derrida's supplement aside--
I can't help going back to Ong and to the fact of time-scansion-musical
accompaniment-sceop who was historian before writing takes hold (okay,
in China this maybe doen't and didn't hold).  But regarding E's 4th
dimension and all, doesn't art create illusions?

Ed. Stmt:       Chain is a new journal that investigates language
                and its various frames. It includes poetry, prose,
                and visual work.

Issue Info:
 
Chain 1: "Special Topic: Gender and Editing" (282 p.)
107 - 14th Street / Buffalo, New York 14213
edited by Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr
appears annually
$7.95
6x9, 288 pages
issn: 1076-0520
isbn: 0-922668-12-4
publication date: October 1, 1994
 
This first issue explores its editor's apprehension about editing. It
attempts to create a dialogic space through its investigation of the
(im)possibility of an unmediated reception and the (im)possibility of
detaching a writing from its presentational/ideological form.
 
Chain 1 begins with a forum on how and why journals are created and in
what ways questions of gender have informed those decisions. As such
it investigates the implications behind making taste public and the
manner in which taste presents itself in the public sphere. This
section includes an interview between Dodie Bellamy (of Mirage) and
Andrea Juno (of Research) on Angry Women and "sex positive" editing
practices; Dubravka Djuric (of Mental Space) on editing in communist
and post- communist societies; Heather Findlay (of On Our Backs) on
collaborative editing; Susan Gevirtz (of HOW(ever)) reading editing as
medical diagnosis; Holly Laird (of Tulsa Studies in Women's Litera
ture) on the difficulties and rewards of editing feminist journals in
the academy as well as pieces from a number of small press and
feminist editors.
 
Instead of a collection that claims over and over the ability of the
editor to know and define, Chain is a journal that claims instead
"this made itself and here is what it's made of; it is just part of
what continues." In order to facilitate a journal that could make
itself, Chain used the model of the chain letter. A number of writers
from the U.S., Canada, and England were asked to send a piece of
writing to another writer. These writers responded by writing a poem
and then send ing both poems onto a third participant, and so
forth. This section includes work by Abigail Child, Gail Scott, Norma
Cole, Sianne Ngai, Kate Rushin, Fiona Templeton and others.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Chain/2: Documentary
Edited by Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr
107 - 14th St./Buffalo, NY  14213
$10 for one issue (6"x9", 250 pp.)
Make checks payable to UB Foundation.
 
The second issue of Chain questions the supposed neutrality/objectivity of
documentary forms. The concerns of this issue are: in what ways does the
topical world filter through language? how do creative forms actually capture
an event, a person, a place? The work included highlights the way we use
language/image to cut up our experiential encounters so as to (re)see them.

Subject:      Offsets to the Frame
 
The discussion of WCW's rhythm working as offsets to the frame of the graphical
line on the page interests me very much.  I've made similar observations with
respect to some of Creeley's poems.  The details can get quite lengthy, but:
I use a concept of "measure", which is not quite the same thing as the
classical concept of "foot"; many of Creeley's lines are two measures, with
the natural "grammatical framing" going from one mid-line measure boundary
to the next mid-line measure boundary.
 
I posted a quite lengthy article that deals with this and many other things
under the subject "Notes Toward a Non-linear Prosody of Space" to ht_lit some
moons back; it is available on the web at
 
http://www.well.com/user/jer/nonlin_prosody.html
 
If there is interest I can repost it here; it's about 345 lines long.

Folks--
 
I'm happy to post the "Poetics Reading List June 1995." I'm pleased that so
many people seem to think this to be a good idea. I'd like for it to be a
monthly/bimonthly feature on this list and I'm willing to do the gathering
& organization of it. All I need is your cooperation. Feel free to post
what you are currently reading or if it seems more appropriate, email me
backchannel at: kgolds@panix.com or kennyg@wfmu.org. I'll continue as long
as there is interest. I hope you won't mind if every once in a while I post
a reminder message to the group.
 
This month there seemed to be a couple of threads converging on recommended
reading. I've thrown 'em all in together as they all look like good reading
to me.
 
Peace,
Kenny G
 
P.S.--March's reading list is available through me. If you want a copy
email me or if there is enough interest, I'll re-post it.

Subject: Re: Reading lists
 
Well, I've got a few books of interest I've been looking at lately--hope
nobody minds if I chime in here...
 
 
1. Raising Holy Hell (Bruce Olds) A fictionalized life ofJohn Brown, due
out in September. Amazing book--very powerful, though it bogs down in the
last fifty or so pages, after Lee and JEB Stuart crash Brown's party at
Harpers Ferry. This is by far the best review copy to cross my desk this
year...
 
2. Manuscript Found in Saragossa (Jan Potocki) This was mentioned in
Perec's bk (A Void) & just came out in an English translation.
Hallucinatory & dense--imagine a new Decameron co-written by Goya &
Hoffman, wardrobe by Edith Head, sets by Lautremont...
 
3. Exact Change Yearbook, At Passages, From the Other Side of the Century:
all part of my vacation Michael Palmer festival. Very interesting to hear
Palmer read his new Poems. I'd not imagined his voice sounding like it
does; the surprise I felt was akin to the first time I heard Creeley or
Williams read--how hearing the poets voicing radically changes the way one
reads the written work--the way theauthors diction & intonation get somehow
ingrained in yourhead & you find yourself internalizing their vocalization.
A bit disturbing, that--almost as if the very act of listening to a
recording imposes some kind of individualized canonic reading, underming
whatever tactical method of poetic speech you've brought to the written
text...
 
4. Passing Duration, Four Lectures: I've always gotten the sensethat
Rodefer's work is somehow out there pacing the Langpo boundaries (maybe
event horizon is a better term...). Ghosts of events in those sentences,
gesturing toward some alien narrative in hopes of arriving at
atmosphere--The same thing I feel reading Coolidge sometimes. Is there
anything available since Passing Duration that I might have missed?

From: Kevin Killian <dbkk@SIRIUS.COM>
Subject: Bedside reading
 
This is Kevin Killian. I'm glad to see this feature return, as I too read
Vanity Fair regularly tho' the book list is not my favorite. The true crime
articles are.
 
Here is what I've just picked up from around my bed:
 
"Vel" by Peter Inman-fantastic. Four stars to you, P. Inman. We printed one
of these poems in"Mirage #4/Period[ical]" but now I see, it was not the
best one after all, there are many, many just as good or better!
 
"Castle King Four," by Jim Reagan, who sent me this book, haven't read it
yet, don't know why he sent it. He said it was a peace offering. I don't
know who he is! Seems to be a novel that pits Nazis against the OSS.
 
"Sliver," by Ira Levin. I read it about every six months. Dodie wrote a
paper about it once, for Todd Baron and Carolyn Kemp's zine "REMAP," on
"narration." "A zillion times better than the movie," she says. When is the
Ira Levin Conference happening?
 
Claude Royet-Journoud, "A Descriptive Method," tr. Keith Waldrop-it's
small, I should have finished this last week. Didn't. Just found it.
 
"Berlin Diptychon" by John Yau & Bill Barrette. I'm copying one of the
poems here, "The Night Beast is Best," for my new poem, which will have a
better title. This book is very luxe, glossy, heavy ink smell, has Berlin
written all over me.
 
"Tender Agencies," by Dennis Denisoff. Why this book isn't a best seller
I'll never know. Dennis D. is so smart & so accessible. He is a former
member of the Kootenay School and from what I understand will be working at
Princeton this fall. Yay Dennis.
 
"Abusing the Telephone," by Dennis Barone. We had Dennis B. read at Small
Press Traffic where he read some of this. We were screaming, kind of. I
mean it was sedate in a way. This is a very fiction collective kind of
book, tho published by Drogue. Dennis, any one of these tales could have
been a novel, I say, expand, don't contract, be expansive like Whitman.
 
2 new books by Alice Notley. Haven't opened it yet.
 
Thom Gunn, "The Man with Night Sweats." Thom Gunn is a local hero & a swell
guy. This book is his best one yet.
 
"Arshile #4" ed. Mark Salerno. Arshile #4 features an interview with
Gilbert Sorrentino. I always wondered why I had never met GS since he works
at Stanford and I'm in San Francisco. Now I find that "the Bay Area is so
utterly antithetical to me that I find myself, at all times, struggling
against its cuteness, its apathy, its general air of paralysis, its
relentless small-townishness, so that it's hard to imagine being 'mellowed
out' in the throes of battle. I don't quite know what it is about the
place, but the entire Bay Area, with the source of infection being, of
course, that citadel of provincialism, San Francisco, has the air of an
amateur stage production set in sinister natural surroundings." What a
jerk. How about that "source of infection" metaphor Mr. Sorrentino? Are we
afraid of the AIDS virus at Stanford University? Anyhow Arshile #4 has this
wonderful piece in it by Yoko Ono and as usual a marvelous cover, this time
by Jasper Johns.
 
Bruce Andrews, "Ex Why Zee," collected, I don't know, work for the
"theater"? Black and white drawing on the front, "pathetic masculinity" as
the art forum says. "Abject art" my favorite. All these little men running
around doing disgusting things, . . . four stars for the cover alone,
belongs in the Whitney.
 
"Apex of the M" #3. Read it from cover to cover searching for the
explanation from the editors, why on earth they went ahead last time and
printed that work by King Homophobe Ed Dorn! No explanation, still. One
editor told me that if they explained every editorial policy they made it
would be too long a magazine. Fine. Just wanted to put in my 2 cents on
this subject. Again.
 
"Everything as Expected," by James Herndon. This book, from the 70's, is
the essential insider's guide to the collaboration between Jack Spicer &
Fran Herndon. Color plates. Seven of these collages were shown at recent
Blaser conference. Five stars.
 
"Tony & Susan," by Austin Wright. I think I got this mixed up with "Austin
and Mabel" but instead of being about the relatives of Emily Dickinson it
is some kind of literary horror novel. Check it out. I'm up to Chapter
Five.
 
"Esther: Her Murder Haunts a Small Town in Oklahoma." True crime book.
Esther is a schoolteacher, in her seventies I think, I think she was
murdered in her sleep by some former students, but she's just gone to bed
just now at the place I've put it down.
 
"Written in Blood," by Caroline Graham. She is my new favorite detective
writer. Okay, so the ends of her books are always stupid.
 
"Empire of Words: the Reign of the OED," by John Willensky. This guy
teaches at UBC and this book studies the use of citation in the different
editions of the OED to come to some conclusions about cultural studies.
Work it, girl.
 
Finally I've come to the floor. Okay and one last book I've just finished
from the library, "The Juror," by George Dawes Green. had to get this one
since it's the basis of the upcoming Demi Moore picture. The back jacket
says that Dawes Green is a poet and the author of "the acclaimed novel "The
Caveman's Valentine" and he looks about 12. Excellent! George Dawes Green
are you on this poetics list? Come on down!

I love these lists also. Although Kevin's has made mine feel inadequate. My
excuse is moving. I've been trying to refile but I've also pulled out all
these old books that I found while trying to alphabetize:
 
Mary Butts Imaginary Letters; Crystal Cabinet; Traverner Novels; (by the
way, any Butts fans out there, would love some info back channel about any
good criticism, I haven't found much at all good or bad, and info about the
Crowley-Butts connection and her opium addiction (?).
 
Don DeLillo, Libra
 
Keri Hulme, Bone People (which has been abandoned as unreadable)
 
Ben Friedlander (there is an image of a knot for the title) (this is
available from Meow Press); recommended
 
Rachel Tzvia Back, Litany (also Meow Press and recommended)
 
Prosodia / 5 (nice mix of writers, mainly west coast; put out by the
students of the New College of California Poetics Prog)
 
Bloo (good pieces by Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian and Pat Reed)
 
Lesli Scalapino, Defoe (I love this book and have become obsessed with it
in the same way that I became obsessed with Fanny Howe's Saving History
last year)
 
a large stack of fashion magazines where I have actually been spending most
of my reading time
 
I would like it if people on this list would just post a brief message
about something good they have read whenever they read it and how to get
it. I mean both stuff that is available at any Barnes and Noble and stuff
that comes in the mailbox. In more cases than not that usually motivates me
to obtain said item and in more cases than not I am glad that I did.

Hi all--here's what's threatening to fall on me and crush me in my sleep:
 
_How Things Work: Science For Young Americans_, a 1941 textbook with some
truly freaky illustrations.
 
_Earth and Sky Every Child Should Know_, similar, except w/a 1910 copyright.
 
Mark Twain, _The Innocents Abroad_.
 
Thich Nhat Hahn, _The Blooming of a Lotus_, a wonderful book of simple
meditations.
 
Levi-Strauss, _The Savage Mind_. Learned a new word ("moiety") from this
one. Means "half." Not a hapax--he uses it twice.
 
A stack of submissions to Antenym, the magazine I edit (#7 due out in
August, featuring [at least] George Albon, John Olson, Colleen Lookingbill,
Darlene Tate, J.R. Willems, John Taggart, Charles Borkhuis, Michael
Basinski, Brian Boury, Andrew Joron, Michael Price, Kristin Burkart, Sheila
E. Murphy, Carol Ciavonne, Larry Eigner, Mike Kettner, I.E. Skin, Jean Day,
and Bob Heman). Now if I can only figure out in what order to present them!
 
 
_Six By Seuss_. Of course.
 
And soon--
Buckminster Fuller, _I Seem To Be A Verb_. Soon as I can get my hands on a copy.

Okay--I'll chime in---
I'm reading these unpublished manuscripts---
I am extremely knocked out by Ben Friedlander's reading of Frank O'Hara AND
YOU BIG NAME PUBLISHERS OUT THERE ARE FOOLS NOT TO JUMP ON IT WHILE YOU
CAN----
This is the kind of "literary criticism" one does not see often-- Then I'm
reading THE FATE OF THE SELF (By Corngold--first time in paperback of a
1985 book---I'm reading this for possible "academic use" so i'm reluctant
to mention it here, as is my reading in Shakespeare criticism--Susan
Snyder, H.T. McCrary, etc. etc--- ) Also got the EXACT CHANGE BOOK---The
Stein piece (and Spahr's intro.) is great. Peter Gizzi's new manuscript has
a great poem to Mark McMorris in it...and I got the new Garret lansing
HEAVENLY TREE book...
I'm sure I'm leaving things out...I read "Marriage" by Marianne Moore the
other day---I often spend a whole night on one page! I read O'Hara's "To An
Actor Who Died" because it's original title was "To Laura Riding" and
"everybody" is telling me I should read Agamban very soon---
It would be interesting if we could talk more about why we're reading (or
what is happening why reading) than merely about WHAT--but perhaps that is
not a function of the list....chris

I "forget to mention" (or "censored") that I'm also reading a lot of
student papers in this summer class i'm teaching. A "reading literature"
course that is weighted towards poetry and the reading of "non-poetic"
texts "poetically"--I organized the course loosely around the theme of
"NOTHING" and have not used official anthologies so i could include Stevens
("Adagia"), Mayer (Sonnets and "the obfuscated poem") O'Hara, Cage, Stein,
Riding, Kafka, Beckett, Ellison, Baraka, Ferlinghetti, Dickinson,
Shakespeare, Dudley Randall, Blake in one class (also Brecht and
Rilke)---I've selfishly swept up my students in my summer reading--but I
"commit" to the list and so it's no more "free" in a way than had i gone
with a "conventional" commercial anthology---thank "god" for copy shops
that 'pirate" things--- Chris S.

Digest - 25 Jun 1995 to 26 Jun 1995
 
I, too, really like the "bedside reading" feature of the list. Here are
some that are, actually, closer to the couch:
 
1) VOLCANO, by Garrett Hongo, in which he recounts his search for the Big
Island childhood he never had. An honest attempt, woefully written (he puts
Keats and Shelley in a cuisinart and pours the remains over fields of
lava).
 
2) THE WINGED SEED, Li-Young Lee. A memoir/prose poem about growing up in
Indonesia and rural Pennsylvania, as the son of a Chinese fundamentalist
Christian father. Interesting experiment, which most often works, except
when he addresses his beloved.
 
3) TURNING JAPANESE, David Mura. Yes, there's a theme here. Memoir of an
Asian-American poet from Minnesota who lived for a year in Japan;
interesting "identity" study. I like his prose better than his poetry,
which sounds more like, well, prose.
 
4) DICTEE, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. Memoir in experimental pieces, which I
haven't yet finished. But there's a strong article on her by Shelley Wong
in _Feminist Measures_, edited by Lynn Keller and Cristane Miller
(Michigan)--good on the "problem" with Asian-American experimental writing
and identity politics.
 
5) Lots and lots of Gertrude Stein.
 
6) XENIA, by Arkadii Dragomoschenko. Wonderful meditative passages.
 
7) CANNIBAL, by Terese Svoboda. OK, so she's a friend of mine. I heard her
read sections of this book about her travels in the Sudan at our new Barnes
and Noble; they put her in the cookbook section.
 
8) Poems by Sudesh Mishra, a poet from Fiji who lives in Australia. Rather
Walcottesque in its metaphorical density; his claim is, however, that this
work IS experimental in his context.
 
I also confess to an over-fondness toward Nirvana's Unplugged cd, though
I'm perhaps too late for the rock lyric discussion of a while back. Great
rendering of a Leadbelly song.

Subject: Doom Patrols (Reading list)
 
As long as I'm giving out URLs, one of my summer reading books is not yet
in print and only available on-line, Steve Shaviro's "Doom Patrols." It can
be found at <http://dhalgren.english.washington.edu/~steve/doom.html>.
 
 
Based on the chapters I've read so far, I highly recommend it to anyone on
poetics list.
 
It's not, and not about, poetry, but it's the first prose book I've read in
a while that's given me the same buzz as the all-over, personal inner-mind
sprawl of many recent longpoems.
 
"Doom Patrols" is an autobiographical work of literary theory; a rich blend
of gender theory, electronic culture, comic books & films, true
confessions, (very) revisionist post-structuralist thought, rock & roll,
self-exposition, new (&old) abjectionists) and more. Chapter titles
include: David Cronenberg, Kathy Acker, Dean Martin, Daniel Paul Schreber,
Walt Disney, Cindy Sherman, et al.

_the presocratics_, by philip wheelwright. a general text chosen fr its
contextualizing approach. interested in pursuing pythagoreanism and cont.
art. might have some value
 
_on christian doctrine_, st. augustine
 
-revelations of divine love_, julian of norwich
 
-the temple-, george herbert: interesting -- i found a copy of _the temple_
in the UBC bkstore a few days before the blaser conference. colin browne
presented a paper on herbert there which was incredible! timing is
everything
 
everything and anything by bpNichol. re reading bk 1 for the 3rd or 4th
time. the first few pages always astound me! everything he does in the
other bks is set down there: "premonition of a future time or line we will
be writing" ... "a future music moves now to be written" ...
 
_the surrealist parade_, by wayne andrews (i'm certain he's the author:
just picked it up at a used bkstore. it looks like it's written part
documentary/part journal, which is why i bought it. it also contains some
hugo ball quotes which i've never come across previously

You might for argument's sake teach some letterpress books from Toothpaste

_The Ern Malley Affair_ by Michael Heyward, Faber & Faber, (London, Boston)
284 pp., $12.95 US, $19.99 Canada
 
in paper and available through Barnes & Noble (they have several copies at
the Astor Place branch,) is notable for the clarity with which it deals
with the complexities of taste, literary identity, and experimental
writing. The book seems (from here) a subtle treatment of the literary
scene in Australia in the 40s, particularly of the self-regard of Max
Harris and the stance of his magazine, _Angry Penguins_, that so irritated
James McAuley and Harold Stewart, two poets in an OSS-sounding organization
called the Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs, that they
manufactured, with the aid of a collected Shakespeare, the Concise Oxford
Dictionary, a Dictionary of Quotations, and a US Army report on mosquito
control, Ern Malley and his poems. In an afternoon. Ahem. Anti-hegemony and
Edgar Allen (sic!) Poe take note:
 
Malley was born in an idle moment that afternoon in the spring of 1943.
After lunch McAuley and Stewart had the place to them- selves: there were
no urgent telegrams to deal with, no research jobs to finish on the double.
Here was their chance to do something they'd fantasized about, take _Angry
Penguins_ down a peg or two. Another issue was just out--they thought it
reached new heights of pretension. They set to work improvising Ern Malley,
their Primitive Penguin, writing his poems out on an army- issue, ruled
quarto pad, tearing each page off as they filled it.
 
Heyward is not _totally_ convinced of the merit of the poems, which are
collected in the book (as are Malley's Ernst-ish collages), but he does
cite defenders of the work including Judith Wright, John Tranter, John
Ashbery and Kenneth Koch. Some effects of the hoax were: to unbalance the
equation of value between a work of poetry and the name on it; to suggest,
very early on, the possibility that work generated by chance and mischief
(and with deliberate disregard for taste) can be taken for beautiful and
meaningful; and to turn public attention to poetry (albeit disastrously).

Hello poetics,
Suppose it may have been noted, but Joe Ross has poems in _Avec_ &
_Impercipient_ from something called "The Fuzzy Logic Series"-- he's
referred to them as "Ashberyan" and they do seem so. Particularly compared
to other of his work.
Re my own bed:
I'm taken at the moment by _Touch Monkeys: Nonsense Strategies for Reading
Twentieth-Century Poetry_ by Marnie Parsons. U.Toronto Press overpriced
hardcover. Interesting reading of Stein/Zukofsky/Language through Lewis
Carroll, Edward Lear, etc. using Kristeva to very good end. Though she gets
Cage wrong I think. But I would.
Also the new Hobsbawm _Age of Extremes_ very excellent.
Really wanted to like Deirdre Bair's _Anais Nin_ --more interested in Bair
than Nin, i.e. why did she choose to write about her following Beckett &
Beauvoir-- but it's fallen to the wayside.
Also I have many copies of _Aerial 8: Barrett Watten_ beside my bed which I
certainly recommend. $12.95 to Aerial/Edge, POBox 25642, WDC 20007. I'll be
posting soon a longer description of that as well as backlist info.
Lightning w/ logic: dogs bark at strangers. Not enough & too much? or Maybe
you had too much too fast. Can the Fuzzy be more than metaphorical? as
Chaos Theory was a hot metaphor in the arts a few years ago. Not to dismiss
description but I want to see it happen. I mean, The sun _is_ one foot
wide. How?

1) Richard Shusterman, _Pragmatist Aesthetics_, Blackwell 1992. Chap. 2
gives a concise history of the study of aesthetics that might be relevant
to those involved with the thread on art & aesthetics a while back.
 
2) Hilary Putnam, _Realism with a Human Face_. Pragmatism in a
non-Rortian/poststructuralist key.
 
3) Theodor Adorno, _Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic_, trans. &
intro. by Robert Hullot-Kenter. Hullot-Kenter read a mind-blowing paper at
BlaserFest '95 on the link between ethics & aesthetics. In view of the
dominance of the market in shaping aethetic values and reception and the
cancellation of the possibility of meaningful ethical reflection by
pervasive multinational corporate capitalism, he asked, what's the point of
beating this non-issue to death? Touche'.
 
4) Rod Smith's _The Boy_ & Jeff Derkson's _Dwell_ (poems).
 
5) Aerial 8 (fantastic issue) and Raddle Moon 13, special section on
"Woman/Writing/Theory." And just in: Situation 9 (thanks Mark!).
 
6) Edgar O'Hara, _Cedazo Tan Chucaro_. Anyone else interested in this
dynamite Peruvian poet?
 
7) Leslie Anne Boldt-Irons, _On Bataille: Critical Essays._
 
8) Don Byrd, _The Poetics of the Common Knowledge_. Indispensable wisdom.
 
9) Paul Fry, _A Defense of Poetry_. Possibly dispensable wisdom.
 
10) Robert Musil's _The Man without Qualities_. Where has this guy been all

11) _The Guitar Handbook_. Oh, and if Hank Lazar can mention Coltrane as

I enthusiastically recommend for a solid intro. Walter Ong's book Orality
and Literacy (re. alphabet as tech, etc.). I guess the alphabet is
inevitably to be seen as a technology since it comes with writing. You
might want to look at Hand's End by David Rothenberg who builds on
Heidegger; R argues that language is a technology (I'm only half convinced
and doubt I'll go the other half but who knows?).
 
Also I recommend Evelyn Fox Keller's books especially the earlier stuff
though the later is more elaborated but more hastily written and thus for
me not as satisfying a read. Also Marion Namenwirth's stuff. Both address
women and science / women and technology mostly having to do with the way
the cultures of science and tech work and showing how scientific knowledge
is "skewed" by male perceptions. Very interesting and at times even
exciting stuff.

Somebody mentioned Avital Ronnell and I think Stein was also cited.
 
I would add Donna Haraway's _Simians, Cyborgs and Women_ (her "Manifesto
for Cyborgs," included here, was first published in Socialist Review).
Still the best single source on "pomo" topics there is.
 
Anything by Sandra Harding on feminism & science would also be of value,
tho she is, by nature, a more "normative" academic author. Meaghan Morris
(sp?) has done work on malls that would be good to juxtapose with
Baudelaire & w/ Benjamin on Baudelaire. (and, generally, I don't agree that
people have gone beyond Benjamin in writing on technology, with the
possible exception of Haraway. Benjamin's work has brought forth an
enormous amount of deritive drivel, attempts at a politicized MacLuhanism.
But it's precisely how he is NOT a MacLuhan that is of interest.
 
I'd add Kathy Acker and several poets whose work shows up in discussion on
this list.

I've enjoyed these lists, which in many cases sent me back to my own
shelves - a process which throws up Feynmann (fine drummer, yes?),
Chatwin's Songlines and Julian of Norwich has to be worth continuing. In my
case the bedside/chairside/deskside/briefcase distinction doesn't work,
because the bedside books tend to move to the breakfast table, the
breakfast books come to work and so on - i.e. they all move. Which is what
a good book should do... Here goes: 1. Active in Airtime 4 : latest ed, of
Essex University based magazine edited by John Muckle & Ralph Hawkins.
2. Robin Blaser: The Holy Forest.
3. Ulla Dydo's Stein Reader. I needed this book years ago. 4. Ian Hamilton

English/Dutch publication I have.

Burt:
 
Sure, the music is poetry is an absolutely crucial part of it.  All I'm
trying to get at is that the visual aspect of it is crucial *too*.  What
about the role drama played in Greek poetry and in the poetry of the man
we've come to call "The" Bard?  Certainly there's a massive visual emphasis
present as well.  And even before writing, what do we know about the role of
gesture in language (essence or history?)  Seems to me neither Ong nor
Derrida (at least in _Orality and Literacy_ and _On Grammatology_) deal with
the gestural component of language, and the role of the body and the eye in
that, and I think it might add an interesting dimension to this debate.
Anyone have any insights into this?
 
Sure, art creates illusion, language creates illusion, reality creates
illusion too.  But that's not all any of these things create, and I hope
it's not the intention of art, language or reality to leave us stranded in
illusion (what a bummer that would be!)

Steve Carll,
 
Yes! Gesture!
This has actually been the term I've been using to describe to myself recent
writings of my own. It's about duration & is a quality much Zen poetry has.
So, maybe, _through_ duration the graphic aspect is more, I almost want to
say "powerfully" or "perfectly" inscribed-- but no, it's that the illusion
(concrete &/or abstract) is more particularly revealed. The speed of it fuks
up the artifice, not to remove it, but revel/reveal it as/at-- well it's
actually making "the world" or the room or _something_. The mistake of any
writing is the given & the procedure. The mistake is doing it, not the before
or after. In recent work I think Grenier's box & Scalapino generally are
operating in this area. Sometimes Howe perhaps, but in another sense, it
seems more 'polished' yet it keeps that, to refer to another conversation,
ability to take yr top off. & Ron S. (if you're out there, what's the role of
revision in N/O? or the alphabet generally-- do you not do it?) & Carla H, &
M. Neilson, you can talk abt a lot of work usefully with these terms I think,
but there's danger of stretching the term too far. Raworth! Gesture that just
keeps going. Makes it live. God I hardly ever use exclamation marks. I'm
gonna go have a beer.

Interesting. Somewhere Creeley admits that when he started reading
WCW he tried to read it with a pause after every line, and that was
the way he, Creeley, was writing; he found out that it doesnt work

Nice post from Silliman re Larry Eigner. The wonderful nouny-ness of
Larry's Mass. poetry was also part;y aided by virtue of the fact that
he had a towerish room with windows on all sides, so he could look at
Swampscott he could not walk thru. Get it all by eye. There was an
old story that when Olson was taken up the road to see Eigner, he
could not handle Larry's condition and appearance. Gad, what a
comparison he must have felt. Eigner's poetry, so many years of it,
needs some critical work, doesnt it? Where are the young ones with
energy?

_Force_was composed almost entirely via revision. Most of the rest of
the Alphabet uses it very sparingly (most finished manuscripts are
99.99 percent unrevised, but it seldom ever gets quite all the way to
100 percent--I find spelling errors or realize an inversion that would
do wonderful things to the prosody or discover I've forgotten a word).
As I recall, O had a little revision in it, but N almost none
whatsoever, given its methodology that anything went.

I'd like to ask some questions.
 
1. Is there a distinct difference, according to any criterion at
all, between free verse and formal verse, or is there a spectrum
ranging from most formal to most free?
 
2. Are there different distinguishable kinds of free verse?
 
3. Is free verse more visual than formal verse--does it have more
spatiality, either in the imagination or on the page or both?
 
4.  Does anyone talk about "cadence" any more?
 
5. Can there be a free-verse "foot" ?
 
I am not sure whether asking these questions is more like throwing

I will find out.

even chance activities do not escape the Rules governing the

spaces)  and    also     the "scene"  of writing for the writer is
another hidden determinant
 
(there was more, but there's something missing from the scribbled
entry and the above is a gist)
in a back-channel re-exercises or experiments  for writers
to Charles Bernstein some
moons ago I suggested that
 
the rules governing cut-up and chance procedures with appropriated
texts were applicable ONLY to the texts in hand and were not
generalizable to all and any occasions (certainly my experience
with that), so that "exercises and experiments"  or "rehearsals" as they

in practice "performances"       the categories merge
 
are Chopin Studies "exercises"?   or J.S.Bach Inventions or B Bartok

To the question:
 
 Does anyone talk about "cadence" any more?
 
I'd say yes in the realm of open mike readings the rising of voice and
meter is essential in claiming the ear of your audience.  It is more
difficult to achieve on the page, but thrilling when heard by the author
in a live reading.  Personally I use cadence often when doing a reading;
I find using a breathless voice that allows the words to tumble out of my
mouth and land in a hurried jumble builds anticipation and appreciation for
the softer slow phonetic sounds that I like to end with, however the
trick is to still be understood and interpreted by the audience.  This
takes great skill that I haven;t quite mastered.
        Verse form doesn't matter so much as cadence is purely a live
thing. How to read a poem is purely subjective in my mind.  After hearing
tapes of Tennyson read it has greatly affected the way I read him now.

Regarding Lindz's belief that "Verse form doesn't matter so much as cadence
is purely a live thing. How to read a poem is purely subjective in my
mind."
 
The live utterance can certainly put its stamp on cadence, but the language
used has something to do with it as well. I know that in years when I was
teaching, reading Emily Dickinson aloud was useful, but it was meant to
bring the written magic out, not to inject something that wasn't really
there at all in the writing. So, no, cadence is not "purely a live thing."
Reading a poem is also not purely subjective, although it may be subjective
within limits established by the language of the poem.
 
As to your description, Lindz, of your own readings, are you talking about
a voicing of the words entirely disassociated from the writing, or are the
"words that tumble out of [the] mouth and land in a hurried jumble" and the
"softer slower phonetic sounds" represented in the language as written. If
not, I don't see why they can't be. The language is capable of
accomplishing such acts, written or voiced. Hearing it is something else,
and we're (the big WE of culture) not teaching that very well, I don't
think.
 
It would be useful to know, from those of you who teach poetry, what
percentage of time you take in your classes to read poems aloud, and to
have students read poems aloud. Sounds terribly simple, but I always found
it to be perhaps the most useful thing to do, at any level in the
educational experience.

re Charles Alexander's post.  I've only "taught poetry" a couple of
times, but agree that reading aloud is rather important.  Otherwise I
would be puzzled how to begin, when the poem says something, but not
very much, and too little when compared with someone actually doing
a performance of it (reciting/reading). Hearing Robert Creeley
sounding entirely like Robert Creeley, reading William Carlos Williams
a couple of weeks back gave me a lot of what I took to be the
pleasure of Williams poem. It was nice to hear Creeley enjoy it, and
that enjoyment was what got me going: (to hell with the old
subjective/objective talk). I guess an accomplished practitioner of
poetry can hear someone else's poem move off the page and into the
air, as they'd like their own to do.
   Anything else interesting  is the talk generated
by the reading and hearing it.  I can't believe in an interpretative
attempt on painting/sculpture etc that doesn't stem from a
performance of "looking", or music crit that has not been listening.
The effort, and it is a big effort of attention, is one of the
important things that makes any art-writing live.
   So if, as Charles says, this is not much done (hard to believe
people on this list don't do it!), something could be wrong with
teaching somewhere.  [Sure it's a hobby-horse and I've said this
before in similar circumstances, for which I don't apologise.]

Sure, there can be a free verse foot. In fact there cannot not be. A
foot is any principal stress with any number (say from 0 to 4) of
secondary etc stresses. Or in quantity the equivalent. Just walk
while you're reading the poem. It wasnt called an "elbow."

Subject:      LitNet Call-In Day Defending NEA
 
Dear Friends:
 
I am writing to all of you who helped with *Freely Espousing* in the first
months of 1995 with some information that I hope you will consider acting
on.
 
LitNet, the advocacy organization that has been struggling these past
months (and years) to preserve federal arts funding for the writing
community, has announced a Congressional call-in day on Tuesday, 11 July.
The goal of the action is to ensure that a Senate reauthorization bill
(S.856), scheduled for mark-up in the Committee on Labor & Human Relations
sometime this week, not be crippled by amendments that would adversely
affect literature.
 
Although the bill is not ideal, its current form does allow for individual
writers and literary publishers and organizations to apply for federal
grants; budgetary reductions are set at 2% per year over five years.  (As
most of you know,this is a much less draconian vision of the NEA's future
than the one recently articulated in the House.)
 
LitNet recommends the following specific messages:
 
1) If you live in Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio,
Tennessee or Vermont, consider using the following argument:
 
        I am a resident of your state and a member of the Literary Network.
I'm
calling to ask you to support a reauthorization bill for the National
Endowment for the Arts that does *not* increase the amount of money already
allocated to the state arts agencies.  Literature is a uniquely national
art form--sending more money to the states would effectively eliminate the
NEA literature program.  Also, please support federal funding for direct
grants to individual writers and grants that require small arts
organizations (such as non-profit publishers and literary centers) to raise
only 1:1 matching funds.  Thank you for your time and attention.
 
2)  If you live in New Mexico or Oregon:
 
        I am a resident of your state and a member of the Literary Network.
I'm calling to ask you to support as large an appropriation as possible
for the National Endowment for the Arts in FY96.  Also, please support an
appropriations bill that *does not* increase allocations to the state arts
agencies and that *does* continue to fund fellowships for individual
writers and grants to small arts organizations such as non-profit
publishers and literary centers.  Thank you for your time and attention.
 
3)  If you live in Washington, Senator Gorton is a member of both
committees.  Please tell him you wish to leave two messages and then tell
him (1) and (2) above.
 
If you can't call on Tuesday, call on Monday or Wednesday.  If you have
friends living in any of the mentioned states, please take five minutes and
contact them about this very important effort.
 
Finally, Anne Burt can only hone LitNet's efficacy if she knows what people
out there are doing:  call her at 1-212-741-9110 and let her know what
action you have taken, or fax her at 1-212-741-9112.

I could not imagine teaching a poetry course without reading the
poems aloud (as well as using tapes etc, such as the CD-ROM of
"Poetry in Motion"), but more important, reading the poems aloud. It
would be like teaching an art course without looking at any paintings
etc.

        Ron Silliman:
 
        Olson was actually a heavy reviser, though to be sure there are
passages in which he seems to be saying "first thought, best thought."
 
        I did a lot of work in the Archive at Connecticut when it was
still very primitively cataloged, and I would find a manuscript of this or
that poem, and I point it out to George Butterick who would say, "Oh, yes,
there are alot of those."
 
        Olson would completely re-copy or "re-vision" poems-- often
changing only  a few words or line breaks, etc.
 
        Later he did not so much revise as throw away. Poems begin on
whatever piece of paper at hand and frequently end with increasingly
illegible scribbles. It appears that the more or less completed poems
(always a question, of course, what is complete?) did get written
straight through, but sometimes after several stabs.
 
        You could say that he didn't revise much, but he wrote many poems
that were very similar to one another.

Charles wrote:
 
As to your description, Lindz, of your own readings, are you talking about
a voicing of the words entirely disassociated from the writing, or are the
"words that tumble out of [the] mouth and land in a hurried jumble" and the
"softer slower phonetic sounds" represented in the language as written. If
not, I don't see why they can't be. The language is capable of
accomplishing such acts, written or voiced. Hearing it is something else,
and we're (the big WE of culture) not teaching that very well, I don't
think.
 
 
I agree that the initial play is in the writing of the poem, but a certain
life comes from the skill of the reader.  It's partciallly the personal
aspect that is added, the intimacy of the poet reading.  But I often think
I'd like to hire and direct an actor to read my poems, because I can't
always present them in the exact way I see them in my head or on the page.
I also found when friends share poems and read each other's works aloud
two very different products emerge.
         In live reading I have two goals. First,I like to make poetry less
a part of myself and more of a moment, a dramatic experience rather than a
revelations of myself.  I think the page is something we can hide behind
as writers.  Symbols on a page conveying images of thoughts and moments
that have already past.  Live readings alter this perception as they
audience thinks they are witnessing the exposure of the poet.  Which isn't
necessarily true, but an excellent form of manipulation by the poet.
        Second, how to read a poem must be taught, and among my non-post
secondary educated friends written works do not reach them.  Yet bring
them to a live experience and they are transformed.  I try to include them
in my writing.  I take the skills I have learned in my education and apply
them in a form that they will understand and enjoy.  Poems were never read
aloud in my experience until I took a 3rd year English course that
surveyed 20th century lit.  My prof did an amazing reading of Plath's
"Daddy", now that is cadence in action.  Most of my profs were too shy to
read aloud to the class.

Now this gives me a jolt!  I had no recollection of *water* being involved in
that piece, but now that Ron mentions it I do have a vague glimmer of a
proposal involving water.  Was it in a text on the wall at that show?  Was it
just something we talked about?  I'm not sure, but I don't remember ever
actually executing a piece in water.  Now days, of course, what would be fun
is holography:  project the words into the whole space.  (The person who has
done the most work with words and holography to my knowledge is Eduardo Kac.)
 
The show Ron is talking about (how nice to have it remembered!) was called
Temporary Poetry 10/73.  I do still have some documentation of it, and one of
these days I'm going to get a scanner and put some of that stuff up on my
web.  (Right now all I have there is a brief paragraph describing it.)
 
I did one other installation, at the Kitchen in NY in May of 75.

It was, as I recall, the series of cards on the floor, a word per card.
 
There's this overpriced "poetry magnet" game, little words on
magnetized squares for play on the refrigerator or wherever, these
days, and it was modeled after that.
 
(Actually, that game has never much appealed to me, but I have thought
of using computer programs to pull out characteristic vocabularies and
do Stein, Kerouac, Hemingway, Faulkner, etc. versions of that.)
 
Just saw the big Cage show here in Philadelphia yesterday. Very much in
that same spirit. There's a "program your own score" computer game in
it, move the mouse and click to get different effects and one of my
three year olds, Jesse, did such for about 10 minutes with a half dozen
adults all wearing headphones nodding appreciatively.

Compound Eye, edited by poet Ange Mlinko (see a poem of hers in the

With Lawrence's *novels*, however, there was much revision.  Three
complete versions of *Lady Chatterley's Lover*.  It would be interesting
to hear some talk about revision and spontenaeity as generically
differentiated values.
 
With regard to Ashbery, this is from the Appendix to John Shoptaw's pretty
interesting new book, *On the Outside Looking Out*:
 
"Soon after finishing 'A Wave,' Ashbery articulated his poetics of
revision: 'I like the idea of being as close to the original thought
or voice as possible and not to falsify it by editing.'  (*Paris Review*
90, Winter 1983, 53).  When working not with a 'thought or voice' but
with pages of written text, Ashbery keeps to the original by keeping new
writing to a minimum.  Rather than changing the fabric of his text by
rewriting or interpolating phrases and lines, Ashbery revises from the
outside by cutting and restitching -- scrapping what doesn't work and
leaving the reconnected pieces relatively intact.  When this method
fails, he starts over with a new original performance.  Thus Ashbery can
revise heavily and still keep close to an, if not the, original.

In Ireland the fate of modernism is also very complicated, partly by the
overwhelming "International Modernist" presence of Joyce.  But certainly
the post-Yeats Irish poet who has gotten the most play in the States
(Heaney) could be called po-mo only by the most elastic of definitions,
and some of the most startlingly experimental (Devlin, Kinsella) are
barely read at all here.  Of course, McGuckian and Muldoon are relatively
well-known, but their language practices are tamed (and partly produced)
by American theoretical discourse.

Regarding Ameslan [American Sign Language] poetry, you might check the
anthology SYMPOSIUM OF THE WHOLE (edited by myself & Diane Rothenberg) for
the article "Poetry without Sound" by Edward S. Klima and Ursual Bellugi.
Bellugi has done terrific work in this area & early contacted me on the
relation of signing poetry to the way in which I and others had been
approaching oral poetry in the course of doing (so called) "total trans-
lation."  Dennis Tedlock and I then published this piece in Alcheringa
(our magazine of ethnopoetics) with my very strong sense that what was
involved touched on a dimension of poetry that made pure oralism inadequate,
however much we had then been (or continued to be) commited to a speech
model.  I made an attempt (around 1976/77) to work out an experimental
approach to a total translation from Ameslan, collaborating with the deaf
poet Joe Castronovo, who was himself a native signer.  But circumstances got
in the way & we never followed through on it, although since then I've come
on the work of performance poets composing in ASL & have been hoping to see
how much further it would go.
 
I'll print out the headnote I wrote for Bellugi piece, in case it's of
interest.
 
Jerome Rothenberg
 
POETRY WITHOUT SOUND.   Even in its early, tentative stages, the signing
poetry emerging as an aspect of the "culture of the deaf" challenges some of
our cherished preconceptions about poetry and its relation to human speech.
Ameslan (American Sign Language) represents, literally, a poetry without
sound and, for its practitioners, a poetry without access to that experience
of sound as voice that we've so often taken as the bedrocks of all poetics
and all language.  In the real world of the deaf, then, language exists as a
kind of writing in space and as a primary form of communication without
reference to any more primary form of language for its validation.  It is
in this sense a realization of the ideogrammatic vision of a Fenollosa -- "a
splendid flash of concrete poetry" -- but an ideogrammatic language truly in
motion and, like oral poetry, truly inseparable from its realization in per-
formance.  (Ethnopoetic analogues -- for those who would care to check them
out -- include Hindu and Tantric mudras, Plains Indian and Australian
Aborigine sign languages, and Ejagham [southeastern Nigerian] "action
writing": a history of human gesture languages that would enrich our sense
of poetry and language, should we set our minds to it.) // The reader may
also want to relate this piece to recent discourse about "written-oral
dichotomies, etc., but the revelation of Ameslan, in that sense, isn't a
denial of the powers of oral poetry but the creation of its possible and
equally impermanent companion in performance.
 
--------
 
A few additional thoughts.  We had around that time seen an extraordinary
performance of Four Saints in Three Acts by the Theater of the Deaf -- a
startling and revelaing interplay between spoken and signed language.  And
I'm remembering too that in Shaking the Pumpkin -- the Indian assemblage I
did in early 70s -- I included a signing piece (& probably compared it to
something or other, altho I'm not going to bother to check).  Also, the
Klima-Bellugi essay didn't originally appear in Alcheringa, but in the
followup magazine, New Wilderness Letter, that I had started up in 1976.  It
remains, anyway, an area of interest, and I'm hoping someone out there may
have information on more recent happenings, etc.  (And, needless to say, the
Klima-Bellugi essay is of much more interest than my intro to it.)

The recent Shoptaw book gets into his process (_On the Outside Looking Out:
John Ashbery's Poetry_ Harvard $24.00 pb geeze). Similar actually to what
Byrd was describing re Olson.
Apparently, he tends to cut more than rewrite, & when cutting doesn't work
he'll write "the same poem" over again. The body of Shoptaw's text contains
quite a bit of discussion of process. There's  also an appendix which
reprints early drafts of "A Wave."
 
Coolidge is another & very good question.

thanks Chris Scheil, cheering up my Tuesday.  The Debord quote is
cute. As a "historian" I'd appreciate it if them intellectuals
realised that "history" is not dead but displaced.  Yesterday, I
said, (and this is without a word of a lie, I swear on my New Mail
Folder, ) the Death of the Author must be "the displacement of the
author".  I should now add "The End of Art" must be the displacement
of  art. Is Ron Silliman (rather than T.Pynchon) the novelist of our
time?
 
Now, there's a historian's question?  Or should it be that a reading
of say Ketjak quickly reaches into the moment of the reader's
on-going fragmentary narrative of what she/he is doing these days and
out to a projection onto the figure of the writer of the book of a
like situation of narration.
 
If "history" proves to be once more no more than narration, however,
displaced, it could supercede the notion of that "history" that old
D.Bored evokes (The Onward March of Time in which our acts are
supposed to be irrevocably immersed as we muse on its telos).
 
The needs of one person for another have not ceased and that means
families and generations and their narratives are forever investing
in narrative, linking presents and pasts and futures. All that is
required to transfer this kind of historicising to more public issues
is the contemplation of the insubstantial but necessary artifices of
narrative.

Purely out of curiosity, I have prepared a questionnaire for private presses.
The purpose of this questionnaire is to discover the nature and behaviour of
private presses as businesses. As an amateur printer, I am interested in how
those who charge for their wares go about doing it. I was inspired by an
article called "The Economics of Printing Limited Editions" which appeared in
"Fine Print" in 1987. If I get a reasonable sample, I may be able to
compile the information in some useful format.
 
Anyway, if anyone is interested in seeing the survey, mail me at

Note that this has nothing to do with Oracle Corporation.

Hello, David Kellogg:
 
How would you say Medbh McGuckian's "language practices" are "tamed"
and/or "partially produced by American theoretical discourse"? I just don't
see it. A fondness for metaphysical abstraction/surreal metaphor, maybe.
Now I'm wondering what you make of Nuala Ni Dhomnhaill.
 
On a different thread: has anyone seen Bunuel's film BELLE DE JOUR?
If so, would you say it was "tamed" and/or "partially produced by"
bourgeois sex fancies? (thanks for the handy formulation, David!) I was
talking with Jonathan Levin about this and we can't figure out if this is an
offensively unselfconscious film or a knowing revolt against its own
quasi-banality
 
From the span of my own movie seat, Scorsese's involvement in its
revival doesn't clarify the situation any!!

It was a toss-off comment, to be sure.  As to what I meant....  I was
thinking about some reviews in American litmags of McGuckian which seemed
to connect almost gleefully to her type of experimentation.  This reaction
I attribute to her confirming (brilliantly I'd hasten to add) certain
reviewer expectations about what an experimental poet should be up to,
expectations themselves fueled by the lit-theory mindset.  Nuala Ni
Dhomnhaill hasn't yet provoked that sort of exhileration among American
reviewers.  It's not a bad thing; please don't think I'm slagging Medbh.
I actually think she's an outrageously good poet.  All I'm saying is that
"theory" is part of her context, and that we might well take into account
the local institutional consequences of that context (how "theory" is
different in Ireland and America, for example) in a transnational literary
environment.

I think the only reason the poem gets mistaken for a representation of
the poet is because writing can come from two places; experience and the
soul.  It is difficult to mask these qualities.  the artist emerges some
where in the middle.

I tend to think the writing comes from any number of places, probably more
than two. Returning to the Ashbery process discussion for a minute. In the
_Code of Signals_ interview he has a useful statement-- "I'm interested in
the way experience filters through me." You could say Cage was interested in
the same thing, he just had a cleaner filter, maybe the cleanest.

. . .a little more on this question of where it ("the writing") comes from.
Perhaps best to say: from multiplicity, through multiplicity, to
multiplicity. Even that too linear. Seems one needs to include contingency
and cognitive limits. I mean the terms "experience" and "soul" could just as
well be "assumptions" and "sensibility"-- neither set of terms telling us all
that much. This is why the gestural, again. To include the contingency, the
not knowing maybe is what makes the beauty. Which is it's own set of
problems.
 
I guess.

          My son, Max, is 9 years old and has been writing stories
          since he was 6.  He has about 9 stories posted at a WWW site
          called KidPub.  At the end of each of his stories is the
          chance to write to Max via my email address.   He's gotten
          about 10 responses and this is how he responded to a
          question on how he came up with his story "World Leaders
          Become Zombies":
 
          "I didn't really get an idea off the top of my head.  It
          just came to me while I was writing the story.  The hardest
          part was trying to think of the title.  What I do with all
          my titles is that I think of a monster like a vampire or
          some other scary creature then I give it a finishing touch."
 
          His response reminded me of a writing process class I had at
          UCSD as an undergraduate.  We read an article that put forth
          the idea that when we write we don't think and then write
          down what we are thinking, we simply write.  I totally
          identified with this idea but the rest of the class thought
          the author had gone Bali Ha'i.

I think the creative process is a drive, a need that I must satisfy,
therefore it makes complete sense(to me anyway) that actual thought is not
the initial element in writing.  Writing is an action, if I just thought
about it I'd never do it.
I once had to go through an interview for an advanced painting class
because I had had no formal training, the prof asked me " Why do you paint?"
I replied, " I don't know I just do, it's something that just happened."
He let me in the class.  I think the same happens in writing.  Children
are the best examplesof this because they haven't been tainted by the
thoery or the philosophy behind the process.

Subject:      Re: teaching
 
There have been, of late, several comments related to issues of
teaching poetry.  As I prepare for a course this Fall in Modern
American Poetry, I've found myself thinking over a few similar
issues.
 
First, I agree with those who have argued for reading aloud in class.
Of course.  Over the years, I have collected a good many audio and
video tapes.  I read aloud in class; the students read aloud in class
(and, presumably, at home).  And I am able to present in class a
reading of poems by the poet.  (And, at times, point out that the
poet has often read a poem aloud, over time, in different ways.)
 
Second issue is, for me, a practical one.  Any recommendations for
how to present Zukofsky?  I have about two weeks set aside, and cost
of books is an issue.  If you were to pick a few things by Z to teach
(to graduate students--most in the MFA program, most of whom will
have read nothing by Z, virtually nothing by Stein or Williams,
probably familiar with Eliot, passing acquaintance maybe with Pound)
what would you teach?
 
Third is a perhaps apocryphal story about Robert Duncan.  I heard the
story nearly 25 years ago, and it concerned the way Duncan allegedly
began a poetry (poetry writing?) class at UC Santa Cruz.  He said
that there would be two basic rules in the course:  1) they would not
be discussing students' poetry in class; 2) he would do almost all of
the talking.  When I frist heard the story, I though, what an
arrogant asshole.  I had begun to take a few writing workshops, and
thought ill of Duncan's anti-democratic rules.  Over the years, I can
see what he may have been doing.  The workshop methodology has indeed
proven to be trivial and narrow--a kind of auto repair approach to
tinkering with the unambitious and tidy poem.  And the students will
inevitably form their most important associations (for discussing
poems too) outside of class among themselves.  Duncan could certainly
meet individually with students to talk over their poems.  And
needless to say, he did have a lot to say.
 
Fourth has to do with the issue that Rod Smith raised about the
importance of teaching via not-knowing.  I offer the following
excerpt from Bob Perelman's fine book _The Trouble with Genius_ (p.
165):
 
But her [Stein's] account of first being invited to teach is
revealing.  The invitation was the result of an angry blowup upon
meeting Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler of the University of
Chicago.  This is the only place I can recall in her work where she
represents herself as losing control.  Adler's list of "all the ideas
that had been important in the world's history" causes Stein first to
get "excited" and then "violent" (EA, 205-7).  She is invited to
teach Adler's class the next week, where, predictably, she triumphs.
Afterward she explains to Hutchins: "You see why they talk to me is
that I am like them I do not know the answer, you you say you do not
know but you do know if you did not know the answer you could not
spend your life in teaching but I I really do not know ... that is
the trouble with governments and Utopia and teaching, the things not
that can be learnt but that can be taught are not interesting" (EA,
213).
 
I'd be very curious to hear how others go about basing their teaching
on what they don't know.  Or how various ones of you balance teaching
between an orientation toward a "delivery" of what you know and a
shared exploration of what you don't know.  Personally, I hope that
Stein is wrong.  It is, I hope, possible to sustain a career in
teaching precisely by basing that activity in a substantial amount of
not knowing.  (Though such an approach has a great capacity to annoy
and baffle some students.)  If not--if Stein's right--my career's
about over....

--ironic--have been reading MHAbrams mirror and lamp (comps!) all day to
day, and here we are rehashing what we have been since Aristotle, Plato,
et.al. . . .  MHA employes a triangle, something like this:
 
                                UNIVERSE
 
                                 WORK
 
                          ARTIST         AUDIENCE
 
Arrows point up from work to universe, and down from work to artist and
audience, implying that the work (writing) mediates between the artist
and the audience.
I would argue that in todays postmodern writing, thinking, criticism,
being, the arrows would all have to be double.  That is to say all of
these elements mediate one upon--for and against--the other.
 
Where does writing come from--my soul/your soul, my experience/your
experience--today I am working on a poem about Appolo, the sun, my skin,
and knowledge--where does this come from?  Partly a centuries old myth--a
work (and does that include the soul, experience, whatever of its author,
lost to us (except in this text) forever?  And his/her audience?
Universe?)--it "works" on me--
 
I like that!  I like to think of writing as labor--and now I can add work
to that, too!
 
Best,
ShaunAnne

off the top thinking of Hank Lazer and teaching. (the G Stein episode
is fascinating, I must get hold of Perelman's book) :  monologue is often
 useful as a delivery style, yes, but always seems
most useful when it is made plain at some point that it stems from a
reading that has posed questions that cannot be finally layed to rest
by anyone....announcing "I wish I knew,( or that I could know, or
could think of a way to find out") is a way of
asking for collaborative effort over a question, seeking help,
proposing "research"....monologue can be useful to put questions and
to put into the "class" a summary of the story so far...I wonder
whether it is a useful approach to teaching to propose that its
purpose is to induct or introduce students to a continuing dialogue
over certain questions with uncertain answers....I have enjoyed
working this way with students in recent years....this list actually
suggests a model....talking with Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett
(folklorist) in New York, she showed me her computer operation
 in which she and her students shared a list-server ( I believe) so that
 there was a continuing discussion going on electronically among the class
members. I liked that a lot.  A bulletin-board for paper equivalents
is ok, but the electronic version seems to me very useful....
 
I'd like to hear (as this list often says) what otheres think about
this....

Hank,
 
People learn when they do. thus students must have their say (no matter how
stupid or awkward what they say is) and their sayings must be honored but
still can be emended, amended AMENed etc.
 
so I am saying what is old hat, but there, i've said it just the same.
I like to teach stuff I don'tunderstand; i know more than my students
though I may not be as smart as some of them; they sense that we are
all exploring together and get confident. and in fact I have learned
some amazing stuff from them.
 
again,I 'm saying the old things here, but . . .
 
My Zukofsky all time hit parade:
 
A "11". "Little Wrists," the Don Giovanni poem, and "Mantis"--I don't
pretend to be a Zuk scholar and have not read it all. Ahearn's book
would seem a good starting place for grad students to read.
 
And how about Mike Heller's *Conviction's Net of Branches*
 
and how about the Man and pOet.

Only from those two places?
 
But then, of course, that begs the question of what, if anything, the
word "soul" might mean.

In some senses (pardon the pun) and not in others.  There may be an actual
physical silence in reading, but I always experience an inner voice reading
"aloud" to me, as it were, so I don't experience it as silent.  But then
again, there is the silence from which all sound arises that I am sometimes
aware of (if I'm being mindful and relaxed).
 
I still wonder if people deaf from birth can "hear" sound in their mind
somewhere, or is this a manifestation of phonocentrism?

suppose you ask deaf people if they "hear" something in their minds and they
say yes. how do you know that what they call hearing is what you call hearing.
wondering if deaf people "hear", isn't it like like wondering if what you call red is seen by other people as what you
call green?  it is one of those things.
 
is there a foreign language of which you have only a reading knowledge? what
happens to you when you read poetry in that language?  do you hear an inner

Subject:      Non-linear Prosody Article
 
Well, I've decided to post this; apologies if the length offends anyone.  A
good half of this at least is directly relevant to recent discussions here
on prosody, and the hypertext part may be interesting to some.  Some of what
I am saying here directly echoes [prefigures?] what George Bowering had to
say about foot, though in somewhat more detail.
 
A few caveats.  Since I wrote this, the word "agency" has generated a good
deal of discomfort, and I'm not sure I'm crazy about it myself, but I haven't
yet thought of a better word, so I've left it in.  There is a passing
reference here to "conjunctive hypertext"; this is a concept I introduced at
the European Conference on Hypermedia Technology last fall (detail in
http://www.well.com/user/jer/NNHI.html); to make a long story very short,
conjunctive hypertext is hypertext where the components have a logical relation
of "and" to one another rather than "or" (you can choose this link *or* that
one, etc.) -- I can explain this in more detail if need be, but this
article is already long enough.
 
This was originally posted to ht_lit, which is a list for literary hypertext.

              Notes Toward a Non-linear Prosody of Space
 
I.  Linear Metrics
 
1.  Background:  Dimensions of inequality among syllables
 
The fundamental axiom of prosody in English is that all syllables are not
created equal.  (This is not the case in all languages; in Japanese,
apparently, syllables are considered equal enough, metrically, that they are
simply counted rather than being distinguished by structural patterns.)  By
plotting the time sequence of how these inequalities occur one obtains
metrics -- a double plural, meaning a multitude of metrics.  The most well
known is the stress degree metric, which forms most of the discussion below,
but there are several others.  (1) Pitch Degrees.  Although I have not
analyzed this in detail, there is a prosody at work in many American
communities, most notably in a style of reading in the black community, in
which I believe *pitch degrees* play a more important role than stress
degrees.  This forms the basis of an incredibly rich prosody, a different
prosody than the classical one, which must be analyzed on its own terms.
Whereas stress is a linguistic property, pitch is a purely acoustical
property; thus a pitch degree prosody is more absolutely musical -- in a
literal sense -- than a stress degree prosody.  A pitch degree prosody is
more free to use an absolute musical sense of time and structure; the sound
structure balance is different -- not all phonemes carry pitch.  Where a
pitch degree prosody and a stress degree prosody are present at the same
time, incredibly subtle effects are possible. Pitch degree prosody deserves
extensive analysis in its own right.
 
(2) Vowel Position Degrees.  Again, my impressions here are based on
intuition rather than detailed analysis.  My understanding of this goes back
to a somewhat delphic comment by Robert Duncan.  Duncan spoke often of "tone
leading vowels" in talking about Pound.  Not understanding what he meant by
this, but wanting to know more, at a reading once I asked him where in
Pound's writings I could find the discussion of tone leading vowels.  To my
total astonishment, he replied that it *wasn't anywhere*; Pound had used the
term in letters to Duncan, simply assuming that Duncan would understand what
he meant; Duncan was left to figure it out for himself.  Hearing this I
simply couldn't resist: "Well, what is it??"  Duncan said two things, one of
which was quite straightforward, the other of which was extremely obscure. He
explained that when a diphthong (a glide from one "pure vowel" to another)
occurs, the "leading tone", i.e. the pure vowel at which the glide begins,
plays a special role in terms of later reinforcement.  So far so good.  Then
he said: "When you hear a sound, it's reinforced when you hear it again.  But
it can also be reinforced when you *don't* hear it again."  Just as Duncan
was left to figure out on his own what Pound meant by "tone leading vowels",
I felt strongly that I should simply accept this remark as a gift and work on
my own to figure out what it meant; I didn't ask anything else.
 
I certainly don't wish to be in the business of interpreting Robert Duncan,
even less interpreting Duncan interpreting Pound; but the train of thought
that started with Duncan's remark has ended up with the idea of a vowel
position degree metric.  Vowels are sometimes diagrammed as a trapezoid which
plots the position of the tongue in the mouth.  I believe (again this is
based on intuition, not analysis) that the possible vowel positions tend to
cluster into just a few groupings, and that the plot of which grouping occurs
at a given moment forms a metric.  This metric is probably superimposed on
the stress degree metric, again giving a very fluid effect.  (I don't know if
this has anything at all to do with "tone leading vowels", but I certainly do
hear something like this frequently when I read or listen to Pound.)
 
2.  The Classical Stress-Degree Metric Stereotype
 
Before giving my own approach to the stress-degree metric, let me briefly
sketch the stereotype most people have for how this works.  If you want to
argue that the stereotype is not accurate in scanning this or that poet, I
would hardly disagree; but I think this stereotype does have a lot to do with
attitudes towards metrics.  Hopefully, by presenting a different approach,
the stereotype can be broken.
 
There exist -- a priori, in advance of any particular poems -- a collection
of abstract patterns of stress degrees.  These patterns may be called
*templates*.  They tend to have names, e.g. iamb ('|), trochee (|'), anapest
(|'') etc.  (I'm using ' for an unstressed syllable, | for a stress.)
*Scanning* is an activity consisting of pattern-matching template instances
against the words of the poem.  In the most formalized case, we say a line
"scans" if repeated instances of the same template, end to end, match against
the words of the line.  There is a tendency to speak of poets "writing in" a
meter, which means choosing a template in advance and writing lines which
will scan to that template.
 
Readers familiar with prosody terminology may note with some surprise that so
far I have not mentioned the word 'foot'.  Unfortunately, the word 'foot' is
deeply ambiguous:  It has at least two wildly different uses in prosody.
Because I believe this plays a crucial role in the widespread prejudice
against and misunderstanding of metrics by many people, I want to explain
this in detail, and will propose a different terminology to avoid the
problem. Meanings of the word 'foot':  (1) 'Foot' is often used to designate
*a type of template*.  (E.g. one speaks of "an iamb".)  As such it is part of
an a priori scheme, given in advance of the poem.  (2) 'Foot' is used to
designate the group of syllables *in the actual poem* which is matched by one
of the templates.  In this usage, a foot is a unit of meter:  just above the
syllable, which is the atomic unit for metrics, and below the metric line.
(Of course this is not meant to deny that a foot can contain just one
syllable or a line one foot.)  I.e. here foot is a living breathing part of
the poem, with a specific tangible identity in a metrical structure.
 
Many different strains in poetics, such as the Open Forms of the Black
Mountain poets and Improvisational Composition of the beats, have led in
directions away from the a priori, away from choosing a fixed form given in
advance.  Because the concept of 'foot' is so closely linked with a system of
a priori templates, this has led to a sad neglect of metrics generally, and
to interest in the concept of mapping the metrical structure of living
breathing poems specifically.  To avoid this problem, in what follows I will
use the term *measure* for a unit of meter intermediate between the syllable
and the line where we make no assumption in advance for what shape a measure
may take.
 
3.  Bonding Strength
 
I wish to propose yet another dimension along which syllables can vary:
bonding strength.  Actually bonding strength applies not to syllables but to
the boundaries between adjacent syllables.  Before going into the details of
how this works, it is important to note two important points about this
methodology.  (1) The methodology applies against *the sound* of the poem. In
some cases this may be difficult to infer from a printed text absent a live
or recorded reading by the poet.  This idea will be quite threatening to
those academics who believe that all there is to know about a poem is
contained in the printed text.  However, there is nothing terribly original
in the idea that prosody means looking at the structure of *the sound*:  it
was Ezra Pound who said if you want to know about the prosody, open up your
ears and listen to the sound it makes.  (2) The methodology -- and I
emphasize that it is a *methodology*, not a theory! -- is ruthlessly
empirical.  It works by examining a recitation and trying to answer the
question:  what is the metrical structure of this recitation.  It may or may
not yield useful results for any given recitation.  It is not designed to
answer what may be a fallacious question -- what meter did the poet "write
in" -- but simply to discover whatever metrical structure happens to be
there.  Because poets build a voice, there is a reasonable chance that in
many cases conclusions can be drawn about metrical structure, but perhaps
not.
 
Each syllable has a *bonding strength* for the syllable before it and after
it.  By bonding strength is meant:  (artificially) inject a pause at the
syllable boundary in question, and then judge how natural the pause is
against the recitation.  There will be different degrees of naturalness --
different degrees of resistance to the injection of pause -- at different
syllable boundaries.  We say a syllable boundary has a high bonding strength
if an injected pause is extremely unnatural compared to the recitation; where
the pause is natural (or already there, of course) bonding strength is low. I
will call a *measure* a string of syllables bounded on either side by low
bonding strength and having only high bonding strength in any internal
syllable boundaries.  It is this empirical, overtly sound-based concept of
measure which I wish to use as a replacement for usage (2) of 'foot' above.
 
Of course this will work with any recitation; it does not have to be poetry.
I propose that the speech rhythm of English prose tends toward what I will
call *The Standard Measure*, defined by the following rules:  (1) A measure
has only one major stress; (2) the stress tends to come at the end of the
measure, but (3) if there are only unstressed syllables following the major
stress out to the end of a natural grammatical boundary, those syllables will
be incorporated into the measure.  (You can think of this as an attempt to
reformulate the classical idea that English is "predominantly iambic" while
institutionalizing the counter-examples.)  The concept of "grammatical
boundary" is really the same concept of bonding strength applied to syntax.
Although I haven't analyzed this in detail, a simple explanation would relate
grammatical bonding strength to the distance that must be traveled in a parse
tree to get the closest common antecedent to two consecutive words.
 
This is not to say that "the standard measure" will in fact always occur.
Robert Creeley, for instance, is well known for having many non-standard
measure breaks in his poems, and many other poets use non-standard measure
breaks quite prominently.  Detailed analysis can produce some interesting
results.  For instance, in some of Creeley's poems, lines are predominantly
either one or two measures; interestingly in the two-measure lines the
internal measure boundary is a *standard* measure break.  (I.e. the
celebrated Creeley line-break is exactly that, a line-break, not a measure-
break.)  The non-standard measure boundaries are easy to hear, but the
internal standard measure boundaries do not stand out so prominently.  (Of
course you would "hear their absence" as a lifeless regularity.)  In these
poems one could say that the grammatical structure goes from the middle of
one line to the middle of the next; but the line endings are articulated
sonically by the prominent non-standard measure boundaries.  This is a
familiar metrical structure going back hundreds of years, all the way to
Anglo-Saxon poetry.
 
II.  Non-linear Metrics
 
Prosody is traditionally the study of poetic sound structure as mapped in
time.  Because of the inherent linearity of time, this poses an obvious
problem for non-linear poetry.  Shall we say that prosody only applies within
the lexia, thus punting the problem completely?  Some may take this view, but
I find it personally distasteful.  It exempts from prosody details of
hypertext structure which I think clearly need to be considered.  In Michael
Joyce's work, the names of links are so clearly musical it takes one's breath
away: they are part of the prosody.  Given that I am on record as advocating
taking hypertext into the fine structure of language, thereby fragmenting the
lexia, I simply can't accept leaving prosody as an inherently linear concept
that applies only *inside* of lexia.
 
It would be nice if what follows were as well worked out as what preceded,
but at this point I have only questions and some launching points for a view
of non-linear prosody.
 
1.  Linear prosody as a prosody of *space*
 
There are some concepts in prosody that are so overtly time-based that one
simply has to give up on them in non-linear poetry.  Isochrony -- the
tendency of major stresses to fall in an even musical beat -- is one such
concept.  There may be isochrony within the lexia, but given that outside the
lexia *there is no concept of time*, in non-linear prosody one can only treat
isochrony locally.  However:  In a one-dimensional structure, time and space
are very nearly the same thing.  What may appear to be a time-based concept
may in fact be a space-based concept.  The concept of bonding strength, as
articulated above, occurs between *adjacent* syllables.  'Adjacent' is
clearly a spatial concept, not a time-based concept.  I defined bonding
strength as the resistance by a recitation to the injection of an artificial
*pause* -- time language again -- but one could just as well speak of
injecting space into the poem as time.  Thus:
 
2.  Spatial Bonding Strength
 
The concept of bonding strength works in any kind of topology.  One may speak
of the bonding strength of two adjacent units as their resistance to the
injection of artificial space.  The replacement for the concept of measure
above is a *spatial clustering*.  This has some interesting consequences for
"traditional" hypertext rhetoric.  Whereas the classical hypertext link is
typically discussed using travel vocabulary, a spatial prosody would ask the
question:
 
What is the bonding strength *THROUGH* the link?
 
(This has an interesting resonance with the Kaplan/Moulthrop concept of
hypertext warping space.)  It may be objected that in trying to assess
bonding strength through the link, one is reversing the direction of the
arrow (assuming a one-directional link, and recalling Ted Nelson's caution
that *all* links should really be bidirectional).  Well, having no problem
measuring bonding strength "against" the arrow of time in linear poetry, I
have no problem doing the same thing "against" the arrow of the link.  Travel
may be the right vocabulary to use, but one can also speak of the
*attraction* of two nodes for one another; yes, there may be an asymmetry in
link direction, but there is always an asymmetry between "located here" and
"could be located there".  In discussing hypertext there is an overt tendency
to discuss following links based on *similarity* to where one is; but perhaps
not!  Perhaps one wants to take a link based on *dissimilarity* to where one
is!  (Robert Duncan:  "A sound is reinforced when it is *not* heard again
...")
 
Prosody may form an overt basis for following links.  I find myself following
links in Michael Joyce's work based on sound structure all the time.  Perhaps
I'm "not supposed to do that", but I do, and without having asked him about
this I think Michael wouldn't mind that I do.
 
Prosody must work *THROUGH* links, not just inside "the lexia" (if one has
lexia ...)
 
I speak about "links" here only because that is the most familiar form of
hypertext structure; this discussion generalizes to conjunctive structures as
well.
 
3.  Agencies
 
By "agency" I mean a *unit of doing*.  Because there is an overt structure
resulting from hypertext linkage, we have a bit of a tendency to focus on
that structure rather than the structure of what the reader *does*.  Consider
the familiar node/link/lexia model.  A reader follows a series of links, then
-- for whatever reason -- decides to backtrack.  That series of nodes is a
*unit of doing*.  Unfortunately, most of the software does not treat it that
way.  For instance I can't *save the series*.  Perhaps I can save my entire
history, but I typically can't *mark it* to denote the way I think the links
clump together.  Perhaps the best I may be able to do is save my history to a
text file and then import it into some tool where I can annotate it.
 
Doing has boundaries, has a shape, has units.  The structure of doing unfolds
against the skeleton of the hypertext structure, but it may not be the same.
The hypertext structure may appear to be disjunctive, but the reader can *do*
conjunctive things with it anyway.  (E.g.: "*These* are the links I really
like, they seem to work together ...)  In a hypertext with conventional
lexia, there is a concept of bonding strength among lexia.
 
When I speak of agency, I am *not* speaking of *history*.  Agency and history
are related but are not the same. The structure of history is relentlessly
linear:  "this is the sequence of what happened ..."; the structure of agency
is likely not to be linear.  There will be clusters of doing that include the
same event.  Some agencies will stand out clearly in the reader's mind; these
may clump together even though they are isolated in time by navigations that
don't stand out in the reader's mind as a clear agency:  agencies don't
always happen.
 
4.  The Granularity of Agency
 
We have, perhaps, come far afield of prosody.  I am propounding a view of
linear prosody as clustering in one-dimensional space; from this one
generalizes to clustering in a space of arbitrary topology.  The granularity
of this clustering as it traditionally affects prosody is very fine:  down to
the level of the syllable.  A hypertext prosody granularity of space can
become this fine only when hypertext is taken into the fine structure of
language.  I am always (it seems) advocating for this, but with few takers at
present.  With a more "traditional" lexia, there is a "granularity boundary"
concerning units of prosody that are inside the lexia vs. those that
transcend the lexia.  Is the poetic lexia a stanza?  Is it a line?  Is it yet
larger than the stanza?  Even I would balk at taking hypertext inside the
*word*.  The words are given to us, by and large; it does not seem reasonable
to me to intervene in that natural process with an external administration of
hypertext structure.  It should be noted that in the discussion of linear
prosody above, the "standard" speech rhythm of English does not interpose
measure boundaries inside the word either.  If I will not intervene inside
the word with hypertext structure, and the natural rhythm of English does not
intervene inside the word, that leaves the entire measure in a hypertext
context likely to be linear.  At its finest granularity, hypertext structure
relates measures.
 
In the large, the structure of agency extends to the *session*.  While surely
multiple sessions will associate in the mind of the reader, just as there is
a natural limit at the measure boundary -- even though measures contain still
smaller units, namely syllables -- there is a natural boundary at the large
end of the granularity of agency at the session.  You have a well defined cut
in doing when you sign off, surely.  As obvious as this sounds, there is
still a great deal of work to be done in understanding what the identity of
the session should be.  Hypertexts tend often to be large; it can take many
sessions before the reader even begins to get a feel for how a particular
hypertext "is supposed to work".  Because the number of paths is genuinely
infinite, the reader may have no help at all in deciding when a session
should end.
 
Shall we say as writers, overtly and explicitly, that we *want* the reader to
compose a structure of agency?  Shall we say that even if the writer does not
want the reader to do this, readers will want to anyway?
 
It seems the prosody of hypertext needs new terminology.  I am comfortable
with the terms syllable/word/measure/lexia, but up from there the familiar
terminology breaks down completely.
 
5.  Multiplicity of Agency
 
There are clearly multiple concurrent agencies in a multiuser hypertext that
is being used by several users at once.  An interesting rhetorical question
arises from this:  do we need to discuss multiplicity of agency in the
context of a single reader reading a single hypertext?  Put differently this
is the question:  How does a single mind apprehend a network?  Must one
simulate multiple concurrent agencies in one's own mind?  (It is interesting
to note in this regard that some theorists of mind -- notably Dennett -- have
proposed that despite the illusion that the mind is a singular stream of
agency, in fact the mind *is* a multiplicity of concurrent agencies.)
 
Many in the hypertext community will surely object that in this whole
discussion so far, I have spoken as if reader and writer are different people
-- i.e. the hypertext is "closed".  It seems reasonable to me to entertain
the idea that writing and reading are *separate agencies* even if done by the
same person in a single session.  Writing-as-reading simply becomes yet
another dimension to the structure of agency.
 
Concluding Question:
 
How do we -- or do we at all -- *code* the hypertext for the structure of
agency?

Re: Hank Lazer's question about teaching Zukofsky.
 
I taught Zukofsky recently in a ten-week (quarter) course--short
space!--where we read about 8 poets.  I didn't have more than 2 weeks for
Zuk either.  We read ALL and then (xeroxed) just portions of "'A'" and at
least that whetted their appetite and many of the students (incl. Susan
Vandenborg, Ming-Quian Ma) went on to work on Zukofsky.  The short poems
in ALL are really challenging for them.
 
As for reading aloud, yes,--but I am the one who does most of the
reading.  And as to tapes:  I don't like to use class time (so limited)
to listen but try to get the students to do so.  Or attend the readings

re charles alexander's post about teaching poetry/reading it aloud; while i do
have students read poems aloud in class, i also make undergrads attend at least
one poetry event of their choosing during the course of the quarter.  for many,
it's the first time they've ever done such a thing, and it seems to have an
impact that reading a poem aloud in a classroom doesn't have.  it shows them the
degree to which poetry is embodied not only in "voice" or sound, but in a social
atmosphere/context, in a particular voice and sound, in a particular body, in
the interaction between voice/presence of reader and audience, setting (bar or
lecture hall or bookstore, etc).  i also show videos.  having a great time in
boulder though it's all somewhat overwhelming, having lived in 3 places in 2
weeks, and missing my cats and my privacy.  finally got to see robin blaser,
it's helping to abate my fest-envy of last month.--md

Hello Burt, David et al:
 
Medbh (pronounced maeve) McGuckian and Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill (she
pronounces that something like Noola Nee Gonal... my apologies for the
awful phonetics here) are friends but very different poets currently
writing in Ireland-- Nuala in Dublin and Medbh in Belfast (I think) when not
seaside. Nuala writes in Irish-- she discusses that in a January 8 1995
piece in the NYTimes BookReview-- and her stuff is usually presented
bilingually; she has a selected poems called SELECTED POEMS: ROGHA DANTA
(tr. Michael Harnett, from Raven Arts Press).  Medbh's last book is
called CAPTAIN LAVENDER-- but I think her best so far is MARCONI'S COTTAGE.
 
My friend Laura O'Connor is writing about the colonial tensions animating
Yeats's poems and she helped me hear the same in Nuala's stuff-- it's not
hard, what with strategic leavings of certain words in English (there is
no Irish for 'Black &Decker'...) When David Kellogg said they were
writing against a context of American lit theory, postcolonial theory was
all I could think of as relevent, though the wisdom is flowing east to
west there and not vice versa.
 
I would rather be reading a poem by each *out loud* than trying to explain
for instance the sexual, abstract ceremonies of metaphor constituting Medbh's
poems, the tough/ready mythic acoustics in Nuala's.
 
Neither is quite the Iowa poet (Chris?!) that Eavan Boland's become,
though I like her work too (in small doses)
 
Bye----

--oh shoot, i'm here in boulder, can't remember the name, starts with an A.  it
came out before middle passages, has some stuff from The Arrivants, and other
than a long and rambling introduction by carolivia herron, is a magnificent

Thanks for the great post, Hank Lazar... the remarks teaching from
'unknowing' remind me strongly of an article by Barbara Johnson in the
Yale French Studies pedagogy issue, where she uses the RIME OF THE
ANCIENT MARINER to articulate a productive pedagogy of... gapsmanship
(sorry!! it's been years).  You might enjoy it.
 
In what we each know, we're unequal, but in the face of the vastness of
what we don't we're properly equal
 
For all that I know I was squeamish about issues of power and
'discipline' when I began to teach, but sometimes I think in all
seriousness that students need to feel they're experiencing 'training'
(to see "with" before seeing "through" the pretenses entailed in teaching
as a managed activity)
 
In other words, Vicki Hearne, not Yale French Studies!
 
Flame on!!  I care too much about the subject to be shy here.

As well as going to poetry readings, a great hit and a joy for all is
bringing real honest to live poets to class and just let them do what
they want to do for however long.  Most of my students hadn't been aware
that there were local poets who write about local issues in local
voices.  A tremendous poet and very emotional in her reading, Mahealani
Kamauu, had us all crying.  She works with a lot of Native Hawaiian
prisoners.  I don't think my stduents had realized that poetry is
actually written by people who breathe and cry.  One of the people I
asked to come was the same age as my students.
 
I completely agree about the teaching what we don't know.  I used to be
frightened by how much I don't know but now see it as whta makes the
class come alive.  Of course all this backed by everything I do
know--just because I've lived so much longer than most of teh people I'm
teaching.

I teach a different course every semester that I teach, and always
put on books that I have never taught before, and always at least one
that I have not read. One of the best courses was one I gave in 20thC
stuff in Montreal years ago; it was ALL made of texts I didnt know,
and I let this be known when the course started, and I guess there
were some students who thought I was conning them. Started with
Joyce's _Exiles_ and went from there. We all learned a lot that term.

I wish the old Grossman "A" 22-23 was still available. That would have
been the perfect teaching text for LZ (it's perhaps the best poetry he
ever wrote as well).
 
I had a great experience a year ago at Naropa working hard with the
students to define the core values of their own writing processes
(first a discussion of "how do you write" then one of "how do you
really write" that went into pen vs. computer, kind of paper, time of
day, location, whether other people were around, etc, etc, then had
them all write a single word on a 3x5 card of what, once you removed
all else, was the single thing you would find in their poems (my
favorite answer was "pivot"). Then I had them do work that left that
out (and which violated all the terms of their methodologies).
 
Teach what you don't know is a pretty good program
Write what you don't know is likewise

I dunno, about 30 some years ago Duncan was speaking of a "scale of

Subject:      doing the one-two writing/teaching
 
Two questions lately posed to this list seem inextricably intertwined: That of
"whence writing comes" [an apparent mystery] & that of "how to teach from
ignorance" [an apparent absurdity].  To begin with the second, by way of
implicitly talking of the first, Marx comes in handy.  In "Contribution to
Critique," he configures a certain kind of critic, one who "PRACTICALLY
interests a large party" by not "confronting the world dogmatically with a new
principle: 'Here is the Truth, kneel before it," but instead by "developing new
principles for the world out of principles of the world."
 
[when writing, this world is writing.  and despite the language, this need not
be a tauntology.  and, by the by, experience finds its way in both these
worlds, too]
 
When teaching, I also find that what I have least mastered is precisely that
which comes in most handy.  I especially like taking the transparent,
ignorable, everyday as the place to most incite suspicion, or critique.  And by
using everyday materials (e.g. pop culture), it is most easy to interest a
large party, one as conflictually heterogeneous as possible.
 
Teaching [writing] is an extreme battle over the modes of cultural recognition,
and as such, marks "humanity's" very problematic, and entangled, relation to
temporality.  As Walter Benjamin remarks in _One Way Street_:
 
"The mastery of nature, so imperialists teach, is the purpose of all
technology.  But who would trust a cane-wielder who proclaimed the mastery of
children to be the purpose of education? Is not education above all the
indespensible ordering of the relationship between generations and therefore
mastery, if we are to use that term, of that relationship and not of children?
and likewise technology is not the mastery of nature but of the relation of
nature and man."
 
The subject of mastery, that upon which it WORKS, is not isolated to those
 "natures" supposedly distinct from "man" (or, metaphorically,
the student).  The subject of mastery is in fact the recognition (or
non-recognition) of the irreparably entangled, and mutually constituting,
relation between both.  Thus, pedagogy's site of control and co-ordination,
that upon which its power is exerted, is not that which it ostensibly
addresses--students--but instead generational recognition itself--the
continuity and contiguity of what is recognized as "man."  In the cane-weilding
case, mastery is "man's" attempt to (re)member "himself" as self-same, as
owning or possessing what is seen as "his" "nature."  The drive to order is a
drive both to map a field of recognition and a drive to mask
 the interlocked relations of these multifarious natures.
Paradoxically, or perhaps not too surprisingly, this supposed mastery steps in
precisely where these relations are beyond a controllable play of recognition.
 
[and I would add: the word "soul" is a dangerous way to step in precisely where
the relations of sender/addressee, me/I, spirit/text are beyond a controllable
play of recognition, that in fact to designate them as such, is to suture what
is essentially problematic & conflictual about these relations, and to likewise
suture the "drive to writing" itself]

Hmm.
I disagree, or I agree with a corollary: poets are just poets. The set of
poets can include the subset of children who write poetry. Viz. Smart Like
Me, and Bullseye from Hanging Loose Press, two pretty good collections of
poetry by "writers of high school age." (Especially good are the poems by
Jendi Reiter and Alissa Quart.)

This is a reply to Steve Carll's posting of July 11 (on silence).  I'm new to
 this list and a bit shy so I thought I'd just offer a quote from Lorine
Niedecker on the subject:  "Nobody, nothing/ever gave me/greater thing/than

Guess what, kids?  It doesn't even have to be "great" writing.  Have
          you heard the new San Diego Padres slogan (since they gutted
          the team of "great" players?): "Hey, it's baseball."  Well,
          "Hey, it's writing!"  A kid is a kid is a kid.  A kid who
          kids is a kidder.  A kid who writes is a writer.  I worked
          with a whole classroom of 8 and 9 year old writers this past
          school year.  I agree with Jordan, the set of poets includes
          the subset of ANYONE who writes poetry. And, beyond that,
          anyone who writes knows something about the writing process
          and can contribute to the dialogue. Even people who are "not
          qualified," such as kids.

yay.  this is what i like to see on the list.  i've started, since my visit to
albany for a conference i found very exciting but nonetheless felt like an
outsider at, to feel somewhat embarrassed about my populist orientations vis a
vis poetry --like a yahoo or something, or a cheap "culti-multuralist" (to crib
from fusco and gomez-pena) which isn't where i think i'm coming from.

It's a good question because it makes people effulgent, or they
cringe. Some people can, and some people can't, talk about it without
blushing, or making apologies for saying it.
Isn't the soul one of the organs of experience itself, like the
intellect and the body? There are (at least) five senses belonging to
the body, all of which are wired simultaneously to intellect and
soul, which are wired to each other, and the whole damn system hums

Hello, all--
 
As many of you know from my posts, I am studying for my comps right now,
and as many of you also know from a very recent post, I am currently
reading MHAbrams _The Mirror and the Lamp_ (almost done!).  While I
certainly cannot accept TMATL as a manifesto--and indeed don't think it
was intended to be--it is a great little book in that is concisely and
coherently brings together ALL of 19th C. poetics.
My question: Do any of you out there know of a book that does this for
20th C. poetics?  I find myself making suibstantial marginalia "cf pomo",
but it would be so nice if I had a "source book" of the 20th C. to
quickly refer to!
 
Thanks in advance,
ShaunAnne

Dear Hank Lazer:
 
When I had the chance to teach Zuk, I found it fascinating to teach
"Poem Beginning 'The'" as a kind of Jewish, leftist, American anti-
"Waste Land" (which seems to be pretty much how Zuk thought of it).
Now I say *I* found it fascinating, but I'm not sure I really had
enough to time to both introduce my beginning students to Eliot and
provide a way into Zuk's equally dense and unfamiliar poem.  It
would probably take several weeks to do this right.  And oh yes,
I also taught Martin Rowson's clever and hilarious graphical (i.e.
sophisticated comic book) "Waste Land," which crosses Eliot with
Raymond Chandler (so that Christopher Marlowe goes in search of
answers to Eliotic conundrums).  I got a surprising, or not so
surprising, resistance from many of the students to the very idea
of parodying the Waste Land.  Even though they didn't know the
poem, they knew of it, were ready for a serious dose of High
Culture, and were rather offended when the course didn't present
Eliot in those terms.  As you acknowledge elsewhere in your post,
students are often heavily invested in you, the teacher, having the
answers.  Perhaps even more, they want Literature to have the
answers, and want you to "channel" them--the teacher as direct
pipeline to the mysteries of Culture.
 
The Stein anecdote gives a delightful take on all this.  I also
taught "Lifting Belly" to that same class.  It seems to me an
interesting exercise to ask students to imagine Stein or Zuk as
occupying that modernist cultural "center" ususally given over to
Eliot--still interesting even if your intent is not really to
propose any one new centering.
 
As I said, tho, I'm not sure how good a job i really did with
"The," and i haven't yet had a chance to try it again.  My most
successful Zukofskyan teaching venture, then, has probably been
using "Mantis," and "'Mantis': An Interpretation."  The sestina
form provides a recognizable way into Zuk's habitual mental and
linguistic "torsion," the clarity of the actual physical encounter
and the poem's moral imperatives shine through its difficulties,
and comparing the original poem with its poetic "interpretation"
provides useful grounds for talking about what makes a poem a poem
anyway.
 
Hope this helps,
steve shoemaker
 
PS.
 
I hope you'll either post your results or back-channel me when you
teach Zuk in the fall.

Yes! Leave it to Lorine. I think this woman INVENTED the space between words.
 
But which better expresses her silence: reading the poem aloud so as to
'hear' the silences, defined by the sounds of the words; or to not read
the poem aloud at all?
 
Admittedly her poems are musical and thus demand to be spoken; but on the
other hand, when I read poems I 'hear' the voice in my head, perfectly.
 
What is silence anyway? Is it merely lack of sound?

maria, your question brought to mind earlier comments on duchamp
and chance a while back. duchamp said something similar re good art and
bad art: it's still art. in regrads to duncan, i love what he says abt
seeing himself as a derivative poet, abt writing and adding to the
tradition. one long, long poem.

   dear md---what would happen if took seriously duncan's dictim may be
   actually what happens now, depending on who the "we" is (no doubt)
   --that people would read poetry that moves them and poetry that doesn't,
   that they wouldn't know what moves them until they read it,
   and perhaps all poetry (even if we take the widest possible sense of
   it) moves one--but to disgust sometimes. And if a poem moves one to
   disgust, need we call it bad--not necessarily if it's what one needs--
   and so all these notions of "interpretive communities" does not work
   for a lot of people. Perhaps no two are alike--for, in the abstract,
   we may all "marry" "high culture" and "low culture" in various, conflicting
   ways--yet, even if we all decided to call ourselves "populists" there'd
   no doubt be disagreements about the virtues of WHICH "low art" we find
   ourselves more drawn to--and most likely disagree with ourselves--
   "Why did I like THAT in 1987?" etc.
   And, it's only if we inflexibly and dogmatically claim a certain
   definite zone, draw a certain line in the sand (and I'm not saying that
   I don't find myself doing that provisionally for "academic career reasons"
   and a "research project" that I sometimes believe actually fulfills
   a "real need"--Or should I say "feel" instead of "believe"), that
   terms like "good" and "bad" matter. I am a GOOD person. I am married
   to a GOOD person but a have a BAD job. Rejecting the terms "good"
   and "bad" (if not "evil") may be something aspires to, and may be the
   the "ideal condition" good and bad lurk behind, playing dead. But
   when you are drowning in the ocean a shark is definitely "bad" and
   a liferaft "good" (unless, of course....) Chris

And isn't the fact that it's all so natural one of the reasons we
don't value such things very much? They've got to grow up, go to school and
have all that natural ability pounded out of them and then earn it back
inch by inch. That's when appreciation of their efforts really begins.

good point.  So how do I know if you and I are talking about the same thing
when we're using the word "hearing"?  At what point can we make the
epistemological "call" and assume we're communicating?

The inner voice, partly recognizable as my own and partly other (I've never
been quite able to put my finger on it), is speaking a language more musical
than linguistic (although that aspect is there too); no matter what language
I read in, every text has its own unique "accent".

Hear hear!  Many people have an acquired aversion to talking about soul and
spirit because organized religions hijacked the words and have been abusing
them for centuries.  And religion's replacements, science and money, don't
want anything to do with such notions because discussion along spiritual
lines points up the poverty of science and money with regard to the soul.

Much more.  Silence is the source of sound.  Sound arises from silence.  It
is the mysterious voice of silence which first calls us to speak.

so compelling when you know, kind of, what they are saying that

what does happen if you've never heard the language spoken is what

Shaunanne posted looking for a sourcebook of 20th century poetics.
 
There should be such a book, or attempt at one, but I don't think there is.
I'd be interested to hear from folks on the list re what should be in such a
book. Or even what it might begin with-- Dickinson letters? Rimbaud letters?
(not 20th c. but...) Pounds "A Retrospect"?
 
The Donald Allen & Warren Tallman book _The Poetics of the New American
Poetry_ (which is not available though Grove reannounced it few years ago
they never put it back out)
is a good collection though of course not up to date. Published in 1973 it
includes only 3 women-- Lenore Kandel, Levertov, & Stein. It begins with
Whitman (to Emerson), then Fenollosa, then Pound. Less historical breadth but
worth mentioning-- Waldman's _Disembodied Poetics_ , _The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
Book_, there's something called _Conversant Essays_ Wayne State put out a
couple years ago, ranges across the
current field pretty well, tho I don't  think
ethnopoetics or nuyoricans get a hearing, but
"confessionals" & new formalists (not a
very good term huh) alongside Sir Silliman

Thinking more about the business of deciding to teach a book one has
not read much, I remember that when I was a graduate student and a
bunch of topics were suggested, I would always take the one I knew
least about. It made for learning instead of whatever we do with our
favourite things. Simil;ar process when teaching a book: you have to
learn something, and who wants to keep on teaching what he knows?

Gary Geddes edited an anthology called _20th Century Poetry & Poetics_
which was published by Oxford University Press (Canadian Division) in
1973.  It has a large selection of essays on poetics by poets as diverse
as Auden, Pound, Stevens, Williams, Yeats, Creeley, Al Purdy, Robert Graves,
Olson, Syvia Plath and Gary Snyder.
 
Hope that helps.

Subject:      drive/soul
 
"soul" equals a word, that in my experience, often with a false glee, patches
over the decenteredness that centers all "passionate" activity (which I, or
Freud, or whoever before him called "drive," or Lacan who configures it as a
metonymically skating-figure eight, incited by and "circling" a vacuum, an
impossible/Real space between which there is a demand for a home, or placement,
... a resting)
 
e.g. "the soul of the nation"
gives a truncate to the very impossiblity of there being a uniform, embodied
nation people in the first place, the "passion" of patriotism is a "soul"-like
covering-over of the dis-ease of there never being possible an addressible
"people" as such (i've stolen this argument from claude lafort,
 _Democracy & Political Theory_)
 
e.g. "the soul of the lover/beloved"
 
But, this, I think needs no explaining..., the experience of the veiled
bullshit involved here is at-hand daily, and romantic comedies are a sure-
fire way to fill in this hole
 
(with the largest laugh of all, being able to --in the last and climatically--
stuff it in her)
 
(isn't it possible that the populace's supposed beloved, Hugh Grant, solicited
& fucked the whore less because of what she offered than to--in a truly
heroic, perhaps revolutionary way--displace his name from "he, King of Romance"
to "he, exposer of the traumatic, comedic root of Romance veiled by romancing"
and in so doing, risk sacrificing the celebrity right/rite of possesing and
gaining interest (money, otherwise) from his name/signature in the body
politic?  Although perhaps "cynical" love-wise, I should think this reading
nonetheless offers the utmost pleasure)
 
e.g., and finally, "the soul which inspires writing"
 
leave it to say, it takes no genius to figure out that everyone is always
talking far too loudly and writing non-stop, only some like to package, and
pass this on as "genuis" whereas others just keep mouthing on, in their own way
 
(cf. any of the talk shows which best get your gun, or to be less oral-biased,
the massive amount of "first-novels" from which I can make money editing)
 
 
and by the by, isn't e-space the ideal vent for all these vast verbal highways,
as a very convienent by-way from the world in its so sublime splitting?
 
yet what happens in this particular split, and perhaps all of them, is
something uniquely political,
and as such, e-space is the true seat of the "new" politics,
one that may both sit on its ass, or
get quite a many asses moving
 
with love,
abby c

I have no children, but a friend of mine used to play a metaphor game with
his son, who is slightly autistic.  He explained the concept of
comparison, and how many ordinary designations have metaphorical roots
(e.g., hands of a clock -- cf., of course, Nietzsche).  The boy would make
up all sorts of wonderful and 'ridiculous' metaphors for objects, people,
faces, events.
 
One day he looked at some stone steps that were covered in glittering
moonlit ice (they lived in Alaska and there had apparently been a thaw
followed by a freeze), pointed, and said "flight of stairs."  My friend
had NO idea if he had heard this expression before, but he's now convinced
himself that "Flight of stairs" originated in such a moment.
 
He later noted that his son's ability to create novel metaphor began to
disappear the day he entered school.
 
Cheers,
David

Likewise, I'm sure. Or, I'm not sure who it'll "screw" up. Do you feel
screwed up by exclaiming you're a poet?
 
I think I see the problem. You think that identity (as a grown-up) is a one
to one relation, and that it's conferred from outside, by praise. If someone
says "I like that poem" to a child (what's with the word "kid" anyway?) that
mark of respect will turn them into a poet. And they'll be stuck like the
rest of us. I suspect identity is a little more flexible. A child who can
think of herself as a giant clam or as some snow, "a stretched cat on a wide
branch," may think of herself for a few seconds as a poet, or as a violinist
writing poetry, or as tough, or shy, or as not worth listening to.
 
Maybe that isn't the problem. Maybe you're W.C. Fields. That's fine. But I
think you're recapitulating what Charles Alexander posted about--the need to
exclude certain kinds of poetic production from the domain of poetry. Which,
as he rightly suggested, is the wrong thing to do. If, instead, you want to
talk about quality, I'll read all your posts.

Subject:      Correction RE: where it comes from
 
        Oops--
        Some days ago I posted a diagram purporting to illustrate a thing
that can and does go wrong in the relating of where "it" comes from,
but I attributed the schema, via wild guess, to the wrong guy.  Not
Macherey's style to posit a structure so undialectical; it really comes
from Jurij Lotman as construed (and no doubt skewed) by me.
        It came to me that night in bed beside my fishing and camping
catalogs, my _Roadside Geology of New York_, and my Proust and H James with
their looping, soporific (in the good sense) sentences; but, because I've been
singlehandedly looking after one 4-yr-old nephew (who may or may not be
properly labeled a poet but certainly makes a crack amateur ethicist), I
haven't found time to post this correction until now.
        As I say, it was meant to schematize something that happens, not to
explain the whole writing situation.  Ron Silliman zeroes in on an important
problem with it--that it looks cooked-up as job security for professional
explainers--but, fortunately or not, that's not a refutation.
        I'd love to see it redesigned according to Tony Green's specs,
but wouldn't it take an Escher or a Magritte to draw that out?  Ceci n'est
pas un conceptual schema?  One can only hope. . . .

That's it exactly. Identity is what other people give you. It is what
you carry in your wallet. It is on your driver's licence, etc.
 
Self is something else entirely. First you have self. Then someone
says "You're my kid." That's identity. Read Stein on the subject.

A friend and I have been discussing this topic of child poets as well.
We came up with the conclusion that the child has no concept of being a
poet or an "artist", that is something we label them with and place on
their heads.  I think the pure fact that they are unaware of themselves
as "being" anything but a child expresses the purity of their actions.  I
agree with George that the "self" is a learned state of being, but I
don't think we can discard the creative efforts of children as merely
pretty pictures and charming rhymes.
         There is a sophistication in the lack of trained technical
expression.  The child may begin without direction but experimenting
within a medium eventually leads to a theory and a goal.  Children develop
their own patterns and aesthetic values which is why they have favorite
stories and teddy bears, etc .  Have you ever watched kids finger
painting?  They do have an idea of what they are trying to produce, but
they haven't learned the skill to translate the visions within their heads
to the paper in a form that can be interpreted by others.
        Poetry may be slightly different as children are bombarded by
language while still in the womb, while visual concepts develop later,
sound is always present.  Who's to say that that alone is not the
beginning of a poetic license

I think George wasn't objecting so much to the praising of children (in fact
he gave some in the first line), but rather, under the guise of praise, to
impose a label that the kid is then supposed to adopt as an identity and
live up to.  This can and does lead to neurosis, even in us adults.  I know
I don't want to "be a poet", I just want to write.  But I didn't aways feel
this way, and I used to be quite a nervous child until I decided it was OK
just to want to be, without predicating that being on something else.  Not
that I've succeeded in that task, mind you...

I'm back from the road with my two-bits.
I agree with George: children aare children. The attraction to
childhood as an artistic state bewilders me. It seems, among other
reasons, that it's the lack of control and discipline we, as adults,
admire and want to defend. Picasso sd something to the effect
that it took him a lifetime to learn how to paint like a child.
Or, unlearn, I guess. The process contradicts its destination.
It is still painting _like_ a child, out of a definition of "children's
painting". I find this issue alive in aleatoric comp., as well
as in Pablo's pictures. My drawings and storys, as a pre-tad,
didn't have this struggle. I guess my point is that trying
to develop a means to a child's perceptions is more the issue
than children's perceptions.

I'm not sure if this is what started this subject, or if it has
already been a part of it, but what does it mean to teach a book?
As an undergrad, oh so many months back, a book arrived in class,
occurred, became books, and we spent the rest of the semester, as
a group of individuals, trying to become a class with a book.
The book that arrived was not the one that left, usually. Sometimes
two or three or more left. Profs who played show and tell offered.
Those who engaged in the above process taught. They recognized it
as agonistic.

It's interesting this message arrives as I'm flipping

soon with my decision abt what books to assign for a
workshop I'll be teaching.
 
But isn't it a matter of how the book is used? I mean is
it possible, really, to approach teaching a book with
the understanding that it will be a different book for each
person? It may be hopeless. Yet a book can offer a basis, a context from
which to proceed. Cage left college after a
few years because he didn't understand why everyone
should read the same book. Certainly that was the
right decision for him. Maybe I'll assign Silence,
but whether to make them pay $16.95 for it. . .

Another interesting book on modern poetics (or at least poetic form,
the concrete manifestation of poetics) is Donald Wesling's *The New
Poetries*. Interestingly, he treats the whole run since 1798 (*Lyrical
Ballads*) as of a piece, rather than proposing differences organized
around "centuries".

Yes for poets, writers, or artists, disregarding age. We had to fill out a

with number of artists participating in our projects. One of our
exhibitions this year is a children's book art exhibition, and one staff

think that is NOT a good idea.

I like the emphasis that Ed gives  -  you don't teach a book you teach yourself
 
Arguably the processes of engagement with producing of a book are
them-selves forms of teaching the book though?
 
So, I'd ask the question again  -  which books that have YET to be written
would you teach?
 
I was hoping that responses might reveal hopes and ambitions for both
poetry and the book and therefore inevitably some optimism for
'yourselve[s]' and some marker space-cadet projects to fuel discussion -
maybe action.

Subject:      20th century poetics and child poetry
 
Just to connect some themes:
 
Does anyone else feel there's an interesting use of child-like language,
also beginner's guide to grammar type language, in modern poets like
Robert Grenier (in Sentences) or Lyn Hejinian (in My Life) or Carla
Harryman (especially in In The Mode Of), or Leslie Scalapino's early
work with its feel of lullaby and nonsense poetry quote unquote, or
Bruce Andrews' Wobbling, or Bernadette Mayer's Studying Hunger;
can this be just put down to the spirit of play, or camp? It seems
to me to be a vital distinction between some Language Writing and,
on the one hand, fifties and sixties Concrete Poetry, on the other
hand, the always urbane Ashbery? That there is a kind of defiant,
politicised, fascinating use of child-like language, that only a
forceful radical group could do, to make potentially hostile readers
frightened of it, so that it doesn't just get dismissed as childish?
Don't children also get dismissed as childish when they want to
include something normally excluded? Isn't Carla Harryman's work
in particular interested in using Language Writing "idiom" ( or
labelling or identification of her as a Language Writer) to open
up this very area of children not having the power to make people
frightened, as the Language Writers could? Isn't Harryman locating
childlikeness and play as not merely jouissance and pleasure, but
in fact a mode of intuitive purer vulnerabe being unjustly
brutalised? So that Language Writing becomes figured as not a
departure from, reaction to, but a return to, a reclaiming from?
 
Just some questions...

Maybe not REQUIRED, but I think students should be encouraged to write in
any poetry class. Trying to write the stuff may make poetry more alive
for them. It'll make them more interested and maybe more interestING too.
Also, you never know, there might be a beaten-down discouraged kid in the
class for whom a nudge to write poetry would open a world. (When I say
"kid" I don't mean "child" in relation to the other argument going
around.) (Or do I?)

George, Ryan, I'm sorry if anybody hurt you by praising you.
 
For an Apted-like review of the lives of the children Kenneth Koch praised
like crazy in _Wishes, Lies & Dreams_, see Jeff Morley's article in Teachers
& Writers Magazine (collected in _Educating the Imagination, Vol. 1_, ed. by
Christopher Edgar & Ron Padgett--available from Teachers & Writers
Collaborative, 5 Union Square West, NY NY 10003-3306, or, (212)
691-6590--many other books edited by Padgett are available). And, George,
you'll be happy to know that he feels that the praise Koch gave him was
bewildering, and that he gave up writing poems soon after. And _I'll_ be
happy to tell you that Morley grew up to be an editor at the Washington Post,
and a reporter and essayist whose work has been in the Village Voice, The
Nation.
 
Here, by the way, is his poem:
 
THE DAWN OF ME
 
I was born nowhere
And I live in a tree
I never leave my tree
It is very crowded
I am stacked up right against a bird
But I won't leave my tree
Everything is dark
No light!
I hear the bird sing
I wish I could sing
My eyes, they open
And all around my house
The Sea
Slowly I get down in the water
The cool blue water
Oh and the space
I laugh swim and cry for joy
This is my home
  For Ever

Some children are good poets and some are not. But I include the good & the bad in
the anthology I make up at the end of each workshop (this is every year, in an
urban public school where many of the students are classified as "at risk").
 
I have noticed that grownup anthologies do not exclude the bad either (& some
of the bad poets were never "at risk").

i don't know about "should," but i often ask, at the beginning of a class, that
students write quickly, for example, a "frank o'hara" poem. they usually like
that. o'hara's perfect, of course, because he did compose off-the-cuff, but i've
tried it w/ others as well, and often, for undergrads, i ask them to keep a
reading journal in which they are required, sometimes, to imitate the author
being studied.  i was surprised at, for example, how well this worked with lyn
hejinian's my life.  students who thought the work cryptic suddenly fell in love
with it and with themselves writing and remembering.

i agree w/ charles and with others who think it's okay for kids to be considered
paraticipants in creative activity, whether you want to label them as "poets" or
not --i think that latter consideration is contextual --there are times when
it's important, as in charles's example, to be advocates for children as
artists, and then it's also at other times important to avoid labels that create
anxiety about performance and adult expectations of kids.  charles, your post
reminds me of something i heard on the radio, about a nine-year-old girl who had
invented a board game, or something like that, that threatened a major
corporation because (i may be getting the details wrong) she used one of their
advertizing slogans.  or maybe it was the other way around, they cribbed for one
of their slogans a phrase that came from a board game she'd invented and
marketed.  anyway, the fascinating and salient thing about their argument, which
became a lawsuit, was that the corporation argued that because of her age she
was too young to have a right to claim intellectual property.  or whatever--her
age became the disqualifying criterion. this seems to me to be a clear example
of discrimination against creative children as children -- a form of
discrimination i believe most people on this list find objectionable --not to
hegemonize or colonize the nature of the list's participants --i guess i mean i
hope most people on the list would recognize this as blatant discrimination.

This is wonderful.  I'm definitely going to leave a book unread in the
fall.  I do usually leave what I'm going to say unthought until I'm right
there.  This surprises my students and leaves room for lots of confusion
and enthusiasm from every quarter.

i acquired this aversion after abandoning the family religion, realizing
these words didnt mean, signify, anything to me.  it's one of the reasons
i hate translating "animus" in latin class.  i still cannot
find anything in these words that does not bring back the ol' immaterialism,
irrationalism...  what i find is the poverty of the soul with regard to
science.
 
 so i'd like to know, then, what did soul and spirit
mean before they were "hijacked" and "abused"?  was there a before, or
merely our projection in order to gain ancient authority?
 
maybe I'M reading "soul" too religiously--but i'm afraid to use it otherwise,
expand it, to apply it to something mysterious that was once concrete (or
definable, at least, if not material) b/c this is the history of the word
god.  --brian

Yes, I've seen this happen a few times already--even after only 3 years
of teaching.  How can you learn that poetry is in your body and therefore
understand it in your body without giving it a hand/foot/head/throat...

Brathwaites _Middle Passage_ was made available years ago on a series of

August, but I'll let you know.  Maybe I've got at least one here in L.A.

Hmmmm....I. Lightman's "personal" message to "George" regarding a "list lurker'

if so many of the messages posted here weren't aimed at particular people.And
as for Mina Loy resembling Niedecker only in that both are female. . . have
 you read "Love Songs"?  Have you read Niedecker for that matter?  "Smallness"
 plays a part in both.  --Judy Schwartz (officially no longer a "list lurker")

In response to Brian's message of July 14:  I'm not sure of the exact etymology
 of the word "soul," and I'm too lazy to go out in this 97 degree heat to find
 out, but the word has certainly "branched out," so to speak.  What about music
 having "soul"?  Rhythm, depth from within, and so on. . .

For what it's worth, I first heard about a lot of the writing I'm now
reading (such as Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman, P. Inman)
(I was already reading Cage and Mac Low)  from
stumbling across Marjorie Perloff's "Radical Artifice: Writing Poetry
in the Age of Media" about a year ago. It was a good intro, and I've
been recommending it to people ever since. I *think* it's still in
print, but I'm not sure.

Getting ready to have been frightened? For those who want to follow up

_I Am A Child_ (#1, 1994) for its bearing specifically on Bruce Andrews's
