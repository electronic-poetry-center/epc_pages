Subject:      renga, re
 
     Aside from a desire to follow tradition, there is no
reason not to invent a new (cyber?) form of renga here.
I have done some work on what I call 0"bluestankas"
(modern or post-such urban and gritty) and in some ways
the spirit travels well.
 
     Over the weekend I chanced (serendipitously?) across
the best description of renga I've seen.  It comes from a
more popular and less formal source, but I  think it
captures the spirit or soul of renga:
 
"_Renga is essentially perpetual-motion verse capping.
To the fourteen syllables that cap a _tanka one adds
another verse of seventeen, in effect  starting another
_tanka.  Only this new verse  continues the thought of
the fourteen-syllable verse  and (more important) departs
from the meaning  of the original seventeen-syllable
verse, shifting the seasonal identification,  the
speaker, the mood, or some other significant element.
When you read _renga, you not only find meaning being
added and deepened, you see it  also being subtracted,
slipping into oblivion, as the old links slough off and
away.  You become attentive and wary as every link
shines and shifts under your eyes.  Buddhist critics
likened the composing of _renga to a correct
understanding of the impermanence of the world."
(from _All-Japan: the catalog of everything Japanese).

OK, I'm back after a half-week hiatus, and will continue to input on the
question of belief.  In a related story, Jonathan Brannen wonders why
there is resistence on the part of some to calling poetry an art, and then
muses about the respective roles of talent & technique.  But the obvious
answer doesn't seem to suggest itself, so I'll spell it out: some of us
don't like to use the term "art"  because for us more is lost than gained.
In particular what is lost for me is the avoidance of mystification,
evidenced aplenty by Brannen's well-meant appeal to the undefined (and by
implication undefinable).

While it's true that older folk forms have become increasingly calcified, I
think this is more part of an ongoing historic process than a result of
"the 20th Century." Once people are writing in a form that they learn by
rote rather than through an active community practice, you've got problems.
Hence, blues, or Child ballads, or New Orleans-style jazz, are, for the
most part, now rule-based artforms, rather than a tradition in which people
actively develop a style. & the rhythms used often seem as if the performer
learned them by rote, rather than felt them.
 
This is not true of some newer folk forms (by which I mean forms that have
an active life within some part of the culture), like some of rap or rock,
or even a little of what remains of jazz. Where there are real people for
whom the music is part of daily life, it is possible to have some of that
rhythmic looseness, even in the context of  "military organisation and
industrialisation." It's difficult for a music to be central to some
subculture (it seems impossible for any one music to be truly central to
the whole culture any more) and still escape becoming commercialized and
losing it's "folky looseness.
 
Capital must expand, and one of the ways it does this is to absorb other
cultural forms. So we end up with the travesty of a "folk" music that now
means a singer performing her own songs with few (if any) other
accompanists, rather than performing a song that no one knows the author of
or the debacle of  a "world" music that has all too often come to mean
"electric guitars from many lands." But that's probably a discussion for a
different group.
 
Getting away, then, from the issue of rhythm, to the more general issue of
traditional forms, (& back to poetics), much the same argument could
(obviously) be made for much New Formalist poetry. It's simply a different
thing for someone to write a canzone, a sestina, or a sonnet sequence
several hundred years after it was a functional poetic form within the
culture. It's no longer part of a living culture, it's a marketing
strategy.
 
There are different, but related problems when you are dealing with a
"tradition" that values formal innovation (also as marketing strategy)
regardless of content over continuing (or revived) formal structures used
to convey personal content.
 
Think how different "our" literary culture would be if many writers took on
the formal rhythms of Lyn Hejinian's "My Life," the five-line stanzas of
Barrett Watten's "Progress," or other structures & forms from language
works of the 1980s, just as many people write sonnet sequences or workshop
poems.
 
Could these idiosyncratic forms become idioms in any functional way? What
would it take for this to happen? Would it be a good thing?

Comments: To: wr-eye-tings@sfu.ca
 
Last week (as I posted earlier to <wr-eye-tings>, but not to <poetics>), I
heard a great performance by Dutch sound-poet Jaap Blonk. He did a lot of
his own pieces, several improvisations and a few works by others, including
two movements of Kurt Schwitters' Ur Sonata. Since then I've spent some
time listening to 4 recordings of the Ur Sonata: by Schwitters, Blonk,
Eberhard Blum & Christopher Butterfield.
 
As with any performance, there are differences between the interpretations,
but the Ur Sonata is pretty much a sonata in the classical sense. The use
of contrasting themes, how they develope and contrast, the dynamics and
tempi of the movements, etc. follow the structure of any classical sonata,
it's just performed using odd phonetic sounds instead of a western
classical instrument.
 
Given that the Ur Sonata so closely follows one of the strictest forms of
western classical music, what, if anything, makes it an avant garde work?

also, i went to see the last poets about a week ago at First Ave., the club made
famous by Prince's movie Purple Rain in the 80s.  the last poets were terrific,
their stuff still holds up 25 yrs later, and their new stuff, tho more look
within-ish than their Black Arts Movement era pieces, is powerful too.  it was a
mixed crowd, lots of young Black men who were very moved and serious, pleased to
have their situation acknowledged in straight-ahead verse, breaking out in
spntaneous applause during "stop the madness."  they were, incredibly, a warm up
act for a reggae group, so there was an incongruous line of white dreadhead guys
and chicks in the front row, swaying sultrily throughout the last poets' first
coupla numbers until they got the idea that this wasn't quite the idea.  lots of
older folks too, from my era (60s and 70s) of varying ethnic affiliations.  a
great show.  i liked that the poets weren't glamorous, like most club acts.
they were just a trio of middle-aged hefty guys with great sonorous voices and
good verse.--md

Cage discussed the Ur Sonata at least once that I remember--
he used it as an example of the danger of someone with no musical training
undertaking composition. That there is a tendency for one to become enamored
of "simple" musical tricks. He didn't find it interesting, whether it's avant
garde or not. He mentioned this in relation to a lot of work being done with
synthesizers & such-- that even though many "new" sounds cld be produced with
them a great number of the people working with them were thinking in "old"
ways.
 
There's another since in which the Schwitters piece cld be considered garde
at least if not avant. A couple of muggers approached Schwitters in Berlin
demanding money-- he began performing a portion of the URSONATE at the top of
his lungs, this seriously freaked them,  & they ran, w/out the money.

So, David, you don't like the term "art" because avoidance of mystification

I've thought about this a lot (from my usual non-degreed, layman's
position). One problem shows up in how you posed the issue: the new
forms get viewed as the "turf" of one writer or another (in your
examples, Hejinian or Watten), and to use them is viewed as copping
another's style. I've kicked around the idea of using Cage's mesostic
form, but the method is so strongly connected to his work that it
would be hard to avoid looking like a slavish imitator in doing it.
This isn't a problem in doing, for example, sonnets and sestinas,
since the identity of the originators has (as far as i know) been
lost.
 
Of course, there is the interesting stuff that happens when someone
tries to use an existing form, gets it wrong, and creates something
new. (I've been accused of getting my musical ideas by a consistent
pattern of misunderstandings; what the hell, it works.)
 
I get some flack from fellow poets (or, well, fellow
people-who-write-things-that-they-read-at-open-mikes)
for openly admitting that what I do is directly influenced by this or
that other writer (Cage, Mac Low, Karl Shapiro, etc). Most of them
seem to think that they are being totally original in writing their
narrative vernacular three-minute-long free verse. *sigh*

Hi, list. <She waves hello, takes a deep breath, and jumps in>
 
Joseph Zitt raises a good point. Are such allegations raised more often
against people who work with, for lack of a better word, "experimental"
poetries? When do Cage's mesostics or the Hejinian page from _My Life_
become formal "public domain" like the sestina?

               I've had conversations with Bruce Andrews during which he's
asserted 'free improv' to be a 'folk' form  -  certainly some of its more
baleful mannerisms nowadays (although there remain outstanding
practitioners) are little different in their stilted 'mimesis' than the
proverbial finger in the ear of the 'do you ken John Peel' 'folk'
performer.
 
               But at what point does tradition become perceptible as such?
It's a very slippery and therefore imperative question. Many live in
cultures and respond to communitites that tend (unwisely?) to foreground
'origination'. Many live in cultures and respond to communities that tend
to value ways to take traditions into the future.
 
               Does the compliment of imitation / conscious influence
reveal the arrival of tradition? What values do different communitites
place on this process? Or is the prevailing emphasis remaindered on the
basis of discontinuous disposable 'new product' consumerism? Curious
paradoxes here.
 
               The current Renga fever is a case in point:
 
collaborative branching processes that discuss community and difference as
they emerge, through considerable sometimes perhaps tolerant investments of
creative 'belief', into 'public' space and shared time.
 
               A collective exploration of formal potential. Conscious
formation (intention) of community is present here  -  resonant with Spicer
and also SF Poets Theatre and Poets Conference in the UK?
 
Has composition by chance become a 'folk' art? Is Mail Art a 'folk' art. Is
Jazz 'folk'? Sparks across the seemingly 'parallel' tracks?
 
And lurking defintions of community and culture. As 'polis' entropes
towards diaspora and decentralisation. As orgies of fragmentation become
the norm.
 
whoa!
love and love

I think that it does happen, if not with the precise structures then with the
_concept_ of idiosyncratic forms, and certainly with vocabulary. For example,
what are the poetic effects of using abbreviations (such as "yr", "sd", "th"
etc.)? I think they may have originally given an anti-"poetic" memo-like
quality to the writing (are they derived from telegrams?), but when I read them
in contemporary work, they appear to me as an idiom, almost a clichi. They say
"I wanna be Olson/Creeley". Perhaps we'll see internet abbreviations (IMHO,
BTW, RTFM etc) appearing in poetry soon. We probably already do.

I agree that writing a sonnet sequence now is a different act from writing one
several hundred years ago when such structures were de rigeur. I'm not sure,
however, that the sonnet ever ceased to be "living culture" or "a functional
poetic form". An art form doesn't have to be either part of mass culture or
avant garde in order to remain alive. People are still writing symphonies after
Cage and sestinas after Olson.
 
Even if one does choose a form that has fallen into disuse within one's culture
or was never part of it (such as a ghazal), there are a range of possibilities
other than "marketing strategy". Maybe one is, consciously or otherwise,
placing oneself within a tradition by writing a Petrarchan sonnet, a
Ginsbergian rant, or yet another Catullus poem. All that one is doing is
saying "this is where I'm coming from", in the same way that a hip-hop artist
might sample a James Brown riff. Or one could be putting forward a challenge to
that tradition, in the way that Michele Leggott's sonnet sequence _Blue Irises_
challenges the tradition of the male sonneteer. By using a form or genre,
one's poem can economically allude to everything written in that style, in the
way that Merwins _Elegy_ speaks of and to every elegy that has been written.
In either case, the form is saying something. Form signifies. Form is never
_less_ than an extension of content.
 
The final option is to use a "dead" form purely for its formal possibilities.
Of course, the reader is free to read homage or challenge into your poem, even
if you'd only thought "Ooh, I like that syllabic pattern!" when you chose a
14-th century Moroccan courtship song as your model.
 
Anyway, what's wrong with a marketing strategy? :-)
 
 
        Tom.

Well, I hope it's not (3). There was a flamewar on the wine mailing list a few
months back when someone used the word "feminine" to describe a wine (I think
it was a red Burgundy), and I think that no matter how hard we try the first
option, the gender connotations will cling on to the words, at least for the
next century or so. One cannot take a word apart like a car engine, replace an
old part that rattles and belches malodorous smoke, then put the whole thing
back together.
 
It's a pity, because I think that I've a pretty good idea what a "feminine"
wine tastes and smells like, and hence it would seem a useful term. But I find
the implications of calling a floral, delicate Beaujolais "feminine" and a
hefty, muscular Shiraz "masculine" somewhat offensive. It might be better to
define "feminine" as "having properties analogous to the social norms for women
in mid-20th Century Western culture" (and similar for "masculine"), but words
have a habit of wandering away from their "official" definitions. Get back
here!
 
Perhaps we could just use the terms "aggressive" vs "gentle", if that's what we
mean. We'd lose a lot of the subtle connotations of fem vs masc, but we're not
going to imply that all men are aggressive and all women gentle just by using
the words outside of a gender context. Maybe this is similar to the "soul"
debate: if a word is likely to cause misunderstanding or offense, then perhaps
it is wiser to avoid using that word with a given audience, and find a
substitute.
 
As an aside, I once sat (at my employers' request) a personality test called (I
think) the California Personality Inventory. After answering 400 True/False
questions, I was summed up as ten numbers, each of which placed me somewhere on
a scale between two binary opposites. One of these scales was labelled either
Masculine/Feminine or Task-oriented/People-oriented (the latter is now the
preferred labelling). Interestingly, I was considered unusually feminine.
 
 
        Tom.

Herb,
certainly it is "an ongoing historic process" but I wonder if this
"calcification is increased in 20th century capitalist society, particularly
due to this question of "active community practice." I mean it seems no
accident that various, often economically marginalized "subcultures" wld be
the lively areas-- places, perhaps, where community & therefore individual
expression is not so proscribed. Though that's what you seem to be saying,
sort of, in the rest of your post.
 
But this question of taking on the forms of _My Life_ or _Progress_, well (1)
I think it is happening, quite a bit. There are a lot of good little
magazines publishing tons of folks influenced by language (almost put the
word influenced in quotes, but why? Yeah I'm influenced & I'm a ding dadd
proud of it) -- some of them wld be _Proliferation_, _Impercipient_,
_Phoebe_, _Object_, _Avec_, _Black Bread_, _Antyneme_, _Prosodia_, _Open 24
Hours_, & even, of course, _Apex of the M_ (they just choose to articulate it
in a more oedipal manner) (2) This question of whether it wld be good, or is
good: aesthetically, yes, I think it's good, more people trying more kinds of
things, but I'm not sure I wld extend that to any form being "intrinsically"
good-- I can imagine these modes of writing becoming accepted, canonized,
codified, as much as any other kind of writing, which wouldn't be good. In
that situation one might make the radical gesture of writing a canzone.
Berrigan & then Mayer made the sonnet new. At the same time there is the
aspect of the aesthetic we're discussing articulated in, say, L.H.'s "The
Rejection of Closure" which might be, & has been,  fodder for an argument
that this aesthetic is inherently superior. I'm not entirely unconvinced by
that, it is the aesthetic, broadly speaking, I choose to work in. I suppose
it's a matter of art's ability to change our perceptions of the world. &
whether "open form" is good, or better. . . I don't think one can hierarchize
it, that's probably what we can/should/might learn from it. Does "open form"
spell "open mind," *really*?-- there are foolish folks as well as fabulous
people writing in these forms, maybe this is our open fate.

I've written some things using mesostics. One was a writing through _Fun with
Dick & Jane_, not exactly something one can easily imagine J.C. doing. I
don't think we should worry abt being thought derivative, every writer is.
But it will be new,
not as a result of a glorification of the new, but as a result of occupying a
different time. Stein sd something like that in one of the Lectures in
America. It wld be interesting to see a writer come along & choose the
mesostic form exclusively, really dedicate themselves to it, in the wake of
what John did, & to read their work in relation to him.
 
Re whether such allegations are raised more against "experimantal" writers
with regard to imitation. Maybe. But hey, go 'head, allegate. It's whether
the work's doing something or not that matters I think. I think these forms
become public domain as soon as they're made use of. Maybe we should write a
"renga" in sentence form on here called "Our Life."

I've been away for some weeks and am just picking up the ripples of past
conversations (rather like walking into a pub just before closing time).
 
FOLK/RHYTHM
Recognising the tendency of "professional" folk music to ossify these
days, we must recognise that it were'nt always so, and indeed on some
occasions it was the transmission process which caused ossification to
set in: c.1900 Cecil Sharp was having his transcriptions greeted with
academic incredulity: one musicologist actually said "no peasant could
think in compound time". Despite the mass of evidence to the contrary.
Being based Suffolk, Chris, you might know the Ship Inn at Blaxhall -
famous folksinging community right up to the sixties, totally ignoring
(and ignored by) the neighbouring haut musique of Britten etc. It's
described in G.Dunn: The Fellowship of Song (1980) (more of a
sociological survey).
 
The point is that the singers of Blaxhall & environs wouldn't just copy
songs they'd heard from other people: they felt they had to "move into
them" somehow, make them their own (am I out of line to relate this to the
"bardic" transmission process? Certainly it relates to my own abhorance of
"cover bands"...). This process was a lengthy one, could take months or
years until someone felt able to sing one they'd had from another, and
involved varying words (obviously), tune and rhythm. The rhythms and
inflections they used (as for all of us) came from around them. So, the
songs are organic and have a life of their own - until the folk orthodoxy
comes along to hammer these things into the "correct" versions...
 
NATIONAL POETRY WEEK
I'm sorry to see the US is going through this: I'd hoped the dismal flop
of our own National Poetry Day (shopwindow for the Glynn Maxwells and
Simon Armitages of this world) would be the end of it. I assume it's being
sponsored by the major publishers as a hype opportunity? Good luck to
anyone who organises anything outside that context: over here we advised
people to stay indoors and wait till it passed. There was even a National
Poetry Day Defence Committee (based in Cambridge) which put out some "How
to survive National Poetry Day" flyers.

Oh well, I'm afraid I've got nothing to say at the moment about folk music, the
feminine, or the soul, so there's nothing for it but to post some poetry :-)
 
Based upon the idea of phonetic translation, I tried feeding some foreign-
-language poetry through my word-processor's spelling checker, and seeing what
IT thought the correct spellings should be. The results were intriguing, if
only for finding out the bizzare vocabs that these programs have - how did
"Hyundai" get in there?!? Some of them also came out with an, ahem, anatomical
bent.
 
Most of the originals should be quite familiar. The first one is especially
easy to guess; with the last two, I've also "corrected" the titles to make it
easier.

cris,
 
obviously none of those avant-garde forms you mention have become
"folk" art. However, one of the classic 20C avant-garde techniques,
the Surrealists' exquisite corpse (as drawing or language-game) has
achieved some kind of status as generally available social
entertainment. (but obviously the game of telephone kids play is older
than the cadavre exquis).

David, Jonathan et alia,
 
The ancient Greeks did not distinguish as we do between art and technology
(techne). Is that what D Thomas was playing off of in the line that was
quoted. Now, would these same ancients have linked belief to making? I think
so, at least in principle.  So where does this leave us?

None at all: I was using "mystification" in a political sense, not in the
sense of uncertainty.  Therefore I think you misread my point, or perhaps
I didn't state it well.  I do not avoid the term "art" because it's "fluid
by nature,"  but rather because its associations in the case of poetry so
often lead to a variety of forms of copping out, throwing up of the hands
when it comes to describing how poetry operates in culture.  This is NOT a
rejection of fluidity.  So what if art is constantly changing?  So's
everything else, and I (obviously) don't avoid language entirely.  Rather,
I find myself pulled into a game of artistic fort/da whenever I encounter
the term "art" used actively ("here" art is, "here" art isn't).  And it's
tiring.  David don't play that game.
 
My point is similar to the one Charles Bernstein made some time ago (was
it at the Alabama symposium?) about preferring the term "writer" to
"poet": poet has a lot of baggage, or did then.  (I don't know if he still
holds to this; he seems to have gotten more poet-friendly in this regard
of late.)
 
I avoid the term "art" because it's not a construction I'm comfortable
with, not because art changes.  In fact, change is precisely the point: I
find the inherited vocabulary of "art" (that is, an aesthetic vocabulary)
inadequate for describing historical changes in poetry.  You can go ahead
and use the term -- I'm speaking only for myself.  For me, nothing is
gained by the term, and much is lost.
 
Cheers,
David

Could you repost the Thomas quote?  It seemed to have slipped by me.
 
You translate *techne* as technology?  Not as our technology certainly,
but...
 
Anyway, good point; as for me, it leaves me happily blurring the line
between art and, say, gardening.  Or using a jackhammer.  I'm reminded of
the continuity -- not division -- posited by Elaine Scarry in her book
*The Body in Pain* between "making-up" and "making-real." What others are
calling "art" straddles both these categories.  But so do most other
things. Scarry's is a way of talking that avoids the art/not art division
yet manages to make some profound connections about culture as a whole.
 
Speaking of which, has anybody read this?  I've often thought this was
utterly brilliant, the book to beat in recent philosophy and a possible
ground for a whole theory of culture, but I've not had the energy to write
much on it directly aside from a scattering here and there.  But I seem to
be the only one.
 
Cheers,
David

               Yes Ric, know something of the Blaxhall Ship's crew. Was
drinking Barley Mow at The Eel's Foot just last Saturday, a drunken stagger
of an environs away, where Jumbo Brightwell held court with his elder
brother Velvet during the '50s. His LP on Topic was titled 'Songs From The
Eel's Foot'  -  how about that for a response to 'where does it come
from?'.
 
               Know singer who travelled and sang regularly with
Brightwell. One night he heard a 'version' of Jack Barleycorn he'd never
heard the like of before  -  came, 'out of the blue'. Asked if he could
have the song and got words in post on back of old birthday card  -  says
you have to try to embody a new melody like trajectory of lightning. Only
version remotely like it  -  even from Brightwell  -  he ever heard. Given
some of the house ales in these parts who knows. Memory and event in the
compost of time.
 
               A different process from the bardic apprenticeship, which is
closer to drum knowledge as Arona N'Diaye described his learning to me once
-  given rhythm (aged 6 or so) and return to repeat that rhythm, hold it
'down' for 30-40 minutes without letting it 'go'. The requirement to do
that, sent away with same rhythm if not, before being given another rhythm.
A thorough and prolonged process of embodiment.
 
               Living traditions - social gifts - folk math - ephemera -
this list.

               Hi Pierre, guess I'd argue that Jazz has generated forms
that have become 'folk', much as Blues and Rock have also?
 
               In poetry I'd suggest 'Hallmark' (i know we've had that
discussion already) and Slams and that Renga form that evolved on the
Buffalo Poetics list sometime in the mid 1990s. How those, at first
tentative, variegated leaf forms became whole branches of prosodic
community generating rangey glossolalia among social migrations at early
twenty first century gatherings is one of the most notable examples of the
movement from written to oral I know. It suggests that writing affects
speech with more subtlety than formerly thought.

David,
 
I understand your position much better since you've restated it.  The
term "art" does carry a lot of baggage much of which one would prefer
not to be burdened with.  "Art" does elude easy definition which makes
it vulnerable to misrepresentation.  Certainly the freshman Republican
representatives have found it an easy target.  I don't mean to align
you with that group, but I do question the wisdom of surrendering the
use of the term "art" rather than reclaiming it.  I raise this
question for myself precisely because I get bored too easily to see
the appeal of defining what art is or isn't and what is or isn't art.
 
Best,
Jonathan

The Thomas quote was:  "The tricks are easy, it's the art that's difficult."
In context he was saying that it's easy to learn how to write a poem, it's

               OK I'll go right over the top, since I'm heading that way
with Jazz and Blues and Rock as twentieth century urban 'folk'.
 
               I'd like to throw in 'raves' (don't know if you have quite
the euro fever in the states) / 'football chants' and maybe sports chants
and expressions more generally such as the reinforced society of the
spectacle critique evidenced in the 'mexican wave' / 'graffitti' / 'rap' /
'calypso' / 'carnival' (anyone read the excellent 'Carnival in Romans' by
Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie  -  I know it's another source of carnival  - when
a peasants' revolt both succeeded and was then in turn violently repressed
during the course of one long carnival celebration with much Machiavellian
use of mask) / 'surfboarding' (etc) and their 'folk' 'arts' and specialist
languages cf Kathy Bigelow's movie 'Point Break' (or something close to
that title?) and Michael Davidson's article in Poetics Journal / 'the Aids
Quilt' / various campaigns 'greenham women', 'dongas' (you'll have your own
examples) / MUD and MOOs / tattoos and piercings (a paradox herein) /  & &

This could easily lead back into discussions of sampling and copyright. How
about common ownership and community versioning as oppositional forces

In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
And flew through windows, lightning green and fine morning
First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The rook to the knight here by King's Bishop Three
Something has changed in the nature of friendship
Renegade and flightless, board of common prayer aside
Retires a diplomat with "the Prussian blues" - misconstrual
but doesn't bother to misconstrue itself and then
drinkin' eel foot at the barley mow just last saturday i
     detected an anomalous rhythmicity nuncupating our otherwise
     tearfully drear decorum of the dead letter dance

I have found that the only people who avoid words like "art" on
egalitarian terms are the privileged, university profs and the like.
My brother-in-law wouldnt. And his job is putting together RVs. He
would never call that art, either.

His loss.  But I'm hardly privileged, or a prof (though I may be "the
like," I don't know).  For me the main difference between graduate school
and having finished is that my loans are due.  "Dominated fraction of the
dominant class," as Bourdieu says -- sure; but the privileges continue to
elude me.
 
Besides, it was not for "egalitarian" reasons that I avoid words like art
(or poetry).  It's for pragmatic ones: namely, I think I can learn more
without it than with.
 
Jeez, did I open a can 'o something.
 
Cheers,
David

Subject:      Re: folk rhythms & forms
 
There's been a lot added to this thread since I've had a chance to respond.
This is a digest of responses to lots of different folks.
 
Perhaps the "problem" with identifying the inventor of the sonnet isn't
just that the name is lost amidst (in the mists of) history. Instead it may
have to do with the fact that there was a community of artists working
together out of which the various troubador forms arose, similar to the
development of, say blues or bebop or photography.
 
In other words, ou can point to the group from which these things arose,
but you can't really single out one person as the originator. Both Rod
Smith & Cris Cheek seem to refer to this kind of development in their
several posts to this thread.
 
Many people who read this list have more knowledge of the specifics than I
do, but it seems to me that this may be true even in stylistic movements
like, say, Imagism or Projective Verse, which have a strongly identified
father-figure. Even here the style didn't leap fully formed out of the
forehead of any one writer. Rather, these simply (or complexly) grew out of
a dynamic process in which a group of writers reinforced various tendencies
in their work.
 
So, if there is a form that grows out of, say, "My Life" or "Progress," it
may not look exactly  like either of these works, but instead would be
related to several works by several writers working similar veins.

The "Take yer pardner..." renga
 
Proposed new email rules for it:
1.   Prior to posting her/his line, each contributor must send it
     privately to one other member on the listserv, who
     contributes the next line and then posts the two lines
     together to the listserv.
2.   No more than one contribution as initiator of a "couplet"
     per person every 24hrs.
 
Why doesn't somebody start on one of the rengas going now? In the
subject heading, maybe call it "take yer pardner renga # __."

I guess that "art" is a slippery term. I have heard, in interviews on
MTV, guityar wangers referring to themselves as "artists."

yes Burt close to my own sentiments re- art  as primarily a knowledge
in practice of the artist (including a knowledge of relation to
hearers, readers, or beholders)  only secondarily and latterly a category of  works to be
known by their conformities to protocols by which they should or
should not be admitted to a museum, anthology or canon  --  the purposes
of which prove to be to turn works into instructive examples for
future practice, running into the problem of the singularity of
occasions for works -- hence permanent quarrels between ancients and
moderns.    [ I've said this before, I guess.  boring????]

i was reading joseph beuys today, and i think he'd have no problem with
wangers who say their wangering is art. in an interview once, he said a
nurse is an artist. so is a banker. even a baker. so i don't think he'd
have any difficulty with wangers.
 
my art professor at york, someone who continues to remain an important
influence on me in my life in art, always emphasized that he was not an
artist and that he didn't make art. he was trained in the mystical
tradition of the kabbalah. his work is second to none. questions abt art
don't bother him in the least. we're in the process of getting a major
retrospective of his work together, which is likely to have both  national
and international contexts. more on that as it unfolds. whatever it is he
does or however he defines it, i know that he's found at least one key to
unlock the secret mind. he takes his work seriously. i have the utmost
respect for that. people often say: "man, yr just too damn serious!"

One of these things I think about when i don't have anything to think
about:
 
What is determining the lengths of our lines of the renga? No rules
have been stated, but there seems to be something in common about
them.
 
Personally, I've make them short enough that they don't wrap -- but
what is apparently keeping the lines as long as they are.
 
(Of course, I've probably messed things up by asking this, and
someone will no doubt post a one-character line...)

Comments: cc: q@umd5.umd.edu
 
Joe Zitt writes that "new forms get viewed as the "turf" of one writer or
another (in your [i.e. Herb Levy's] examples, Hejinian or Watten), and to use
them is viewed as copping another's style."
 
...in response to what Herb Levy calls _the formal rhythms of Lyn Hejinian's
"My Life,"_ wondering how different our literary community would be were such
forms to be passed around.
 
But, folks, isn't it obvious - and obviously conscious on Lyn's part - that the
structure of My Life owes much (i.e. its origin at least) to Ron Silliman's
Ketjak? These forms, in other words, certainly were passed around and imitated
and not at all thought of as anyone's "turf" for a significant time.
 
What is the relation between a writer's method and such formal choices, if in
fact they are not identical as seems supposed by JZ's "turf" metaphor?
 
Lyn H. and Ron S. are very different in their interests; the two poems My Life
and Ketjak very different explorations of time and perception as social and
personal fact.
 
What is the process by which response to poetic work is channeled into means of
identifying such work with an author?

Herb,
 
Point of information (only, since what you are saying is correct in its
thrust, I'd say):
 
the sonnet was not a troubadour form (though perhaps, a BIG perhaps, a
case can be made for some of the troubadours escaping the deadly effect
of the Albigensian Crusade and migrating to Sicily. It was there that
we find the first extant sonnets. Cf. Paul Oppenheimer's book.
 
Cordially,

Herb,
 
Of course, here and there, a single poet invents a specific form. For instance,
the poet Weatherly (formerly Elias Weatherly, formerly Tom Weatherly) invented
the "glory"--a tight lyric form in which the same vowel sound is repeated in
successive lines in successive syllable positions, etc. So, yes, he worked
the form out alone; yet he did not live in a vacuum.

this is kind of cool cuz wasn't sicily during this period a very hybrid kind of
place w/ arabic, its own italian, latin, etc, being written?  i did a little
shtick on islands at mla last yr and sd, mostly intuitively, that islands, far
from being "isolated," were crossroadss for cultural cross-polli(e)?nation.  so,
the sonnet, which is now the icon of mainstream poetic tradition, had its
origins in a swirling eclecticism of languages, traditions, forms and people--md

You can't get away from this "art" business.  To add, my ol papa
picked up my copy of GB's A Place to Die and when I caught him reading
it (he doesn't like reading "artsy" books) he asked me if using &
for and made something art or artistic. I haven't answered him yet.
When he asked me what Lolita was abt and I told him he didn't ask
anything about what made it art or artistic.  I haven't asked him why
yet.  Maybe nymphets are more obvious than ampersands.

Maria, if you want more evidence for islands being crossroads, there's a
big push among Pacific Islanders to reclaim themselves as an ocean of
islands that has had continued and heavy commerce among themselves for
thousands of years--rather than the Euro vision of them as isolated
blips in a vast sea.  Just been reading a similar commentary on Caribbean
island self-vision.  And certainly Hawaii is a magnetic center where east
and west meet.  I'm sure other Pacific islands are too.

Yet the K section of The Alphabet (specifically Ketjak2:Caravan of
Affect), literally "the next paragraph," is heavily indebted to Lyn's
"rewriting" of My Life and uses that quite consciously.
 
My sense is that it must take a good while for a form to break free of
the weight of that early identification. Look at how imprisoned the
early American prose poem was to the first few translations/imitations
of Max Jacob, as tho that were all one could do with prose in a poem.
 
My sense is that Blake, Coleridge and Pope could all have been taken as
inspiration for the prose poem and it would have looked like a very
different dog.

Inland Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection
Small Press Distributor To Remain Open Through Reorganization
 
At press time, Inland Book Company announced that it had filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on August
1. Under Chapter 11, the small and independent press distributor will
seek protection from creditors as it reorganizes its finances and
operations. "Inland has already taken steps to reorganize itself and
expects to continue operations without interruption," the company said
in announcing the filing.
>
        Inland s filing comes as no great surprise to those in the
publishing industry who had seen Inland, which specializes in
"alternative" literature, struggle through hard financial times. A year
ago, the troubled distributor was purchased by the Miller Group, a
Florida Company specializing in distribution businesses. In September,
Inland executives David Wilk and Steve Hargraves regained ownership of
Inland, claiming that the Miller Group reneged on its commitments. At
the time, Wilk said he had met with a number of Inland s closest
publisher friends, who had commited to supporting him in rebuilding the
business.

Burt,
 
Thanks for the clarification on the origin of sonnets.
 
 I'd always connected sonnets with an idea that comes from my vaguely
remembered reading of Pound (maybe Kenner, someone anyway) that the first
sonnet started when some troubador failed to be able to complete a canzone
form of several verses of 14 lines.
 
There are a lot of other things to respond to in this thread but I'm off to
the Olympic Peninsula imminently. Have a nice weekend y'all.

maria,
 
he's _tim whiten_, teaches at york in toronto, and is represented by the
olga korper gallery. the retro is tentatively set for mid 1996, altho i
haven't heard confirmation. i'm writing an essay ("the work as art") for
the catalogue. last time i heard either jack burnham or lucy lippard were
going to write the preface. i think getting hold of examples and
documentation of his work might be difficult. despite the contexts he's
worked out for himself, he remains somewhat _underground_, altho a major
performance/installation piece of his at art park in up-state NY was
included in lippards book _overlay_. the piece was called, if i can get
the sp right, "Morada," and it was conceived and performed during the
late 70s and early 80s. apologies fr going on abt this. what can i say?
rarely do you find such an expansive spirit, and rarely do you _connect_
 
thank you for your question, maria. i wanted to foreground his work
further in my earlier post, but didn't know how to frame it exactly
 
i'll post you a catalogue once everything is done and done
 
take good care,
carl

                PROPOSED CONGRESSIONAL CUTS OF $9 BILLION
        TO WELFARE/HEALTH/EDUCATION/WORKERS SAFETY REGULATIONS
                           MATCH MILITARY GIFT
 
                The symmetry is beautiful and awesome.
 
My last post ranted about the military industrial complex and how
we should really concentrate on that area if we need cuts in the federal
budget.  I responded to a comment from a colleague on this list that we
should step back and look at where the money is going instead of
insisting that the government punish a different set of students.
My point centered on the current 104th Congressional decision to
        *** give the Defense Department $9.7 BILLION MORE
                than the Pentagon even requested!    ***
 
        There was little debate in the House or Senate as far as we know.
No big fuss arose.  But the time has come for that stuff to hit the fan.
Almost THE IDENTICAL AMOUNT of money that the Rightists forced upon the
military is being taken away from children, the sick, the elderly,
students, and the working class in general.
 
All the dots were connected by thick lines following the money trail
straight to the doors of the enriching rich.  It was like deus ex machina.
 THE VAMPIRES CAUGHT IN THE ACT --RED-HANDED, as it were.
Now is the time to act.  Spread the news.  This is it.
Yours in solid.,

Maria,
 
My hunch is that courtly love and all came from the n african and what is now
middle eastern lyric tradition. i can't prove it, though a while back
Ammiel Alcaly (you may know him--recent book of his from Singing Horse
and another scholarly book from [i think] u of minnesota p) did some
graduate work on medieval hebrew and arabic lyrics, which, if i recall, suggested what i am saying. so anyway, sicily, sure--though why did SO MANY forms
arise with the troubadours and not with the sicilians; part of the answer to
this question has to do with the language of Old Provencal--but only part.
 
musing along . . .

Good stuff. Social imperatives are suggested here? Bringing urgencies to
process  -  urgencies which articulate obvious distinctions between
imitation and influence. Hit and miss periodicities of communication and
influence are extremely difficult to calibrate nevertheless. It is the
quality and the urgency of engagement with the currents within the tides of
such communications and influences which make a writer's work compelling. A
re-investment in processes of discovery. Any number of singers can sing the
same song but as we all know very few can do so in a way which compels us
to listen afresh.

and Gabrielle has cited Pacific Islands, in particualr Hawaii, and the
Caribbean in such respects. My own enthusiasm, as some will already know,
is for Madagascar (yes Gab, i owe you a letter on that).
 
One of the most celebratory aspects of living on this island (good to read
Ron referring to Britain as the islands recently  -  we relish being the
colonised outpost of the twentieth century US adventure) during these
pre-millenial tensile days is that of the colonial chickens coming home to

come together   -
 
'. . . O the mirror and the eye, you try to see yourself clearly
       Both hide significance from view, then allow you to see
       The hidden jewel, a veritable sapphire
       O nose and smell, when the two come together
 
       O smell and nose; when confusion is further confounded;
       A person become dumbfounded and loses track of everything.
       At the time for minstrelsy, when poets vie one with another.
       O hand and work when the two come together.
 
       O work and hand, a skilled performer is never completely overwhelmed;
       This is the secret of her greatness, so confident is she of her ability
       So on the day of her trila none would question her presence
       O the chicks and the hawk, when the two come together
 
       O the hawk and the chicks! when one sets its eyes on the other
       One soars high into air, even only a young bird;
       Snatching its prey from the air, even with the left hand.
       O the mattress and the pillow, when the two come together . . .'
 
(freely translated from Muyaka  -  19th century swahili poet)

Luckily, rengaphobia can be cured by behavior modification techniques and
there is no need to appeal to constructs such as renga envy.

Aldon,
 
First of all, I have to comment that it feels weird finally attaining
the status of "subject position" (multiple re. including: my recent
hyperglossia about "self" versus "subject position," and the subject
title of this post which is a reply to your post).  Anyway,
 
Weatherly (I'm having dinner with him and his wife tomorrow) hasn't published
any books since the first perfect bound book by Totem Corinth, "Mau Mau
American Cantos," followed by some chapbooks including "Thumbprint" (Telegraph
Books).  He is a manager at the Strand Bookstore in NYC; he is still writiing
poetry mostly.  He is more ecelectic than ever.  His poems these days are
to my mind brillian and original, extremely dense and subtle both, leaning
in the Zukofsky direction (on the sound-sense axis).
 
I think some publisher would be wise to do a book of his. No one is doing
the sort of thing he is, in terms of both language and theme.
 
If you like, I can ask him to send you some of his work (backchannel me)
or I could post a few of the poems, or whatever.  Anyway, I'll tell him
you asked.
 
Burt

                PROPOSED CONGRESSIONAL CUTS OF $9 BILLION
        TO WELFARE/HEALTH/EDUCATION/WORKERS SAFETY REGULATIONS
                           MATCH MILITARY GIFT
 
                The symmetry is beautiful and awesome.
 
My last post ranted about the military industrial complex and how
we should really concentrate on that area if we need cuts in the federal
budget.  I responded to a comment from a colleague on this list that we
should step back and look at where the money is going instead of
insisting that the government punish a different set of students.
My point centered on the current 104th Congressional decision to
        *** give the Defense Department $9.7 BILLION MORE
                than the Pentagon even requested!    ***
 
        There was little debate in the House or Senate as far as we know.
No big fuss arose.  But the time has come for that stuff to hit the fan.
Almost THE IDENTICAL AMOUNT of money that the Rightists forced upon the
military is being taken away from children, the sick, the elderly,
students, and the working class in general.
 
All the dots were connected by thick lines following the money trail
straight to the doors of the enriching rich.  It was like deus ex machina.
 THE VAMPIRES CAUGHT IN THE ACT --RED-HANDED, as it were.
Now is the time to act.  Spread the news.  This is it.

Gabrielle and Maria,
 
I believe in was the composer Terry Reily speaking of his composition C
who said that progress in the arts frequently resulted from members of
one culture imitate the style and methods of another culture without
understanding its context within the original culture.  Unencumbered
by its original cultural baggage, the relatively regimented forms
of making and doing within one culture are free to evolve in new
directions when adapted by another.

Subject:      Quirky Urgencies
 
On imitation and influence and on the "passing around" of forms...
 
...for one thing lots of formal thinking in new poetry, as I/we
experienced in the seventies, for example, was about procedures:
methods, ways of doing things. And these ways, or one's sense
of them, could be influential yet expressed in very different-
appearing formal constructions.
 
At the same time, it's important not to downplay the importance
and interest of imitation itself. It's fun an duseful to find
out whether you can do a thing that you see someone else doing,
and that may involve very blatant imitation. Anyway, imitation
doesn't always produce similarity (mimesis is an interesting
topic...). Beckett imitated Kafka as a way of getting free
from Joyce's influence, but his early work doesn't actually
arrive at much of a similarity to what it imitates.
 
Perhaps originality finds in imitation an interesting motor
to appear.
 
At the same time, I also remember a lot of not very interesting
work (to me, that is) which seemed to be trying to be "the
new sentence." But, of course that "theoretical" construction
had an utterly personal character, as Ron extended into poetry
his political concern with "the sentence" in a very different
sense and kept the continuity and contiguity in a rather
private irony; i.e. it was never discussed I do not think or
at least I do not remember (which means less and less...).
 
But it didn't get by me, Ron. In that sense, I mean, "the
new sentence" was inimitable. Or any other new sentence
would be original perforce, however mimetic.

     Rather than starting a flame war, it might be appropriate
to branch  off a  thread  from poetics in response to the
spontaneous interest that has developed in response to the
interactive development of the renga thread.
    This might also resolve two other issues that have
generated some controversy here: publicity vs. exclusivity
and posting of poetry vs. posting of criticism and theory.
I think it would be a mistake to restrict or cut off the
interest this thread has sparked, no matter how good or
bad the work is as _POETRY_ or _RENGA_.

Jonathan, to tell you the truth, today i was watching the american movie
channel & sure enough there was going to be an old mgm movie. i cut off
the sound & watched leo's lips carefully & you are right--in a way: it
looked like he was saying ***zea mays everta plus emptor*** .
i think it was my stepmother who fooled me into believing that he said
the other thing.

In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
And flew through windows, lightning green and fine morning
First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The caravan of windows to what they flee
These lace curtains, more gauze than bondage, more
Mollycoddled than aware, thin-spined and pebbling
but narrow in the waist or waspish Sunday years ago
Over coffee topped with whipped cream, the Times blowing
& opining, heavy humid air, cumulus amusing against the
bleached ribcage ripcorded into compassed wind

Yes, I fear Renga.
I fear art.
I fear one big happy poetics list.
I wake up at night in a cold sweat because according to all of you i have
no soul.
I fear generalizations and broad conclusions.
I fear people that jump down my throat and make accusations even when I
say please.
I really fear "quatations marks" and brackets ( GOd they're really,
really scary)
I fear that someone might inform me that I'm not actually writing poetry,
but a bukowski novel.
I fear witty comebacks and cynical remarks.
I fear Courtney Love.
I fear that someone might think I think COurtney love is an " artiste"
I fear peopel who correct typos and speling mistaeks
I fear that someone might replace the word fear with the word hate in
this posting.
I fear that I might actually be allowed to post my own opinion and not be
condemmed.
I fear the US.
I fear that someone might find out I have dual citizenship and that my
father is American.
I fear that the only reason that I'm proud to be Canadian is the fact
that it means i'm not American.
 And due to all this fear I now have a facial twitch and feel faint when I
hear literary analysis. But that's ok, i think it adds character so yes.
please continue.
Viva Renga!

As official chair person of the Canadian Council Against Renga (Car) I
charge Charles Alexander with unauthorized use of the Loon," loons in a lake
one can see through, diving between sunrises".  The Loon is considered a
part of Canadian culture and heritage.  The Loon was officially chosen to
appear on the Canadian dollar coin in 1987, as it reflected typically
Canadian mannerisms being some what annoying and mostly harmless shooting
it's mouth off for no apparent reason. The coin has since been
affectionately nicknamed the " Loonie" I warn you that the members of CAR
view the symobolic importance of the Loon to be at par with the American
Bald Eagle, therefore this is no laughing matter.  WE request that all
renga using Loons as a poetic image or metaphor please cease immediately.
 
 
                        Thanks for your understanding, we wouldn't want
to make this an international incident.

The loon is also the state bird of Minnesota, although I saw my first
several in Wisconsin last week. I apologize for offending Canada, which I
greatly respect.

Yes, that makes a lot of sense to me.  Works across time too, so that,
for instance revivals of particular folk traditions, like Irish, say, or
Hawaiian produce wonderful new possibilities and mixtures that were never
possible before.

Yes, exactly! But when the _imitator_ is from a culture that has colonised the
culture that produced the _imititated_ form, the imitator better watch out for
the PC police. Viz Gordon Walters' use of the Maori koru design, and his
wonderful explorations of its formal possibilities, without any necessary
reference to its cultural origins and context. But that's "appropriation"
(sorry guys, didn't see the copyright symbol) and hence not on. Are we allowed
to use (e.g.) the myths of other cultures in our writings, in whatever way we
want, or do we have to sit a test to prove our cultural sensitivity?
 
 
        Tom.

First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The caravan of windows to what they flee
These lace curtains, more gauze than bondage, more
Mollycoddled than aware, thin-spined and pebbling
but narrow in the waist or waspish Sunday years ago
Over coffee topped with whipped cream, the Times blowing
& opining, heavy humid air, cumulus amusing against the
bleached ribcage ripcorded into compassed wind
condemmed.

Dear George,
           I recall someone speaking lately of the 'rigor' required when
trucking across the 'slippery landscape of gender'. And one proposal which
followed was that we drop the words for gender they are so slippery, so hard
to grasp they fall from one's hands. My proposal, however, would be to
drench all the words we are interested in in whatever mucous membrane, goop,
bodily fluid we can lay hands on and like Ishmael said: SQUEEZE 'em good!
Are you with me?

Dear Gabrielle,
             Do you have in mind the material on the settlement of
Polynesia? The emerging picture of an Age of Discovery, with planned voy-
ages ranging over 1000s of miles of the Pacific? I've just got back from an
incredible week on Cheju, an island off the coast of South Korea, which was
the venue for an exhibition of art from Japan, Korea, the Philipines,
Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. The theme was 'From Island to Island'.
Billed as a Pre-Biennale, they plan a full-scale international event in
1998 with the same theme. I wasn't entirely clear but had the impression
they may limit the invitations to islands. Maria's posting suggests some of
the richness of the notion of island culture.

It's sensitivity to those double-edges which is perhaps most nourishable.

Tom, I appreciate your advocacy of the diversity made necessary by the

Yup. 'Found' poems lever this issue wide open.
 
There's another characteristic that's appropriate to this discussion  -
it's the nature of the impossibility of returning to a state before
learning, without the influence of that learning being somehow present. For
example when I first started writing ('75) people would say to me "so, how
long have you been doing cut ups?" The answer of course was that I never
had. But, at first glance my work could look as if it had been produced by
a cut up process. Well, the point is that I'd read Burroughs  -  in
particular samizdat collections such as 'White Subway' - but more
essentially I was exploring syntactic 'continuous discontinuities' as a
response to complexities of interactive human (for me at that time
urban-focussed) simultaneities as a response to a 'staring' for humane
consciousness in the post-Hiroshima, post-vietnam, post-colonial context of
a collapsing western world power. I was both thinking and writing in what
other's might consider disjunctions but which for me had 'internal logic'
in their making.
 
There is a bridge here to discussions about forms  -  influences and
imitations - with respect to 'lang-po' and folk cultures. There is also a
bridge to discussions on copyright and origination.
 
The renga fever which continues, gloriously unabated, displays familiar
paradigms in such respects.

I certainly didn't mean to imply that Walters didn't understand the cultural
context of the koru - perhaps I worded my post poorly. What I meant was that a
_viewer_ can appreciate the formal patterns in a Walters painting without
having any knowledge of maoritanga her- or himself. A naive viewer (such as
myself :-) ) can enjoy the visual rhythms and shifting figure/ground
relationships of these paintings while knowing next to nothing about what the
koru design means to Maori. It's in _this_ sense that I think the
misunderstanding (or more likely non-understanding) can be creative.
 
As Jonathon said,
 
  >Unencumbered

While "cultural baggage" has the wrong connotations in this context, I think
that it's fair to say that Walters' paintings have "evolve[d] in new
directions", with the koru (at least to some eyes) as abstract design rather
than signifier (what does the koru signify to the average Pakeha, other than
Air NZ?).
 
I agree that Walters has great understanding of and sensitivity to Maori
culture (as his titles show - good point). But he has still been attacked for
"appropriating" the koru, and desecrating it by taking it out of context. I
have a vague recollection that Ngahuia te Awekotuku was offended by a title
that (I think) translates to "prayer" in English.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean "with_out_ any necessary
reference"? And I'm intrigued by your use of the word "heresy". A heresy
implies an orthodoxy (and hence a police :-) ) - against which orthodoxy does
one trespass when exploring a form outside of its cultural context? And are you
using "heresy" in the pejorative sense? I'm quite partial to heresies, myself.
 
To bring this back to poetics, is it heresy to write a haiku (or indeed a
renga) without any knowledge of or reference to its place within Japanese
culture? Is it heretical to take phrases from (say) an American fashion
magazine and combine them into a found poem without any reference to their
original context? "Heresy, man!"
 
 
        Tom.

Yes, exactly! But when the _imitator_ is from a culture that has colonised
theculture that produced the _imititated_ form, the imitator better watchout
for the PC police. Viz Gordon Walters' use of the Maori koru design, and his
wonderful explorations of its formal possibilities, without any necessary
reference to its cultural origins and context. But that's "appropriation"
(sorry guys, didn't see the copyright symbol) and hence not on. Are we
allowed to use (e.g.) the myths of other cultures in our writings, in
whatever way we want, or do we have to sit a test to prove our cultural
sensitivity?
 
Tom, I don't understand 'formal possibilities, without any necessary
reference to its cultural origins and context.'? First this is not the same
as the Reily (sic) proposition, which refers to not 'understanding' the
context concerned. Walters certainly did understand the context,indeed
his understanding among Pakeha artists of the period was rivalled only
by his friend Theo Schoon. Second,  the notion that you can explore a form
with any necessary reference to cultural context is a modernist heresy. No
PC police required there. And third, if there is no necessary reference to
Maori origins and context why did Walters give the pAintings Maori names?

I pretty well agree with Wystan. I am usually suspicious of those
words one sees in reviews, such as "rigor" or "sinuous prose" or the
like. I am also repelled by awkwardnesses caused by she/he or that
really unattractive (s)he, etc.  I am not afraid of "slippery
landscapes," either, living in a rainy climate. I am not interested
much in rules and proscriptions. If you dont like to read Ishmael
Reed because he is adjudged misogynist in some circles (usually of
inferior writers), then dont read him. Ditto for Pound if you will
not read anti-semite social creditors. As it says in the Bible, "go
ye forth and write." I usually find that I enjoy reading writing a
lot more than confronting ideas that come thru uninspired prose.

I think the renga has finally drowned out just about everything else.
 
It's rather daunting having 30 or more renga messages in only one day.
 
I like the renga, but I like the else, too.

Hi, list. I was wondering if anybody would be willing to reflect back to
me their experiences with various translations of Baudelaire. I am not
interested in establishing whether one translation is considered "best"
or "definitive", but if anyone knows one or more translations, tell
me--did it come close, inasmuch as that's possible, or did it completely
miss the old bateau ivre?
 
Thanks--

Yeah, yeah. But everybody always says them together like they were joined
at the hip or something--Baudelairerimbaudverlaine, etc.--so I figured
they could at least be sitting in the same boat.

     The He Who Is Autonomous, Timorous, & Few
 
I am the milkshake without color
And without hands, come the butcher,
Come Moses the rocker!
And I am wild as a pauper,
 
For the abbreviation of my Sahara,
The jailer has the eyes of Southern France.
My desire has gone, fled the desperation
Over the black's salty tears.
 
Comes a vassal who pretends to be so large,
And in my heart quills and coins descend
The chairs of bloodspots retire
Come the tambourine who ducks the charge
 
Nor am I in false accord
In the divine symphony,
Grace of voracious Irony
Who has secured me and who has killed me?
 
Elle is in my voice, the crier!
It's all of my blood, the poison black!
I am the sinister mirror
Or am meagerly regarded!
 
I am the place and the Cocteau!
I am the souffle and the joy!
I am the members and the red,
And the victim and the ass!
 
I am of the heart of the vampire,
--One of the great abandoners
Of the eternal dire damnings,
And who never cries more than laughs!

...also known as the "three men in a boat" version of frog lit...BTW
re The Drunken Boat, check out Clayton Eshleman's version in his
_Conductors of the Pit_. It's one of the more impossible poems to
translate. Of that threesome, drop Verlaine & substitute Nerval --
much better poet, & some excellent translations of the great sonnets
by Robin Blaser (plus criticism of those by Duncan).

speaking of AR, i know louise varese's translation of some of the letters and
Illuminations is spozed to be good, but she translates "je est un autre" as "i
am someone else," or something like that (don't have the book in front of me),
which i think domesticates a really wild statement in an unfortunate way. what's
the opinion of relatively more native speakers (I know yr not "french", pj, but
yr knowledge thereof is certainly vast...)--md

don't know if it's vast, Maria, but thanks for lancing my day that
way. The Varese translations were excvellent, but are in need of
overwhaul. The famous sentence you quote is (& has beeen) much better
translated as "I is another."

Just to recommend a stunning book, translating and re-translating
the same single Baudelaire poem forty times, called Spleen, by
Nicholas Moore, a British poet; he wrote all the poems as an angry
response to a translation competition run by a British newspaper
in the sixties, and sent each one under a more and more ridiculous
psuedonym, until the judge, George Steiner, spotted the game, and
awarded a Special Mention prize; I'll bring in some of the translations
and put them on the list in the next few days. I think, myself, that
Baudelaire has suffered from being block-translated, ie the whole of
the Sulky Flowers (ho ho) book, by one translator commissioned by a
publisher; he would be best served by an anthology of translations by
many translators, I feel,

Since Pierre Joris is my dear friend & sometime collaborator, let me put in
a bid to open up the word "another" & bring it back to two words; thus:
"I is an other."  At least that's how we have it in zee big new anthology,
Pierre: page 44 of the recently acquired bound pages -- & a much better
entry into questions of "self" & "other."
 
Talk to you soon.

Burt,
 
"Close"--that's a good question. I'm reading Donald Revell's translation
of Apollinaire's _Alcools_ right now, and while it departs considerably,
at times, from the literal French, the *quality* of the language--sound
quality, use of syntax and connotation--works very well. I guess by
"close" I mean something like "expressing, as much as is possible, the
poetics/sensibility of the original."

You don't have to be tenured (or even University affiliated) to sign
this, nor from the Tri-State area. You don't (if you have followed this
case at all) even have to believe in/assert Abu-Jamal's innocence. His
trial and subsequent legal misadventures have been like the Worst of
the 60s redux when it comes to basic travesties.
 
Feel free to pass this on!

Forwarding this in hope that list members will be interested in lending
their support for Mumia Abu-Jamal, who remains on death row in
Philadelphia even though he just yesterday received a stay of
execution.  Abu-Jamal was among the founders of the Philly Black
Panthers in the 1960s.  Prosecutors have consistently used his
political writings from the 1960s and early 1970s to establish his
guilt in the killing of a local police officer.  If any of you doubt
the relevance of Abu-Jamal's case to the topics discussed on this list,
look no further than today's NYT, which explains that "The hearing,
like the trial, has been haunted by the unresolved political and
cultural conflicts of the 1960's and 1970's...."

                    AMAJ IS STILL GROWING WITH 200 SIGNERS:
 
                    NOW AIMING FOR HUNDREDS OF NEW NAMES !
 
 
       Any faculty out there with affiliations to academic
institutions, please lend your names to AMAJ, and sign on with support
for the "Declaration for Mumia Abu-Jamal."  Send your name and
addresses to the above contacts.  We are compiling names and money for
large ads in THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER.
 
       AMAJ held a highly successful press conference in Philadelphia
on Tuesday, July 25, 1995.  Almost all the press covered us - some
fairly, some not.  The PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER published a story on us
under the heading, "Academics, 144 Strong Seek New Trial".  We are not
only getting our position out there, we are getting a saner speech out
into the public arena, to counter the incendiary bloodlust of
Philadelphia Mayor Rendell and of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.
 
       Special respect goes out to the Philadelphia-based faculty who
led the way and addressed the press eloquently:  from the University of
Pennsylvania, Ann Farnsworth-Alvear (History), Farah Griffin (English),
E. Ann Matter (Religious Studies and Womens Studies), Antonio McDaniel
(Sociology), and Ines Salazar (English),  and from Temple University
were Rebecca Alpert (Women's Studies), and Daniel Tompkins (Classics),
and from Swarthmore College, Mark Wallace (Religious Studies).
 
       Here is the "Declaration" we have been presenting to the press,
and which we hope you can sign:
 
                       A DECLARATION FOR MUMIA ABU-JAMAL
 
       Across our many differences as scholars and citizens, we in
unity declare our concern that full and deliberate justice be extended
to Mr. Mumia Abu-Jamal.
 
       As faculty of the tri-state area of Pennsylvania/New Jersey/New
York, and increasingly throughout the nation and world, we - PROTEST
Governor Ridge's signing of Mr. Abu-Jamal's death warrant.
 
              - DEMAND Judge Sabo's removal from the case.
 
              - CALL for a stay of execution AND a new trial.
 
 
                    ========  END DECLARATION  ========
 
    Some prominent signers include Manning Marable, Henry Louis Gates,
Jr., Cornel West, Houston A. Baker, Jr., Nell Painter, Richard A. Falk,
Molefi Asante.  The main point, though, is that MANY of us are signing
this for Mumia and for what he stands.  Send your name now if you can.

Yes, that's just what I was thinking of.  And at a Pacific Writers Forum
last year, people agreed that there is still a tight web of relationship
wherever islanders are.  They send and bring things back and forth
among family members who have stayed and ones who have left.  I found
this to be true when I was living in Ireland too.  Something about
islands.

 Mania in the Stadia:
 The Origins and Goals of Promise Keepers**
 
   Promise Keepers is a rapidly growing Christian men's movement that last
year rallied about 300,000 men, filling six football stadia in colorful
displays of male "spiritual renewal." The group plans to double the number of
participants and stadium events in 1995. While projecting an image of
spirituality, leaders of Promise Keepers seem to be bent on gaining social
and political power. In the world of Promise Keepers, men are to submit to a
cell group that in turn is closely controlled by a national hierarchy. Most
important, women are to submit absolutely to their husbands or fathers.
   Promise Keepers may be the strongest, most organized effort to capitalize
on male backlash in the country today. Conceived by University of Colorado
football coach Bill McCartney in 1990 Promise Keepers says men should
"reclaim" authority from their wives - to whom they have supposedly ceded too
much.
    Bill McCartney's goal in 1990 was to fill a sports stadium with Christian
men to exhort them into his philosophy. The following year, he attracted
4,200 men to a basketball arena; 22,000 men came to Boulder's Folsom Stadium
in 1992,1 followed by 50,000 men in 1993. Promoted by powerful elements of
the Religious Right, Promise Keepers filled six stadia in 1994; the largest
event was in the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis, which drew 62,000 men. The
only women present were custodians and concession stand workers.2
   So far in 1995, Promise Keepers events in Detroit and Los Angeles have
drawn over 72,000 each.#  (Ed. Note--Denver recently exceeded expectations )
Don't Ask, Take
   The manifesto of the movement is Seven Promises of a Promise Keeper, a
book published for the group by James Dobson's organization, Focus on the
Family.4 Evangelist Tony Brown, in his contributing essay, explains how to
deal with women. "I can hear you saying, 'I want to be a spiritually pure
man. Where do I start?' The first thing you do," Brown explains, "is sit down
with your wife and say something like this: 'Honey I've made a terrible
mistake. I've given you my role. I gave up leading this family, and I forced
you to take my place. Now I must reclaim that role.' Don't misunderstand what
I'm saying here. I'm not suggesting that you ask for your role back, I'm
urging you to take it back." [Emphasis in the original].5 While insisting to
male readers that there is to be "no compromise" on authority, he suggests
that women readers submit for the "survival of our culture."
Total Submission
   While serving as an assistant football coach at the University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor, Bill McCartney encountered and was deeply influenced by the
Word of God (WOG) community. McCartney has said that WOG leader Jim Berlucci
is one of the two men who most influenced his life.6 WOG, a select and
insular group of about 1,600 adults, practiced "shepherding/discipleship,"
which required total submission to a person called the "head." Members were
required to submit their schedules in advance and account for every hour of
every day. Marriage partner, movie choices, jobs, and other decisions also
had to be approved by this leader.
   Members who questioned authority or women who questioned their extreme
submission to men, were subject to often traumatic "exorcisms." WOG members
were trained to see the world with suspicion and contempt - as an enemy. They
believed that they were specially chosen by God to fight the Antichrist.7
When McCartney was hired by the University of Colorado, WOG introduced him to
the WOG-linked "Vineyard" church, which has a parish in Boulder. Vineyard
churches emphasize "signs and wonders" and "prophecy." Vineyard leader John
Wimber calls their work "power evangelism" and describes his followers as
"self- conscious members of God's army, sent to do battle against the forces
of the kingdom of darkness. "One is either in God's Kingdom," Wimber insists,
"or Satan's."8
"The Purpose of War"
   McCartney's pastor at the Boulder Valley Vineyard, Rev. James Ryle, whom
McCartney says is the other major influence in his life,9 conducts a
".prophetic" ministry and participates in conferences with men who claim to
be prophets in the Ist-century sense of the term.IO Ryle believes Promise
Keepers, of which he is a board member,11 is the fulfillment of the
biblically prophesied end-time army described in the book of Joel - a
terrifying army from which there is no escape. "Never have 300,000 men come
together throughout human history, he declared, "except for the purpose of
war." He says he has a vision of Promise Keepers purging America of
secularism, which he con- siders "an abortion" of godliness.12
   Ryle spoke last year at a secret Colorado conclave to plan
anti-gay/lesbian electoral strategies. He said, "America is in the midst of a
cultural revolution, which has poised our nation precariously on the brink of
moral chaos, which is caused by what I am referring to as the crisis of
homosexuality."13
   While Promise Keepers is not currently a political force in its own right,
McCartney leads by example. He has repeatedly attacked reproductive rights,14
and he campaigned for the 1992 anti-gay Amendment 2 ballot initiative as a
member of the board of Colorado for Family Values, the sponsor of the
initiative.15
   His rally addresses have been uncompromising, "Take the nation for Jesus
Christ," he directed in 1992.16 The following year he said, "What you are
about to hear, is God's word to the men of this nation. We are going to war
as of tonight. We have divine power; that is our weapon. We will not
compromise. Wherever truth is at risk, in the schools or legislature, we are
going to contend for it. We will win "17
   No less militant is Promise Keepers co-founder Dave Wardell18 who told The
Denver Post, "We want our nation to return to God. We're drawing a line in
the sand here.... There has already been controversy about abortion and
homosexuality. I hope there won't be any physical confrontations...... 19
Something Like Punching Your Lights Out
   Promise Keepers' national staff has grown rapidly from a handful to 150,
with a $22 million budget.20 But its significance is primarily at the local
and church levels.
   Promise Keepers urges men to form "accountability" groups of no more than
five members, within which they are expected to submit all aspects of their
lives to review and rebuke. Each member must answer any probes concerning his
marriage, family, finances, sexuality, or business activity.21 (GZN Ed Note.:
Such cells are said to exist at Focus on the Family among their employees and
an employee that takes such things outside of their cell to discuss is in
serious trouble.)
   Such cells, usually operating within a church or parachurch group, are led
by a "Point Man" who answers to an "Ambassador" who reports to headquarters
in Boulder. Decisions about local or state activity are ultimately made in
Boulder.22
   "All of our success here is contingent upon men taking part in small
groups when they return home," Promise Keepers spokesman Steve Chavis told
Christianity Today. Less elegantly, Dave Wardell, the national coordinator
for local leaders, explains, "I can go home and maybe still be the same guy
after a conference. But if I have another guy calling up, holding me
accountable, asking, 'How are you treating your wife? Are you still cheating
on your income taxes? Are you looking at your secretaries with lust?' it
makes a difference. I don't think a woman would get in my face, go toe to toe
with a guy, whereas a guy could tell me, 'I don't like it. And if you don't
lis- ten to me, I'll punch your lights out.' Something like that."23
   These principles and structure, which are similar to the shepherding/
discipleship model of the Word of God, would take years to implement and
introduce a highly disciplined group. Most men drawn to Promise Keepers have
probably never heard of shepherding/discipleship (which is still not widely
known even within the evangelical community)24 and may be deeply offended if
they experience the degree of manipulation and control (to which they may be
"submitting" themselves and their families) as has occurred in many
shepherding/disciple situations.
Trojan Horses?
   Top Christian Right leaders in the last year have, joined Dobson in
promoting Promise Keepers. These have notably included Pat Robertson of the
Christian Coalition and 700 Club, D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries,
and Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ. Dobson, who along with
Robertson, Kennedy, and Bright, is a member of the secretive, radical-right
Council for National Policy, 25 is a central figure in Promise Keepers. Not
only is he the publisher of the main text of the movement, he is a featured
speaker at Promise Keeper events, which in turn sell tapes of his speeches.
   Focus on the Family's network of political action groups, called community
Impact Committees function much like Promise Keepers' cell groups within
conservative churches. Largely invisible to individuals outside these
churches, these committees are organized at the state and regional levels and
controlled from Colorado.26
   Both Dobson's Community Impact Committees and the Promise Keepers cells
are potential Trojan horses within churches and denominations, creating
conflicting loyalties and lines of authority. Leaders of Promise Keepers, in
particular, comes out of a movement that sees denominations as inhibiting
evangelism and revivalism. Indicative of this is its use of Strang
Communications to publish New Man magazine. Strang's Charisma magazine is
contemptuous of traditional denominations. The senior editor of Strang's New
Ministries magazine, Jack Hayford, is also on the board of Promise Keepers.
Promise Keepers has scheduled more than a dozen rallies for purity, fidelity
and possibly social and political dominion for 1995. Promise Keepers had
planned for over a year to draw one million men to a march in Washington,
D.C. just prior to the November 1996 elections. Now postponed, the plans were
evidently mod- eled after the Christian Right rallies called Washington for
Jesus which had similar backing and were held during the presidential
elections in 1980 and 1988.27
   Considering the high-level backing by the leadership of the Christian
Right, and the anti-democratic views of Promise Keepers' leaders, this
movement ought not be underestimated.

Subject:      Baudelaire
 
Here, as promised, are some versions of the same Baudelaire poem from
the book, _Spleen_, by Nicholas Moore, reprinted, Menard Press, 1990,
available from Peter Riley Books, 27 Sturton Street, Cambridge CB1 1QQ,
United Kingdom;
 
SPLEEN
 
Je suis comme le roi d'un pays pluvieux,
Riche, mais impuissant, jeune et pourtant tres-vieux,
Qui, de ses precepteurs meprisant les courbettes,
S'ennuie avec ses chiens comme avec d'autres betes.
Rien ne peut l'egayer, ni gibier, ni faucon,
Ni son peuple mourant en face du balcon.
Du bouffon favori la grotesque ballade
Ne distrait plus le front de ce cruel malade;
Son lit fleurdelise se transforme en tombeau,
Et les dames d'atour, pour qui tout prince est beau,
Ne savent plus trouver d'impudique toilette
Pour tirer un souris de ce jeune squelette.
Le savant qui lui fait de l'or n'a jamais pu
De son etre extirper l'element corrumpu,
Et dans ces bains de sang qui des Romains nous viennent,
Et donc sur leurs vieux jours les puissants se souviennent,
Il n'a su rechauffer ce cadavre hebete
Ou coule lieu de sang l'eau verte du Lethe.
 
 
 
LE ROY DELYCIEUX DE L'ICI
 
 
 
I am like the T.S. Eliot of new wastelands;
Fertile, but powerless; young, but with tied hands;
Despising pettiness in those who teach me.
Bored with this rat race, poodle-love can't reach me,
Pussies don't make me feel good, nor dumb birds;
Nor dying poets begging *me* for words.
Bob Dylan's witty, but grotesque new songs
Can't tear me from the sick thought of *my* wrongs....
 
Nicholas Moore
 
 
 
A BAD DREAM RECURRING
 
 
As the Ruler of a storm-flooded country, I
Am rich, but powerless, young, but terribly
Ancient, and all my ministers' sycophancy
Doesn't make up for my boredom with the beastly...
 
...Nor would pogroms - however Stalinesque -
Raise any new life that's not quite grotesque
Or warm the cockles of a skeletal
Heart - pumping water green as fear, and lethal.
 
"Ion Lomas-Roche"
 
 
DREAMSCAPE
 
 
I stand, a too-old king
In a too rainy country, curbed
By distrust of too-plausible advisers.
 
Dogs,
Other faceless animals,
Small birds, hawks
- but I'm bored;
A whole race fails beneath my balcony.
The Beatles, dressed like grubs,
Sing mournfully "Hey, Jude",
But I - I cannot laugh.
I suffer from the same malaise myself.
 
My bed is a mound of flowers,
Lily, iris;
The flower girls offer me charms
And suddenly strip -
Beautiful, clean young bodies.
 
But this mound is a tomb
For this dried-up young mummy.
The gesturing girls can't raise a smile
 
From the dead.
 
 
"Nichos Omolares"
 
 
RAT-KING
 
 
 
....Not all the lynchings of the Ku Klux Klan
Can make me sure I am the man I am.
I seem a marionette strung up on death,
While straggling Lethe greenly twists beneath.
 
 
"H.R. Fixon-Boumphrey"
 
 
 
PEPE-LE-MOKO AU MONTRACHET-LE-JARDIN
 
 
Beau Roi of Serpentines in thunderous mish-mash!
Golden glissadings, O empty effendi of air,
The tutors' fulgurations, fine flickerings of frenzy, leave
You like a Dodo in the abattoirs....
 
 
"P.L. Moko-Destaches"
 
 
 
etc
etc etc
etc etc etc
 
 
Sorry I've only time to excerpt from these translations, mostly from the
start or end....
 
 
Here is my own translation of Baudelaire's Madrigal Triste:
 
 
THE ORCHESTRATION OF UNHAPPINESS
 
                        - after Baudelaire
 
 
You're disciplined. So?
Get lusty, get lost. Desperation
is flow,
banked soil sails where the rivers go.
Get acceleration.
 
Lord! When emotion rejoices,
dissolving the edifice above it,
and your heart is where the horror of choice
is, when you're alive in the present, to hear the shut-out voices
of yesterday threaten full-throttle - God, how I love it!
 
I *love* it, when your eyes brim
and babble with weeping;
when, spurning my prim
reflex to soothe you, you let yourself swim
in the depth of it, and go out of my keeping.
 
I drink,
o deep, delicious, voluptuous one,
from this spring at the brink
of your body. I drink
as the knot is undone.
 
                                IRA LIGHTMAN
 
 
Anyone interested in the idea of Baudelaire's *style* get into Yeats?
I've just been reading Sarah Law's Baudelaire-style poem, Savage Nights,
in the Cambridge magazine, _Involution ii_, and it reminded me of Yeats.
 
Anyway, hope this offers some starting points for Baudelaire talk...

Oh thank God, I'm heading off to Mexico after Christmas. I should be
able to get it in duty free by using the Canadian Council Against Renga
as a cover and claiming the cure as a cultural aid. If anyone wants
I'll smuggle some of this miracle cure into Canada amd then sell it in US
markets.  I should make a killing off the exchange rates.  I'm taking
orders starting immediately.  Finally a way to easy our suffering, if only
I could leave now.

Maria: Kevin Mitchell's an overweight, overpaid, injury-prone, underachieving,
peripatetic outfielder with the Reds, the Giants, a Japanese team, and God
knows who else before or since. Sorta like Ron.
 
Ryan: Some of Michael Harper's books that I have here are History is Your Own
Heartbeat (1971), Nightmare Begins Responsibility (1975), Images of Kin
(1977), Healing Song for the Inner Ear (1985). I don't know what he's done
since the mid-eighties. Like many other writers, he has a number of Coltrane
poems, and perhaps his best-known (or most anthologized) poem is "Dear John,
Dear Coltrane. " I taught this at the U of Mississippi years back and played
"A Love Supreme," off which the poem riffs, but the effort met with a
resounding "Huh?" (Actually, Trane met with the resounding "Huh?" and Harper
merely with a lower-case "huh.") Would like to know what you thought of his
reading, since I've never heard him. We've thought of him at various times as
a possible reader at the Twentieth-Century Lit. Conference here.
 
I'm trying to think of a crack about derengalation to end this with, but
can't.
  Oh well.

Dear List:
 
Since I've mentioned the Conference in passing in another post today, might as
well do my annual schtick. So:
 
The call for papers and for poetry and fiction submissions is now out for the
U. of Louisville's annual Twentieth-Century Literature Conference, to be held
Feb. 22-24, 1996. Deadline for submissions is an Oct. 2 postmark. Keynote
speakers are not yet set, but I'll post that information when they are. For
further info., including a hard copy of the conference flier with lots more
detail, e-mail the Conference director, Harriette Seiler, at
hmseil01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu.
 
A lot of people on the Poetics list came last year, which meant that *I* had a
good time, and I think they did too.
 
PS: Harriette Seiler's away for a week or two, so don't be concerned if you
don't get a response right away.

Alan,
 
Thanks for the titles.  I heard harper read "Nightmare Begins
Responsibility" and I think three or four more poems in the
"Language of Life" series currently running on PBS this side of
the medicine line.  I think slick is the best word.  He
was reading with a jazz trio, very beat, but reminded me in
his language and style of Amiri Baraka, AM/TRAK and thereabouts.
What amazed me is his sense of performance vs. reading, demonstrated
best by his interpretations of some inner-city poets' works. After him
came Adrienne Rich and it was night and day, for me.  Rhythm seems
to be an extension of content and in some cases content itself.
 
Oh yeah, renga.

Only the Good Die Young
 
 
You know where this is going but I don't. Anyone who went through the 60s,
rubbed themselves raw in the middle to late 60s and early 70s, against the
right in America that's now breathing down our necks with the fury of
missed and regulated life - anyone who went through them caught in the war
of the peace - has been traumatized, amputated, has learned to bury well,
never say "far out" again because it's all reigned in, has learned to walk
the walk, talk the talk -
 
Has learned to bury early on Janis and Jimmy and John and John and Al and
Robert and Abbie and Martin and Marvin and those who burned bright for a
second, just when we were beginning to learn to fuck them, open our
bodies, insurrections of the flesh -
 
How did Jerry survive so long, get away with it, these little murders
splitting out bodies open - we weren't taught that life was one long
series of deaths, only that death was there on the horizon, present yes,
but not these little murders -
 
We're fucking survivors, the Net's a commune, the last Free Press, we're
on the edge, waiting for insurrection, of the other, of ourselves, splin-
tered on the bones of a country we barely recognize -
 
Cause otherwise we're all sleep for the slaughter - little murders on down
the line - take us -
 
'She wander'd in the lad of clouds thro' valleys dark, list'ning
Dolours & lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy grave
She stood in silence, list'ning to the voices of the ground,
Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down,
And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.
 
'"Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?
"Or the glist'ning Eye to the poison of a smile?
"Why are Eyelids stor'd with arrows ready drawn,
"Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie?
"Or an Eye of gifts & graces show'ring fruits & coined gold?
"Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?
"Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?
"Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, & affright?
"Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?
"Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?"'
 
(Blake, The Book of Thel)

dear alan, dear ryan,
i heard harper read a few years ago and his renditions of etheridge knight's
poetry were much more powerful than his readings of his own material.  he read
some really boring recent stuff of his, stuff like, for richard wilbur on his
xxth birthday, "i gave you a bottle of scotch," etc.  Only on request did he
read the older, far more powerful "Dear John" and the one for Bessie Smith?
"this is our last affair"(?)  gorgeous.  but what he's doing now...uninspired,
as far as i could tell.  i don't know if he was doing that on purpose because of
the incredible conservatism of my department, who hosted the reading (helP! get
me out of here!) or if that's how it is these days in general.  also he recently
edited a book of AF-Am poetry called Every Shut Eye Ain't Asleep, in which he
omitted Bob Kaufman and others with an eye toward "quality."  oh well.  he has
been very good to some younger writers, including novelist Gayl Jones, who's a
knockout.

For immediate release:
ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL PASSES RESOLUTION CALLING FOR NEW TRIAL FOR MUMIA
ABU-JAMAL
 
Aug.7--The City Council of Ann Arbor, MI tonight passed a resolution
calling for a new trial for Pennsylvania political prisoner Mumia
Abu-Jamal and that his death sentence be set aside.  Ann Arbor now joins
Detroit, Madison, and Cambridge, MA as the fourth American city council
to pass such a resolution.  The resolution was passed by an 8-1 majority
and the effort to win the resolution was initiated by members of the Ann
Arbor-based Emergency Committee Against the Racist Execution
(Emergency CARE: 313-913-9538 / plefr@umich.edu).
 
It is significant to note that the resolution was passed despite the fact
that earlier in the day Mumia Abu-Jamal had been granted a stay of
execution.  There was some discussion on the Council about whether the
resolution was still necessary given the stay.  Emergency CARE members
addressed the Council and pointed out that the death sentence still loomed over
Mumia's head, that he was still in Judge Sabo's court, and that he had not
been granted a new trial.  They pointed out that it was getting similar
resolutions passed in other cities--a direct result of a mass worldwide
movement--that helped create the political climate in which today's court
victory could even be won.
 
Earlier, Emergency CARE members joined forces with approximately forty
members of the Coalition for Community Unity (CCU) who were picketing
prior to the meeting.  CCU initiated its picket in response to
the near-unanimous vote of City Council last week in which the Council
capitulated to police pressure and backed down from demanding an immediate
return of the blood and DNA samples obtained from 160 area Black men during
the highly racist police "investigation" of the now-solved serial rape case.
No action was taken on that issue at the Monday night City Council meeting.
 
Emergency CARE members are currently organizing for the August 12
national protest in Philadelphia demanding a new trial for Mumia
Abu-Jamal, a stop to the execution, an end to the racist death penalty,
and a halt to the agenda of the right-wing.  The victory won today only
hardened members' determination to continue the fight. We will not be
placated!
 
FREE MUMIA ABU-JAMAL AND ALL OTHER LIBERATION FIGHTERS!
ABOLISH THE RACIST DEATH PENALTY!

Dear everybody -
 
I didn't catch the name of the poet included in the second part of "the
language of life."  She read "night vision."  Of course, I could do a
search by title, but I'd rather display my ignorance before oodles of
complete strangers.
 
I'd say Cruz was the heat of the day, Harper the beat of the night, and
Rich wore the deceptive calm of the indoors.

Dear Chris:
 
I apologize for such a tardy response. I came acrosss your message tonight
while looking on past posts for meanings of renga (something I am still
unclear on). I must have missed your post first time around. Not paying
enough attention I guess.
 
I'm not sure what happened via backchannel but try again please, if only to
test the address blairsea@panix.com. If you know of any studios, I'd be
interested to hear about them.
 
Thanks for your trouble. Best wishes.
Blair
 
By the way where are you located geographically?
 
 
Dear Chris:
 
That was then and this is now. Apparently I got bounced last night, not
only from your address, but from the poetics list. So here we go on a
second round. By the way, your address above
(LSO796%ALBNYVMS.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU) is not the one I used, not as far
as I know. I believe I copied your address verbatim
(LS0796@ALBNYVMS.BITNET). In any event, I am now more interested in seeing
if this message gets through, than I am in finding out about studio spaces.
 
 
I wonder if I was bounced from the poetics list because I only used a
subject heading and left the body empty?
 
Please contact me Chris, if necessary use the poetics list and make the
subject my name. That way, I have a better chance of catching your post,
since I get my poetics mail bundled.
 
Best wishes
Blair

Kevin Mitchell was the Most Valuable Player for the National League in
1989, I believe, the year he hit 47 homers to lead the league. He once
caught a line drive in left field with his bare hand. But he did grow
up in the San Diego ghetto and still hangs with his childhood buddies.

No.  Say that and I promise I'll punch your lights out.
 
(Oops-- had my fingers crossed just then.  Peace, mon.  Seriously
one very seldom hears that phrase uttered without a tinge of ironic
self-citation, as though in scary-sarcastic quotation marks.  Same with
"politically correct."  Even Marvin Gaye seems to be laughing at himself
--or some *autre*--when he sprechsings it in "What's Goin' On."  We'd say,
"Right arm, man."  Polar opposite of "right face" or "dress right, dress,"
so it felt at the time.  Nowadays I reach back a bit farther and,
following Creeley, just say "dig.")

Aha: I thought Dodie might have meant that the offending post portrayed Russian
caucasians like Trotsky as congenitally unable to keep from exploiting needy
third-world lab technicians, setting up sweatshops despite his professedly
communist political stance.  Thanks for setting me straight on that.
 
Personally, I view the Rengba virus as God's revenge on those who carped about
the Anti-Hegemony Project taking up too much list-space a while back.
You know,
the type of people who come down with it . . .

 excuse me i say right on and groovy all the time.  others impute an irony to my
using those phrases (assuming no one could say them "straight" anymore), but i'm
just saying it. saying it. saying it.  come to mpls and i'll say it for you a
coupla times.  or rather, since i'm going on sabbatical, come to cape cod (YAY!)
and i'll say it for you a coupla times.--md

A mess o' Yasusada material turned up in the recent _Grand Street_-- the
contributors notes on the translators carefully avoid any traceable

particular university. (The work in _GS_ by the way, not as well done as

        That bare-handed line drive, as I recall, was off the bat of
Ozzie Smith.  Didn't he also play for the Giants for a while?  Ronald
Reagan had some silly things to say about him when he (Reagan) did the
"color" commentary on one of the All Star Games.  That was when Reagan
called a Hispanic player Jose (just how it's spelled, mind you).
 
        signed, a sad Cardinals fan.

[forwarded message]
 
 
Announcing a new journal on the internet:
 
*Electronic Book Review,* a working forum promoting innovative writing
on the internet and in print, is soliciting articles for the Fall of
1995.  Initial topics will include talklists, network publishing, the
political economy of the internet, and the electronic future of
poetry, criticism, drama, and literary fiction.
 
Reviews should be both timely and capable of stimulating discussions beyond
the moment of a title's publication.  We would prefer thoughtful
overviews, polemics, and review essays to evaluations of single
works.  Serial submissions of chapters from work in progress are
welcome, and we will occasionally sponsor on-line publication of books
in advance of their appearance in print.
 
Issue #1, scheduled for November, is being organized in collaboration
with the *American Book Review*.  It will feature reviews of selected
electronic journals and talklists, as well as reflections on "books"
that can only be read electronically.  Essays of 1200-1500 words
received by September 15 will be considered for this issue.
 
For issue #2, we are organizing an email essay forum around an
original essay by Michael Berube, "Cultural Criticism and the Politics
of Selling Out."  Additional forums are scheduled for two
collections of new writing: *Chick-Lit (On the Edge: New Women's
Fiction)* [ed. Cris Mazza and Jeffrey DeShell] and
*The Future of Literary Fiction* [ed. David Foster Wallace].
 
During the first year of operation, we will feature essays and
reviews by Mark Amerika, Michael Berube, Linda Brigham, David
Cassuto, Carolyn Guyer, Paul Harris, Katherine Hayles, Michael Joyce,
Nancy Kaplan, Peter Krapp, Laura Marks, Knut Mork, Marcos Novak,
Martin Rosenberg, Alison Sainsbury, Ronald Sukenick, W. S. Wilson,
Gregory Ulmer, and Walter Vaninni.
 
EBR will be stored at and distributed from Alt-X (located at
http://www.altx.com).

What used to get baseball purists mad at Kevin Mitchell was that he
had enormous skills but did not know much about baseball, and said
that it was just the money he was interested in, and he was no
baseball fan. I think that bothered his detractors more than his
scrapes with the law.

Subject:      Padgett's definition
 
From _Handbook of Poetic Forms_, edited by Ron Padgett:
 
"Renga are long, image-filled poems written in alternating
stanzas of three lines and two lines, usually by a group of
poets who take turns. In Japan, where renga originated as a
party game, poets used to make renga of 1,000 or more
stanzas, although 100 stanzas was the usual length. The great
poet Matsuo Basho (1644-1694) preferred renga of thirty-six
stanzas, and this continues to be the popular length today.
...Renga do not read like stories; each stanza "links" to
the one before it, but not to the one before that...The first
six or eight stanzas are like the beginning of a party, when
people introduce one another, a bit formally. In the middle
twenty to twenty-four stanzas the party warms up, with stanzas
that include humor and the whole range of human emotions. A
renga ends with six or eight stanzas that move quickly through
closely related images, with simple, straightforward linking,
like the end of the party, when everyone gets ready to go home.
Traditionally, the last stanza has a spring image, indicating
hopefulness and peace..." Etc., including examples.
 
I'm finding many of the posted "renga" lines very graceful, and
am all for playfulness, the posting of poems, use of received
forms. But does anyone else find it weird, at least, that we
are writing so-called renga, and kvetching about so-called
renga, when for the most part we have no idea what they are?
 
And is it the "exoticism" of renga (the non-whiteness of them?)
that makes them glam enough for us to fool around with, when
for the most part, we wouldn't be caught dead in the McCarthyite
"market strategy" of sonnet-writing (Ted Berrigan and others
notwithstanding)?
 
Thought I'd ask...

Not to be caught dead, oh sonneteer
As if the wound festers, disease
Or other thing, a faulty ear
Hearing what politicians please
To call their own, discomfort
In our postmodernity
While gallantly we reinsert
Ignorance as prosperity.
There's politics in everything we do
Beyond the obvious; the obvious, not so
Although the obvious is never true
I'd think, at least in email, imho.
Cut the ranks of renga's weary tone,
Our ignorance, or throw the form a bone.

Subject:      "marketing strategies"
 
Herb Levy,
 
I'm coming in very late on this, but was quite intrigued by
what you had to say about the writing of sonnets being
possible today only as a "marketing strategy." (Forgive me
if I'm not quoting you exactly, but I think I have the sense).
 
First, could you define "marketing strategy"? How does it
differ from style, say, or any other honey we use, as writers,
to catch flies?
 
The writing of the new formalists hasn't interested me, but
not because they *are* formalists--rather because the poems
themselves have seemed warmed-over and bland.
 
It seems to me that theory, not form, is the real marketing
strategy, in literature at least. In science a theory is
used to test a hypothesis, but in literature theory is used,
far too often, to carry a whole school of writers--the bad
along with the good--into prominence. It is used as an excuse
to stop thinking, to stop reading widely, to circle the
wagons. It is, essentially, fear, in an intellectual form.
Rather than testing a hypothesis, and breaking new ground,
theory in literary hands seems to be used as an instrument of
enforcement, prescribing the sorts of poems (or fictions or
whatever) which are to be written.
 
I was fascinated when someone on this list, looking for the
almost mythical Cap-l, land of the new formalists, said that
what they wanted was (paraphrased) a real snail darter,
McCarthyite, sonnet-writing list (wish I could quote exactly,
it was beautifully expressed). Disappointingly, the new
formalists don't seem to be over there, although an increasingly
Talmudic discussion of metrics among *old* formalists led to
frustrated explosions from other members of the list, and then
to silence. Still, the longing was there, for the *other*,
whatever weird web-footed creature that might be. In fact, the
most interesting thing that did happen on Cap-l, before its
apparent demise, was a dialogue between Ron Silliman and
Alfred Corn on "parallel traditions" in which I learned vastly
more about Silliman's work than I ever have on POETICS. Why
might that be?
 
More questions, asked with affection and respect...

Yikes--flames smart, and smart flames smart the more smartly.
 
But no, not anti-semitic except to those who think of semites as a race.
They're no more so than are Mexicans--which is what I was kidding about
before Jorge decided, in all sincerity, that he had to spell it all out.

Certain phenomena, I would argue, can only be adequately described (and
"adequately" is a judgment call on my part, of course) by the use of the
word "groovy."  So, right on, Maria, I'm with you.  (In spirit only, natch.)

Possibly, but I think people basically are getting some joy from inventing
lines of poetry (and yes, many graceful, intriguing ones) and from the
people with whom they are inventing -- whether it be renga or sonnet or
villanelle. Although perhaps no matter what the form, we would be
circumventing and developing it wholly without consideration of what its
historical shape and function are.
 
Rachel, does Padgett say or imply then, that in a traditional renga,
alternating stanzas are written by different poets, rather than alternate
lines being written by different poets?
 
all best,
charles

There was a book about a decade ago - The 60s without Apology I think)
(edited by Stanley Aronowitz - I forget the details) with an article on
60s language, its relation to the body, its body-centeredness (body-
states, meanderings) - and how these terms have been lost as the body's
been resutured, recuperated as Kristeva's clean and proper body (my own
interpretation, see Powers of Horror), everything conjoined once again.
So that JG and others can be seen in light of that, re: Blake again, the

Welcome Rachel and thanks.
 
Another nonwhite thing which (unlike amateur (i.e. `lover') renga) is
marketable is the pantoum.  We should look into that.
 
So long as I "have" "my" `coffee' `I' will not be `caught' "dead " in the
"marketplace" `of' "ideas".
 
Query: Who was the McCarthy who wrote sonnets or promoted them?

On the contrary, Burt, I think the typo is awfully interesting, and I
plan to free-associate on "a pound of St. Jerome" later. Is worth an

Jorge,
 
The reference is to Senator Joe, (R-Wisconsin). We have yet
to find his cache of sonnets--and what a discovery that will
be--but he was symbolized, in my red-diaper babyhood, by the

i believe that the terms "stanzas" and "lines" (and, for
that matter, "syllable") are not _exact_ translations for
what actually happens in Japanese--some translators,
for instance, render japanese haiku as a single line...
 
from _From The Country of Eight Islands_, edited by Hiroaki Sato &
Burton Watson:
 
"Toward the end of the Heian period, poets composing in the tanka
form began to follow a tendency to divide the 31-syllable form and
organize images into two smaller parts of 5-7-5 and 7-7 syllables.
By the fourteenth centruy, such a division had made dominant the poetic
form of renga, in which usually two or more poets wrote alternating
5-7-5 and 7-7 syllable parts.  Although any two consecutive parts--but
not mare--of a renga were to relate directly, such linking did permit
the development of longer poetic structures...The amount of concentration
and cooperation required for successful renga composition might be
compared with the challenge of playing chamber music: in both cases,
each participant must listen carefully to his companions as well as
to himself in order to keep the momentum boing.  The pleasure of
 "performing" poetry in a group, already an important element in
the tanka contests of the imperial court, flowered in the cooperative
esthetic of the renga."
 
the translations this book provide seem to render the parts (5-7-5
and 7-7 "syllable" "lines") as single english lines; most but not
all of these parts are by alternating poets, but occasionally a
single poet will contribute several parts in a row...
 
also:
 
"in content, there were two kinds of renga: the formal serious kind that
stressed elegance in the court poetry tradition, and the light humorous
kind that stressed earthiness and realism.  The latter, known as haikai
no renga or simply haikai, often overwhelmed the serious renga in sheer
popularity...
 
hmmm... i wonder which of those two kinds we're most akin to here?...
 
and i wonder if those tanka contests were like poetry slams??

I am starting a new mailing list, collab-mus, for discussion of
collaborative music-making that involves improvisation. My own
interest centers on relatively recent real-time interactive
composition related to post-war avant garde traditions (for
instance, Stockhausen's Aus den Seiben Tagen, Oliveros's Sonic
Meditations, the Inter/Play sessions of Boretz, Randall, and
others), but discussions of interactive improvisation in any
kind of music will be appropriate.
 
Contributions to the list could include scores for
interactions; reports of experiences as performer or listener;
discussions of aesthetic, ethical, and political issues;
reports and discussions on analogous collaborative enterprises
in media other than sound (for instance, collaborative poetry-
writing; MOOing). In keeping with the topic, the list is
unmoderated and will take whatever direction its contributors
give it.
 
To subscribe to the list, write to <majordomo@virginia.edu>.
Leave the subject line blank. The message should consist of the
command "subscribe collab-mus" followed by your email address.
(If you give no address, the return address of the message will
be subscribed.)

rachel, it seems to me that anything can be used this way becuz face it,
academia is not full of original, intellectually adventurous sorts, and
categorization can be used as intellectual shorthand for not dealing with ideas.
"theory" is, i think, just a word, when u think of, say, the differences between
lacan, deleuze and stuart hall, it seems incongruous that the same word is used
to either fetishize or dismiss them.  but i agree that labels and categories
more often stultify than enable thinking and engagement.  i never read the
"objectivists" before this summer, when i saw carl rakosi read at naropa and was
captivated, because i was put off by the category and terminology of
"objectivist" --i thought one had to be really smart to read them, so i never
did.

i could tell you a lot about the politics of this list, the cap-l, since many of
the originating participants are in my department.  mcCarthyite is not, in my
view, too strong a term. i'm glad the list has been injected w/ silliman,
stroffolino and other people with brains, open minds and reasonable politics,
who can rise above the knee-jerk conservatism of some of these folks (many of
them boycotted a recent reading by kathleen frazer because they'd heard a rumor
that she was a "language poet.") i coujld go on and on, but the whole thing
makes me really angry and that's indecorous.

I'm a seventies kid too and find myself using cool, awesome, excellent,
and have recently picked up chill, take a pill, well-fuck-me-Jesus (oh, I
think I made that one up), fuckwad, fuckhead... and meanwhile constantly
weeding my "likes".  And remember wicked? Wicked excellent. Also I've
taken to refering to myself in my less noble moments as a hosebeast. I
suppose Wayne and Garth have influenced my language more than Bernadette
Mayer even.
 
That's kind of, like, depressing.
 
Anybody have favorite swears? Preferably offensive to somebody's
religion, race, creed, ethnicity, veteran status, disability, gender, or
sexual orientation -- just not mine.
 
;)
 
(Hey, we should invent "smiley" swears.) Figure this one out:  ****
 
And now, for serious discussion: what do people think of swears in poetry?
Speaking of Bernadette Mayer--I think she uses them beautifully.

If it's not too e-gauche to post two advertisements the same day, I'd like to
invite list-readers in the NY area to a reading on Sunday August 20th at 5
pm, at the Biblios Cafe. Biblios is located on Church Street between
Lispenard and Walker (meaning it's around the corner from the Pearl Paint on
Canal Street). I'll be reading with my friend Tim Griffin, who writes for the
Print Collector's Newsletter and whose play, "Fingerprints", will be staged
this fall.

My father picked up my mother's family's Polish pieties and used them as
swears: "Matka boskiej Czestochowa!" He also coined my all-time favorite
swear: "Jesus H. Christ on a fucking life raft!"
 
The all-time great swear in poetry has to be Larkin's "They fuck you up,
your mum and dad."

Interesting, since I just said to GB that nobody can swear or say CRAP
quite like Sharon Thesen (thinking of her poem to Brian Fawcett: oooh,
nasty nasty; love that stuff)  There's fine use of bad language in poetry.
I mean, I didn't know whang had an h in it.  Learn somethin everyday.

   dear rachel loden--thanks for your thoughtful response to herb levy
   about the cliquishness---whether or not the CAp-L people are McCarthyites
   I think must be an oversimplification--I catch myself speaking of
   "formally conservative poets" as conservatives, and am glad I have a
   couple of AWP-type friends. Of course, the "left",("this list we're
   on", whatever....) does tend to elide the difference between the
   more working class Levine types and the more James Merrill types
   --and I think there should be more dialogue between
   "various factions" rather than the balkanized inbreeding of any
   clique--and though i myself have not written "sonnets" since I tried
   some puerile ones long ago--I am definitely open to discussion of
   them--There does seem to be an abiding distate of anything that seems
   "conservative." I mean, even Phillip Larkin (WHO HATED JAZZ and was
    politically conservative) in his poems at times seems to speak from
    a leftist perspective--or could be read as such---furthermore, there
    is something VERY GENERATIVE in his work that it seems ridiculous for
    someone to deny on ostensibly "political" grounds--It seems many
    readers are so queasy about "the great tradition" as if the mere act
    of reading a fascist (oh, an dissertations on Yeats "fascist metrics"
    abound) WILL MAKE YOU (i mean ONE) a fascist....
    And maybe Rachel (though your question was probably rhetorical) the
    reason you learned something from the Corn-Silliman debate was because
    it was NOT as claustrophobic as the little "divided left" debates that
    occur here (the L poets vs. the M--remember that one!)--I hope for
    more of such--so thank you, Chris Stroffolino

        This talk about seventies-speak got me remembering
those strange words kids on my block used before we were brave
enough, and before the disintegration of "the block" led us, to use the real
swear words.  The only one i can think of now that was
exclusive to our street was "gary," an adjective or noun meaning
something like "awkward, square, feeble," that was meant to deride, e.g.,
"shut up, you gary" or "you're so gary, get out of here."  It had no
etymology, really, b/c no one named gary lived anywhere near us.
(apologies to all garys on the list.)  --brian
 
nowdays, however, my favorite interjection is jesus-shit.

To all:
 
        The creative writing program at the University of Hawai'i does
not advertise for its Visiting Distinguished Writers (as they are
called), but it is possible to express interest in being one by writing
to Prof. Robbie Shapard, Dept of English, 1733 Donaghho Road, U of
Hawai'i, Honolulu, HI 96822.  The positions are for one semester, and I
have no idea what they pay (the going rate, I suspect).  Because the
process has been so mysterious, the writers have tended to be of a kind,
which hasn't been so much a bad thing, as a predictable one.  I, for one,
would love to see people on this list apply.  If anyone wants more
information, I can muster it up.

re Larkin's "They fuck you up" -- Raworth has comment on that in the _Exact

". . . the terrible drabness of Larkin (whom I imagine wrote "They tuck you
up/your mum and dad" then rode the wave of a typo)."
 
not seventies, but a recent citing, Padgett seems to be getting mentioned
alot, in his memoir _Ted_ he mentions "freaked his gobble" as in "Man, I
freaked her gobble!"
 
a W.Va. bit I like is "Holy Mackeral Andy!" as an expression of pleasant
surprise. Another one is "Heck-A-Fire-Wiz!" -- the "meaning" of that one is
not exactly clear.
 
But, I have to say nothing yet touches the aforementioned "Well fuck me

does anyone else from boston remember the laudatory adjective "pissa"? as in,
that's a wicked pissa shirt, man.  when i taught at the full circle high school
i overheard a writing teacher trying to get this one kid to use adjectives other
than "good" to describe the way a band played.  the kid wrote, saying it aloud
as he did in that questioning voice people use when trying to supply synonyms,
"they played wicked pissa."

If I recall correctly, "marketing strategy" is a rather flip phrase used in
a hastily written post to POETICS, used to imply a particularly
self-conscious use of a particular range of earlier styles. But you're
right, it isn't much different from style. Though in the context of you
later statement (about theory, rather than form, being the real marketing
strategy in literature, which seems true in many ways), this kind of
appropriation of "classical" styles _is_ as much more about theory than it
is about form. It just that the theory involved states that forms with
enough past history communicate transparently, but that these forms are
solid enough to hide the rest of the theory behind them.

I've always thought of CAP-L as more of an often neglected (literal, not a
BBS) bulletin board in a hallway lined by faculty office with the doors
closed, except for the few, very rare, attempts at conversation. In any
case, there really don't seem to be a very high percentage of active "new
formalists" posting there. Of course, CAP-L is generally quite low volume
(especially compared to POETICS, even discounting all of the renga lines,
which must be deeply discounted indeed), so it's hard to say who really is
there. CAP-L will be good for a few messages as soon as the next "famous"
"mainstream" poet dies, or the next "big awards" are announced.
 
If CAP-L were any less inactive, I might remember to unsubscribe, but now
that you remind me, where _did_ I put my copy of the listserv refcard?

>might that be?
 
If this is still directed at me, you're, obviously, asking the wrong
person, but I'm willing to make some brief comments.
 
 
First, if CAP-L is like a neglected faculty bulletin board, POETICS is more
like a bar frequented by people who know a lot about writing within the
tradition of poetic innovation (which is probably why Ron Silliman doesn't
feel he has to explain his work, or the tradition it comes out of, here).
 
Second,  in some ways, the Silliman/Corn exchange was an example of theory
as marketing strategy. Ron Silliman made a very good, best-case description
of the tradition of poetic innovation in the context of a group of people
who don't seem to question the more staid Norton anthologies very much,
though they don't seem to have noticed the more recent, and more diverse,
additions to the Norton family of blunt implements. (Talk about marketing
strategies as cynicism, but that's a different discussion.) If the
Silliman/Corn dialogue got one more faculty member to consider taking a
left turn after Lowell or Plath, it was worth it.
 
But note that forays onto CAP-L by folks from POETICS (at least those since
last winter) have invariably ended when someone on CAP-L says "okay, you've
made your point about what some of the problems with OUR stuff are, can you
give an example of an inferior work in the "parallel tradition," so that we
have some kind of idea 0f how YOUR aesthetics operate." So far no one from
POETICS has been willing to say "yeah, here's something that was published
in Origin (or Acts, or Aerial, or Alcheringa, or Avec, to go through some
of the more recent journals on the shelf behind me) & it is really, really
bad."
 
This leads into what may be a third comment, or at least a kind of
meta-comment on POETICS. In exchange for the high level of camaraderie (and
the apparently related high degree of renga) available on POETICS, there's
a perhaps understandable unwillingness to dig too deeply into any of the
stylisitic, theoretical, or formal differences that separate POETICS'
various denizens.
 
We don't all appreciate the same works equally, or for the same reasons, on
(or off) POETICS, even though we often act as if we do. A few months ago
someone missed the sarcasm (few smileys are seen here at POETICS, I'm happy
to say) when I posited the term "the kind of poetry we're all interested
in" as a definition of the kind of poetry we're all interested in.
 
Now, negative definition is a powerful means of bonding a group. But, just
because "none of us" are "really" "CAP-L," whatever any of that may mean,
doesn't mean we're all the same. To go back to CAP-L example you raised
(*example alert*: one could fill in just about any writer's name where I
have, in this instance, used the term "Ron Silliman" and the meaning of
this sentence would not change), not everyone here likes, or even knows,
Ron Silliman's work. In some ways it would be helpful for there to be a
more detailed discourse on any specific writer on POETICS. So go ahead &
start with whoever you like.
 
"Mind the gap." The differences on POETICS (even unacknowledged) are a good
part of what keeps us together. That, and a tremendous fear of completing a
sentence in a neo/non-tradtional renga.
 
At least until the next issue of Apex of the M (&, uh, except for Aram
Saroyan's, which had 3, and may not really have been an "M" anyway, doesn't
every "M" have two apexes?) comes out. But few of the distinctions that
came out in that earlier discussion were clear (though they were much
belabored), and the clearest distinctions pertained to (the often
execrable) editorial politics rather than poetics.
 
I'm not suggesting  that people start badmouthing each other on (or off)
POETICS, just calling attention to some of the unacknowledged limitations
of having such a happy, renga-loving community "here."
 
Bests,

Subject:      The List Itself
 
For the second time this week, but only for the third time in the history of
the list, there were over 50 messages posted to Poetics on Friday.  When this
happens the list locks itself automatically, and Listserv sends me a message
that I have to unlock it by sending out an unlock message.  At 10am this
morning I did this and something like 30 messages that had been held were
released.
      I think 50 is a reasonable upper limit for daily messages.  But as I am
not online every day, especially during the summer, there is a potential
problem here.
 
As many of you know, if you change your user ID you also need to unsub to
Poetics under the old name and resub under the new name or you will not be
able to send posts.  If you have a problem with this send me a message with
the old address and I can delete it manually.  You should be able to resub
yourself with the new address without problem.
      If you are having any problem with your account, or our nearing the disk
quota, please unsub yourself.  I get hundreds of bounced Poetics messages a
week from servers that have can't deliver a Poetics message and these are, to
say the least, a nuisance.  The worst instance of this was some mad recycling
of bounced messages from one subscriber's system last week, to the tune of
3000 error messages a day for a couple of days, effectively closing my own e-
mail account down.  Subscribers who bounce messages are removed from the
Poetics list so if this happens, once you've solved the problems that caused
the messages to bounce, just resub yourself.
 
All of this reminds me of my commitment to keep the scale of this list on the
smaller side, not only because I am committed to small-scale exchanges but
also because this particular list is not set up -- _I'm not set up!_ -- to
handle more volume than we've now got.  I have noted before that sheer volume
on a list has as much of a tendency to exclude, by effectively preventing
participation by those unable to sort through the volume, as more explicit
means of limiting subscription.  For some using sophisticated software, or
indeed having easier access to the net, sorting through this volume may be
less a problem than it is for, I suspect, many Poetics subscribers.  This is
all changing very quickly.  My hope is that with the Eisnerization of the net,
we have some basic alternative sites, EPC and Poetics are two models, firmly
in place. But I certainly don't have the answers and see Poetics as only one
of many possible formats for listserve poetry discussion groups.
 
I often feel that the time I spend on list maintenance actually keeps me from
posting more, but this is, for now, my principal method of participation.

A few choice swears from the bookstore where I work.  We make it a point
of honor to come up with a couple of new epitaths a week.  Heres a crop in
current circulation:
 
1. pizzle-head       origin unknown, but probably a derivational coinage from
                     pissant, a word which my boss used once, to the great
                     hilarity of the staff)
 
2. monkey boy        from _Buckaroo Banzai_, a secret slack-generation
                     film classic)
 
3. hapless catamite  coined by a gay friend to describe someone so obsessed
                     with his sexuality that he is unable to carry on a
                     conversation about anything else except "is X gay or
                     straight?"
 
4. skanky wheezer    all variants now in some disfavor, as "skank" is
   skank-meister     currently considered to be a somewhat recherche term.
   Roi du Skank      Also, we are currently experiencing a revival of
                     Ska, and many afficanodos object to the perjorative
                     detournemant of what they consider a positive word.)
 
5.hungry-monkey      a term coined by Salem--a former Marine--who traces
                     this phrase to his stint in the Phillipines during the
                     Mt. Pinatubo eruption.  One of his tasks at the time
                     was to hunt down & shoot gangs of crazed monkeys who
                     would invade the base in search of cast-off
                     MREs(Meals-Ready to Eat--basically, Military TV
                     dinners), & often fight pitched battles against
                     each other with rocks & anything else they could
                     throw.)
 
6. Mr. Weasel        accompanied by the lip-smacking & sucking sounds that
                     this minor Warner Brothers cartoon figure made
                     whenever in the presence of food.  Used to describe
                     a lecher or anyone whose demeanor at any time betrays an
                     immodestly excessive interest in the physical
                     attributes or amorous potential of another.)
 
7. Christ on a bike! (a ejaculatory term of amazement.  My college friend
                      Pat says that this is an common phrase from the
                      Michigan UP, though I've never heard anyone but my
                      co-workers say it.)
 
8. Pendejocito        a variation from the classic by my roomate Hugo to
                      describe someone whose calumny was either
                      unintentional or insufficiently offensive to
                      warrant the full word)
 
8. Driver of the gravy train (a perjorative term for either an excessive
                              optimist or someone whose delight threatens
                              to overwhelm the dour mood of another.
                              From _The Ruling Class_, a wonderful British
                              movie about a delusional fellow who shifts in
                              personality from Jesus Christ to Jack the
                              Ripper.)
 
 
Also, a common death phrase:  "there ain't enough left of him/her to
                               spread on toast."  (said of someone either
                               long or violently dead.)
 
And as is customary at the bkstore, I'll end with a common phrase of
departure:  Screw You! Click. (then imitate the sound of a dead telephone line.)

yes, plus, the fact that "semites" aren't a race doesn't mean it's not possible
to degrade them as a group --hence the word "anti-semitic"--md

Holy shit, I haven't thought of that in years. Thanks, Maria. Kids really
still say that? Amazing.
 
I'd always thought to spell it "pisser," though. & I wouldn't spell the

expected more meat and less filler, especially the renga

Cris, I thought that somebody in the London or New York or one of the
famous stodgy reviews of books alleged that the line originally read
"They do you harm, your father and mother" until Larkin's editor
convinced him to be a bit more pungent.

The "AWP experiences" I've had are too much of a long, strange trip to
recount here, since (I admit this now, before everyone, so there are no
illusions) I work for them as an editor on the _Chronicle_. I actually
did feel like I knew what you meant by "AWP type," since I deal with a
lot of them on the phone--poets for whom the kindest possible adjective
is "mid-list." Yet Carolyn Forche' is on the Board of Directors, and she
routinely assigns her classes things like the great big Sun & Moon
anthology, Dragomoschenko, Hejinian, etc. as readings. Go figure. So I DO
think there is such a thing as a spottable AWP type, but then you have
Forche', and my boss is all ga-ga about this article we just got from
Clayton Eshleman. And we have an interview with Anne Waldman ready to go
to press. So you never know.

yeah, you know, i think it's too easy to make assumptions that people who have a
certain style and orientation in their own writing are hostile or unconscious
to/of others' rather than appreciative --and of course, as in the cap-l list and
in my dept it's sometimes true --but, for example, my writing has never treated
the "language" poets or oral-tradition poets (w/ possible exception of antin and
kaufman), but i dig them the mostest. --md

Joy's OK. People in the southwest mention her a lot, whether they are AWP
types or not. Have you heard her with band, Poetic Justice? Not really my
cup of tea, but she's a friend, and I hate to see her used as an icon in
this way. But then I guess we're all fair game.

   Thanks to Herb, Maria, Gwyn and Charles for there insights on "AWP"
    of course--if we want to prevent this discussion from lapsing into
    mere abstractions concerning "balance" and "reconciliation" (to
    export Coleridge's terms on "organic form") of poet factions, the
    issue is not just whether Forche is okay and acceptable because she
    teaches SUN & MOON people, but the challenges such an aesthetic these
    poets (i should say "these poets" because my formulation is, OF COURSE,
    vague at present) practice may raise and/or pose...
    LIKE AWP, APR has shown an openness to certain avant-gardists--
    Schwerner, Howe (though i don't think Fanny), Scalapino, and Shapiro
    have all been on cover, and someone once told me of Duncan's double
    standard (It's okay if *I* read beryyman, but young poets shouldn't)
    and I am reminded of Ashbery's assertion of O'hara as "too straight
    for the hips and too hip for the straights"--and perhaps I am just
    speaking about a fruitiful (fructifying?) aporia that exists in
    the MAPPING of any sense of poetry---If there are "two kinds of
    people"--those who prefer to work within what may be called a single
    style, or ideology, and whose sense of "community" becomes rigidified
    (either because of "early success" or because of "habit, the great
     deadener" or because of genuine commitment a la Watten's "my
     imagination locked into place during the vietnam war") and, on the
     other hand, those who prefer "the freedom of the poet" despite all
     the ideological markers that always reinscribe a certain "stance",
     can we say that these "two types of poets" exist in each of us,
     in a way LIKE CHARACTERS (as, for instance, the debate in Perelman's
     FIRST WORLD between "leftwing playgrounds" and "rightwing communic-
     ation centers"---I don't have the book handy now, that's a paraphrase)--
     and that "difference between" can't help but be "difference within?"
     And what good would such a distinction make? Well, I think it
     would encourage at least a certain re-opening to things one may
     have dismissed out of fear of being swamped by infinity....
     For I witnessed a panel discussion with Creeley and Forche on it
     (I've written about it elsewhere if anyone wants a copy) last fall
     and found myself often siding with Forche against Creeley---
     just as I find sometimes the "personal anecdote" of a James Tate
     more valuable by being put in dialogue with, say, Harryman or
     others. To find connections where they are not often said to be
     probably also implies its inverse (that "claims of lineage" are
     often done for ingenuous reasons)....okay, enough----

In the aftermath of the June 4th commemmoration, the April Fifth Action,
Hong Kong, would like to make an appeal to the international community to
denounce the assaults made by the Chinese Government against political
activists, especially the workers, in China.
 
The activists in China have put up a beroic fight in the last couple of
months. There have been workers protests, petitions and press conferences.
These are signs that the Chinese Democracy Movement has made important
progress since the June 4th crackdown six years ago.
 
Because of this, the Chinese Government has stepped up its repressions, for
fear that the Movement might present a serious threat when social discontent
and unrest have been building up for the last two to three years. Dozens of
organisers have already been arrested in the past few months, among whom are
Wei Jin-sang, Wong Dan, Lau Nin-chun and Chan Chi-ming, just to name a few
prominent ones.
 
The Chinese Government has been especially brutal to workers who organise
union activities. Three workers in Shencheng, just across the border of Hong
Kong, were arrested last year for organising unions and distributing
handbills. Unconfirmed reports said that they were sentenced to long prison
terms.
 
Here are some information about the 3 organizers arrested in ShenZeng:
 
1. Li Wen-ming and Kuo Le-zhuang, Male, Han race, both from Hunan Province
(in the middle of China, along the Yangtze River), about 27 years old.
 
2. Li was trained at a Hunan technical college (not sure which department).
In his school years, he had already participated in the local student
movement. After his graduation, he was assigned to a factory to work. In
1991, he resigned and went to ShenZeng and got a job as the public relation
officer of the magazine "Youth of ShenZeng". At the end of 92, he went to
Beijing University to study and associated with democracy activists there.
 
3. Kuo Le-zhuang studied in the Shanghai Transport University and was active
in the student movement, bding a student leader of the university during the
86-87 student unrest. In a meeting with the then Shanghai Mayor, Jiang Zemin
(now the President of china), Kuo critized Jiang harshly and thus won the
respect of the students. When the student unrest was over, he was dismissed
and went back to the countryside. In 1993, Li Wen-ming invited him to go to
ShenZeng to do organizing work.
 
4. In June, 1993, Li and Kuo initiated a program to educate the workers
about the poor labour conditions in the numerous factories in ShenZeng. In
August, they started a Workers' Evening School, which attracted hundreds of
workers to attend the courses. Then they planned to establish an independent
trade union called the "Union of Labourers". (In China, independent trade
unions are not allowed. There is only one union-the Official Trade Union
controlled by the CCP).
 
5. In September, 1993, the ShenZeng Public Security Bureau took away some
documents from their office. In October, under pressure from the PSB, they
fled to Beijing. Then at the beginning of 94, both of them came back to
start again..
 
6. In April, 1994, the PSB arrested them. To date, they are still detained
incommunicado, with no charges pressed against them.
 
7. There are about a dozen core activists involved in the project. Two of
them are Guo Bao-sheng, a student of the Chinese Poeple's University
(Beijing) and Li Ming-qi of Beijing University. Both were dismissed for
political reasons (that means they deviated from the party line and
harboured 'libral' ideas). Guo was arrested at the same time with Li and Kuo
while Li Ming-qi's whereabout has been unknown from then.
 
 
****************************************************************************
************
We appeal to you all to send protest messages to the Chinese Government to
demand for the release of these activists who had done nothing but to
exercise the freedom of speech and the right to associate.
 
Please send protest letters or messages to the Standing Committee, National
Poeples' Congress, Beijing, China.
 
We would very much appreciate if you can pass the message to other labour
organisations.

Subject:      Tong Yi Urgent Action (fwd)
 
URGENT ACTION ALERT: TONG YI
July 15, 1995
 
     Human Rights in China (HRIC) has learned that on the morning
of July 13, 1995 two police officers visited the parents of
political prisoner Tong Yi to inform them that: 1. Due to the
fact that Tong Yi has been uncooperative in completing her labor
production quotas since her arrival at the Hewan Reeducation
Through Labor Camp in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in January
1995, she would be transferred to the Shayang Reeducation Though
Labor Farm in Hubei province (the largest such camp in the
country) where prison authorities would use "forceful measures"
to make her obey; 2. Her mother would no longer be allowed to
visit her because Tong Yi becomes too despondent and unruly
following her monthly visits.
     HRIC also has reliable information that Tong Yi has already
been beaten with police batons by police guards in the labor
camp.
     HRIC is extremely concerned the "forceful measures" referred
to will involve physical punishment administered by the labor
camp authorities or other prisoners ordered to do so.  HRIC
considers Tong Yi a prisoner of conscience who is in immediate
physical danger and calls on the international community
including the UN Committee Against Torture and the UN Working
Group on Arbitrary Detention to demand for the immediate and
unconditional release of Tong Yi.  [See below for addresses
individuals can write to calling for her release.]
 
     Tong Yi, 27, was the former assistant and translator for
China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, until her detention
in April 1994 after informing foreign reporters about Wei's April
1, 1994 detention.  On December 22, 1994, Tong was sentenced
without trial to a two-and-a-half year Reeducation Through Labor
term.  She was sentenced under Article 10 (4) of the 1982 "Trial
Implementation Methods for Reeducation Through Labor" which
allows for the detention of individuals for up to three years
without charge or trial for activities deemed to "disturb public
order."  Although the detention order did not specify what crime
she was accused of, Tong Yi's only "crime" appears to be her
association with Wei Jingsheng.
     Since her sentencing, Tong has been working 12-hour days in
a textile workshop at the Hewan Reeducation Camp near her home in
Wuhan, Hubei Province.  In a letter smuggled out to her mother,
Tong Yi described being beaten on January 16, 1995 by two camp
 
 
 
 
 
inmates working as "trusties" assigned to assist the prison
guards in keeping order.  The beating occurred after Tong refused
to work more than the eight hours per day stipulated by state
regulations and complained about expectations that prisoners in
the camp work until 10 p.m. or later to fulfill their production
quotas.  Tong asked camp officials for protection but was beaten
the following day by more than ten fellow women prisoners.  Her
face and body were reportedly swollen and covered with bruises.
In her letter, Tong Yi stated that she would work only eight
hours, "even if they beat me to death."  The letter also claimed
that her written appeals against the inhumane conditions in the
camp were repeatedly stolen or confiscated.
     Tong studied political science at the University of
Political Science and Law in Beijing.  She was active in the 1989
democracy movement on Tiananmen Square as part of the Student
Dialogue Delegation and as a result was forced to leave the
university befo graduating.  She then worked with the dissident
intellectual Cao Siyuan and translated China's Crisis into
Chinese.  The book, by Columbia University professor Andrew
Nathan, examines the impact of the Beijing Massacre on the
legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party.
     Tong became an assistant for Wei Jingsheng upon his release
from a 14-and-a-half year imprisonment in September 1993. For the
following seven months she acted as a liaison between Wei and
foreign diplomats and journalists. Tong Yi had been accepted to
Columbia University for a master's program in political science,
and upon her arrest Columbia President George Rupp made a direct
appeal for her release.
-------------------------------------------------------
Write to the Chinese authorities and make them aware that you
know about Tong Yi's situation and demand that she be released
immediately or at least be allowed access to a lawyer of her
choice to appeal her case in accordance with Chinese law.

To all:
 
        The creative writing program at the University of Hawai'i does
not advertise for its Visiting Distinguished Writers (as they are
called), but it is possible to express interest in being one by writing
to Prof. Robbie Shapard, Dept of English, 1733 Donaghho Road, U of
Hawai'i, Honolulu, HI 96822.  The positions are for one semester, and I
have no idea what they pay (the going rate, I suspect).  Because the
process has been so mysterious, the writers have tended to be of a kind,
which hasn't been so much a bad thing, as a predictable one.  I, for one,
would love to see people on this list apply.  If anyone wants more
information, I can muster it up.

Being as I'm here--Oh, please please please someone on this list apply!!
That would be wicked pissa!

hi lindz,
 
one book I've read on Beardsley and his work in the context of a grotesque
tradition in european art-- reaching back to greco-roman antiquity and
forward to Bakhtin and "perverse erotics" -- is Ewa Kuryluk's Salome and
Judas in the Cave of Sex: The Grotesque-- Origins, Iconography, Techniques.
From Northwestern University Press, 1987. Many great illustrations from
Beardsley and others, too.

I for one am suspicious of any attempt to correlate wretchedness with
whack-off rate (damn near a critical myth in the case of Larkin).  ;-)
Let's find other causes for Larkin's asinine character, please.

Subject: "Marketing strategies"
 
 
I was interested by a post forwarded to me about "marketing strategies"
for concurrent poetic styles, which leads to the following connected
series of questions:
 
(1) Is the purpose of the POETICS list to have a go at changing
subscribers' thinking on questions of poetics, or simply to send a message
pleasing to the speaker even if not designed or destined to change
anyone's thinking?
 
(2) If the latter, then why not just skip the list and send it to oneself
alone?
 
(3) If the purpose is to change subscribers' thinking, then why not
present the sender's thinking on a particular style or poetry?
 
(4) Given how revealing metaphors are, which of the following metaphors
best describes the process of changing the thinking of another person?
 
        a.  The lighting of one candle from another.
 
        b.  Selling, and the marketing strategies behind selling.
 
        c.  Infection--the propagation of a microbe or virus.
 
        d.  Coercion, the marshaling of intellectual troops to enforce
correct thinking.
 
        e.  Seduction--attraction, effective endearments and caresses,
leading to surrender.
 
        f.  Inebriation--conveyance of intellectual substances which
erode resistance or blur argument.
 
        g.  Terrorism--dropping a bomb and taking advantage of the
resulting fear and confusion to assume control.
 
        h.  A sermon leading to conversion
 
        i.  The banquet--setting out a dinner and declaring "Open House."
 
 
 
(5)  Are there other metaphors that describe the process?
 
(6) Have there been instances of subscribers' changing their
thinking on the basis of posts on POETICS?  If so, how did it happen?

  I'm readng Alfred Corn's posting to POETICS and wondering who it was
  a response to--perhaps Rachel...or maybe Herb Levy--though Levy's
  lengthy post did not really suggest "changing people's minds" so maybe
  that idea was a Corn intepolation. It sees to me that herb was less
  interested in changing people's minds than he was in wanting people to
  come out of the closet a little me and be willing to "define" themselves.
  But maybe that's a misreading too. As for myself, I'd like to see more
  of a attempt at such "definition" but I don't think a discussion of the
  work of somebody on the list would necessarily work---(esp. when there's
  a thread around still called "Jerry Garcia" which has nothing to say
  about its ostensible subject but "nifty" swear words)---in parts because
  then the list becomes subordinated to the published body of someone's
  work---for me, one of the values of the list is that to some extent it's
  AN ESCAPE from that, a possibility for a different mode of dialogue than
  "poetry" and "essay writing"--i still have some kind of faith in the
  possibility of "organic" "improvisation" or something among the rengas...
  And the possibilities of ISSUES that have come up here (such as metaphor,
  the self/the soul,and others) seems more fruitful than bringing egos
  into it too much by discussing the work of a "big name" or career level
  ( i meant "mid-career level"--mandel's term) or unknown poet----
  Jordan Davis asked this question of what do we want to happen on this
  list awhile ago, and it's still an open question...I'm on a SHAKESPEARE
  list and though the arguments there are not so much analogous to the ones
  here (I.e.--not a matter of JONSON vs. SHAKESPEARE like OLSON vs. O'HARA)
  but there is HUGE division about critical approaches and/or temperaments
  (IF anyone still believes in that), and it's handeld for the most part
  very gracefully--..and maybe in the POETICS world "candor" is nothing
  but the title of a book by alan davies (though maria damon and others
  have been quite candid), and maybe this is due to fear of alienating
  potential supporters---I keep thinking of that thing in Midsummer Night's
  Dream where the actors are afraid that roaring like a lion will scare
  the audience...when of course even a VERY GOOD actor can not convincingly
  roar like a lion enough to scare, let alone THEM! (us)--or the dylan
  line about "the one who tries to hide what it don't know to begin with"--
  And, MAYBE MAYBE dear Alfred Corn I'm just loving to hear myself speak--
  (and this has gone on long even for me--but what the hell---) but since
  I don't always believe you have to try to change someon's mind in order
  not to "just hear yourself speak" it may be something else.....
                                       sloppily yours (unwinding),
 
                     chris s.

Mostly a lurker, the list lubricates me, usually early in the morning, with

I "change my thinking" every three thousand miles, or every three months,

Subject:      Re: Larkin fucks again
Comments: To: POETICS@edu.buffalo.cc.UBVM
 
Larkin also wrote poems that commit to memory, viz the following, from
my own memory
 
        They fuck you up, your mum and dad.
        They may not mean to but they do.
        They hand on all the faults they had
        And add some new ones, just for you.
 
        But they were fucked up, in their turn,
        By fools in old-style hats and coats
        Who half the time were soppy-stern
        And half at one another's throats.
 
        Man hands on misery to man.
        It deepens like a coastal shelf.
        Get out as early as you can,
        And don't have any kids yourself.
 
This poem seems to me no less mordant and bitter than a Kurt Cobain lyric,
yet I doubt he'll get called the names Larkin's getting called, though
both have a talent we may mock but may envy of memorability, a whole
piece staying in the mind, not necessarily because of an "internal logic"
such as Ron has brilliantly analysed in The New Sentence, but sometimes
wedding odd curiously-phrased line or noticed detail to each other, by
the power of knowing and feeling for an oral form committable to memory.
        Plus, the use of the word "fuck" in this poem expertly connects
with the other uses of the word "fuck" in Larkin's small oeuvre, to
demonstrate a man in some ways blunted as a child and dealing with adults
and lovers in a trapped and unsensuous way because he has been made into
a rhythm; this is not to say he treated his lovers, or those he came into
contact with at Hull University Library, with brutality; it seems the
fact of his biography that he was gentle and polite with them (though
self-indulgent and morose with - often stupid - literary admirers), yet
could not enjoy this gentle rhythm, felt it always to be an act. This
still allows us a distinction between what his poems and letters may
reveal of an inner life, a brutal despair, a racism (expressed privately
and never mounted as a public act, such as refusing someone service or
employment - a racism of which many writers who never write racism happen
to practice) and how he acted. For Larkin's lovers there was such a
thing as a caress, for him it was unenjoyable, terrifying, not a fuck.
        It seems to me that Clark Coolidge can do a terrific explosion
of the word fuck in his _Book of During_, yet in the end it remains less
interesting than Larkin's use of it, or just as. I get as annoyed reading
unbacked-up sniping at Larkin as others do hearing people be snobby about
pop music - is one saying that Larkin was wicked, that Larkin readers are
wicked, that it's corrupting, or what? Why either Larkin or Language
Poetry? Why not both?

because I edited the thing. It is the all-Canuck issue. The next
issue is ed. by Peter Quartermain, and is the Brit issue. This one
just out has terrific bpNichol stuff, Erin Moure, section on Roy
Kiyooka, a weird series from Native woman named J.B.Joe, etc.
Best intro to CanLit I can imagine.

I'd always heard that AWP stood for Average White Poets, although around
the office it's usually Associated Weird Problems.
 
 
Gwyn,

Thanks for the thanks, but I don't even know what AWP is, so if I talked
about it, it was by accident.

Nope, Ozzie Smith never played for the Giants. But he did play in
