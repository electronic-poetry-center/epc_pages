Greetings from a formerly silent lurker! 
  
With the indulgence of the list, I would like to revive the question of   
the political content of poetic form, implicitly continuing a discussion  
which arose at an MLA session called "Poetry: The Visual Dimension." Alan 
Golding gave a helpful paper about Susan Howe's visual poetics, and during the
Q&A, Marjorie Perloff asked "the big skeptical question" (I wish I could  
remember her exact words!), wondering about the connection between the 
disruption for instance of the linear form of the poem on the page and 
the disruption of patriarchy. And Bob Perelman accelerated the question by  
raising the specter of the "history of the avant-garde."  
  
Since then I have been wondering why poetry can't be construed as having  
political potential in a metaphoric mode.  It seems to me that metaphors  
(whether formal or more simply rhetorical) not only express but also 
potentially restage political issues (as in for instance the work of 
Medbh McGuckian) in educational ways.  When Mina Loy chose an open form for 
her notorious 1915-17 "Love Songs" (THE best since Sappho, she called them) 
the rhetoric of form and content immediately sent critics into a delirium of  
invective against free women, free verse, free love... in other words critics 
got the point before they "got" the poems, a situation which recurs every day 
in the poetry classroom where students and teachers can usefully confront 
prejudices in the guise of aesthetic questions.   
  
Ten years ago I wrote an ill-thought-out essay about T.S. Eliot which  
earned me a 'D' from Kathryne Lindberg and caused this student (from a deeply 
traditional and right-wing family) to attend consciously to the question for  
the very first time. Although it now may sound nostalgic to say so,  
Williams and Olson (also on the syllabus) helped me out...and so did 
Kathryne, with a magnum of patience...   
  
Language: the parent, not the child of thought? (Wilde) 
  
With gratitude for all of you poetic teachers,

 Dear Marisa-- 
 Thank you for the insight you bring to the issues of "metaphor" and 
 its "antagonism" towards allegedly more "forward-looking" poetic  
 disjunction. I believe the extent to which these issues have been 
 "gendered" by the current dominant poetic factions is highly problematic 
 for it's quite possible that what's called 'reactionary' and therefore 
 patriarchal by a certain avant-garde strain (what's derided as "metaphor"  
 or "symbolist" or even "Romantic") has been dismissed out of hand.  
 If we look at it historically, one can see the rhetoric that has enabled 
 the legitimation of so-called "nonmetaphoric" or "nonlinear" modes of  
 poetry has, for all its claims of radical politicalization, too often  
 played into the demands and dynamics of the "academic establishment."  
 (This reminds me of the statement--"Derrida would not have ever been   
  allowed into the academy were it not for the fact that it's extremely 
  easy to read Shakespeare as such."). 
 In the academic fashion-show, the notion that women (or other 'marginalized' 
 groups) must reject anything that reeks of tradition, seems to be either 
 (1) self-defeating or (2) a desperate attempt to justify the so-called 
 'new' poetry, a poetry which has now come to have its own share of investment
 not so much a matter of "which side are you on" or even "taste," but a matter
 not so much a matter of "which side are you on" or even "taste," but a matter
 and "form" is problematized. The fact is, the debate between "metaphor"  
 and "nonmetaphor" based poetry, between minimalism and maximalism, between 
 meaning and play, cuts across political lines. To the extent that debates  
 over poetry center on the POLITICS OF FORM obscures a perhaps more serious 
 issue. For if the great "Western Canon" is a repressive force that needs 
 to be subverted, perhaps this can best be done so by entering into dialogue  
 with it. Though we should be aware of the repressive partriachal capitalistic
 cases supported the so-called "alternative" as well. This is not to say that 
 there aren't writers on both "sides" that ARE more politically subverive than
 certain formal code. Any more thoughts you have on this would be appreciated.
  Thanx, Chris Stroffolino

Here are three more JOURNAL contributions to the discussion about the  
marginalization of poetry within the academy.  
  
The original query to this thread also posed the open call for   
more discussion of poetry on this list (as does Tony Petrosky at the

Subj: RE: JRNL: Poetry on the Margins  
  
I just read the responses to the original posting.  It's curious, I  
think, to see them as a cross section of responses, taking, as they do,   
various positions that it seems to me I have heard in my department at 
one time or the other.  They all seem legitimate, serious, but in an odd  
way they would all, including mine, put off people for various reasons.   
Maybe it is that there is this atmosphere of critique dominating our 
reading and writing.  I think of something Robert Creeley once said to a  
seminar I was in in graduate school:  "you're all here because poetry is  
plastic, it's something you can do anything in."  I think he meant that   
it is an open form, a place where traditions can dominate and invention   
can dominate and the mix of what happens will always, then, contain the   
tensions that arise from differences.  Formalists disparage language 
poets, language poets disparage narrative poets, abstract expressionists  
like Louise Gluck disparage so called confessional poets like Sharon 
Olds.  The differences create defense, posture.  Now that seems similar   
to just about anything I can think of that allows difference, and the  
tensions get hightened, I think, we layer on to the scene the interests   
and motives of those who don't write poetry or teach it but critique it   
from various perspectives.  So, yeah it seems, as one of the respondents  
put it, there are a lot of reasons why it is on the margins.  
  
But why wouldn't it be possible to take as a project the reading and 
writing of radically different kinds of poetry:  Sharon Olds next to 
Ashbery next to Rumi next to Gluck next to Bernstein?  Why not let poetry 
of all sorts exist in the same space and ask students, then, to work on   
understanding it.  We could give them traditions to use to frame the 
discussions.  We could give them at least a sense of difference and a  
place to both respect it (as those who participate by writing the  
different kinds of poems do) and work on it.  These are the kinds of 
solutions I am interested in.  What we can do to bring our students to 
poetry. 
  
It seems to me that we could make a huge catalogue of reasons why poetry  
is in the supposed state we think it is.  But that is then a big 
complaint.  Is that a good place for the energy?  Maybe to point we can   
understand the situation of poetry this way, but I suspect the situation  
varies by location.  Bucknell University, for instance, takes poetry 
seriously for undergraduates with its visiting poets every year, its 
Poetry Festival, its literary magazines, and its undergraduate   
workshops.  Other places don't do anything near that, but at Pitt, for 
example, we put a tremendous emphasis on graduate work in poetry.  Still  
other place do so also but with an emphasis on a different kind of 
poetry.  So we learn from this kind of generalized talk, I'd say, that 
the situation of poetry is not uniform.  Ok.  So now what?  
  
I'd love to continue the discussion of teaching poetry in various places  
in the curriculum.  Rumi and LaLa and Kabir in religious studies along 
with Blake and Hopkins along with A. Rich and Phil Levine.  Poetry in  
composition studies.  Multi-genre writings that include poetry.  
Traditions of poetry juxtaposed against other traditions.  Any takers?

Subj: RE:  JRNL: Poetry on the Margins 
  
I would like to chip in regarding reactions to poetry.  I, too, find 
that even in academe, poetry is viewed with some trepidation or perhaps   
the notion that it's somehow old-fashioned, that the hot stuff is going   
on in fiction these days?  And certainly many students are petrified of   
poetry, or think it will bore them to tears. 
  
 But the good news is, I have to agree with several other posters who  
noted having good success teaching poetry, even (or especially?) in  
composition classes, especially contemporary, more life-based works.  I,  
too, have had this experience.  I taught a section on poetry and writing  
about poetry in a composition class at a community college--mostly to  
students who had had very little previous exposure to poetry and whose 
discomfort level with the subject was high.  I chose a  range, from  
Robert Frost and Shakespearean sonnets to Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn 
Brooks, Sharon Olds, Gary Soto, and other contemporary writers.  I 
brought in a record of poets reading their works--they heard Hughes and   
Brooks, as I recall.  I tried not to overwhelm them; I wanted them to  
read each poem several times and pay attention to the language.  I 
modeled this kind of reading in class and assigend them only a few poems  
at a time to read, though I encouraged them to browse further!  Finally,  
I had students working in pairs or small groups give their reading of  
the poem to the class, ie make a presentation about what they had gotten  
out of the poem, what particular problems they encountered, how they 
came to some understanding with it. 
  
I found this portion of the class quite successful; several students 
came up to me and told me how they'd never known poetry could be so  
interesting, or that they could make sense of it, etc.  The students 
also wrote a paper comparing several poems that dealt with the same  
theme, comparing and contrasting the poems' differing approaches to the   
theme in terms of language, imagery, tone, etc.

Re poetry: You know, it depends somewhat on where you look.  I don't have 
the sense (and I could easily be wrong) that poetry is marginalized in 
courses that focus on contemporary women writers or on Chicano/a 
writers, for example.  
  I also think that while Carter Revard's funny account is true in  
essence, there have always been countertraditions to the deliberately  
complex and obscure modernism represented by Eliot, et al.  Think of 
Sterling Brown and Langston Hughes, Amy Lowell, Frost, and many of the 
poets Cary Nelson discusses in REPRESSION AND RECOVERY. 
  Part of the problem has, I think, to do with the struggle of the  
academic community to free itself from the still hegemonic New Critical   
pedagogical tradition, which was, after all, constructed by folks like 
Ransom, Tate, and Brooks, with predecessors like Eliot very much in  
mind.

Subject:  Poetry on the Margins of What? 
  
Both Tony Petrovsky and Paul Lauter's comments reflect quite clearly 
some very different ideas of what might be meant by the proposition  
"poetry is at the margins."I don't know Tony but given Paul's long 
involvement with bringing radical politics to the academy, it's  
interesting how inherently non-market oriented each approach seems to  
be. 
  
The idea that poetry "is at the margins" of course proposes some spatial  
model of something, with an identifiable center from which poetry could   
then be distant. What is that thing? Books sold? Cultural influence? 
Fame? Petrovsky speculates that the diversity of poetic subcultures in 
our society might be causal (rather than, say, a reflection or   
manifestation of some larger social process). Paul gets in a gratuitous   
(and completely reductive) slap at the avant-garde tradition (w/o  
recognizing it as the only *international* literary tradition the world   
has ever had). Its role in identitarian political movements is then  
posed as a truer center.  
  
That reminded me of the condition that poets found themselves in the 
former Soviet Union (FSU). For a long time, almost 30 years, poets held   
a critical social function for political opposition. Since political 
meetings were verboten, poetry readings often took on the role of a  
public rally. Audiences were large. But it is not evident that this  
benefited more than a handful of individual poets and its impact on  
writing per se seems to have been quite a mixed bag.  
  
Once a broader terrain of discourse was possible, the necessity of the 
poet as a symbol of resistance quickly disappeared. Audiences shrunk 
rapidly and the new market economy of Russia and the other republics has  
meant that the next generation of poets over there will probably be no 
more well distributed and read than their contemporaries here.   
  
Jan Clausen, a poet and novelist who has long been involved with lesbian  
poetics and politics (until she married a man a couple of years ago, but  
that's another story), wrote an excellent pamphlet on this subject 
called *A Movement of Poets: Thoughts on Poetry and Feminism* (Brooklyn:  
Long Haul Press, 1982). She is generally very suspicious of the impact 
of each on the other. For example, writing of poetry's decline as a  
leading force for feminism once second-wave feminism created its own 
institutions, she notes:  
  
"Ironically, I suspect that poetry as a genre has lost prestige within 
the women's movement for the same reason that fiction lacked it in 
nineteenth century patriarchal England--because it is perceived as 
something almost anyone can do. That is the hidden meaning of a code 
phrase like 'there's so much feminist poetry,' and it points to the  
hypocrisy of the general feminist rejection of critical standards; 
rather than apply them, we have sometimes simply stopped paying  
attention to poetry at all." (pp. 46-7)  
  
If Clausen suggests the logical end result of the kind of reductivism  
that Lauter's comments exhibit, Petrovsky's variation of Teach the 
Conflicts seems equally problematic. I personally would prefer to have a  
new formalist who was both passionate and knowledgeable about that 
tendency to teach a lit course than a liberal who sees Sharon Olds and 
Bruce Andrews as points of equal interest on an undifferentiated plane.   
To have any value at all, the "teach the conflicts" approach requres the  
instructor to have (and argue) a theory of organization and history that  
positions every text and author.  
  
Both Lauter and Petrovsky presume (reasonably enough for a Teaching of 
American Lit discussion group) a defining privilege for the classroom in  
determining the answer to the question. Needless to say, I have my 
doubts there. 
  
So I keep coming up against the problem of the Margins of What. Walt 
Whitman self-published the first edition of Leaves of Grass. Much of 
Stein's work came out the same way. George Oppen's To Press, which 
Williams and Zukofsky hoped would be the vehicle to bring the 
objectivists to a larger audience, was just one more tiny press. As  
Charles Bernstein and others have pointed out (repeatedly, I must say),   
the problem of poetry's distribution to The Masses has changed very  
little in the past 200 years. What has changed, it seems to me, is the 
set of assumptions we making about what is central in public discourse,   
i.e., what is a center? Where is it and who defines it? Is Bill Moyers 
fawning over Donald Hall or Robert Bly an example of the potential 
success of poetry? Or quite the opposite?  
  
What has changed, beyond the ongoing revolution in media (I'm old enough  
to remember the paperback as the exception, not the rule), has been an 
articulation of communities of writing. There may well be 300+ poets 
working in, or more or less directly from, what has been called Language  
Poetry. And publishing. Plus another 300 to 500 coming out of other  
variants of the New American tradition of 50s and 60s. And as 
Petrovsky notes in his comment of Gluck's attitude towards Olds, the 
establishmentarian tradition in American Lit is as well articulated. All  
of these discussions of the decenteredness or marginality of poetry  
seems to me to give very short shrift to very real communities,  
communities that are ultimately very different from the ones that Lauter  
imagines (precisely because they derive from lived experience of daily 
contact rather than application to some ideal of race, gender or 
nationality). Then the question of the marginality of any community  
would be one directly of its role within the larger society, poetry  
being the symptom more than the cause.   
  
No? 
  
As Lee Ann Brown,  
the quintessential "NY School" poet of her generation 
might say,  
"Happy New Year, y'all."

I just wanted to clarify one thing for Marina Januzzi.  At that MLA  
session, I did not mean to imply that the choice of form does not have 
ideological implications, just that "disruption" of form is a complex matter  
that has to refer to more than breaking up a page--that is, there are  
breaks and breaks.  I suppose I think each example has to be judged on 
its own merits--and, yes, the "metaphoric mode" may be just as   
"disruptive" depending.  I actually thought Alan Golding's paper was 
terrific; it's just that all day I had been hearing someone or other say  
about whatever poems by women that they oppose patriarchy etc, by such things 
as typography and my sense is that there are often things said (not by Alan 
but by others) that could apply equally well to a very conventional male  
poet--say Ted Hughes--just as well so we have to be careful, that's all.  
Hope this clarifies...

There was an eleventh-century _Domesday Book_ that represents the

important text for medieval studies, since it includes much of

I'm not clear whether there's an etymological connection between

I've just read your earlier query about the work of Armand Schwerner

two years ago, I haven't read enough of his work to comment personally.   
  
But I've been editing a two-volume set on contemporary poets for the 
_Dictionary of Literary Biography_, and I "commissioned" an entry on 
Schwerner by a critic namer Arthur J. Sabatini.  He sent me an excellent  
5000 word essay, with a full critical bibliography, that includes discussion

Hello everyone-- 
  
To Marjorie Perloff:  thank you for the clarification; it's pretty much   
what I imagined you might say, and I'd guess we attended many of the same 
panels.  In any case I understood the spirit of the question. And by the  
way, *Compliments*, Alan Golding, if you're out there, on your Susan Howe 
piece.  Will you be publishing it?  
  
Chris Stroffolino raises the interesting issue of the weird devaluation   
of metaphor in contemporary theory if not poetry.  I remember having a 
pretty harsh discussion with someone who was trying to get me to admit 
that metonymy was preferable, ethically, to metaphor, which seemed 
authoritarian as a mode of discourse... but what ever happened to the  
surrealist potential for metaphor (the chance encounter described by 
Lautreamont)? 
  
Also, can anyone recommend readings on this huge subject of the  
political content of poetic form? (i.e. best-case formulations of the  
question)? I throw it open like this because I'm curious if there are  
particular texts which you-- any of you-- mentally stand by when these 
questions come up. 
  
Yours in the midst of sleepy weather,

AMERICA: A PRAYER  
  
The Honorable Newt Gingrich has informed us that prayer in the public  
schools is one of the most important issues facing this great nation, and 
in our firm belief that America doesn't have a prayer, we call upon The   
Poets of America to accept their intellectual responsibility to give 
America a prayer. Opportunity is crucial in a capitalist society. We feel 
therefore that this, the 104th Congress, should have the opportunity to   
authorize the production of the appropriate American prayer from amongst  
the deeply felt works of America's finest, most challenging, and 
dedicated writers. 
  
America's prayer is meant to be read by everybody, but don't let that  
stop you. Your prayers should be 500 words or less. Please send two  
copies of your prayer, one marked "Proposal for Prayer for the Schools"   
to The Honorable Newt Gingrich, House of Representatives, 2428 Rayburn 
House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515. Send your other copy with  
self-addressed stamped envelope to Aerial/Edge at the address below. No   
strictures on style or content. Writers may or may not wish to imagine 
delivery of their prayer in a classroom context. You do not have to be a  
U.S. citizen to participate. Also interested in visual materials. A  
selection of the prayers will be published in The New Censorship 
(Denver). Other editors interested in this project should contact us.  
Please pass this opportunity on to as many people as possible.   
  
Deadline: Feb 28, 1995.

Some Schwerner dope: Station Hill Press brought out Tablets I-XXIV in 1983, in  
a volume together with a collection of shorter poems called "sounds of the  
river Naranjana."Then Altas Press, London, brought out in '89 I-XXIV plus new 
XXV and XXVI -- the latter, much longer than any of the earlier ones, is par- 
ticularly astonishing.  XXVI is the last I've been able to locate; until I've 
checked with Schwerner himself, I'm assuming it's the last -- unless someone  
out there knows otherwise?  
  
I've come across catalogue entries for recordings of Schwerner reading from the 
Tablets, but haven't had a chance to listen to any yet.  I'm curious to know  
how he handles the visual dimension of the Tablets in performing them ... I 
think of them as really eye-oriented, page-bound texts, but perhaps that's a  
mistake...

indeed, that is a mistake, Schwerner is an absolutely first rate 
performer of the TABLETS -- they are among the wild-humourist poems it has  
ever been my pleasure to hear. Schwerner realizes the visual elements  
orally as interferences by the scholar-translator into the lyrical 
process of the poems & it is exactly in the oral realization of that 
tension, in the juxtaposition of those different levels of discourse,  
that one can get to the polysemic core of the work. Go & listen, 
you've got a major treat coming!

I'm currently looking at eight pages which are collectively presented as  
"from Tablet XXXVI," by Armand Schwerener, which were the latest addition 
to the journal NORTH AMERICAN IDEOPHONICS ANNUAL, a by-invitation  
assembling journal or series edited by Mark Nowak. The address is 908  
Franklin Terrace, 3rd floor, Minneapolis, MN  55406, USA, or by e-mail,   
manowak@alex.stkate.edu   
  
Since this journal was assembled only on Dec. 17, 1994, I assume that  
this is work is new and may be an addition to the Tablet XXVI published   
in London, and that it probably brings the work pretty much up to date,   
although I would, as others have, suggest going to Armand Schwerner to 
verify that.

Just to update my last post here, as I hadn't read my Schwerner pages for 
NORTH AMERICAN IDEOPHONICS ANNUAL yet, and they were given to me after 
the rest of the annual was assembled, an act with which I assisted. No,   
these are not eight pages, rather four copies of two pages. Some 
astonishing writing, nonetheless.

Tom-- 
  
One would have a hard time, since it's actually the Atlas Press--there was a  
typo in the original posting of that information. Anyway, The Tablets is  
distributed by SPD, along with a couple other of Armand's books. If for   
some reason that doesn't work, the press' London address is 10 Park Street, 
London SE1 9AB, England--but that's five years old. 
  
General inquiry: Does anyone have an e-address for Cole Swensen? I need to get
in touch with her.

I don't know who -- if anyone -- distributes it in this country, but 
you could write directly to:  
  
Aleister Botchie 
Atlas Press 
5 Ormond Mansions, flat 100A  
Southampton Row  
London WCI  
GB  
  
An excellent press, btw, with a range of interesting surrealist &  
post-surrealist titles.

Just had a look & sure enough SPD carries Atlas Press books, & there's Tablets  
I-XXVI listed among them.  Doesn't appear that the Station Hill Press edition 
is still in print, but the Tablets part of that would be superseded by the  
Atlas edition anyway.  
  
Alan Golding's note now makes me wish I'd gone to MLA & heard Schwerner rather  
than stay home to try & write about him!  Choices....

BTW, don't forget that the Living Theater in New York put on a production of  
The Tablets five or six or seven years ago. I was priveleged to have attended

their place on E. 3rd St, one of the first productions at that space.  
Unfortunately, they lost the space after a couple of years.

Hello folks,  
  
I'm wondering if it's too late to come up with a couple of  
readings/talks in the mid-Atlantic states at the end of May or even the   
very first few days of June? I've been asked by Alec Marsh to give a 
paper at the ALA in Baltimore (May 26-28) and would love to be able to 
say yes. But I need to come up w/ travel money to make it possible,  
since these scholarly meetings are run with the presumption that 
everyone who will attend comes with departmental funding (a 19th century  
concept of scholarship that should have died out in the 1930s with the 
rise of the public intellectual). 
  
I need to let Alec know by January 13, so let me know if you're sitting   
on unspent departmental reading $$.

how strange to contemplate.  I remember being in junior high school in 
the early sixties and going to see Jack Gelber's dope play The Connection 
at The Living Theatre (and feeling very hip); then all the terrifically   
weird stuff in the early seventies which I only heard about didn't see;   
and then The Tablets??? I guess I'd like to see a split stage,   
simultaneous staging of The Connection and The Tablets (a la Ashbery's 
"As We Know"?).  Not really now; just a Theatrical Mind Boggler Koan....  
happy new year all

We are pleased to announce two new EPC features:  
  
(Gopher and Web versions) 
A "search" feature has been designed to probe through the Poetics  
backfiles for you. You may now search the entire corpus by keyword.  
(The results screen will list documents containing your keyword. You 
then may open documents individually and search for the occurrence of  
the keyword. In most systems this would be /keyword, where "keyword" 
is your search term.) Now you can pinpoint that elusive phrase...  
  
(Web version only) A "hotlist" has been added to most "major" levels 
of the web version.  This means that from any point in the Web you can 
select "hotlist" and move with great facility to numerous key spots in 
the EPC web. This feature will pretty much place you within two  
keystrokes of most menus, making the EPC web much more quickly   
navigated.

I learned of the Poetics list from a reference to it on the T-Amlit list, 
and would like very much to subscribe. Could you please either send me 
the appropriate address to subscribe, or add me to the list? Thank you 
very much for your assistance.

Dear Poetry List,  
  
In response to Ron's posting abt the upcoming Senate floor  
vote, I sent a query to Jim Warren. Warren runs a mailing 
list called GovAccess. If he has a list of all Congressional  
e-mail addresses, or an address where such a list can be  
obtained, I'll post it.   
  
Warren's mailing list is pretty interesting. It's not 
published often so if your e-mailbox is already full every  
morning, this won't add much. Here is the subscription info:  
  
To join the GovAccess list, email a request to 
jwarren@well.sf.ca.us .

I would like to subscribe to the poetics list.  I saw a posting from this 
list cross-posted to another list I'm on, Teaching American Literature

I'm not getting in the way by using the wrong method. 
Thanks and, if needed, apologies.

Item 625  06-JAN-95  17:25  American Arts Alliance  
1-900 Emergency Number in Place 
  
  
  January 6, 1995 
  
Dear Arts Advocates: 
  
  As you know, since the November elections the future of our  
national cultural agencies, including the National Endowment for 
the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the 
Institute for Museum Services, is seriously threatened.  These   
agencies are facing severe cuts to their current funding or 
possible elimination.  Arts advocates across the country must act  
NOW if these agencies are to be saved.   
  
  The Emergency Committee to Save Culture and the Arts, a 
project of the American Arts Alliance, has set up a 1-900 number 
(it is already working!) so that arts groups, artists,  
volunteers, arts patrons, audience members, contributors, local  
businesses, vendors and suppliers can quickly and easily register  
their support for continued funding for the arts and culture with  
their members of Congress, for a nominal fee.  Time is short. You  
are invited to use this number immediately.  
  
  When you can call this number, 1-900-370-9000, the following 
will happen:  
  
1.) The caller will be handled by a live operator.  Following a  
  brief statement that the call costs $1.99 per minute and   
  that you must be 18 or over, the operator then asks the 
  caller if he/she would allow the Emergency Committee to send 
  a mailgram in the caller's name to their two Senators and  
  one Representative. 
  
2.) If the caller says yes, the above process takes place and is 
  billed to the caller's home phone.  The caller leaves 
  his/her name, address, and zip code which is then matched  
  with the corresponding congressional district to assure that 
  the correct elected officials receive the mailgram. 
  
  The Alliance has put together a steering committee currently 
made up of more than a dozen organizations to participate in  
message development and the disbursement of any funds that are   
collected over and beyond the costs for set up and maintenance of  
the number.  You are invited to join this steering committee. 
There is no cost for this participation. 
  
  In order for this emergency campaign to be effective, we   
need your help to widely distribute the 1-900 number. 
Distribution of the number can be accomplished through the use of  
flyers, word of mouth, printing it in all local newspapers and   
membership organization's newsletters, radio announcements, 
posters, and on local computer Bulletin Board Services.  (The 
first flyers are now available.  Please call for a copy). 
Curtain speeches educating audiences about the crisis and drawing  
attention to ways to respond, are extremely effective and we urge  
you to undertake these and other activities.  The success of the 
emergency campaign depends on this effort. 
  
  The future of arts and cultural funding in this country is 
being determined by members of Congress NOW.  More than ever, the  
voices of arts supporters must be heard. 
  
  Thank you for participating in this critical grassroots 
effort.  Please call the American Arts Alliance at 202-737-1727  
if you would like to join the steering committee or have any  
questions.

 Welcome to the Poetics List. 
  
 Please note that this is a private list and information about   
 the list should not be posted to other lists or directories. 
 The idea is to keep the list to those with specific rather 
 than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the  
 list small and the volume managable.  Word-of-mouth (and its 
 electronic equivalents) seems to be working fine: please feel   
 free to invite people you know to sign-up.  
  
To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to   
  
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu  
  
Leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message blank.  In the 
body of your e-mail message type: 
  
  review poetics 
  
(The shorter bitnet address is listserv@ubvm. All further 
references to "Listserve" are to this listserve.) 
  
The list has open subscriptions.  You can sub or unsub by sending a one-line  
message, with no subject line, to the listserv address: 
  
unsub poetics Jill Jillway  
  
{or}  
  
sub poetics Jill Jillway  
  
I will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. 
  
ARCHIVES  
  
There are two ways to get archives, the second (see end 
of message) may be easier.  
  
Anyone interested in an archive of all postings after March may  
send this message to "Listserve": 
  
index poetics 
  
or  
  
index poetics f=mail 
  
You will receive a list of archived files in a format that  
includes something like this: 
  
* rec  last - change 
* filename filetype GET PUT -fm lrecl nrecs date time 
  
  POETICS  LOG9403  ALL OWN V  80  1012 94/05/31 07:17:17

You can then send the "get" command to "Listserve" in the format:  
  
get filename filetype  (eg: get poetics log9403   
  get poetics log9403   
  get poetics notebook) 
  
or  
  
get filename filetype f=mail  
  
depending on which log file you want (you can also get multiple  
files with one message).  Note that each of the files has a 
different beginning and end date, eg LOG9404 starts 7 March and  
goes to 31 May and that dates overlap. Go figure!  "Poetics 
Notebook" is an anomalous name for what is, in effect, another   
log file.

To subscribe to RIF/T, the e-poetry magazine:  
  
Send an e-mail message to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu.  Leave   
the "Subject" line of the e-mail message blank.  In the body of  
your e-mail message type: 
  
subscribe e-poetry Firstname Lastname 
  
where Firstname and Lastname correspond to your name. 
  
You will receive a confirmation of your subscription soon 
thereafter.  (Nonsubscribers can automatically sub to Poetics 
using this same format, but substituting "poetics" for "e-  
poetry".)

The Electronic Poetry Center (Buffalo) 7-10-94  
  
________________________Announcement________________________  
  
THE ELECTRONIC POETRY CENTER (BUFFALO).  The mission of this  
World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to serve as  
a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of  
activity in formally innovative writing in the United States  
and the world.  The Center will provide access to numerous  
electronic resources in the new poetries including RIF/T and  
other electronic poetry journals, the Poetics List archives,  
a library of poetic texts, news of related print sources, 
and direct connections to numerous related poetic projects. 
  
  
The Center's first phase of implementation is scheduled for 
August 1, 1994.  A subscription to the E-Poetry list  
provides a subscription to the electronic journal RIF/T and 
E-Poetry Center announcements.  Subscriptions to E-Poetry to  
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu  Inquiries, suggestions for  
Center resources, submissions to RIF/T, and other mail may  
be directed to e-poetry@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu  The Center is  
located at gopher://writing.upenn.edu/11/internet/library/e-  
journals/ub/rift  (Presently, the prototype is under  
construction but operational.)  
  
 Gopher Access:  
 For those who have access to gopher, type 
 gopher writing.upenn.edu  
 (or, if you are on a UB mainframe, simply type wings)  
 at your system prompt.  First choose Libraries & 
 Library Resources, then Electronic Journals, then E- 
 Journals/Resources Produced Here At UB, then The 
  
  
 Electronic Poetry Center.  (Note:  Connections to some 
 Poetry Center resources require Web access, though most  
 are presently available through gopher).  
  
 World-Wide Web Access: 
 For those with World-Wide Web or lynx access, type www 
 or lynx at your system prompt.  Choose the go to URL 
 option then go to (type as one continuous string)  
 gopher://writing.upenn.edu/11/internet/ 
 library/e-journals/ub/rift  
  
___Participation in the Electronic Poetry Center (Buffalo)___ 
  
For those interested in helping us build the Center, our  
goal is to provide a single Internet site that offers a 
doorway into the different poetic projects out there in the 
electronic (and paper) poetics world.  We would like to 
offer access to information about poetics and poetry  
activities, electronic poetry journals, texts in progress,  
etc.  We are currently developing a library of electronic 
poetry/poetics texts (submissions to e-poetry@ubvm.cc.  
buffalo.edu).  The Center has other exciting possibilities: 
 1. Circulation of electronic journals with an  
emphasis on direct links to those of relevance to Center  
concerns; 
 2. Reviews of recent print and electronic  
publications.  (Brief reviews may also be submitted 
electronically to e-poetry@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu);  
 3. Direct links to other related electronic sites; 
 4. Multimedia resources.  Sound and graphics relating  
to poetry.  
 5. Building our Small Press Alcove, a place for  
little magazine and book announcements.  The point of 
including announcements of paper resources is to provide a  
listing of interesting work for people to look at; they can 
then write or e-mail the publisher to obtain publications.  
  
(Send announcements to lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu or  
magazines/books to Loss Glazier, E-Poetry, P.O. Box 143,  
Getzville, NY 14068-0143);  
 6. Ultimately, the Center could also offer 
collaborative projects (perhaps for specific groups of  
writers), lists and/or archives of other lists, and texts-in- 
progress, as things develop.  
  
The "Buffalo" in the title of the Center is not meant to  
suggest that this activity is limited to Buffalo, only to 
give the "visitor" a sense of place, i.e., where the  
mainframe that's providing this service is "located." 
Vigorous writing wants to "circulate."  On this new 
electronic terrain, the Electronic Poetry Center will serve 
as a gathering place or point of entry for a range of poetic  
efforts.  
  
______________________How to Contact Us_____________________  
  
Please contact us with your suggestions, texts, sound files,  
and graphics files to submit, or if you have expertise in 
these areas.  LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK (this is meant to  
be a Center that grows with your ideas) by posting to this

DEFOE, by Leslie Scalapino, 
  
Classics 46, 365 pages, $12.95; ISBN # 1-55713-163-5  
  
  
  DEFOE, Leslie Scalapino's new fiction, is an epic where images of 
battle become meditations, an epic wherein events flap in silence as the  
narrative moves toward a place where the reader and text become one. The  
images of this fiction don't resemble events, but are new occurences in   
time and space. In Part I, Waking Life, the heroine, in love with James   
Dean, discovers herself in a desert pocked with fires in which the "henna 
man"- a drug dealer- is being carried in a white cocoon. And throughout   
Scalapino's work the reader is taken into a world where the written word  
creates " an event retrieved from so far back that it is separated from its 
memory." While not resembling reality/history, the fictionalizing induces 
the simplest movement possible in its whole expanded, unique structure, to  
change real past and present.

  Memory Play, Carla Harryman, 72 pages, $8.50. ISBN # 1-882022-22-x. 
In Memory Play, one is neither fixed in a memory nor is one in the 
(non-reactive) politicized moment of the present without memory. The 
child-non-innocent Pelican, Child, Reptile, and Fish, of Carla Harryman's 
play are lucid Alices (in Wonderland) observing history which as if  
backwards is creating phenomena. Harryman's play creates a state that is  
non/innocent in that it is our real present in our really being innocent, 
rather than an idea of such in a myth state of 'Garden of Eden.' 
  Steve Benson says: "Suppose you had a dream life and woke up not a  
person interested in telling as a story what you could recall of it as it 
coudl be translated and tricked into the words and images of a narrative  
that made sense by referring to the things of this world as your 
interlocutor knows them as well as you do but woke rather or also as a 
polyvocal projection of theater articulating time and personality and  
politics in idiosyncratic motion and congruence much as clouds and birds in 
flight make sense to that visionary in you.....   
  
  
  Collision Center, Randall Potts, 72 pages. $9.00. ISBN # 
1-882022-19-X. This is a first book by a young poet creating multiple  
narratives in a collision of lyrical and hard tones, isolating words and  
tones in order to allow their actuality, effectively to allow them to  
occur.  
  Ann Lauterbach comments: "In Randall Potts' poems, nature and  
language collide, and then proceed, each having been transformed by the   
other. ... We witness the newly manifest being carried away on the stark  
clarities of his lines, "watchlessly dis-figuring / what remains to be 
seen." There is gratitude and there is terror: here they embrace.  
  
  
  MOB, Abigail Child, 96 pages. $9.50. ISBN # 1-882022-21-1. Child's  
writing scrutinizes the factor of need, our "making need / the figure they  
want," as the mind's need as contemplation of lust touching a civilization. 
  Bruce Andrews comments about MOB: "Only the impossible is intimate  
enough."  
  She creates a form that isn't landscape yet is a visible 
reverberation, "the sky is drunk with ... The center in front of the 
future," realistic and filmic in that the non-landscape is "frames (which)  
hit the screen/dependent on the intent", thus subject and object of their 
own scrutiny and direction which is motivation.   
  Kevin Killian comments: "her new book is a fiery J'Accuse against a 
war-fueled heterosexist Uberhaus that flaunts "the privilege of a window  
ignoring its cost." She has always been a provocative poet and thinker, but 
now she writes her twin obsessions into transparence. Between the words   
vast flamethrowers aimed by angels singe and give off steam." 
  
  
  GROUND AIR, Scott Bentley, xerox 59 pages, $6.00. ISBN # 
1-882022-23-8. A first book by a young poet about whose work Jennifer  
Moxley comments: "As for AIR, so what if we continue to build our loves on  
the banks of sorrowful Ilion, stolen kisses and all that. At least Scott, 
like Dido, knows there's more to life than duty. After all, those  
paleolithic bison were so real you could've hunted them and this language 
is so true that it runs a body amuck. In both we find the inherent 
vulgarity of the natural, where every key or brush stroke makes desire's  
ineffable history more seductive."  
  Kit Robinson says: "Then, having established this deceptively  
enveloping GROUND, Bentley takes off into AIR, constructing intimate spaces 
where 'Everything's / tender and sudden.'"

Subject:  Re: motives for metaphor   
  
 Marisa (Januzzi)- 
 I wasn't going to reply because I too feel "at a loss" when it comes   
 to "recommended readings" on the huge subject of political content  
 of poetic form. It's not because of a dearth of material but because   
 of a plenitude. It's so prevalent an issue in most of what I read to   
 have run the risk of becoming a BLASE issue. At least IN THEORY. Yet   
 theory is only as "good" as its praxis, its enactment. So I work by 
 a case-by-case basis here in quoting this just because I happen to be  
 reading it at the time (not that I mean to irresponsibly claim it's 
 a mere arbitrary issue of 'taste'): In Carla Harryman's VICE, page 28, 
 and 29, she writes: 
 "and he went over to talk to his linguist friend, George Lakoff,   
  about the sense of finality evoked by the word LAND when what he  
  was really looking for was more like some forward moving limbo.

George Lakoff's work is certainly taken seriously and is well worth  
attending to. Although METAPHORS WE LIVE BY is still a worthwhile  
place to start, GL has two other books which should not be missed: 
  
Women, Fire, & Dangerous Things (University of Chicago Press) 
and 
More Than Cool Reason (can't put my hand on my copy in mess at hand, 
so no pub. listed, but I think it is also u of c press) 
  
More... is co-authored by Mark Turner, whose READING MINDS (Princeton  
U Press) is also well worth reading. Think of the dep't of english 
as a part of cognitive studies. 
  
Good luck. I might mention that the study of theory in regard of its 
core subject matters of mathematics, physics, etc. (and of philosophy  
of science) is a more rewarding activity, in my experience at least, 
than time spent with the "theory" movement in american academic  
writing. In '92 I spent a while reading thru this latter corpus  
of mat'ls, reading something by everybody in the big Literary 
Theory compilation (pub. - *again!* u of c?) and a dozen or so   
other books (not scrupulously read, but tried). This reading  
project resulted in a trimester of extreme depression, and I do  
not recommend it to anyone.

Subj: RE: JRNL: Poetry on the Margins, cont. 
  
With regard to Shoemaker's further remarks and Silliman's contributions,  
maybe a few more comments might buzz along the web from here and draw some  
interest from whoever "lives along the line," as Pope and his classical   
ancestors have put it.  First, is it not interesting that "poets" have 
their separate web?  Is it not also interesting that networkers can assume  
those of us etherized on this part of the table are professors NOT poets, 
while 
those in the poet-hammock hangup of this network ARE poets, whether  
professors or 
not?  Does anyone think this kind of compartmenting is part of the reasons  
poets and poetry are perceived as marginalized?   
Second, since a poet has  
asked the question of what the metaphor of margins is supposed to mean,   
let me respond--as medievalist, teacher of American Indian Literature, and  
practicing poet--that I believe the basic metaphor is that of TEXT vs. 
MARGIN, and I take it that in the medieval period the text was that  
"woven" part of the page's words, while the margin was the place outside  
the weaving, where space was "free."  One way "progress" took place, that 
is, people invented an idea called the Renaissance and relegated the 
medieval period to a meaningless dark MIDDLE AGES unlike the clean 
well-lighted humanistic Sixteenth Century of enlightened popes, holy Roman  
Emperors, reformed bishops and kings able to marry all they wanted, and so  
on--one way was to turn the marginalized things of the previous age into  
the textualized central part of the page.  Instead of the Virgin Mary, 
they looked at models for the Virgin Mary, instead of a human image  
representing a cosmos, they looked at the image as representing an 
individual unlike all others.  You no longer talked of a soul, you talked 
of a self--in English, that is, a language in which it was possible to 
take the former pronominal intensifier and turn it into a noun and let 
it carry the responsibilities which a soul had earlier had to bear.  You  
invented psychology.  You invented a blank table on which the senses wrote  
you you you.  (Well maybe you didn't do this, and neither did I, but it   
seems kind of nasty to keep blaming THEM for it, so I am giving you the   
honor of riding out of the Middle Ages on the rail of Self.) So anyhow, I 
take it that behind all the political discourse of margins there is the   
original textual discourse, the manuscript making, the writerly image. 
Does that make sense? It should please any language poet, should it not?  
  
But there is another assumption I'd like to look at.  Someone pointed out 
very usefully that poetry requires readers to learn the culture inscribed 
within it, before the poems make sense.  Is this not also true of prose?  
Is it not true of the Dick and Jane readers, as well as of the James and  
Nora or Tom and Viv or Emily and God anthologies?  Is it not true of any  
human utterance, or lifting of an eyebrow?  I suspect therefore that it   
does not differentiate poetry from the rest of the noises off or on the   
page or stage or CD-ROM.  
  
I was thinking about this particular Silver Screen Dialogue as I was 
looking up, yesterday, the pseudo-Albertus Magnus Book of Secrets, in  
which I finally found (having looked off an on since 1980 or so) the 
probable source of a Latin excerpt copied about 1340 in or near Ludlow by 
a scribe who was a minor lawyer and probably a chaplain there.  The  
excerpt occurs on fol. 137r of BL MS Harley 2253, and its two parts  
describe the herbs heliotrope (marigold) and celandine.  Of heliotrope it 
is said that whoever gathers it in summer, when the Sun is in the Virgin, 
i.e. in August, and rolls it in a laurel leaf and adds the tooth of a  
wolf, will be able to pacify all opponents with his discourse; also, if   
anything has been stolen from him, and he lays this under his head at  
night, he will see the thief and perceive all the thief's circumstances.  
Further, if one places this leaf etc. inside a church within which are 
women who have committed adultery, none of the women shall have power to  
go out of that church without confessing to it.  Of celandine, we are told  
that if one wraps it around the heart of a mole, one will successfully 
overcome all opponents in discourse, even litigation; and if one places   
the celandine and mole-heart under the head of any sick person, then if   
that person is fated to die he or she will begin to sing loudly, but if   
fated to recover will begin at once to weep. What, you may ask, has this  
to do with the difficulty of reading poetry, or with the alienation of 
poetry's audience, or with marginalizing of poetic discourse?  Well, there  
is a poem in this manuscript (Harley 2253--in case you are interested, 
there is a facsimile that is Early English Text Society No.  255, 1964,   
edited by the great paleographer N. R. Ker; and there is an edition of the  
famous "Harley Lyrics" from this manuscript by G. L.  Brook, as well as by  
various other scholars), which consists of five stanzas in each of which  
the poet compares the lady he is praising to something beautiful and 
wholesome:  in stanza one, to various gems; in two, to flowers and herbs  
(including celandine and marigold--solsecle is the poet's term for the 
latter, which is derived from the Latin Solsequium that occurs in the  
latin excerpt I have mentioned above); in three, to birds; in four, to 
medicinal herbs or potions; and in five, to heroes and heroines of 
"romances" including Welsh, Germanic, and French prose and poetry. 
  
By now you have guessed that my point is how obscure and difficult this   
poem must be.  It is also heavily alliterative, obviously a highly ornate 
piece of poetry.  But one of the nicest things about it is that its poet  
has found a very clever way to both conceal and give away the name of the 
lady he is praising--I should add that in such poems, the medieval writers  
usually make it a taboo to name the lady, since a courtly lover's affair  
is actually not supposed to be made public except so far as the pair of   
them show the symptoms of love, and the man is allowed to "complain" in a 
GENERAL way, naming no names.  This poet, however, has managed to name his  
beloved in a riddling way, in the third stanza when he is comparing her to  
birds:  HIRE NOME IS IN A NOTE OF THE NYHTEGALE, IN ANNOTE IS HIRE NOME:  
NEMPNETH HIT NONE!  WHOSO RIGHT READETH, RUNE TO JOHON!  The clever reader  
or listener will easily see that the lady's name is Annote, and any  
medieval or medievalist with half a brain would know that that is a pet   
name or nickname for Agnes, so the poet is saying:  Listen up now and  
you'll hear her name--and when you get it, whisper it to John!   
  
I think the poet could certainly expect his readers (it may have been HER 
readers, though we have little evidence for women lyricists in the 1300's;  
little is not NONE!) to get the riddle.  But at that point we have another  
question:  what's the poet doing breaking this taboo?  I think the answer 
is that the poem is addressed to, and intended for reading aloud to, a 
courtly audience of men and women, and that the names Agnes and John were 
very common names--so that a given audience might have several women and  
men with those names.  The "answer" would therefore become a "debate 
topic", and not only WHICH Agnes, but which JOHN for which Agnes, would be  
debated.  Can we now go back to that Marigold and Celandine?  The poet 
expects his audience to understand that the lady is not merely like  
flowers of various colors and fragrances, but flowers and herbs and gems  
and birds and medicines of various powers--reputed or real, credible or   
just "interesting" is not certain, according to Lynn Thorndike's History  
of Science account of the pseudo-Albertus Magnus BOOK OF SECRETS in which 
the powers of celandine and marigold are explicated, and from which the   
Harley 2253 scribe carefully copied those passages.  The audience would   
not only know this plant-lore and gem-lore and bird-lore (and star-lore,  
since the gems and plants linked to Zodiac), but would presumably have the  
romances all by heart so that comparing the lady to their heroes and 
heroines would make as much sense as our references to Hamlet or Portia or  
Oedipus or Prufrock. 
  
SO, AS I SAY, I was thinking about this question of marginalizing poetry  
yesterday as I was dinking about the Science and History of Science  
shelves trying to get a little footnote finished.  But you know, one 
reason I was doing that was that I had just read Gayle Margherita's new   
book on medieval literature, all the Lacan and Freud and Marx and such,   
and been greatly interested by her marvelous hammerlock on the poet of 
ANNOTE AND JOHON, who clearly was a patriarchal bastard if ever there was 
one.  And I was the more interested because she cited Daniel Ransom's  
earlier book on the Harley Lyrics in which he claimed there are all sorts 
of obscene puns in ANNOTE AND JOHON, and it was a little hard to tell  
whether she thought Ransom was right or thought he was worse than the  
Harley Lyricist.  Anyhow it occurred to me that one reason we may have a  
lot of non-readers of poetry is that we have convinced so many potential  
readers that they have to ask a professor before daring to dip into any   
collection of real literature.  And once we ask, we are treated to an  
incredible pile of unbelievable interpretations, all of burning  
importance, all proving that every medieval poet was John D Rockefeller   
plus John Gacy plus the Marquis de Sade plus Faulkner's Popeye, at least  
when not proving that the poets were really (according to D. W. Robertson 
of blessed Princetonian memory) John Knox or a Polish Pope. So it is just 
possible that professors have marginalized their texts pretty 
athletically.  Having perfected an Explanation Factory, having apprenticed  
all readers to this factory and seen to it that they are chained to the   
sewing machines fabricating not glosses or footnotes but literary  
bi-ogre-phy, we have committed them to reading poetry, fiction, essays,   
newspapers, laws as projections of the psyches of damaged tyrants and  
misers and sociopaths of various talents and inclinations.  
  
Well, maybe that is just auld, lang, and syne. 
  
But having got into the Science section of our library, and actually found  
a book on the shelf that was said by the computer system to be there, and 
got the footnotes, and read the intelligent and interesting discussion by 
Margherita (U of Penn Press, 1994; well worth reading, lots besides the   
problematic misreading of the Harley Lyrics), and so on, I managed to get 
a copy of the magazine SCIENCE and look at its piece casting doubt on the 
existence of Black Holes (Jeez, how to write a headline for THAT?!) and   
another on the anniversary of Oncogene Research in which Harold Varmus,   
head of NEH and recent Nobelman for that work, had a few things to say and  
I was reflecting on what a good student of English Literature Varmus had  
been at Amherst College when I was a junior instructor there. And I kept  
thinking, you know, if I pick up SCIENCE, I expect to get news, some 
surprises, some revisions.  If I pick up a journal of poetry I don't 
expect that.  Is that maybe one reason people don't pick up poetry 
journals?  But of course scientists complain of being marginalized too.  I  
read that 14.7% of Math Ph.D.'s are going unemployed.  Wonder what kind of  
poet Harold Varmus would have made? 
  
You must have asked me the question I am about to answer:  How to get back  
into the text people read?  The answer is:  be a good host.  You let some 
of the guests tell stories too.  You answer questions, you bring other 
characters onto the show.  You treat readers as guests, and not as 
unworthy approachers of your throne.  I bet this will make quite a few 
readers--especially some who class themselves as poets--mad as hell.  I   
bet the romantic view of poets as dictating rather than as entertaining is  
still the going thing.  I bet the view of readers as not deserving of the 
wonderful stuff poets are writing is the common one.  I bet poets still   
think of themselves as abused victims of the Philistine masses.  And of   
course the damnable truth is that I write what I please and invent,  
afterwards, excuses, rationales, explanations which may have little to do 
with motives and techniques and processes of the actual writing.  Still,  
it seems to me poetry is intended to be a shared thing, a way of getting  
together with people and things and creatures, not a way of walling out or  
walling in only.  A really great poet should do what Shakespeare did, or  
Dickens, take a popular medium and make it bear great poetry.  The rest of  
us can try to do that and no doubt fall way short.  But I still think if  
we do it right people will laugh with us, go up the mountain with us,  
because they will find our words help them, speak to them, make sense of  
experience they know personally and closely.  Sometimes it even seems that  
really good poetry is whatever people read for themselves because they 
need it.  But that would allow the directions for microwaving a tuna 
casserole to be poetry, I suppose.

Subj: RE: JRNL: Poetry on the Margins, cont. 
  
I would like to respond to a few things Ron Silliman mentions in his 
reponse to our responses to the Poetry on the Margins questions.  I  
thought his comments on the communities of poets helps a lot.  They are   
everywhere, in towns and boroughs, on electronic boards, in letters that  
they exchange with each other.  More so I suspect than 10 or 20 years ago 
and I take that as hopeful.  I'm not as interested as he is, though, in   
setting up good guys and bad guys in the language of the establishment 
poets and the others, more particularly the Language Poets.  I remember   
being very excited about what was happening in Language Poetry when  
Ironwood did an issue devoted to the work, but itdidn't seem to me then   
nor does it seem to me now that Language Poetry needs to have the  
establishment to stand against in order to be language poetry in the 
Objectivist tradition and to extend that tradition. I feel thesame way,   
for example, about Gluck and Olds.  They represent different traditions,  
different extensions of those traditions, but they don't need to position 
the  other as the blackhat in order to be credible.  The philosophy and   
language of each is not the others but so what.  I think of a recent poem 
by Elaine Equi that goes like this: 
PRESCRIPTION  
  
Take Herrick  
for melancholy   
  
Niedecker 
for clarity 
  
O'Hara  
for nerve 
  
The poem, for me, says there are different things totake fromm differnt   
poets.  So the, for teaching, it becomes a question ofhowto putbefore my  
students, most of whom are not readers of poetry or fiction, contemporary 
poetry so that they would be willing to contiue to read and perhaps to 
write it.  Ithink then of letting them see the difference rather than, 
say, presenting them with just my preferences, and letting them write and 
talk about the difference to see for themselves what might be available   
to them from modern poetry.  Sure I have a theory of organization and  
history, as Ron points out, and I can certainly see his suspicion of it   
as I would be suspicious of other teachers and their agendas if I had one 
I was proposing over others, but it isnot ppossible to not have, even in  
the slightest way, a theory of organization and history.  At best, I 
think, I can see mine, such as it is, and be up front with my students 
about where I come from and how I organize.  
  
This is a related problem to thinking about teaching any texts, it 
seems.  I don't want it to prevent me from presenting modern poetry to my 
composition students or my intro. to lit. students or my school of Ed. 
students who want to be secondary teachers.  Most of them know almost  
nothing about poetry.  They have smatterings of Frost, Whitman, and Emily 
Dickinson in them, but what they have read usually stops there.  The 
don't kow about the communities of writers in magazines like AMERICAN  
VOICE or the ST.MARKS POETRY PROJECT NEWSLETTER.  So it's not that I 
would propose that there is a "defining privilege for the classroom in 
determining the answer to the question" of why poetry is marganilized but 
thatI would propose the classroom, all kinds of classrooms (e.g.,  
religious studies, composition, educational methods, and so on)as places  
where poetry can be a part of the curriculum to address questions in 
those subjects and areas, to be, that is, a part of the conversations of  
thinking about, say, soul, or language and culture, or American  
traditions. 
  
It is within thiscontext, the one that has to do with speaking to my 
collelagues about why I might include poetry in these courses, that I  
locate the problem of poetry on the margins.  THe other issues, the  
unchanged state of distribution of poetry, Bill Moyers and Robert Bly, 
the creation of good guys and bad guys in poetry weren't my subjects in   
the last postings, although those seem to me to be certainly related 
issues.  My expeerience is that my colleagues, college and secondary 
English teachers, by and large are not familiar with the vaariious 
traditions and commnities of poets or fiction writers, and I'm interested 
in how this might be changed and I see a place to begin in my immediate   
teaching by positioning poetry as a serious voice avaailble to my  
students.  I still don't see theusefulness of fractionalism.  As poets it 
is possible to discuss poetry that is not the poetry we write or prefer   
without positioning it to be establishment, representative of larger 
social forces, bad, and so on. The difference is a place for discussion   
rather than dissmisal.  In the movesof dismissal and disparagement the 
new boss--the culturall critique--is the old boss--New Critical  
critique--with another name and another set of terms.  It'sthe same end   
game:  who shall be judged or critiqued the true (and we all know about   
the will to truth now, don't we, from Foucault for instance), with the 
same divisiveness, and I don't think that helps poetry communities,  
poetry, or my thinking about howto present poetry to my students and 
colleagues.  I like theEqui poem and what it proposes.  Locate me there.

From: IN%"lauter@Mail.Trincoll.Edu"  "Paul Lauter"  8-JAN-1995 17:47:48.97  
Subj: Poetry at the Margins 
  
  I want to pick up on one of Ron Silliman's side comments, which   
criticized me for making what he called "a gratuitous (and completely  
reductive) slap at the avant-garde tradition (w/o recognizing it as the   
only 'international' literary tradition the world has ever had)."  
  Ron is certainly right in criticizing the offhand way I  
criticized the tradition of Eliot and Pound, and many of their   
successors.  One shouldn't do that in a sentence, any more than one  
should attack the equally pernicious impact of abstract expressionism and 
its apologists, like Hilton Kramer, in a sentence.  I didn't want to 
repeat what I had written at length elsewhere--there's one piece coming   
out in an NCTE volume edited by Jim Slevin and Art Young and another in   
the next issue of the Yale J of Crit. In both I reflect on the powerful 
hold that the critical tradition derived from Eliot, Pound, Ransom,  
Brooks, etc. has had even on those of us committed to a revisionist  
canon.  I think that hold is most of all demonstrated in the New Critical 
ways in which poetry continues largely to be taught, especially in 
secondary schools. And in the ways we conceive--even in a revisionist   
anthology like the HEATH--literary/ historical conceptions like  
"modernism."  
  Here it's worth considering the other post, from an unnamed high  
school teacher, that appeared with Ron's post.  The teacher mourned the   
fact that his or her students don't share a great deal of the culture  
assumed even by relatively approachable poets like Frost.  Thus the  
teacher is put in the position of being the class expert--nothing wrong   
with that, as such, and probably inevitable in many situations.  Yet for  
students, in my observation, that turns poetry into a puzzle to which an  
observably more "mature" person has the key, rather than into a form in   
which they may participate.  I think the result of this dynamic is to  
create among many and perhaps most students a kind of fear and loathing,  
a sense that poetry, writing in general, is something done by people 
other than themselves, different from them, distant from them.  And that, 
it seems to me, is precisely the intent of Eliot's form of  
modernism--see, for example, his comments on the special qualities of the 
poet's "sensibility" in "The Metaphysical Poets."  Eliot's point, I would 
argue (after Adreas Huyssen in "Mass Culture as Woman: Modernism's 
Other," AFTER THE GREAT DIVIDE), is precisely to create the critical and  
teaching apparatus that underwrites the elite forms of poetic practice 
he helped develop. 
  This is still a shorthand form of the argument, to be sure.  And  
one can speculate about Eliot's psychology--as in "Tom and Viv"--or about 
the conservative politics he shared with the founders of the New 
Criticism.  Those are interesting issues, to be sure.  But here I only 
want to suggest that the continuing impact of this tradition is to help   
create distance between many people who pass through the educational 
system and those forms of language designated within it as "poetry." 
  Underlying the argument is, of course, the question of what we 
agree to call "poetry."  It's the issue Cary Nelson powerfully joins by,  
for example, quoting H.H. Lewis' little argument about material  
conditions and consciousness: 
  Here I am  
  Hunkered over the cow-donick, 
  Earning my one dollar per 
  And realizing, 
  With goo upon overalls, 
  How environment works up a feller's  
 pant-legs to govern his thought.  
  (Thinking of Russia) 
Let's leave it at that for the time being.

James,  
  
This is a wonderful thought! The problem is the old thinking-on-your-  
feet angle. In other words, things are changing so fast that it's not  
only the challenge but the luxury and joy of maintaining such a  
"center." 
  
Dichotomies seem to be the crux of the issue. We originally designed 
everything for gopher but as the Web grew, that became preferable. And 
the small details, now able to load numerous graphics and sound files  
into the system, it's incredible to watch it grow. It's not just the 
challlenge but the thrill of it.  
  
Now, even as we discuss this, I learn that an http address will have 
been shortly instituted. So an announcement there will be shortcoming! 
  
Only to say I try to stay on it, here we go, and the present  
possibilities are immense...  
  
Best wishes,  
Loss

Hi, folks.  I've been meaning to respond to Charles Bernstein's invitation  
to post information about our press at least since October, but haven't had 
the time or energy to sit down and write up a proper description until now. 
  
Viet Nam Generation, Inc. is a small literary and educational nonprofit   
501(c)(3) corporation.  I founded it in 1988 when I was a grad student in 
American Studies.  Viet Nam Generation, Inc. was founded to support the   
publication of an interdisciplinary journal, _Viet Nam Generation_,  
dedicated to providing a forum for scholars, artists and activists 
interested in the 1960s in the U.S. and internationally.  Now the journal is  
entering its seventh volume-year.  In 1990 we started publishing a line of  
monographs, fiction and poetry related, in some fashion, to our subject area  
of the 1960s.  We've currently got 27 titles in print (including those 
forthcoming in 1995).  I was joined in my endeavors by my partner Dan Duffy 
(in 1991) and Steve Gomes (in 1993).  We continue to work full-time on a  
volunteer basis, but hope to be stable enough to pay small salaries by the  
end of 1995.  
  
Viet Nam Generation, Inc. also sponsors the Sixties Project, a collective of  
scholars interested in the 1960s, housed at the Institute of Advanced  
Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville.  
As part of the Sixties Project we maintain the electronic discussion list 
SIXTIES-L.  
  
POETICS readers might be interested in the publications listed below. As  
you'll notice, many of the books are in our "White Noise" series.  I think  
we may be the only press admittedly publishing middle-aged white guys as an 
ethnic group.  Our other series is titled "Widespread Panic," and features a  
variety of poets whose work is distinguished by its confrontational nature....

VIET NAM GENERATION/BURNING CITIES PRESS POETRY PUBLICATIONS  
  
_Viet Nam Generation: A Journal of Recent History and Contemporary Culture_.  
Accepts poetry submissions.  We're looking for work which can be at least 
loosely related to the 1960s in subject matter, influence, politics, or   
form.  Length is no object--we've published everything from short-shorts to 
30-page cycles.  We usually produce double-issues, so the journal  
effectively comes out twice a year, averages 220pp, perfect bound, with no  
advertising. There are only three of us reading all poetry submissions and  
responding to authors, so it sometimes takes us a while (up to 4 months) to 
respond. We publish 15-20 poets in an issue.  Sample copies are available 
for $15 each. 
  
AMATO, JOE. _Symptoms of a Finer Age_. 92 pages, perfect bound, paper, 
4-color cover, forthcoming March 1995. White Noise #5. ISBN: 1-885215-12-6. 
Joe will no doubt blush when he reads this (hi Joe!), but we think the world  
of him.  Joe teaches English and composition at the Illinois Institute of 
Technology. His technical expertise is combined with passion, a fine ear for  
language, and a strong sense of social justice. Reading his work is like  
watching a skilled professional put on a stunning display of Fourth of July 
fireworks--even the most cynical can't help being taken in by the magic.  We  
figure that 25 or 30 years from now, when the lit critters look back and  
marvel at the wealth of talent that Viet Nam Generation, Inc. has managed to  
assemble, we'll be most appreciated for showcasing Joe....  
  
BARKER, DAN, _Warrior of the Heart_. 276 pages, perfect bound, paper,  
2-color cover, 1992. ISBN: 0-9628524-7-3. $15.  When Dan Barker's manuscript  
came "over the transom," we knew it was the answer to our publishing 
prayers.  What arrived that day was one of the finest Viet Nam war 
narratives that we'd ever read. And we'd read hundreds. We never did figure 
out if _Warrior of the Heart_ was poetry or prose, and we don't really care.  
It's fucking beautiful, and it doesn't flinch. Dan Barker served as a naval 
corpsman attached to the Marine Corps in Viet Nam.  He is the founder and 
director of The Home Gardening Project, which has built over 1,100 
raised-bed vegetable gardens for the aged, disabled and single-parent  
families of Portland, Oregon. 
  
CHRISTOPHER, RENNY, _Viet Nam and California_. 82 pages, perfect bound,   
paper, 2-color cover, forthcoming September 1995. Widespread Panic #2. ISBN:  
1-885215-13-4.  Renny's poems are strong and straightforward. They tell the 
story of a woman's coming-of-age in the period during and after the Viet Nam  
war, and of her relationships with several Viet Nam veterans. These spare 
portraits are grounded in Renny's solid sense of herself as a woman with  
working-class roots. 
  
COLEMAN, HORACE, _In the Grass_.  84 pages, perfect bound, paper, 2-color 
cover, forthcoming October 1995.  Widespread Panic #3. ISBN: 1-885215-17-7. 
Horace is an African-American rebel poet.  His early Viet Nam war poetry was  
featured in the first collections assembled by W.D. Ehrhart and First  
Casualty Press, and his poem gave the title to Ehrhart's _Carrying the 
Darkness_ anthology.  Over the years Horace's tongue has sharpened and his  
anger has been refined into the razor bite of _In the Grass_. This is a long  
overdue collection of his work. 
  
CONNOLLY, DAVID, _Lost in America." 72 pages, perfect bound, paper, 2-color 
cover, 1994. White Noise #1. ISBN: 1-885215-00-2. $12.  David Connolly was  
born, raised, and still lives in South Boston. He was a nineteen-year-old 
infantryman in Viet Nam--the product of a close Irish Catholic, pro-IRA,  
working class family. During his year at war he became sick at heart over 
what his country was doing to a people whose lifestyle and struggle he came 
to see as being closely related to that of his own heritage. A quarter of a 
century later, Connolly still makes those connections with passion and 
power.  We just put this book out, so the reviews haven't started to filter 
back to us yet, but David gave a reading at a conference we held in November  
and in December we got 15 orders for his book from professors who wanted to 
use it in literature courses. 
  
EHRHART, W.D., _Just for Laughs_.  84 pages, perfect bount, paper, 4-color  
cover, 1990. ISBN: 0-9628524-0-6. $10.  By his writing and editing, W.D.  
Ehrhart made it possible to be a Viet Nam veteran writer. By his continued  
work, Ehrhart has become the conscience and inspiration for those who have  
been sparked into literature by seeing the American war machine on parade.  
_Just for Laughs_ brings poems addressing Ehrhart's return to Viet Nam, his 
marriage and family life, and the American wars in Central America. The   
final poems of this book summon Ehrhart's nightmare past as a Marine in Viet  
Nam, and evoke his pessimism about the future, from a sense that embraces 
the present with care and fear.  "W.D. Ehrhart continues to deserve  
recognition, perhaps more than any other, as the Vietnam author in his 
generation who in fact made the idea of such a thing possible in the first  
place." --Philip D. Beidler, _Re-Writing America: Vietnam Authors in their  
Generation_.  
  
JAFFE, MAGGIE, _Continuous Performance_. 64 pages, perfect bound, paper,  
2-color cover, 1990. ISBN: 0-9628524-6-5. $10.  Maggie Jaffe, peace activist  
and poet, interrogates the images of empire that form American ideals of  
war. She places "Viet Nam" in a continuum of aggression that begins with the  
Pilgrim Fathers and extends through the secret wars of the 1980s and 1990s. 
Her short poems are connected to the historical record by direct reference  
and opinionated statement.  "Maggie Jaffe's new poems expose the rot behind 
the baby pink veneer of our image makers. Her verse is boldly political, her  
human commitment passionate and profound." --Marianne Hauser.  "_Continuous 
Performance_ stands out as a testimony that Maggie Jaffe was not silent,  
when the times demanded that poets write about important issues." --Jon   
Forrest Glade, _American Book Review_.   
  
LIEBLER, M.L., _Stripping the Adult Century Bare_. 88 pages, perfect bound, 
paper, 2-color cover, forthcoming March 1995. White Noise #6. ISBN:  
1-885215-09-6. $12.  M.L. has been called a cross between T.S. Eliot and  
Ward Cleaver. He is a professor of English at Wayne State University, a   
small press publisher, and a social activist.  His Magic Poetry Band 
regularly performs in his home town of Detroit, and occasionally tours.   
_Stripping the Adult Century Bare_ is an anthology of Liebler's new and   
older verse, focusing on the impact of the 1960s on his life. His heroes are  
Jesus and John Lennon.  "M.L. Liebler is a tremendous source of poetry 
energy in the The Motor City and beyond." --John Sinclair.  "M.L. Liebler is  
a complex mix of poet, university professor, performance poet, Lollapalooza 
performer and Christian writer... he has played a vital role in keeping the 
poetry scene alive during its dark days of the 70s and 80s." --_The Detrois 
News_.  "M.L. Liebler is a piece of the reality poetry needs to stay alive. 
Alive, and kicking, not forgetting the hurt Americans inflict on themselves,  
each other, and the world--but ready to fight, and sing, the song of hope.  
He is a beacon! More power to Mike, and to the republic (of poetry and love)  
for which he stands." --Alice Ostriker   
  
MCCARTHY, GERALD, _Throwing the Headlines_. 72 pages, perfect bound, paper, 
2-color cover, forthcoming April 1995. White Noise #4. ISBN: 1-885215-12-6. 
$12.  Gerald McCarthy is well known to those who study the soldier-poets of 
the Viet Nam war. This collection spans two decades of McCarthy's work and  
is an important new contribution to the field of Viet Nam war poetry. The 
poems in _Throwing the Headlines_ reflect McCarthy's continuing passion for 
peace and justice. 
  
QUINTANA, LEROY, _Interrogations_. 102 pages, perfect bound, paper, 4-color 
cover, 1990.  ISBN: 0-9628524-5-7. Introduction by Yusef Komunyakaa. $10. 
The cover of this book features a watercolor made from a snapshot of 
Quintana's Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol. The short poems inside make art  
of the brief glimpses of his tour in Viet Nam. The collection of sharp,   
sudden poems from Viet Nam mounts to a longer moral address to   
then-President Bush, written just after the Gulf War. Introduce yourself to 
the details of jungle fighting, the perspective of a Chicano soldier, and 
the mature view of a poet who was a soldier once.  "The characters in  
_Interrogations_ have been given genuine depth, and in a few succinct lines 
they emerge as sharply defined human beings...." --Jon Forrest Glade,  
_American Book Review_.   
  
RICHMAN, ELLIOT, _Walk On, Trooper_.  92 pages, perfect bound, paper,  
2-color cover, 1994. White Noise #2. ISBN: 0-9628524-9-X. $12.  Elliot 
Richman published his first poem in 1984, when he was forty-two years old.  
Since then, his work has appeared widely in the small press. In 1993 he was 
awarded fellowships for his poetry by both the NEA and the New York  
Foundation for the Arts. Asylum Arts has published is two previous 
collections, _The World Dancer_ and _Honorable Manhood_.  Not a veteran,  
Elliot has probably published more individual poems about the Viet Nam war  
in more literary magazines than almost any veteran writer.  His passion and 
preoccupation (some might even say obsession) fascinated us, and we felt  
that we needed to collect his Viet Nam war poems and publish them under one 
cover.  Bill Shields, cowboy poet and hardcore combat vet (_Southeast Asian 
Book of the Dead_ and _Human Shrapnel_) has this to say about Elliot's work:  
"_Walk On, Trooper_ is one fucking real book. A straight walk into the beast  
with eyes wide open; it is the best--and I mean the best--book I've seen on 
the Viet Nam war. He went into hell to write it." We don't know if we  
completely agree with Bill, but we're sure that _Walk On, Trooper_ is  
mesmerizing.  
  
RITTERBUSCH, DALE, _Lessons Learned_. 82 pages, perfect bound, paper,  
2-color cover, forthcoming July 1995. White Noise #7. ISBN: 1-885215-08-8.  
$12.  Dale Ritterbusch began writing the poems in this volume over twenty 
years ago, while sitting in a class on M-60 emplacement in OCS at the  
Infantry School at Fort Benning. He's been writing ever since. Ritterbusch  
teaches English at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. His poetry came  
to our attention through the recommendation of W.D. Ehrhart, who discovered 
Dale years ago, while Ehrhart was compiling the poetry for the anthology  
_Carrying the Darkness_.  A version of _Lessons Learned_ received a  
publication grant in 1984 from the Ohio Arts Council, but the pressn which  
had committed to producing the book folded before it could be published. We 
are proud to produce a long-delayed volume which we are sure will become an 
instant classic of Viet Nam war literature.  
  
VANCIL, DAVID, _The Homesick Patrol_.  72 pages, perfect bound, paper, 
2-color cover, forthcoming June 1995. White Noise #3. ISBN: 1-885215-15-0.  
$12.  David Vancil served in Vietnam in 1969 in Khanh Hoa Province as a   
military advisor. He is a rare books librarian and small press publisher. 
David is the author of an earlier volume of poetry titled _The Art School 
Baby_, and is working on a memoir titled _The Sanest Man in Vietnam_. His 
verse is disciplined and elegant, the work of careful literary artist.

Subject: Course In Hypertext Poetry 
Reply-To: eastgate-list@world.std.com 
  
  
Robert Kendall will be teaching a class in hypertext fiction and poetry in the  
Spring 95 term at the New School for Social Research in New York, NY. The class 
will also be offered in the summer and fall as part of the New Schools Distance 
Instruction for Adult Learners (DIAL) program, in which all instruction takes 
place on-line.   
  
Kendall would like to hear from anyone at other schools that offer classes  
in hypertext or interactive literature. He's interested both in exchanging ideas
about teaching such a class and in exploring ways his students could exchange 
work with students in similar programs.  
  
HYPERTEXT POETRY AND FICTION  
Robert Kendall   
12 Tuesday evening sessions beginning Jan. 31, 1995.  
  
This course will provide an introductory survey of published interactive poetry 
and fiction that uses the computer monitor as its medium instead of the printed 
page. It will also be a workshop for students to create their own writing in  
this new genre. Students will explore 
  
- how the resources of the computer--hypertext, kinetic text, 
decision-making algorithms, randomization functions, graphics, and 
audio--can take literature in new directions not possible in print.  
  
- how poems and stories can assume nonlinear, reader-determined structures  
that emulate the dynamic nature of actual human experience, memory, and thought 
processes.  
  
- how the computer can combine the written tradition of literature with   
elements of its oral tradition, such as real-time performance (with or 
without musical accompaniment), improvisation, and audience interaction.  
  
Students will learn Storyspace, a program for creating hypertext, and  
will create and discuss their own hypertext stories and poems. The course will  
also cover opportunities for disseminating interactive literature through the 
burgeoning new field of electronic publishing. 
  
Phone or fax registration for the class is accepted until Jan. 23, in-person  
registration until Feb. 7.

From:   Steve Evans <ST001515@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU>  
Subject:  Defense of NEA  
  
In light of recent indications that the Republican  
controlled 104th Congress intends to summarily eliminate  
Federal funding for the arts, Jennifer Moxley and I have  
begun organizing an event that we would like to make  
known to the participants on this list.  
  
We are organizing in Providence, and we invite members  
of this list to organize in their cities, a  
"read-in" on Saturday, January 28th.  We are calling  
the event *Freely Espousing* and welcome the adoption by  
others of that name.  We are inviting artists, writers, 
publishers, scholars, students, and interested citizens 
to manifest their support for National Arts Funding by  
participating in a 5 hour read-in (1-6 pm EST) of materials 
partly or fully funded by the National Endowment for the  
Arts.  We are scheduling speakers at roughly the midway point 
in the reading, probably from 3-4 that afternoon.  If interest   
warrants, we will stretch both the reading and the speaking 
component of the event by several hours.  We plan to distribute  
a petition and also pre-fab postcards (probably the ones  
The Literary Network is producing) at the event.  
  
Two weeks is a mercilessly short time in which to organize an 
event, but the debate on the Balanced Budget Amendment  
(beneath which rubric we've been told the NEA-NEH's fate  
will be decided) is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, January  
24th.  If we do not act immediately, what slim chance we  
have of affecting the outcome will be entirely pre-empted.  
Indeed, the opponents of the NEA/NEH have a clear majority  
on this issue and the RI Democrats that I spoke with (including  
people at the office of Senator Pell, architect of the NEA  
legislation in 1965) seem resigned to losing the Endowment. 
The message I got was, with Social Security on the block, 
no one is  going to go to the wall for art.  
  
Jennifer and I chose *Freely Espousing* as the name for 
this event not only for its resonance in our poetic tradition,   
but also because the Republican attempt to completely bypass  
democratic procedure in their 100-day dash to the right is  
deeply offensive to us.  Indeed, although organizing and  
participating in this defense of the NEA may not save the 
program, it could be a small but important step toward de-  
legitimating Newt Gingrich's show of legislative thuggery. Our   
message should be: this assault on the arts is symptomatic of a cynical   
and despicable disregard for democracy on the part of Gingrich,  
Dole, and their followers in the House and Senate (not to mention  
the Governors).  We must oppose their secrecy with openness, their 
arrogance and greed with generosity and solidarity. 
  
Jennifer and I have had tentative discussions with people 
in San Diego and San Francisco about organizing parallel  
events on January 28th.  While it is not imperative that  
all events take place on the same day or follow the same  
program, it does lend a certain credibility (as well as 
giving local media another "angle" on their coverage) to  
be able to cite other places around the country where people  
are convened for the same purpose.  
  
If anyone reading this post has some time to spare in the 
next two weeks (or knows of someone who does but isn't on 
this list or even on the Internet), Jennifer and I would  
welcome communication either via e-mail (st001515@brownvm.  
brown.edu) or phone (401) 274-1306.  If you are willing 
to participate, but don't have the time to coordinate the 
event, let us know and hopefully we'll be able to put you 
in touch with someone where you are.  From our standpoint,  
self-organization is the best solution, but we want to  
keep communication lines open so people in one area can act 
with knowledge of what others, in other areas, are doing. 
  
While Jennifer and I share the misgivings others on this  
list have voiced about the NEA's unresponsiveness to valid  
poetic work, we believe that dismantling what should be 
further democratized is not an acceptable alternative.  The 
fight for the NEA should simultaneously be a fight to make it 
responsive to your concerns as writers, artists, and, in the  
case of the NEH, scholars.  
  
We hope to hear from some of you in the next days.  Happy New Year!

Subject:  Freely Espousing  
  
Regarding our announcement of *Freely Espousing,* 
an event in defense of the NEA to take place on   
January 28th, we can now provide names and phone  
numbers for contact persons in two West Coast cities. 
  
Craig Foltz is the San Diego contact.  His phone  
number is 1-619-291-4945.  Craig graduated from   
UCSD and is currently in the MFA program at San   
Diego State.  He co-edits a zine called )39. 
  
Kevin Magee is the San Francisco contact.  His 
phone number is 1-510-527-9485.  Kevin's book, 
*Tedium Drum,* was recently published by Lyric&.  
Kevin and his partner, Myung Mi Kim, have just 
started a monthly *Salon de Refuse* in SF and have  
been kind enough to let us build off the organization 
already in place because of their iniative.  
  
Craig and Kevin have undertaken to serve as initial 
points of contact and organization in their respective  
cities, but both could use a hand--especially from  
people in their areas with access to the Internet.  If  
you are interested, either contact them directly, or  
send a post to us and we'll put you in touch with them. 
  
We hope to have established contact people in other 
cities in the next few days.  If there is a critical  
mass of already (or *almost*) organized writers & artists 
in your area, please consider mobilizing with us on 
the 28th. 
  
Finally, we are trying to build a list of texts that  
in some way exist because of NEA monies so that people  
can begin compiling materials for the "read-in."  If  
you can take ten minutes to scan your minds and libraries 
for work that can be included on a skeleton-list of such  
texts, your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Just 
post to us off-list and we will make sure a master copy 
gets compiled and distributed to the contact people in various   
cities. 
  
Thanks to everyone and remember, Freely Espouse today or  
Forcibly Emigrate tomorrow.

X-To:   poetics@UBVMS.BITNET

Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, 1995 
3:45pm NYC time  
  
Eric Mottram died this morning in London.  Tom Raworth just phoned me, just 
while Allen Fisher was phoning Pierre Joris, both telling us that Eric had  
died four to five hours ago from multiple infections. He had been hospitalized  
a day or two ago.  
  
Eric turned 70 on this past December 29. 
  
From the introduction to *Alive in Parts of this Century: Eric Mottram at 70*,  
just out from North and South Press:  
  
"Eric Mottram is one of the most important figures of post-war literature 
and teaching.  He was the first to teach Beat writing in Europe in the 1950s, 
the first teacher of American Studies at the University of London, and a  
co-founder of the Institute of United States Studies in the University of 
London in 1963.  He edited Poetry Review in 1972-75, ran the King's Poetry  
Series in 1967-80 and co-edited The New British Poetry (1988).  He has had  
two dozen collections of poetry published since the late 1960s including  
*Elegies*, *A Book of Herne* and *Selected Poems*.  [*Selected Poems (1989) 
*Alive in Parts of This Century*, both from North and South, are available  
from Small Press Distribution.] 
 His essay collections include *The Algebra of Need*, the first essay full  
study of William Burroughs, and *Blood on the Nash Ambassador*, a selection 
of essays.  
  
An indefatigable supporter of the most adventurous, inventive, and socially 
engaged poetry of the UK and USA, Mottram introduced at least two generations 
of poets to poetry hidden from view by the a literary establishment, on both  
sides of the Atlantic that, in Mottram's words, promoted a conformist poetry  
decoration and decorum.  Mottram's own uncompromising poetry demonstrated how 
poetry can be political without sacrificing formal investigation.  As Pierre  
Joris wrote of Eric's poetry -- this is work of "gut passion, crystal clarity 
of intellect."   
  
For *Alive in Parts of This Century*, Pierre Joris chose lines (almost all) 
from Eric Mottram's work for his contribution.  (The format of the poem was 
disrupted in e-conversion; it should be flush right.)

Subject:  Re: Apex of the M 
In-Reply-To:  <199501162207.OAA22314@leland.Stanford.EDU> 
  
Dear Friends: 
I was pleased to get the most recent Apex of the M and read the poetry with 
interest but I must say I was dismayed by the manifesto "The Contextual   
Imperative," put out by the editors.  
  
Certainly, the post-language generation has every right to want to move   
in different directions--that's only logical--but the slight on the L poets 
vis-a-vis politics seems entirely misguided.  The editors write "language 
poetry, in reproducing and mimicking the methods and language of contemporary 
capitalism, ultimately commits itself to the same anonymity, alienation,  
and social atomization of the subject in history that underlie capitalist 
geo-politics."  And they go on to compare the language poets to Reagan, Bush, 
and Quayle! 
Come on now!  Ron Silliman, Barrett Watten, Bob Perelman, Charles Berstein, 
(the most "political" of the L poets) reproducing and mikcing the language  
of contemp capitalism!?  Just the opposite was/is true--these poets have  
worked very hard and put themselves on the line to break down language so 
that it couldn't function as the voice of "contemporary capitalism." 
At the same time, what about the editors?  The sentence above is 
distinguishable from capitalist geo-politics???  How can it be when it is 
a tissue of cliches.  The very phrases "contemporary capitalism," "social 
atomization" "capitalist geo-politics" are nothing but buzz words of the  
type one hears/sees on TV every minute.  Whose capitalism?  Japanese? U.S.? 
Serb?  what's it really like?  What "social atomization" precisely are we 
talking about?  And let's look at that language in, say, Silliman's work  
and read it against Quayle's and see if it really IS like that., 
  
And then what in hell is 'radical transparency"?  Literally, it means that  
language is absolutely see-through, which means what language you use  
doesn't matter because you want to get behind it to the Big Ideas.  But   
the danger of doing this is that you start spouting the language of those 
"ruling classes throughout Western history" poets are supposedly oppsing. 
  
At its best, Language poetry never valorized language "for its own sake"  
as the editors claim.  Nor is it the case that theirs is the only or 
hegemonic way of writing.  But if language poetry is to be attacked--and  
don't we have enough attacks from the dominant poetic discourses already?-- 
it had better be attacked in a more responsible way than it is here.  That  
means informing oneself about what's really going on around the globe and not 
just throwing out phrases like "Reagan-Bush" or "triumph of capital"?  If 
there's a blueprint for a new economic program let's hear what it is.  In 
specifics.  But surely, in the heyday of Newt Gingrich it's rather 
ineffectual to drop phrases like "triumph of capital".  
  
A final question: who is to read the new revolutionary poetry (what it 
will be like remains to be seen) the editors advocate?  Is poetry going to  
"deliver victims from the daily miseries inflicted by the politicians and 
the bourgeoisie?"  How is this to happen?  Certainly not via ignorance,as 
in the statement (page 7) about "wars of the West against Islam and in Asia." 
In Asia:  Does China have no responsibility for 'wars in Asia"? Japan?  and 
Islam:are the Islamic countries really just innocent victims of "the West"? 
  
I would think "revolution," poetic or otherwise, would require a little more  
analytic rigor than what we see here.

Two more cities now have contact people for  
*Freely Espousing* on January 28th. 
  
Jena Osman produced incredible results in  
Buffalo, garnering a sponsor (National Association  
of Artists Organizitions) and a site (Hallwalls   
Gallery) within about thirty minutes on a legal holiday!  
If you don't hear from Jena first, get in touch   
with her via e-mail (vz10j9vn@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu) 
or phone (716-884-2213).  
  
In Milwaukee, Woodland Pattern had already planned  
a marathon fund-raising reading for the 28th.  Bob  
Harrison is discussing with them ways of linking  
the events.  He has also agreed to be a contact person  
for Milwaukee.  His net address is Robert.A.Harrison@ 
JCI.Com.  His phone numer is 414-962-5989 (home). 
  
In San Diego, Cole Heinowitz has joined Craig Foltz 
in organizing things.  Craig's number remains the 
one to use and we are currently working on hooking  
them up with someone on the net.  
  
Two people wrote in from the vicinity of University 
of Virginia this afternoon, but neither felt they 
were in a position to organize something.  Does anyone  
have a suggestion for a contact person in or near 
Charlottesville? 
  
Several people have asked about ways to identify  
NEA recipients.  The best way Jen and I have 
found (besides gossip) is the *NEA Annual Report,*  
in book form through 1990, fiche through 1993. 
We found it in the Government Documents section   
of Brown's library (call no. NF 2.1:993).  
  
A quick scan of the 1990 awards yields many familiar  
names, including Leslie Scalapino, Susan Howe, Steve  
Benson, Jimmy Santiago Baca, Lawson Inada, and Rosmarie 
Waldrop.  Journals that received grants that year included  
o-blek, Sulfur, Five Fingers Review, Conjunctions, Tyuonyi, 
Callaloo and others.  Among the publishers there were 
Four Walls Eight Windows, Avenue B, Dalkey Archive, The 
Figures, Burning Deck.  Small Press Traffic, Seque, 
Woodland Pattern, Beyond Baroque, Small Press Distribution, 
Minnesota Center for Book Arts, and the Poetry Project in 
NYC were all granted varying degrees of organization funding. 
  
Different years of course tell different stories, and we  
have watched operations fold for lack of Endowment monies 
since 1990.  Still it's worth having a browse over the  
history if you're not already familiar with it.   
  
Right now we're working on writing a press release (never 
done that before), tracking down more precise information 
on how the Endowment will be dealt with in Appropriations,  
getting something going in DC and NYC.  If anyone can 
provide tips on any of these fronts they will be deeply 
appreciated.  We're also trying to re-write our initial 
post to this list for easy travelling on local b-boards 
etc.  
  
Thanks to everyone who has helped so far!

From:   Tom Mandel <tmandel@UMD5.UMD.EDU>   
Subject:  Re: Apex of the M 
X-cc:   tmandel@cais.com  
  
I originally began this as a private message to Marjorie Perloff, to 
tell her she'd hit the nail on the head in her comments on the Apex  
intro, meaning to quote to her what Hobbes said of Spinoza - _I durst  
not have spoke so freely_ (that's a paraphrase, source not being handy),  
being a Language Poet myself (wch when it happened to me meant being 
in a loosely-(un)defined and altogether anonymous group of abt 15-20 
folks but now means being in an altogether over-commented and 
literally undefinable crowd of ?3-500?), but have decided to make  
the comment openly, wanting to add one or two things... 
  
1. To go from the introduction of the Apex issue in question to the  
work gathered therein is an interesting study. Mostly what's in the  
issue is the work of poets in mid-career, many of whom associated  
(i.e. _are associated_) with LP -- how can this so-called manifesto  
claim them for a next or new way? 
  
2. I believe the editors must understand themselves to have chosen 
these poets in mid-career as illustrative of their (the editors')  
sense of where poetry needs to go now, as illustrative of the ideas  
in the introduction. Thus, the making of manifestos (manifesti?) 
and new movements is reduced from that of actually creating a new  
poetry to being a thoughtful editor. The surrealists too had their 
chosen forebears to bring forward (i.e. Lautreamont), but they   
were rescuing work wch had been neglected and even rejected not  
putting together a table of contents wch cd as easily have been  
found in Temblor in the late 80's (obviously, _somewhat_ different)  
or Oblek in the earlier 90's. Moreover, the relative proportion  
of forebears (a few) to active perpetrants of the revolutionary  
new poetry (a triple handful) seems more appropriate than in  
the case of Apex volume.  
  
3. Thus new tendencies in poetry as the acts of editors? Sorry,  
I don't think so. It's hard not to see in this volume a 2d  
chapter in a different town of the intentions of the editors  
of ACTS in SF who invented a term _analytic lyric_ which they 
wished to counterpose to Language Poetry, then went around  
telling everybody that this was what they wrote. I remember 
asking Benjamin Hollander (along with David Levi Strauss, the 
editor of ACTS) what the term meant. Mostly, his answer was 
that it was what I was writing! (I and others, of course - I  
don't mean they were vaunting me in particular) No thanks,  
Benjamin, I'm a language poet -- i.e. my work, wherever it  
goes and whoever it attracts the attention of, is historically   
located in that tendency. If I write rhymed couplets I'll be  
 a langpo who does so (well,... that's _a little_ over- 
simplified, tho not as much as one might think: I mean it's 
an ostensively defined term, supplemented with interpretations   
wch are motivated by a desire to see our work somehow together.  
there's little else in common between say me and say Bruce  
Andrews who is a dear, old friend and comrade, or Ron 
or Lyn; in some sense I believe we will desire our works to 
be buried in a common historical grave). 
  
4. The test of the Surrealist manifesto was the work of 
Breton, Eluard, Peret, Aragon, Desnos, et. al., not the 
validity of the ideas in the manifesto, somehow interpreted 
in the presence of some other test but absent the test of 
new work. I don't for a minute doubt the gifts or motivation  
of the poets who edit Apex. It would have been better,  
however, to place the intro before a volume of new writers  
who simply blew one away (and, gentle reader, you cannot  
imagine how intently I - and most other language poets I  
know, tho not all surely - await this experience), where  
its rodomontade, its stuffy certainties abt historical  
directions/needs, its empty rejection of the exact social 
and economic matrix which enabled it (doesn't anybody 
read the Communist Manifesto anymore? viz. its eloge of 
capitalism?) -- in such a context, all these qualities  
would be irrelevant in the face of the experience of a  
new poetry. A new poetry. We always want a new poetry.

Surely, there shd be a DC aspect to this event. I can't

so (and Mark and Joe at least are on this forum...).

Subject:  Text of Robert Duncan Selected Poems  
  
I have just finished a fairly detailed draft catalogue of 
problems, puzzles, errors, and the like of the first 44 
pages of the New Directions edition of Robert Duncan: 
_Selected_Poems_. The format of this list (14 pages in hard 
copy) is severely distorted by e-mail conversion so I cannot  
post it here. If anyone out there wants a copy, please let  
me know and I'll send it as soon as I can print one off for 
you. A couple of bucks ((on receipt) to cover xerox and 
postage is not necessary but would be helpful, especially if  
about fifty people want one.  
  
Let me point out, though, that unless we know the status  
of the copy-text, most of the "errors" I report might not be  
errors at all; I am however absolutely certain that the text  
of "For A Muse Meant" is seriously flawed, and that some of 
the dates are wrong. The textual history of  
_Medieval_Scenes_ is so complicated that it is simply 
impossible to say anything certain about the text in the  
_Selected_Poems_ of 1993, save that it agrees with that of  
_The_ First_Decade_, published in 1968. From the discussion 
in _Medieval_Scenes_1950_and_1959 (text cross-checked 
against the original Centaur Press edition, for there are 
errors in the 1978 reprint), I'm certain that it is not the 
text of 1947, and almost certain that it is not that of 
1950. 
  
The most serious error in the book, for those who don't want  
the full treatment, is the substitution of "however" for  
"hoverer" in the 8th line of "For A Muse Meant" (pp. 35-37),  
and the printing of a page-wide rule in the middle of the 
poem (towards the foot of page 36), interrupting the text in  
a nonsensical way. This is a carryover from the Jargon Press  
edition of _Letters_: the page-wide rule is at a page break;  
it separates the footnote from the body of the text. The  
stanza itself continues without a break through that line,  
so you need to close up that final line of the stanza: "a 
con glomerations without rising". 
  
 Most of the other errors are of lineation, punctuation 
and capitalisation, and so forth, with some quite seriously 
misleading dates in the table of contents. Without knowing  
what copy text was used in preparing this edition, it is  
impossible to sort out or estimate the accuracy of this 
text. New Directions, to whom I have sent this schedule,  
is no doubt gnashing its collective teeth.

Subj: Poetry on the Margin  
  
I was struck by the comment that poetry teachers should be good hosts. 
As I do with dinner guests, I try to offer my high school students 
some familiar poems but also some dishes they would never think of 
trying but so obviously related to what they know or care about that 
they taste. Slipping a little fried squid in with the shrimp. 
  
In one class where I ask students to write tabloid pieces to actual  
headlines from the Enquirer and Globe (oh, you know, RMan Glues His  
Butt Shut" and such), I slipped in a Lucille Clifton poem:  
  
them and us 
  
something in their psyche insists on elvis 
slouching into markets, his great collar 
high around his great head, his sideburns  
extravagant, elvis, still swiveling those  
negro hips. something needs to know 
  
that even death, the most faithful manager 
can be persuaded to give way  
before real talent, that it is possible  
to triumph forever on a timeless stage   
surrounded by lovers giving the kid a hand.  
  
we have so many gone. history 
has taught us much about fame and its 
inevitable tomorrow. we ride the subways 
home from the picture show, sure about   
death and elvis, but watching for marvin gaye. 
  
Poetry is just part of what we do in class. No big deal. You like this 
one, I like that one. It seldom feels difficult. Slips down like 
yellow peppers in oil.

Subj: Jrnl: Poetry on the Margins, Cont. 
  
If it's not already beaten to death, I have a small thought.  Why do 
we assume that "participation" in poetry need be writing it?  I have 
students who claim to hate poetry precisely because they cannot  
imagine ever writing it (and they frequently refuse to write about it  
because they cannot imagine writing it).  Why not participation as 
readers?  I'm a movie junkie, but that doesn't make me want to be an 
actor (or even a director); I'm deeply interested in poetry, but no  
longer write it (one less bad poet is no tragedy).  The work of  
readers is not to be despised or dismissed; for some students, the 
role of reader (and critic) is more enabling than the role of author.

Subj: RE: Poetry on the Margins 
  
Putting aside the question of whether poetry is any more on the margins   
than novels or drama, here's my two-cents-worth.  Students have more 
difficulty reading poetry (and are less likely to take poetry courses) 
because they are taught early on that they CAN'T read it.  The two main   
culprits--and words which have come to haunt me as a teacher--are Symbols 
and Themes. 
  
Ask a student (try this--I guarantee it will work), "what's the theme of  
Frost's 'The Road Not Taken'?" and he or she will tell you that the "theme" 
is that we need to dance to the beat of a different drummer (or some such 
variant), to boldly go where no man has gone before, and follow our hearts  
and be an artist.  Ask then, "and what are the symbols in this poem?" and 
the student will dutifully tell you that the Road, of course, is the main 
symbol and that it symbolizes that road in life that few people dare to   
travel, the path off the beaten track that only poets go down.   
  
Now especially since when you actually READ the poem, you discover that   
there's almost no difference between the two roads ("Though as for that,  
the passing there / Had worn them really about the same"), how do students  
come to these conclusions?  They come to them because they were told that's 
what the poem MEANS (where's Archibald MacLeish when you really need him).  
They are told over and over that poetry (in fact, all literature) must be 
reduced to some moral lesson, formulable in a sentence and that they keys 
to these formulae are symbols--mysterious words whose true meanings are   
known only to English teachers, who no doubt are given some secret Book of  
Symbols upon graduation from English Ed. programs.  Read Frost's own 
"Education By Poetry" and see what he has to say about these ideas.  
  
Even if we offer students more sophisticated versions of themes and  
symbols, we need to recognize as teachers when we are telling students what 
some thing means as opposed to allowing them to generate meanings.  In 
other words, are we supplying students with the contexts in which they can  
build their own readings of poems or are we telling them particular  
allegories of meaning without showing them the contexts and ideas that 
foster those allegories?  I think, particularly with poetry, we tell them 
the meaning and in doing so tell them the poem means something other than 
what it directly says--something they can't possibly know, because they   
can't possibly know as much as we do (about culture, about literature, 
about history, about oppression, .  .  .  you fill in the blank).  In other 
words, I think poetry highlights issues of power and interpretation in the  
classroom in ways that other genres perhaps avoid.  At the very least, 
students feel better able to read other kinds of literature.  
  
Sorry if all this sounds a bit shrill, but I needed to get it off my chest.

Subject:  Freely Espousing Update 
  
What follows is a longish post updating people on 
*Freely Espousing.*  Please refer any questions   
to us or to the Contact person nearest you (cf.   
earlier posts giving that information).  
  
WASHINGTON DC 
  
As Joe Ross hinted earlier today, and as we  
can confirm now, Washington D.C. is the sixth  
city to join in our manifestation of support 
for the NEA/NEH.  You can contact Joe at:  
202-745-0454(h), 202-416-8507(w), 202-416-8585(fx). 
His net address is jross@tmn.com.  His street  
address is 1719 S Street NW#2, Washington DC, 20009.  
  
Mark Wallace has also agreed to be a DC contact.  
His phone number is 202-637-0441(h).  His net  
address is mdw@gwis2.circ.cwu.edu.  
  
Our thanks to both Joe and Mark!  
  
The DC events will take place at Willow St. Gallery.  
Contact Joe or Mark for specifics.  
  
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE 
  
Most of you will have heard by now that the Senate  
Committee on Labor and Human Resources (Chair, Nancy  
Kassebaum, R-KS) will begin hearing testimony regarding 
the Endowment on Tuesday, January 24th.  We are told  
the Jane Alexander will testify the first day.  If you  
were putting off writing a letter to the editor, you  
may wish to draft one now so that your local paper has  
something to hand when the NEA becomes "news" next week.  
  
You may also have heard that the House Budget Committee,  
chaired by John Kasich (R-OH), is currently making  
rescisions in FY95--i.e. cutting monies from programs 
that have already been allocated funds for this year. 
Keep a very close eye on the activities of this Committee,  
which is effectively serving as Newt's assassination team.  
  
BLIND SPOTS IN OUR ORGANIZING 
  
Given the rush, it's not surprising that there remain 
a number of places around the country where support 
such as we're seeing in the six cities already organized  
(with NYC, a seventh, still a few phone calls away from 
being "in") exists but is unreachable by us. 
  
Joe Ross reminded us this morning that Texas, Ohio, and 
Georgia are KEY places in which to rally support.  Any  
suggestions on how to get something going there would 
be vastly appreciated.  Even though ten days may prove  
too short notice to bring something off on the 28th, there's  
nothing wrong with bringing something together for the following 
weekend, etc. 
  
PRESS RELEASE 
  
With the help of Kit Robinson, we have finally composed a 
press release, which we will post separately to the list. 
We recommend that Contact people download the release and 
supplement it with local information.  Of course, the 
release could also be used for re-posting to local bulletin 
boards and so forth.  Please feel free to use, alter, or  
ignore the release, depending on the complexion events are  
taking on where you're at.  
  
EXPLOITING A STEREOTYPE OR TWO  
  
I don't know about other areas, but here in Providence several   
people have shown interest in two fairly incidental points  
about this event.  1)  It is being organized by people in 
what the media call "gen x" (and not, e.g., by professional 
art bureaucrats); and (2) the Internet is involved. 
  
If it makes the difference between getting your event covered 
or not, Jen and I think you should consider playing to the  
current buzz-words on these two points.  Just a thought.  
  
ALBANY  
  
We know many people in the Eastern part of the country are  
going to be in Albany for a gathering this coming weekend.  
Neither of us will be able to make it, but we hope that 
the incredibly e-literate bunch at Albany can keep us 
posted any developments, discussions, thoughts people 
are having about *Freely Espousing* during the weekend. 
  
HERE IN PROVIDENCE 
  
An Ad-Hoc Committee of Literary Publishers, consisting  
of Burning Deck, Lost Roads, Paradigm, Tender Buttons,  
Garlic Press, and the Impercipient, should exist by 
sometime tomorrow.  Rosmarie Waldrop (Burning Deck) 
and C.D. Wright (Lost Roads) have been working hard 
with Jennifer and I to handle the local details.  
  
AND REMEMBER OUR MOTTO: FREELY ESPOUSE TODAY OR FORCIBLY  
EMIGRATE TOMORROW  
  
  
Regards to all,

 ARTISTS AND WRITERS ORGANIZE TO DEFEND NEA, NEH 
  
  Events Planned in Six Cities to Protest Attack on Arts Groups  
  
19 January 1995, Providence--In response to strong indications   
that the Republican-controlled 104th Congress intends to  
summarily eliminate federal funding for the arts and humanities  
through the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), writers, artists, scholars,  
and concerned citizens in a half-dozen American cities have organized  
*Freely Espousing,* a day of events manifesting support for public 
arts funding on Saturday, January 28, 1995.  
  
Begun on the initiative of two Rhode Islanders (the home state   
of Senator Clairborne Pell, architect of the 1965 legislation 
that created the NEA/NEH), the idea has spread quickly--partly   
through use of the Internet--to San Diego, San Francisco, 
Milwaukee, Washington D.C., Buffalo, and New York City. 
  
Providence organizers Steve Evans and Jennifer Moxley chose 
the name *Freely Espousing* to underscore the vital role of the  
arts in a democratic society and to call attention to what they  
identify as a lack of rational public debate on a host of 
issues currently being forced through Congress under the leadership  
of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob 
Dole. 
  
The centerpiece of *Freely Espousing* events throughout the 
country will be a marathon "read-in" of literary works whose  
creation the NEA has facilitated in its thirty-year existence.   
A variety of speakers and round-tables are also planned.  
  
APPEND LOCAL INFORMATION HERE / ALSO, CORRECT HEADER INFORMATION 
ABOVE (PERHAPS GIVING EVANS/MOXLEY IN PROVIDENCE AS SECOND CONTACT?)

The Electronic Poetry Center seeks to provide a central _place_  
for Internet resources for poetry and poetics.

The Center continues to provide access to the electronic poetry  
and poetics journal, RIF/T, and the archives of the Poetics List.  
Needless to say, the EPC provides quality archival materials for 
these resources. For the Poetics archive, a feature has recently 
been added to allow keyword searching for the immense number of  
files comprising this archive.  
  
The EPC author library offers texts and/or information about  
contemporary poets in a variety of formats.  
  
A number of electronic journals are archived and distributed by  
the EPC. Journals distributed through the EPC differ from other  
e-journal archives in a significant way: the texts presented here  
have been checked and verified by their issuing agency, thus at  
least getting to you versions of electronic journals that have a 
direct link to their source. We are delighted to offer these  
journals to you and will continue to make sure texts presented   
are done so in collaboration with their producers. For resources 
outside the EPC, we have written links to make seamless 
connections to these resources. It is our aim to be vigilent  
about our links so that persons interested in poetry and poetics 
do not have to spend a lot of time digging for addresses, 
remembering sites, and locating resources. Through the selections  
available at the EPC, users of the system have simple and direct 
access to many other related Internet resources.  
  
The Center also provides information about contemporary little   
magazines and small presses engaged in poetry and poetics. Since 
this information is often difficult to locate, it is presented at  
the EPC in hopes of recongizing these contributions, facilitating  
communication, and providing an additional outlet for these 
extremely valuable print sources. Look here also for Selby's List  
of Experimental Magazines.  
  
The Poetry & Poetics Document Archive provides access to a number  
of documents of use to poets, teachers, and researchers. Here you  
will find essay material and current obituaries. This area should  
be consulted in conjunction with the Poetics Files and Small  
Press Sources areas, which also offer material of pedagogical 
use.  
  
The EPC also presently offers gallery, sound, exhibts, and an 
announcements area.  
___________________________________________________________________  
  
2.0 Poetry and the Electronic Place  
  
Compared to say, a year ago, many people might agree that the 
idea of some sort of an electronic forum for poetry is not only a  
possibility but an inevitability. We have seen the continued  
growth of the Poetics List (I counted around 250 postings the 
month of December 1994 alone) and the development of the  
Electronic Poetry Center. The EPC has maintained a significant   
circulation. We regularly get letters from various world outposts  
attesting to the reality of such connectivity. Interesting also  
are the number of visits taking place, both locally and across   
distance; despite the dips and peaks that typify any active 
place, the EPC has seen a good amount of traffic across its 
doorstep. For those with such inclination (and it is illuminating  
that the following compare favorably with circulation statistics,  
say, for a little magazine) here are some numbers:  
  
_Month_   _Connects_  
Nov 1994  573  
Oct 1994  429  
Sep 1994  367  
August 1994 348  
July 1994 614  
June 1994 110  
  
These statistics give only a sense of scale, it should be noted, 
since direct connections to EPC submenus and entries through  
Veronica searches, a significant number of connects, are not  
included in the above statistics. 
___________________________________________________________________  
  
3.0 Interface: Gopher, Web, Mosaic   
  
Even as activities converge, it is also the time of divergent 
interfaces. I am often surprised by the number of our 
contributors and participants who do not even have gopher access.  
(These, again, not represented in the above statistics.) Most 
people, we figure, have at least gopher access, though Web access  
is quickly becoming a standard. Mosaic, it would be assumed,  
though assuming predominance in the University setting, has 
hardly become a reality for most dial-up users, particularly  
internationally. (For the sake of a common ground, gopher is an  
ascii-based interface that offers access through the selection of  
menus; the web is an ascii-based interface that offers access 
through _screens_ of information with links to other areas  
appearing as highlighted text; Mosaic is a graphical interface   
basically superimposed on the Web structure that offers images,  
sound, video, and allows you to use your mouse as a navigational 
tool.) The EPC is accessible through any of these interfaces. It 
is presently evolving strongly towards exclusive Web/Mosaic 
access. 
  
_Informational Notes_: (1) The standard for Web/Mosaic documents 
is the markup protocol called html. These are imbedded codes that  
you will see once in a while when you download an html document. 
These codes give instructions to the software about highlighting,  
fonts, and screen layout, as well as providing for the _hot 
links_ that make possible Web/Mosaic navigation. (2) A feature of  
these interfaces that should be mentioned is the bookmark. You   
may wish to investigate this as most systems allow you to set a  
bookmark, say at the EPC, and gain immediate access to it when   
you invoke your interface.  
___________________________________________________________________  
  
4.0 RIF/T Notes  
  
Forthcoming from RIF/T are two special issues. The first of these  
is the Transpoeisis issue (see EPC Announcements for details) 
which will offer a muti-faced and multi-format approach to the   
presentation of translations. Also forthcoming, a planned special  
issue on Charles Olson. RIF/T will also soon issue the first in a  
series of special chapbooks. Much on the way!  
___________________________________________________________________

Subject:  apex of the m...  
  
i felt i just had to weigh in here (& apologies in advance for a 
*long* post)  
  
with a sort of 'outsider's' response to marjorie's & tom's posts...  
it'll soon  
become apparent that my outside is another's inside & another's  
outside & 
  
another's inside-outside... the phenomenology is necessarily blurred,  
as are the  
borders... there's much in what both marjorie & tom say with which i 
find myself in essential agreement... but i believe there's a number 
of things 
that have gone unsaid, specifically in these regions, re this issue  
of how  
to address the (as i take it, ongoing) phenomenon of poetry, language  
  
poetry in particular (& i don't see the point any longer of hedging  
over that 
term  
---it's here to stay)... & because i'm somewhat on the margins, if 
you will, of  
this  
particular discourse as far as *my* poetics/poetry is concerned, i 
need to 
wax a bit autobiographical in order to situate my remarks some...  
  
1.  i came to poetry, formally, a little over a decade ago, deciding 
to leave  
the 
engineering profession (& "deciding" is far too genteel a term) to 
pursue  
my desire to---as i understood it then & even to some extent  
now---SAY 
something... this is a terribly atheoretical way of putting it, i  
know, but 
  
fact is, the alphabet just happened to be the technology through 
which my  
saying was to take place... by way of placing things further:  during  
approx. 
the years charles b. was penning the items in his fascinating 
collection  
_content's  
dream_, i was busy running around a brand new brewery & an aging 
pharmaceutical plant with a hardhat, safety glasses & earplugs,  
trying to 
  
resolve corrupt labor practices on the construction site & still 'get  
the 
job done,' so to speak... trial by ordeal for a young guy in his 
early 20s, as 
  
male as it may sound to say so... 
  
2. so i decided, like i say, at 29, to return to school, & under the 
able  
  
guidance of don byrd & judith johnson at suny/albany, i picked up  
my doctor of arts (yep) & hit the job market, eventually ending up a 
decade later here in chicago, at illinois institute of technology, 
teaching  
technical 
& professional writing... i bet some of you could have seen this 
coming, but i 
couldn't... anyway... point is that i get questions from my tech.  
students, even   
now,  
that conjure up my former institutional self, & set my teeth on edge 
as  
to what it is makes a writer tick... i'm still not sure i know...  
  
3.  & fact is, over the past decade, the academic job scene has  
become, as we 
all 
know, miserable... & the politics of the past decade, well... i mean,  
i came out  
of the  
early 70s... as i progressed more & more in my saying activity as a  
poet, i 
became  
more & more aware of the language poets, thanks largely to the   
liberal learning 
atmosphere at albany... in any case, the work itself, the poetry,  
struck me as  
  
incredibly difficult, strikingly different from what i had envisioned  
poetry to 
be... 
i never quite came to aesthetic terms with works such as, say, ron 
silliman's _lit_---& i take this to be a mark of my own poetic   
limitations,  
tastes, etc. (but i'll come back to this question of how to evaluate 
aesthetic 
practice)...  
at the same time, i found myself engrossed in the sorts of debates 
over poetic 
practice that (had & have) emerged from this collective enterprise, &  
although  
  
i found the work, contextually speaking, a reaction in some ways to  
the 
political 
realities of the day (this is not a political assertion per se, but  
an aesthetic  
  
assertion---& methinks one would be well-advised not to read  
political ethos  
too closely into aesthetic articulations), i nevertheless recognized 
that  
these folks were *serious* about what they were doing... & at the  
same time,  
it was clear to me that they were constructively self-conscious as to  
their respective institutional histories... they were, in all, i felt  
(& still  
feel) against the grain...  
  
4.  but the scene, the academic scene (as i've said) was getting 
tighter & 
tighter 
job-wise... & in fact that the language poets were, relatively   
speaking, fully  
theorized (if for some, theoretically overdetermined) played well in 
light of  
  
the american academic tendency toward theory... at least, this is how  
  
i read the situation, in broad strokes... hence folks like charles 
bernstein 
  
[sorry for picking on you, charles!] thankfully found their way into 
'the academy'... &, i might add, this development was long overdue...  
  
5. but my 'initiation,' if you will, into the community of language  
poets---& 
i'll  
refrain from speaking in terms of  'generation' & the like, & by 
'initiation' i   
mean simply acquaintance/friendship & the like---didn't really   
come until march 1993, at the new coast conference... my colleague & 
friend here 
  
andrew levy had been invited to speak, so i decided (again!) to  
attend to 
promote 
my own little venue.... there i stood during the day, my kinko-green 
sheets in 
hand  
(as some of you may recall), trying to get participants interested in  
my  
electronic  
writing collective, *nous refuse* (juliana spahr & i had discussed 
the 
electronic  
stuff electronically prior to the conference)... i found the general 
tenor of  
the conference, at the time, extremely exclusive at times... that is,  
i felt my 
  
place in the proceedings marginal at best, & i found the overarching 
discourse,  
  
what with presumptions as to a 'new coast," downright presumptuous...  
  
in retrospect, this was a somewhat hasty judgement, to the extent  
that many 
  
folks at that conference knew each other, had shared histories,  
whereas i had no 
reason to expect these folks---strangers initially---to understand 
either me,  
say,  
or my electronic orientation ipso facto... but there was, i'll   
maintain, an  
(unintended)  
air at the conference, to one such as me, of self-importance---not 
perhaps 
  
entirely without warrant, but perhaps a bit off-putting initially to 
other sorts 
of aesthetic orientations... i mean, one can't be all things to all  
people, but 
then, i thought, just who were these people? (many of whom were a  
good deal 
  
younger than me, albeit no less equipped to discuss their craft)...  
  
6.  before i entirely alienate many of you out t/here, i wish to 
state as  
  
clearly as possible that the thing that's really struck me since 
march '93 
has been the *generosity* of the folks i met at buffalo, thereby 
invalidating  
my hasty evaluation as to 'exclusivity' & the like, at least in  
personal terms   
... near everybody i met there, & have since met, who are linked in  
some  
way with that group (if i may) has been extremely interested in  
discussing &  
promoting poetic practice---alternative, mainstream, what have you...  
sometimes 
  
the discussions are heated, yes---but this need not be a sign of 
agon, simply of  
  
commitment... i've found the group in general to be among the most 
tolerant & supportive around when it comes to appreciating aesthetic 
diversity,  
whatever one's "taste" (& no, i don't wish to neutralize this latter 
category, 
  
simply to bracket it for a moment)... in fact it might be argued that  
this  
(now somewhat academically centered) group is far more tolerant than 
most academic press poetry groupings... i'll leave this latter   
speculation to   
  
this list's collective imagination... 
  
7. but ysee, now that i've discussed Personalities-Writ-Large, as it 
were  
(hopefully in the process avoiding any unnecessary vitriole from 
whatever quarter, incl. mine) i need to come back to this issue of 
aesthetic practice---not 'vs. political practice,' not even 'as  
informed  
by political practice'---i wanna talk aethetics as such for a moment,  
and 
bracket 
for a change---not the social, but the political per se... i can't 
hope to lay 
out 
parameters here---this is not what i'm about, in any case... & i'm 
with tom  
as to the necessity of practicing what (& mebbe AS) you preach... but  
at the  
  
meta-level, anyway: what i see the need for at the moment is less  
manifesto 
  
(& this reverses my sentiments of a coupla years back) & more a  
discussion, in   
critical terms, of how to situate the artist/poet amid this 
increasingly  
academic environs... what is the purpose of poetry in shaping even,  
for example,  
the 
*poetic* part of one's world?... i'm a persistent promoter, on the 
one hand, 
of things electronic, & i might even be heard to drone on 
occasionally as to 
the more existential or pleasure-based or non-utilitarian value of 
the 
various pursuits in which i indulge myself... on the other hand, it's  
lost  
on me not for a nanosecond that this text, & those prompting it, come  
  
to you-us courtesy of our postsecondary institutions (similar such 
entities  
being 
where *most* of you are no doubt currently locating your corporeal & 
ethereal  
  
selves)... along these lines, i'm reminded of charles' superb piece  
in alh last 
year, 
"what's art got to do with it?" etc... we need *more* such work, 
motivated by  
such concerns... 
  
8. perhaps we need more poetry too, a new poetry, as tom indicates, &  
  
despite whatever modernist misgivings i---we each---may have...  
  
9. but perhaps, as well, situating the artist/poet as a member of a  
specific  
  
ecological or ontological or intellectual sect is somewhat less  
important 
than shaping new discourses---poetic-critical hybrids, creoles, what 
have you--- 
the point being that *all* forms of code-switching & mutating should 
be  
  
explored... & explored with at least some consideration given as to  
why one 
would wish to so explore as well as where one is, institutionally  
speaking, 
while 
exploring (& as michael joyce from the hypertext world would be quick  
to  
point out, *constructing*)... what is the value of the alphabet in a 
world such  
as ours, such as ours is becoming?... & what do we do (if this is not  
too 
naive a question this late in the 20th. century) with the more oral  
basis 
for poetry, the idea of poetry 'readings'?... perhaps we need a  
better  
collective  
sense as to the history of readings of this latter variety, as   
opposed to the   
  
currently more popular tendency to read critical reception as a  
writing 
enterprise (?)... is this a political issue, strictly speaking (& i  
have the  
debates over literacy fluttering around in my head as i write this,  
as well as  
talk of 
discursive hegemonies of one sort or another), or is recourse to 
politics here merely one way of avoiding sustained discussion of the 
value 
of a specific aesthetic dimension? (& again, not that i wish to avoid  
either  
ideology  
or politics per se)... 
  
10. & as to politics per se, & given the very real & recent concern  
evident in  
these regions as to the status of aesthetic practice in general in 
american  
society:  
perhaps we need to work harder to convince folks outside of our more 
individualistic aesthetic pursuits that, whatever this our contested 
site, it's  
not a luxury...

Have you heard from anyone  in L.A. about a *Freely Espousing* event 
here?  If not, I don't know if I could put one together 
single-handedly...but it might be  worth a shot.  This is not really a 
big town for poetry, as you might expect.  But there are reading spaces,  
and there are poets (tho mostly the type that relate their bouts with  
bad drugs or bad dates).  If someone else is doing an 
event, I'd be glad to help.  If not, I'll do what I can.

In-Reply-To:  <199501191903.AA27218@panix2.panix.com> 
  
The Apex if it's M exhibits the superficies of the dialectic and boy is   
the thesis the. But the seeds of the M in the L are multiple while the 
interpretation of the seeds by the M is faulty but understandable. The 
quotation which I have overused from Wittgenstein helps my explanation.   
"If we speak of a think, but there is no object that we can point to,  
there, we may say, is the spirit."  
  
Those objectless things in the L include, but are not limited to, vaguely:  
  
-the sign: the signified is not the thing, but the idea of the thing,  
-the body which is a constantly referenced thing but sex in most of the L 
is skirted to a spirit of the body by both the French and the L, and 
-Language itself which is constantly reified by the L writers;   
  
and also create the hook by which the M writers can attach to L and attack. 
That these things are misinterpreted by the M writers need not be  
disputed to thwart the attacks by the L writers. They are the places 
where we have left openings for the next generation of artists. That the  
M takes unfair advantage of these ideas doesn't matter either,   
misinterpretation has already been valorized by the L.  
  
The attacks by the M writers are particularly galling, but again 
represent the same tactic used by the L writers on the previous  
generation of NY School and Beat writing, although the M writers are less 
substantive in their attacks on the L than the L was on NY, but isn't  
that what the M is saying, so at the very least they are consistent. 
  
The sad parts of the issue for me are the lack of recognition of these 
facts by the L and the unconsciousness of the M writers about the openings  
which they have left to be eviscerated by not only the next generation of 
writers whom we can conveniently dub... the Nth. They will rue the day 
they used the word spirit in their fashion when it is used to attack 
their right to write as they write. For that reason, the most 
egregious and annoying part of the M is how they have forgotten the  
lessons of the enlightenment exposing the weakness of spiritual  
allegiances and its institutions. But I guess we have to "pay to keep  
from going through all this twice."

  Dear jennifer & Steve-- What about Philadelphia? When I lived there   
  (1986-1992) we had gotten a pretty interesting scene together, most   
  of whom seem to be gone now or at least not on line. There's Perelman 
  who is on line, but he's probably too busy with school. Ditto no doubt  
  for DuPlessis. maybe Gil Ott, is he still sick. Or Julia Blumenreich. 
  I could senf you there mail (not email) addresses. Valerie Fox of the 
  magazine 6ix is now in Japan. There's Mossin and the TO crowd but they're 
  more aesthetes than politicos it seems. My friend Dave baratier just  
  moved to phila. and edits pavement saw magazine there--If anybody, I  
  would suggest him. Of course, just over the river in CAMDEN is Lamont 
  Steptoe, black vietnam vet poet who used to run readings at the Painted 
  Bride but now works at the Walt Whitman Ctr. and he would probably be 
  a very good connection for you in terms of the NEA. I have a phone #  
  again but no email. Does anybody else know anything about Phila.????  
  There's Eli Goldblatt. (Charles Alexander probably has his address. I 
  lost it) at (is it) Villanova?  
  For PENNSYLVANIA may be a crucial state as well, Jen & Steve, especially  
  with the new conservative senator replacing Woffod (though I'm not mourning 
  the loss of its conservative democrat governor CASEY to a conservative  
  repub. etc.). Wofford not Woffod. Anyway, just to send this along in lieu 
  of being able (i think) to do anything here in (sm)allbany. Chris Stroff.

Subject:  NEA Enemy Action  
  
In defending and rallying round the NEA it could be useful to 
distinguish the underlying Republican impulse from some of the   
straw men that are trotted out for the bonfire. I heard 
recently of a meeting involving Gingrich financial backers in 
which it was clear their objections were not to Mapplethorpe  
and other well-known NEA headline "scandals" (much as these are  
useful ammunition in appealing to fellow conservatives). What 
really sticks in their craw is their belief the NEA is  
promoting multiculturalism at the expense of "American" 
culture. Implicit and explicit is their view that the latter is  
qualitatively superior. (I have to resort to reference like 
"the latter" since "what means American if not multicultural?"   
seems so obvious to me, but you can let your imagination run  
wild with what it means to an angry white male.)  
  
What can we do with this information? Use it to build a broader  
base of support for the NEA by appealing to multicultural 
constituencies, undercutting elitism-based arguments and  
drawing the debate away from kinkiness that so frightens  
moderate politicians.

IN James Sherry's post he rightly sees the apexers critique cum  
rejection of the Language poets in a continuum with the LP's  
treatment of the generation preceding. Surely, it is true that   
this need to get this seemingly pervasive presence out of the 
way, so to clear a space to write, afflicts or at least affects  
any generation. I don't like it, but it makes sense to me; I  
can even see it as a strength of character.  
  
There remains the question of what is done in this cleared space,  
and by whom.  
  
I'm not sure I understand the first 1/3d of James' post, unless  
he is beginning to list the features of Language Poetry that he  
sees as taken over by the Apex of the M group. If so, I'm 
interested to read a more lengthy treatment of that. Of these 
non-thing objects. 
  
The influence on some Language poets of the NY school is also 
undeniable, esp. on the early work of Charles Bernstein, Kit  
Robinson, Steve Benson, Tom Mandel, and others.   
  
The intellectual rigor of Language theory is also as open to  
critique as the intro to the Apex volume which lurks behind 
this discourse (smugly, non-dislodged, I think). You have 
only to read the banner and statement of intentions in the  
early Language magazines (w/ =, etc.) to find yourself in 
an ill-stirred pudding of the Whorf-Sapir thesis, an utterly  
misconceived version of the speech/language distinction in  
(oh what's his name; the swiss linguist's lectures - I really 
am losing my grip if I can't remember his name... and I can't!), 
and other sinking suspensions. But, this in no way excuses  
the Apex intro, does it?  
  
All the same, I'm not sure there're any definite _lessons of  
the enlightenment_ which must be held onto, but James will  
have expected my disagreement in that matter. I am an utterly 
secular person (that is, I cd _describe myself_ as _an  
utterly spiritual person_), and in some sense I like the  
world I live in (less and less). But I'm afraid I must  
say that the secularizing of the world over the last 500  
years has not pluralized the world, not at all. Just different   
and even more baleful idols being worshipped. And it is 
a pluralizing, call it a creolizing if you want, of our 
world is all can save it. Purity cults, even my favorite  
one the Pharisees, have demonstrated their horrendous 
effects over and over, and theese are magnified and 
multiplied in a world of weapons and media with such  
powers to make a hell of difference.  
  
Finally, if, as in the Apex intro I find so appalling, the  
poet is to be an iconoclast, she will have to knock over  
an idol and smash it. Another poet is a poor choice to  
begin.

I am curious about that phoenix in Tanya Manning's message. 
  
What does the phoenix mean by the sentence: "I am woman!"?  
I have heard it before, in some pop song, I think, and elsewhere, but  
I have a real curiosity here. 
I can understand, say, "I am a woman."   
Or "I am the woman." 
Or "We are women." 
Or "I am French."  
  
?

Congressional Phones, Faxes and - Sometimes - Email Addresses, as of 1/12/95  
  
The following *only* lists U.S. Senate members - all of 'em.  The list for  
the House of Representatives is so large that I'll leave it for those who 
desire it to fetch from the several sites that have been cited in this and  
recent GovExcesses.  However -- 
  
The *next* GovAccess - much shorter than this one - will give the  
email-addrs of those relatively-few Senate *and* House Congress-creatures 
who have eaddr and reportedly accept public email ... at least from their 
state/district constituents.

Subject:  Re: NEA Enemy Action  
In-Reply-To:  <199501200729.AA25307@panix.com> 
  
I too would support Alan Bernheimer's approach to creating extended  
constituencies both for supporting NEA and for breaking down the petty 
fiefdoms which have grown up in the arts, especially non-profit arts,  
over the past decades. The appeal might also be to attack elitism in the  
for profit arts which will both confuse the issue and focus the point of  
the artists for social production as opposed to artists for commodity  
production, a fight which we have been waging for decades also.  
  
But the real issues are I think not those which Alan raises, although  
they are the public ones. The real issues are twofold and come from  
different consituencies.  
  
1. When I worked for Hearst Corp. a few years ago, their beef was that 
the government was funding small presses to be able to compete against 
them and that was unfair to the for profit presses. Why should Sun & Moon 
and Greywolf, etc. be allowed to compete unfairly against William Morrow  
and Avon? (Obviously they are not the same market, but that argument does 
not convince the "shelf-space" conscious marketeers who are threatened by 
any kind of alternative as competition.) I think the same argument is at  
the root of the corporate attacks on NEA and holds true for public 
broadcasting as well.  
  
2. The other constituency that is attacking the NEA is the right.  
Originally their attention was galvanized by the body oriented art that   
received so much publicity, but their real concern is that NEA is not  
funding their art. They are not represented. I think if a painter of 
Elvis on Velvet from North Carolina were funded and publicized that a lot 
of this constituency's opposition will disappear. 
  
I don't make these points to discourage coalition building that Alan 
suggests, I simply think the real (indefensible) anxieties of the  
attackers needs to be addressed in addition to coalition building. 
Perhaps some of the more astute political organizers can suggest the 
route to coalitions that can be effective. 
  
Finally, I think the big entertainment money support of NEA will save it  
or kill it. Pell's argument that it's either NEA or Social Security tells 
a lot about what even the more liberal in Congress really think and the   
falsity of their polarizing. Alas.

It's true, of course, as Tom Mandel says, that every generation needs to  
clear a space for itself and that the Language poets, as James Sherry  
points out, did the same thing to the NY poets of the previous   
generation. And Frank O'Hara and company did it to T. S. Eliot (God save  
us from fisher kings!").  
Still, there's an air of implosion about this latest "manifesto."  For 
one thing, the language poets were attacking an Establishment, but it's   
hardly the case that today the L poets ARE the establishment.  Most people  
around the country still consider them upstarts if they've so much as  
heard of them.  Let's get real. 
Secondly, if you want to launch a line of attack, you must have an 
articulated position.  "Violence and precision" as Marinetti put it.  It  
needn't be totally coherent--and I agree that the Language manifestos of  
the 70s were hardly argued through--but you have to stand for something   
that's then visible in the poetry itself.  I just don't see this "change" 
in Apex of the M.  The poets printed therein take for granted that poetry 
is written in free verse (or prose) for starters.  It's a given.  The  
rejection of a "high style" is another given.  And so on.  That leaves 
the manifesto with saying, more or less, we're more against capitalism 
than the Language poets were and, at that level, the rhetoric fizzes out  
because the L poets in question had/have a particular Marxist position 
and carried it through.  Ron Silliman, after all, was editor of the New   
Socialist Review.  So if the editors of Apex don't share that position,   
but feel Capital is the source of all evil, I'd like to know what they 
propose to do to fight capital.

Subject:  More Espousing  
  
To those of you doing freely espousing gigs around the country:  
  
My name is Ted Pelton and I was an NEA recipient in fiction this past year. 
 I was in touch this morning with Alexander Ooms at the NEA and he faxed me a 
list of some 250 well-known recipients of fellowships.  If you want to 
contact him directly, his number is 202-682-5731.  Unfortunately the NEA  
doesn't have email (they are so wasteful with their current budget, I guess). 
 He's a friendly sort who I don't think would mind giving a 15 minute rap 
about where they stand right now or faxing you info like he did me.  He says  
the current feeling is the fight could go either way, with a lot depending on 
how the hearings went yesterday and today with the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting (no word yet -- he's going to keep me posted).  But, if not the  
full list, let me list some names which may be of interest to poetics  
subscribers from the NEA grantee names he sent me:  
  
Walter Abish, Rodolfo Anaya, Bruce Andrews, Paul Auster, Amiri Baraka, 
Jonathan Baumbach, Charles Bernstein, Ted Berrigan, John Berryman, Mei Mei  
Berssenbrugge, Paul Bowles, T. Corahessan Boyle, David Bromige, Rosellen  
Brown, Charles Bukowski, Ana Castillo, Lorna Cervantes, Sandra Cisneros,  
Lucille Clifton, Andrei Codrescu, Clark Coolidge, Robert Coover, Robert   
Creeley, Diane DiPrima, Stuart Dybek, Louise Erdrich, Clayton Eshleman,   
William Gaddis, Dagoberto Gilb, Allen Ginsberg, Nikki Giovanni, Spalding  
Gray, Marilyn Hacker, Joy Harjo, Michael Harper, Lyn Hejinian, Linda Hogan, 
Fanny Howe, Charles Johnson, Janet Kauffman, Jamaica Kincaid, Maxine Hong 
Kingston, Galway Kinnell, Denise Levertov, Jackson MacLow, Carole Maso, Harry 
Mathews, Bharati Mukherjee, Fea Myenne Ng, Alice Notley, Peter Orlovsky, Joel 
Oppenheimer, Maureen Owen, Ron Padgett, Grace Paley, Robert Pinsky, Francine  
Prose, Carl Rakosi, Ishmael Reed, Donald Revell, Kenneth Rexroth, Alberto 
Rios, Kit Robinson, Leslie Scalapino, Ntozake Shange, Leslie Marmon Silko,  
Ron Silliman, Charles Simic, Jane Smiley, Ted Solotaroff, Gilbert Sorrentino, 
Gary Soto, Ronald Sukenick, James Tate, Paul Violi, Anne Waldman, Rosmarie  
Waldrop, Alice Walker, David Foster Wallace, Lewis Warsh, Bruce Weigl, Hannah 
Weiner, Marianne Wiggins. 
  
This is meant as a list to help people, but let me apologize for any 
exclusions (good NEA-winning writers left off -- I'm sorry).  The NEA press 
release highlights the most visible authors; Ooms then threw in some more 
experimental writers he knew off the top of his head.  Then I selected names  
I knew from this hodgepodge of names.  And, to top it off, I'm a fiction  
writer; names of other fiction writers are more familiar to me than poets.  
  
Nonetheless, it's an impressive list.  Many are older names, reminding us 
that the NEA came into existence in the 60s, but also that they gave out a  
lot more awards then, and the amount actually could buy you a year to write.  
 Fewer awards at a sum that hasn't been adjusted for inflation -- this makes  
me think that after we win this battle (I think we will), we should keep the  
pressure on to fund the arts at a rate more consistent with what's spent  
elsewhere.  The current NEA budget is 64 cents per U.S. citizen.  Canada and  
france each spend 32 dollars per, and Germany 27 dollars.  The NEA itself 
makes a good case for more money, but there's no little grass roots support.  
 Quoting from their press release:  
"Every dollar awarded by the NEA attracts $11 from state and local arts   
agencies, corporations, foundations, businesses and other private entities. 
 The not-for-profit arts create $37 billion in economic activity and suppost  
1.3 million jobs.  They also return $3.4 billion to the Federal Treasury  
through income taxes, 20 times the budget of the NEA."  
  
While I'm uncomfortable with this kind of language (support arts because it's 
profitable), I think it can be turned to our advantage more than it is 
currently.  In other words, if this is the language that's being spoken, and  
it shows us off well, we might as well learn to manipulate said language to 
our own benefit.  Will this deprive us of counter-languages?  In the 
short-run, perhaps; but in the long run it could turn to our benefit.  How do 
you feel about being a state-supported artist?  Well, that's a question we  
have to answer each for ourselves.  But if we want the endowment, we should 
also want to use the best terms to make it strong within the framework that's 
most successful. 
  
Sorry for the digression.  I'd like to thank Steve Evans and Jennifer Moxley  
for getting this ball rolling.  I live in a small city, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, 
and was lamenting not being able to get something like this together here.  
 But then word came in about the Milwaukee gathering.  They're only an hour 
away, but I found out about it on-line.  This was an insight into the new 
technological geography for me.  I like it.

We're working on a more exhaustive update  
to be posted tomorrow, but Ted Pelton's  
recent post seques nicely with the fact  
that Joe Ross has gotten Alexander Ooms  
to speak at Freely Espousing-DC.  
  
We also have a new & improved Press Release  
(courtesy of Diana Cantu's expertise) which  
we will be happy to fax to you upon request. 
  
Cities we currently have initial leads in  
now include Seattle, Portland, Philadelphia  
(thanks to Chris Stroffolino for the open  
post on that one), and Wilmington/Charlotte, 
North Carolina.  If anyone has scoop on those  
communities, please e-mail us (or: make a  
few exploratory calls of your own and then 
let us know what you've found). 
  
Finally (for now): we want to encourage  
anyone who is not able to attend Freely  
Espousing to compose a statement that can  
be worked into the various programs across 
the country.  We're exploring the possibility  
of having Net-links at some of the events, 
but short of that we'd at least like to have 
virtual participation along with the palpable  
participation.   
  
More shortly.

When I mentioned that we L poets critiqued the NY school  
I did not go on to say, as I shd have but didn't want to  
take the time to, that in fact our reaction was _not_ 
against them, nor against the New Am. Poets, but against  
the devitalizing and de-authorizing and de-pressing 
movement in conventional postwar american verse, e.g. 
the Wm. Stafford school with its endless white male 
middleclass and most often academic epiphanies of 
symbolic yet private experience, so small ever so 
small so heart's needle small and yet so important  
ever so important so much something they at the   
center of the universe were doing for everyone;   
_I did it for all of us_ as Stafford puts it 
somewhere. Not for me buddy. No thanks.  
  
Stafford died earlier this year, having devoted most  
of more than eighty years life to poetry. I don't 
like his work one bit. So what. My opinion, and even  
my critique, is an unproductive fact in the face of 
his work (which was his life). The only effective 
counterpoise I can make to work I reject is *my own 
work*, my own commitments, and beyond that some way 
that I may intend deeply that they create a community 
which does not present itself as a symbolic order 
in place of social life but an example of social  
life modeling itself as in the making. That *is*  
a counterpoise.

This, I think, is exactly right. I've heard this argument made against 
all manner of nonprofits, quite aggressively, up to and including public  
schools and libraries. (Jack Shoemaker used to complain bitterly about 
how libraries reduced the need to sell individual copies of a book. As 
someone who didn't even know about bookstores until I was 15 or 16, I  
always thought that was nuts.)

Wrong on this one, James. George Dukmejian (whose last name I think I  
just butchered), back when he was governor of California, made a very  
pointed effort to appoint fellow Armenians to every single commission in  
California. So his "painter" on the Cal. Arts Commission was a woman 
from Long Beach who did watercolors of battle ships. It made no  
difference. 
  
By the way, folks, the right is also currently blasting Stanford for 
spending $1 million+ on the archives of Allen Ginsberg. (His membership   
in NAMBLA is their main point.) So there will be a focus on censorship 
at the opening of his archives on February 10. Marjorie Perloff, Carl  
Rakosi, Ginsberg, Nancy Peters (editor at City Lights) & your humble 
servant will be on one panel. Kathleen Sullivan (the law professor & 
wife of the former mayor of SF, Joe Alioto) is doing something else (I'm  
not sure what). And Allen's reading.  
  
Feb. 10 at Stanford. I'm sure Marjorie's got the details.

As usual, I feel as if I am blindly shooting into an argument that I know 
nothing about, not having read any of the apex manifestoes and only  
having scanned briefly all previous postings on this subject. 
 However, it seems to me as if someone needs to say the stupidly 
obvious and that is that every revolution, including any poetry that 
pretends to be fully fulfilled revolutionary poetry, is written in 
language. 
 This point, an admittedly stupid point, I think is important  
when you realize how many revolutions have failed due tothe fact 
that they are indeed, simply a revolution of the existing social 
structure, a kind of endlessly self-fulfilling Hegelian loop that  
we don't seem able to get around. 
 For instance, I remember this guy Mike I used to work with at 
Taco Bell and he hated the manager for her petty and often cruel 
treatment of employees. He began a systematic, and I always thought  
very intelligent campaign to discredit her in the fact of the owner. 
After many highly entertaining confrontations, he was able to get her  
fired. Of course, as I'm sure is already apparent, he was then named the  
manager and after an agonizing, I mean you could see it on his face  
a lot of the time, three months, he began to do the same things the person  
he so hated did before him. Simple, easy, maybe too easy, but the point   
is that you cannot change the particulars of any culture without changing 
the way if functions.  
 You can't have a revolutionary poetry that says I am revolutionary   
and therefore I am going to write about coal miners in the language  
of coal miners etc. Transparency doesn't exist in the poetic context.  
 It seems to me that Language Poetry is a neccessary, but certainly   
not final step towards a revolutionary poetry because it takes as its  
project the subversion of language. I don't know anywhere else to start.  
 It doesn't end here, of course, but any revolutionary poetry that is 
going to succeed Language Poetry, and that will inevitably have to happen,  
will have to take into account its achievements, as well as its problems. 
 Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

I'm outside both the traditional academic and literary poetry circles. 
Until Joe Amato introduced me to the work of the Language Poets, I'd never  
heard them.  I like Joe's work (that's why I publish it), but my 
longest-lasting literary affections lie with "movement" poets, primarily  
feminist and/or African American and/or war veteran writers who see  
themselves and their work as inseperable from their politics and their 
activism. My perspective on the whole _apex of the m_ debate is shaped by a 
general distrust of manifestos which seem to be substitutes for action, or  
which are taken *as* actions in and of themselves.  I'd like to respond to  
some of eric pape's comments in that spirit: 
  
>every revolution, including any poetry that 
>pretends to be fully fulfilled revolutionary poetry, is written in  
>language.  
  
I am not sure that this is true.  In extremity, language is a luxury that 
many cannot afford.  Violent revolutions (and perhaps most acts of physical 
violence) are *not* written--that is specifically what makes them violent;  
pens are *not* swords, however much the revolutionary (or reactionary) poet 
might wish that they were, might yearn to make language strike like a blow. 
My particular critical speciality is "literature of trauma"--specifically,  
the literature of "survivors" of man-made violence (Holocaust, combat, rape,  
etc.)--and I have found that a characteristic spanning every literature of  
trauma which I have yet uncovered is the agonizing tension between the 
failure of language ("You *can't* understand!") and the desperate need for  
language to suceed (You *must* understand!).  Revolutionary poets yearn to  
write with such strength that their audience is traumatized as they have  
been traumatized (Jones/Baraka raging that "poems are bullshit unless they  
are/ teeth or trees or lemons piled/ on a step," wanting his own poem to be 
a machine gun, reduced to helpless ratatatting; the anger is real, the 
danger *behind* the poem is real, but the *poem* can never be real in the 
sense Baraka desires it to be). 
  There was, last year, a lengthy discussion of "terrorist" poetics/poetry  
on the TNC list--some of you will remember.  It seems to me that both  
"terrorist" and "revolutionary" poetry are impossible constructions unless  
one is talking about them as documentary (at one remove) rather than actual 
(the thing itself).  Soldiers who write or talk about combat state 
unequivocally that language fails to describe their experience.  Yet every  
soldier who writes or talks about combat says *something*--uses language in 
*ways* that fail, though he/she uses it all the same.  There are qualities  
of "revolution" which lie outside of language--the violence that language 
can describe in the before and the after, but never at the now. The realm of  
the traumatic event is *silence,* speechlessness, a breach in the narrative,  
a space for which there are no words or explanations or stories:  THIS ISN'T  
SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING!  Narrative constructions come later, to explain,  
to rationalize, to describe "what happened," but they can never represent it  
properly, since its nature and impact are derived from the fact that trauma 
is *un*representable.  There are some truths which cannot be conveyed, some 
instances in which "only being is believing."  
  
>It seems to me that Language Poetry is a neccessary, but certainly  
>not final step towards a revolutionary poetry because it takes as its

The subversion of language is certainly the project of poets like Audre   
Lorde (whose description of language as "the master's tools," and whose   
position as the Sister Outsider make even her *use* of language and the   
poetic form  subversive) and Margaret Atwood and Monique Wittig, and so on. 
But these feminist poets are not considered (I believe) to be connected to  
the Language Poets. Nor are they given much serious attention by either the 
literary or academic establishments (dismissed as "political"--and therefore  
possessing an "agenda"--as lesbian, as feminist). I am asking, as an 
outsider myself, the honest question:  what is subversive about what the  
Language Poets? What is the distinction between the sort of subversion 
practiced by Lorde, for example, and various Language Poets?  
  
> You can't have a revolutionary poetry that says I am revolutionary  
>and therefore I am going to write about coal miners in the language 
>of coal miners etc. Transparency doesn't exist in the poetic context. 
  
Sometimes I think that we don't *see* poetry when it *is* transparent.  We  
don't usually look very carefully at what coal miners are doing... or what  
disfranchised black ghetto kids are doing... or what working class women are  
doing...  Some of the strongest and most "revolutionary" American poetry is 
spouted by kids at house parties, and used-to-be-kids who now have recording  
contracts with major record labels.  Ice-T *is* a poet, though you might not  
much like what he's doing (I do).  Ice-T is writing poetry about 
revolution--even if it is not revolution itself--and at least the *poetry*  
is being televised (hey, Gill Scott-Heron has a new album out, did you 
hear?).  Black Entertainment Network rap programming and "Yo! MTV Raps" are 
pretty interesting.  
  
Which brings me back around to the _apex of the m_ intro, which I haven't 
read, but have now read *about* at length.  It seems to me that one can't be  
revolutionary without being clear what one is *for* and what one is  
*against*, and without being willing to put one's body on the line for one's  
beliefs. (Revolution is risky.)  In a culture where a poet can be taken out 
and shot for writing a protest verse, it makes sense to talk about 
"revolutionary" poets.  In *this* culture, it might even make sense to talk 
about *some* poets that way.  But it's real hard for me to swallow the 
notion of "revolutionary" poets who live in relative comfort and are not  
actively engaged in taking physical risks to participate in social or  
political movements.  Maybe I'm just a hard-line kinda gal, but I like to 
save the word "revolutionary" for times when I really *mean* it....

Subject:  Re: apex of the m...  
  
i'd like to suggest a reading experiment (hat tip to chas b.'s   
"writing experiments") in re _apex of the m_: begin reading on   
page 9--an excerpt frm ed dorn's "langue d'oc around the cloc"-- 
and read thru or around in the following 168 pages... & form  
an opinion ov the work presented.  then, & only then (if you  
want), go back and read the introduction.  how is your opinion   
of the contents changed?  
  
ov course, this is a sham--even if you don't read the intro 
first, you've read the various comments here, & have those in 
mind.  & my comment--the screed that passes for an introducion   
is even more vitrolic than the intro to AotM #1; despite that,   
the issues raised are (to my mind) important ones, and worth  
addressing--and not just defending against.  
  
yes, my proposed re-vision of the work-as-a-whole is a reading   
that is _not_ the reading intended by the editors... defer to 
their intended reading if you prefer.  fr m'self, i learn several  
thangs (so far)--i enjoyed much of the work presented (chris  
stroffolino, susan thackery, & peter gizzi among others,1st 
time thru); i'm still unable to appreciate jerome rothenberg's   
work, despite being sympathetic to his stated poetics; the  
work seems to me to be various & assorted, some better than 
others, but none of it "revolutionary"; and finally: i _can't_   
find the connection between th intro and th work.  that might 
well be my failing as a reader.  it might also be a failure 
of vision, self-perception, or articulation of the editors--  
this assuming that the intro is the work of the editors, tho  
it is unsigned...  at anyrate, reaction so far has seemed to be  
reaction to the intro, rather than the work-as-whole--3 pages 
out of 176. 
  
praps the "problem" is one of perspective.  one editor confided  
in me that one impetus was a collective tiredness with poor 
imitations of Language poety--something you might well tire of   
(as tiresome as poor plath imitations, or bukowski imitaitons),  
especially if yr in the relatively narrow confines of a particular 
graduate program.  but in the rest of the world, we've never heard 
of l=a=n=g=a=g=e, let alone tired of it; while others with an 
personal investment might feel their own bastions under attack.  
i dunno--it hardly seems like getting worked up over, there's 
so little at stake...

From Freely Espousing Headquarters: 
  
A slightly punchier version of our press release is

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
January 20, 1995 
Contact: Steve Evans  401-274-1306  
  
  
  ARTISTS & WRITERS ORGANIZE NATIONAL DAY OF ACTION 
 TO DEFEND NEA, NEH  
  
  Events Planned in Seven Cities to Protest  
 Attack on the Arts   
  
  
Writers, artists, scholars, and concerned citizens in more than  
a half-dozen American cities have organized *Freely Espousing,*  
a day of events in support of public arts funding on Saturday,   
January 28th, 1995.  Marathon readings, exhibits, and other 
activities are being planned in response to threats that the  
new 104th Congress intends to slash federal funding for the 
arts and humanities provided through the National Endowment 
for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities 
(NEH).  
  
Initiated by two Rhode Islanders--RI Senator Clairborne Pell was 
the architect of the 1965 legislation that created the NEA/NEH-- 
the idea for a day of protest spread quickly across the Internet 
from Providence to New York City, San Francisco, Milwaukee, San  
Diego, Buffalo, and Washington D.C. 
  
Providence event organizers Steve Evans and Jennifer Moxley say  
"we chose the name *Freely Espousing* in order to underscore the 
vital role of the arts in a democratic society.  It is important 
to call attention to the lack of rational, public debate not just  
on this issue, but on a range of social and cultural issues currently  
being forced through the Congress under the leadership of House  
Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole." 
  
The centerpiece of *Freely Espousing* events nationwide will  
be a marathon "read-in" of literary works created with NEA support.  
Featured speakers, round-table discussions, musical performances,  
exhibits, and other events are also planned.

BEYOND JAN 28 Part 1 
  
Los Angeles, Baton Rouge, St.Paul/Minneapolis, 
Wilmington (NC), Seattle, Portland, Charlottesville,  
and Pittsburg as some of the cities where people  
have expressed interest in organizing a *Freely   
Espousing* event.  Because of obvious time constraints, 
it is unlikely that more than a few of these places 
will be able to join us on the 28th.  We therefore  
strongly encourage people to synchronize a second 
wave of events for the following Saturday, Feb. 4th.  
  
Our goal from the beginning has been self-organization  
strengthened by open information channels.  Jennifer  
and I, in concert with  the Ad-Hoc Committee of Literary  
Publishers here in RI, will be happy to provide what  
advice and coordinating support we can to interested  
parties.  As combined independent agents, we can be sure  
that viewpoints excluded by the extant arts bureaucracies 
have a place on the program (even while including spokes- 
persons from those art bureaucracies).   
  
BEYOND JAN 28th Part 2 
  
Most people we've talked with have expressed concerns 
about *sustaining* and *expanding on* the momentum  
generated by these events.  We invite an open debate  
on how this may best be done.  As Alan Bernheimer 
and James Sherry have pointed out in open posts to  
the Poetics List, communication across segmented  
aesthetic, generic, and (most importantly) social 
lines is imperative if our larger goal of preserving  
and sustaining democratic means of expression and 
action is to be approached.  I doubt anyone needs 
reminding of what 1996 could bring if concerted   
efforts are not made now to generalize the material 
and symbolic conditions of possibility for democratic 
action. The "Loose Coalition for Democratic Inspiration"  
that Rod Smith, Lee Ann Brown, and Mark Wallace   
proposed a while back (vis-a-vis the Prayer in the  
Schools initiative) is something we should all consider 
"joining."  
 *  
  
SOME OBSERVATIONS ON MEDIA ISSUES 
  
The opening of Senate hearding on the NEA certainly will  
be overshadowed by Clinton's State of the Union Address 
later the same day.  The advance line on the Address proffered   
by Administration spokespersons today indicates that Clinton  
will not so much as mention the NEA/NEH on Tuesday night (the 
highlight, we are told, will be a xenophobic initiative to  
increase spending on anti-Immigration measures).  If by 
some chance the NEA/NEH is mentioned, by all means use the  
opportunity to increase local media coverage of your standpoint  
on Federal Arts Funding.  If it isn't, sit tight: the NEA 
will probably surface in Thursday's print media.  
  
Anybody who can get a Charger or 49er to make a statement 
in support of the NEA/NEH will be guaranteed early entrance 
into the Small Press Hall of Fame.  
  
You may wish to seize on Murdoch's funding/bribing of a writer   
of little discernible talent (cf. _The Window of Opportunity_)   
and a nationally-recognized penchant for obscenity as a 
brilliant argument for why we need alternatives to the *market.* 
(_Window_ is Newt Gringrich's 1984 "blueprint for the future,"   
published by Tom Doherty Associates, written when NG was Reagan's  
point-man for SDI).  
  
And finally, vis-a-vis Censorship.  We abhor the NEA's imposition  
of censorship on itself as an agency and on the artists it funds.  
The point to keep foregrounded is that eliminating Federal Funding 
for the Arts and contributing to the further consolidation of 
corporate ownership of the means of expression is itself an unparalleled  
act of censorship.  Herb Schiller's *Culture, Inc.* (NY: Oxford, 
1989) remains a great reference on this point.

In-Reply-To:  Message of Sat, 21 Jan 1995 16:57:44 EST from 
 <kalital@MERCURY.CIS.YALE.EDU> 
  
Kali: Just a brief response to your provacative posting in the midst of   
all the Freely Espousing excitement.  
 What is beyond language? You speak of the traumatized persons you 
work with expressing their frustration at the fact that they cannot  
communicate their experiences; you *can't* understand; you *must*  
understand. This seems to me certainly as you suggested a symptom of 
the inadequacy of language, but it also seems to see some personality, 
or personality issues that are beyond or before language. Isn't  
language the closest thing we have to an identity, a personality? Which   
means, I think, that identity is something we share with others,exterior. 
 This is what I was trying to get at when I was speaking of transparency  
as not being in the poetic context. I'd like to amend that and say as far 
as I know transparency, despite Carl Rogers, is not in any context.  
 Transparency assumes the stability of both the sender and the receiver.  
I can't tell you how many times I have spoken or wrote and said not five  
seconds after that I was full of shit and how could I say such things. It 
wasn't me who said them I think to myself. The frustration everyone feels 
with language is in this lack of coherence of identity from moment to  
moment. There is no rapport; something always escapes.  
 As far as language poets vs. Lorde and others, well, that is something 
I'd rather not get involved in. I can say that I think of Lorde's most 
subsversive act is simply being there, unavoidable, unplacatable. What 
she does with language, which is considerable, is to remind us that there 
are other forms out there that not only have a right to exist, but have   
informed the dominant language greatly.  
 I should shut up about the apex of the m'ers, because frankly I don't  
know anything about them. Nor do I want to be seen as some language school  
apologist. I mean, I just got here. Nobody knows me. I'm surprised 
anyone even listens to me.  
 I find them intersting (and here I speak of them as if they were  
already stuffed and mounted on a gallery wall) because I think they  
have pinpointed where to begin to define an oppositional, or revolutionary, 
or whatever, poetry. We start at the beginning of poetry, at the beginning  
of personality, at the beginning of culture. We start with language. 
 What I find particularly interesting is that not only do many 
language poets *subvert* language, like you have properly noticed  
Lorde doing, but they make a sort of intervention into language. They  
try to change its structure. If we are to make any kind of intervention   
into history, this seems to me a model we can work with.  
 Maybe the apexers are working with this. Maybe not. I don't know. I will 
say at this point that I think folks tend to discount manifestoes.  Must  
be some sort of American anti-intellectual thing. The fact that both the  
language poets and the apexers wrote manifestoes is all to their credit as far  
as I am concerned. If we have learned anything in the last few years of NEA/NEH 
controversy after controversy it is that the people doing the work had better 
take the time to define themselves before someody else, like Lynn Cheney,does.  
 Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

In regards to James Sherry's post, why the (again) valorization of the M  
as the sole "meaningful" response of younger "experimental" writers to 
Language poetry? 
  
Why does no one respond to A Poetics of Criticism, Poetic Briefs, various 
essays in Witz and Texture and (sometimes interesting essays) Talisman,   
which have all said much more complex, insightful, and useful things 
regarding this issue?

This will be a brief one. 
  
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE 
  
We have learned that the Senate Committee  
on Labor and Human Resources has postponed 
their scheduled hearing on the NEA until 
later in the week.  As usual, the Committee  
staff proved rather unforthcoming, but we  
will post the new time as soon as we learn 
it. 
  
Also, in yesterday's post we  provided detailed   
information on the Subcommittee on Education, Arts, 
and Humanities.  This week's hearing was called by  
the Full Committee (L & HR), not the subcommittee,  
so the people you see on C-SPAN may not be precisely  
the one's we provided information for.   
  
CALL FOR STATEMENTS  
  
As we have mentioned before, one way to participate 
in *Freely Espousing* is to post a succinct statement 
expressing your viewpoint on the issue of federal 
arts funding.  We will do our best to distribute these  
statements to all participating sites. So far,  
response has been very low on this count.  We think these

ATTACK ON INTEREST FREE LOAN DEFERMENT FOR GRAD/PROF. SCHOOLS 
  
We received an action alert  today (via the Marxist Literary  
Group's list-serve) concerning *Contract with/on America* 
legislation to dismantle interest free loan deferments to 
grad students.  We will be happy to forward that post upon  
request.  A 1-800 number, similar to the one established  
by American Arts Alliance on the NEA issue, has been set  
up (cost $3.95).  We haven't got the number to hand, but  
will include it in our next update. 
  
Alright--we're a little weary here in Providence, and 
a little nervous after having moved our event to a much 
larger space, but reports from across the country are 
very encouraging.  Good work everyone!

 Dear mark--maybe a hint at an answer to your question about APEX BASHING 
 may be found in the analogy with U.S.A. cold war politics...The USA 
 certainly paid far more attention to the USSR than it did to England   
 or France (despite its force du frappe) and the BIPOLAR POLITICAL MODEL  
 still seems to exist in the poetry scene, despite the hype to the contrary...
 This had alot to do with how the L poets "got (in)famous" and have similar 
 effect on MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

This analogy is very useful if only to demonstrate the absurdity of reducing  
all the alternatives, political or poetical, down to two. 
  
But considering the structural similarites of Soviet and US style  
administration, I wonder if you're trying to draw some correlation 
between the claims of m and of the l school?

Another late-night update:  
  
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE 
  
The Senate Hearing on the NEA has been rescheduled  
for Thursday, January 26th, at 9:30 am.  
  
The Congressional Record for January 23rd includes  
a speech given by Senator Pell in defense of the  
Endowment which event organizers/participants may 
wish to glance at.  Also included in the record   
are editorials from various national newspapers.  
They are: 
  
We Need the NEA (Providence Journal 1/15/95) 
Don't Axe Federal Support for Art (NYT 1/13/95)   
Maintain Subsidies to Support the Arts (Chicago Sun-Times 1/13/95) 
Shunning the Yahoo Point of View (Wall St. Journal 1/13/95) 
Making a Case for the Arts (Atlanta Constitution 1/10/95) 
GOP Has A Song for NEA: Taps (LA Times, Washington edition 1/11/95)  
America's Art and Soul (Boston Globe 12/17/94).   
  
In the House, the Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on   
Interior and Related Agencies, was to have met this afternoon 
at 1:30.  I haven't yet seen or heard anything about that (check 
tomorrow's papers).  
  
NEA "PLANS TO" DISTRIBUTE $24 MILLION 
  
Or so I read in 1/24 Boston Globe (but nowhere else so far).  
Massachusetts artists and orgs got $1.3 million.  Reports of  
who received funds in your area could be a handy-way of tracking 
down further *Freely Espousing* participants.

 No, eric (pape), actually, the analogy is severely flawed. I apologize 
 for bringing it up. I do not know "the dealing that goes on behind the 
  wings" but I prefer to be naive enough to hold out hope that if Mr.   
  Mandel or Ms. Perloff sent work to Apex that they would read it seriously 
  and "on its own merits" as it were. I don't want to put words in anyone's 
  mouth, but in a letter I received several years ago from a dear friend  
  of mine who happens to be an APEX editor, Mandel's work was mentioned 
  positively--So I don't understand why he needs to say "I'm a language 
  poet" in such a card-carrying way, as if these NAMES matter more than 
  the poetry...

 Well, Spencer, that IS a tricky question is it. Let's SAY i HATE Newt  
 Gingrich, or at least the interests for which he stands. Well, certainly 
 that hatred isn't gonna make him or them go away, nor necessarily make him 
 a larger threat then he is (except perhaps in our minds--LEST WE FORGET, 
 etc.). It may be a quite different phenomena we're dealing with with the 
 "divided left" which is basically how i read this L vs. M controversy... 
 That the L vs. the M debate seems to obscure a more real debate...  
 If we're going to be political, be political. Anyway, it's way more 
 complicated than this...I'll use paper "without a net" to engage it 
 more. All for now, Chris.

 Dear James,  
  
  L&M S&M?, you're right. The most troubling thing is we've now got 
G.O.D. known only  by the (spiritual) authorities (the fundamentalists; and 
even people saying they're Zen which they want codified, saying even Zen is 
essentially authority /convention as a positive assertion); where analysis  
(of one's language/form), or the form being what occurs or where/how it   
occurs, is to be overthrown as 'conservative.' Or 'merely reactive.' What's 
to occur as 'vision' must be given one from outside in that case. Yet that  
again is similar to the L's (on the West coast, usually two or three 
dominants, by whose ideas the entire group was then characterized -  
sometimes messages being given in manifesto group style; the point being  
that this behavior, which is now reoccurring, is jousting for dominance in  
which value is defined as power not related to literary substance per se, 
given credence by the stated assumption that displacing one's predecessors  
and peers is necessary. This is not the same as being a 'capitalist.'):   
always saying 'Question yourselves (laid bare by writing process), not us,  
or you're conservative; and you're (politically/socially) conservative by 
'definition' if you question us.' 'You' not being an authority. Lew Daley's 
book on Susan Howe and John Taggart uses the word God as the reference 
authority about every third line; it's limiting the vocabulary. Similar to  
Perelman in the past finding the word "intuition" meaningless, essentially  
wanting to eliminate it; but not finding the word "thought" meaningless.  
Daley's book is a work of engagement (certainly passion) and complexity,  
yet his 'God' is as if a given which 'we' are supposed to know (by 
authority/tradition) (and renders valid the poetic observations?) rather  
than phenomena 'to be found out' by experience. In either case, elimination 
of vocabulary is exclusion of words which allow the perception of those   
distinctions as they are 'making' distinctions; which exclusion is also   
'ordering.' 
  The work of most Language poets is still continually changing and 
vital as is that of the various multitudinous dark horses, who're always  
there changing what is occurring. 
  I think the poetic issues, delineated by the two (M/Language) here, 
parallel the contemporary religious and political moves; are not merely   
reactivity by them. For that reason, the Apex of M writing these matters is 
provocative.  
  Personally, I'd rather 'react' to a humane rationalist (meaning   
even the limitations of such a specifically delineated stance) from which 
'place' one can bound freely into one's own (inner) terrain, not usurped by 
anyone, than to have to have 'vision,' 'tradition' and 'spirituality'  
('one's own place,' so that one would simply have to make another place)  
defined and held as a product or a poetic 'position;' which, when defined,  
and defining as power (as one avant-garde overtaking another), is voided.

Wanted to post this to Chris privately, but the nodeid wouldn't work.  
Will have to display my further ignorance of M.   
 I was very interested in Chris's reply to Spencer: if you're  
going to be political, be political. I agree entirely, but isn't a 
technique, a method, a mode of production political? Is politics 
simply contents? 
 Because Forche and others say their work is revolutionary even  
though written in what may be considered reactionary forms, do we  
accept this?  
 And this is where my ignorance is most apparent. I know nothing of   
M, their claims or their practises. The work seemed to be characterized in  
a certain way on the list and it was this characterization I was responding 
to.Perhaps illegitimately?  
 I am interested  in M materials. Any suggestions as to who and where?  
I *do* believe there is now room in poetry and poetics for another vital  
movement, another school in the American passion for schools. My concern  
is that this other take into account the insight into politics and poetics  
I believe L school provides.  
 Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

I think, although others may differ, that the attention to M is based on  
its "belligerent" attack on L, its infantile "why aren't we being  
included in the scene" resentment, and its frontal oversimplified  
politics when addressing such sensitive and subtle issues as spirit. 
  
People are too eager to accept or credit or pay attention to these 
simplified attacks as if such simplicity were a more direct line to  
truth. The L group has tried to represent an alternative to such 
bluntness as antithetical to the complex process of writing and the  
multifold relations between that process and its dissemination to other   
writers to individual readers to the culture as a whole through its ideas 
and recursively to the writer of the original work. M seems to be trying  
to replace that complex web with an antiquated iconography thinly  
updated. I think also that Pam Rehm is a fine poet and the prose writing  
in Apex is admirable and profoundly misdirected. I think it's that 
combination which has attracted attention. 
  
A Poetics and my personal favorite of the new publications "Chain" and 
others have not gotten that attention and that speaks to the exchange  
Chris Stro.. is involved in today. They are engaging in an ongoing dialog 
on many and interesting issues which we wouldn't think about combining in 
some false rubric and reifying to death. They are getting on with the  
work of making a world of poetry. 
  
I wish that the M issue would just go away, but it won't and needs to be  
addressed even if addresssing it does make it more palpable. I wish all   
of those reactionaries disguised as the "new" thing would go away but  
Newt must also be dealt with and all such metered nonsense by people 
afraid to face the future.  
  
I hope that's what you meant by why. Jamses

Is the question, Is L more genuine than M, or is M less rigorous than  
L? Or is it that L + M = (aside from a nostalgia for smoking) M + L  
which is greater than the sum of its parts. Actually, you have to hand 
it to the Mers, who seemed to have learned well from the Lers (who I 
suspect, if "truth" be told, got it from the Yippies) (who, of course, 
got it from Madison Avenue) that a catchy logo(s) is half the battle of

Subject:  a reading of apex of the m 2 
  
I have read Apex of the M 2, of the famous editorial. 
  
Nothing in it is 100% certified radically transparent--and that includes the  
editorial calling for radical transparency.  
  
Some of the stuff in the editorial struck me as radically opaque 
Some as medium opaque  
Some of the poems were of medium transparency  
some of medium opacity 
  
but every poem was extraordinary (though not in the sense of "used for a special
service or occasion"--I thought of the wall street journal, where the  
editorials are conservative and (some of) the stories liberal. Here the editoria
"radical" and the poems are "conservative".  
  
i am pessimistic about radically transparent poetry bringing about the classless
waste your time on me: organize.

RE: James's posting on the NEA: 
  
I think maybe I can rustle up a few "big hair" and long-nail salons out here  
in Staten Island to apply for a grant to satisfy the GOPpers. Do you think  
we should apply under the Folk Art category?  :-) 
  
Seriously, though, an effective strategy would be to accentuate the positive  
and argue for the NEA's survival based on the many small arts organizations and 
 presses, etc., that the endowment funds. They should have have gotten rid of 
the fellowships a long time ago anyway. Besides, you can't even live for a  
year on $20,000 anymore, at least not on the coasts.

Subject:  Re: freely espousing  
  
Thinking about the NEA again and just having listened to NPR: When is it  
better to lose than to win?  Jane Alexander testified to the senate today 
about all the travelling she had done and when she spoke to the common people 
how much art meant to them.  Then the freshman senator from Missouri (I   
forget his name) asked about the problem of art being funded that the  
majority of Americans felt challenged their basic values.  Did Jane Alexander 
then say that that was precisely the type of art that a democracy should  
fund?  No.  Instead she waffled about how they were trying to make sure that  
such things didn't happen in the future, that they had safeguarded again  
funding such things in the future (Mapplethorpe, of course, but not said out  
loud).  Seeing an opening, the senator then said that he for one did not  
trust the NEA to make such safeguards themselves.  Do you see where this is 
going?  What if the NEA is preserved, but only to fund orchestras and such? 
  
Talking to Alexander Ooms (in the lit program at the NEA) a week ago, he  
mentioned something that happened in Louisiana a couple of years ago.  The  
legislature axed all arts funding.  This so mobilized the arts community that 
they put enough pressure on government and the next year the legislature gave 
the arts funding at a dollar per citizen, double their previous budget.   
  
The NEA being eliminated might not be as bad as what's currently shaping up.  
 What if federal grants to individual artists were dropped and all money  
given to states in block grants instead?  One can imagine that this might 
lead to no new artists being funded at all, at least in some (most?) states,  
the climate being such that what's most feared is anything potentially 
perceivable as dangerous, as critical, as confrontational.  
  
I don't like the way this is going.

Cienfuegos said, when the Communist Party was trying to impose   
socialist realism on Cuban art and writing: "Revolutionary art is  
part of the revolution." He did not mean realist stories about heroic  
peasants. He did not mean (have you seen it?) the 1960 National Art

You may want to double check with Jeff Hull, but I  
am pretty sure *FE* will be at the Poetry Project 
(Parish Hall) from 3-6pm.  People are being encouraged  
to attend Kate Rushin's reading at the Ear Inn and  
then proceed over to the Project. 
  
Jeff's number is (212) 777-7436 or you can call   
Brenda at the Project. 
  
Glad to hear of your interest in all this.

Subject:  Espousing Update 1/26 
  
This didn't make it through on a first try.... 
  
----------------------------Original message----------------------------  
As the 28th draws near, reports from all *Freely Espousing* 
sites sound very encouraging. We once again thank everyone  
who has devoted some of (or all of) their time recently to  
making sure that the events will be thought- and action-  
provoking.  We will try to make "field reports" available 
to the list as soon after the events as possible.  So far,  
attempts to have on-line links haven't panned out, but that 
was probably more due to time constraints than anything else. 
  
SUGGESTED PETITION LANGUAGE 
  
 We, the undersigned, wish to make known our unwavering support  
for federal funding of the arts, humanities, and public broadcast  
media.  
 We endorse a strong, uncensored National Endowment of the Arts; 
a vigorous National Endowment of the Humanities; and continued   
public ownership of and access to the airwaves.   
 As citizens, we will oppose all attempts to dismantle the nation's   
cultural infrastructure.  Arts and education must be democratized, not--  
as some members of the 104th Congress currently argue--privatized. 
 Furthermore, in our capacity as artists, writers, scholars, educators, 
students, curators, and persons committed to democratic cultural and 
social ideals, we will continue to assist the public in coming to an 
informed opinion about the enormous return on what is indeed a modest  
national investment in the arts and humanities.   
  
(Note: Joe Ross may have suggestions for alternative language on the 
petitions by tomorrow.  Joe--can you post such if indeed you get it?)  
  
ALEXANDER'S TESTIMONY  
  
We were unable to listen to JA's testimony this morning, but on Ted  
Pelton's account it seems well within her usual range.  And we agree 
with Ted that it is a sobering/depressing range indeed (tho not so 
sobering perhaps as Mr. Heston's House testimony!).  The narrowly  
economic approach being taken by many of the arts advocacy bureacracies   
should, we think, be countered by an articulate collective voice within   
the context of continued support for federal arts funding.  Here in  
Providence, that's one thing we'll be interested in watching on  
Saturday: as organizers, we are arguing democracy, not the bottom line, as  
the bottom line.  Many of our featured speakers, however, will take  
the prevailing economic line. Should be interesting.  
  
PROVIDENCE FEATURED SPEAKERS  
  
We don't have detailed programmes for other sites, but we thought  
people might be interested to know the speakers we'll be featuring 
on Saturday.  They are:   
  
Roger Mandle, President of Rhode Island School of Design and NEA 
 Advisory Counsel Member  
Liam Rector, Freedom to Write-Boston  
C.D. Wright, RI Poet Laureate 
Ray Rickman, Host of PBS's _Bestsellers_ 
Terry Ann Greenwood, Director of RI Arts Advocates, Dir. of RI Philharmonic 
Randy Rosenbaum, Director of Rhode Island State Council on the Arts  
Doreen Bolger, Director of RISD Museum   
Michael Harper, Professor of Creative Writing at Brown, Former State Laureate 
Rudy Cheeks, journalist for local alternative weekly(The Phoenix)  
Congressman Jack Reed  
Mayor of Providence Vincent "Buddy" Cianci 
  
Many other people from the education, dance, theater, small press, and 
artists collectives "scenes" in RI have leant support and will participate  
throughout the day.  
  
  
STATEMENTS FROM AFAR 
  
After our last request, we received several excellent statements that  
will be read on Saturday.  We'll include further statements if they  
arrive in time to be printed up, so take twenty minutes tomorrow and 
dash one out. 
  
NEA COVER STORY  IN THIS WEEKS VILLAGE VOICE 
  
A valuable four pages or so in this week's *Voice* includes a 
terrific piece by Michael Feingold in which he applies to Switzerland  
for "amnesty" on behalf of the U.S.'s half-million cultural workers. 
C. Carr's "Hanging by a Thread" is useful for identifying the key  
advocacy groups currently working on saving arts funding.  Elizabeth 
Hess tallies the costs of internal censorship on both the NEA & NEH's  
parts.  
  
AND DON'T MISS   
  
The editorial in today's NY Times entitled "Eating Her Offspring" by 
Mike Rich.  Rich adopts OJ-speak to point out the considerable contra- 
dictions in Lynne Cheney's testimony to Tuesday's House subcomittee, 
most importantly her attack on the National History Standards that 
she helped to write and that she now cites as evidence of the NEH's  
unacceptable behavior.

Subject:  apex of the m 
  
The truth of a process makes sense to and among those at the end of the   
process, where the transcription of thought on the page is a clean mirror 
to both writer and readers, writer as s/he writes, reader as s/he reads;  
the book unwritten is the look that speaks volumes between and among such.  
  
This so rare that most of us do in the name of more, ever more, vocal and 
verbal, dropped out of empathy then yanked back, the lack of us in "you-you"  
the vocation of study, time out.  
  
Oscar does not believe that art is being and thought is ugliness. He says so  
as in his day was no art and thought. Those who use Freud as if he were   
himself as benign and liberational as they do what he did not put sex against 
the ban on sex, power against stable. 
  
Such sects! Lift up hearts, prey on. The dream can only create if sleep is  
not for the provision of rest, o day for rest and night for study. Bade the 
body. The good faith goads the intellect setting the church of our agenda 
which, fulfilled, burns. We digest the stone and break into a jog. 
  
Dream breathing. Think, your very heart beating is bleeding and the blood 
next to come is bleeding into your heart, the oxygen is bleeding to become  
blood, the folks with beating blood are beating the air only. Dream wing. 
  
All every night walk by the venue in their heads where perfect truth of   
process plays the energy of creation. All have greater artists than  
Shakespeare to meet, but avery eye, don't converse, few attend, few  
remember, we are special in knowing we're special not especially.  
  
The perfect dreamer in all, in each, not a speaking to us all. Few go to  
sleep with the energy to mingle. I know I'm not alone in this. Shakespeare  
the artist in history, fifty of the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of 
years, everyone is Shakespeare. 
  
The dead can dance. Dreams trot through our excuses, scared to knock such 
vital guards. The fear's not explained till the dream's not come back  
against twenty such sentries. Step out of the stage and into the tubes.   
  
Stick to your gun till you blow off your head, walk again on your legs no 
one else's, carry your seed as she grows in your arms, out of your pain, let  
her, away from your pain. Think well of yourself, use your hands, get a grip, 
on the non-carnal gun. 
  
So many arms, swinging under the noosed throats, the unspoken carried on so 
many legs. Like dream life's accidents, vile, we dream nearer and nearer, the 
guard hangs in the air, twitching, tapping. We feel bumped into until, joy, 
we are alive. 
  
The ambient never wake up. Like you don't. You begin to ban humour and 
alcohol, the mares buck and head for the guards in new hope. Rest is not it,  
without truth towards process towards truth. 
  
If you're still reading, no-one's got anything. Some *should* let thoughts  
fester in the mind, process the festering. I know mortally the years from 
when I was born, each day the unit of measurement cuts history into me-sized  
portions, knowing ledges. I dodder to think the art of it.  
  
Sophocles mortal braved Freud, now so less winning. The Freud-led walk through  
him, more to hurt that if they'd gone by him, on every shelf in every  
flame-stricken library? Mind how you go. Excavate Plato, afraid to go out,  
for dream research.  
  
Nothing like life to keep you from dying, the nerves are steel strings, loud  
acoustic. Song begins the vibration, words reason the entry, into society,  
largely worthy of nothing so clarity! 
  
Be you once, the harsh heart sooner or timely, a slick into two dimensions, 
of prose, this nuisance is losing its once fascination, the pattern returns 
to its usual dynamic. Think in the two, drink in the third, things they don't 
want to reveal indicate why do you say that. 
  
I get it. Draw on planes, repairing the prairie, the gasses from the busses,  
the hole us. Destroy two to save three. The hurt behind the face understood 
yields to surf on the face again. 
  
The month from a flame that took our collection, from our senses, and  
flashed a banner over a dish of a dominant hemisphere, the northern, a cap  
with the bill right in front of our eyes. A missable interactive experience,  
a miserable sky made it so. 
  
Is cool holodeck sky? I sensed it cambe back to my name, but a short therapist  
circuits the patient, tree dimensional. I'll take my "clumsiness", I didn't 
dream "it" up, I ride broken in the bumps of a world I ought never to have  
believed was mine only thought. Alive-in world.   
  
The process of a sense makes truth to and among those at the head of a 
process, where the transcription of truth on the page is a claimed mirror to  
both writers and reader, writer as reader as utter; the book unsmitten is 
the look that speaks volumes between and among such.

Well, Chris, I don't know about yr distinction here. You talk about work  
read "on its own merits," that's what I was responding to.  
To me the group label is a secondary issue, though certainly related to   
what I consider primary--namely that people are unwilling or unable to 
respond to the work on its own merits. They need the signature, the name  
behind it, whatever might go along with that, whether it be group  
affiliation, things they've heard about you, yr publishing and/or life 
history or what they know of it, relations or encounters they've had with 
you, what they think of you, what they've heard other people think of  
you, what you believe and what you say about yrself (or anything else  
under the sun). In short, what they know or think they know of who you 
are. This is what I mean by name, and this is what is more important in   
our social reality than the work, unfortunately--most unfortunately. 
Yrs, Spencer

I am standing on the fringes. . .of this NEA thing, interested and 
provoked, yet not quite knowing where I stand on the issue.  I am curious 
if someone would care to articulate the argument exactly why the federal  
government should keep funding the arts, humanities, etc.  Now, keep in   
mind I am of the inclination that it should be continued--that we need 
support for arts and culture in this country--but that I am particularly  
curious how it is possible to argue with what appears a majority (hardly) 
who feel that such funding has been to undermine their values.  How does  
one make the argument that the government ought to fund something that 
may militate against convention and "American" values?  The way I see  
this is that it is going to very difficult to persuade people with power  
(reflecting the national mood-swing) to fund something that offends  
them.  Does the federal government have a responsibility to fund art?  
Yes, of course it does, but if resources are few and the choices even  
fewer then . . .?  Gosh, you know, I know I may be putting my head in the 
proverbial lion's mouth here, but I am interested in what and why on this 
issue and ask it so that I might understand it better.  I don't want to   
offend anyone who feels strongly about this, I mean, afterall, I'd much   
rather the government fund education, art, mass transportation, etc, etc, 
than the military, etc, etc, etc.  . . .  And I'm also interested in the  
possibility that this fiscal argument is actually a covert way of making  
a cultural argument, of defunding the opposition.  But here's where it 
gets real interesting, doesn't it, I mean, should those that feel that 
their values are under attack from these agencies honestly be persuaded   
that they should cough up tax money for something that offends them. 
It's our money, too, I suppose, but, sometimes I wonder if they're aren't 
more of them than there are of us. . . and I hate saying that cause we 
should all be having a broader dialogue with others of different opinions 
so we can explain what it is that we are attempting when we reread 
Western Civilisation and so they can articulate why it upsets them . . .  
and this all makes it so clear of how much is really at stake I suppose   
and I have to wonder if the opposition between the for/against isn't a 
distraction from some larger issue that we should be paying attention to  
...or, I mean that the argument is a distraction from something else we   
should be noticing or . . . .  And, you know, I just want to know why, 
why is arts funding important and why should someone who believes it's 
not fiscally responsible and culturally offensive pay for it?  Sorry so long.

 Welcome to the Poetics List. 
  
Please note that this is a private list and information about the list should 
not be posted to other lists or directories. The idea is to keep the list to  
those with specific rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale 
of the  list small and the volume managable.  Word-of-mouth (and its 
electronic equivalents) seems to be working fine: please feel  free to invite 
people you know to sign-up.  It is easier for me if they sign-up by themselves  
AND send me (bernstei@ubvms) a note telling me how they heard about the list.  I
will send them *this* document in reply. 
  
To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to   
  
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu  
  
Leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message blank.  In the 
body of your e-mail message type: 
  
  review poetics 
  
(The shorter bitnet address is listserv@ubvm. All further 
references to "Listserve" are to this listserve.) 
  
The list has open subscriptions.  You can sub or unsub by sending a one-line  
message, with no subject line, to the listserv address: 
  
unsub poetics Jill Jillway  
  
{or}  
  
sub poetics Jill Jillway  
  
I will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. 
  
ARCHIVES  
  
There are two ways to get archives.  The easiest way is to use the archives 
of the list at the Electronic Poetry Center (EPC), for which see the end of 
this message.  The other way is described below:  
  
Anyone interested in an archive of all postings after March may  
send this message to "Listserve": 
  
index poetics 
  
or  
  
index poetics f=mail 
  
You will receive a list of archived files in a format that  
includes something like this: 
  
* rec  last - change 
* filename filetype GET PUT -fm lrecl nrecs date time 
  
  POETICS  LOG9403  ALL OWN V  80  1012 94/05/31 07:17:17  
Started on Mon,  
7 Mar 1994 12:51:12 -0600 
  POETICS  LOG9404  ALL OWN V  83  1864 94/05/31 07:18:54

Started on Sun,  
1 May 1994 09:47:10 -0500 
  
  
You can then send the "get" command to "Listserve" in the format:  
  
get filename filetype  (eg: get poetics log9403   
  get poetics log9403   
  get poetics notebook) 
  
or  
  
get filename filetype f=mail  
  
depending on which log file you want (you can also get multiple  
files with one message).  Note that each of the files has a 
different beginning and end date, eg LOG9404 starts 7 March and  
goes to 31 May and that dates overlap. Go figure!  "Poetics 
Notebook" is an anomalous name for what is, in effect, another   
log file. 
  
******* 
  
To subscribe to RIF/T, the e-poetry magazine at UB's Poetics Program:  
  
Send an e-mail message to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu.  Leave   
the "Subject" line of the e-mail message blank.  In the body of  
your e-mail message type: 
  
subscribe e-poetry Firstname Lastname 
  
where Firstname and Lastname correspond to your name. 
  
You will receive a confirmation of your subscription soon 
thereafter.  (Nonsubscribers can automatically sub to Poetics 
using this same format, but substituting "poetics" for "e-  
poetry".)

1.0 Basic Assumptions 
  
The Electronic Poetry Center seeks to provide a central _place_  
for Internet resources for poetry and poetics.

The Center continues to provide access to the electronic poetry  
and poetics journal, RIF/T, and the archives of the Poetics List.  
Needless to say, the EPC provides quality archival materials for 
these resources. For the Poetics archive, a feature has recently 
been added to allow keyword searching for the immense number of  
files comprising this archive.  
  
The EPC author library offers texts and/or information about  
contemporary poets in a variety of formats.  
  
A number of electronic journals are archived and distributed by  
the EPC. Journals distributed through the EPC differ from other  
e-journal archives in a significant way: the texts presented here  
have been checked and verified by their issuing agency, thus at  
least getting to you versions of electronic journals that have a 
direct link to their source. We are delighted to offer these  
journals to you and will continue to make sure texts presented   
are done so in collaboration with their producers. For resources 
outside the EPC, we have written links to make seamless 
connections to these resources. It is our aim to be vigilent  
about our links so that persons interested in poetry and poetics 
do not have to spend a lot of time digging for addresses, 
remembering sites, and locating resources. Through the selections  
available at the EPC, users of the system have simple and direct 
access to many other related Internet resources.  
  
The Center also provides information about contemporary little   
magazines and small presses engaged in poetry and poetics. Since 
this information is often difficult to locate, it is presented at  
the EPC in hopes of recongizing these contributions, facilitating  
communication, and providing an additional outlet for these 
extremely valuable print sources. Look here also for Selby's List  
of Experimental Magazines.  
  
The Poetry & Poetics Document Archive provides access to a number  
of documents of use to poets, teachers, and researchers. Here you  
will find essay material and current obituaries. This area should  
be consulted in conjunction with the Poetics Files and Small  
Press Sources areas, which also offer material of pedagogical 
use.  
  
The EPC also presently offers gallery, sound, exhibts, and an 
announcements area.  
___________________________________________________________________  
  
2.0 Poetry and the Electronic Place  
  
Compared to say, a year ago, many people might agree that the 
idea of some sort of an electronic forum for poetry is not only a  
possibility but an inevitability. We have seen the continued  
growth of the Poetics List (I counted around 250 postings the 
month of December 1994 alone) and the development of the  
Electronic Poetry Center. The EPC has maintained a significant   
circulation. We regularly get letters from various world outposts  
attesting to the reality of such connectivity. Interesting also  
are the number of visits taking place, both locally and across   
distance; despite the dips and peaks that typify any active 
place, the EPC has seen a good amount of traffic across its 
doorstep. For those with such inclination (and it is illuminating  
that the following compare favorably with circulation statistics,  
say, for a little magazine) here are some numbers:  
  
_Month_   _Connects_  
Nov 1994  573  
Oct 1994  429  
Sep 1994  367  
August 1994 348  
July 1994 614  
June 1994 110  
  
These statistics give only a sense of scale, it should be noted, 
since direct connections to EPC submenus and entries through  
Veronica searches, a significant number of connects, are not  
included in the above statistics. 
___________________________________________________________________  
  
3.0 Interface: Gopher, Web, Mosaic   
  
Even as activities converge, it is also the time of divergent 
interfaces. I am often surprised by the number of our 
contributors and participants who do not even have gopher access.  
(These, again, not represented in the above statistics.) Most 
people, we figure, have at least gopher access, though Web access  
is quickly becoming a standard. Mosaic, it would be assumed,  
though assuming predominance in the University setting, has 
hardly become a reality for most dial-up users, particularly  
internationally. (For the sake of a common ground, gopher is an  
ascii-based interface that offers access through the selection of  
menus; the web is an ascii-based interface that offers access 
through _screens_ of information with links to other areas  
appearing as highlighted text; Mosaic is a graphical interface   
basically superimposed on the Web structure that offers images,  
sound, video, and allows you to use your mouse as a navigational 
tool.) The EPC is accessible through any of these interfaces. It 
is presently evolving strongly towards exclusive Web/Mosaic 
access. 
  
_Informational Notes_: (1) The standard for Web/Mosaic documents 
is the markup protocol called html. These are imbedded codes that  
you will see once in a while when you download an html document. 
These codes give instructions to the software about highlighting,  
fonts, and screen layout, as well as providing for the _hot 
links_ that make possible Web/Mosaic navigation. (2) A feature of  
these interfaces that should be mentioned is the bookmark. You   
may wish to investigate this as most systems allow you to set a  
bookmark, say at the EPC, and gain immediate access to it when   
you invoke your interface.  
___________________________________________________________________  
  
4.0 RIF/T Notes  
  
Forthcoming from RIF/T are two special issues. The first of these  
is the Transpoeisis issue (see EPC Announcements for details) 
which will offer a muti-faced and multi-format approach to the   
presentation of translations. Also forthcoming, a planned special  
issue on Charles Olson. RIF/T will also soon issue the first in a  
series of special chapbooks. Much on the way!  
___________________________________________________________________  
  
5.0 EPC New Additions

In answer to Jeffery Timmons, and anyone else --  
As a scholar whose field of research is information policy, I've spent 
some time over the past couple of years articulating reasons why a 
nation-state should be concerned about arts policy.  The arguments I 
offer differ from those traditionally available (makes money for the 
communities, eg...) because I believe the position of the arts within the 
postmodern condition/the information society play a different role vis a  
vis private and public power structures.  Theories of self-organizing  
systems are used.  
Happy to send a "popular" and/or academic version of these arguments 
fully laid out to anyone who sends a snail address, and will try to put a 
one-screen version of the arguments up later today.

When I saw her at Naropa last summer, Katie Yates was saying that she  
planned to move permanently to Boulder. She'd attended Naropa before 
Albany (and is, in fact, the first grad of the Kerouac school to go on 
to get a PhD in writing, odd degree that that is). She was on this list   
when she was at Albany, but I don't know if she still has access. Katie,  
are you there?

Ron,  
  A PhD in writing wld be an odd degree indeed. The Albany grad  
program,however, involves what we call "a nexus of discourses" with  
three primary areas: writing / criticism / pedagogy. A degree has to 
involve at least 2 of those, as did, for example, Katie's.

Jeffrey Timmons has articulated certain vague apprehensions that I have   
also entertained in regard to the whole NEA funding controversy.  In 
particular, I have always entertained a certain unease about the funding  
of individual artists; there is a sense that by allowing the government   
(through whatever assemblage of artist-advisors brought in to make value  
judgements, ect) to pick and choose them,  that we are perpetuating a  
hegemonic acceptance of and de facto perpetuation of whatever stylistic   
movement is deemed to have sufficient cultural currency at any given

Rather, I would probably like to see the NEA become an organization  
dedicated to funding other local organizations, who in turn would support 
those individuals in whom they find merit.  Let The Knitting Factory, the 
local Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts, and the regional art  
organizations decide where the federal dollars are spent.  Local 
funding, local control... 
  
Just wanted to put my 2 cents in...

The following more lengthy message articulates in broad brushstrokes what 
art policy might b e in the 1990s relative to today's policy environment, 
the postmodern characteristics of our culture, and what it means to be in 
an information economy. The NEA ain't the only game in town.  Sandra Braman

so would i, but that sort of thing is _exactly_ what the first   
round of hearings made clear was unacceptable to congress.  they 
want _more_ control, not less...  
  
and, since i have in the past voiced my own misgivings about  
the NEA, let me say that Newt Helms & co. do not need my help

Subject:  reified names vs. boundless vocabulary  
  
 I'm changing the "name" of this debate/discussion--not so much because 
 I necessarily see the issue as more 'real' in an absolute way but it   
 is perhaps more empowering. There are several 'issues' or 'insights'   
 I'd like to 'address'. Tom Mandel's recent post claims "difference is  
 where it's at" and basically I agree. The question then becomes a 
 matter of the debate between the structuralist "Difference between" 
 and the post-structuralist "difference within," a "meta" debate I 
 find engaging. When Tom writes "I want the discourse to proceed at the 
 level of the poetry" he raises the question of the RELATION between 
 poetry and polemics. Eric Pape brings up the "politics is not simply   
 content" but also form and that can be a little too black and white 
 at times. For the example he uses claims that the trouble with Forche  
 is her work in "reactionary forms". Yet, maybe that wouldn't be such   
 a problem werethe work engaged in a more rigorous questioning of the   
 complexities of current political/ideological/economic questions rather  
 than the relatively SAFE poems about World War II, etc. And maybe Kali 
 Tal would argue, but too much VIETNAM poetry seems to do this too...   
 Nonetheless, I do not wish to reject these voices out of hand. And  
 in terms of this i find Leslie Scalapino's comments quite helpful.  
 She considers Lew Daly's appeal to "God" as a too limiting vocabulary  
 and equates it to perelman's rejecting "intuition" but not "thought."  
 And this illuminates but one way in which the L poets (Baby boomers?)  
 and the M editors (gen. x?) are actually quite similar, despite James  
 Sherry's assertion that "The L group (not the CHUBB group] has tried   
 to represent an alternative to such bluntness as antithetical to the   
 complex process of writing..." Yes! However, I can not necessarily  
 totally side with the urge for boundless vocabulary. In the first 
 place, even if i hold it a value to have no taboos in my work and 
 say everything (as it were), there are certain "charecteristic" things 
 I return to often.In the second place this may be as much of an issue  
 of "difference within" as "difference between" (When I first got into  
 poetry in around 1986 I remember going back and forth, dialectically   
 as it were, between Brecht and Ashbery and i also remember being rather  
 skeptical towards the "times they are a changing" and the "gotta serve 
 somebody" dylan--prefering the more complex "Bringin' It All/Hiway 61" 
 stuff--but then one day it hit me "YES, there is a certain level on 
 which it's BLACK AND WHITE"). I do not claim to solve any of this 
 nor do I mean to come off like some "independent" "third party candidate"  
 with an "open mind" (ever hear the song by MAGAZINE--"My mind ain't so 
 open that anything would crawl in") but I'm curious when Tom (Mandel)  
 writes that a NEGATIVE RESPONSE IMPLIES A CLOSED MIND. In the first 
 place, what IS a NEGATIVE RESPONSE? Don Byrd told me (forgive me if 
 I'm misquoting you Don) that although his last book of poetry was 
 reviewed quite favorably, it wasn't the response he wanted. he didn't  
 think people "got it." Often, so-called NEGATIVE responses show far 
 more engagement with the work than so-called POSITIVE ones. But not 
 always. One last point I would like to flog like a dead horse is the   
 question of Mandel's definition of the identity of himself as a LANGUAGE 
 poet as historical and not card-carrying. Do we define say David Shapiro 
 or John Godfrey, roughly the same age and with many of the same concerns 
 as a good number of the L poets, as LANGUAGE poets--historically. 
 Doesn't this become like the academic co-optation of poets. i had a 
 teacher at Temple who was bent on proving that marianne moore was an   
 objectivist, because she saw herself as an objectivist and began to 
 like Moore. That can be interesting I suppose, but what i'm more  
 interested in at present is what Leslie Scalapino calls "multidinous   
 dark horses."(typo at multitidinous) In what context? Chris...

Reply to Jeffrey Timmons re: arts & humanities funding: 
  
First of all, I don't believe that there is a national mood supporting 
Gingrich & co., but rather that it's manufactured; neither do I believe the 
country is in terrible financial trouble, as NEA/NEH detractors would have  
it.  Sometimes their manuevers are naked: witness Lynn Cheney testifying  
against the NEH two years after chairing the agency herself and testifying it 
should be renewed, and that at a time when we had a worse deficit.  But to  
the point (I could get into an interrelated media and politicians and  
corporations thing, but it's a rather familiar tune by now), I offer the  
following quotations:  
"I believe, as a free society, we need to protect diversity and encourage the 
exchange of ideas.  I regard some recent attempts to cut funding for NEA as 
attempts at censorship, and at silencing one part of this discussion." 
 "The world leadership which has come to the United States cannot rest solely 
upon superior power, wealth, and technology, but must be solidly founded upon 
worldwide respect and admiration for the Nation's high qualities as a leader  
in the realm of ideas and of the spirit."  
"Democracy demands wisdom and vision of its citizens.  It must therefore  
foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the 
humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located 
masters of the technology and not its unthinking servants." 
The first quote is from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin.  Why doesn't  
something like this come from Jane Alexander was my question a couple days  
ago.  It isn't outside the debate, but she chose to compromise before the 
fight began.  Conservatives are trying to censor those who stand for values 
they don't agree with.  Values is a word that's been taken over by the Right, 
as if you have to be a fundamentalist to have values.  But things that are  
happening in Congress right now are deeply offensive to my values -- the  
right to have an art that functions as critique and antidote to prevailing  
norms, a neccessity in a democracy.  (That much more necessary because the  
press -- which Madison and Jefferson and co. thought would save us -- have  
abdicated their adversarial position vis a vis government, preferring a   
scandal-sheet mentality.)  The second two quotes are also from the center, or 
at least what used to be the center: both come from the original NEA/NEH  
charter in 1965.  I particularly like "masters of their technology and not  
its unthinking servants."  Is it possible that the US Government once  
produced language like that?  Now all the powers that be seem to want are 
unthinking servants.  Thus the endowments are opposed.  
Who are *the people* we're always being told support this and condemn that? 
 I don't buy what I'm told the people want.  Polls are a sophisticated form 
of lie; similarly, I can structure my lectures to my students so that I see 
my own phrases coming back to me on tests.  But as a part of the people, I'm  
going to demand what I think the nation should stand for; that first 
government quote hits home for me -- I'm tired of being known around the  
world for our endless flow of weapons to the world's thugs, or as the world's 
biggest thug.  James Sherry said something similar the other day: "A nation 
should support   
its culture not as a business but as its representative to the world."  I 
could add: others will represent you if you don't represent yourself.

[The editors of Dark Ages Clasp the Daisy Root are preparing electronic   
versions of some of the material from their magazine, which will soon  
be available at the EPC.  This text is provided as introduction.]  
  
  
Dark Ages Clasp the Daisy Root #4, Sept. 1990  
  
Editorial:  
  
 We live at a time in which "modern" no longer makes clear   
what differentiates the present from the past.  Comes instead the  
prefix "post-," illuminating like a metaphysical truth an age 
that never did, perhaps, exist, signifying above all our wish to 
be rid of words that no longer help us speak.  What Beverly 
Dahlen calls "a journey of indecipherables.a way in the cloying  
dark" defines a relation to history no longer indifferent to  
language.  Fate throws the darkness in our path.  We believe that  
terms, outwitting their applications, charge us with the task of 
preparing further journeys. 
  
 The "ancient confidence" Charles Olson felt when he named   
himself "POST-MODERN," idiosyncratically, to state that he _did_ 
belong to something called a "universe," no longer moves us to   
overthrow estrangement.  As long ago as 1950, Olson realized that  
what is modern is "Man" itself, that "Man's" only means of  
opposing "himself"--withstanding the brutality of "his" will, the  
tyranny of a modern logos--is the body, "intact and fought for." 
Without this ground--without an experience specific to time and  
place--we are lost.  "The _modern_," declared Olson, writing  
Robert Creeley, "(and we have to push this biz, of the SINGLE I, 
to undo the modern) does--admit it or not--feel he does _not_ 
belong to what--just, quick, call it, the universe."  
  
 Such "undoing" (a word that recalls the spinning of the  
Moirai) represents what theologian Mark C. Taylor terms "errant" 
thought.  "Repeatedly slipping through the holes in the system   
within which it must, nevertheless, be registered," writes  
Taylor, "such thought is perpetually transitory and forever 
nomadic."  The individual, the single I, given over as one might 
yield the most useless of properties, to the _properties_ of that  
"Worth"--a breath that is taken, the beating of a heart no less a  
fact than the fiction of God by which history is made and 
written--insofar as _it is_ given, announces itself as an 
illusion.  This is what the Old Testament called _tselem_:  a 
phantom, a representation, an image.  
  
 Held in the procreant hands of time, the postmodern--  
applying that word as Olson coined it--enters upon the Earthly   
Paradise so errantly addressed in _Maximus_. 
  
 Man came here by an intolerable way.  When man is 
 reduced to so much fat for soap, superphosphate for  
 soil, fillings and shoes for sale, he has, to begin  
 with, one answer, one point of resistance only to such 
 fragmentation, one organized ground, a ground he comes 
 to by a way the precise contrary of the cross, of  
 spirit in the old sense, in old mouths.  It is his own 
 physiology he is forced to arrive at.  And the way--the  
 way of the beast, of man and the Beast. 
  
If Olson resists the call of God in this, he does so to repossess  
creation, to mark and insist "that the idea of one god itself is 
only an extension of the principle, that one man can, by the  
labor of his life, give light that others can use to have 
theirs."  
  
 Man and woman--in _their_ image, the shadow of divinity, 
fallen.  Is this the apotheosis of what Postmodernism would 
inaugurate?  What other names for our relation to the past, for  
the burden of our present?  _So many stumble / going out of the  
world_, writes Susan Howe, _word flesh crumbled page edge . . . A  
question of overthrowing_.  No longer indifferent to language,   
have we become, in our disaffection, our estrangement, unused to 
other paths, other ways through the cloying dark?  Has the  
brashness denoted by the prefix "post-" become a despair, an  
intellectual despair, rigorous as geometry?  
  
 A journey of indecipherables 
  
 A question of overthrowing 
  
_For its power_, writes Olson, thinking of what he came to call  
the soul, _is bone muscle nerve blood brain man or woman, its  
fragile mortal force its old eternity, a stumbling_.

I thought Ted's response was pretty right on about the manufacturing of   
consent (Chomsky?) and I agree with him on this point, but (and this for  
the sake of sorting this out better for myself) doesn't that idea sort of 
deny the validity of those that--false consciousness or manufactured 
consent be it may--honestly hold and feel as strongly about their  
beliefs?  And that's what seems to me to be the issue here: cultural 
conflict, in the sense that various versions of America are being brought 
into conflict, that it's being described as a battle, a cultural war, and 
it's actually taking on more and more shades of division and separation   
between my America and your's--so  to speak.  Proposition 187 and the  
calls for tighter immigration, the Haitian invasion, Newt's defense of 
American Civilisation, and all the negative reactions 
to multiculturalism as a weakening of WESTERN CIVILISATION--these all  
seem to reflect an attitude or a drawing of battle lines or a 
restratification ... where am I?  Or as Emerson said, "Where do we find   
ourselves?"  I think that's what he said . . .  The point is, the  
question I have for Ted is if consent or opinion is manipulated or 
manufactured does that mean that those that hold those views are 
embodiments of a form of false consciousness--and does that make us any   
less subject to alternative forms of that same process from other loci 
of power?  And if--if, mind you--their consent or opinion is not 
manufactured and neither is ours and we both have--demand--a  
representation in America of our views how do we mediate these   
positions.  This is only a lame attempt to think about these issues, so   
don't hold me to any accuracy or clarity in articulating them--they've 
been hounding me, especially as I've tried to listen over the past few 
months to conservative points of view in order to understand the 
arguments.  I'm a registered independent, for what it's worth.  Anyway....

chris stroffolino can't be serious in thinking that if I'm

Anyway, what difference can it possibly make?  
  
it's not whether your mind is open or closed but what is  
it closes or opens your mind. What makes this the end 
of a century? a convention. What makes this _late_  
capitalism. a convention. what makes this the deadend 
of a culture? a convention. 
  
the music of alois haba invalidated the theoretical/  
critical/historical harmonic judgment theories of 
schoenberg. work renders theory its meaningful or 
meaningless place. but haba's music does not 
invalidate the music of schoenberg. work only  
underlines the interest, the possibility, of 
other work - of previous work, of new work.  
  
a discourse in re: poetry that is interesting to  
poetry is one that adds space for poetry to be 
made. Adds space. It is in the nature of powerful 
work, interesting work, fabulous work, to provide 
more not fewer places for next work to take off   
from. Hence, "a fundamental break with the past"  
is a marketing term with meaning if you want 
to rev your network, but of no interest to 
long scope activities like poetry. a connection   
with the past is no different from a connection   
with the future. This is the reason it is possible  
for poets like Duncan or Mandelstam to write 
about Dante in ways that unveil new possibilities 
for poetry.

I agree with Robert Drake that it's not a rational issue at all.  It 
seems very weird to me (or par for the course) that the smithsonian  
exhibit has taken so much flak (ha) for daring to challenge the  
conventional wisdom of the enola gay.  Conventional, not informed  
opinion, apparently.  And isn't this what it comes down to, that history, 
politics, poetry are empty--essentially (were there such a thing)--and 
that we and everyone else realizes this and that we are contesting who 
gets to define and represent such things as Hiroshima and the dropping of 
the bomb to ourselves?  I share robert drake's pessimism, particularly 
when it comes to being able to negotiate competiting histories. More to   
say, always more to say, but not more time to say it . . . .

Invalidated schoenberg?  Hm.  Long scope?  Yeah, ok.  And, well, a 
connection with the past is different than a connection with the future,  
but connection is the important thing.  As with capital so with poetry,   
there is no out; and that's ok.  Eliot discusses this in Tradition and 
the Individual Talent; it's really also Bloom's argument in any number 
of  places where he takes about revisionary ratios and misreading, la, 
la, la....  And tom, if I read this right, is right: marketing strategy,  
but not useful.  Tradition, if only to empty it out.

Ok, how is theory not work?  Freud said writers had said all that he said 
before and better (rough paraphrase, I assure you) than he--is this the   
difference between theory and work?  In a sense, then the poetry is no 
less theoretical.  I missed the schoenberg is not invalidated--but tom 
had it the other way as well--schoenberg is invalidated.  " I contain  
multitudes . . . ."

From:   Ron Silliman <rsillima@IX.NETCOM.COM> 
Subject:  NEA & Randy Cunningham  
  
The individual most likely to determine whether or not the NEA survives   
in 1995 is a GOP Congressman from San Diego, Randy ( Duke ) Cunningham.   
Every writer (and, indeed, artist) in California needs to contact this 
dude and let him that his future as a statewide politician may hinge on   
the House reauthorizing the NEA.  
  
Others with less strategic, but nonetheless critical, roles include  
Congresspeople (I believe they are all men actually) Livingston of 
Louisiana; Bill Goodling of Gettysburg, PA; Kasich of Columbus, OH;  
Regulia of Canton, OH; Gunderson of Wisconsin (the gay member of the 
GOP); Rukema (of where?) and Castle of Delaware.  
  
Not one of these folks has email. 
  
These are the key players according to Eliot Figman of Poets and Writers  
& Jim Sitter of CLMP, with whom I met today. Both have been accompanying  
Gigi Bradford, the lit director of the NEA, on a tour. (Bradford s 
constrained by her position from discussing such matters, although she 
was quite enthusiastic about the Freely Espousing events.)  
  
Figman & Sitter believe that, with Kassabaum (I m probably misspelling a  
lot of these names, but I m working fast late at night ) and Jeffords  
both supporting the Endowment, the votes exist in the Senate for the 
NEA, but that House is much more problematic.  
  
Here s why: for reasons of parliamentary procedure, the NEA needs to be   
blessed by three separate processes in each house this year. It must 
first receive  authorization  from each house. It must also receive an 
appropriation. And the budget must leave enough room in the general  
category for the appropriation to be budgeted. The first two processes 
are especially important, since the third can happen through a number of  
different scenarios. 
  
If the Senate authorizes and the House does not, it goes to conference 
committee. In such a circumstance, the bill is not  conferenceable,  
meaning that you can t half authorize it. It s all or nothing. So the  
Senate version would have to win out in conference. The exact same 
scenario applies for appropriation. If the House fails to authorize  
and/or appropriate and its version wins in either conference committee,   
then the NEA is kaput. On the budget bill, there s much more room for  
raising and lowering sums and jockeying around between categories. 
  
This means that the chance of the NEA of surviving is at best one in 
four. 
  
Randy  Duke  Cunningham chairs the House committee that is charged with   
authorizing (or not) the NEA. To give you an idea of its centrality to 
that committee s purpose, it s the Early Childhood, Youth and Families 
subcomittee (of Ways and Means?). 
  
Goodling chairs the committee that it reports up to. So that s his role.  
Regulia and Livingston are keys in the appropriation bill. My notes are   
not clear on the committee that Gunderson, Goodling, Rukema and Castle 
all sit on, but it may be budget. 
  
I don t know if Cunningham is a  pure opportunist  reactionary (as is  
Newt Gingrich, a man who once co-authored a bill to legalize marijuana 
for cancer patients), a  true believer  libertarian type (a la Barry 
Goldwater), or a  not wrapped too tight  dingbat (a la John Briggs,  
Michael Huffington,  Bullet  Bob Dornan and Sonny Bono), but that tends   
to be what the Southern California GOP serves up. In this case,  
opportunism is good. If Cunningham wants to go onto a larger stage later  
(for example, Pete Wilson was once mayor of San Diego, a very weak 
position from the point of view of formal power, and now he s got a  
50-50 chance of being on the  96 national ticket for the GOP). Every 
California Republican expects to be president someday. But the arts play  
a major role in California, both commercial and nonprofit. And failing 
to authorize the NEA is one way to get identified as an ideologue. He  
could "authorize" the NEA without voting for its appropriation, for  
example, and accomplish some real good.  
  
We need to let him know that this is a high-profile issue and that he is  
being watched closely. Can anybody in San Diego give us more details?  
  
I should note that last time the NEA came up, Cunningham voted against 
its appropriation and went so far as wave a check for $2,000 to the San   
Diego Symphony (I m not certain that that was the agency), saying that 
this is how the arts deserve to be funded. Gingrich copied this gesture   
this year right down to the dollar figure (his donation was the  
Corporation for Public Broadcasting). 
  
If the NEA gets authorized in both houses, but appropriated only in the   
Senate, its chances of making it through the conference committees is  
much better. So Cunningham is the key.   
  
I should note that I share a lot of the same reservations about the NEA   
that just about every poet has, certainly every progressive poet. But I   
agree with Luigi Bob completely that we should not aid Helms, Gingrich 
et al by airing those problems at an inopportune moment. I d rather  
communicate those directly to the folks at the NEA (and I have, from 
time to time). The lit program receives 16.85 percent of all  
applications at the NEA, even tho lit gets only 3.05 percent of the  
program's funds. I too have doubts over the Lit Program's commitment to   
funds for individuals over programs (it has the highest percentage of  
funding for individual artists of any NEA program). However, I noted 
that seven of the current winners (there were just 37) were writers I  
read and pay attention to. Frankly, just under 20 percent's not that 
bad.  
  
Maybe Jack Krick or someone can get us the phone and fax #s for these  
people. Let's do it!

A lot of this discourse is interesting, but I question whether it leads   
to many of the values being alluded to for the work. This discourse does  
not proceed at the level of the poetry. I don't believe it. Nor do I 
believe much space is being added for this different, fabulous work, this 
dark horse that may be too dark to recognize or see.

In-Reply-To:  Message of Fri, 27 Jan 1995 19:26:37 -0700 from

How can there be a decisive break with the past when the past is neither  
decisive nor is the break? I have two responses to Lightman which I have  
been thinking about a lot this weekend and I'm going to sound pompous as hell 
but that hasn't stopped me before and it only proves I am interested.  
 First, the manifesto. This is not a break at all with the past and it  
in fact repeats old conflict. It in fact only sees those conflicts that   
have been handed down to it from, where, the past?  Freud and Jung?   
Not really interesting anymore. Lacan and Butler would be perhaps a little  
more interesting. Maybe. Irigaray and Steinem? Who? What about Sedgewick  
and Wittig? Derrida? Which Derrida? Where's Bhabha, Haraway, Acker?  
 My point is not to parade a list of names, but to demonstrate how much 
this list seems determined by a past that is not at all broken with. Nor  
should it.Nor can it be.  
 Not that there isn't anything of interest in both the manifesto and to 
a greater extent the work. There is the possibility of great confusion which  
seems interesting. I'm interested in the reference to Gaiman. It seems to me  
that there may be room for a messier poetics to come. Not sure this is it,  
but may be a proper direction. When I think of L school poetry and poetics, 
I think of a very pure poetry, in its engagement of its materials. Could  
be a legitimate response to muddy up the waters.  
 But if there is going to be this Jung stuff, then forget it  frankly.  
There is a lot more interesting things happening out there and a return,  
and I do mean return, to crypto-fascist mysticism instead of say a hybrid 
(to jargon bait a little) form of cultural community won't be able to compete.  
 There may be something to this, and its probably not fair to judge   
a movement on the basis of one guys work over an impersonal medium, but I 
think it is important to be very very aware of the past, to break with or 
to build with. And I believe also that the difference between mainstream  
poetry and avant-oppositional-experimental-whatever poetry is how well it is  
theorized. Mainstreamers don't bother to do that at all and as such, they 
are just not that interesting. Thus it'scrucial for any movment to compete  
theoretically as well as poetically. To pick the right voice.

Chris, Spencer and all: I understand the frustrations and the anxieties very  
well. I've just got on the list not too long ago and already I've been in more  
wars then I can remember. Probably my fault, certainly, but what I want to say  
is that I think these have as well as being stressful been very stimulating.  
I've been forced to think about poetry and poetics thanksto Chris and Tom,  
and Ron and Steve, in ways I would never have before. Brecht-like, I say, 
you've made me think and I don't think that is a bad thing. 
 I think the list is doing what well what it should do.

Subject:  Espousing Update 1/30 
  
A quick overview of what transpired on 1/28: 
  
*We estimate that 500 people turned out for  
Freely Espousing events on Saturday. (This 
figure does not include the many people who  
attended Woodland Pattern's benefit reading  
in Milwaukee.)   
  
*While it is difficult to estimate the amount  
of mail generated, we do know that between 
New York City and Providence at least 150  
letters and 250 postcards were generated.  
Actual numbers for the combined events are 
probably safely estimated at somewhere   
around 700 pieces of mail.  In our push to 
Outwrite the Right, we made a good start.  
  
*Here in Providence, we had sympathetic coverage  
from the Providence Journal.  A substantial article 
appeared in the Sunday ProJo entitled: "Writers gather  
in Providence to fight cuts in Endowment" (by John  
Castellucci, 29 Jan 95: B3).  Rather than focusing  
on our "big name" speakers, Castelluci reported on  
the small press crowd: the Waldrops, Jennifer Moyer 
of Moyer Bell, Peter Gizzi, Lee Ann Brown, and Sianne 
Ngai were all cited.  The article closed with words 
from Keith Waldrop's _Potential Random_! 
 Jena Osman reports that at least two Buffalo 
t.v. stations covered her event, and WBFO (the NPR  
station there) has run two pieces on the event.   
 Cole Heinowitz expects coverage of the San   
Diego event in today's San Diego Union.  
 On a more modest note, Brown's campus daily is 
beginning a three part series on FE and on the 
right's attack of federal arts funding more generally 
today.  
  
*We have compiled field reports from the various sites  
and we hope to have time, by late today, to post again  
with info about the specific shape the various programs 
took. 
  
*As one of our organizers remarked, making sure Saturday's  
events went smoothly was like "tending a wildfire."  To 
all the people who so tended, our very deep thanks.

Subject:  Re: Espousing Update 1/26  
  
Jeffrey,  
Let me know if you find anything interesting in your forays into contemporary 
conservative political thought; to my mind, an anti-immigrant movement or a 
desire to keep the U. S. culture pure means no more today than it did when  
the Know-Nothings tried it in the 19th century.  I don't consider fear of the 
unknown a viable or useful political or cultural philosophy.  
  
  I, like Ron Silliman, find that many writers I read have gotten individual  
awards (not to mention benefitting from funded presses, mags, etc., through 
the pittance given the lit program). That's a good thing, to my mind, which 
is the only one I can speak for.  *The People* (some say) don't find their  
values represented in NEA/NEH funding decisions.  I don't believe that.   
 Let's give the NEA and NEH bigger advertising budgets so they can circulate  
their truths.  Then we might be able to talk about it.  In the meantime, I  
distrust anyone who claims to speak for American values (Chomsky does read  
this well, I agree); the main American value I personally see as having come  
out of the recent elections is that the overwhelming majority of citizens 
lead private lives very distant from the machinations of policy-making and  
choose not to participate (or at least don't actively seek to vault the   
blocks preventing their participation).  
  
Generally speaking, I think that it's in the interest of a healthy state to 
help support an avant-garde that will question the values the state puts  
forth as mainstream.  A state that becomes intolerant of and seeks to  
eliminate such non-mainstream voices is, to my mind, that much less healthy.  
When cost of such programs is called a main issue and we're talking about 65  
cents a person, then the distortions have reached an obscene level to my  
mind.  I resist the current rhetoric that persists in such mislabelling under 
the umbrella of traditional values.  My own values are insulted.  You may be  
right, it may be cultural war, but I know what side I'm on if that's true 
(and so do you, I'd suspect).

Eric Pape is missing my point but, ah well. For what it's worth, I know some  
history, and I have read all the writers Eric Pape mentions, could indeed 
argue out reasons against each, mainly covered by my point "non-Freudian  
not neo-Freudian post-structuralism, if any", which was in the manifesto. The 
line before my line about "Jung not Freud" sets what I meant: the utterly 
rationalist, that's religious therefore dumb, line pervades everywhere in 
Language Writing and indeed on POETICS. "Jung rather than Freud", if you  
want. So many buy into Freud, and not into Jung even a little; fascist 
connections don't make the rest of Pound unreadable, and not Jung either; 
Freud's connections with countless molesters of children should rule him  
out totally of consideration by the same logic, but I don't like the logic, 
applied to Jung or Freud. If you look, Eric, at the start of Lacan's ecrits,  
you will see he raises exactly my point, that Freudians attack religion but 
are not religious. I thought I'd make the point without explicit reference  
to Lacan, as Lacanians would get it anyway (some hope). You've also missed  
everything I said about painting and music. Ah well.

Hi Chris, 
  
I just got the Dec issue of Poetic Briefs in the mail from Elizabeth: it  
and your own response to my posting are reasons why I'd like to get to a  
continent where I can write to, meet and telephone some people who've read  
the same books with the same mix of part enthusiasm part reservation and  
thresh that all out till we write our way into new ways forward. Perhaps  
the worse the state of the U.S., the more the writers will be shook up to 
write better?

It is quite possible that I missed the point of Ira's posting. I don't deny 
that, nor did I mean to imply that I somehow know more names than he and as 
such am more qualified, though I admit it sounded that way even to me after 
I read it.  
 My point is that the past has never been fixed, thus no break. The   
enterprose is flawed in itself and I tried to demonstrate that the conflicts  
mentioned are perennial, not new. 
 And as far as Jung goes, I'm just not interested. Remember also that 
Lacan's point was not that God exists, but that s/he is unconscious, as   
for example is woman, which also doesn't exist. I'm not claiming, by the  
way, that this is any more interesting.  
 Anyway, thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

Dear Eric, I'm not saying this forum is a bad thing. I'm saying it's 
important to interrogate the discourse (some of it, at least) as much as  
the participants seem to want to interrogate each other.  
Dear Chris, Thank you for yr response, yr honesty and willingness to step 
back. I'm not sure sending poems is the answer, though I wouldn't rule it 
out either. As I say above, there are times when the overall discourse 
deserves more critique than the positions individuals are taking.  
I admit that I don't buy this "theory is practice" thing.  I know people  
can be very articulate in that direction and I know there's not always a  
clear line between the two and I know theory can be helpful to practice.  
But it can also be a negative, a weapon, a suit of armor, a 
self-promotion, an excuse to revel in one's intellect and ability to 
rationalize.  
Or maybe theory/practice is not the issue. Maybe the issue is the  
relation between the social discourse of writers and the work. Here again 
the discourse is helpful and even necessary, but it can also be  
destructive and counterproductive. Maybe more attention should be paid to 
the dark side here, to the ways this discourse may close off space or  
possibilities.   
My other suggestion would be to encourage those who don't participate to  
get involved, offer their two cents, or reconsider their silence. Perhaps 
it's natural that few do most of the talking, but it's certainly not 
preferable. I will even say it doesn't seem right that so many signed on  
here seldom if ever jump in.

Here are the office phone #s for the members of Congress who will  
determine whether or not the NEA gets funded. Also included are their  
snail mail addresses (LHOB = Longworth House Office Building, I believe;  
RHOB = Rayburn; I don;t what the C is for).  
  
As I noted in my last email, Cunningham is the person who will have the   
most impact. Michael, Jerry, Rae -- you can have the most impact of all   
the people on the list. Steve/Jennifer, call in your old San Diego 
friends.  
  
My experience as a lobbyist in the mid-70s (when I stopped over $240 
million in construction funds for new prisons) taught me two things  
worth remembering: 
  
1) Almost all legistlation comes down to one or two interested members 
who basically trade their pet projects with each other to make up  
coalitions and majorities. These are the folks for the NEA. 
  
2) It is awfully easy to halt spending, much harder to start it. The NEA  
is up against the wall.

Thanks to Ron for the concise breakdown of key 
legislators on the NEA issue.  On Randy "Duke" 
Cunningham, I understand from Cole Heinowitz 
in San Diego that a group of people stayed 
after *Freely Espousing* wrapped up on Saturday   
to discuss ways of working on him.  Cole mentioned  
a tentative plan to work with the Escondido Arts  
Center (Escondido is "Duke"'s district) and possibly  
the mayor of SD to get a meeting with Cunningham. 
  
If anyone has information that could help in this 
effort, please pass it along, either via e-mail to  
us or by phone directly to Cole.  
  
Cole's phone number is 619-291-4945.  She is working  
with Deedee Halleck (of Paper Tiger TV & Video),  
Roderigo Toscano, and several other people on this. 
  
And Ron--did your contacts mention a time-line for  
the House appropriations process?  I'm assuming the 
curve is shorter there than in the Senate's reauthorization 
process, but precise info would be highly valuable. 
  
We won't have time to post a detailed update on 1/28  
this evening (our lives--more or less suspended for 
the past two weeks--demand some attendance just now). 
We'll get something to the list shortly.

Yes, I agree theory often functions in this way.  It's also a way to 
market yourself, especially in terms of academic jobs.  If you want to eat  
on the university meal ticket, you'd better be able to argue convincingly 
if not arrogantly. 
  
However, there are other times where you need a thorough and convincing   
polemical stance to accomplish some "good" means.  What if you were on a  
senate panel with Jesse Helms?  What if you were a Language Poet in 1980  
and you saw what was passing as good writing and good teaching?  
  
Thanks to the L poets (and Tony Door), the field is now wide open.  I  
would like clarification from the M on why they want to narrow down the   
present opening to one acceptable "lyric" mode.

 Welcome to the Poetics List. 
  
Please note that this is a private list and information about the list should 
not be posted to other lists or directories. The idea is to keep the list to  
those with specific rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale 
of the  list small and the volume managable.  Word-of-mouth (and its 
electronic equivalents) seems to be working fine: please feel  free to invite 
people you know to sign-up.  It is easier for me if they sign-up by themselves  
AND send me (bernstei@ubvms) a note telling me how they heard about the list.  I
will send them *this* document in reply. 
  
To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to   
  
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu  
  
Leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message blank.  In the 
body of your e-mail message type: 
  
  review poetics 
  
(The shorter bitnet address is listserv@ubvm. All further 
references to "Listserve" are to this listserve.) 
  
The list has open subscriptions.  You can sub or unsub by sending a one-line  
message, with no subject line, to the listserv address: 
  
unsub poetics Jill Jillway  
  
{or}  
  
sub poetics Jill Jillway  
  
I will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. 
  
ARCHIVES  
  
There are two ways to get archives.  The easiest way is to use the archives 
of the list at the Electronic Poetry Center (EPC), for which see the end of 
this message.  The other way is described below:  
  
Anyone interested in an archive of all postings after March may  
send this message to "Listserve": 
  
index poetics 
  
or  
  
index poetics f=mail 
  
You will receive a list of archived files in a format that  
includes something like this: 
  
* rec  last - change 
* filename filetype GET PUT -fm lrecl nrecs date time 
  
  POETICS  LOG9403  ALL OWN V  80  1012 94/05/31 07:17:17

You can then send the "get" command to "Listserve" in the format:  
  
get filename filetype  (eg: get poetics log9403   
  get poetics log9403   
  get poetics notebook) 
  
or  
  
get filename filetype f=mail  
  
depending on which log file you want (you can also get multiple  
files with one message).  Note that each of the files has a 
different beginning and end date, eg LOG9404 starts 7 March and  
goes to 31 May and that dates overlap. Go figure!  "Poetics 
Notebook" is an anomalous name for what is, in effect, another   
log file.

The Center continues to provide access to the electronic poetry  
and poetics journal, RIF/T, and the archives of the Poetics List.  
Needless to say, the EPC provides quality archival materials for 
these resources. For the Poetics archive, a feature has recently 
been added to allow keyword searching for the immense number of  
files comprising this archive.  
  
The EPC author library offers texts and/or information about  
contemporary poets in a variety of formats.  
  
A number of electronic journals are archived and distributed by  
the EPC. Journals distributed through the EPC differ from other  
e-journal archives in a significant way: the texts presented here  
have been checked and verified by their issuing agency, thus at  
least getting to you versions of electronic journals that have a 
direct link to their source. We are delighted to offer these  
journals to you and will continue to make sure texts presented   
are done so in collaboration with their producers. For resources 
outside the EPC, we have written links to make seamless 
connections to these resources. It is our aim to be vigilent  
about our links so that persons interested in poetry and poetics 
do not have to spend a lot of time digging for addresses, 
remembering sites, and locating resources. Through the selections  
available at the EPC, users of the system have simple and direct 
access to many other related Internet resources.  
  
The Center also provides information about contemporary little   
magazines and small presses engaged in poetry and poetics. Since 
this information is often difficult to locate, it is presented at  
the EPC in hopes of recongizing these contributions, facilitating  
communication, and providing an additional outlet for these 
extremely valuable print sources. Look here also for Selby's List  
of Experimental Magazines.  
  
The Poetry & Poetics Document Archive provides access to a number  
of documents of use to poets, teachers, and researchers. Here you  
will find essay material and current obituaries. This area should  
be consulted in conjunction with the Poetics Files and Small  
Press Sources areas, which also offer material of pedagogical 
use.  
  
The EPC also presently offers gallery, sound, exhibts, and an 
announcements area.

2.0 Poetry and the Electronic Place  
  
Compared to say, a year ago, many people might agree that the 
idea of some sort of an electronic forum for poetry is not only a  
possibility but an inevitability. We have seen the continued  
growth of the Poetics List (I counted around 250 postings the 
month of December 1994 alone) and the development of the  
Electronic Poetry Center. The EPC has maintained a significant   
circulation. We regularly get letters from various world outposts  
attesting to the reality of such connectivity. Interesting also  
are the number of visits taking place, both locally and across   
distance; despite the dips and peaks that typify any active 
place, the EPC has seen a good amount of traffic across its 
doorstep. For those with such inclination (and it is illuminating  
that the following compare favorably with circulation statistics,  
say, for a little magazine) here are some numbers:  
  
_Month_   _Connects_  
Nov 1994  573  
Oct 1994  429  
Sep 1994  367  
August 1994 348  
July 1994 614  
June 1994 110  
  
These statistics give only a sense of scale, it should be noted, 
since direct connections to EPC submenus and entries through  
Veronica searches, a significant number of connects, are not  
included in the above statistics. 
___________________________________________________________________  
  
3.0 Interface: Gopher, Web, Mosaic   
  
Even as activities converge, it is also the time of divergent 
interfaces. I am often surprised by the number of our 
contributors and participants who do not even have gopher access.  
(These, again, not represented in the above statistics.) Most 
people, we figure, have at least gopher access, though Web access  
is quickly becoming a standard. Mosaic, it would be assumed,  
though assuming predominance in the University setting, has 
hardly become a reality for most dial-up users, particularly  
internationally. (For the sake of a common ground, gopher is an  
ascii-based interface that offers access through the selection of  
menus; the web is an ascii-based interface that offers access 
through _screens_ of information with links to other areas  
appearing as highlighted text; Mosaic is a graphical interface   
basically superimposed on the Web structure that offers images,  
sound, video, and allows you to use your mouse as a navigational 
tool.) The EPC is accessible through any of these interfaces. It 
is presently evolving strongly towards exclusive Web/Mosaic 
access. 
  
_Informational Notes_: (1) The standard for Web/Mosaic documents 
is the markup protocol called html. These are imbedded codes that  
you will see once in a while when you download an html document. 
These codes give instructions to the software about highlighting,  
fonts, and screen layout, as well as providing for the _hot 
links_ that make possible Web/Mosaic navigation. (2) A feature of  
these interfaces that should be mentioned is the bookmark. You   
may wish to investigate this as most systems allow you to set a  
bookmark, say at the EPC, and gain immediate access to it when   
you invoke your interface.  
___________________________________________________________________  
  
4.0 RIF/T Notes  
  
Forthcoming from RIF/T are two special issues. The first of these  
is the Transpoeisis issue (see EPC Announcements for details) 
which will offer a muti-faced and multi-format approach to the   
presentation of translations. Also forthcoming, a planned special  
issue on Charles Olson. RIF/T will also soon issue the first in a  
series of special chapbooks. Much on the way!

A naive question from the unlearned:  
  
Would someone please articulate in what ever fashion possible some 
general practices/theories of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry?  What a hassle to   
type that.  I won't hold anyone responsible for the reductive nature of   
categorizing what is (obviously) a highly diverse assortment of writers   
and writing.  Ok?

Well, I would say that I'm sure that while there are similarities, the 
particular purposes to which such attitudes are harnessed speak to are 
different--at least to the extent that that was then and this is now.  
What more precisely do you see as the similarities though?  How did that  
turn out?  And, again, simply for the perverse interest I have in what 
"those" folks are saying, perhaps you don't consider it a viable or  
useful political/cultural philosophy but there are others who are using   
it successfully to garner and wage power.  Unfortunately. 
  
In the meantime, I

American, then, would seem to equate with something very unpleasant--at   
least in our eyes.  But while I agree most choose not to participate, it  
is particularly disturbing that those who do not agree with that version  
of America don't vote; or, another way, those that do agree with that  
version of America do vote.  There's a poetics of America here that I  
would like, some day, to articulate--perhaps it's been done, but to set   
it in terms of the present need be done.  Any suggestions, in terms of 
poetry of who's doing this?  I think of Ginsberg, obviously, but who else?  
  
On another note: I have been in favor of proportional representation and  
continue to think that our system is too anachronistic (sp?) to  
"re-present" the plurality that is America.  La, la, la....

And there is an interesting point to make here: is an avant-garde  
antithetical to the mainstream?  Isn't it by definition?  I would argue   
that it's just the opposite of how you describe it: a state has an 
obligation to delimit, maintain, police, and exclude those voices which   
question its power, authority, and ability to narrate its existence.  You 
know?  Yes, though, you're completely right: the state is unhealthy when  
it seeks to eliminate voices.  And it is about as sick as I've ever seen  
it. 
  
  
My own values are insulted.  You may be

Yes, so are mine.  Constantly.  I read with great disappointment today 
that the smithsonian will exhibit the enola gay without comment.  A  
victory for a representation of war and America (perhaps I should use a   
little "a" for now on) as entirely justified in its destruction of 
thousands of lives--as if to question that perception were tantamount to  
treason.  It frightens me greatly that alternative views of that horrible 
event cannot be funded or articulated; though, at the same time, I don't  
think that questioning of our actions (dropping the bomb) has ever been   
stronger than at present. And yes, I know what side I'm on.  I just want  
to know what it is that's being said, who's saying it, and why.  It's  
hard to argue with the opposition if you don't know what they're 
arguments are--an obvious point, I'm sure. 
  
One last item:  I've been reading Micheal Berube's new book Public 
Access.  It's a wonderful examination of the culture wars and attacks on  
academia, especially as it tries to correct the distortions of the right  
about higher education.  Particulary in the literary studies area.  But   
what I find most valuable about it is that it seeks to engage a wider  
audience than a strictly theoretical readership--something long overdue   
at this juncture.

Hey, yeah!  You know what, though, I'm not sure we have a discourse here, 
as is being said.  Sometimes we do, as discussions on Apex, experiment 
show; other times it seems to waffle in this vague, disembodied  
dislocation of personal interrogations.  I guess, if I were to make a  
suggestion along these lines, it would be (as Tom Mandel might   
suggest, if I might be so bold) to be more specific.  What is the  
discourse of L poetry that is under question, whose practice and why is   
under consideration.  Poems, poems, practice and theory.  
  
In another sense, too, perhaps the extant discourse is closing off 
something that needs to be accounted for--what are we not talking about?  
The connection of social discourse to writers seems interesting.  What 
does it mean in terms of specific writers?

Yes, I agree.  Perhaps some basic questions might help.  What are we 
interested in?  Who are we interested in and why?  Why did we join the 
poetics listserv?  For myself I thought it a good channel to supplement   
my interactions with other people, with other views about poetry and 
poets.  Duh, huh?  It's turned into much more than that, though.  Bosnia, 
Freely Espousing, Academia and the work world. . . .  How marvelous. 
Just what I wanted.  
  
I also joined because I was very interested in Charles Bernstein's work   
and hoped to listen in on what he had to say about poetry and his own  
work; I have Dark City and am very intrigued and amused, though I don't   
claim to understand.  I laugh a great deal.  I think of television and 
commercials, as if he's doing a pastiche, clashing and inserting various  
ranges of discourse--a very perverse inversion of Eliot's "I can 
connect/Nothing with nothing."  I don't know.  It's fun and I hope to  
keep learning from my reading of it--any suggestions? 
  
I'll leave off here--for no particular reason.

words must be read in context. read my words in   
context, not as an abstract opposition of poetry  
and theory but as a contextualized one. sure,  
theory (or criticism, or history, whatever) is 
also an art activity, an art form, a form of 
writing, what have you. And yet.... are we 
to succumb to the idea that there is no  
difference between Moses Und Aaron and

enough. What use to react to it in a way that  
is no reaction at all?

Subject:  Spirits, etc. 
  
Just to clarify. This is as true as stories get.  
 My great-grandmother and her sister sit at the kitchen table. The wind 
heaves sheets of sand at the screen door. They're telling me about the lost 
people of the lost country of Mu, on the lost continent of Lemuria. These 
are the first people, on the first world. The strange words you hear just 
before you fall asleep is their language.  
 We and Elves and Martians are related to the Lemurians. Aunt Alice   
mentions how once she traveled in a dream to Mars and taught the women 
there to use ladles, because before they had only their tongues to scoop  
up the thin soup they cook on that planet. 
 My great-grandmother mentions how once she opened up her closet door 
to find Elves dining with spiders, but they didn't have enough to eat so  
she poached an egg for them. As a result, all the black widows that plagued 
her garage left for the desert over night. 
  
 Making them principles does not serve spirits. 
 There is no compassion in racial memory.  
 Engendering stereotypes does not create a community. 
 We are related to the first people by language.  
 We do live in a world where Martians need to be taught to use 
 a ladle and where Elves should be fed.  
 That this story came from my family is not insignificant, because 
 spirituality *cannot* be faked.

Dear Bill, What is a "thorough and convincing polemical stance" in the 
U.S. Congress? I shudder to think... As for L poets, I give them credit   
for opening things up in certain ways, but it's also true that the 
openings they accomplished were only partial, and that there were  
closings which also resulted. I wouldn't call the field today "wide  
open." If it were so, there'd be more unique, original work than I 
believe there is.  
Dear Jeffrey, Be specific, sure. But if you get too specific it will 
again be people talking or arguing about their personal tastes and 
beliefs. Some of that is inevitable and fine, but I think the value of 
this forum would be limited if that's what dominates. There needs to be a 
balance between the general and specific, in my opinion. Otherwise 
there's no basis for communication that different people can relate to.   
Yrs, Spencer Selby 
P.S. Sorry if I seem argumentative. I do appreciate the input from both   
of you.

..but how did he make the argument from the perspective of the practice of  
revolution, since revolutions in art take resources away from the  
political revolution. This was a brave statement for him to make and I 
wonder in what context and in what way he made it, since his argument  
must speak to the questions that are continuously raised about the social 
utility of art. Best, James

Being a fan of Richard Hooker, I find Lew Daly's style remarkably  
independent of the last 300 years of prose writing and yet it has a  
current ring to it; and I wonder how both impressions can be the 
case.  I haven't looked back at it to reply in detail, but if 
you're interested we can take a detailed discussion off-line, since I am  
concerned lest a polemic ensue. Thanks for your interest. Jamse

Ok, ok, I'll try harder.  Let me, then ask, what constitutes a "reaction" 
in your view?  This is not a trick question....

general, though, that I thought ....

Why off-line?  I'd like to see what it is and how you account for it.
