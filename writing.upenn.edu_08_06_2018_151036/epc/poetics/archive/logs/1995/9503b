Dear Jonathan,
 
        I knew Olson through the eyes of those who loved him.
"The ailing Buffalo herd" he once called them, and in fact, I'm
not convinced they ever recovered from the loss his death effected
and so I was moved to remind you, as others have noted, that these
matters are not simply "dead matter" to be used, Thucydides be
damned, for the current economy.
 
        Your post was not disgraceful nor did I intend to chastise
you for your "wicked ways."  It is a small matter to most - and in
this forum folks are reaching for their delete keys.
 
        I welcome continued conversation by private mail.

Mistah Luoma,
 
Is that early modern or early modem?
 
I find that I have a strong ambivalence to Spencer's new book, which is
an ambivalence I have to much (tho not all) "visual poetry." It pushes
the line between "reading" and "looking" in a direction I'm not  that
comfortable with (I'd rather go in the opposite direction, start close
reading adverts in the mags).
 
Spencer's "regular" poems are so terrific that I deeply want to "get"
this work, but then feel pushed out again. It's a reaction I've had to
other visual works by Bernstein, DiPalma and other poets who I'd easily
count among my very favorite, so it's a reaction that puzzles me.
 
Two notable exceptions to this seem to me to be John Byrum (see the work
in Writings from the New Coast) and (from same book!) by Mark Mendel
(might be misspelling that name, sorry). Mendel's work seems to me very
influenced by Jenny Holzer, but with a sense of ear and compression that
I find lacking in her skewed aphorisms.
 
Both of these poets seems to take the visual to the written. Spencer's
work in contrast seems to pose the idea that the visual is a mask for the
written (or vice versa). The images appear "found" -- are the texts
likewise?
 
I'd love for somebody to close read this work and wake up my eyes. I'm
ready to learn!

In-Reply-To:  <6197DE5802BC0080>
 
Rather than just list what I've been reading lately (which consists of
relatively little beyond  recent books in the mail, such as Spencer
Selby's, Snow Crash by Neil Stephanson and Watten's Under Erasure [which
I read and reread the way Libyans read Khadafi's Little Green Book], then
massive numbers of Information Week, CIO, PC Week, Byte and the like for
work), I've been mulling over, rereading a series of "Lost Classics" that
I wish were still in print. I've gone so far as to think about trying to
package a series for a publisher.
 
By and large, these are longpoems, mostly from the 1960s, that I think
everybody should have and read because they're so wonderful:
 
A particular example of this genre would be Robert Kelly's Axon Dendron
Tree (which, with Finding the Measure & 20 Songs will always be the key
Kelly books for me because they arrived at just the right time to help me
with my own development as a poet, so that I have that deep love for them
that goes beyond articulation). Another is Ron Johnson's two Norton
books, Book of the Green Man and Valley of the Many Colored Grasses.
Another is Frank Stanford's battlefield where the moon said i love you
(writing from the job, so may have botched that title some). That may
still exist, tho would be hard to find, as would be the case I should
think with Grenier's Sentences (a "Chinese box" of 500 4x6 cards, the
sort of impossible project that extends Jonathon Brannen's insights sort
of toward a limit), a collection that I think all 1,000 subscribers to
the T-AMLIT list should read. Not to mention everybody here.
 
I think somebody could make the argument that the ideas in my own The
Alphabet are a direct (if transformed) descendant of the conception of
form implicit in Axon Dendron Tree and it still reads wonderfully today.
 
Anyhow, this after that's what seems powerful & moving and worth
mentioning

I remember reading somewhere that at the very famous reading at the Six

work but that of the recently deceased John Hoffman. Given how icon-ized
every other participant of that even has become, I'm surprised that I've
never read any of this poet's work. Does anyone know where one could find
samples?

Dear Ron & Bill,
     There's nothing (besides holding down a regular job) at which I'm
more inept than explicating people's--especially friends'-- works, but you
learn by trying, so here's a take on Spencer's _Malleable Cast_. I'm going
to try to stay away from a "close reading" approach, which has more to do
with my inability to articulate, specifically, what interests me about
this work than whether or not such a "close reading" (or mis-reading)
might prove valuable.
     Much of Spencer's non-visual poetry has (my take only) to do with what
I'd call "depolarization"--working with opposites (ideas, images, etc.) in
an effort to work through apparent dichotomies, but doing so not toward a
resolution so much as maybe a (this is going to sound silly) "shimmering
effect." If you like longpoems, Ron, check out Gerald Burns' _Letters to
Obscure Men_; it ends with thirty-six 21-line sections, placed two on a
page, the second on each page "restating" the first. It's Gerald's belief
that the resulting "poem" on each page is not the two poems actually
there, but that which resonates "between" them. It's an effect I've yet to
actually experience there, though this, to some extent, does seem to
describe what I "get" from much of Spencer's work.
     Spencer's impulses toward the visual (& toward/through apparent
dichotomies) come, I think, from having been a movie fanatic at a fairly
early age, especially of film noir. His interests resulted in at least one
published book, _Dark City_, a study of the film noir, published by St.
James Press (a reissue of an earlier edition, from McFarland & Company) in
1984. The photographs Spencer chose to include in _Dark City_ (I'm
assuming Spencer chose them) look very much like the raw material "founds"
of some of his visual pieces--though he avoids using film stills in his
visual poetry. My own take is that film noir as a rule seems to be,
generally, a visually rich genre, lots of accentuated (even bizarre)
camera angles, much dark/light contrast--the result, I think, of there
having been at the time in Hollywood a lot of emigrated German
cinematographers who'd done earlier work on German expressionist movies.
(Spencer could tell you whether or not that's accurate.) Many of the
"found" images in Spencer's work remind me very much of expressionist
paintings & films, & I don't think that's an accident. Spencer's work
isn't expressionistic, though it does use perhaps some of its elements.
     I said I wasn't going to "close read." Well, okay, so I'm a big
fucking liar. Turn to the page in _Malleable Cast_ (no page numbers given)
of the buckets on the stairwell, water flowing from the top bucket into
the next on the next step down, overflowing & then into the next bucket
down, overflowing there & down into the next. (Sort of looks like a Rube
Goldberg detail, eh?) Now, read the words overlayed onto this image.
 
        I think that this ambivalence i
        found in art today. On the o
        sary to suspect that art's involv
        clean conscience to peo
        selves up [illeg.] erything else. O
        up and [illeg.] from the world
        warm [illeg.] here they doze o
        speration and [illeg.] that are sy
        their lives. As though art flew
        hard enough. But [illeg.] again
        iew that's present with [illeg.]
        nd possibility. We'd see artists
        bing what a truly creative life co
        nderstood as the making of an off
        hing as life understood as perm
 
     Of course, when you look at this, the buckets dissuade reading, at
least initially, the text from left to right: what happened with me was
that, after recognizing the buckets on stairwell & water flowing down via
buckets, my eye caught certain words & phrases on the page: "art today";
"conscience"; "the world"; "they doze"; "enough"; "possibility"; "life
understood."  (What anyone picks up looking initially will obviously
differ from person to person.)
     The buckets on stairwell create a waterfall, a human-created
waterfall, something we might even recognize (given the verbal clues) as
"art." The image--given the Rube Goldbergesque impracticability of moving
water this way--might also strike one as funny. (It struck me so.)
     Spencer seems to be playing here with ideas about art ("Making of an
off/ [t]hing as life understood as perm[anent]"), and the ideas & visual
resonances I found I was picking up "reading" this piece seem to be if not
mutually exclusive opposites, certainly nothing tidily pat. The *idea* of
the buckets struck me as funny, but the image itself was actually, on
second glance, quite lovely--a tension's created between that specific
"idea" and (one of) the visual effects. We aren't "allowed" to read the
whole text, it having been cut on both ends, and illegible in spots where
the buckets've been placed over it. This gives a very "fluid" effect to
the words on the page, certain words or phrases bob & rise as though
afloat--again something reinforced for me by the image of water flowing
down the page. Spencer has--at least in this visual poem--managed to (for
this viewer) put everything into motion, despite the initial visual stasis
of a block of words overlayed over a fairly static black & white
line-drawing.
     Well, it's late & I'm out of cigarettes. I don't know if any of the
above "explains" anything, or helps--but it's something, I guess. I'd like
to hear what anyone else who's seen this book might have to say about it,
or what Spencer might have to say about my "reading" of one of its pages.
This type of book isn't for everyone, and even I think some of the pieces
in it are more successful than others, but I do want to say that I've been
picking it up at least once a day since I got it a week or so ago, &
continue to be inspired by it.
 
     Yours,
 
     Gary

If Charles Olson really was a shy and gentle person, it is a shame
that he is not alive to hire a lawyer, a public relations firm, and
some radio time to rehabilitate his reputation.
 
Seriously, if there was a side of Olson that does not get into the
books about Olson, then it had better be convincingly recorded before
those who know that side have disappeared too.
 
To those not part of his flock he sounds pretty overbearing. It
sounds as if Jonathon Williams (I now remember that's the right
spelling, I think) is still alive--well, he struck me as an honest
person and he knew Olson as well as anybody. Let J. W. speak!

Gary,
 
That's a terrific reading! And I didn't know that we had more than one
Dark City author on this list either.
 
But I wonder how much of the concealment/revealment dynamics (a
sizeable portion of your reading) don't actually reiterate themselves on
every page in the book. What about the cole miners (on the cover and
inside a few pages beyond the cascading buckets)? Or the blindfolded
women? How do you read those pages differently? The horse playing a
flute?
 
There seems to be a deliberate irony set up throughout between these
consciously retro images (in the same way that rubber stamp works all
use iconography from the 1930s to early 50s) and the often philosophic
texts that underlay them. So that in the man with a drill, in the most
legible portion of the page, one reads:

Ron,
 
        I couldn't agree with you more re RK's AXON DENDRON TREE (&
most of the others on your lost classics list). A couple years back I
thought I had convinced Pat & Marla Smith (NOTUS & OTHERWIND PRESS) to
reprint AXON DENDRON TREE -- only to find out that RK had convinced
them to do his new longish poem MONT BLANC, a lovely work, btw. There
exists thus an electronic version of ADT, as Pat had set the poem -- &
I have mentioned to Loss that this wld also be the kind of work
eminently suited to the purposes of the Poetry Archive. I haven't had
time to talk to RK (hello Robert) about it, but will, & have done so
herewith as he is a reader of this list.
 
        Except for Grenier's book, most all of your "lost classics"
cld in fact be brought back into a electronic poetry archive, until
some gutenbergian enthusiast is ready to reprint them. Or does that
sound like some cyber-holding tank or some post-xtian limbo 'twixt
pardiso of print & inferno of o.p.?

Great reading Gary. This is exactly the sort of thing we should be doing more
of, at least to my relatively unschooled mind.
     One of the things I deeply regret about being in Baton Rouge is the near
impossiblity of finding texts from any but the more big name small presses
(Sun & Moon, etc.). Thus I'd like to ask to list in general if they know of a
better way of ordering than to use the friendly neighborhook book store. What
we need is some type of archive of presses, something like the poetry center's,
but perhaps more comprehensive? Maybe even an electronic distribution center,
like spd, but electronic? Something like you send by e-mail a list of books
and they can get it backto you? Does something like that exist?
     I ask that because I'm very interested in Spencer's book, as well as
others listed here, but am not looking forward to a several months wait
while various distributors try to find each other, as has happened before
to me in B.R.
    Anyway, again, thanks to Gary and Ron for the readings, Eric.

Dear H.T. Kirby-Smith,
 
Actually, Jonathan Williams' first name is spelled just like Jonathan
Brannen's: with two "a"s. He's still alive, and still sending out
manuscripts (while temping at a nonprofit press here in MN a couple of
months ago "we" received a collection of some of his "bawdy" verk). He might
well write about Olson, though you couldn't force him, of course.
 
You COULD, however, "force" (or coerce) him to talk to YOU about Olson.
Some of my favorite things to read are "oral histories," of people,
places, "things." (For instance, Studs Terkel's _Work_, which I LOVE.)
Maybe you might consider going to Williams w/tape recorder, getting him
to talk about Olson. Then, moving on to others who knew him--document an
"oral history" of the guy. It's probably something you could get
published fairly easily. (Though doing it would be difficult, & require a
lot of traveling.) You'd want to talk to Cid Corman probably, who I
think's in Japan, not doing terribly well financially, I've heard.
 
Here in MN there's an agency that funds nothing but travel expenses for
various "critical/research" writings. Maybe there's such an agency in
your area? Maybe worth looking into...
 
Yours,
 
Gary

I have been working to compile all the Segue catalogs together into one
document and I think the project is nearly done. I am trying to get a
copy of each book in the catalog into an archive which I am compiling and
obviously that takes a bit longer. Meanwhile I will try to get an
electronic copy or at least a paper copy to you and anyone who wants to
see it. Please let me konw if you do.

Dear TH Kirby-Smith:
 
Yeah, that's a problem the dead have, especially when the living set
out to sharpen their personal and poetical axes. If you are actually
interested in this issue, there's two places to start. One is with
Olson's poetry which, regardless of what anybody says about the man,
speaks for itself. The second place would be Ralph Maude's
newsletters, which Peter Quartermain mentioned in a recent post. Maude
has taken it upon himself to deal with the hatchet job Tom Clark
performed on Olson, through minute and careful examination of the record,
especially as it is to be recovered in the documents. Come to think of
it, there is a third place: Charles Boer's marvelous essay, *Charles
Olson in Connecticutt*. Your notion of "flocks" seems to reveal a
certain prejudice on your part. If you're willing to move beyond that,
you might be surprised what you find, not just about Olson, but about
yourself.
 
Best,
Mike

Greetings all--
 
Jonathan Williams's address (still, I think):
Box 110
Highlands, NC  28741
 
I didn't speak up earlier, but I am currently preparing a critical
edition of Loy's poems.  Its fate probably depends upon the demand (or
lack of) for the forthcoming SELECTED by Roger Conover (from Farrar,
Straus, Giroux);  Conover doesn't want to "flood" the market, though I've
got a zillion potential Loy projects on tap here.  Would love to talk
backchannel with anyone else interested in textual crit. or ML.
 
The recent discussion about the textuality of the physical book was
fascinating-- has anyone seen MY MOTHER'S BOOK, by Joan Lyons?  It's very
moving constructed as a double-hinged folio-- a twin-spined hug built in
paper, which suits the text just fine.
 
The discussions of close reading and textual aspects of book layout etc.
dovetail nicely in my mind around the editing of Loy's work.  I don't
think it is "constraining" at all to consider "just" the text when so
often editors misjudge the extent to which elements of textual
presentation (down to use of ampersands, numbers of dashes, white space
in medias line, and-- hardest of all to determine with Loy--
misspellings) are the "matter" of the work itself.  Susan Howe's piece on
Dickinson (in SULFUR and again in her book on American Lit) has been a
big help.  I think Loy was far more painterly and subversive than she
"looks" in her last two poetry collections (Conover has come I think to
agree)-- the SELECTED will reflect it.
 
Thanks for the fascinating ongoing conversation--
 
Marisa (currently reading Alcott's journals, Anne Porter's poems,
Padgett's translations of Cendrars, and LAMB baaa)

Jonathan Williams is indeed alive and well, and has indeed
spoken on Olson on more than one occasion. The best is
his brief 1976 memoir / portrait "Am--O" reprinted in
his collection of essays _The Magpie's Bagpipe: Selected essays_
San Francisco: North Point, 1982, 6-12.

Long, long, long, this. (Forgive me, scrollers!) Eric Pape (& others
interested in this and other Generator books), the address is at the end
of the post.
 
Dear Ron,
     Hey, many thanks for the kind invite to say more about _Malleable
Cast_. As to the concealment/revealment dynamics, I think you're right,
that's a lot of what seems to be going on here. Whether or not that's
going on each page, I don't know.
     The coal miner would be a great one to talk generally about since, as
you note, it's not only one of the images in the body of the book, it's
also the cover, suggesting a "visual title,"  maybe. When I think of
"mine" I think immediately of Coolidge's _Mine: the one that enters the
stories_, a lovely metaphor-- though an odd way to put it, as you'd think
he'd've used the one "WHO" enters the stories, not "THAT" (which seems to
imply "inhuman").
     "Mine" is a hinge word I hear frequently among poets who, like myself
& Spencer, create a certain amount of our work using (directly or
otherwise) found material. "Mine" as a verb (how one gets the material),
and what it becomes, having done that (the "mined" becomes "mine"). I also
think of this as a somewhat "hack" phrase: one "hacks" when mining, but
it's also, as I say, a word that gets used a lot, with as much frequency
among poets I know as "finding your voice" gets used in workshops. It's
become a cliche, or is fast becoming one.
     Before I bring J.G. Ballard into this (in a moment), here's one of
three epigraphs Spencer uses to preface _Malleable Cast_:
 
          "Our Fire Stone should be prepared and matured, like
          our food and all other medicines, by the corporal fire
          which reigns in the little world. Where the solar fire
          of the great world leaves off, there our corporal fire
          begins a new generation."
                                   --Basilius Valentinus
 
     Spencer has his own reasons for using that epigraph, but what I take
from it ("mine" from it) is that sense of a "minor"  literature (or art)
that seems to be implied by "the little world." Note the distinction above
between the fire of the "little world" and the "solar fire of the great
world." &, where the latter leaves off, is where (so I'm understanding) a
"minor"  literature picks up. (Also note the homonymous nature of "minor"
and "miner.")
     In J.G. Ballard's _Vermilion Sands_, a collection of some of his
earliest published short stories there's a fabulous (in every sense)
story, "The Singing Sculptures," about "sonic" sculpture.  A gallery owner
sells one to a rich art collector, a large statue that "sings" by virtue
of the fact that there's a tape-player in it playing pre-recorded music.
The collector seems to "fall in love" with the statue, the gallery owner
seems to "fall in love"  with the collector. (Seems to because my memory
of the story is only so-so.) The gallery owner records his own voice
singing, apparently love songs, to the collector. The collector ultimately
moves, and takes everything with her, including (so the gallery owner
thinks) the singing statue. It turns out, she'd actually hacked it to
bits; the gallery owner stumbles onto fragments of it, embedded in the
soil, actually *growing* now, and *literally* singing (in the gallery
owner's voice, & not by virtue of tape recorder).
     I've always loved this story (my memory of it) as a kind of fluid
metaphor for (a) the process of making art, & specifically art from
"found" material, and (b) its seeming preferential attitude toward "minor"
works of art. The collector couldn't bear being with the statue (the
"major" artwork here) anymore, she was "so" "in love" with it, & so hacked
it to bits & moved on. The singing sculpture, seductive as it was, was
also (note, by virtue of the tape recorder) a sham. It's not until it's
been hacked to pieces that it, genuinely, sings (if still in the voice of
the gallery owner). (Note that the resulting singing "roots" were the
result of a *collaboration*, which is what art created using found
material is, even if the other collaborators aren't "present" during the
final process.)
     Sentimental? Yes, maybe. Hackneyed? Certainly, & part of its (for me)
charm.
     Ron, you point out the anachronistic nature of the visual material
used, and the second (of 3) epigraphs seems to address that:
 
          The beginning, the awakening, offers itself only at the
          end as its inscription, by the writing of the
          remembrance, in its working out.
                         --Jean-Francois Lyotard
 
     Another possible reason for Spencer's interest in the often (though
not always) "anachronistic" imagery has probably to do with what was
available when he was growing up, when he was young & impressionable, the
things (ideas that images reinforced) experienced then. I remember at a
slide show-reading of Bernadette Mayer's _Memory_ (I think it was),
Barrett Watten asking of Bernadette: "Don't you feel that the cars, the
clothing, the hairdos, the things you've captured on film here, "date"
this piece?" Couldn't tell whether or not "date" was in the "bad" sense of
this word. (Like, the way some people feel about Donald Barthelme's
writing--"period" writing.) Well, Spencer's work, I think, uses so much of
the iconography of the 40s & 50s because that's when he grew up (as
Bernadette's piece was certainly a record of a specific time period), &
the sort of "defining" characteristics, the negative ones at least, of
that particular era are what he seems to be working against in these
visual pieces. I'm going out on a limb with that because only Spencer can
tell you whether or not this, indeed, has anything to do with his
impulses.
     But, "hacking" and "mining" (drilling, too) are, for me, much of
what's going on here (mining memory, personal and cultural, as well as
Salvation Army-type stores for books with these kinds of images). Much of
this work does seem self- referential--to me, at least.
     As far as a "close" reading of any more of these images, maybe I'll
do that with a couple & send them to you by direct e- mail, or snail-mail.
I think it can be done, I'd love to do it, but felt--given the public
nature of this medium--it might be more interesting to those reading
(w/out copies to look at) to talk more generally about the book. (Like,
maybe I think it's "not fair" to talk specifically about something here
since I can't reproduce the actual piece, given its visual nature.)
     Again, I'd really like to hear what Spencer has to say about this
book.
     Thanks again, Ron, for asking. I can't hope to make a convert of you
(or anyone else), & that's not my intention; in fact, as perverse as this
sounds, I really appreciated getting to write about this as it made me
think about my own interest in this sort of work, in "found" work, in
"minor" work, & so on. So, again, many thanks.
     Anyone who hasn't left this post out of total boredom might be
wondering: "Well, heck; how & where do I *get* this book?"  _Malleable
Cast_ was published by John Byrum's
 
     Generator Press
     8139 Midland Drive
     Mentor OH 44060
     U.S.A.
 
     It's $10.00 (not sure if you need to include shipping).  Byrum's
published numerous books & magazines over the year--most (maybe all?)
being visual poetry in one form or another. Write and ask for a catalogue
or list of "in print"s.

Dear Gary,
yr close/intinmate reading of Selby is
fascinating to one who has not seen the book, imagining
the images and text only from what is said -- as
exciting as any 'ancient' ecphrasis for any renaissance
painter.  The pressure on exact indication turns
the prose on I suppose. (I go searching for Ezra
Pound's inistence on description, the
tale of Prof Agassiz's fish)  I am dis-

I would, of course, argue that this is precisely the role of an
electronic poetry archive. For those people really intent on reading
the Many instrumental works branded with the o.p. stamp, there's
little recourse, especially if they are not in the academic circles
that allow funding to travel to special collections, or unless they
know someone with an Extraordinary collection ...
 
op prices are extremely prohibitive - and if one were to make an
argument that electronic versions of texts don't help the author
financially, I would leap in to say that op priced texts help even
less, as the text moves from circulation to an object of
fetishization.
 
Of course, I have seen a number of postings here and there that
electronic copies actually boost sales of print works when both are
available. People in places not sporting comprehensive bookstores like
to browse too...
 
Further, the electronic "fascimile" of the work would offer the text
but would by no means ever preclude its reissuance in print nor (if
currently in print) eclipse a physical presence. I think the recent
flurry of posts on physical parameters of texts would insist on this
as well.

So, not meant to me argumentative here in any way. Pierre and I have
spoken and do agree, methinks, about the place of electronic versions
of some texts.
 
I mean, op only means one of two things in these cases - not
commercially expedient - or - the publisher decided it was time to put
food on the table again, rather than give it to the printers. (Unless
they were also the printer, in which case they might have decided to
cut back from forty hour weeks...)
 
As I say, not to argue anything here but to throw my (not entirely
unbiased) vote in for the electronic editions idea. I say, there are
many many on the list for whom I've found citations for books but
could not find an in print copy. I would guess that in this case for
most interested readers, the text would not get read.
 
As such, a kind of call to those who might be authors of these
classics. Contact me or Ken Sherwood via the list or privately ...
 
My feeling is that we've got a tremendous resource in the Electronic
Poetry Center author library and I turn this "second" to Pierre's motion
into a suggestion that one very productive development of these
valuable discussions of "classics" might be to have them equally at
our fingertips.

Subject:      Re: My Reading Selby
 
"Malleable Cast" can be read as a story, from first to last image. I took the
Basilius Valentinus quote at the beginning to be an alchemical metaphor like
"as above so below" or the transformative effect of spiritual fire creating
and burnishing a soul (our philosopher's stone) into something more than the
grossness of common reality, but at the same time "the ordinary of his
commonplace."
 
 Reading the book as a story has you starting out with the young boy and his
mother going up the metaphorical ladder (she is pushing/helping him) and
ending with the young boy holding his tank or whatever that is in his hands
out to the world. In between you have the magical creative and alchemical
processes formed by word and image that lead to the smiling lad's "patience
of the test of the world. longer passions of there is no" All the images and
text as they appear seem to tell the story of the "remembrance, in its
working out." the Lyotard quote at the beginning of the book.
 
I agree with Gary the images are from the forties and fifties and operate on
a subconscious as well as conscious level to evoke that time in this nation's
world building that has us where we are today. The technology and the medical
diagrams shown here are fascinating frightening and funny. A woman and young
girl stand in profile blindfolded. I had to see this as the way woman were
(still are?) when faced with survival in a culture that is antagonistic to
the inner most value systems we possess. Words float up and then away as you
try to read the poem and the image at the same time. This effect of this book
feels very much like my own creative process where the words just seem to
appear before me and then create an imagelife of their own on the page that
is neither nature nor technology nor biography nor emotions but some other
space wanting to get charted. Responding to this art/visual poetry takes
place in the guts as well as brain - anything less will be pretty cold for
this hot little black and white world.

   Tony--Somehow I managed to get a copy of the hardcover collected at
   a BORDERS bookstore (of all places) as late as 1991--people told me
   that it was impossible--it's out of print--but i somehow "got it"--
   Anyway, i've been reading through it--there are many poems circa 53,54
   that are lyrically quite modest and very intense that didn't make it into
   the SELECTED--these don't get talked about much. People seem to think
   he grew beyond them--but there's something here that often gets eclipsed
   by the more public "i do this" kind of of poem....Chris Stroffolino

In-Reply-To:  <199503150643.BAA20509@panix4.panix.com>
 
My first question concerns Olson. Since I logged on here I have been
catching bits and pieces about Olson, until tonight when I read lots of
references to him. Has something happened recently that has provoked all this
discussion? It's odd because a friend of mine recently pulled "Call Me
Ishmael" from my bookshelf and got totally involved in quite a critical way. He
totally rejected the book until the chapter on Shakespeare at which point
he became enthusiastic.
 
I don't really have a second question, rather a comment. I like the
discussion on visual poetry, because that is more or less where I am
coming from. This bulletin board, the way it is now configured, for me at
least, is not what I would call visual. In fact I think it discourages
visual presentation. Nevertheless it is extremely seductive.
 
As far as the top ten go, Kenny , all I can say is music, radio, poetry.
 
What is good about being part of a group of people without a rigid hierarchy
is the spontaneous. The fact that important works of art have been lost
is very disturbing. However, an idea can be passed from one individual to
another. I am enough of an egoist to want people to know who I am, but I
also know that great works of art have been produced anonymously by
groups of people. Not an easy postion to take in an environment that
stresses the individual, but one that might help us into the future.

Next I wonder if anyone knows whatever happened to Gegrory Corso, and
also if anyone knows why his poetry was cut out of the second edition
of the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry. Seems to me he was
rather indifferent to reputation, like some other people I've heard
of. He seemed a kind of comic Whitman to me. I keep him going with
xeroxes.
 
Oh it was good to hear about the Mina Loy revival. And I look forward
to seeing Cendrars made available in English--"Blaise, est-ce que
nous sommes tres loin de Monmartre?" (Song of the Trans-Siberian
Railroad).
 
Would you believe that Mina Loy was one of the poets most admired by
Yvor Winters, at least when he was a young man--when he and Williams
were still on terms of mutual admiration?

In response to several messages and again to Kenny Goldsmith, the Segue
Catalog which was published by Segue from 1981(?) through 1994 was a
curated list of what I and a few others thought was each year's best new
publication and the most important of the past few years. Usually books
stayed on the list only three years, although some books, by their
centrality were kept on longer. I also kept Roof Books on as long as they
were in print. This then represents the list of books that the poets
chose, primarily east coast writers, although the major west coast
writers were polled every year by mail. Some responded regularly and some
didn't. Since I don't remember all the names of the people who
contributed to the list I will not mention names for fear of angering
someone I forget. The list is pretty accurate in terms of how the
material was collected. Over 100 publishers were asked for their list of
books. People who are new to the poetry group would have been on the list
had they been around as late as 1993 and actively going to readings.
Someone like Kenny it has been pointed out might have received 5 or 6
copies. There were generally about 10,000 copies of the list circulated
which made it the widest circulation publication in this poetry circle.
Lists included were the Segue Foundation list, MLA selected lists, and
library lists. When NEA defunded the list I asked people if anyone could
help it to continue, but the $10,000 short fall was too much for anyone
to bear to accommodate my taste and the taste of a few poets who were
willing to donate their curatorial time. So 1994 was the last list.
 
Again, I will send out the compiled list when it's completed.

The _Collected_ was actually just reprinted by University of California

in a couple of bookstores. Selling for something between $15 and $18 (U.S.).

Tony (and everyone else):
 
The Collected O'Hara is in fact just now back in print, in paper from the
University of California Press. Got mine in the mail just 2-3 days ago. As a
consultant on the project, I suggested that they try to price the book to make
it competitive with the Random House (I think) Selected, hoping that for a
couple of bucks more teachers, for instance, would be willing to order the
Collected over the Selected for classes. So please consider that possibility
if you're in the business of teaching O'Hara. And all interested parties who
are not will hopefully want to have the book anyway . . .

Dear Colleen, Tony Green & inbetween,
     Tony: okay, I won't hold out on you. Was very glad, Colleen, you
posted about _Malleable Cast_--you're absolutely right that this's to be
taken in thru the gut as well as the head. And what you say about the two
blindfolded women in profile sounds absolutely right. (Note how the word
"SHE" falls right there, on the taller woman's blindfold.)
     & Colleen, what you say about _Malleable Cast_ being read as a
narrative sounds absolutely right, too. The book is, after all, squarish,
one visual per page, sort of like a storyboard, or successive film stills.
I wonder, though, about what's gained (vs. what's lost) reading the book
from cover to cover, without considering other options. You're right; the
two images opening & closing the book are closely related. But, note that
the woman pushing the boy up the ladder (first image) is pushing him *out*
of the book (to the left, against English-language reading, which goes
from left to *right*). (& that's not something I thought about so much,
but felt, in my gut.) Since Spencer's doing these things on
transparencies, I'd imagine if he wanted to, he could easily have reversed
this image so the boy was being pushed *into* the book, not out of it.
(*That's* something I thought about.)
     Also, consider the title: _Malleable Cast_. Cast as in "cast of
characters" (so narrative's right on here) or in the sense of something
being cast (a line, as in "fishing"--what both you & I are doing writing
about the work, as well as how Spencer put it together, physically) or,
finally, in the sense of a cast, like a mould. But, it's "malleable"--thus
working against the idea of characters in the workshop sense (w/traits
that *determine* character), and also against a linear reading--from cover
to cover--of this book. Sure, this (these images, in this order) is how
it's been cast, but the impulse (suggested by "malleable" in the title)
seems to be suggesting that the reader might work against that. Myself,
first I read this book from the center out, as the images on both ends
seem "exits" of a sort. But, it can be read otherwise, too. (I always
remember Spencer as being the person who introduced me to Chaos theory,
which seems to work against linearity.)
     This is not to suggest that there isn't a narrative element working
here: I think you're right, Colleen; there is. And also, again, your
reading of the epigraphs seem dead on, having much more to do with what's
here than what I'd (first) taken from it.  So, thanks for your splendid
reading.
     Spencer? How come you've been silent through all this? Did you
construct this book as a narrative? As a linear narrative? How do you
feel about our readings--encouraged? Discouraged? These aren't rhetorical
questions, my friend ... this seems a great opportunity to get an
author's response to readings ...
 
     Yours,
 
     Gary

Bill Luoma  (et al)  "  Were there words on Achilles' shield?"
 
The last word on Achilles's shield was Homer's, I believe.
 
Seriously, as a proposal, why not a shield with words on it for
Achilles?   However, the series: words - rebus - image
(or another series words-theatre-image?) allow transition from
word-text to image to become comprehensible.  Perhaps.  Anyone
have any ideas on this?
 
But the Selby book sounds like it's mixed image and text, which makes
the effort to ex-plain in it in order to convince Ron Silliman of it's
value(s) stress the functioning of the image-in-the-text.  Word-text
would be simply reproducible/quotable on e-mail but the particular
appearance of this book is "transmitted"  (translated, betrayed) via
word-text only.  That's why I was fascinated by the resultant
posts of Gary.

Can anyone tell me what Polovtsoi is? Polovoi (with various endings) in
Russian is  in one meaning an adjective - sexual. But I'm not sure of this
at all, particularly with the -tsoi ending. I could be way off the track.

edition of 1500. It's never been republished and Koch chose not to
excerpt from the poem in his Selected Poems in hopes of eventually
having the whole again in print. It's the most spontaneous and surreal
work of Koch's.
 
Poem of the Cid, translated by Paul Blackburn. The goofiest publication
of a major poem during that entire decade and maybe ever this appeared
as a "Study Master Publication" in 1966, a competitor with Cliff Notes.
It's an infinitely better poem in English than the Merwin (as anything
by Blackburn is, even tho I admit that I admire some of Merwin's work.
This was the source for Dorn's Gunslinger epic. 151 pages sans Spanish
in the original.
 
Others that come to mind include John Weiners' Hotel Wently Poems (the
impact of that book, with the Robert LaVigne illustrations, gets lost in
a larger gathering, as does Spicer s Language, for example; my copy of
the Weiners originally belonged to Bill Bathurst during his heavy
recreational pharmaceuticals period, bleary pen doodles everywhere;
Keith Abbott tells me he s cleaned his act up and is now serving as a
consultant to one of the  post-communist  countries in Eastern Europe),
Joanne Kyger s The Tapestry and the Web, Phil Whalen's On Bear's Head
(Norman Fischer is working on this as we speak), Kathleen Fraser's What
I Want, Curtis Faville's Stanzas for an Evening Out, and possibly Tom
Clark's Neil Young. There are some critical texts that also would
warrant rescuing: David Ossman's The Sullen Art, the original
Olson/Creeley Mayan Letters.

Subject:      Re: close reading
 
   An open question--When people read (whether it's "close or not"--you
   decide what to call it), do you (plural) tend to mark up the margins
   alot? Do you sit there with a notebook? Do you find that you write
   more WHILE reading--(I i.e. do you read to write), or do you see these
   as discrete activities more often than not? If you do write in the
   margines alot does that have something to do with whether you like
   long-lined or short-lined poems? Does the kind of poem Spencer Selby
   just posted "turn you on?" By "kind of poem" I mean a certain kind of
   balanced lyric formal diction and tone that is not in much contemporary
   poetry I'm aware of...a refusal of gaudy gimmicks...a poem that "looks
   like a lyric" in a certain old-fashioned sense allegedly of "gem-like"
   White Buildings Crane--or at least the momeory of it, a certain modesty
   that is also authority...Personally I tend not to separate reading and
   writing much...I am interested in a discursive mode of close reading that
   doesn't exist until I do it...I am in academia now and am trying not to
   let that get in the way...or am trying to find a way NOT to let it get
   in the way...The great taboos surround seemingly in force...One could
   say they're only in "the mind."---Chris Stroffolino

     "balancing" between not just between "dead" and "alive" writers...
     but also about what they feel this does to their sense of poetry or

Alan--
 
bravo and kudos (and huzzahs!).  will do, absolutely.
 
I have a couple/few copies of the collected as first published, designed to
be a big book that would look something like the Stevens Collected
apparently.  The cover on the Selected (the Rivers sketch w Frank's prick
prominently displayed) was supposed to be the cover to the original
hardbound and I THINK that there were a very few of those distributed
(rather like a stamp w the flag upside down now....) before Random House
chickened out (all this, baffled by several years [loss of] memory from
David Shapiro); but the bowdlerized version has an absolutely beautiful
photo of Frank on the cover.
 
Did "Berdie" get restored to the index (it was in the table of contents but
not the index in the Collected, and NOT in the Selected--a really beautiful
poem)?  There are a number of other amazing poems not in the Selected, so
this is Good News Indeed!

Subject:      Re: Bedside Books
 
Books I'm either reading or about to that I forgot because I was
scribbling my email at work (avoiding the completion of a white paper on
"What is PC Asset Management?"):
 
Culture on the Brink: Ideologies of Technology, edited by Gretchen
Bender & Timothy Druckrey (Bay Press' DIA series), with pieces by
Stanley Aronowitz, Paula Treichler (Cary Nelson's SO) on AIDS and
Identity, Langdon Winner, Laurie Anderson, Avital Ronell, and Andrew
Ross. Anderson is the only one I didn't actively solicit for work when I
edited Socialist Review. These other folks are all terrific, but I will
be very curious to see if they actually understand what they're talking
about in this terrain. If I had a dime for every bad piece of writing on
technology meets culture, I'd never work again.
 
New Left Review 209 (Jameson on Derrida & Marx, Stuart Hall on Carribean
identity, Geras on Rorty, some other excellent looking pieces [meaning I
haven't read them yet]). Looks like the best issue of NLR in about 5
years.
 
Made to Seem, Rae Armantrout's new book from Sun & Moon. This is
rereading really, since I see most of these poems in manuscript first
(often in ten or twelve different versions with just one word or a line
break altered). Seeing them in a book is always a curious experience for
me since it means that they have now been "pinned down" in a way they
seldom seem to be "in life." Here's my favorite this week:
 
MY PROBLEM
 
It is my responsibility
to squeeze
the present from the past
by demanding particulars.
 
When the dog is used
to represent the inner
man, I need to ask,
"What kind of dog is it?"
 
If a parasitic
metaphor grows all
throughout--good!
Why stop with a barnacle?
 
A honeysuckle,
thrown like an arm,
around a chain-link fence,
would be far more
 
articulated,
more precisely repetitive,
giving me the feeling
that I can go on like this
 
while the woman
at the next table says,
"You smell pretty,"
 
and sends her small daughter's
laugh, a sputtery orgasm,
into my ear--
 
though this may not have been
what you intended.
 
It may not be a problem
when I notice
the way the person shifts.
 
Rae's poems often have the hallucinated clarity of a dream state (maybe
in this case, with the decidedly incestuous undertone of the mother
initiating the daughter's "orgasm," one of the dwarf dreams out of Twin
Peaks). Behind that lucidity the "narrative frame" is often either
unclear or unimportant compared with the rhetoric or structure of the
argument at the surface (a particularly Lacanian view of content I
suppose). I can't tell if the Bromige allusion in the title is intended
or not.
 
There's also a lengthy piece on Armantrout (the first that I'm aware of)
by Jeffrey Peterson in the new Sagetrieb. I continue to be amazed that
Rae hasn't been the "crossover" success of LangPo & G1 generally, but
where some fall back on beauty, humor, or anger posed as satire, Rae
never pulls punches in her work. The largest book to date is a selected
published in France in French. Amazing!

This takes things from the sixties into the seventies and even eighties,
but people on this list should also know that bp Nichol's The Martyrology
has been re-issued by Coach House Press, Toronto (always difficult to
find in this country, but perhaps SPD has them (at times they've had
Nichol's work & Coach House titles, but not consistently, the fault, I
believe, not being theirs, rather Coach House & the difficulty of dealing
with customs, etc.). These works are 9 volumes in, I believe, 6 books.
They are most definitely worth the read, although Nichol's other
collections have a variousness I am often drawn to even more. (Thanks
again, Joel K. & Bill H., for taking me to Toronto recently to see the
concrete poem in the concrete on bpNichol Lane).
 
As to reading, beside my bed are John Cage: Composed in America, ed. M.
Perloff & C. Junkerman (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1994), Robin Blaser's The
Holy Forest (Coach House, 1993), How to Make an Antique (artist's book by
Karen Wirth & Robt. Lawrence (pub. by the artists, 1989), Kevin Magee's
Tedium Drum (lyric &, 1994). I'm carrying around with me Kit Robinson's
Balance Sheet (Roof, 1994) and various books of poems by Emily Dickinson
(I seem to do that periodically). I'm looking at Keith Smith's
Non-Adhesive Binding, which gives fantastic ideas & instruction for real
& possible book structures. And I'm reading Tom Peters's The Pursuit of
Wow, which is very silly, but refreshes me on the need to be creative in
managing & directing an organization and the people who work with me
there. I'm also reading manuscripts by Anne Tardos and
typesetting/designing manuscripts/books by Mary Margaret Sloan and Myung
Mi Kim. A manuscript of sonnets by Tom Mandel is never far away, trying
to figure its best way to become the astonishing book it needs to be.

1.
Anew strain. A new strain with the look of the mainstream.
 
2.
Fragmentation. Is what most do, read a whole text that might challenge
their values, but never be sobered by that, jump, hop, scotch.
 
3.
Language. Making a fashion, shared agenda, purity, is exactly what those who
write "communicative" poetry, with "images" and "feeling" do; and they feel
we exclude them as we they do us - though they hold more money in the market.
 
4.
Camp. Ashbery homage. As if one were Ashbery, imagining a political agenda
for his work that John himself doesn't have; very simple politic "accept gays"
and then lots of in-jokes, and exclusionary tactics for those not in the
polari syntax. "Savour painting more", as well, perhaps.
 
4.
Fragmentation. As indication that one had in fact read and loved the whole
of Dante and Ovid, and one's own poem is a furthering synergy, overhearing
the private and succinct conversation of Dante and Ovid knowing and loving
each other utterly and planning a collaborative project.
 
3.
Originary energy 1978-82. G1, not easy to take the pot calling the kettle
over-boiled when both thin the paint for yet another go at a one-colour
abstract canvas, G2. Re-feel a feeling? A fell, a high hill, re-fuel.
 
2.
Derrida's Cinders. Cannot go back (to 1968-78), the furthering synergy
says something of his carriage makes good pumpkin broth.
 
1.
Fragmentation. One glimpses angel in one lost to routine.

The first line of "Berdie" is in the index, yes. Another poem, "Song of
Ending," starting with "Berdie, berdie" has a particularly Rilkean feel to
it, ending with:
 
...they disappear with one
 
last cry, not echoing, and then
the emptiness is full of light.
 
Berdie, not to be sad and crazy,
all birds hide what the have lost.
 
compared to another ending:
 
...and distant calls of birds , while in the sky
the starry nights of another, sweeter country
blossomed above them and would never close.
 
 
from Rilke's "Tombs of the Hetaerae." In all likelyhood this is just
chance, or a habit of mine of forcing pieces of the puzzle together. It
would be interesting to find out, if anyone knows, O'Hara's feelings toward
Rilke and whether he'd ever been known to carry around a copy of "New
Poems."

   Dear patrick--interesting question--I always had this hunch that
   early Rilke, such as "Tombs" is more like O'Hara, whereas Duino
   Elegies is more like Ashbery. Perloff, I think, links Three Poems
   to Notebooks of...Brigg...and in her book on O'Hara claims some
   Rilke influence on him, but this is a question that could be looked
   into further...Chris

Thanks to Ron, Gary, Colleen, Bill and others for their interest and
thoughts about _Malleable Cast_. I am flattered by this discussion, which
I have hesitated to enter because I believe the work does best on its own
and because I don't believe my ideas about it are more valid than others.
If not for Gary, I would probably leave it at that. But he has persuaded
me to say more, to overcome my hesitation and share a few of my
thoughts about the book.
        Reactions to this work vary quite a bit. Some people think the
writing is too fragmentary, interrupted or concealed, and that the images
predominate. Others are able to derive a lot meaning from the words and
phrases that appear and the way they play off or interact with the images.
I prefer the latter approach, but that does not mean I think there's
anything wrong with the former, or with just treating these pieces as
visual. I believe the words have an effect whether it is consciously
recognized or not. (Providing you can read English, which has not always
been the case, as these pieces have been published in many foreign
countries.)
        As Gary has pointed out, the title can be a very good place to
start. Malleable cast metal and a malleable cast of characters are primary
for me. The malleable cast of characters is what is presented in this
work. Malleable cast metal evokes a process that is both industrial and
that reaches back before modern industry. It evokes a process of fusion
thru heat, which is both metaphorical and one of the foundations of modern
society.
        The idea of fusion underpins the entire book and the many linkages
that are made or attempted. Central among these are science, alchemy and
the quotidian. Searching, building and striving are balanced against
disease, blindness and the static normality of American life, which is
graphically (and humorously) portrayed by these images from the 30's, 40's
and 50's. Many of the images contain their own antithesis, as when this
normality appears more bizarre than anything else. Strange juxtapositions
abound which link past with present, and which link the social threads
with the more immediate issues that center on the nature of this work as
art that fuses image and word. This fusing is a kind of alchemy in which
the characters and pieces are definitely malleable. The malleable cast
that has a historical foundation is thus integrally related to the
malleability of the works themselves. The work is both private and public,
mirrorlike and a kind of social biography. Word and image interrogate the
relationship between word and world. And that again involves questions
about the reader or viewer's relationship with the art or medium which
makes the interrogation possible.
        All of these questions are open-ended, but they also have answers
which are embedded in the work. The reader/viewer may pick up a shovel and
acknowledge identification with the miner on the cover of the book. In
doing that she should be able to tap into more of the ore and treasures
that this world/work may offer.
        Spencer Selby
        P.S. I did not construct the work as a narrative, at least not at
first. The sequence was determined for the book, which was a year after
the pieces were completed. There may be some narrative idea behind the
sequence. It seems to me a valid way of approaching the work, though not at
all necessary.

Well, even if we could find out that there were words on Achilles's
shield, I am pretty sure that we would find out that they were
foreign words, so what would be the use?
Or maybe we would find out that he used words AS shields, the way so

Silliman had some beauties on his list.
 
Is Michael Rumaker's _The Butterfly_ out of print again? My, that was
a nice piece of prose at the time. It was so much UNlike what you
were reading in your U.S. Lit course.

this is prolly like the blind trying to lead the one-eyed (pardon my
ablism) but in my scrawled notes on "A Step Away from Them" (in the
margins I mean) some made recently but this one made in David Shapiro's
amazing seminar about twenty years ago now, I have, laeding out from the
beautiful "where the sign / blows smoke over my head, and higher / the
waterfall pours lightly," this: "cf. Rilke, /Duino Elegies,/: "And
higher, the news atars in the land of pain."  The problem is that David,
too, heard echoes everywhere, so who knows?  Like Douglas (in this
respect though not in many others) he's presumably not on email.
As presumably not, too, is Kenneth, who just came up again via Ron
Silliman.  Apparently there's still time to send on birthday greetings
for the 70th birthday celebration mentioned by Marisa Januzzi on this
list a couple weeks ago--in c/o her, perhaps, being one possible route.

Yes, it's true that anyone who wants to convey birthday messages to be
read at KK's birthday celebration can e-mail them to me at
<jma5@columbia.edu>.  We're asking that the messages not take more than 3
minutes to read.  If anyone plans to be in NYC, the time and place are:
7PM Thursday March 23, Maison Francaise, Columbia University, 116th and
Broadway.  For more specific info or directions, of course feel free to
contact me.  Ron Padgett will coordinate various readers and readings and
theatricals and confessions and home movies, and we will have cheese.
 
Gass gave a reading with Gaddis at the 92Street Y a few weeks ago; don't
know if that counts as fanfare for his new book, but it was a good
reading with Gaddis acting very grumpy about the whole thing.  If anyone
gets through the entire TUNNEL I would be very curious to hear about the
cumulative effect.

H.T. Kirby-Smith mentioned poetry in the 1500s that tried to
accomodate appearance on the page to content. Now, I have a lot of
trouble with that concept--the idea of poetry's containing something.
I know that it is a term long in use, but ever since I first heard it
I have wanted to have it explained to me. What is the "content" of a
poem. How can a poem be a container? Isnt it words that dissapewar as
sound into the air and down people's earholes? As written how will it
contain. What would be an example of something contained in a
poem-container? I am not fooling here.

friends--
 
response to yesterday's call for reviewers has been quick & generous;
many thanks to all.  mindful of past discussions (and past issues of
TRR), i notice that all offers so far have been from men.  before
i give the boys first pick, i'd like to enter a plea to women on
the list to consider contributing...  as mentioned, in addition to
titles listed in the post, current poetry/lit/language/intermedia
releases from any small independent presses would be welcome (tho
best to check first, in order to avoid duplication).  the aim of
TRR is to help connect readers to a variety of new work--a variety
of perspectives is essential in reaching that goal.
 
&, tho i'd _not_ want to see exclusively gender-correlated reviewers,
i'll point out that almost half of the authors on the initial list
are women.
 
again, _many_ thanks to the folks who've offered so far--i'm sure
you'll understand this as no slight...
 
sincere

in your reading list you mention lew ellingham's book on
jack spicer.  I am currently writing on spicer (or, at least
on the cusp of writing) and am interested in hearing what
you have to say about ellingham's book.  I think I have
read more anecdotes than insights on spicer.

ryan: there are 2 versions of ellingham's ms --one a rich and lively (though
over-long and unfocused) set of oral histories centered on spicer but addressing
the entire gay/beat/bohemian/poetic scene of north beach in the 50s and 60s in
much particularity --lots of thumbnail portraits of folks like russell
fitzgerald (whose beautiful journals are copiously quoted), bob kaufman (on whom
fitzgerald had a mad crush), paul alexander, joanne kyger, etc.  the other
version is a biographical distillation of the longer ms.--i'm only on p 100 or
so of that one.  what this version gains in brevity and focus it loses in
intensity; there are fewer readings of poems (spicer's and other's) and less
in-depth discussion of poetics.  what u say about the rich anecdotal lore on
spicer outweighing the serious consideration of his poetics is interesting; i
think this often happens with "cult figures"; one way of looking at this is to
grant that analysis might be embedded in these anecdotes and could be teased out
--that these anecdotes are part of the poetics relevant to whatever poet seems
to end up being talked about this way.  because the layering of legend around a
"poet" and his "poems" becomes part of the context that determines the meaning
and substance of his/her oeuvre, just as clifford geertz's "thick description"
is part of the ethnography the anthropologist generates. what "cultural work" is
accomplished by these anecdotes and the need to tell them?  whaddya
think?--maria

dear Tony Green --
 
your question about poetry is addressed to Chris S., but i
couldn't let it go.  there is, anyway here where i am a
dissertator & instructor, zero encouragement to do anything
other than these 2 things.  & i sense, often, that people who
write poetry while they are pursuing academics are seen as
double-dippers, can't quite make up their minds, poor things,
& after all the creative act can have a kind of dulling,
happifying effect on them, when they ought to know it's best to
use all one's mental energy to think sharply & clearly, to
reach objectivisms of the mind, to EXPLAIN without sievey
effect certain small truths about certain pre-written arenas.
 
pardon the tone, perhaps.  but i think i found your question
remarkable, & i wonder if there is not this division in NZ?
let me add: as academic expands it seems there are some people
& places where this conflict is not so evident -- i felt this
at the Louisville conference -- & that change makes me more
content to be, as it were, institutionalized.
        & so i continue to write poetry, too.

Dear Lisa,
         NZ has much the same noxious divisions as pretty well anywhere else
in English speaking academia -- of the kind you write about.  I'm
interested in resistances, cross-overs, infiltration strategies.
Hence my  question on this list ( to Chris and anyone else).  Charles
Bernstein's A Poetics is a point of resistance for me.
         Looking for professional philosophers to back up an idea I
had about Descartes's narrative of doubt and certainty, I found, on
Friday, Dalia Judovitz "Subjectivity and Representation in Descartes"
 C.U.P.1988 (writing that goes back to early 1980's) , proposing to
cross  frontiers, with: " ...the foundation of subjectivity as a
philosophical construct is inseparable from its literary
representation as an autobiographical, historical and narrative
entity".  Sounds promising (intro.p.3)   Who made the division (and
when) between literary and philosophical?  The questions get to beg
for Foucaultian answers pretty fast.
 
Best wishes

measure" is something I feel first in my gut then, later, spend hours on
the phone with friends, "verifying."  I'll describe the book, after which
point I'll ask, "So, is this groovy, or what?" A "yes" answer from more
than 1/2 of all queried friends "verifies" grooviness. Level of
queried-friend enthusiasm determines Groove Factor. A "no" answer from
more than 1/2 can either (a) lower Groove Factor, or (b) annul said book's
"groovy" status. (Book becomes "just-a-book.") No, the work
doesn't *necessarily* have to be any good. But, it helps. Lastly,
"groovy," like "campy," is a value attributed more by audience
member, than maker. Most "fine print" editions--lovely though they
might be--are not "groovy." (It's a distinction that admittedly still
needs work.) (Chris Stroffolino, as someone in academia who's also
interested in contemporary rock music, you might be the perfect person
to--perhaps as a thesis?--hammer out the above admittedly "foggy notion"s
of "grooviness" into a "sharp" essay.)
     So, in no particular order, here are 10 randomly chosen "groovy"
books ...
     Alfred Tennyson, _Lover's Tale_, Walton Press, no copyright date.
This hardcover (library binding?) of Tennyson's poem includes three
"found" photos by Bern Porter. I gave this book 1 Groove Unit for each
photo. Three photos x 1 Groove Unit ea. = GROOVE FACTOR 3.
     Chris Mason, _Click Poems_, Shabby Editions, 1982. "The Click Poems
were inspired by and are dedicated to the click language of the Bushmen in
South Africa, and the Ameslan sign language of the deaf community of the
United States." A beautiful mini-chap w/extraordinary work (can't
reproduce here; poems use "fermatas", illustrations of lips &etc.,
scribbled out text) found used in MPLS. GROOVE FACTOR: 5. Hey, wait! The
address says "c/o Cris Cheek"! And Cris is on this list! I've "talked to"
Cris! GROOVE FACTOR: 7.
     Jack Spicer, _After Lorca_, (picture of cone = press name?), 1974. A
reprint (pirated?). Blue ink. The verso of the title page says: "This book
has been typed on an IBM Selectric blah, blah, blah, by Robin Cones and
printed by Marco Polio for the Government, with a cover from a photo by
blah, blah, blah, in March, 1974." Anyone know who made this book?
Delicious! GROOVE FACTOR: 10.
     Patti Smith, _Seventh Heaven_, Telegraph Books, 1972.  Patti's first
book, I think. GREAT cover photo: looks like Patti hasn't bathed since
1966, struggling to keep eyes open.  Dedication: "this book is dedicated
to/ Mickey Spillane/ and/ Anita Pallenberg." How groovy? GROOVE FACTOR 8.
     James Sherry, _In Case_, Sun & Moon Press, 1981. Great lurid pulp
cover, text pages printed on *pulp stock paper*. Jonathan Brannen (a
frequent Groove Consultant) mentioned that he'd seen a review of this book
that actually *criticized* the book for having been printed on such
"cheap" paper. (Critic obviously didn't "get" it.) GROOVE FACTOR
(including Brannen's anecdote):  6.
     Maxine Chernoff, _A Vegetable Emergency_, Beyond Baroque Foundation,
1977. This 8-1/2" x 11" printed on cheap stock was published in an edition
of EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED copies.  *Tell* me that's not groovy. Bonus
Groove Unit as I got it signed by Chernoff in '93, who explained the high
press run: "Yeah, they, um, they printed an awful lot of these." GROOVE
FACTOR: 6.
     James Haining (editor), _Salt Lick_ Vol. 2, Nos. 1-2, 1972.  Every
issue of _Salt Lick_ is groovy, but this one particularly so. Includes
Gerald Burns' _Boccherini's Minuet_ as a make-it- yourself chapbook insert
(!); also includes poems by Robert Slater, Robert Trammell's "George
Washington Trammell," poems by Ann Darr, Stephen Leggett, Bruce Andrews'
"Getting Ready To Be Frightened" ("go Gandhi go"), poems by James Haining,
drawings by Wilton David, and essays & reviews by Burns, Michael Lally, Al
Drake, Andrews, Victor Contoski, Darr, Ron Silliman, Daniel Castelaz, and
Haining. Reading this, you get the sense that, in 1972, anything might've
happened. Incredible list of Books & Mags received. GROOVE FACTOR: 10.
     J H Prynne, _Kitchen Poems_, Grossman/Cape Goliard, 1968.  Top o' the
line poetry, *beautiful* edition (great two-page "trig" drawing in red on
title & facing pages). GROOVE FACTOR 9.  (Docked one point from perfect
score only because I found two copies in the same used bookstore.) (Groove
"aura" loss.)
     Robert Gluck, _Marsha Poems_, Hoddypoll Press, 1973. Instead of
stapling this 8-1/2" x 11", the publisher bound it with red string. Also,
"Marsha"--the cartoon woman on the cover--has red flowers felt-tip penned
onto her dress. GROOVE FACTOR: 5.
     Tom Weatherly, _Maumau American Cantos_, Corinth Books, 1970. The
title? *Way* "seventies." Includes subtitles like: "roi rogers and the
warlocks of space." You know what I'm thinkin'?  I'm thinkin': GROOVE
FACTOR 8.
     That's ten. Groovy.
     Yours,
     Gary

Hi Gary.  You did not mention that you, yourself, Gary Sullivan, have a
"groove factor" of about 11 or 12.
 
And even those numbers are too pubescent to describe the full engorged groove
factor you walk amidst, like an angel in a cloud.
 
Thanks--for being you.

maria--in response to your response re spicer and that "the layering
of legend around a 'poet' and his 'poems' becomes part of the context
that determines meaning".
 
Thanks for your thoughts on both versions of Ellingham's book.
As for your ideas on anecdotes, it raises an interesting problem.
It seems to me, in the reading I have done around Spicer, that
anecdotes are the preferred critical point of departure because
there isn't really an easily and accessible language to discuss
his work with/within.  I'm thinking of Blaser's essay at the
end of the collected works as perhaps the closest example of
writing which comes as close as it can to Spicer's writing
against the poem as "container" (to quote another e-list topic).
It seems to me that because much of his poetry occurs in dis-
ruption, in the space between form/referent, original/translation,
world/poem (Lorca's lemons, for instance or the necessity of
resonance in the serial poem), a stable, critical discourse is
the wrong bone to pick with.
Or, maybe not.  Any thoughts?

   Dear Tony and Lisa--I guess it's a question of "finding a niche" or
   questioning what is allegedly considered "marketable" out there--I
   may be "naively" "deluding" myself--but I wonder about what is considered
   "fashionable" in academia today and how many people (whether as poets or
   not) seem to be cowering under these dimly perceived "demands of the
   marketplace"--As a student, I have no answers but hunches at present
   about such "ways and means" and 'strategies of subversions"--However,
   the division between "philosophy and literature" I do not see as a
   problem Foucault has answered--in fact, Foucauldianisn may be part of
   the problem itself (not that there isn't "value" in Foucault)...the
   question in some ways is perennial--depsite the generational specificity
   one could appeal to in terms of academic and economic realities...
   This is probably too vague... but, for the most part, unlike Lisa, I
   have suspended my so-called "poetic" activities in my first year here
   as a graduate student...(though that my change)...Chris S.

Hi  Chris,
      The question is not quite so easy:      If your practice with
texts is margin writing, how far does that notion of writing figure in what you
do elsewise in the setting of the academy?     Is this a fair
statement of a position that some people might hold:  "Much of what I am
interested in  doing as a writer would fit better with
some rather different academy than the one I'm actually in --- but I
persist.  This brings with it some conflict, but in the long term
this produces pressure on the academy to change."  (Wystan Curnow said
something like this in a post a few months ago in a discussion of the
academy.  It can harbour difference, sometimes.)  In the end, the
academy cannot do without a renewal of productive activity.
 
The funny thing about the Descartes book by Judowitz is that so far I
can't see it taking advantage of the possibilities of narrative or autobiographical or
fictional strategies itself: it remains expository discourse of a
familiar enough kind.
 
But Susan Howe's writing on Emily Dickinson, that's a model that not
too many academic readers will happily endorse, and recommend to
their students as models....?... (I hope I'm wrong on that).
 
So Foucault, and what ever else by way of theory, may show where the
problem lies, but  doesn't necessaril;y
change anything in practice.

P.S. I've misread you, Chris.  Foucault is part of the problem?  Oh,
I was thinking of the Archaeology of Knowledge and the analysis of
the how writing is controlled and authorised by institutional
set-ups.  So I was seeing the problems of writing in the academy
in terms of what is permitted and what is not by the institution.
 
I also think now of the evident difficulties that occurred when
Charles Olson delivered his Beloit lectures (No theme sentences!) or
the account of the last days of Olson by Charles Boer.  Olsonian
practice looks as remote from academic respectability as
ever...raising the question, just how  "serious" is he as a
historian?....(How many writers on history or mythology cite his
views as support?.....)

I do like Lisa's comparison between the demand to think clearly and
objectively (a la science perhaps? or a la someone's misconception of
science?) and the fuzzy poor thing double dippers who write--what, for
enjoyment?  I have hardly written a poetic or fictional word since I came
to begin this Fddd.  Am finally doing so again because taking a class on
surrealism where the prof actually believes in writing like to learn
about.  But sometimes I feel as though I'm having my bones pared down in
an effort to get me to think in a way that don't come naturally.

   Dear Tony, Lisa, Gabrielle, etc.--
   When Tony writes "If your practice with texts is margin writing..."
   I wonder IF my practice with texts IS margin writing, and I distrust
   what i will call my own tendency to introject and/or employ such
   academic/professional buzzwords...and I'd like to think thatin academia
   the "use" of such terms does not automatically imply a too eager attitude
   towards "marketability"--etc. I don't think it's just true at my school,
    (though i may be overgeneralizing--especially in this age of Newt gingrich
    and Allan Bloom), that there is a lot of discourse that announces itself
    as "margin writing" because it is fashionable to do so...Whether this
    really is margin writing of course is a more interesting question because
    it allows one to see the OLD IN THE NEW and the NEW IN THE OLD...This does
   not mean that I do not wish my dissertation to "explode academic discourse"
   as much as MY EMILY DICKINSON does...But I do not want to be self-congratula
   tory about how "unigue" and "new" and "progressive" either "I" or "my people"   are--I guess I see such posturing as "getting in the way of the real issues"
   (as James Sherry read me months ago), and by "real issues" I just mean the
   possibility of COMMUNICATION of a more intimate sort occuring in institutional  contexts....though I also think what is central here is that there is a
   need to be challenged intellectually as well...It is not a mere question of
   "new" and "old" or "margin writing" but of a desire to learn as well as
    teach and to actually not be one of those who, burdened by professionalism
    or scarred by academia, can not be fueled or excited by their involvement
    with it. As if one can play a role one hates in hopes it will catch the
    ear without killing it...and only then FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO BE
    ITSELF (if it knows what it likes anymore---and no I'm not necessarily
    "privileging" "humanist essentialism" here)....For there is not only
    McPoetry but McAcademic Discourse it seems to me, and it wants to have
    the house surrounded, blaring Eddie Cochran's "get to the top I'm too
    tired to rock," of which this impatience of mine to "correct" myself
    in public is no doubt part (but smile). Chris

Subject:      New Lally Reprint
 
Since the publisher's not on line, I hope you all won't mind my plugging
this new reprint of:
 
     CATCH MY BREATH, Fiction/Poetry/Autobiography from 1960 -1974
     by MICHAEL LALLY
     Salt Lick Press; 86 pages; perfectbound; $13.00
     Order direct from Salt Lick Press (add $2.00 shipping)
     2107 NE Multnomah Street * Portland, OR 97232-2119 * U.S.A.
     (502) 288-6952
 
     Originally published in 1978, the first edition of this selection of
Lally's early writing went out of print in three months, and has remained
o.p. until this 1995 reprint. Lally is the author of two dozen books, and
edited the anthology _None of the Above_ in 1976, which included work by
Bruce Andrews, Alice Notley & Ron Silliman, among others. He may or may
not have been the editor of O Press (my copy of Blaise Cendrars' _At the
Heart of the World_ ((GROOVE FACTOR: 7)), trans. by Annabel Levitt &
published by O Press in 1978, lists its address as "c/o Michael Lally").
(Anyone who knows who *did* edit O Press -- not to be confused with
Leslie's O Books -- let me know.) (BTW: Rae, is that Harryman O Books book
new? Can you tell us more about it?)
 
     BLURB-TYPE MATTER: "Lally's 'autobiographical' work is not
confessional -- no catharsis, either on his part or the reader's is called
for. Less obvious is the structural function of Lally's continual
insistence on anchoring himself (chronologically, geographically,
politically, sexually): being up-front about his perspective and his
prejudices. ... Lally, the narrator, does not transcribe 'raw material'
but formally organizes a written story as if it were a spoken one -- with
all the personal digressions and asides this implies. ... Lally aims for
separation, judgment, the division of reader's intelligence from his own,
the active direction of it to his work. It is what his 'anchoring' is all
about: here I am, there you are, we are not the same ..." -- Jane DeLynn,
from the Afterword.
 
     EXCERPT (from "Empty Closets"):
 
     No more annexing the gris-gris. Me they generally call
     THE SHELF. They call him DRY the way your balls feel
     when you been put away AGAIN. She forgives the future
     when we take out each others eyes
     to fill in the blanks. Blue gorges.
 
     "Way uptown on a hundred, hanging from my action back, you're
     supposed to watch tv."
 
     Once a year the sharks would come to
     singular execution of snow fields,
     o, in piles behind the early fifties.
     On top of that we move around,
     gored silver following ourselves. Getting fucked.
 
     Now, obviously, if you could get the *original* edition of this book,
that would be *way* groovy. The reprint isn't what I'd call "groovy," but
is a wonderful book nontheless.
     Kevin, thank you so much for that thoroughly flattering groove
assessment, but the research I've done puts me (a mere "groovetaster")
way, way below a Lifetime Achievement Groovemaster like Lally. Did you see
him last week on "NYPD Blue"? Most poets, you give them a bit part in some
TV cop show, they fuck it up. (I think history has proven *that* much.)
When Marta & I watched Lally's "NYPD Blue" performance, we had stacked up
all of his books on the floor, "just in case" he started to get
"embarassing," in which case we'd've been forced to read one of his poems
over the realer-than-life TV dialog. That never happened. He's not only a
wonderful poet, but a stunning TV-cop-show-bit-part-actor, to boot.  What
am I saying? GROOVE FACTOR: 50.
     Yours,
     Gary

Forget  the  politicians' handshakes, PIG PRESS has just published two
of the most exciting of the younger Irish poets:
 
CATHERINE WALSH : PITCH
 
"The  writer  might  be  a  stone  cast  into cast into life recording
narrative ripples and disturbed reflections of  a  zoetrope  memory...
PITCH  is  worth reading, not least to watch thought select which part
of itself to display in language." Tom Raworth
 
48pp / Five Pounds Ninetyfive / Twelve Dollars Ninety
 
MAURICE SCULLY : THE BASIC COLOURS
 
Writing  with  what one critic has called a "lightfooted rage", Scully
chronicles the language shifts of wanderings in  Dublin,  Lesotho  and
Ennis.  Peter  Quartermain  writes: "Who but the pained alert could be
nightwatchman in these ruins of the future where we dwell?"

Also new:
ROY FISHER : IT FOLLOWS THAT
20pp / Two Pounds Ninety / Six Dollars

Dear Gary,
 
   Carla's book, Memory Play, is recent but not brand-new. Copyright 1994.
It's a real play which has been performed several times. It's from Leslie
Scalapino's O books in Berkeley. I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.
Sometimes it seems books just fall into oblivion. As someone with a book just

A slightly more English list of what's balanced (sometimes toppling) from
an upturned and suprisingly robust cardboard box by the bed. I sometimes go
to bed in the afternoon so this isn't always night-time reading or
pre-sleep induction. Also just becasue they're there doesn't mean they'll
all get read soon. Some are started, some up for occasional visits and some
hot. The piles change over about a six weekly cycle.
 
Iain Sinclair  -  Radon Daughters
Roger Griffin  -  The Nature of Fascism
Kathy Acker  -  My Mother: demonology, a novel
Jon Rose  -  Violin Music in the age of SHOPPING
Eric Mottram  -  Double Your Stake
Tom Leonard  -  Reports from the Present
Homi Bhabha  -  The Location of Culture
William Burroughs  -  The Letters of 1945 to 1959
Bernadette Mayer  -  Midwinter Day
Allen Fisher  -  Breadboard
Alan Bullock  -  Hitler and Stalin, parallel lives
Art & Design Magazine  -  'Performance Art Into the 90s'
Macintosh Hypercard User's Guide
 
this list posting is obviously a trend disguising a stronger fascination
with who's reading what. It seems to be an intriguing way of finding out
what's just out and coming up? To echo Eric Pape's point about information
-  little comes this way. Almost only one bookshop stocks any recent U.S.
editions and those by only a handful of 'names'.
As a small publisher here I'm beginning to sort out swaps through this
list. Seems like one useful way forwards. I increasingly value the
inter-continental aspects of this list.
Ancillary question would be, who aprt from SPD might be worth approaching
for distribution Stateside of recent English Poets? Any ideas / interest?

Subject:      Re: poetry v the sharp mind
 
Having hung around academe for many years without managing to buckle down to
much "real" scholarship, I feel I have something to contribute to this thread.
 
(Any excuse not to work on the dissertation . . . )
 
Lisa Samuels well describes academic culture's supercilious attitude toward the
artist-as-academic.  Here at U-Buffalo things are supposed to be different: it
was a great place to be a writer-professor 10 or 20 yrs ago.  Nowadays, though,
the tide turns toward a button-down hyperprofessionalism that increasingly
regards poetry as perhaps an interesting object of analysis but not as a strong
way of thinking in its own right.  I don't see Creeley getting the respect he
deserves, for example; it would be most interesting to hear from CB (no, not
Clive Barnes) and Susan Howe on this topic.
 
Chris Stroffolino is right, too, to say that Foucauldianism (tho 'haps not
Foucault himself, precisely) contributes as much as anything else does to the
hostile atmosphere around here.  Its undeniably powerful critique seems to
delude some followers into regarding themselves as above reproach--as
revolutionarily pure (oddly, since the theory would tend to indicate
otherwise).  I call 'em the "without sin" crowd (and then I duck and cover
because they throw hard.)
 
But, though there are too many of those people about, they are not the main
causes of the problem under discussion.  I trace it to, not a misunderstanding,
but a misapplication of scientific method.  Science gets a great part of its
explanatory power from its insistence upon tackling nature one well-formed
question at a time.  Poetry doesn't and shouldn't work this way.  Art in
general (yes, there is such a thing) deals with knots of inseparable
questions.  Tease these all the way apart and you get much less than you start
with.  Academic disciplines could cope with this, but in the main they do not.
That is why academic disciplines understand a lot about nature in terms of
necessity, in terms of power--but they do not understand human freedom at all
well.
 
(One small tragedy in this mess is that gradstudents' worries about conforming
to theoretical fashion for the sake of marketability are probably misconceived.
Here, for instance, faculty often laments the fact that we don't have enough
young faculty in the supposedly hot new areas, and so gradstudes are deprived
of accreditation in the more marketable perspectives.  Trouble is, what's hot
changes too fast for us to effectively anticipate it. "Ohmygod we have nobody
in Queer Theory!"  Well, guess how many noteworthy publications there have been
"in" Queer Theory in the past few years: like Stein's Oakland, there's not much
of a there there either.)
 
An adage from the sixties: the only way out is through.  Let me suggest some
texts that might be useful as ways to fight back--to critique the academic
folkways that oppress us:
 
Charles Bernstein, "What's Art Got to Do With It . . ." , etc.
 
John Dewey, _Art as Experience_
 
Larry Hickman, _John Dewey's Pragmatic Technology_
 
Ronald deSouza, _The Rationality of Emotion_
 
Mark Johnson, _The Body in the Mind_ (for the basic idea, not the interminable
                                        Kant-quibbling)
 
Peter Sloterdijk, _Critique of Cynical Reason_
 
Bruno Latour, _We Have Never Been Modern_
 
Jacques Derrida, _Specters of Marx_
 
. . . many of whom, of copurse, contradict one another completerly . . .
 
(Sorry these are all boys. I wish I had a good explanation for that. I'd add
Donna Haraway to this list except I have some fundamental objections I'm still
trying to work through.  I doubt it's accidental that my favorite women writers
are all poets!)

the question is :
 
are there any bookstore's informally (if not officially) "on line"
(whether here on this list or in general?)
 
a friend at Powell's in Portland Ore. told me that they spent a million
dollars on the software to go "online" in order to do mail-order book
sales.
 
perhaps we should tell Steve Dickison at SPD to pick up the phone as it
were (perhaps he is here listening, even)
 
a million dollars.
 
then he said they spent 20,000 at one little bay area warehouse called
serendipity and that they were buying up whole bookstores in north amercia
only recently rejecting an offer to move into Prague...
 
so what, we little xroxers are supposed to submit that that ordering
structure to make it "easier"
 
suddenly I wonder if that's the point

George inquired about the availability of "The Tunnel". The beast has
arrived from Knopf, weighing in at 652 pages. It's full of visuals, both
typographical and color maps and "doodles." It lists @ 30 bucks and got a
front page NY Times Book Review article a few weeks ago. I cracked it for
the first time this weekend and it looks good--although it's weird to
think that the opening pages were written thirty years ago...
 
If anyone else has checked this monster out, I'd be interested in yr

I utterly concur with Rae Armantrout that Carla Harryman's Memory Play is
very good writing; a lot like Lorca, with reservations. It was a limited
edition, though, or so Carla told me when she sent me a copy. I'd love
to chat it over, if others have read it. Or with you, Rae, if you've time;
for example "memory" of what? Of genre, I think, and thus very interesting
as combatting expectations of readers of language writing, taking on the
reader...

Dear Jim,
 
RIFFLING THRU SLOTERDIJK BACKWARDS
    "Sapere aude!remains the motto
of an enlightenment that, even in the twilight
of the most recent dangers, resists
   intimidation by catastrophe.   Only out of its courage
can a future still unfold that would be more than the expanded
 
reproduction of the worst of the past.   Such courage
     nourishes itself from the now faint currents of
recollection of a spontaneous ability of life to be-in-order,
         an order not constructed by anybody....."   Sloterdijk,
Critique,p.546
 
"Art is the real Gay Science:  It stands, as the last guarantor of
     a sovereign and realistic consciousness, between religion and
        science."   Ibid. p.179
 
                                        "Politics is not only the art of the
possible, as has been siad, but
 just as muich the art of seduction.  It is the chocolate side of
    power that assumes first, that order must
      prevail and, second, that
the world wants to be deceived."   Ibid. p.147
 
Questions:    Do "education" and "culture"  go their present way because
the principle is in force, that only learning that leads to
immediate cash benefits is to be emcouraged?   Is that why
"poetry" (or any of the arts asking for funding by The State)
are likely to  get trashed at all levels?

Dear friends -
 
Normally I would try for a more graceful and natural English, but this
time I was trying to keep the structure and rhythm of the original,
as far as possible, as it reflects, in Spanish, the way Mayan
people would express their thoughts in their own languages.
If I knew any of the Mayan tongues I could have done a better job,
but since I haven't seen any Maya linguists volunteering, I went ahead.

Zapatista National Liberation Army               Mexico, March 12 1995
 
To the people of Mexico:
 
To the peoples of the world:
 
Brothers:
 
With old pain and new death, our heart speaks to you so that your hearts
listen.  Our pain was in being, hurting it was.  Becoming silent, our
voice was passing away.  Our voice had been of peace, but not of yesterday,
not of old peace that was death.  Of peace was our voice, of tomorrow's
peace. The fire had stayed behind, kept in the days gone by, the fire that
spoke for our race when all were deaf to death.  Another way our tears asked
for, still lost in the arroyos of the mountains. So spoke our dead.  The
oldest ones then counseled us to look where the sun walks, to ask other
brothers of the race, of blood and hope, where our hurt pain should walk, our
tired step. This we did, brothers.  The silence arrived to put out the fire
and there was no arrogance in the word of the true men and women for those
who, in other lands and other races, shared the pain and wishes for a
tomorrow.
 
We opened our heart, brothers. We learned to see and to listen to other,
different brothers. We listened to their word and saw in their heart.
And we saw in their step the same longing that put the fire in our hands,
that broke up our face until it was nothing but a gaze, that hid our
name and erased our past: the struggle to command, obeying; to leave free,
the free word and heart; to give and receive what is deserved.  The struggle
for democracy, freedom and justice.  No more, never less.
 
The word of these brothers, your word, asked us to try another path,
to leave pending and waiting the fire that armed the breast.  To talk, and
that through the words, would come the destination.  It was they, you, the
others. Like us, the always forgotten.  The always humiliated, like us.  The
brothers.  This we did.  Our voice spoke with the powerful lord.  Obeying,
we sent our word to the great house of money.  We spoke and we listened.
We were following that path when the treason, again, put arms above words.
Our voice was silenced all at once by the noise of the cars of war.  Terror
was unleashed again in the Mexican lands.  He who from arrogance and power
looks at us with contempt, denied our name and gave death as a response
to our thought.
 
It wasn't enough for him to deny us a face and life, he wanted to humble
our step of dignity, trample our just demands, take truth from our song,
sink our flag in oblivion.  With the complicity of the big monies and the
foreign vocation, he wanted to impose humiliating conditions on us, just to
speak. Turning backward the wheel of history, he wanted to force us, by the
power of his bayonets, to deny our history.  Our women suffered the
harassment and the humiliation of the machines of war.  Our children grew
with bitterness and impotence between their hands.  Some, the ones who didn't
die.  In the men hate sharpened the breast.  The greatest grandparents looked
again to the earth and asked counsel of the first dead.  They spoke.  The
dead of forever. We.  They said this: "Our hand did not rise armed to listen,
kneeling, to insults and humiliations. Our step did not rise so that he who
is double in his face and in his word could humiliate us, filling hope with
lies.
 
"For justice our hand was armed and our step raised.  And justice is only a
false promise that the powerful dresses himself with.
 
"For freedom our hand was armed and our step raised.  And freedom is sold
for a fistful of coins to the foreign skin.
 
"For democracy our hand was armed and our step raised.  And democracy is
still absent by the work of he who cynicism, crime and lies carried
into government.
 
"Everything, brothers, but dignity trampled again.
 
"Everything, brothers, but lies again on our table.
 
"Everything, brothers, but to forget once again tomorrow.
 
Thus they spoke.  This our dead said.  The war came.  Then again we saw the
brother come in other clothing.  He came to kill.  To die.  Our hand did not
want to again confront he who was sent to kill and to die among the same. For
that reason, our past ones went to the mountains; to the caves of those
before, we went.  Death cornered us and pursued lives that always passed away
obscurely, shades of death and of the shadow of a forgetful country.  Death
came to wield again its knife-edge of oblivion.  To kill memory it came.
Now our hand filled again with fire to avenge the pain of our own, animals
again eating earth, dying persecuted and forgotten.
 
Now the drums called to war again.  Now the bat men and women prepared again
their flight of mortal death.  Now the night of pain came again to cover the
vengeance of the true men and women.
 
But there came, from where the sun walks, another voice that was not of
death.  It came great, with the wind it came.  Our hurting heart waited
and heard what that voice spoke.  That the war not go on, it said. That
death wait.  That the heart of the true men and women not be, yet, a mirror
of pain.  This we did.  The bitterness was put away in the caves and our
pain waited for that voice to shout.  The voice spoke strongly.  How could
we not hear it!  Many steps was that voice.  Great, the song of its drums.
Only the arrogant closed his heart.  Without fire, with a name and face, that
voice raised again the banner of human dignity.  For that voice, we were not
animals.  Men and women again, we were.  From other lands came walking
that voice.  From far away.  From the heart of other lands, from other
mountains, from other hopes, sisters to ours.  It became strong and great.
It is a voice.  Relief came to our pain, and the waiting harvested hope.  A
seed, was that voice, in the collective heart that walks in our step.
 
Brothers:  A name, that voice gives us.  No more are we the unmentionables.
 
A name have we, the forgotten.  Now our flag can cover, not hiding itself,
our dead and our history.  We have now a place in the heart of our brothers,
- you - and a small corner in the history that really counts: that of the
struggle.  Having now a collective name, we discovered that death shrinks,
and ends up small on us.  The worst death, that of oblivion, flees so
that the memory of our dead will never be buried together with their bones.
We have now a collective name and our pain has shelter.  Now we are larger
than death.
 
We have also the hope that just as we received a name, these brothers,
- you - will give us tomorrow a face; finish by putting out the fire that
lives in our hands; and, instead of the past, give us a future.
 
They smile, these lives of tomorrow and dead of forever.  They dream,
the bones of the men of wood in the mountains.  They dance, the men and
women of corn.  Joyful is our heart, although the body hurts.  A light lights
up these shadows that always dance with death, the true men and women, those
of forever.
 
We are named.
 
Now we will not die.
 
Come, brothers, we cannot go.  Great is the the strength of you all if you
make yourselves one.  Come, there will be no fire to receive your step, nor
will our heart be closed to your word.  Come.
 
A name we have.  Now we will not die.  Let us dance.
 
Now we shall not die.  Named are we.
 
Health, brothers!  Death to Death!  Long live the EZLN!
 
Democracy!
 
Freedom!
 
Justice!

and heard what that voice spoke.  That the war not go on, it said. That
death wait.  That the heart of the true men and women not be, yet, a mirror
of pain.  This we did.  The bitterness was put away in the caves and our
pain waited for that voice to shout.  The voice spoke strongly.  How could
we not hear it!  Many steps was that voice.  Great, the song of its drums.
Only the arrogant closed his heart.  Without fire, with a name and face, that
voice raised again the banner of human dignity.  For that voice, we were not
animals.  Men and women again, we were.  From other lands came walking
that voice.  From far away.  From the heart of other lands, from other
mountains, from other hopes, sisters to ours.  It became strong and great.
It is a voice.  Relief came to our pain, and the waiting harvested hope.  A
seed, was that voice, in the collective heart that walks in our step.
 
Brothers:  A name, that voice gives us.  No more are we the unmentionables.
 
A name have we, the forgotten.  Now our flag can cover, not hiding itself,
our dead and our history.  We have now a place in the heart of our brothers,
- you - and a small corner in the history that really counts: that of the
struggle.  Having now a collective name, we discovered that death shrinks,
and ends up small on us.  The worst death, that of oblivion, flees so
that the memory of our dead will never be buried together with their bones.
We have now a collective name and our pain has shelter.  Now we are larger
than death.
 
We have also the hope that just as we received a name, these brothers,
- you - will give us tomorrow a face; finish by putting out the fire that
lives in our hands; and, instead of the past, give us a future.
 
They smile, these lives of tomorrow and dead of forever.  They dream,
the bones of the men of wood in the mountains.  They dance, the men and
women of corn.  Joyful is our heart, although the body hurts.  A light lights
up these shadows that always dance with death, the true men and women, those
of forever.
 
We are named.
 
Now we will not die.
 
Come, brothers, we cannot go.  Great is the the strength of you all if you
make yourselves one.  Come, there will be no fire to receive your step, nor
will our heart be closed to your word.  Come.
 
A name we have.  Now we will not die.  Let us dance.
 
Now we shall not die.  Named are we.
 
Health, brothers!  Death to Death!  Long live the EZLN!
 
Democracy!
 
Freedom!
 
Justice!

I invariably, or at least variably, call O Books (Leslie Scalapino's
press) O Press (Michael Lally's lively press of the 70s).  I think
O! Press, but Leslie notes "oppress".
 
In an separate post, to follow immediately, I am sending a longish
letter to the editor by Alan Loney, a terrific poet from New Zealand.
I thought the letter might be of interest "here" even in the
absence of the review to which it responds.  Alan Loney has been
a subscriber to the Poetics List, but has recently signed off.  He is the
author of two recommended books:
 
Missing Parts: Poems 1977-1990 (Christchurch, NZ: Hazard Press, 1992)
 
and
 
The Erasure Tapes (Auckland University Press, 1994), which Loney
describes in the Preface as "an autobiography in which I refuse to tell
the story of my life."
 
I am not sure how people outside New Zealand can get these books,
or the (also highly recommended!) book by Michelle Leggott, _DIA_
(egad! another poet-scholar, the self-same author of the awesome study
of Zukofsky's 80 Flowers from Johns Hopkins a few years back
(_Reading 80 Flowers_).  But I think that Wystan Curnow and Tony Green,
who should be reading this message "now", might be able to help out?

Alan Loney
 
The Panic of Jane Stafford
 
Re: "The panic of O", Jane Stafford, New Zealand Books, Vol 4 No 3, September
1994.
 
For the past 25 to 30 years some of "us", i.e. writers who have generally been
considered to  be working somewhere on the margins of New Zealand literature,
have been on the  receiving end of a number of, shall I say, negative
adjectives attached to our work and the  work of others that we respect, by
"mainstream" authors and critics in book reviews. It is  an  impressive list,
and maybe it would be best to start by exhibiting it, in all its glory, just so
that we know clearly what is being discussed. Here are some of the more
frequently  applied: solipsistic, elitist, pretentious, obscure, empty,
cognoscenti, private reference, no  discernible  thought, resistance to
interpretation, provocative, smart-arse, clever, wilful,  self-indulgent,
contempt for the reader, ivory tower, writing for a coterie, intellectual,
pseudo-intellectual,  so-called postmodern, so-called "Language Poets",
excluding the average reader, void of  meaning, inaccessible,  etc etc etc.
Jane Stafford's review of Murray Edmond's The Switch  and Michele Leggott's Dia
, both recently published by Auckland University Press, contains  the first
fifteen of these. They are now, after all these years, nothing more nor less
than a set  of cliched insults, and their purpose is invariably to provide
excuses for refusing to actually  engage with the work being so characterised.
 
Jane Stafford's review of the Edmond and Leggott texts is argued, detailed, and
attempts to  get beyond the mere name-calling exercise that I have nevertheless
stated that it includes.  It  is therefore to be welcomed as providing a
genuine opportunity for reply in ways that the  mere name-calling  procedure
does not. But these negative terms are so repeated and  familiar in New Zealand
poetry reviewing that it seems less a matter of deja vu, than of a  kind of
ventriloquism - where the dummy keeps on producing its lines long after the
operator has vacated the premises.
 
Credentials and allegiances
 
Ms Stafford is at pains to establish a kind of credibility for herself, one
that is based on  credentials  - "I teach a second year university course etc".
Ordinarily, such candour is to be  welcomed. But one can easily compile other
paragraphs, one of which might begin :  "Murray Edmond is a lecturer in Drama
at the University of Auckland, is convenor of the   post-graduate Diploma in
Drama programme, and lectures in a stage 3 American  poetry  course. He is the
author of 6 books of poetry (several of them out of print) and so on".  Another
such paragraph might start with :"Michele Leggott is a lecturer at the
University  of  Auckland in New Zealand poetry, in American poetry, in
Australasian Women's  Literature, with a PhD from University of British
Columbia at Vancouver. She has  published 3 books of poetry (the first is out
of print), and her major study "Reading  Zukosfky's 80 Flowers " was published
by Johns Hopkins University Press on the  recommendation of Hugh Kenner etc
etc".  It's not my purpose to pit credentials against  each other here (that
would at the least be silly), but to make the more important point that  we all
have credentials of one sort or another. In a field like "literature" such
credentials do  not automatically confer guarantees of appropriate information,
approach, or judgement.  We are all contestable when discussions about values
are taking place.
 
Whatever else one thinks of the work of Michele Leggott, Murray Edmond, and,
let's be  clear, Alan Loney and any others with whom we are perceived to have
some sort of  allegiance, what one cannot say is that they all write in the
same way or that the works of  each are easily able to be confused with each
other's - by any attentive reading. And yet the  'critical' reception of them
by most 'mainstream' authors and reviewers is so familiarly  uniform that,
instead of getting genuine differential readings of these authors in reviews,
we're getting the homogeneous operation of an agenda, a false ideology which
specifies  these authors as a 'them' which can therefore, according to the
normal functioning of 'us  and them' patterns, be blithely treated by the same
unexamined, unsupported and  negative  terms and gestures.
 
What that agenda is I don't much care. What I do care about is the pretence
that genuine  critical reading is taking place; the pretence  that those
critics have some sort of 'ownership'  of the scope, purpose and condition of
poetry in New Zealand; and the presumptive  judgment that their reviled authors
are not serious about their life's work as poets or  writers; that they lack
integrity and competence of almost any kind whatever; that they  have no
respect for the work and works of others  who work outside their own writerly
project (my  respect for John Keats and for Mary Ursula Bethell for instance
would not even  be conceded as possible); and that they have no other apparent
motive for writing  but to  demonstrate to a small group of people who are
equally despicable that they are cleverer  than anybody else. These
assumptions, running throughout Ms Stafford's review, and  through hundreds of
reviews of poetry in this country in the last 25 to 30 years, are as cheap  and
unwarranted as anything she or anyone else directs at such writers as Murray
Edmond  and Michele Leggott.
 
 
A personal disposition or two
 
Ms Stafford's review begins in a mode of reasonableness and with a proper
pedagogical  concern for students of literature who are having to learn to
engage with unfamiliar texts.  It  reads like the kind of introduction that
might prepare one for the reviewer's own  engagement with the work of the
authors under discussion. Alas, it does not. What it leads  to, almost
inexplicably ('almost' as, one tends to expect this sort of response by now),
is this:  "Which is why I feel angry...". Anger? Why? What business has a
professional academic to  be 'angry' about texts to be discussed? Are they
advocating the pleasures of child abuse? Are  they suggesting people would feel
better if they beat the hell out of someone rather than  having all that pent
up feeling floating around? Do they propose ethnic cleansing in their  suburb?
Wherefore anger?  Ms Stafford establishes credentials, I would have thought,
for  being able  to discuss these works. What she actually says is: "I'm trying
to make a  connection with it. I can't." So. The reviewer's credentials, i.e.
her education, her  qualifications, her personal predilections, her teachers,
her colleagues, her peers, and her  reading, have not at all prepared her for
the works under review. One could very well be  angry about that. Instead of
acknowledging her situation however she has chosen to pour  scorn on the poets,
as if somehow they are to blame for it.
 
To take this point a bit further, there are other, telling, phrases that
support my concern.   Ms Stafford sees "a more sinister possibility"; "no
discernible thought here"; "so old- fashioned"; "smart-arse elitism"; "got a
nasty feeling"; "I'm damned if I'm going to"; "I  have this nasty feeling"; "I
find these two collections depressing" and so on. Why, exactly, is  all this
nastiness and bad feeling supposed to function as a proper basis for, or
condition of,  the elucidation of contemporary poetry for what Ms Stafford
deigns to call "the less  enlightened reader"?  We are not told. It is assumed
that the reviewer has these bad  feelings  in good faith. Ms Stafford has given
no one any reason to buy such a proposition.
 
 
The ventriloquist's dummy
 
Does this sub-title merely trade one harshness for another? Perhaps. But it
points to a view  of things, an agenda, a false and unquestioning ideology.
This ideology asserts itself by  using  a body of cliches, shibboleths even, in
order to obscure the meanings of others, and to deny  their actual differences.
Before I elaborate on this specifically, I want to expose a few  carelessnesses
and contradictions in Ms Stafford's text.
 
Keats's poem is "Ode to a Nightingale", not "Ode to the Nightingale"; Sterne's
book is  "Tristram Shandy", not "Tristan Shandy"; and "Morgenstern" refers
directly to the work of  Christian Morgenstern, and his wordless piece "Fisches
Nachtgesang" (1905) (and no, I did  not have to ask the poet for the
reference). It is, additionally, usual for assistance from  others - "A kind
and more literate friend" - to be identified in academic writings. And  rather
than ask how much less literate is implied by that "more", I would rather know
who  is doing the talking here? Or,  to put it another way, who's the
ventriloquist in this  instance?
 
A not uncommon kind of contradiction that appears in negative reviews is
exhibited in  Ms  Stafford's aside (to whom, exactly?) "a little Saussurian
reference for the cognoscenti?". It's  hard to take seriously the notion that
such a statement is directed to "the less enlightened  reader". If it is, how
do they, outside of, say, an academic environment, understand "Saussurian"?
This aside is also, I'm afraid, directed at a "cognoscenti", and a clear
distinction is therefore implied, like it or not, between the author's
'cognoscenti' and the  poet's 'cognoscenti' - ours and theirs, us and them. But
if she is, say, talking to me (and,  after all, I too am a 'reader'), then I
would say that she is not at all up with the play, either  with Saussure (who
dealt with spoken, not written language), or with Heidegger (who said  "It is
in language that things first come into being and are" (Introduction to
Metaphysics),  or  with Charles Olson's reliance on the work of Jane Ellen
Harrison for his assertion that  myth (the stories that cultures, oral and
literate, tell themselves about themselves) comes  first from the mouth. I
introduce these other writers here, not to show off my naturally  immense
erudition, but to signal that we all have such reading lists behind and
operative  within what we say. For all of us they are different of course, but
we all have these alliances,  allegiances  and engagements to one degree or
another. They are not the same kind of thing  as 'credentials'. If our 'reading
lists' are too different, and I am suggesting that this is likely  to be the
case as between Ms Stafford and the poets she reviews, then little wonder that
the  reviewer finds it hard to connect with the work.
 
However, it is the outright refusals that I find the most interesting aspect of
Ms Stafford's  review. First, the refusal to be (indeed the specific injunction
not to be) literal - "Don't be  literal".  If the literal is the first thing to
be denied of unfamiliar writing, then it's   understandable that a reader might
find a grasp of its metaphorical content hard to come  by.   If, as Ms Stafford
maintains, "a metaphor should expand meaning" (tho I don't accept this
formulation myself) then it's possible that the literal is one of the places
from which  metaphor can "expand".  It is, in any case, a perfectly reasonable
place to begin. That it  should be precluded, requires more explanation than a
list of other options, especially  when, for instance, my own teaching
experience suggests that it is wise counsel to keep the  options open until
they falter - in any given instance.
 
A further type of refusal is performed in the review when, in discussing
Leggott, the  reviewer writes that a particular passage "would be fine if I
knew what the last two words  meant". Those two words are "HYDROPHILE PURLING".
It is not I think too churlish to  propose the use of a dictionary in such a
circumstance. 'Hydrophile' is derived from  'hydrophilic', a chemical term
meaning 'having a strong affinity for water'. 'Purling' has,  as one of its
meanings (and the others are pertinent to the poem) 'flowing with a curling or
rippling motion, as a shallow stream over stones'. According to Ms Stafford,
she should  now be in a position to regard the poet's line as "fine". But by
refusing to even admit  meanings that are accessible to her, she has paved the
way for yet another insult to be  attached to the work, yet another opportunity
for the ventriloquist's dummy to steal the  show.
 
Another line of refusal is the refusal to give the poet the benefit of the
reviewer's own  insight as exhibited in the review itself. It is this
extraordinary strategy that  clinches my  claims about ventriloquism. Two
examples will do. In considering Edmond's poems 43  and  44, Ms Stafford
interrogates (properly) the text for meaning. Among her initial notes are
language play, sexual content, parallels with other texts in the book, the
presence in  English  of a large number of homographs - all good places to
start in establishing a field of  meanings for the poems. But just when this
beginning is noted she cuts off the flow of  elucidatory reading by saying "And
it gets worse". Worse?  How does a series of valid  insights (tho preliminary
ones, to be sure) add up automatically to a bad thing? In  considering Leggott,
the reviewer states that Elizabeth Barrett Browning is "an obvious  figure" in
the poem Dia,  yet notes that the reference to "the Portuguese/wind" etc "may
be  an allusion", and asks us to note her (Stafford's) "tentativeness" in
making the suggestion.  Well, what I've already noted is the strength of the
phrase "an obvious figure".
 
The most blatant refusal however is the reviewer's refusal to even consider the
poem  "Micromelismata". 'Concrete' poetry is historically a particular moment,
largely in  Europe,  but extending to Britain and the United States also,
within a wider context of shaped  poetry,  going back to the work of George
Herbert (died 1633) in England. Herbert himself knew of at  least one
predecessor for his work, an edition of The Greek Anthology, Theocriti Idyllia,
printed by P. Brubacchius, Frankfurt, 1545. To insist that it is legitimate to
reduce this  tradition to a mere fashion of c.1972, to which no critic need
return in order to speak of  newer writing is, I am sorry to say, no more than
an excuse for one's own ignorance, and  an  attempt to blame the poet for the
critic's failure of nerve in the face of the material reality of  the text. One
is of course under no obligation to like or admire any given text,  but one
does,  in public, have to deal with it in an open engagement.
 
What I am bothered about in these refusals is that just at that point when a
genuine critical  reading looks about to be achieved, Ms Stafford throws in the
towel. Again, an opportunity  to assist the "unenlightened reader" to deal with
a strange looking text is waved away in  favour of the agenda that requires
that these poets must be belittled and insulted rather  than read critically.
And of course the problem with reading attentively, generously and  critically
is that there is the severe danger of having to change one's opinion as the
result of  reaching genuine findings.
 
 
 
The news about elitism
 
As a lecturer in English at a university, Ms Stafford is a member of a small
band of elite,  specialist readers of literature. As an academic, she can claim
uncommon status as an  expert, and as a professional worker in the field of
literary criticism. The number of people  who get paid a salary in New Zealand
for teaching literature at tertiary level is, in relation  to the population at
large, very small. Now, books of poems in New Zealand are typically  published
in editions of between 500 and 1000 copies, and are very rarely (except in the
case  of anthologies used for teaching purposes) ever reprinted. There are some
exceptions  above  and below these figures, but 500 to 1000 copies is the
typical range. There are, at least, 1.5  million literate adults in New
Zealand. A thousand copies (let's be kind to the argument)  as  a percentage of
1.5million, is 0.066% of the literate adult population. Anyone who thinks  this
constitutes the democratization of poetry in relation to the literate
population at large  has, in my view, a lot of explaining to do. If that
percentage was closer to 66% for so-called  "mainstream" poets and 0.066% for
the likes of Edmond and Leggott, I'd have to admit  there was a point to be
made along these lines. But, it isn't, and there isn't. What it means  is that
poetry is an elitist proposition per se, at any level at which anyone reads any
of it. It also means that 'the general reader' or 'the general public' is not
the target group for any  publisher of poetry in New Zealand. Those of us who
are involved with poetry in any way  are all splashing about in the elitist pot
together.
 
 
The subjectivity at the end of the world
 
The last comment made by Ms Stafford denies that 'subjectivity' is an
interesting issue.  What I have attempted to show here is that it is primarily
the poets' 'subjectivity' that has  been on trial throughout her review. The
list of insults given in my first paragraph says it  as well as anything I can
end with. They are nearly all solely applicable to people, rather  than to
texts. If poetry needs anything at all from critics these days, it is close
reading, clear  and attentive critical analysis. One of the characteristics of,
as they say, 'our time', is that  there are many more and various backgrounds -
cultural, geographic, intellectual, and  personal and so on - than can be
neatly fitted or reduced to some monolithic sense of  "mainstream", to which we
are all supposed to conform. This does not mean, in my view,  that anything
goes. What it does mean is that a greater degree of care, of openness, and of
courtesy needs to be operating in the field of public letters, if we are not to
simply sit back  on  'us & them' perches and merely hurl insults at one another
under the privilege of having  access to print.

Dear Ron,
 
Yr question here has held me up for the past several days. If I
am averse to framing or self-interpreting my work, I am even more averse
to going into detail about my process. To put it bluntly, I don't believe
that this would be helpful to people as reader/viewers of my work.
 
I will try to elaborate a little on that if you or others want me to.

Ed, it's not the "humble mumble" that wears on me, rather all the
"unhumble mumble." But Gary is hoovey groovey, and probably does the
hokey  cokey pokey, perhaps even with his whole self.
 
I'm not certain who the editor of O Press was in 1978. But it's
interesting that the translator of the book in question, Gary, was
Annabel Levitt. Annabel had a press, I believe, in the late 70's/early
80's. I think it was at the 1982 NY Small Press Book Fair that I met her.  I
never knew her well, but I remember she was making some exceptional
books. I don't remember if her press was O Press, but I'll try to find out.
 
        all best,

I don't know how Wesley Tanner would think of being characterized as
AMAZING and HISTORICAL. He is alive & well, now in the midwest, but I'm
not certain if he's continuing to publish literature via ARIF imprint.

An interesting discussion all around, which i'll save and print out for some of
my first-year grad students in culture shock.  when u mentioned science i was
reminded that, in the strong and large research institutions, which tend to be
the prestigious schools where educational paradigms are hegemonically formed,
the humanities are always subordinated to the sciences, which are the
moneymakers.  thus humanists feel  under constant pressure to prove that we,
too, do "research" etc -- a constant legitimation crisis.  among the humanities,
the creative and expressive arts are embarrassing evidence of multiple modes of
inquiry and apprehension that threaten the hegemonic mode of the production of
knowledge --so they have to be repudiated, or, at best, tolerated with a kind of
arm's-length condescension by their more analytic discourse-cousins.  this is,
of course, a simplistic overview.  i don't think foucauldianism has anything to
do with this --if it weren't foucault's name that were being invoked in the name
of some discursive orthodoxy, it wd be someone else's.  i myself actually had a
rather pleasant graduate experience, in a program that was initially set up to
bridge that constructed gap --but then, i keep my "poetic" enterprises pretty
private.--maria d

This is a discussion that will not go away (various manifestations of which
has show up at least three times since I joined the list in Dec.) Some notes
towards thoughts about the ethics of poets remaining in the academy:
     First: both sides depend on a rather simple opposition of real work,
vs. work that is unimportant. In that the classroom emphasizes critical
work and talks of "creative" work as something resembling a hobby, or play.
Depends on the assumption that real work is productive of wages, your
critical work pays your bills, thus its your real work.
     The workshop (an academic sub-genre we can no longer forget) emphasizes
"creative" work as real work in a sort of romantic cult of the genius manner:
critical work pays the bills, but creative work releases the inner genius of
the poet and allows for real change and is thus real work.
     At this point, Tony's point about the somewhat specious seperation of
creative and critical needs to be made. Certainly this seperation was/is
historical?
     Maybe you've encountered this as well: in the workshop (whether
officially sanctioned by the academy and made a class, or whether a group
of folks who meet at the local coffee shop, or some mixture ofthe two, like
this list) offers the only real resistance to the various discourses called
theory I've experienced. One must not taint the sanctified ground of the
workshop with theory. Also, though, the rather typical CW student may find
him/herself somewhat patronized in the classroom as rather cute but not all
that important, as has been noticed previously.
     It occurs to me that the strict separation of theory with poetry may
have come about as poetry moved into the academy and was the result of
academic positioning? Perhaps a little off chronologically.
     Why stay in the academy? The answer has to be in my mind economic and
political. In here, you have the possiblity, however faint, of helping
students jump classes, as I did. Get them out of the ghetto/ tenant farm.
Has been so, I think, since the GI bill. Also to allow them participatein the
formation of the, for lack of a better term, canon, the standards of knowledge,
thus the multi-culti wars. This seems to me very positive, but as economic
conditions change, and pell grants and such fall away to pay for patriot
missiles, all over again, this justification may well go the way of
the trade union. What then do we do then, all of us academics?
     Thanks, Eric.

Hi Rae,
 
You aren't alone. I completley agree with you about Memory Play and am
planning to publish some of it, and other work by Carla upcoming, this side
of the pond. In that performance series I recently posted a Call for
submissions to.
 
It's a terrific work. Have you seen a performance? I saw a video of There's
Nothing Better Than A Theory (back on that discussion again) when visiting
Carla and Barrett four years back, so I've got some points of reference for
spaciality, movement, scenography. Can you describe it, aspects of the
performed version ? Energies, interfusional textures ? Voices ?
I've got an interest in producing a version here with Carla in the next
couple of years. We're talking here about how to make it possible. Be very
interested in your response.

Subject:      Re: Letter to the Editor (longish): The Panic of Jane Stafford
 
I have just re-read Alan Loney's long and fascinating letter and would
like to respond to it a little.
        My own perspective on New Zealand writing, different from Tony
Green or Wystan Curnow's, is as an ex-resident of Wellington, at the
other end of the North Island from Auckland, where Tony and Wystan are,
and where the best NZ collection of Language Writing and other post-war
American poetry is, where the American avant-gardists tend to be
invited and welcomed. I lived in Wellington for 2 years, and indeed
taught on the same 2nd year poetry course as Jane Stafford, who in my
recollection was one of the best and warmest of the twenty or so staff
at Victoria University there. It's true that, like a lot of people I've
met all over the university world, she doesn't understand or like much
avant-garde work; but she does teach a lot of very good but formally
conservative poets very well, and quite gratefully took on some of the
twenty or so poets I tried to introduce to the course, and to my
knowledge is still teaching them, poets like Louise Bogan and Carol
Ann Duffy. Given that, as Alan suggest, few people seem to read poetry,
and a lot are put off in school, I myself used Bogan and Duffy to meet
and then stretch my students' expectations, as part of a long slow
process of warming them to all the things Alan and I both love about
currently marginalised work. Jane may well not do this with her teaching,
but she at least has Bogan and Duffy in her handouts, and that might
inspire some students.
        What I want to say about Alan's post is that it seems to me
that no-one who isn't already a paid lit worker or academic gives a
damn about reviews, and they only care about teachers' opinions in so
far as the teacher cares about knowing where they're at - which, in
the larger context of the dumbing of people by school & state &
church, seems fair to me. Students *fear* teachers for their grades,
and care about their opinions usually only for that reason, and
therefore with an underlying short attention span (the length of
the course-unit) and underlying contempt. I get as angry as Alan does
about these reviews, but I don't think they matter very much.
        I have to say that one reason poetry goes unread, in what
seems even more shocking proportions even than England or parts of
the States, is that *all* the NZ scene is corrupt, not just the
mainstream. I like to think I'm a good acquaintance of Michele
Leggott, and I'd be the first to praise her efforts in getting 80
Flowers into print again - by writing the book about it, and by very
brilliant diplomatic work with Paul Zukofsky. And the book itself is
full of great reference-tracking and research. But I feel less impressed
by the writing on the poetics, and by the bulk of her poetry that I've
read. The Auckland American Poetry course that friends of mine took
is in just as much danger as any Wellington course, or any other course,
of telling you to agree and preaching self-evident quality or cool
in its own favoured writers. And the effect may mean that some writers
I admire more with the Aucklanders than with my Wellington colleagues
get onto bookshelves, yet alas they remain unread or read badly, just
as most of the Plath and Heaney required on Wellington courses does.
These unviersity courses all fail, in my opinion, to nurture the love
of *whatever poetry each reader could learn from and progress with*.
The ideal would be that teachers give skills in finding poetry and
trusting your own reactions to it (I myself *hated* a lot of writers
I liked later, that doesn't make me a bad person, as they say). What
usually happens is you wind up with a book of poems you've had a class
about, and you can repeat what the teacher said about it, but couldn't
put forward your own opinion, nor could you engage with another poetry
student who has a different favourite book, each opening each to each.
I'd like to see more emphasis on finding work you love, among students,
and *students* learning by teaching each other; instead of *teachers*
finding work they love and teaching it to thirty students at once,
with very little reciprocation of student teaching teacher. The rare
university teacher, or person, is the one you can come to with your
own project, wanting not expertise but an open mind and encouragement.
The sad thing about this for me, who's never met Alan though loves his
art-letterpress limited editions, is both Jane and he are better than
most people I've met at engaging personibly with students, with the
ideosyncractic mind; and this disagreement masks a potential alliance
between people who are both really good *teachers* - in a way that
is much more important, for me, to the future of poetry than badly
written "house-style" reviewing.
        (I also think every interesting New Zealand poetry person I
met or heard about is short-sightedly dismissive about all the British
poetry, avant-garde included, that I ever tried to mention..., but
that's another story)

Dear Charles,
         Posts re- Alan Loney's books will be forwarded.   Add to his
bibliography:
 
1         dear Mondrian. (with drawings by Robin Neate).  published by
Alan's hand-set press:  Hawks Press, Taylors Mistake, 1976, a classic
now o.p.
 
2         Shorter Poems 1963-77. Auckland University Press/Oxford
University Press, 1979.  O.P.??
 
3         Missing Parts poems 1977-1990  Hazard Press 1992
 
He also made some small edition publications with elaborate colour block
printing.  Squeezing the Bones (of which I don't have the biblio
details) and  Swell which I have here published under his imprint
Black Light 1987.  His fine printed books can be found in major
collections, e.g. the Bodlean Library, Oxford.   & Buffalo, I guess?
 
Add to that an essay   & The Ampersand  Black Light Press 1990  (the
poet Denis Glover once dubbed him Ampersand Alan, because of his
regular use of the ampersand in print)
 
His hand-set edition of Robert Creeley's "Hello" (the New Zealand section
only) is a particular fetish of mine.  It goes back to Creeley's
first visit to New Zealand of 1976 (200 years after Cpt. Cook), which
was momentous for many here.

Dear Eric,
         Your drift is interesting.  The problem I start from is not
"Creative Writing", but academic arts practice in Art History.  The
opposition you cite (useful and useless work) hits this practice, by
fastening it to pseudo-scientific projects and to pseudo-scientific
expository discourse, to make it "useful", i.e. Academically Approved
for Publication in Refereed Journals.  This tends to exclude (I'm
simplifying like crazy all the way today) narrative structures and
close-response writings, or even speculative commentary and
ecphrasis, all of which are included in classroom and privaste study
work with any artwork.
 
         But the opposition you cite is also precisely the one most
at issue in attempts to silence academic and intellectual
institutions under the guise of bottom-line economic measures.
Last Saturday's New Zealand Herald (18 March)had a full page story on
current attempts to destroy the independence of the Auckland
Institute and Museum, a major resource for anthropology, geology,
life-sciences etc in the Pacific region.  The politics ultimately
goes back to your opposition: if it don't earn a quick buck it is not
going to get money from the public purse.
 
           Carry the argument over into Information instead of
Tangible Product and you get very differnet answers to its use.
 
But worst of all, whenever an institution is forced into direct
control of local body politicians, it immediately loses its
independence of statement on social issues (in this case on
environment and  social issues, such as race relations).
 
Resistance in the classroom by any means available has to combat
some pretty deeply ingrained notions brought in by students, as
regards the uses of education and the discourse systems and the
direction and  control of intellectual efforts.

Maybe Red Rover would be a better model for editorial methodology than

X-To:         I.Lightman@UEA.AC.UK
 
Dear Ira,
         Thought I ought to respond some but first to follow through on
Charles' ask: Auckland University Press, University of Auckland, Private Bag
92019, Auckland, NZ is the publisher of Michele's, Alan's and also Murray
Edmond's book SWITCH which was the other work under review by Jane Stafford
and which I recommend to the list.
         Ira when you say *all* the NZ scene is corrupt, not just the
mainstream, and as though giving evidence you express reservations about
Michele's work, and suggest that our teaching here is as liable to fail as
teaching of poetry anywhere, I really don't follow. Even if the quotes were
supposed to be around *corrupt* rather than *all*--were they? The other
comment I can't really let go by was 'no one who isn't already a paid lit.
worker or academic gives a damn about reviews.' I can't agree. To begin with
the poets concerned, and all poets in my experience, *give a damn* and so
they should.
         Your comments are more about teaching, and you do mention  the
teaching we do do at Auckland. I just thought to say a couple of things
about it since you seem to suggest that your general comments about the
failures of poetry teaching can be readily applied to practices at Auckland.
The course which is liable to be mentioned is our 3rd year,full-year course
in contemporary American poetry which begins with the l950s. Of course, each
course constructs a canon, and it is the case the course has one which is
more or less the common ground of this list. However, its attention span is
longish (24 teaching weeks) and it is seldom one poet is taught more than a
week. Many poets are offerred, through lectures, through a course library
and reading room, tapes of all the poets and some videos, and students are
expected to develop enthusiasms, tastes of their own, through a
workbook-reading journal (although we're moving away from this toward a
portfolio idea at the moment). The course is team taught by three of us,
more or less alternating; each has a different approach, some students
responding more to one of us than the other two. We teach Wilbur, Lowell,
Sexton, Poet's Theatre (O'Hara-O'Harryman), Holzer, MacLow, Kerouac, in and
amongst the mix. But it is better not to talk about the one course because
the student chooses what the department more broadly offers and you'll
perhaps be reassured to know that Plath and Heaney are both taught here.
It is true Auckland's strength is in American rather than British poetry and
that was the case even when I was a student here. It is possible to study
20th American poetry at all levels and 8 members of the department do some
of their teaching in the field. It's not my impression that poetry readers
procuced by the department here are the victims my taste or anyone else.
But then I would say that. I'm *corrupt*.
 
            It would be good to have some Wellingtonians on the net.
When were you in the Windy City, Ira? There's too little contact between the
two cities, I have to say.

Subject:      Re: Memory Play
 
Dear Cris Cheek,  I'll jump in & give my 2 cents worth on Memory Play, I am
an American actor who was trapped inside the darn thing for ten months in a
workshop production here in San Francisco, and I'll tell you, it took me
eight and a half months before I figured out what it was "about."
Harryman, the author, and Philip Horvitz, our director, were always mum
whenever any of us actors asked, two Cheshire cats sitting there creamily
on the sidelines, always replying only, "You decide."  So finally I did.
Hope you're familiar with the film "Mildred Pierce," because "Memory Play"
is "Mildred Pierce" with a happy or at any rate conciliatory ending.
 
However I may be wrong about this.  Years ago I wrote a review of
Harryman's book "Vice" and stated forthrightly my belief that "Vice" must
have been influenced by CH's constant viewing of the US cop show "Miami
Vice."  Two minutes later the phone was ringing and she denied it, saying
she had never watched MV in her life!  Consequently I know a little bit
about "Memory Play" but don't go by me.
 
I played the "Miltonic Humilator" and had a wonderful costume, designed by
John Woodall, a kind of Worth gown and a huge Merlin type hat.  I had to
sing and dance in several production numbers, and taunt all the other
characters; finally, defeated by my own love for the Pelican, I succumbed
to a kind of Madama Butterfly swoon and killed myself-off stage.  It was
great, and Cris, you can see it on video if you have the VHS format over
there.
 
All the other actors were good, and I was a bit abashed because CH and PH,
realizing that the Miltonic Humiliator doesn't really have very many lines
in the published script, and perhaps not wanting to waste my talents,
allowed me, no, ordered me, to make up my own lines.
 
I remember initially during our first workshop version of "Memory Play,"
that Kathy Acker was playing the part of the "Pelican,"-I suppose CH
couldn't secure Kathy for the ten months it took us to rehearse and present
the play.  But think of her saying those lines, her great, scabrous energy
melting the proscenium.
 
Thanks for letting me put in my two cents on "Memory Play."
 
So long now-
 
Kevin Killian

Thank you Ed for one of the best quotes, one of the best, most pertinent
statements I've heard since I first signed onto this List. Bronk's
statement applies to a lot more than the discussion at hand. The problem
isn't just teaching. The problem is how much people seek, crave and demand
every conceivable type of imposition.

1.0     Intro: Some Dynamics
 
How does an electronic resource differ from an electronic list?
Importantly, the information is there, but _YOU HAVE TO SEEK IT_. This
active participation on your part is an important aspect to the
workings of the Center. Enter the web, follow links, send comments.
Wouldn't it be more convenient to have material mailed to your e-mail
account? In some cases this is preferable, but given the large amount
of material at the Center, your account would soon overload. There is
also so much material here that few people could store it in their
accounts. It's available 24 hours a day, 365 days a week (except for
system "down" time), an electronic all-night literary bookstore? Also,
unlike material that may be sent to your account, EPC material is
loaded with *hyperlinks*, i.e., connections to other places, other
times, other texts. Aren't books preferable? In some cases, this is
true, however, the book is a _fixed object_, i.e., electronic
documents can changed, updated, move in time to what is actually
happening.
 
The EPC makes available a wide variety of material. The description of
Internet information provided by the _Internet Services Frequently
Asked Questions And Answers_ (Version 1.7 - 4 February, 1994) states:
 
>The type of information you're likely to find on the Internet is
>free information, such as government documents, works with expired
>copyrights, works that are in the public domain, and works that
>authors are making available to the Internet community on an
>experimental basis.  Conversely, some types of information you are
>not likely to find on the Internet, most notably, commercial works
>which are protected by copyright law.
 
The EPC is testament to the fact that Internet resources do not have
to be "throw-away" information. As a working site for _active_ poets,
the material here is a good faith exchange of original and current
texts (along with literary "classics") provided to you as part of the
current conversation that makes poetry and poetics immediate and
interactive. These texts, in many cases, are more current than
available through any other source. No one in the Center is waiving
any copyrights but has trusted you with these emerging texts in the
spirit of free exchange that defines the our efforts.
___________________________________________________________________
 
2.0     Projects: Author "Home Page" Project
 
One of the newest developments at the Electronic Poetry Center is the
development of the author library. The goal of this project is to
provide authors related to or of interest to the EPC with a "home
page," that is a single access point to electronic texts by and about
the author.
 
These author home pages offer access to electronic files by and about
the author, bibliographical information about the author, as well as,
where available, photographs and other "documentary" information about
the author.
 
We welcome inquiries from authors about allowing us to host your home
page. For authors who maintain their own home pages, do let us know so
that we might possibly provide a link to your own site.

6.0     FAQ: About the EPC
 
The Electronic Poetry Center seeks to provide a central _place_
for Internet resources for poetry and poetics.
 
The Center continues to provide access to the electronic poetry
and poetics journal, RIF/T, and the archives of the POETICS List.
Needless to say, the EPC provides quality archival materials for
these resources, including search features to allow keyword searching
of the Center.
 
The EPC AUTHOR library offers texts and/or information about
contemporary poets in a variety of formats.
 
A number of electronic JOURNALS are archived and distributed by the
EPC. Journals distributed through the EPC differ from other e-journal
archives in a significant way: the texts presented here have been
checked and verified by their issuing agency thus at least getting to
you versions of electronic journals in collaboration with their
source.
 
These journals include:
 
        DIU / Albany
        Experioddi(cyber)cist / Florence, AL
        Inter\face / Albany
        Passages: A Technopoetics Journal / Albany
        Poemata - Canadian Poetry Assoc. / London, Ontario (Info)/
        RIF/T: Electronic Space for New Poetry, Prose, & Poetics
        Segue Foundation/Roof Book News / New York
        TREE: TapRoot Electronic Edition / Lakewood, Ohio
        We Magazine / Santa Cruz
        Witz / Toluca Lake, CA / via Syntax
 
For RESOURCES outside the EPC, we have written links to make seamless
connections to these resources.
 
The Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. Look here
also for Selby's List of Experimental Magazines.
 
The Poetry & Poetics DOCUMENT Archive provides access to a number
of documents of use to poets, teachers, and researchers. Here you
will find essay material and recent obituaries.
 
The EPC also presently offers GALLERY, SOUND, EXHIBITS, and an
ANNOUNCEMENTS area.

Subject:      what does it do?
 
It occurs to me that it might be useful to frame more directly a question
that has been skirted by previous threads on the relations between
poetry and experiment, poetry and politics, poetry and theory etc.  Namely,
what does, or should, poetry do?  I wldn't want to skew discussion
irrevocably toward the classroom, but my students, it seems to me, bring
to their reading of poetry strong, but not particularly well-examined
assumptions on this count.  The dominant idea seems to be that poetry is
written "from the heart," with the purpose of expressing emotions.  Now,
i wldn't want to discount the importance of emotion, but, as i'm sure
we've all encountered, this sort of definition often results in the
writing/reading of a lot of "Hallmark verse," as well as in the
establishment of a sort of poetry-as-therapy paradigm.  So, if these
widespread views of what poetry does are inadeuate, are we up to
formulating more valuable meta-statements?  Is there any point in such
an attempt?
 
And how wld these meta-formulations be tied to the sorts of delightful
microdynamics on display in the recent close-reading thread?
 
As for the big question, i suppose my own preference tends toward the
Blakean notion of cleansing the doors of perception...

I'm interested in this recurring formula, the hallmark-card verse, invoked as
anathema to all serious modernist/postmodernist sensibilities.  when i ask
students to research "micro-poetries," i include greetingcard verse as an
example of a micro-poetry.  how can these despised, commercial fragments --or
the paradigm of poetry-as-therapy, as in psychiatric-ward workshops --be
understood in terms of the "cultural work" they perform?  rather than dismissing
them out of hand as trite and derivative, how can we use them to understand, as
shoemaker suggests, the multiple "purposes" of poetry.--maria d

Steven Shoemaker -- Of course, as Auden wrote on the death of Yeats,
"poetry makes nothing happen....".
 
A question to all engaged in the academia/non-academia discussion ... has
anyone else found the academic experience driving one away from words?  I
found in my first quarter of graduate school that I wrote about 10X the
words I had written in 10 years of adult life completely devoted to the
written word, and remember with horror the day I couldn't locate
something in a document using computerized word search because there was
no language being used unique enough -- in fact, it often seems the
academic task to bring our language into conformity, which to my mind
runs directly counter to the poetic task of always trying to use first
speech....  My own response has been to move into visual work... Anyone else?

I checked Books in Print, and they had an edition listed for 1992! I

Re Maria Damon's question about the cultural work of Hallmark cards -- I
learned what was to me a revelation about this a few years ago when I
came to understand that for some folks I met through doing martial arts
who are not verbally articulate in any way, hallmark cards -- and popular

would get enormously upset if he felt that the new hit of each week
wasn't expressive of his own perspective, thoughts, and feelings -- like
they'd "gotten it wrong" ....  This fellow and others used the songs and

The value of these forms of writing goes beyond, perhaps, poetry.
Grice, for example, used psychiatric-ward writings and taped dis-
cussions in his research.  This research yielded the expansion and
adaptation of Kantian maxims to discourse analysis (i.e. the
Cooperative Principles of "relevance", "cohesion", "manner", etc...).
His findings are very political insofar as they disclose another
relationship between power and language (i.e. rights of passage
into discursive communities).  As far as Hallmark goes?  Who knows?

in relation to this, there's a scene in the movie Chicks in White Satin, which I
didn't see but heard quite a bit about, and which is about the marriage of two
women, a "trite" greeting card becomes a focal point of emotion, and, said the
friend describing the scene to me, what would otherwise have been laughable
became quite transcendently moving and convincingly "authentic." what made the
card a conveyor of "authentic" feeling,i believe, was the women's reaction to it
--their feelings.  these are the kinds of saturated moments that compel my
attention.  so thanks for your comments above about your acquaintances who you
identify as not verbally oriented --can you say more about how their feelings of
identification, of being spoken for, were conveyed? if they were convincing to
you, what was it that convinced you?  the vehemence of your martial arts
colleagues' expression?  the astuteness of their analyses? --maria d

Steve's question about what poetry should do makes me think immediately of
reframing the question to something on the order of "How might poetry
surprise us?" or "What COULD any particular entity BECOME?"  I think that
precalling this would likely phase out (prior to conception) many
possibilities.
 
Of course, I understand that this question relates to levels of truth.  At a
certain level of consciousness (that of the students to whom Steve alluded),
we have to address from square one the expectations of people for whom much
of what we suspect ourselves of being fluent in is brand new.

Subject:      Coercive teaching
 
Dear
         Yesterday afternoon I said in a tutorial (Art History Stage
III): "I heard a discussion recently [in fact Ira Lightman's comments
about American Poetry as taught in Auckland] in which someone claimed that
every department teaching poetry made students agree with their
views, because otherwise they'd give them poor grades".  Three
students agreed that at St I and II they felt themselves subjected to
some pressure, though one said: "it depends on who you're tutor is" .
          Another student denied it hotly, saying that in her experience it was
not like that at all, she had been encouraged to find out for herself
what she thought and what she pursued.  She went on to say that
this was the Contemporary American Poetry class she was talking about.
           I've sat in on Roger Horrocks's and Wystan's classes and
I've never thought that they were imposing a canon or criteria or
opinions on their students.
           I can't see what the personal warmth of  Jane Stafford or the
supposed corruption of  all New Zealand teaching of poetry has got to
do with Alan Loney defending himself as a writer from continuing
undermining by largely unsympathetic readers.
            It is a not insignificant fact that the review that Loney
objects to is in a magazine that has public money supporting it,
while the attempts to get a magazine published with more supportive
attitudes has been rebuffed.

In-Reply-To:  <199503230456.AA12058@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu> from "maria damon" at Mar
              22, 95 07:03:45 pm
 
Maria Damon asks what was so convincing about those folks who used
hallmark cards and popular songs as their own expression -- These folks
in general had their intelligence largely in their bodies -- the one
fellow in particular looked like Baryishnikov when he moved -- more than
in their brains, so to speak, so it sure wasn't astuteness of analysis....
I was convinced I guess because of these things:
- constancy of attention to and use of popular songs and cards over time
as a means of expression
- some anxiety each week waiting to see what the hits were on the radio,
and discussion as soon as they were known as to their accuracy and
appropriateness.  when songs weren't appropriate, genuine gut level
concern and response -- stomping about, going over and over what was
wrong, etcetera -- really upset
- in thinking back, one manifestation that should seem particularly
familiar to poets -- a fair amount of time spent trying to copy out
greetings or write down words to songs in a way that had to be accurate
from beginning to end -- one mistake and the paper is crumpled, have to
try again
- incorporation of words from cards and songs into daily speech, and some
dependence upon those sources of words, which constituted a fair
percentage of language used in either oral or written forms
 
Ultimately I understood that while these folks had all the same emotions
as we, they had no original means of verbalizing those emotions and thus
relied entirely on the language of mass culture as exhibited particularly
in these 2 forms, resulting in a complete identification with mass
culture.  I've come to understand language use on a spectrum of
originality, with poets at one extreme attempting always first speech,
and folks such as these at the other extreme, completely mapped onto the
most mass of mass culture, with varying degrees of embeddedness in the
culture in-between.  Academic writing, it seems to me, is writing engaged
always in the process of attempting to bring new ideas -- now make sure
not too many at one time, or too original -- into embeddedness in the
culture through coercion of language use into one might say dogmatic forms.
 
The impact of exposure to these folks -- and let me emphasize this is of
course not everyone involved in martial arts, but a particular group I
encountered in a particular place at a particular time (St. Cloud,
Minnesota, mid-1980s) -- certainly I've met many, many other folks
involved in martial arts of one form or another who are extremely
articulate.  In fact, I think Daphne Marlatt was the first person to talk
to me about Tai Chi, which is what I was studying.... -- anyhow the
impact on me of exposure to these folks was to have a completely
different appreciation of the role of mass culture.  And I have the
sneaking suspicion that there are more folks like the ones I'm talking
about than there are folks like "us"....
 
When I say St. Cloud I should also point out that the folks there came
actually from all over the country; the one fellow in particular from
rural upstate New York.  We were all gathered around a brilliant master,
the fellow who brought tai chi to this country, Master T. T. Liang, who
was then in his late 80s.... and I hear is still teaching, now in
Minneapolis, those of you who are there....

Perhaps "teach" is no longer such a good description of the activity I
increasingly find myself interested in.  I prefer, however inadequately
theory matches practice, a notion of "shared inquiry."  I don't feel I
have so much that I can "Teach" others--even those with less experience
in academic forms of knowing/saying--as much as I feel competent in
asking questions and provoking others to ask their own questions.  This
is only an initial stage of forming positions, of course, but a more
productive location than "teaching" or "professing."  For me.
 
So, why teach?  If that term covers the sort of activity I've just
described than I would have to agree to eric pape's earlier comments to
this issue and add only that there seems a responsibility to encourage
those younger than ourselves (or less familiar with the ways of the
institutions we work within) to take up--in their own way--their own
inquiries.  There needs to be those individuals who can provide models of
something other than the productions of media personalities that pass for
such at present.  Perhaps there are other reasons--and I'd be more than
happy to hear these--but there seems no other real reason to teach than
this: giving opportunity.

I keep thinking of the permissible shorthand (code) in place within mass
culture. In response to Sandra's thoughts, I'll add a concern that I've
watched:  people molding their emotions to a set of five or so listed on the
multiple choice test implied by, say, country or whatever songs. Learning to
feel what the song says.  And if a Hallmark card misses, well, why not just
adjust a little to the right and then claim/learn to internalize (or whatever
verb might be right) THAT emotion. All of this linked to whatever level of
empowerment.
 
This may be ONE of the challenges we face if seeking to share more unusual
(relatively speaking) forms of writing.  People have no place for it, on
account of their having been trained and eventually submitted to a system of
simplification which rules out first thoughts and therefore causes blending,
shaving, saming (not unlike what happens when construing a "movement").
 
Well.

 I think you're right, Maria, that this kind of poetry can do useful
 cultural work.  And also right that my schematic formulation risks a
 too easy dismissal of that work and participates in a history of such
 dismissals, which have, importantly, often been strongly gendered (e.g.
 Pound and "Amygism").  But what i was objecting to was not the existence
 of this kind of poetry or its uses, but the *dominance* of that sort of
 definition of poetry in mainstream culture.  That dominance often
 precludes "serious" considerations of other sorts of poetry (i guess we
 shld watch out for too exclusive definitions all along the spectrum).
 There are, for ex., always some, often many, students who, with the poetry-as-
 personal-expression in place, initially resist any in-depth consideration
 of the *form* of the poetry, on the assumption that such considerations
 are too ingenious, too self-conscious, not-what-the-author-was-thinking-
 about.  It's that sort of reductive approach to poetry that i often
 find myself needing to work to move beyond by suggesting other goals
 and possibilities.  This movement "beyond" usually involves some intensive
 "close reading," but a larger sense of other possibilities-for-poetry
 seems to be necessary for such reading to take place....

Subject:      Re: Letter to the Editor (longish): The Panic of Jane Staffo
 
Dear Wystan,
 
Thanks for your friendly and thoughtful response. You're right that I didn't
include the poets is my "no-one gives a damn", I was trying to address Alan's
remarks about the effect of reviews on *readerships*. In Britain, one
seldom gets any reviews at all, and then only hurtful ones, in any bigger
funded periodicals, but I don't know one should expect them. Reviewers are
hurtful and thoughtless about the poets, just as Alan's letter was hurtful
to me as an aquaintance of Jane Stafford, both she and Alan (to my knowledge
) were wrong in their character assessments of each other's motives.
 
On other points, I was in Wellington in the early Nineties, I actually *hate*
Plath and Heaney and Lowell myself (which I hoped I'd indicated in my post
before, emphasising that Alan and I *both* share the love of similar
"currently marginalised" work, as I said), and I would like to see other
Wellingtonians and Aucklanders on the list, who weren't themselves a bit
nervous of offending the Aucklanders already on the list and thus blowing
their publication and reading chances - a problem also in existence for
the Apex, G2 poets generation in America. I was hoping to flush them out,
at least privately, by my posting.
 
I hear yours and Tony's optimism for the course - it doesn't match however
the detailed accounts I've had of it from a good ten or fifteen people I
met who had the potential of being great poetry lovers, of avant-garde
work especially; that is to say, the ten or fifteen really exciting minds
I met. It's, of course, great that your course exists, and it does do
good. But what I said I still hold by. I mentioned Michele Leggott's work
not because I don't know the scene thoroughly - I do - but because she
is the poet I have the most hope for in NZ, and yet she has stayed only
good, when she could have been brilliant - but perhaps the new book proves
me emphatically wrong, and I am stereotypically seeing her on a typical
decline. Surely it is *very* important that poets be able to take criticism
that is hurtful, that is sometimes designed to ask them to win me over, to
be really astounding (by which I don't mean mainstream). It is when
feelings get hurt too quickly and without discrimination (on the part of
the reviewed as well as the reviewer) that there can be corruption, and
nobody can be honest, and that is what I meant.
 
Very best
 
Ira

I think Jeffrey hit on a key point: good teachers give opportunites to students
that they possibly would not have had.  Whether it's leading the student
towards good (interesting, important, usefull) reading, introducing them to
others with similar interests, or going through some form of a shared inquiry,
 any little bit helps.  Especially so when it opens students to new ideas or
communities.
Without teachers/writers here like Joe Amato and Andy Levy, I would still be a
hyperactive, frustrated engineering student attacking my neighbors with my
voice and a copy of "Fox in Socks"

that John Michael Scalzi, II
(scalzi@cris.com) sent to Newt Gingrich, in the wake of the discovery of
his comments on the biological urge of men to "hunt giraffes" and to
wallow in ditches "like little piglets":
 
Dear Mr. Gingrich:
 
   My name is John Scalzi, and I am a columnist for the Fresno Bee in
Fresno, California. In the days since the unearthing of your comments
about men, women, combat, and the biological drive for men to hunt
giraffes, I have taken it upon myself to conduct a poll to see whether
that innate giraffe-hunting urge (and the little piglet wallowing urge)
is in fact alive and well in the average American male.
 
   While the sample polled is statistically small (50 men, basically
whomever was handy at the time) and largely comprised of white, college-
educated, gainfully employed males, I nevertheless feel that the
information gleaned from this poll will be of some value to someone,
somewhere, some time. Perhaps you yourself, should the subject of
instinctual giraffe slaughtering come up again. Certainly for me, as it
takes up the bulk of my column, to be published this Wednesday, January
25.
 
   Thank you for your time, and happy hunting and/or wallowing, whichever
the case may be.

giraffe ranches?
Yes: 92%
No: 8%
 
8. When you see Geoffrey, the Toys 'R' Us giraffe, do you ever get the

I am preoccupied with these questions, working, as I do, primarily with
soldier poets and other authors of what I call "literature of trauma."  In
my forthcoming book, _Worlds of Hurt: Reading the Literatures of Trauma_
(Cambridge, October 1995), I spend a lot of time making connections between
poetry and power, therapy and politics.  I've done a lengthy study of the
work of poet W.D. Ehrhart (probably almost unknown in this crowd), who is
one of the most prolific of the Viet Nam veteran poets and who has also, by
his editorial efforts and grand collegiality, made it possible for a
generation of Viet Nam veteran poets to flourish.  The poetry of these
veterans is inseparable from their politics, from their strong antiwar
stance, from their rage at stupid death and needless destruction; the best
of them match Sassoon and Owen and Jarrell and all the other veteran poets
who get so little play these days. The same organization (Vietnam Veterans
Against the War) which acted as a catalyst for Viet Nam veteran writing was
also the birthplace of veterans' "consciousness-raising" groups--a
politicized form of therapy in which the power relation of the therapist and
the veterans was deliberately restructured so that all were equal
participants in the process of political growth and concommitant healing. It
must be emphasized, though, that the healing was believed to come out of
political action and that artistic work was political work.  The first
anthologies of Viet Nam Veteran writing (_Free Fire Zone_ and _Hearts and
Minds_) were published by activist poets as basement editions. _Hearts_ was
publshed by First Casualty Press, and all three foundesr are still working
as poets and writers today:  Wayne Karlin, Basil Paquet and Larry Rottmann.
 
But the invisibility of these poets in the academy is an interesting
problem.  Of the Viet Nam vet poets, only John Balaban, Bruce Weigl and
Yusef Komunyakaa have received much praise in literary academic circles and
these three are probably among the less *activist* of Viet Nam vet poets
(though they are all unabashedly antiwar and "political") and
(unsurprisingly) more connected to the writing workshop circles.  Those few
academics familiar with the field, however, are just as likely to value the
work of Ehrhart or Gerald McCarthy, Horace Coleman, D.F. Brown, Jan Barry,
Basil Paquet, or Leroy Quintana, and/or the related work of Viet Nam vet
"cowboy poets" Rod McQueary and Bill Shields. (Did you know that cowboy
poetry readings in the west can draw crowds of thousands?) There are a
couple of "pop" Viet Nam war poets, like Steve Mason, who have done well on
the trade market, but Ehrhart, for example, has a hard time getting
publishers for his poetry although the critics who write about Viet Nam war
literature write well of him.  (For a good summary of this field of poetry,
check out Vince Gotera's _Radical Visions_ [Univ of GA Press, 1994].)
 
I would not, of course, put "Hallmark poetry" and "poetry-as-therapy" in the
same class.  It's my guess that most poets find the writing of poetry
"therapeutic," and that the confessional/testimonial impulse is at the heart
of a great deal of the poetry we read.  It makes sense to me that some folks
who have experienced trauma (like some Viet Nam combat veterans, rape and
incest survivors, and Holocaust survivors) have a passionate committment to
convey their experience in a potent form--to make, quite literally,
world-changing fictions/poems. There is "Hallmark" confessional poetry (in
which class I'd put Steve Mason, for example), and then there is the work of
skilled craftsmen like Ehrhart or Quintana (who is best known as a
"Southwestern/Chicano poet"), which equals in power and beauty the work of
any of the "best" poets of the day.  Somehow, though, these survivor-poets
are rarely fashionable, tend not to be studied in the academy, or
anthologized regularly.  (Who reads Primo Levi's poetry now?)  I'd argue
that they're buried specifically because they *are* political, because their
work forces us to confront events-in-the-world and allows no retreat, no relief.

Maybe this will link the "academia" question to the "what does it do"
question.  Some years ago I was asked to give a talk at the MidWest
Modern Language Association.  They met that year in Kansas City, which
happens to be the world headquarters of Hallmark.  There was a panel on
the subject of Hallmark verse.  The subject of the subject was not
mentioned. Greeting card verse offers greetings, plain enough.  It also
generates sales.  (Remember the verse by the side of the road?  The
micropoetics of Burma Shave?)
 
I prefer Lenin's question, "What is to be done?"  Poetry _can_ do just
about anything, except perhaps disappear.  Asking a poet what poetry
"does" is a bit like spraying cat repellent on a cat.

tony green points out the problems with the  "they who use pop and  Hallmark" as
against  "we who could once use Wallace Stevens but who now have learned to use
Gertrude Stein etc etc"  model of critical inquiry.  I agree.  I'm uncomfortable
with we/theys that imply either monolithic wes & theys or dichotomized wes vs.
theys.  i love pop songs as i suspect most of the ultra-groovoids on this list
do, or have done.  "originality" is not the sole purview of modernist poets,
though it's their rallying cry. i hesitate to get into this turf here, but i
think academic people who are passionate about poetry can only gain by expanding
their embrace of other people's definitions of poetry.  Isn't the person who
waits anxiously to find out what the pop hits were, or copies greeting card
verse into a notebook, just as passionate about poetry as someone who peruses
Pound for hours on end to grok his prosodic mastery? --as someone who, until my
book came out, thought i was a "cultural studies person" with a private love of
poetry and now has a public/professional profile as a "poetry person" with a
cultural studies orientation, I feel caught between two discourse communities
when previously I didn't personally experience any discontinuity between them.

Yeah, sure (and I'll even qualify that...), but the only . . . (dare I
say MORAL) reason to teach has nothing to do with self-satisfaction
(unless it is derived from the MORAL) or with cash (though that is
necessary).  Perhaps MORAL is not the right word and I suspect its
geneaology.  Nevertheless, sometimes we take what we can get.  I agree
with Edward Foster, but beyond that?  Doesn't there need to be that MORAL
responsibility to do more than just earn cash.  Isn't that what it's
about?  Please . . . though, I use moral only to suggest the idea.  I'd
gladly exchange it with another terms.  Any ideas?

Who but Creeley could write the lines "one and one two three" and
call it a poem and have it revered as such?  Is not the "sophistication"
in this poem the reader's?  Maybe, to turn Tony's phrase a bit,
contemporary poetry is necessarily for people who've learned to
read every other kind of text.  This poem occurs because of
the weight and pressure of a reader's knowledge of poetry.  If it
anonymously occurred as a Hallmark ditty, would it resound? (I
suppose the occasion being "On your fourth child,or birthday or
something...)  I guess i'm asking, in my ignorance, could any
one else have written this and made it the same? (if we are going
to make social distinctions)

I'd agree here, but also--though the division between high and popular culture
is problematic to the extent that it denies any validity to the
study/appreciation of the latter--note that there is quite a difference
between Hallmark and Pound.  Though I'll leave that for others to account
for.  There are differences, certainly, and I, for one, would not want to
obscure those--though I am highly interested in why it is that someone
would find such fascination with Hallmark or whatever.  How about the
hullabaloo about The Brady Bunch?  I mean, why?  Because . . . .

        I question the usefulness of asking what should poetry do.
Recently in class we were discussing the threatening power of language and
poetry was by far the most reckless and endangering of all the genres.
Utopian/distopian literature ( We, 1984, Handmaid's Tale, The Republic)
Recognizes this immediately.  Plato points out that in a perfect world
there would be no poetry.  There would be nothing to challenge and no
tortured artist feeling the unquechable desire to express their emotion
lyrically.
        it is during times of repression or upheval that poetry
flourishes. Some of the finest examples of the written word have emerged
from areas where the mere act of placing pen to paper would sentence the
writer to a life of secrecy. An excellent present day example is Cuba,
where writers are drooling over donated Ray Brabury paperbacks and the
American Lit. display sponsered by the US Embassy. Sources such at this
network seem incredibly overwhelming when you realize authors in Cuba
hand stitch and bind their works together, often using olf cloth as paper.
 
I then ask not what does poetry do but why do you feel the need to read
or write it?

At that time in the province of pleasuregiving prosody some people were neurally programmed to dig the
referential & some people were neurally programmed to dig the unreferential.
The former tended to use hallmark cards (influenced in part by the fact that
hallmark promoted strongly proreferential TV specials) & the latter tended not
to send cards or make their own or send blank cards or send referential cards
that sounded unreferential ("season's greetings") Some people who were innately
predisposed to dig the
unreferential became anti-referential after they majored in "english". When they began to notice the strongly
referential quality of hallmark they also
became anti-pro-referential.  & some people who were innately predisposed to
dig the referential became
strongly anti-anti-referential after majoring in "english". Oh, in the same
province there were some people who were innately neutral between reference and
unreference. After some of them majored in "english" they began to question why
other people who may or may not have majored in "english" valued
hallmark card writers over non hallmark writers like gertrude
stein or ezra pound, or the other way around.

I am here picking up on a three-day-old item from Tony Green, wherein
he asks two questions, onbe after the other. First, how serious was
Olson as a historian, and then, how many historians cite him or his
views in support. As a person now writing history, but with only a BA
in history as any credentials, I would like to suggest that Tony not
see his two questions as two ways oif saying the same thing. All thru
history we have had serious historians who are not supported or
consulted by people who teach history, for example, in a university.
In class today (on Susan Howe) I told my students they could do
themselves a great favour by reading Olson's _Special View of
History_.

equivalence often seems to carry with an assumption of radical
transparency that threatens to make the "words themselves" (whatever
exactly that means) invisible, and leaves out all sorts of possibilities
for what poetry might do/be/seem/seam/dream...
 
It's interesting that Sandra Bramn brings in Auden because, even tho'
i've never been that into his poetry, i cldn't resist picking up
(actually putting on "hold" so it's not right in front of me) for cheap
from a used bookstore here a dusty 5 vol set of Poetry in the English
Language (or something like that) edited by Auden and Norman Holmes
Pearson (I think) & published by Viking in the '50s.  I'm not sure
that qualifies as a groovy find, BUT ANYWAY I've always found it
interesting that everyone always quotes that Auden line "poetry makes
nothing happen," but they don't quote the rest:
 
For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its saying where executives
Would never want to tamper; it flows south
From ranches of islolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.
 
 
So, speaking of close reading, anyone have any idea what he "meant" by
that?

Dear Jeffrey,
            As perhaps the person who destroyed the best minds of Ira
Lightman's generation I am now hesitant of offer an answer to the question.
(are you out there,Ira? What can I say?) But for my money yes there has to
be I'd say a POLITICAL reason for teaching. Aiming to make people passionate
about poetry, or passionate about anything come to that doesn't do it for
me. Passionism is too close to consumerism, as is Hallmark poetry. Teaching
has to do with the dissemination of ideas, and that includes poetry.
Teaching takes place in a culture that is shaped by ideas. The politics
comes about through the relation of the ideas taught to the ideas that shape
the culture ( a student may well bring just those ideas to the class room).
Either the teaching of poems confirms the culture, or it resists it in some
fashion. Either act is political. My interest is in the second of the
options. How do we distinguish between consumerism and dissemination?

Yes those pop songs do sometimes express "our" feelings, Chris & Sandra.
I'm not so sure about the Hallmark verse, but I find the discussion of
such possibilities and inclusions into personal speech marvelous. I
certainly find that my family members (I am child of parents who each had
eight or more siblings, leaving an extended family mostly in Oklahoma)
use such cards quite seriously, not just as a convenience, and that I am
sometimes considered odd for sending blank card with longish notes I have
written -- odd but welcome.
 
I think also we take ourselves too seriously in considering our poetry to
be "first thoughts" (Sheila Murphy used this term, perhaps not so
intentionally moving from the "first speech" Sandra had proposed). I've
always liked Robert Duncan's various assertions that he was a
"derivative" poet, taking from a great variety of sources (many of which
were also derivative). While the linguistic substance/forms we use may
have some chance of being original, the thoughts therein have been
thought before, I would imagine, more often than not. I'd probably be
just as upset or uplifted if another poet captured my exact feelings as
if a pop musician did.

Steve Shoemaker -- At 20 I had that entire Auden poem on yeats up on my
wall; the year before it had been Gary Snyder's poem about work; perhaps
an effort even in the hubris of youth (this now long ago) to seek
humility as a goal....  And always took from the Auden the notion that
one keeps on doing poetry because it is a way of being, NOT because it
makes something happen... Although even at 20 that was, I confess,
colored by acceptance of the notion of Rav Nachman of Bratslav -- the
great Hasidic storyteller -- that one never actually knows to whom one is
speaking -- one might be answering not the person standing before you,
but a question asked by someone else hundreds of years ago....
 
I like Tony Green's sense that wherever we are on the poetry scale,
Hallmark or Olson, we're moving ahead of the language we know, the
difference being the range to which the individual has already been
exposed....  I think that captures it fairly, without value judgments and
in acknowledgment of that entire range as validly poetry....

CONTRACT WITH AMERICA UNDERWEAR DEBUTS!!!
 
Center for Book Arts
626 Broadway, 5 Fl, New York, NY  10012 (212) 460-9768
 
Pillars of the Clean Order
 
on view for one week only:
March 28 through April 4, 1995
OPENING RECEPTION: Wednesday, March 29, 6-8 PM
 
CENTER FOR BOOK ARTS is proud to present, for one week only, an
installation by artists Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese. The
exhibition incorporates recent publications by leading conservatives,
as well as the artists' own limited edition version of the Republican's
Contract with America.  Ligorano/Reese's recontextualized Contract,
however, has the tenets of the Contract printed on the seats of men's
and women's pure cotton briefs.  The face of Newt Gingrich adorns
the crotch.
 
The Ligorano/Reese Contract with America underwear is published
in an edition of 120 signed and numbered copies.  These special
artists' works will be for sale throughout the run of the exhibition.
On the opening night of the exhibition, they will be on sale for a
special price.  After the opening, they can be found at Exit Art's
Apartment Store.
 
The installation at the Center for Book Arts comments on the
overabundance of trade books authored by conservatives.  Oliver
North, Dan Quayle, Pat Robertson, Rush Limbaugh, John Danforth, and
Barbara Bush, to name a few, have all penned major trade
publications promoting conservative thought. The gallery space will
be dominated by heaps of dirty laundry overflowing from hampers.
Rising from the hampers, classical columns will display the recently
published books by John Danforth (Resurrection), William Bennett
(Book of Virtue), and Oliver North's (One More Mission).  On a
clothesline strung above the hampers and stretched throughout the
gallery will hang Ligorano/Reese's underwear version of the
Contract.
 
There will also be a point of purchase display video highlighting the
underwear.  The video recycles imagery from Ronald Reagan's 1984
"Morning In America" spots combined with fashion shots of models
wearing the underwear.
 
The Center for Book Arts is located at 626 Broadway, 5th Fl., between
Bleecker and Houston.  Gallery hours are 10 am - 6 pm, Monday
through Friday, and 10 am - 4 pm on Saturdays.

The question "why teach," for me, begs the question "why learn."  A
pedagogic practice that only takes into account the shaping of
another's (the student's) mind, without the concurrent awareness of
power (the teacher's) in a class as well as the willingness (of the
teacher) to learn, serves to create institutional clones.  That one
enters a space with certain assumptions, agendas, positions etc.
indeed makes the act of teaching a political one.  What is more
crucial is whether one teaches to learn, whether one can unlearn the
habit of always hearing only what one already understands.
On this point, I have to say that I have been a student in Wystan
Curnow's now (in)famous course, some years back (team taught, as he
pointed out)--and it was marked with an openness not common in many
university (poetry) courses.  It is the recognition of the power that
goes with the privilege of disseminating knowledge, as well as the
effort to hear and learn from students (too often seen as blank
slates onto which one can inscribe one's cemented ideas) that
distinguishes "good" teachers; something I appreciate (as a
student--still!) from former teachers like Peter Quartermain, as well
as certain profs. here at SFU.

Ed  -  respond   -   from Latin 'respondere' meaning 'promise in return'.
The spondere or promise is source of sponsor and spouse. According to my
dictionary of origins (Bloomsbury) the notion of 'obligation' survives in
the derivative 'responsible'.     But i've always liked Duncan's take from
'The Law I Love Is Major Mover':
 
'Responsibility is to keep
     the ability to respond.'

I asked my teacher about this piece today. She assured me that he
originally drafted it as part of a bulk commission for Hallmark cards to
comfort those who had to make (should that be pay) a visit to the Dentist
but Hallmark's response was that (and I quote):
 
'1) the overall tone is too obtuse for our readers
 
 2) percentage flossers among executives is highest per capita of the
population. These being the very people who can afford to afford private
health care and are therefore already partially
pyscho-economically-comforted the target marketing is way off beam
 
 4) double emphasis on 'it survives' might unnerve some purchasers
 
 5) the appeal to oral forms of poetry is inappropriate given the state of
the average gum or jaw post dental surgery / cosmetics  -  when sitting
quietly in a darkened room with a 'good' read is the more urgent option.'
 
Unfortunately this debriefing doesn't develop the obvious paradox of
reading in a darkened room. Nor does it sufficiently explicate the 'tongue
in cheek' factor required. I believe Auden's next attempt went some way
into the rich territory afforded by such. Whatever, the results failed to
sell, unlike his rhyming couplets of 'The Night Train' for the Royal Mail
service and being quickly withdrawn from the market his most, arguably,
niche work has been lost to us.
 
Or have I been reading the subject heading all wrong. Is it a rhetorical
question that is restricted by the e-format, when it should it fact read
 
"what does?"
"it do"

Insurgent Subcommander Marcos.
 
Mexico, March of 1995.
 
P.S. That, in mourning, cries.  I was listening on the little tape-player to
that one by Stephen Stills, from the album Four Way Street, that goes: "Find
the cost of freedom, buried in the ground.  Mother Earth will swallow you,
lay your body down.."  when my alter ego comes running and tells me:  It
looks like you got your way...
 
- Could it be the PRI has already fallen? - I ask with hope.
 
- No way! ... They killed you - says my alter ego.
 
- Me!  When?  Where?  - I ask while I go through my memories of where I've
been and what I've done.
 
- Today, in a confrontation... but they don't say just where -, he responds.
 
- Oh, good!... And did I end up badly hurt or really dead? - I insist.
 
- Completely dead.. that's what the news says - says my alter ego and leaves.
 
A narcisistic sob competes with the crickets.
 
- Why are you crying? - asks Durito while he lights his pipe.
 
- Because I can't attend my burial.  I, who loved me so much...
 
P.S.: That tells what happened to the Sup and Durito in the 12th day of the
withdrawal, of the mysteries of the Cave of Desire, and of other unfortunate
events that today make us laugh, but at that time took away even our hunger.
 
- And if they bomb us? - asked Durito in the early morning of the 12th day of
the withdrawal. ("What kind of withdrawal, a pure run," says Durito.)  It's
cold.  A grey wind licks with its icy tongue the darkness of trees and earth.
 
I'm not sleeping, in solitude the cold hurts twice as much.  Nevertheless I
keep quiet.  Durito comes out from his sheltering leaf and climbs up on top
of me.  To wake me up, he starts tickling my nose.  I sneeze with such
emphasis that Durito ends up, tumbling over himself, on my boots.  He
recovers and gets back to my face.
 
- What's up? - I ask him before he tickles me again.
 
- And if they bomb us? - he insists.
 
- Yes.. well.. well.. we'll look for a cave or something like that to hide
ourselves in... or we'll climb in a little hole... or we'll see what to do -,
I say with annoyance, and look at my watch to insinuate that it isn't the
hour to be worrying about bombings.
 
- I won't have any problems.  I can go anywhere.  But you, with those big
boots and that nose... I doubt that you'll find a safe place -, says Durito
as he covers himself again with a little huapac leaf.
 
- Psychology of terror -, I think, about the apparent indifference of Durito
regarding our fate...
 
- Our?  He's right!  He won't have problems, but me... - I think, I get up
and speak to Durito: - Psst... Psst... Durito!
 
- I'm sleeping -, he says from under his leaf.
 
I ignore his sleep and begin talking to him:  - Yesterday I heard Camilo and
my alter ego saying that there are a lot of caves around here.  Camilo says
he knows most of them.  There are small ones, where an armadillo would barely
fit.  And there are big ones like churches.  But he says there is one no one
dares to enter.  He says there is a ugly story about that cave.  The cave of
desire, he says they call it.
 
Durito seems to get interested, his passion for detective novels is his ruin.
 
- And what is the story of that cave? -  Well... It's a very long story.
I've heard it myself, but that was years ago now...I don't remember it well-,
I said, making it interesting.
 
- Fine, go on, tell it - says Durito, more and more interested.
 
I light my pipe.  From within the aromatic smoke comes the memory, and with
it...
 
The Cave of Desire.
 
It happened many years ago.  It is a story of a love that was not, that was
left just like that.  It is a sad story... and terrible - says the Sup
sitting on one side, with his pipe in his lips.  He lights it, and looking at
the mountain, continues:  "A man came from far away.  He came, or he already
was there.  No one knows.  It was back in other times long past and however
that may be, in these lands people lived and died just the same, without hope
and forgotten.  No one knows if he was young or old, that man.  Few are those
who saw him the first times.  It was like that because they say that this man
was extremely ugly.  Just to see him produced dread in men and revulsion in
women.  What was it that made him so unpleasant?  I don't know, the concepts
of beauty and ugliness change so much from one age to another and from one
culture to another.. In this case, the people native to these lands avoided
him, as did the foreigners who were the owners of land, men, and destinies.
The indigenous people called him the Jolmash or Monkey-face; the foreigners
called him the Animal.
 
The man went into the mountains, far from the gaze of all, and set to work
there.  He made himself a little house, next to one of the many caves that
were there.  He made the land produce, planted corn and wheat, and hunting
animals in the forest gave him enough to get by.  Every so often he went down
to a stream near the settlements.  There he had arranged, with one of the
older members of the community, to get salt, sugar, or whatever else the man,
the Jolmash, didn't obtain in the mountains.  The Jolmash exchanged corn and
animal skins for what he needed.  The Jolmash arrived at the stream at the
time when the evening began to darken and the shadows of the trees advanced
night onto the earth.  The old man was sick in his eyes and couldn't see
well, so that, with the dusk and his illness, he couldn't make out the face
of the man who caused so much revulsion in the clear light.
 
One evening the old man didn't arrive.  The Jolmash thought that maybe he had
mistaken the hour and arrived when the old man had already gone home.  To
make no mistake, the next time he made sure to arrive earlier.  The sun still
had some fingers to go before it wrapped itself in the mountains, when the
Jolmash came near the stream.  A murmur of laughter and voices grew as he
approached.  The Jolmash slowed his steps and came silently nearer.  Among
the branches and vines he made out the pool formed by the waters of the
stream.  A group of women were bathing and washing clothes.  They were
laughing.  The Jolmash looked and stayed quiet.  His heart became only his
gaze, his eyes his voice.  It was a while since the women had gone and the
Jolmash stayed on, looking... Now the stars rained down on the fields  as he
returned to the mountains.
 
I don't know if it came from what he saw, or from what he thought he saw,
whether the image that was engraved on his retina corresponded to reality or
if it existed only in his desire, but the Jolmash fell in love or thought
that he fell in love.  And his love was not something idealized or platonic,
it was quite earthy, and the call of the feelings that he bore was like a war
drum, like a lightning that becomes fierce rain.  Passion took his hand and
the Jolmash began to write letters, love letters, lettered delirium that
filled his hands.
 
And he wrote, for example, "Oh, lady of the wet glimmer!  Desire becomes a
proud leaping colt.  Sword of a thousand mirrors is the yearning of my
appetites for thy body, and in vain rips the double edge of the thousand
pantings that fly on the wind.  One grace, long sleeplessness!  One grace I
ask thee, lady, failed repose of my grey existence!  Let me come to thy neck.
 
Allow that to thy ear climbs my clumsy longing.  Let my desire tell thee,
quiet, very quiet, that which my breast silences.  Do not look, lady so not-
mine, at the poor mess which adorns my face!  Let thy ears become thy gaze;
give up thy eyes to see the murmurs that walk within me, longing for thy
within.  Yes, I wish to enter.  To walk thee, with sighs, the path that hands
and lips and sex desire.  Within the mouth, she wet and I thirsting, to enter
with a kiss.  On the double hill of thy breast to run lips and fingers, to
awaken the cluster of moans that in it hide.  To march to the south and to
take prisoner thy waist in warm embrace, burning now the skin of the belly,
brilliant sun announcing the night that below is born.  To evade, diligent
and skillful, the scissors on which thy grace goes and whose apex promises
and denies.  To give thee a tremor of cold heat and arrive, whole, to the
moist stirring of desire.  To secure the warmth of my palms in the double
warmth of flesh and movement.  One slow first step, a light trot next.  After
that the runaway ride of bodies and desire.  To reach the sky, and then fall.
 
One grace, promised tiredness!  One grace I ask thee, lady of the quiet sigh!
 
Let me come to thy neck!  In it I am saved, far off I die.."
 
One night of storms, like his passion burning his hands, a bolt of lightning
burnt down the little house of the Jolmash.  Wet and shivering, he took
refuge in the neighboring cave.  With a torch he lit his way in and found
there little figures of couples giving and receiving, the pleasure worked in
stone and clay.  There was a spring, and little boxes that when opened, spoke
of terrors and marvels that had passed that and would come to be.  The
Jolmash now could not or would not leave the cave.  There, he felt the desire
fill his hands once more and wrote, weaving bridges to nowhere...
 
"A pirate am I now, lady of the longed-for port.  Tomorrow, a soldier at war.
Today, a pirate lost in trees and lands.  The ship of desire unfolds its
sails.  A continual moaning, all tremor and wanting, leads the ship between
monsters and storms.  Lightning illuminates the flickering sea of
desperation.  A wet salt takes the command and the helm.  Pure wind, word
alone, I navigate seeking thee, among sighs and panting, seeking the precise
place the body sends thee.  Desire, lady of storms to come, is a knot hidden
somewhere by thy skin.  Find it I must, and muttering spells, untie it.  Free
then shall be thy longings, feminine swayings, and they will fill thy eyes
and mouth, thy womb and innards.  Free one moment only, as my hands already
come to make them prisoners, to lead them out to sea in my embrace and with
my body.  A ship shall I be and restless sea, so that in thy body I enter.
And there shall be no rest in so much storm, the bodies moved by so many
capricious waves.   One last and ferocious slap of salty desire hurls us to a
beach where sleep arrives.  A pirate am I now, lady of tender storm.  Don't
await my assault, come to it!  Let the sea, the wind, and this stone become
ship be witnesses!  The cave of desire!  The horizon clouds over with black
wine, now we are arriving, now we go..."
 
So it happened, they say.  And they say that the Jolmash never again left the
cave.  No one knows whether the woman to whom he wrote the letters existed in
truth or was a product of the cave, the Cave of Desire.  What they say is
that the Jolmash still lives in it, and whoever comes close becomes sick with
the same, with desire...
 
Durito has followed the whole story attentively.  When he sees I have
finished, he says:  We have to go.
 
- Go?  - I ask, surprised -  Of course! - says Durito -.  I need literary
advice to write to my old lady...
 
- You're crazy! - I protest.
 
- Are you afraid? - asks Durito ironically.
 
I waver.
 
- Well.. afraid, really afraid...no.. but it's very cold... and it looks like
it's going to rain... and.. yes, I'm afraid.
 
- Bah!  Don't worry.  I'll go with you and I'll be telling you where.  I
think I know where the Cave of Desire is -, says Durito with certainty.
 
- All right -, I say, giving in.  - You'll be in charge of the expedition-.
 
- Great!  My first order is that you march in the vanguard, in the center
nobody, to disconcert the enemy, and I will go in the extreme rearguard-,
indicates Durito.
 
- I?  In the vanguard?  I protest! - Protest denied! - says Durito with
firmness.
 
- O.K., soldier to the end, I'll go along.
 
- Good, that's what I like.  Attention!  This is the plan of attack:
First:  if there are many, we run.
 
Second:  If there are a few, we hide.
 
Third:  If there isn't anyone, forward, for we were born to die! - dictates
Durito while he prepares his little pack.
 
For a war plan it seemed too cautious for me, but Durito was the chief now,
and given the circumstances, I had no reason to object to prudence marching
in the vanguard.
 
Above the stars started to be smudged out...
 
- It looks like it's going to rain-, I said to Durito, excuse me, to the
chief.
 
- Silence!  Nothing will detain us! - shouts Durito with the voice of the
sergeant in that Oliver Stone film called Platoon.
 
A gust of freezing wind and the first drops...
 
- Haaalt! - orders Durito.
 
The drops of rain start to multiply...
 
 
- I forgot to mention the fourth point of the plan of attack.. - says Durito
with doubt.
 
- Oh yeah?  And what is it?  - I ask insidiously.
 
- If it starts to rain... Strategic withdrawal! -  The last words are said by
Durito now in an open run back to camp.
 
I ran behind him.  It was useless.  We got soaked, and shivering, we reached
the little plastic roof.  It rained as if desire had, at last, been
unleashed...
 
Go on again.  Health, and that the hunger for tomorrow be a desire to
struggle... today.
 
The Sup, inside, far inside, of the Cave of Desire.
 
It's March, it's early morning, and for being dead, I feel verrry well.

What does it do too?
It's not quite, as Lindz put it, that Plato "points out that in a perfect
world there would be no poetry."  Book Ten of the Republic argues that
there should be no poets in the ideal republic.  Plato, in the end, and
speaking thru Soc., invites poets to refute his arguments, in verse, and
allows as how he's prepared to relent.  Here, then, is at least one
project for poets!  As Plato knew, we won't leave, even if invited.
 
As a former resident of the District of Columbia, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the U.S. Congress, I take the question of poets in the
Republic rather seriously.  We probably don't have to look to far for the
reasons that the Library of Congress changed its poetry reading schedules
so that most residents of D.C. would no longer be able to attend.  Most
of our recent U.S. Poet Laureates have made an insistence upon not moving
to D.C. a condition of their accepting the position.  One thing that D.C.
poets try to do, even when living in California as I do, is to render the
problematics of langauge and representation as literally as possible.
Newt plans to make D.C. a "lab" for the Republican third
wavenewworldordercontractmoralrecission.  It is not too hard to imagine
the place of D.C. poetry in his vision, just watch him on Empowerment
Television.  Since Creeley's name has been mentioned much in this

Subject:      Sidney
 
Dear Aldon:
 
        As Sidney's name has been bandied about and you challenge
the poets to respond to Plato, I thought a taste of Sidney's
_Defense of Poetry_(c. 1580)
 
        "But now indeed my burden is great; now Plato's name
is laid upon me, whom, I must confess, of all philosophers I have
ever esteemed most worthy of reverence, and with good reason:
since of all philosophers he is the most poetical.  Yet if he
will defile the fountain out of which his flowing streams have
proceeded, let us boldly examine with what reasons he did it....
        And a man need go no further than to Plato himself to
know his meaning: who, in his dialogue called _Ion_ giveth high
and rightly divine commendation unto poetry.  So as Plato,
banishing the abuse, not the thing, not banishing it, but giving
due honour unto it, shall be our patron, and not our adversary.
For indeed I had much rather (since truly I may do it) show their
mistaking of Plato (under whose lion's skin they would make an
ass-like braying against poesy) than go about to overthrow his
authority; whom, the wiser a man is, the more just cause he shall
find to have in admiration; especially since he attributeth unto
poesy more than myself do, namely, to be a very inspiring of a
divine force, far above man's wit, as in the fornamed dialogue is
apparent."
 
        For those not satiated by this sound bite, see "A Defense
of Poetry," in _Miscellaneous Prose of Sir Philip Sidney_ edited
by Katherine Duncan-Jones and Jan Van Dorsten, for Sidney's full
argument, the first of its kind in English.

The week of March 6 was so busy for me that I had no time to

I'm in the middle of _Intimate Letters_, Janacek's correspondence

are stacked up, and I'm waiting for the new books by Rae Armentrout
and Carla Harryman (mentioned here w/in the last week; but I'm not
near my booklist and alas can't remember the names) as well as
Jessica Grim's Locale. Also eagerly awaiting the new (18th)

doing something useless, that is discovering something not

another a turn away promotes a turn to. Bending your verse

Kali Tal writes that...
 
"...the confessional/testimonial impulse is at the heart
of a great deal of the poetry we read.  It makes sense to me that some folks
who have experienced trauma (like some Viet Nam combat veterans, rape and
incest survivors, and Holocaust survivors) have a passionate committment to
convey their experience in a potent form--to make, quite literally,
world-changing fictions/poems. There is "Hallmark" confessional poetry (in
which class I'd put Steve Mason, for example), and then there is the work of
skilled craftsmen like Ehrhart or Quintana (who is best known as a
"Southwestern/Chicano poet"), which equals in power and beauty the work of
any of the "best" poets of the day.  Somehow, though, these survivor-poets
are rarely fashionable, tend not to be studied in the academy, or
anthologized regularly.  (Who reads Primo Levi's poetry now?)  I'd argue
that they're buried specifically because they *are* political, because their
work forces us to confront events-in-the-world and allows no retreat, no
relief."
 
This is terrifyingly interesting territory.
 
The intersection and differences of "confession/testimony" and the
intention of poetry to "force us to confront events-in-the-world"
 
        (perhaps one shd simply say that poetry actually presents
        events in the world and that this is something that other
        traditions of expression are not organized to do. Sometimes
        this is being forced to confront, sometimes it is being
        allowed, or even enabled/aided to confront)
 
must account - at least in part - for its persistent recurrence
 
        (tho it is also an example of recurrence, a form of recurrence
        a practice organized around recurrence)
 
and for the obsessively recurrent hold this practice has from an early
age on those who go on to spend
 
        (in the most generous senses of the word)
 
their lives on it. And explain our interest in such work of testimony
 
        (for what else sustains the presence of work such as that,
        lets say, of John Wieners, or other poets NOT the subject
        of manufactured conferences)
 
as tends to unique instance of language, a testimony as in Primo Levi
or in Celan, surely not "buried."

Kali Tal wonders why we read poetry which is not "pleasurable."
 
But do we? What is pleasure? (the pleasure of the text, the pleasure of
the senses, the pleasure of the unknown . . .
 
Is language pleasure?  my mouth & ears both believe so, in a fairly
uncomplicated sense    the intellect and emotions, too, but not in any
simple sense at all     and altogether now  (all together now . . .
 
Is content any more pleasure than the lingering physicality of language?
or is it, in part, the same pleasure?

Dear Kali:
     I don't think that anyone reads poetry--and by that I mean *really*
reads it (more than skimming it, or simply noting its presence)--that is
not "pleasurable" in some sense. I think people who say that they do read
(allegedly) "non-pleasurable" poetry actually derive pleasure from doing
that (as well as from thinking/talking/writing about it--"it" being both
the poetry & the act of reading it). A poem may well have been written
with the intention of "writing against" a reader's pleasure, but the
moment one takes that (or anything else the poem brings up directly or
indirectly) into consideration, begins *thinking* about it, one begins
experiencing pleasure...no? Admittedly, my definition of "pleasure" (which
includes thinking, considering--a general term might be
"engagement"--Charles Bernstein, why don't you--or, do you?--consider
*engagement* with a text a kind of absorption?) might be so generalized
and/or inclusive as to be ultimately meaningless.
     Semi-related to this: This idea of "consumerism/ dissemination."
(Can't remember now who brought this up! Please re-identify yourself!) My
sense is that consumerism with respect to *anything* disseminated is
unavoidable. If I send out copies of a poem to three or four friends
(which is what I do with a certain portion of my work), then I and my
three or four friends are engaging in an act of consumerism as well as an
act of dissemination. I have almost a whole bookcase devoted to
manuscripts I've received, some from friends, some from others, & these
are no different to me (in essence) from the "published"  things I've got
on other bookshelves. (The only reason the mss. are separated is because
they're too tall to fit on the other shelves.) I've even written and had
published a *review* of one manuscript someone sent me to read, & plan to
continue doing that when & as possible.
     What is the difference between paying (say) Station Hill to publish
your manuscript and making photocopies of the ms. & sending it out to
friends & others potentially interested in reading it? Or, for that
matter, what's the difference between finding an editor of a small press
to publish your book (including paying for it--& do editors w/out family
money, rich friends, or successful nonprofit orgs *do* that anymore?--not
a rhetorical question, btw)--well, what's the difference between that &
sending your work around, in whatever form?
     As a reader, I have to say I appreciate, even prefer, books w/out
blurbs, blurb-like matter, ISBN numbers, LOC info, bar codes, etc. I have
more respect for "lower key" magazines like _Mirage_, _lower limit
speech_, _Situation_, _North American Ideophonics_, and _Talisman_ than I
do magazines like _Zyzzyva_, _Sulfur_ and _Conjunctions_. (I also tend to
be more interested in the work the former examples publish.) But, I'm also
aware of the notion that you might want to sell a few books or mags,
especially if you're paying production costs. & bookstores these days are
increasingly unwilling to stock books or mags w/out all of the "bullshit."
The books my wife Marta & I publish include all of the "bullshit,"
*despite* my sense that it somehow "cheapens" the things.
Dissemination--almost all of it, at any level--involves some degree of
compromise. It helps, I think, if you can be consistently aware of that,
know beforehand what you are or are not willing to do. If you simply want
the work out there, in whatever form, available for people to read it,
you'll likely be willing to do just about anything to make that happen,
including saying things you don't believe, or (just as bad) withholding
your real thoughts in fear of offending someone who could "fuck up your
career."
     So, while I do think there's no such thing as dissemination free from
consumerism, I don't think consideration of either is pointless. Would
like to see more on this topic, actually.
     Yours,
     Gary

Since the question of what poetry does is a difficult one, I thought it
might be useful to provide you with a writing model to guide your
responses.  So, here is an excerpt from the introduction to Vol 4 of my
groovy new/old Poets of the English Language set:
 
  "What is man? How does he differ from the gods on the one hand and from
nature on the other?  What is the divine element in man? A different set
of answers to such questions, or a shift of emphasis in the old answers,
changes the style and subject matter of poetry and the poet's conception
of his [sic] function.
  For example, in the age of the heroic epic the difference between gods
and men is that the former are immortal and the latter must finally all
die like the beasts.  In the meantime, however, some men are made godlike
and separated from nature by the favor of the gods, becoming heroes
who do great deeds.  The poet, that is, the man inspired with the gift of
tongues, celebrates the hero and his acts.
  In the Middle Ages, the quality which man shares with God and which
the creatures do not have is a will that can make free choices.  What
separates man from god is sin: that he can and does choose wrongly, love
himself, act selfishly.  The function of the poet is to exhibit the
human soul tempted by competing loves, and to celebrate the ways in which
she [sic?] can be redeemed.
  In the neoclassical period, the divine human quality is reason, the
capacity to recognized general laws, and the function of the poet is
to celebrate the Rational City and to pour scorn on its enemies.
  Toward the end of the eighteenth century--Rousseau is one of the first
symptoms--a new answer appears.  The divine element in man is now held to
be neither power nor free will nor reason, but self-consciousness.  Like
God and unlike the rest of nature, man can say "I": his ego stands
over against his self, which to the ego is a part of nature.  In this
self he can see possibilities; he can imagine it and all things as
being other than they are; he runs ahead of himself; he forsees his
own death... [omitted citation of Holderlin's Der Mensch].  If
self-awarenss and the power to conceive of possiblity is the divine
element in man, then the hero whom the poet must celebrate is himself,
for the only possible consciousness accessible to him is his own..."
 
 
That brings us up to the Romantic Period.  With this model before you,
it shld be a relatively easy matter to define the function of poetry
for the modern and contemporary periods in 75 words or less. Additional
points will be awarded for effective deployments of such concepts as
"postmodernism," "pop culture," and the "death of the author."
Points will be deducted for scatalogical puns on the word "function"
(tho' references to "eschatology" are welcome).

Did any of y'all see that egregious piece on the Poetry Scene and

who wrote it reported the "Was that a real poem or did you write it
yourself?" question as having been put to another poet at another time,
post-Creeley -- indicating to me (unless it was the case that the

Subject:      the hallmark of art
 
Art is form extending content. Many greeting cards, by Hallmark and other
corporations, make use of this.
 
"Greeting" comes from a web of roots with a current usage showing at the
surface in Scots dialect, expressing the idea of weeping or lamenting -
mostly loudly. Poems have a range of registers.
 
"Turn that TV down while your sister reads her cards; then, you can have
some cake." A Hallmark is not always a verse; is it?
 
And I would be proud to have written the works of Irving Mills, even when
they don't express my sentiments exactly. "Doo wop doo wop, doo wop doo
wop, doo wah."

Subject:      Mystery Slasher
 
From today's San Francisco Chronicle:
 
Mystery Slasher Gutting Books in South Bay
by Michael Taylor, Chronicle Staff Writer
 
A mysterious literary critic, well versed in poetry, is slicing his way
through libraries in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, chopping out the
contents of volumes of modern poetry.
 
Armed with a razor or matte knife, the unknown slasher has gutted books by
such well-known modern poets as Philip Levine, David Shapiro and Philip
Booth.  The slasher leaves the books' spines and covers on the shelves, but
takes the pages.
 
"Obviously, this is somebody with a problem," said Dave Fishbaugh, director
of library services at West Valley College Library in Saratoga.  "It's the
most outrageous example of book mutilation I've seen."
 
Fishbaugh said that whoever is doing this has cut up about 150 titles at
more than a dozen libraries in Milpitas, Morgan Hill, Palo Alto, Santa
Cruz, San Jose, Los Gatos and other South Bay cities.  No suspect has been
identified.
 
About two-thirds of the books that have been destroyed are out of print,
Fishbaugh said, and are effectively irreplaceable.
 
Fishbaugh and other librarians say the slasher typically cuts out all the
pages and then replaces the book on the shelf.  The first case of vandalism
was discovered at the end of January at Foothill College in Los Altos
Hills.
 
"One of our shelvers-that's a person who puts books back on shelves--came
to us and was very alarmed at finding a stack of covers and spines on the
shelves," said Karen Gillette, Foothill's public services librarian.
 
"The books were gutted and then put back on the shelves, but they weren't
in the right place.  That's how we found out about this."
 
In addition to cutting up books, the slasher also carved up three years'
worth of a monthly publication called Poetry Magazine.
 
So far, library officials have no motive for the vandalism.  Some
librarians think the slasher may want to steal the verse without triggering
alarm systems that work off magnetic codes in book spines.  Others think
the thief may be scanning the poetry pages into a computer and creating a
home-made poetry database.
 
Poets whose works were mutilated were perplexed and frightened.  One
hesitated to talk, thinking the slasher might cut up more of his books.
Another said the culprit might be jealous over being rejected for a poetry
anthology.
 
In Castine, Maine, poet Philip Booth-who had some of his nine books slashed
at Foothill College-said, "It certainly seems strange to me that a reader
of poetry would do this.  If this person is going around the country doing
this-hitting Levine and me in every collection-than maybe someday Philip
Levine and I ought to check and see if there's someone in our deep past who
is common to both of us."
 
At Poetry Magazine in Chicago, managing editor Helen Klaviter said, "The
poetry world attracts people on the fringes, and one can never tell exactly
what's going to happen.  It could be someone who's not getting published or
someone who disagrees with the way these people write.  Maybe this person
thinks these poems should be in a different style or form, or wants them to
rhyme."
 
Asked how she felt about somebody slashing up her magazine, Klaviter said,
"I'm floored, I'm speechless.  But part of me is very grateful that it's my
magazine that's being cut up and not me."

I want  to than Wynston Curnow (hope I got that right), cris cheek, and
especially Karlyn Y-Mae Koh for their posts.  Koh's post said all I could
have hoped to have said on the matter and would defer to her on this
matter--particularly as she articulates what it is I could only vaguely
allude to with words like "MORAL" and "RESPONSIBILITY."  I meant to be
somewhat provocative with them and hoped to avoid being seen as
advocating a role of Teacher/Prof as source of info into which it is
poured into the student--accompanied by all the power/authority relations
therein.  My primary motivation--well-intentioned I assure you--was to
confront what I see around me in teachers/profs of an attitude of
cynicism about the endeavor they are engaged in.  If (and this is not
directed at any one in particular) teaching and, especially, "teaching"
literature is only about making a living (or other narrow purpose) it
would seem to me to be a major injustice not only to self but student.
Quite simply, "teaching" (and I prefer shared inquiry") is and should be
political--but political precisely to the extent that it challenges the
process that produces what Koh refers to as clones.  And, further,
political to the extent that power/authority in the classroom is shared.
These are vague remarks, but I hope their imperatives are clear:
responsibility is not ... domination; and moral is not my values are
better than  your's.

Dear Wystan,
 
Just to say (and in case this seems like just a personal, best backchannelled,
NZ chat, I hope others might have seen some of addressing of the teaching
issues we've all been discussing, in this discussion of a specific case),
that I appreciated your witty "I who have destroyed the best minds of
my generation", laughed aloud, in fact, and I appreciate the openness to
discussion. I wasn't, in fact, attacking you personally at all, nor any
of the persons I mentioned; as I said, I think you do do a really good
thing. I was just saying the whole system you and I work in could be
better, and perhaps "corruption" was an overly melodramatic word for
"missed chances", and the fact that it always galls when it appears that
someone one's own age is being preferred, either for classroom attention
or publication, because they have honed themselves into a perfect disciple
(which is always flattering for a teacher, and it remains, perhaps, the
teacher's greatest responsibility to resist it), when their discipleship
ultimately fossilises the past (reflecting on what was good about the
teacher and his/her favourites) and doesn't release the present (the potential
combination in the student of all the things she/he thinks will impress and
all the other things she/he is editing out of her/himself). This is a complex
issue, since sometimes it is the best thing one can do with one's life to
insist on the greater relevance of a neglected past writer over all the
writers currently living, eg the rehabilitation of Stein in the eighties. But
such a sacrifice is often not what's involved in the teacher/student "missed
chances" I'm describing, and usually happens precisely because there is no
teacher to impress with one's passion from the past. One might see in this
tortuous bad description of mine a way of explaining one kind of inheritance
of a national or indigenous experimental or otherwise tradition, and what can
go wrong with it. I really think that one of the very best young poets of
New Zealand is a Wellingtonian called Max Anderson, who had three poems a
few years ago in Landfall, and who I tried to encourage, as a friend not
a teacher; as soon as I left Wellington, he gave up poetry completely, and
moved to London, pretty much wholly out of lack of encouragment. He was
into John Ashbery, Thom Gunn and Allen Curnow, and his own work was just
wonderful, but he kept getting told he was too British, despite that being
a third of his total influence. And of course in Britain he's not going to
start up again, because he keeps getting told he's too kiwi. So it's not
you in particular I'm attacking, because it's a kind of pack behaviour that
is common all over - I could give examples from this university too, of a
student who was the best pop culture theorist, taught me buckets, but who
got discouraged and downgraded solely for his choice of subject matter and
theoretical bearing (the equivalent of influence for a poet?), and is now
a bitter and spiteful man -as he couldn't get funding to continue research
without good grades. So what I mean by "corrupt" is exactly what Alan means
by corruption in the mainstream, kneejerk phobias and pack behaviour, with
really talented individuals discouraged over people who can recite back the
formulae but, since they never had to do the work you yourself did (and I
love Cancer Daybook!) to set your own bearings. What a lot of avant-gardists
think they're doing, in my experience, is trying to make it easier for the
kind of rebel they were when younger, but they in fact don't. But I hope
this isn't perceived as a monochromatic attack, just some reservations and
criticisms; as i said before, the Auckland library collection is great, and
was vital in my own researches and (exhausting, as yet undefeated) attempt
to make my own way.
 
Best,
 
Ira

The crunch of this question as Kali Tal has focussed it lies in:
 
>work [which] forces us to confront events-in-the-world and allows no retreat,
>>no relief.
 
There are multiple ways through which poetry 'allows no retreat, no relief'.
But here I feel disadvantaged as, being a limey, I've no idea what Hallmark
cards really project.
Am I right in thinking that they contain pretty much cliche sentiments to
suit 'occasions of passage' or just express goodwill messages in ahandy
'off the peg' fashion?
 
            'The President would like to say
            She hopes that you have a nice day'
 
If I'm generally at least in the environs of the Hallmark Ballpark then
aren't these poetries intended to offer at the least 'relief' if not
necessarily 'retreat'?
 
I'll stop there, in case I'm way off with my projected assumptions re Hallmark.
Anybody help me out?

Cris, I think you're dead on. The problem as I see it of Hallmark cards and
other such genres (I can't think of anything else to call it) is that their
primary function seems to be affirmative. Things aren't as bad as they seem,
in fact they are pretty darn good. This is not a problem only related to
Hallmark but kid's cartoons (care bears;barney) and sitcoms (where Johnny's
anti-social acting out by throwing water balloons off the balcony are
resolved when dear old dad turns the hose on his) and talk shows (have
a problem with incest, let the expert andthe audience help you!).
     The function of all of these is to provide pseudo-solutions.
This isn't to say that there is not he possibility of finding accurate
criticism in these. Beavis and Butthead can be quite critical, and Oprah
and Salt and Pepa have provided forums for issues most of us would like to
suppress as deeply as possible. But it would be a mistake as I see it to
forget their primary purpose which seems clearly to me to reassure.
     Thanks, Eric.

Maybe the problems we've all been addressing, that of teaching, and
what poetry does, can be said to be problems of mastery. Which is
how we avoid the "bad faith of the professor," or the assumption
that all can be known about anything. Whether we are teaching or
writing, thinking can never stop; you can't ever pretend you
got it all down. WHich means sometimes that our students know
more than us, in moreways than one.Which means when we are
writing, its not always us who is writing, eh?
     Some thoughts, Eric.

>>fact don't.
Posted listwards as there are some general issues here although one or two
of the characters are probably anglo-specific.
 
Ira are you only a rebel when you're younger  -  have you seen the Tony
Hancock movie 'The Rebel'? I'm uncertain as to the applicability of terms
such as avant-garde and rebel these days. I'm curious as to what you're
suggesting  - if you have a positive suggestion in respect of what you
appear to articulate as an impasse for teachers as well as peers. Or are we
caught in the hoollowed walls of academe here?
 
1.   I remember Jeff Nuttall once telling me of how, when he was Head of
Department at Liverpool School of Art (or close) there were many students
who had astounding facility with a line (drawing)  -  they could, in his
sense, make a line do whatever they wanted. These were, in his view, highly
skilled draughtspeople. BUT, he said, the ones with the 'natural born
talent' (almost a saleable film title there I think) were often not those
who went on to become 'professional artists'. Maybe, you could say, they
just had more sense. But his point was that the people who became artists
were those who 'wanted' to become artists and who pursued that  -  .
 
2.   Eric Mottram was one of the poets with whom I made initial contact as
a young, nineteen year old (sort of average undergraduate age) would-be
poet. I learned a great deal from him and yet he was downright discouraging
to my work for about two or three years. He was a useful poet to develop
resistances against.
 
3.   Poets who actively encouraged and promoted my emergent practices at
that time, Bob Cobbing, Allen Fisher, Ulli Freer among others I considered
to be both 'teachers' and 'peers'  -  although admittedly I never felt
myself to be in a formalised teacher-pupil relationship with them. It would
be my contention that anybody who enters the institutionalised education
system (thereby syllabus, curriculum and government ideology) deserves
everything that they get  -  and I say this as somebody who is now twenty
years later enrolled as a student and bugging the hell out of my own
'teachers'.
 
4.   This whole confrontation of being perceived and buttoned as too 'kiwi'
or 'brit' and so on astonishes me. I find it difficult (i know I find
everything difficult) to understand how anyone can take criticism
articulated on such a basis with anything other than the utter contempt it
deserves. At the very least such resistances should be sufficient
encouragement.
 
5.    The desire for repetition (to hideously paraphrase Deleuze and
Guattari) is the beginnings of the recognition of a need to mutate. The
actual citation reads:
'Repetition is not the law, the finality of something; on the contrary, it
marks the [I would say 'a'] threshold to "deterritorialization", the
indication of a desiring mutation.'
 
Seems like this begins to propose an approach to the question Why Teach?
 
6.    I do recognise the pack or clique behaviour you mention, the
potential claustrophobia of prevalent 'taste' (the 'canon' of any
consensual given moment)  -  happens again and again, particularly among
male poets propping up the bar around reading series' notable for 'almost'
cover to cover beefcake programming.

Subject:      someone gets a kick out of hallmark texts
 
people who read work of the`confront-events-in-the-world-&-allows-no-retreat-&-no-relief' type do
so either because it makes them feel good [aesthetically or ethically or both]
or because they are forced by others. The latter case includes people who are
majoring in 'english' (as a nonforeign language?) & must read that type of work when it is
'required reading' whether or not it makes them feel good.
 
Not being able to retreat or experiencing relief (even thinking of those
situations) makes me feel bad, so i always want to find out which works fall into the
no-retreat/no-relief category so I can avoid them.
 
i am convinced that hallmark poetry belongs in the no retreat/no
relief category. Many times it makes you confront events in the world (e.g.
birth, death) and there is no retreat & no relief from sending or receiving
them.

Dear Eric Pape,
         How about going further.  Students know lots, but poets,
painters, musicians also know things.  So who teaches who is an
interesting question.  "I am teaching Michelangelo to-day" should
read I'm finding out what looking at X or Y or Z  by Michelangelo has
got to offer?   Ergo,"Michelangelo teaches me"?  Or you-name-it
teaches.  This is a problem of positioning of the subjects, -- whose
roles in the class room are defined as teachers and students.
Teaching is gross when it gets to be indoctrination, isn't that the
issue?

A question to those who run the list -- it seemed to me that while we
were discussing whether or not to break the list up into different
categories in order to reduce the amount of mail and produce more focused
discussions, you've also much expanded the list in terms of numbers,

With regard to the subject of teaching and writing:  In an APR interview
from 1989, Donald Hall stated that he deplored the separation of
creative writing programs from the teaching of literature (to grads
or undergrads) because:
 
"If you teach great literature you live among the great models.  You
make your living reading Moore and Pound and Hardy and Marvell and
Yeats! Incredible.  Students ask you questions, and when you answer
you discover that you knew something you didn't know you knew.  Instead
of living with half-baked first drafts by narcissistic teenagers [in
workshop classes], you live with the _greatest art_.  What could be a
better way to spend your spare time--when you're not competing
directly with Wordsworth--than be reading Wordsworth."
 
Other than the fact that I find teaching to be more than a "spare
time" activity (if it's done well), I find Hall's rationale for the
presence of the poet in the English department quite reassuring.

Yes, Ryan, anyone, in so far as the text consists of simply readily
available words for numbes and a well-known conjunction.  But only at
a given place in a given situation would anyone think that that was a
poem, for Pete's sake!  Is that what you are saying?  Do you read
Thierry de Duve, whose intricate and rich meditations on this
problem occur in English in "Pictorial Nominalism".  Ready-made are
the words, but their positioning, that's something else.

 Hi Al!  Welcome to see you here.  In your post last Friday you said
something which I've puzzled over, but haven't gotten clear:  that DC
poets "try to render the problematics and language and representation as
literally as possible."  I'm not sure I have much stake in the question,
since I'm a resident of Arlington VA, but what =is= a literal rendition of
the problematics of language and representation?   Maybe you're
suggesting that DC poets, close to the realities of political action,
sense they need to be more straightforward in order to have an impact in
the world?  That's an interesting idea, and may be true of many poets
around here (but not perhaps so true of those DC poets I know who are
actually on this list).  But I think I just failed to catch the sense you
intended to convey.
 
As for the LC readings, I wonder if you're representing the situation
around here accurately -- it's true that most of the readings are held at
6:45 pm, instead of 8 pm.  The announced logic for this change (which
still corresponds to the closing-for-repairs of the grand Coolidge
Auditorium in the old, main Jefferson building of the Library) is that
now people who want to attend after work before going home may do so.
Apparently it was felt that people wouldn't come back to town, because of
the logistics involved in commuting.  And most folks who work in the
District who have any interest in attending the kinds of readings
sponsored by the L.C. face at least some commute, even if only to outer
areas of the District.  I guess I don't see how a 6:45 reading precludes
DC residents from attending the readings.  Of course someone may be
worried that some people would be reluctant to come to "dangerous"
Capitol Hill so late as 8 pm at night, and there would doubtless be some
racism involved in such a hypothesis; but 6:45 is nighttime around here
during a significant part of the poetry season anyway, and even the 6:45
readings don't get finished till close to 9 pm, cetainly dark during the
spring and fall portions of the LC schedule.
 
I don't know why we have a poet laureate -- I should say, I don't think
we ever should have had to employ that honorific title.  But lots of the
Consultants in Poetry, like the current Laureates, kept their residences
elsewhere.  Some did spend a lot of time here in DC, and were locally
admired for it.  But the truth is the gig doesn't pay that well -- last I
heard it was maybe $20K-- but that's just a rumor whose truth I can't
verify.  Not much to live on here in DC -- though OBVIOUSLY more than
many poor folks here have to survive on somehow.  But if Rita Dove wants
to spend a lot of time in Charlottesville, two hours away, that doesn't
seem horrific to me.

Yes this is the question but I'm not sure if that is what I'm saying.
In fact, I only posed a question.  But I don't know if I agree that
"ONLY at a given place in a given situation " do words become poems.
I whole-heartedly endorse found poetry: too much rhymes when you
mind your prospects.  And no I haven't read "Pictorial Nominalism".
Should I?

Dear Ryan,
 
         Reading could speed up discussion of the "ready-made"
aspect, [not that speed is everything].  And the situation in
question in the Creeley poem you introduced in here supposes
a cultural situation in which that particular "piece" comes to be
interesting, as much as anything for its seeming simplicity, and
consequent confusion of the field of "what poetry is".
 
It still has that effect, I guess.   Anyways, Thierry de Duve is a
good read.  I offer that as a recommendation of something pleasant
and interesting for someone who raises the interesting questions you
ask (not as some awful academic Duty.)
 
Cheers.

I like what Gary Sullivan said to Kali. I know he was talking about
reading for enjoyment but the message hits me in the following way.
 
Political statements can be poetry or propoganda or both. Propoganda can
be the truth in a political context. But if it is poetry, the residue
that is left will be regarded more for its aesthetic content than its
political. Because politics has a way of being current and art has a way
of being eternal or out of time.
 
Some artists or poets or whatever get to their essence by virtue
of their politics and others stand outside it. I think someone like Joyce
stood outside it but dealt with it continually. Someone like Virginia
Woolf had to deal with it more directly, or maybe more personally,
because she had a stake in changing a system she considered an injustice
to herself and other women. Joyce didn't need to deal with that basic issue.
All he needed to do was prove he was the greatest writer of the English
language since Shakespeare!
 
Someone like Gertrude Stein, who I studied pretty heavily my 1st year of
college and who gave me my lead into the world of visual arts, got around
the women's issue by identifying with men as a man. However she looked
down on women for the most part. Virginia Woolf liked women, she held on
to that in her writing. It seems to me she is a woman writer. Gertrude Stein
wasn't really gender oriented in her writing. I like her audacity,
her assurance and her love of artists and writers.
 
Then I think their are people who live what might be called poetic lives.
In a large sense people like Malcolm X and Nelson Mandela are such
people.

Subject:      Pop will eat itself (fwd)
 
I've been lurking and mulling this whole thing over for a couple of
days.  I've always been a fan of Popism, Warhol has been my hero since I
was a preteen.  Howver I've  never been a fan of Hallmark (I like far side
cards) but I do see its place in the Forrest Gumpville, USA  that has become
ever so annoying and popular.
        But packaging and selling that warm fuzzy feeling is an aspect of
Western culture that i look at as a very precise art form.  HAllmark has
to be given credit for that atleast.  Playing off our guilt enough to
convince us that Secretary's Day is viable holiday is pretty impressive.
        I think the reason we can't swallow Hallmark as art is because it
masquarades itself as true sentiment.  It's sells love and apologies.
It prostitutes what is supposed to be near and dear for $2.50 and seals
it in a red envelope.  Another amazing and similar consumer frenzy is
going on in the long distance phone business, yet we aren't quite as
threatened by that surge simply because it doesn't come to us in the form of
verse.
        Idon't know I'm sort of babbling, but Hallmark is Hallmark and
poetry is .  .  . well I don't know, but I do agree with Warhol, i like
my art with mistakes.  The canvas never looks right unless it has streaks
and smudges, that's how you tell its authentic.
 
                Lindz Williamson
 
 
What I'd like to know is what is with the revial of the Western?
I've noticed three definite themes reappearing in poetry, fiction and film
using the western genre.
1) The wise old Indian stereo type, return to nature and the mother earth
spirit.
2( The independent I am a cow girl so don't mess with me female
empowerment in the Wild West, yet I will throw myself down to the one man
that can tame me.
3)And finally the its ok white boy your not all that bad, not all of you
are blood sucking colonialists, some of you can read keats and castrate a
bull all in a days work.
 
Can anyone give me any insight?

I really like the idea of Hallmark as propaganda.  It's a secure medium

          URGENT     ACTION ALERT     URGENT
 
      SENATE BEGINS DEBATE ON THE PROPOSED FY 95 RESCISSIONS
 
                GRASSROOTS CONTACTS NEEDED
 
 
 ISSUE:  The Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by Senator Mark
Hatfield (R-OR), just announced that it will consider the FY 95
rescission package this Friday, March 24, with floor consideration
anticipated as early as next week.  Like the House bill, which passed
last week, the Senate proposal is expected to contain $17 billion in
spending cuts -- over $5 billion to pay for California emergency aid and
$11 billion for deficit reduction. The House bill also contains a $5
million cut to both the NEA and NEH. (The House NEA cuts are targeted:
$1 million from its administrative budget and $4 million from
unobligated program funds, most of which is directed at individual
fellowships.)
 
      Last week, arts advocates scored a victory when the House
defeated, by a vote of 260 to 168, an amendment that would have tripled
the NEA funding reduction in the House bill from $5 to $15 million.
Defeat of the NEA amendment is significant because sponsors Phil Crane
(R-IL) and Cliff Stearns (R-FL) implored conservative House Democrats
and Republicans to support deeper cuts in the NEA's budget.
 
 SENATE ACTION NEEDED:  To register broad based support for cultural
funding, we need you to get in touch with your Senators and urge them to
oppose any funding reductions to the NEA and NEH.  WE URGE YOU TO CALL
YOUR SENATORS BY FRIDAY MORNING, MARCH 24.  Express your opposition to
NEA funding cuts by using the sample message below.  The congressional
switchboard number is (202) 224-3121.
 
                          SAMPLE MESSAGE
 
      The Senate soon will be considering a rescission package to this
year's (FY 95) budget.  Please oppose any attempt to cut NEA and NEH
funding.
 
The NEA already has suffered budget cuts over the past several years.
In fact, the NEA's budget has lost nearly 50 percent of its purchasing
power over the past 15 years.  The agency is playing its part in deficit
reduction.
 
      Such cuts have limited the agency's ability to serve the American
 public.  Both the NEA and the NEH are wise investments that merit
national support.  These cultural agencies help your constituents.
These agencies' investments help generate jobs, create a competitive
labor force for the future, revitalize communities, improve education,
enhance tax bases and stimulate economic growth, increase tourism, and
improve the development and growth of auxiliary services.

Q:  What's the difference between a good langpo
    and a tree?
 
A1: Nothing.
A2: Everything.
A3: The Answer, like the Question, is beside the point.
A4: The tree, unlike the langpo, isn't preoccupied with
    defining its position. It occupies it.
 
Take your pick. I like A4 (& not just cause it's longer).
Does theorize mean think about or write about what
you think about - or maybe do these things in specific
contexts or forums - as per this LIST.
 
If I ask, what makes me feel welcome here, what's my
qualification being here (apart from the gender
and de-lurker invitations, which are lovely and
help), I'd say it's cos I'm interested in intellectual
discussion, specifically langpo-type speculations.
This of course means I like the company, very much,
even if I don't know the quality of your social or other
lives.  Right now, don't care.
 
So, it's a kind of community - I mean, there are
commonnesses operating huh, of interests, of reading,
of a pleasure in theorizing. Of stimulation and the
pleasure - yeah maybe power too - of expression.
 
Poetry and its theorizing I think don't have social
or political or what have you functions.  Maybe the sense
of responsibility
comes from the feeling that we owe our patrons, now
that our patrons/the market are in good part the
state, hence society.
 
I mean, it's opportunity and proclivity that connects
us. What are the personal costs agains the pleasure of
being on the LIST - does it come down to being a
university-sponsored, mail- (oops, male-) dominated
thing.
 
The loop that leads back from such theory to its
sponsoring society must necessarily get mediated beyond
recognition,
it's dishonest to claim responsibility for ourselves.
At most, such responsibility is an indirect thng.
 
Now maybe it's the processes of mediation running too & from
langpo and its theorizers, job appointments, books
published, conferences, earnings, what have you.  But
theory has to do with what it theorizes, in this case
literary stuff (&itself).
 
It seems to me typically literature doesn't do well
patronizing the patron.
 
 
By the way, Tony, with the place you give sound/voice in
poems where do you leave someone who just happens not to
have heard poetry aloud, or a deaf someone.  I can't
see the disadvantage.
Surely one sensitivity being blocked serves well to
open others?

(oops just sent off the wrong post, bloody unix
system, sent this one friday w/o success, here goes again..)
 
Hi Alan, Wystan, Tony (especially)..
 
Got to say I feel supportive of Alan's Stafford
rebuttal - same time can I push at the side of
it rather than just forming a scrum with you guys.
 
I'd like to speak as a friend and someone with aligned
writing intersts.
 
I'm uncomfortable with indignation as a form of
literary address.  I think it already assumes a mandate
and is too affordable. It knows better than what it
addresses.  I can't see the writers involved haven't fully
adequate resources available. Alan, Wystan, Michele, Murray, Tony, Roger,
Alex, all teach at AUckland University.  All have
texts published, most by reputable publishers.  AUP recently
published Michele, Murray, Alan. All the writers
above have been involved in editing NZ literary
magazines - Parallax, And, Splash. I've seen good
serious reviews of all writers. I reviewed Alan I
think appreciatively in Landfall. You guys - we
guys - have surely been given some chances and taken
many more.
 
Marginalism is as much self-induced as conferred,
surely. How do Wystan's demolition job on modernism
(in Parallax) and Alan's on CK Stead (in Island)
differ from any other attempt to get the high ground?
We've gone harder at discrediting other literary
practices, at least as hard, I think, as they us.
 
I'm saying these things cause I'm currently writing
on NZ literary practice/s. Also, cause this is something
I've talked/mailed about with Wystan and Alan. Also, cause
I submitted a proposal for public funding in early '93 for
a magazine which involved most of the names above (yes, that
was turned down, and wrongly I believe - another story).
 
Also, I've been writing poetry in and out of this group
over several years and while I've felt tremendous
personal support it has not been (for me) an endorsement
of my achievement as such. How such endorsements work
is subtle and of course often sensitive.  My books have
been self-published and hand-sold.  They've been read in
public and sometimes reviewed.  A brief postcard I received
from Charles Bernstein after sending him a copy of Itsan
meant maybe more than other responses I got. People
support what they like (and what likes them too, which
is natural), I like my work so who should I ask to
write seriously about it? My sense is, of the people I've
mentioned, maybe Tony has had least mainstream
recognition of his work/s? Would you care to comment
on your experience visavis the mainstream, Tony?
 
Who's allowed to complain, who's allowed to insist on
being read let alone read a certain way?  I don't think
the values appealed to in the name of poetry have
and superior merit. In fact, the ethical dimension
of writing as it stands is, I believe, illshaped and outdated.
Charles and I both say Alan's a 'terrific' poet: in
our game, how does one weigh the sayer with the said?
 
So, I support Alan but I don't go with the dialectic
it espouses.  It's too proper an idea of writing and
writing's public for me. I place this response here because
I'm interested in literary practices and want to say
something personal, as a friend and fellow writer,
from Japan, thru a computer based in Buffalo (where?)
across the screens of a no. of Americans and others
(what would hold them to read this far?) to my

a book i'm always ready to recommend: Richard Slotkin's _Regeneration
Through Violence_, on the ambivalent american relationship to nature/
wilderness/"savage", and its expression in AmLit.  also, Annette
Kolodny's _Lay of the Land_, w/ a feminist analysis of some of the
same issues...

Subject:      Wot Dey Doo
 
        Discussion here has come to an interesting pass--
step back, observe the weave of many threads:
 
        One set of voices asks what poems/pages/teachers/students/
greetingcards/cowboymovies can/may/should/must do.  Literally:
"what's the use?"  The correct answer to these, taken together, is
"many things: too many to count on the off-hand."
This is a vague answer, thus not very popular in academe.  Too bad.
Many here voice this position, at least by implication, to which
chorus I add my own.  I won't tell poets what to do.  And I have found,
sadly, that academic description all too often turns into prescription.
(I have no such compunction, though, against telling critics what to do
or where to go.)
 
        But another set of voices, which shares some membership with the
first set, answers according to academic habit by specifying one
or a few possible uses as if those few were the only correct
or worthy ones.  Another, only slightly better way of doing this is to
rank the potential uses on a seemingly vertical scale, high
as opposed to low (and "cultural studies"' bouleversement of that scale
does nothing to remedy the fundamental authority problem inherent
in academic habitude--a rank order turned upside-down is,
as has been observed by others here, still a rank order and still
dependent upon the criteria that ranked the *old* order).
 
        Walk to the front of a classroom and you walk into a role
in the imaginary drama each student writes for you--that is, ten, twenty,
fifty different roles at once.  You'd better believe you're not always
going to play the good-guy.  Regard yourself as a co-investigator and
soon you'll be sued by students who believe they're paying good
money to have facts force-fed to them; go the opposite way and you're
unjust toward those who would have thriven on co-operation.  Sorry: no
amount of tips can help you totalize this one.  But it's okay.  Some
of my best teachers were my worst ones: the ones who motivated me to
show that bastard a thing or two.  Happens all the time.  You cannot
control the student's reception of your efforts by applying some
particular technique.  You (we) can, however, try to respond openly
and flexibly to the multiplicity of students' wants and needs. (Again
vague, this is as precise a formulation as the problem affords.)
 
        Political responsibility does not amount to
either going along with or else opposing a cultural hegemony.  It amounts
to exercising one's share of power in group decision-making: far more
of a gray (grey, for you Kiwis) area than the either/or of hegemony theory.
I don't use greeting cards because I would consider it lazy *for me* to do
so, not necessarily for my neighbor.  (I also think Hallmark markets their
product in an unethical way by inventing occasions on which my friends and
relatives will feel hurt if I don't plunk down my couple of bucks on the
right sort of card, but this has nothing to do with the verses per se.)  The
sentiments they express can support, oppose, or take any number of more
complex positions toward "the culture."  Generally the funny ones ironize
our common problems, which can assuage bad faith or spur good faith efforts
to change things; once again, the effect is not and cannot be totally
controlled.  And that's a good thing.

Now that Kato's tesitmony has been interrupted for the day, I want to
respond quickly to a number of disparate postings:
 
Help?  Bob Kaufman's poem "The American Sun" includes a ref. to "Arthur
Farnsworth Television."  Haven't been able to ID this -- Can anybody tell
me who Arthur Farnsworth is/was?  Maria or any other Kauman readers??
 
I'd hate to see such a binary opposition as Olson v Cultural Studies gain
currency. Some of you may recall the amusing episode in Olson studies
when his ref. to "Durante" was misread till somebody wrote in to the
Olson journal to point out the obvious, that Olson's ref. was to the
Schnoz himself.  I don't happen to find Hallmark verse engaging myself,
but it is certainly an interesting cultural phenomenon -- And how will we
write those pesky Norton Anthology footnotes if we don't know about this
stuff?
 
Now, in answer to David MacAleavey (who others on the POETICS line will
not know was one of my dissertation readers long ago).
 
Will have to give you a fuller reponse elsewhere, as I'm on a machine
that does not belong to me this week (one that makes it nearly impossible
to correct anything!) -- but quickly --
as to point one -- cf, maybe "Can the Subaltern Speak" and _What Comes
After The Subject_ --
as to the other points (don't have the posting [or posstage] in front of
me] -- Well, yes, I will admit to hyperbole (this will hardly surprise
you) -- but I suspect that the rationale you mention for the change in
reading schedules at the Library of Congress, that people could attend on
their way home from work, is the sort of thing that seems sensible to a
group of people meeting on the Hill before going home to the suburbs.  I
am prepared to find that I am horribly wrong about that -- I imagine that
rationale might hold true for the early shift at the Government Printing
Office, but I doubt that this move has demonstrably increased the
participation of DC residents in the series.  And no, there's nothing
particularly horrific in Rita Dove's decision to live at home in C'Ville
with her family & near her tenured position -- Things are a bit different
(though still not horrific) when the poet lives, say, in a noncontiguous
state & makes a point of repeating slighting remarks about the local
literary culture to the national press.  (For those not familiar with the
odd history of such things, one quickly learns not to make predictions
about the matter based on the published verse.  William Meredith (who
comes in for brutal treatment in an Olson poem) was one of the LOC Poetry
Consultants most supportive of area poets.
 
& No, I see no reason for us to have a Poet Laureate either,,, but I see
that as no bar to my interpreting the remarks of  Brodsky, Strand and a
few others as somewhat shortsighted --  This is in the nature of a
symptomatic reading -- We can judge Professor Newt by his first
appointment of a House historian, and I think we can derive lessons about
governmental attitudes towards the literary arts from the history of the
LOC --
 
anyway, as the unmatched parentheses above confirm, I can't backtrack on
this compture to correct anything, and so will speak more directly of
these things in person -- will be there in June!  Good to hear from you
after all these years.
 
Now, my additions to our group reading lists:
_Dictee_  by Theresa Hak-Kyung Cha -- just reissued by 3d Woman Press &
available through SPD -- this one is a must!
 
& from the land of the still out of print --
_Dunford's Travels Everywhere_ by William Melvin Kelley -- a real
surprise -- check your local university library for a copy.
 
Lastly, I don't know why the list of participants was expanded without
comment, but I will confess to having added myself to the list without
comment -- Sorry -- I don't know what came over me --

Subject:      The List Itself
 
Sandra Braman asks about any increase in the number of people on this list.
As of today, there are 200 subscribers to Poetics.  So, yes, the list grows by
a few people every week.
      The policy on new subscribers has remained the same all along, and there
are no plans to change it: the list is private, but anyone who finds out about
it (usually through another list member but also through discovering the list
by browsing EPC) is free to subscribe.  I continue to see the advantage of
keeping the list to a smallish scale, but then I don't know what smallish
means in an environment as big as the internet.  (In a talk on Friday, at UB's
conference on the internet and related issues, Loss Glazier quoted some
remarkable statistics on the day by day growth of the internet; perhaps he
will post those here.)
      The paradox is that in an attempt to be open and nonexcluding one can
end up excluding those who are unable to handle the volume: people are drowned
out rather than kept out -- until Dreamworks Interactive, Inc., guides us and
we asphyxiate.
      If people on the list have thoughts about this, please let me\us know.
 
**
 
A reminder that if your server is down or your "disk quota" is exceeded you
may find yourself automatically unsubbed from Poetics; should this happen,
just resubscribe yourself.
      Some subscribers have changed their user IDs, often from initials or
numerals to full names; the listserv program evidently can't recognize the old
and new addresses as the same and this may cause difficulties in setting
options, unsubscribing, and posting.  If you do change your ID, unsub with the
old and resub with the new (?!).
      If you want to temporarily stop getting Poetics mail it may be easier to
send a message to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu: set poetics nomail    & later:
set poetics mail    than unsubbing and resubbing.
      If you get the Digest: if possible, try to send any replies to the list
without using the "reply" function so that you can write in a specific subject
head; otherwise the subject reads "Digest".
      On my vax system, the only information I have about a message from the
directory is that it is from Poetics, the date, and the subject; other
systems, as I understand it, give more or different information.
      There is some snare in the "automated" archiving of Poetics files, so
that we don't have monthly compilations for the last three months.  I have
requested that this be fixed and hope it soon will be.
 
**
Once again, let me encourage those of you out there who edit magazines or
publish books to send information to the list on new publications as well as
complete backlists.  Also welcome: information on new and recent books and
publications by list participants (I have been tempted to put together a
recommended reading list just of recent books and publications by people on
this list, many of which have not been cited here, but the job is too
extensive for me just now.)

my little insulite pad.
 
 
The prairie gives off long
when we roam.  You built
a fire to warm our socks.
Grateful night critters
blinked at the shadows.
The buttes got mangy.
 
 
Your horse sense
kept you away from
the strip mining

nuggets in the pan
at Trinity Center.
The mountain folk
didn't no ways
stand you off.
Your pockets

of gold.
 
 
 
Barkeep, take my gun
for safekeeping.
I wish to bathe
the trained longing
of my whipper snapper.
 
 
I played with the fur
trappers while you
were on the trail.
I struck it up
with one of the lonely
girls from Abilene.
She spoke highly
of your playing habits.
 
 
 
I want to crouch around
your merry mack.
Zoom Zoom
says the rider.
 
 
My strums are for you,
saloon girl.  Fanciful
flouncing is your game.
I reckon only your
bosom is level headed.
Give me a kiss
before high noon.
 
 
The cook returns
the ladle to the chuck
wagon.  O friendly
ground, tonight you'll
substitute for my lover.
 
 
The gray puffy clouds
roll in the afternoon.
We don't yield as much
to the gracious outline
of the sun.  I've seen you
holding the rifles.  You
learned about animal sex
from hunting.  You can
empty shells.
 
 
 
Our horses break
the sod.  Buzzards
circle the roundup.
I wear a Stetson
in Kansas City
to impress you.
This is how I go
about courting.
 
 
The paper fan
delivers sweet air
to the back of your neck,
my angel.  Your cowboy
wings fan the drafts
of the Southwest.  I
present to you my
newly-oiled chamber.
Are you ready for
the back country
of my love.
 
 
 
You continuously build
such campfires.  And you
announce your greed.  I am
 all tied up by your silks.
The big night pretends
to put it out.
 
 
You wear a leather mantle
against the dust.  You make
coffee in the morning.
You make the range
a reflection in your
golden spurs.  Please draw
that six and squeeze me
off a few rounds.
 
 
You can leave
your chaps on,
partner.  But that
gunbelt is in the way.
The rifleman
is a strong emotion.
 
 
 
We left shotgun
pellets behind us.
We left groves
of trees wondering.
We left coyotes
trying to join
our love yelps.
You old horny toad,
wait till after
I cook up the rabbit
on a spit.
 
 
To stay up with the moon
and you and tequila.  I kept
feeding the fire.
The corona broke
and we saw the sage.
You said you saw
everything.  Wolves
were howling.
 
 
 
Remember the buffalo
bread you baked?  I've
never met a better baker.
You sure can shoot, too
and throw a steer
on its side at the rodeo.
 
 
 
We needed to water
the horses.  You sniffed
it out.  The leaves
stroked the water
in its hidden places.
The animals drank.
 
 
 
The creatures don't protest
our take over of this spot.
Not if we deal them in,
the cicadas, the prairie
skeeters and the vast
distance of it all.
 
 
 
My bedroll is wet
with morning dew.
I must find my breakfast.
Nuts and berries are
plentiful, but the brush
is rustling with
animal sound.
 
 
I started cooking
over the fire.  I put
in a few irons too.
I may do some
touch-up branding
of your rustled cattle.
 
 
Sing me a song about the range,
my love.  I've heard a few
sad ones about the Big Valley
and the Grand Canyon.
Please, seduce me again
with your sad songs.
 
 
 
You panned for gold
in Placerville.  Do you
still have that burning
pain?  I know what
happened in the mining
accident wasn't my fault.
I turned on the high-
pressure hose out of love.
 
 
 
I would be careful
of that branding iron
if I were you, in your 501s
and sheepskin collar
jean jacket.  The irons
are hot now.  They'll
be blackened any minute.
 
 
The marks of your territory
stand guard against the squatters.
Everyday hands are mending
your fences.  I don't mind
the barbs.  I'm your ranch
hand.  I do the job
with pride.
 
 
 
The rushing river ends
up slow and brown
in the prairie.  I am
completely in love
with your profile
against the mountains.
Your head moves up
and down with the horse.
 
 
 
Last night I ate mushrooms
in honor of the time
we tripped over the range.
I stepped in a cow patty
that reminded me of your hat.
Diamondbacks were
hanging from the scrub.
You dowsed the earth
and made the heavens roll.

Sandra, here's some Olson for you t'make you feel better:
 
"...unlike India, the soil, here, is most shallow, a few inches, & only
occasionally, in drift pockets, 6 inches or more. So the struggle of the
roots is intense. But a long time ago the boys beat it this way. It's
grass that is the big enemy of maize, the only real one, for they burn
off the bush, before they plant. But grass keeps coming in. And in the
old days, they were able to stand it off - for as long as seven years
(the maximum life of milpa) - by weeding out the grass by *hand*. But
then came the machete. And with it, the victory of grass in *two* years.
For ever since that iron, the natives cut the grass, and thus, without
having thought about it, spread the weed-seed, so that the whole milpa is
choked, quickly choked, and gone, forever, for use for, maize (grass is
so tough it doesn't even let brush or forest grow again!)
 
"One curious corallary, that, the Communist future of this peninsula will
have to reackon [sic] with: that, the ground is such, and its topography
so humped & rocked, that, still, the ancient method of planting - with a
pointed stick, and sowing, with the hands - is far superior to any
tractor or planter or whatever."
 
(_Mayan Letters_)
 
So odd, I think, someone (not you, Sandra) complaining weeks ago about this
list "degenerating" to discussions re: "crop rotation." Discussion of crops
not beneath Olson; why so beneath his readers?
 
Felt similarly w/respect to your "high" vrs. "low" culture
complaint/post. Were "sports" beneath Pindar? Tenth century Japanese
"correct" vs. "noncorrect" behavior (read: "gossip"--& her pillow book's
filled w/it) beneath Sei Shonagon? Whaling beneath Melville? Sappho,
Catullus..."vulgar"? _I Remember_ and _My Life_ wonderful because about
things seen in the Louvre? How much "high" art is, in fact, excusively
*about* "high" art? Even Joyce wrote lovely little bits about farting.
(The topic for two solid weeks on an e-space list devoted to Joyce.)
 
I love Olson, Sandra, but've found the discussions on this list re:
Hallmark much more interesting than the solemn "Achievement of Olson"-
acknowledgments here a week or so ago. Just 'cause Olson's name's dragged
into the discussion doesn't mean the talk's gonna be all that lively or
informative.
 
I know of no interesting writing that hasn't, specifically, addressed the
civilization in which the writing was done. TV & Hallmark (or
Hallmark-equivalent) are part of contemporary civilization. Seems natural
they come up as topics of discussion here.

Gary Sullivan -- Enjoyed your post and I completely agree with you.  Was
only meaning to say in my recent high/low comment that it shouldn't have
to be that one is laughed out of town if one enjoys Pindar and Olson as
well as sports and Hallmark.  I'd let ALL flowers bloom....
In fact, I about got thrown out of graduate school my first semester in
when, as I say in a poem about Rodin's mistress, "never was socialized
well," I screamed out "bullshit" in an auditorium full in response to a
professor trying to sell the high/low distinction....The guy wouldn't

Thank you your poem expressed the exact elements of the "Wild West" that
I was discussing.  I don't want to be mis interpreted, I do like westerns
and even more I adore horses.  I'm just interested in how the Mythical
cowboy has emerged once again in the decade of the politically correct.
Not that I want to discuss that nightmare.
        I just finished Cormac McCarthy's "All the Pretty Horses" and was
puzzled by its mass appeal.  I found it varying and inconsistent in
content and style.  I was equally swept away and disappointed.
        The langauge of the west is poetic as it combines old world
English with New world experience, but being a history major I feel it
takes far more than a few catch phrases to represent an era.  Historical
the representation of the western is very problematic.  There are
sensitive issues or race, sex,  religion and properity ownership to be
addressed.  The western of the 50's and 60's never bothered to address
these concerns and that is what has become the stereo type of the
perception of the west.
        Ondaatje has written a excellent docupoem about Billy the Kid,
but it content it reinforces the mythology of the Wild West.  I'm not
sure if this is good, bad, or accurate but it concerns me.  Possibly this
is because I've been reading Ovid, Tacitus and Virgil, and I've been
wondering how much of their poetry, histories and accounts are actual
history or gossip or poetic mythology.
        I spoke once with George Bowering and he told me of a discussion
he had with Ondaatje about writing a western without all the "Hoo-ha".
Ondaatje replied writing a western without the "hoo-ha" would be total
hoo-ha.  If this is possible then does that mean the stereotypes are so
ingrained in the genre that to remove them would create something
entirely different?

Dear Sandra:
     Yes, we're definitely in agreement. Great of you to yell bullshit,
when most'd only think it, in a crowded room. Reminds me of an anecdote a
poet in Hoboken, NJ, Joel Lewis, told me. He was teaching a poetry class
(at the Y, I think) and relating an anecdote to his students about the
first time he'd seen Sapphire read (or was it lecture?). Sapphire'd
started in on some apparently anti-Semitic spiel, and a woman in the
audience stood up and started yelling as loudly as she could, no one could
figure out what she was saying, just standing there yelling at the top of
her lungs. Well, as Joel's relating this anecdote to his class, he notices
one woman growing more & more uncomfortable, wanting to say something, and
finally she blurts out: "I *was* that woman!" She goes on to explain to
Joel & the class that she had been so horrified by what Sapphire'd been
saying, she'd had to drown it out, but couldn't think of anything to say,
so she just "lost it,"  stood up and began shouting SENTENCE FRAGMENTS off
the top of her head to block out the offensive spiel coming from the
stage.
     But, back to the point. Yes, no one should be laughed at for
preferring wonderful poetry to drivel. I haven't been in a university for
10 years, so don't know what the climate's like, but it's true enough that
poets are often seen, when seen at all at large, as clowns. There's a
wonderful bit in _The Sullen Art_, I think the interview with Rexroth,
where Rexroth's complaining about how Ginsberg (this is early 60s) plays
into this, by giving magazines like _Time_ ample opportunity to cast him
(&, I guess, other living poets, by association) in the role of village
idiot.  (Having just seen his performance yesterday in _Poetry in Motion_,
I've no problem following Rexroth's logic. Ginsberg's no moron, but man
can he play one on TV.) Do you know Gerald Burns's book, _Shorter Poems_?
Gerald's on the cover, in clown make-up & bowler-- he wrote me about it
once: "Writers are not just ignored. We are laughed at. We're a joke, wear
big shoes and red noses."
     But, given that this is an e-space of POETICS, I don't think you need
at all be worried about being laughed out for your "elitist" preferences.
I'd *hope* not, anyway. Beleaguered on occasion, maybe, & if I've
contributed to that, I'm sorry. The only reason I responded to your post
as I did was because I'm by nature admittedly paranoid, get a little
spooked when people mention anything smacking of "list management." That
probably wasn't even on your mind, & in any case, want to apologize for
overreacting.
     Anyway, Sandra, no big whoop, & best w/your article. (You'll post it
when you're through, yes?)
     Yours,
     Gary

Surely, Lindz, you know George Bowering's fabulous CAPRICE, a novel in

raised and that does the West the way the West was meant to be done....

Dear Gary,
          Re-Poetry in Motion and Ginsberg being no moron but playing one on
TV. I didn't read it that way. I thought he was great. And THAT suggests
something of what's involved  in moving across borders between 'high' and
'low'. It's one thing to have the attitude...its another thing to do the
hi-lo shuffle. (there was a singing group called the Hi-Los once) It's  a
good while since I last heard AG perform, but over the years I have greatly
admired his risk-taking. Again and again he would prove that someone who
won't be embarassed doesn't embarass. A deep confidence that will prove
itself. I don't know how long that sort of thing can sustain itself nor what
exactly are the conditions which enables to be achieved. Let's imagine a
reading of Hallmark verse, what would that be like?
        Wystan.

Dear Lindz:
 
Just caught your latest post after getting back from a matinee of *The
Wild Bunch* after rereading C. McCarthy's *Blood Meridian*. I guess I
think it's just too simplistic to speak of some singular "western" of
the ninties (as it is  to speak of this as "the politcally correct
decade"--somehow I don't think that's Newt's agenda). It was wild
seeing Bill Holden and the bunch again all these bloody years later,
and the ways in which the movie (which seemed so outrageous 25 years
ago) is so deeply infused with the romance of 60's "outlaw politics"--
(this on the day after the EU accused Canada of Wild West politics and
piratery off the grand banks--yahoooo, get out yer wire cutters, Bri,
ain't nobody nettin' us in--the iconographic problem here being, are
we the ranchers or the sheepherders?).
 
Compare it with McCarthy's *Blood Meridian* (which is much less
sentimental than *Horses*) or for that matter Eastwood's *The
Unforgiven* and you begin to approach the complexity of the issues
here. I don't think it's ever been a question of simply deploying
"stereotypes" (for the ultimate of that cynicism, see F. Gump).
Compare, for instance, *Wyatt Earp* with *Tombstone* which came out
within six months of each other, and which treat all the mythologems
of the Earp myth differently (especially the famous shootout story
where the Earp gang gets pinned down by the Clantons at the river and
Wyatt gets up and walks into a hail of bullets blasting away
unscathed. *Tombstone* has it as a kind of divine intervention, where
Kevin, to give him his due, portrays it as a kind of mindless,
desperate luck--but now we're into *Pulp Fiction*). Which is the
"nineties" version?
 
Anyway, all this by way of saying, yeah, yahoo, but whose yahoo, and
yahoo how?
 
Best,
Mike

My posts from work seem not to be getting out to the net. So if you see

But, Philo T. Farnsworth (a great name) was one of the early inventors
of television, did much of his work in SF and has a plaque to his
achievements on a wall on Sansome Street in North Beach, just across
from the large Hunan Cuisine. Kaufman would have walked past that plaque
on a regular basis. Don't know where the Arthur comes in, tho....
 
Also, back to another post I made that never got out, Darrell Gray
worked for Hallmark in the late 60s or early 70s, right after MFA
school, and gave me the impression that some of the other Iowa City
grads did likewise. When I was in KC two years ago, I stayed at the
hotel right next to the big mall that Hallmark "sponsors," and noted
that their corporate tagline read:
 
"Hallmark, America's largest producer of greet cards and social
expression products."
 
Productizing social expression does seem to be what it's all about.

I'd also recommend Dorn's Captain Jack's Chaps, or HOUSTON/MLA, which
brings the West into the contemporary Modern Language Association
context, Hyattexture, and more. Also bp Nichol's version of billy the kid
, THE TRUE EVENTUAL STORY OF BILLY THE KID, in Nichol's CRAFT DINNER (Aya
Press, 1978), is marvelous.

I agree to dismantle the stereo type the genre is too simplistic, but
what I think I'm hung up on is the aspect that this medium is full of
myth that a lot of people take as the truth. ( Out of 1000 Americans
polled around 49% thought F Gump was a documentary, but after the Oscars
last night I will now go into convulsions if I hear one more Gump quote)
        I suppose part of the building of the west was a dream, the last
frontier and all that but it makes me wonder about how I am represented
by this.  My father grew up along the Oregon trail, living on
reservations as his step father built the rail line.  The way he
describes it there was no romance to this lifestyle.  He spent lonely
summers in the hills cooking for the sheep herders and to this day he
will not ride a horse again.  This was no Wyatt Earp world.  My ancestors
hailed from Norway and Scotland settling in Utah to do the homestead
thing and then pushed on to Central Oregon.  What I would give to know
how they lived.  Looks like I have a western of my own to write.
 
        And for my recommended reading list Howard O'Hagon's *Tay John*.
This novel is epic tale of Western myth. However, it has been critiqued
for slight misogynist undertones, but personally I haven't found one that
doesn't find women contemptable.

I agree with Sandra that there are most definately examples of
contemporary gunsmoke engaged in a shootout with the genre.  In
fact, I wuld go so far as to say that the genre is becoming the
story in works like CAPRICE and SLINGER.  I suppose its the differnce
between writing about the wild west and The Wild West.  Lindz,
you might also want to take a look at Nichol, Spicer and
McClure's *Billy the Kid*s.  Ah yes, "Billy had a short dick
but they did not call him Richard".  You card.

Dear Sandra & Wystan:
     Sandra, in your original post you'd mentioned an editor asking you &
others to write about something "forbidden," and you'd mentioned possibly
writing about the intolerance of elitism. That's the article I'd meant.
Would love to read it if you do it.
     Wystan, I like what you say about Ginsberg's proving time & again
that someone who won't be embarrassed doesn't embarrass--I think that's
accurate w/respect to his intentions, and I think in some cases he even
proved as much; though, I do wonder how much of that gets used as an
excuse to sluff off responsibility. I guess I know one too many younger
poets he's aggressively hit on, casting-couch style, to give the guy
complete benefit of the doubt w/respect to his "good" intentions.
     W/respect to his performing his "rock music" as "risk taking"--no
difference between that & the first-time open-mike-nighter, up there
reading the first thing s/he's scrawled to paper. Nothing wrong with it,
but can't help but think that if it were anyone but Ginsberg up there
being that incompetent, no one'd give him the time of day. My idea of
risk-taking involves something more than exercising one's "star power" (a
great song by Sonic Youth, btw) and, while I do have a lot of respect for
Ginsberg as a poet, I guess I don't see the value in everything he does,
myself. Would never ask (or even want) him to "stop the madness" so to
speak, but reserve the right to hit the VCR's "mute" button & put on
(say) something by the Hi-Los when he gets tedious. Or to question
anyone's "Just Do It" approach when it involves (say) sexual harassment.
     Yours,
     Gary

This is a call for your out-of-print chapbooks / books that you might

libraries have received authority from the US Dept. of Educ. via OCLC

Dear John Geraets,
         That question might well be private, but you've asked me on
this list, how I've fared with the mainstream :  so briefly, I have not been anthologised in NZ (Michael
Morrisey asked me for a piece of fiction, I sd no; nobody else has
asked me).  Three little books were published offset from my old
Sharp electronic typewriter (a machine that was subsequently  near
demolished by my kids).  "Software" was published by Splash, but I
was an editor and typed it, photo-copied  and  designed cover from my
own photos.  Distribution of the first three was by hand, knocking on
doors and sales at readings.  Software went thru the Splash
distribution list, assisted by Segue.  Most sales "by hand" or
exchanges.  One piece in "Landfall" only because Michele Leggott edited
a special number.  The "her axolotl" poem (20 years ago went
where?....)in a magazine.   Graham Lindsay gave me space in Morepork,
Alan Loney in Parallax, , otherwise that's about it.
 
I never wanted,don't particularly want, a literary career.
 
The record for art history is about the same.  I edited the Bulletin
of New Zealand Art History (with Michael Dunn) for about nine years)
and when there was a shortage of copy I wrote more to fill it.
The two little Poussin books are in photocopy, A5, off my typewriter,
but in the NZ General Assembly for copyright purposes.
 These were distributed as gifts mostly, or sold to students by the
department of art history for  $1 each, cost.
 
What I have had printed in quantity here is art criticism and art
journalism and essays for catalogues.  That's pleasant enough, and
what the Mainstream thinks I'm useful for.
 
John Byrum, in Ohio, was hospitable and included pieces in Generator
I and 2.  That was through the friendship of Tom Beckett  (who
introduced me to the extraordinary work of Frank Fecko, and later to
Frank, when I visited him in 1987 0r 8).  I have done very little
about trying to publish poems etc otherwise.  And I don't work at
writing poetry that much anyway.
 
I have always though my most interesting relation with text is in the
classroom esp in seminars.
 
U.S. readers of this all know by now where the delete button
is....but that is about right for the info you asked for.

Subject:      hallmark and social expression
 
we poets are social expressions of social expressions.
we consume poetry and are consumed by it
hallmark users consume hallmark cards but are not consumed by them: they just
use them.
hallmark poetry is applied poetry. nonhallmark poetry is theoretical poetry
except for the kind that allows no relief & no retreat which is also applied
poetry.

Oh, you're roping me into territory I'm not responding to directly.  I
was just taking issue with . . . --god, what was it?--a characterization
of teaching as being simply about earning money or some other equally
vulgar end (as necessary and nice as earning cash for our labor in that
underpaid enterprise is).  And now that I think about it perhaps what the
real problem is is people who continually try to divorce politics and the
classroom and, even poetry from politics (now that you've lured me here),
because that seems to me to "aestheticize" aesthetics to the point of
triviality that simply reinforces the marginality of the arts to culture
and society so that not only are they not studied but continue to fall
away from any sense of having to do with people's lives.  Separating the
areas of life you suggest is the problem.  It only reinforces the view
that art is art and has nothing to do with anything else.  If there were
a pernicious "political" view it is this.
 
I hope you don't mind me posting this to the list . . .

titled _Cantos_.  Here's a taste from the first section:
 
X antecanto: the xicano sign
 
   These cantos chicanos begin with X and end with X. They are examples
of xicano verse, verse marked with the cross, the border cross of alambre
and rio, the cross of Jesus X in Native America, tha nahuatl X in mexico,
mexicano, xicano. It is our mark, our cross, our X, our sign of never
ceasing being born at the point of two arrows colliding, X, and at the
gentle laying of one line over another line, X. It is the sound we make
to mark one and other. August 29, familia, raza, as well as to exclude
ourselves from the patterns of death imposed from without.  We sign the X
each time we speak we cross at least one border. And because it is our
sign andamos cruzando cruzados, naciendo siendo xicanos otra vex, cada
vez, esta vez. I am the point of my own X but the arms, los brazos vienen
de lejos, and the arms reach far.

Subject:      back to poetry
 
Blair stated
 
        "Political statements can be poetry or propaganda or both.
Propoganda can be the truth in a political context. But if it is poetry,
the residue that is left will be regarded more for its aesthetic content
than its political. Because politics has a way of being current and art
has a way of being eternal or out of time."
 
 
I dont believe that I can agree that art or poetry  is out of time or
eternal. True western culture worships the written word enough to
transcribe and save texts, yet so much is lost too.  I love the phrases
and glips of poetry left behind by Sappho, but I do not know her true
intention in writing unless I study the time in which she has written
these verses.  Her words have lasted time, but has her context?
        In English lit we are blessed with an abundance of writers that
annoy and study each other so it is easier to preserve the implied
connotations or the motive of the writing.  In that sense politics of the
era, the social mood are essential to eternalizing the "art".  Words are
words and only become poetry when they have meaning.  Cultural aesthetics
are needed to appreciate and render something into art, but these are not
eternal and definitely not universal.

Subject:      Arthur Godfrey, Allen Ginsberg
X-cc:         rsillima@vanstar.com
 
The Arthur Godfrey suggestion (re Kaufman & Farnsworth) is interesting.
It set off some loose associations...
 
I was surprised at how thoroughly Godfrey in particular and his
generation of music in general dominated Ted Berrigan's 1959 record
collection (see appendix to Padgett's wonderful _Ted_) and how much rock
and its various protoancestors were NOT represented there. It made me
wonder about musical influences on the poetry. I've heard both Bernstein
and Watten wax quite eloquent on the subject of the influence of Bob
Dylan on their work. Me too. Meeting Dylan at Newport in '64 was once
the highpoint of my life.
 
And certainly several members of my G1 generation have fantasized
themselves as rock stars at one time or another, ranging from the
successful (Patti Smith, Jim Carroll, Laurie Anderson) to the whistfully
silly (Serpent Power w/ Coolidge & Meltzer). Burroughs collaborating w/
Anderson does seem to show what's possible. And lets not forget the
Fugs.
 
Ginsberg on the harmonium reminds me simultaneously of Bly and his idiot
dulcimer, but also of the peculiar problematics of being Allen Ginsberg
as well (if I were feeling more generous, I might imagine that Bly faces
similar issues). Ginsberg is perpetually confronted with reading to
large audiences that have very little knowledge of his genre, his
generation, his anything. His performance works of the past 15 years or
so seem to me to address precisely that conundrum. They don't work on
the page at all, but they aren't really intended to. The Don't Smoke
piece (don't even know if this is in print) is a terrific piece of
theater, which is really what it is.
 
On the other hand, Ginsberg is at heart a satirist (this he shares w/
Bernstein & perhaps Perelman also) rather than an epic poet, say, or a
lyric one. I've been struck in the past 6 months how much the
performance model for both Ginsberg & Bernstein seems to be, say, Lenny
Bruce (or George Carlin or Andy Kaufman or Lord Buckley) rather than
who? Dylan Thomas? Paul Blackburn? The model seems to propose very
difference functions for a text in the setting of performance.
 
McClure once told me that his generation "missed the boat" when it
failed to convince the 60s rockers (thinking, I think, explicitly of the
Grateful Dead & the Doors) that they needed to get their lyrics from the
poets. All those royalties....
 
On the other hand, Robert Hunter (who IS the Dead's chief dramaturg) has
been a very sympathetic reader of many people on this list & has read in
public with the likes of Palmer, Hejinian, Watten, Harryman & Yrs truly.
 
Go figure.

no, it's not art for art's sake, but a question, literally, of what comes first.no one these days could argue, i trust, that aesthetics are sufficient, but one might argue that the poem is such insofar as it fulfills its own necessities.

Hi Loss, yes I'm very interested in this. Can I be naive and ask how do I
get involved  -  I'd be keen to do two things, and they might require
completely different approaches.
 
1. To submit a kind of selected of my own work for an author site, would
include visual work, text work and sound work  -  sometimes all three
interlinked versions under the same title.
 
2. To have some old chaps both by myself and others I've published  -
Allen Fisher, P.C.Fencott, Chris Mason and others - catalogued.
 
But you might be confined to U.S. authors or publishers.
Just curious, as always
 
If you are then in what format would I submit? Who does the formatting?
 
respect

Sandra, that's a total bummer about the Journal of Communications. But,
if you want to consider writing & publishing such a piece somewhere,
here's an address for you:
 
EXILE
Curt Anderson, editor
P.O. Box 1840
St. Paul, MN  55101
 
Curt's always looking for material for this quarterly newsletter-style
journal, & frankly, as I'm the first person he hits up for work when
he (inevitably) finds he needs more material, you'd be doing me a favor
writing something for it. That goes for anyone on this list, by the way.
The magazine's mostly made up of book reviews & satirical pieces, but
Curt wants to publish more "serious" things if he can.
 
Anyone interested in seeing an issue of the thing can write to the
address above, or e-mail me w/your snail-mail (I've got a few extra
copies of the last issue sitting around.) Subscriptions are $2.50 for 4
issues, or the equivalent in stamps.
 
Also, if anyone'd like their books or MANUSCRIPTS reviewed, send 'em to
the same address above. (Curt's especially looking for manuscripts to
review.)
 
Yours,
 
Gary

Subject:      Ginsberg, Sorrentino
 
Returned to my copy of _The Sullen Art_ to check who'd said what about
Ginsberg & discovered it wasn't Rexroth but Gilbert Sorrentino who'd been
talking about him. Here's the quote for anyone interested:
     "Allen has always annoyed me because, of all that group of so-called
Beat poets, his is an outstanding intelligence, and it constantly annoys
me that he allows himself to be used. Certainly not used by other poets,
but by the people who have always hated poetry--the vested interests, the
commercialists, the buyers and sellers. Ginsberg can talk for an hour
about how he loathes _Life_, _Time_, _Fortune_, money, banking, and _Life_
and _Time_ will spread-eagle him on the wall with his own words. His words
don't have the power to destroy _Life_ and _Time_. That's why he gets so
much space in them and one of the reasons he is so used by them. He's not
an enemy of _Life_ and _Time_--he *is* an enemy in his own heart, as every
poet must be--but they're not afraid of him and they make the fool of him.
     "It's very peculiar. It's a reversion to Romanticism. It's the
Romantic scream against the watered-down principles of Locke, which
controlled the 19th century. As the Romantics screamed against Locke, they
made Locke righter. The more they said 'Down With Locke,' in so many
different ways: 'I fall upon the thorns of life, I bleed,' et cetera, the
more they continually made Locke seem right. Locke was wrong. But they
didn't prove it so.  He said, or was taken to have said, when his
philosophy was watered down a hundred years later, as philosophies always
are for the people, 'Poetry is junk--evanescent, something to curl up with
on a winter's evening. It has nothing to do with life.' The old cry of the
businessman. So the Romantics said, 'That's right, Locke, you bet it is.'
And they just kept screaming about the wild blue yonder. It wasn't until
the 19th century Frenchmen that poetry once again became what it
is--something having to do directly with life, something that can be used
to control your life, something that can be used to make your life a
better thing. They got back to the concrete, they got back to the world
that Locke accused them of rejecting."
     Don't know how much I agree w/the above, especially as I was born
after the interview took place so don't know what, specifically, was going
on re: _Life_ and _Time_ and Ginsberg's words being "used against him."
Would welcome elaboration or repudiation of what Sorrentino says by anyone
who was there at the time.
     Yours,
     Gary

Ron and others,
 
I'm enjoying this thread immensely. And I think Don't Smoke -- the real
name is "Put Down Yr Cigarette Rag" -- is superb. I believe it's a great
way to introduce Ginsberg to students, bringing in political concerns and
improv/open field type ideas at once. Even the frat boys in their
baseball caps look impressed...
        The text is printed in _First Blues_ (Full Court Press, 1975).
I haven't sprung for the CD box set yet, but I do know you can get the
performance on cassette from the Smithsonian's Folkways series. Call
(202) 287-3262 to order or for free Folkways catalog.

Pardners,
Don't forget Clear the Range, a western novel by Ted Berrigan,
written using the cross-out method on a dime paperback.
It's hilarious, stately, and strange. Like Bill Luoma's campfire
songs, it says something about formality, loneliness, and wide
open space, key elements of the western ethos. Berrigan also
speaks often of The Code of the West in his Sonnets.
 
For a contemporary working out of neighboring thematics,
check out Merrill Gilfillan's Sworn Before Cranes (Faber &
Faber1994). It's a beautiful book of short stories set on
the High Plains mostly among Indian people the author has
known or visited.
 
See you round the ridges,
Kit Robinson

I too feel a kind of personal stake in both the mythicizing (word?) and
de-mythicizing of the American west. Up 'till my great grandmother died
a few years ago, I heard much of the journey west, but more of what
happened once they settled in the California desert.
     What's interesting for me is that most of these stories fit
fairly comfortable within the myth. Hardship overcome and all that.
But there have always been disturbing hints of things that might not
fit, at least to my family. Hints about family being hung somewhere, a
picture of an old man dated 1878 with something scrawled on the back
that may be "almost hung," plus a lot of hints about major drinking
problems.
     Further and most disturbing to my grandmother, were thehints of
racial mixing. Before GG died, she used to tell stories about being
ostracized in her community. When my mother asked why she replied that
she was Indian, but          no one else in the family talks about this,
and most of us are blonde and blue eyed. Also, once when I showed my
great uncle a picture of my great great grandmother, his mother, he
chuckled and said (please excuse the language but I am only quoting)
"nigger in the wood pile."Hints betray both attitude and uncertainty.
     My point isthat I think there is a reason for a lot of this mythmaking,
a lot of the tall tales, and that is to disguise. Disguise  exactly what is
not the myth: the crimes, the banality. The everyday nature of the murder
of native Americans and Chinese, and Mexican Americans, certainly in CA,
where it was probably the worst in the country.In my family, the myth
certainly had this function.Diguise  that the West is still a secret.
     Two books I would recommend :Richard Drinnon's _Facing West:The
Metaphysics of Indian-Hating and Empire Building_(Meridian, 1980) and
Lillian Schlissel _Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey_ (Schocken,
1992) Drinnon's seems a little obvious now, but still interesting,
the Diaries are incredible.
Thanks, Eric.

Absolutely Tony. Basically all I was saying is that indoctrination is
"gross." But I like what you've done with this kind of triadic structure
of the classroom (at least as I see it). You've got a text, which is
assumed to be known, you've got a teacher which is assumed to be
knowing, and you've got a student which is assumed to be unknowing.
It's basically an analytical situation of the early Freud years (funny
how that works), ie, ucs, analyst, analysand.
     The problem with this in the classroom is that it is static (and
here we are talking about a worst case kind of thing). There seems little
room for interaction, and above all for resistance (of the text of the master
of the student). It's so darn structural! This is what I think we have to
get rid of, perhaps by team teaching, perhaps by more radical methods. It
seems to me that to be a teacher means always to be a student of the
resistance of the text to interpretation and of the student to indoctrination,
and of above of  our own resistances to the fact that we aren't masters of
the material and that the material cannot be mastered.
     Thanks, Eric.

Dear Eric,
         An NZ equivalent cd be the stories of Spanish ancestry going
back to the Spanish Armada of 1588, accounting for dark eyes and
colouring among Anglo-Scottish families.  One woman that I know who
has a  Maori grandmother said that that was the story in her family
for a long time.  My wife's family maintain the same story about
themselves, which leads to, as you say, a kind of interesting
"uncertainty"....

Cris,
 
I am responding to you via the list since it is an important question.
I have gotten a number of questions personally on this but I do want
to explain this somewhat more.
 
Basically, I am a poet and writer, etc. but I have worked for years
now in this world of the library. As one might note from my book,
_Small Press: An Annotated Guide_, a lot of my effort has been getting
the "marginal" into routes that facilitate people connecting with what
I would think we might agree are important works.
 
Here then, the "rub." That is, this is an unprecedented opportunity.
This OCLC project I have mentioned is not only one of the FIRST
efforts at making etexts available through library catalogs - as well
as world-wide interlibrary loan systems - but it is incredible that we
have been able to negotiate the presence of POETRY in this important
project.
 
I have worked very hard for this and I think this is a historic
moment, we are seeing a possibility for poetry to be made accessible
to many many thousands of people.
 
OK, more coming further in this post...

1. There are NO restrictions as to nationality, etc. This is not an
"American" thing.
 
2. I would prefer texts marked up in html but will accept ascii
submissions. I would feel even better if you are committed to
converting the ascii texts to html; I would of course provide advice
and direction.
 
3. You may conceive of texts - selected, collected, an individual
series - however you wish. This is simply like publishing a chapbook.
It could be any permutation of your complete work as you see suits
your work. (In this regard it is perfect - make your piece and we
present it to the world.)
 
4. Multimedia formats are NO problem. If you are in this situation I
will work this out with you individually. You will need to use html
though, to present these works. Graphical files must be .gif files.
Sound files must be .au (unix format) though I am working endlessly to
mount a program here that will convert, so that you may submit these
sound files in other formats.
 
Note: Ken and I ENCOURAGE multimedia gigs. In fact, that is the
strenght of the Internet, no?
 
5. Yes, you may submit work by other authors as long as you have
permission.
 
OK - let's make it happen!
 
All best to all on the list,
 
Loss

Eric,
 
        Your personal insight was very helpful.  I wish that I had the
living sources to discuss the westwad crawl of my relaives, unfortunatly
all i have is a family tree.  I found a rather intriguing poem in the
Utne Reader regarding American myth and I'd like to share it with everyone
,I hope I'm allowed to do this.

For Edna and Mildred
 
Mourning the dying American female names
 
In the Altha Diner on the Florida panhandle
a stocky white-haired woman
with a plastic nameplate "Mildred"
gently turns my burger, and I fall into grief.
I remember the long, hot drives to North Carolina
to visit my Aunt Alma, who put up quarts of peaches,
and my grandmother Gladys with her peirced quilts
Many names are almost gone:Gertrude, Myrtle,
agnes, Bernice, Hortense, Edna, Doris, and Hilda.
They were wide women, cotton clothed, early rising.
You had to move your mouth to say their names,
and they meant strength, spear, battle, and victory.
When did women stop being Saxons and Goths?
What frog Fate turned them into Alison, Melissa,
Valerie, Natalie,Adreinne, and Lucinda,
diminshed them to Wendy, Cindy, Suzy, and Vicky?
I look at these young women
and hope they are headed for the presidnecy,
but I fear America has other plans in mind,
that they be no longer at war
but subdued instead in amorphous corporate work,
somebodies assistant, something ina bank,
single parent with word processing skills.
They must have been made French
so they could be cheap foriegn labor.

Is this just limited to US publishers? I've got a handful of out of print

be other small Australian publishers who would be in a similiar position.

Eric, assuming in the classroom and out that students know in the
sense of are responsive as teachers are is not difficult to do.  It's
hard to find any evidence for a contrary assumption.      What
students are unlikely to be able to do is locate a "text" (or
"image") within the always ongoing process of
criticism/evaluation/history of that "text".  Cross-referencing opens
the "text" to renewed attention, in which  students are often great
contributors.  Yesterday (anecdote, anecdote.... ) Anna Tam asks why
-- in tutorial after lecture -- the boys (attendants of Flora in a Triumph of Flora have black wings,
what is that on the ground, a head?) and the rest of the group climb
in.  Best thing is I hadn't thought about that (is there an
explanatory text somewhere a la Panofsky?) and the current literature
doesn't cover it, so this opens questions, and Anna is off to try
to make sense of this herself.  (If only I weren't so caught up in other
classes to-day on something else altogether....)     Describing
pictures (for M.A.) students has got around to describing a particular
small brick wall  (prize of $5 for the "best") this week.  The bit I
put in was a reading of Pound's Agassiz story (ABC of Reading)-- the
fish + discussion on last week's descriptions....
         Fine, until someone starts to worry about quantities of
information (communication of messages) in the class.  Isn't that where
the authoritarian structuring of classes has a firm hold; or in the
demands for execution of specified form-filling exercises, with the
expectation of fulfilling discipline norms established in
advance, getting the right answers in one shape or another.
         But just in case I sound smug in any way, let me also say,
woken by thunder and sounds of heavy rain on the roof, I had trouble
getting back to sleep last night, thinking of all the places I'd gone
wrong in yesterday's teaching.
          Got to go and check out the Seven Acts of Mercy: last week
in class I couldn't recite them, apropos Caravaggio's painting.  The
tutorial class concerned is meant to come up with the answer today.
Funnily enough, one of them could do the Seven Dwarfs, and another
did Santa's reindeers, and I could do the Seven Sacraments, but
that's another tale.

Dear Gary,
         I don't know anything about G. hitting on young people and sexual
harassment or any stuff like that. And it seems a ways away from what I was
trying to describe which had to do with performance and audience crossover
(hi-to-lo, lo-to-high). I brought it up because ' be more popular' is easier
said than done, so what are the conditions for doing, and the measures for
success? And actually I looked at the tape again--isn't Bukowski an
embarassment? And Ed Sanders's great, and that Kenward Elmslie!!--and the G.
clip is fine by me, I think he gets it about right. I found Ron Silliman's
comments relevant to the question of conditions. That is, 'popular' means
young in the contexts he has in mind. Gotta go now.
        Wystan.

                    Hi Ed, sometimes I wish I had a 3 line limitation.
You didn't get anything back from me because I didn't know how to respond
to your question. Sometime I feel trapped in an e-mail responsibility of my
own darned making. There aren't enough hours in the day and night free to
answer and sort and simply digest all the mail. I wasn't sure whether your
post was a question 'requiring' an answer or a statement couched in
rhetorical terms. And so the issue of response enters this reply right
away. Weasels of worlds!
 
>responsibility's become "i respond even if you do
>n't ask," which is arrogance, it may be, of teacher, poet, etc. who is (yr
>>sense) responsible.
 
                    I kind of reversed your approach. That is you asked and
I didn't respond. It does seem difficult to understand how it can possibly
work the other around though. Or am I being typically pedantic? You can see
I'm floundering into trying to make a 'proper' response. To think this
through.
 
                    I want to ask some questions. In the context of a
listserv such as this (let's take a trial example that 'might' travel  -)
is it ok to say that anything posted to Multiple recipients can be
responded to. It might well be Eric and Maria and Kali and Tony are
discussing a subject but that discussion is posted 'out in the open'. If
you and anybody else wanted to comment under that subject heading or break
into it to ask a question or beg to disagree  -  no problem. Yes? Your
response hasn't been asked for but you made one. You still had the ability
and by responding you kept that ability engaged. Equally your 'response'
might be ignored.
 
                    Extend that example to conversation. (remember the hit
and miss aspects of communication  -  informational content,
misunderstanding, tone, deliberate misreading, diverse personalised
interpretation, adoptions of persona and many many others . . . call for
submissions) Extend that to education. Current discussions on education
seems focussed onto institutional forms  -  hell! When I left school I set
out to learn something  -  particularly when it came to poetry. Please
don't let this board become a counselling lounge for academics! (sorry
everyone - myself included) Otherwise  - shit I just got deleted!
 
                    Now one problem lies in many subscribers (and some have
identified themselves as such, including myself) wanting to respond to many
more posts than they in fact 'allow' themselves to do. But that is not a
withholding of the ability to respond, it is if anything a keening of it.
(there's a fun double edge there) And I'm aware this heads back into
discussions re list overload  -  lurker and poster, representation of
diversity of opinion and constituency and so on. And also discussions re -
speed of response (gender / reflection / compositional preference /
one-up/man/ship and so on). This listserv as a visit to The Boffin Shop.
 
                    Which points up one other feature becoming apparent  -
being the similarity between the public front of the list as a performance
space and the familiarity traits of Improvised music becoming more
etiquette bound and running to 'similar' boundaries in majority cases.
(examine for a moment the mechanics of statement / response / variation /
negation and other) A point raised by Ira a couple of months back and left
on the ground where its nose dropped. Subjects appear to come around in,
albeit buckled, cycles  -  partly as new subscribers jump on. Partly as
variations concur.
 
                    It still seems to me that this can become still more of
a LIVE space (not as in MOO). Sufficiently subtle and sensitive and robust
as to be able to respond to the varied needs of its subscribers. If this
listserv is an e-mergent community then issues of responsibility should be
discussed.
 
          Call M-e I-r-r-e-s-p-o-n-s-i-b-l-e
 
 
then call me e-mail (I can't help it)

Subject:      To Wystan, more Ginsberg
 
Dear Wystan:
     I totally, totally appreciate your--& others--going to bat for
Ginsberg; I'm well aware I'm expressing (very) personal taste here, & have
learned a thing or two from what you & others on this list've said about
how they see his work. Maybe "learned..."  is the wrong way to put it:
more accurately, you all've offered different ways of looking at what he
does, different approaches, for which I'm most grateful. "Ginsberg as
Bruce-like satirist,"  for instance, is something I can definitely
appreciate, really adds to my sense of the value of his work. Even of
_Howl_--I've got two different recordings of him reading that: one, an
early recording, he's very nervous, reading quickly, the work sounding, as
read, completely angry & serious; the second a later reading (at Naropa, I
think, late '70s, early '80s), he's more laid-back, allowing the humor to
come through--almost as though these are two different poems! Wonderful,
wonderful to have these, a great reminder for me how easy it is to
"pigeonhole" anything, & how wrong that is.
     G.'s playing the wolf on occasion probably has nothing to do with
what you were saying; it does have something to do with how I was reading
what you were saying, particularly that wonderful line of yours re:
"embarrassment." I read that as including *all* public behavior (G. being
a very public figure), & so included instances wherein my sense of his
freewheeling public behavior would seem to have destructive/harmful
effects. Because I'd read what you'd said earlier as a kind of "Ginsberg
as anti-uptight role-model" endorsement (& I'm in agreement w/you about
that!), that's why I'd brought up these instances. You say you know
nothing about G.'s hitting on young people--well, I happen to know about
that; the guy hit on one of my best friends, & I've heard about similar
experiences w/a number of other younger poets. I can't erase these
instances from my memory; they linger & when people endorse, wholesale,
his freewheeling spirit, these instances serve for me as somewhat
cautionary reminders. "In dreams begin responsibility," as the saying
goes.
     But, geez, I certainly don't mean to dismiss the guy; his work means
a lot to me. &, sure, Bukowski's "writing = taking a dump" on that tape is
a ridiculous cliche', forgettable.  Elmslie's performance had me rolling
on the floor w/laughter--the effect (or one of the effects) he no doubt
wanted. Sanders has a lovely & hilarious bit in his novel _Fame & Love in
New York_ about the need to constantly be *inventing* things, starting new
projects--his "finger" synthesizer, & tie-keyboard being real- world
examples of that. (I never know how "seriously"--at face value, I mean--to
take what he does, his having edited _Fuck You:  A Magazine of the Arts_.)
(A fairly serious journal actually, despite what the title might lead one
to assume.)
     Anyway, I'd never, never write off Ginsberg as a poet or performer,
even though I'm not as interested in everything he does, or am not always
convinced his motivation's pure. I wonder, for instance, at his GAP
khaki's ad--which you may or may not have seen in NZ. (They appeared here
in the States in magazines like _The New Yorker_ and _Interview_.) When
Ginsberg sells his image to corporate interests--when *anyone* does that
(William Burroughs sold his image to Nike shoes for a TV commercial!), I
have to wonder about "motivation." Ginsberg & Burroughs both seem, in
their writing, to be thoroughly "anti-corporate." So, what gives? I was
living in the Haight-Ashbery district in San Francisco when the GAP opened
one of its stores, right there on Haight Street, & my memory was that
there was some local resistance--including posting of anti-GAP/corporate
interest flyers & the like. So, some of what Ginsberg does doesn't jive
w/me, has me "questioning," is what I'm--finally--saying, I guess. When I
read that Sonic Youth (my favorite rock & roll band, notorious for their
recording *right over* a recording of Madonna on their _Ciccone Youth_
l.p.) had done a GAP ad, too, it absolutely depressed me; colored--which
isn't to say completely "destroyed"--my appreciation of their work. In the
PR kit I received w/Ginsberg's latest book, _Cosmopolitan Greetings_
(which includes a reprint of that anti-smoking rag, btw), his publicist
was actually *bragging* about the GAP ad, suggesting it as being
indicative of the "complexity" of Ginsberg's character.  Well, my take was
simply that it was a mistake for him to've done that, not something I'd
feel comfortable endorsing. Can't imagine Lenny Bruce appearing in an ad
for the GAP, I guess. (Though, God knows, maybe he did appear in an ad or
two for something, or would've, if he'd've lived long enough.) (At any
rate, the GAP has undoubtedly bought the rights to his image, & plan to
use it, if they've not already--corporate interests will get their slimy
hands on us one way or the other. Ah, well.)
 
     Yours,
 
     Gary "Windbag, Nonsenso's sister's son" Sullivan

Well yes, then, you would probably want to supply ascii. If you were
interested, you might learn html later, which is a mark-up language
that permits some basic formatting and the possibility of making links
in World-Wide Web documents. (I'm not sure if you even have world-wide
web access. Sometimes this is obtained by typing
lynx
at your system prompt.) One basic use of html is that you can mark
your ascii text, for example, so that there is a table of contents and
the user can jump to the section of the text indicated by the table of
contents. That's one of the basic uses.
 
You can get more info about html by using the web to go to:
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html
 
You may wish to submit ascii first and investigate html as time
permits; it takes a while to learn but is very useful.
 
All best,

Well, Tony, that's funny, re Olson and "real" historians. I am
engaged in writingh a history book now, for penguin. I applied for an
academic grant, and got turned down, because the granting agency sent
my application to some history professors. They were nice enough to
send me copies of the profs' reports. One of them, which was filled
with very bad English, said I should not get anything because, for
instance, I was going to go to local museums instead of a centralized
archive, as a real historian would do. So it goes.

A very quick literal version of the quote would give something like
this:
 
        "O, I have lost them all in the arms, only you, you are
constantly born anew."
 
As I don't have the context, this is all I can do at 6 a.m. The
awkward "the arms" could possibly become "my arms"

Sappho--phainetai moi
 
 
It appears to me that his godhead
divines your little one on one.
He plays forward on the sweet phone
of your acuteness
 
and galling desirability.
This is my cardiac chest unfeathering.
When I see you, nothing comes
to me to speak.
 
My tongue is broken.  Straightway
a fine flame consumes my skin.
With my eyes I see nothing and hear
forebodings of rain.
 
A cold sweat downs me.  A trembling
seizes all.  I am more green than
grass time.  I am dead no less
than I appear.
 
 
 
 
Sappho--hoi men hippeon straton
 
 
Most men take strategic knights, while others
claim armymen; the rest hold up battleships
as the greatest show on earth. But I declaim.
It's who do you love.
 
It's no trouble to cinch this once and for all.
For she was Helena, beauty of the mortal
elsewhere, who left the man, the aristocrat,
behind.
 
And went floating off to Troy, with no
mind for offspring or beloved parents.
Love walked her sideways, knowing
straightway.
 
For swayed
       lightly                 t            one
       puts me in mind of Anaktoria, now
out of sight.
 
I would rather see her step the lovely
and do the facial shine more than any
continental chariot decked with soldiers
under arms.
 
 
 
Sappho--poikilothron' athanat' aphrodita
 
 
Thronechanging amortal Aphrodite,
child of Zeus deceit weaver, Hey Lady,
don't break my heart on the yoke
of grief and ailment.
 
But come on down.  Do you remember when
you answered my call?  It was a long distance
and you listened and left your father's
golden dome,
 
having yoked the chariot.  The beauties
led you, swift sparrows over black earth,
dense feathers cutting spirals from heaven
to the middle of air.
 
They arrived on a dime, with blessed you
smiling the amortal smile.  And you asked:
"What's all this then? Why do you bother
to call?
 
How far across the nation did your heart
range this time?  Whose pretty little head
can I turn your way?  O Sappho, who's been
so mean to you?
 
Listen, if she hides now, soon she will seek.
If she won't say thankyou, soon she'll say please.
If she doesn't want it now, soon she'll be wanting,
but not willingly."
 
 
Come on.  Loose me far away from high
anxiety.  However much my little heart
wants to consume, you consummate.  You,
yourself, stand by my side.

Gary, the weasel asks:
when GAP buy Ginsberg don't they also somehow endorse all that he has done
and  'stands' for?
 
If that can be true, then what consequent implications does that
endorsement have for those values which he 'embodies'.? Do GAP realise what
they're 'buying' into? Does Ginsberg have an ironic position with regard to
what he's selling? Is there some intimation of a Faustian pact? Is he
selling his, and others', pasts - or a generative (even some might add
congenital) bohemian undergraduate lifestyle - or a set of ideologies and
cultural values? In other words if the production and the producer of
'Wichita Vortex Sutra' is 'good' for sales how does or can that affect the
reception and critiques of his work as a poet?
 
What is lost? What is gained? What can be reclaimed and on what basis?
 
Can the (sometimes) desperate need for societies to embrace and absorb
resistance beyond (either internally or externally) accepted margins or
consensual realities reach a point of untenable, or no longer sustainable,
flexibility? Is this another strategy for bringing the bourgeousie to its
brink?
Can a crisis in capitalism be brought about by encouraging it to stretch
too far? (the weasel notices he's way beyond the canyon's edge  -  claws at
thin air before speed lines plunge him out of the frame towards the rapidly
approaching stream in the canyon's bed)
 
And to pick up Ron's point about large audiences and the rock axis, hasn't
much of Ginsberg's career openly engaged with businesses bigger than the
small press?
What price the intergrity of Rolling Thunder  -  or Dylan himself for that
matter? Aren't Ginsberg and Dylan already part and parcel of the Capitalist
fabric of the American dream? I enjoy you teasing these threads apart once
more but can't we begin to develop other strategies rather than the binary
'them' and 'us' oppositions.
 
Doesn't all business involve forms of reification by association with
success? Like having a commendation from x on the back of the book  -  or
merely being able to publish something written by x to raise the profile of
a press. Whilst, arguably, Consumerism can't be separated from
Dissemination it isn't synonymous with Capitalism. This list and e-space
more generally has a crucial role to play in developing new relations
between process and product, between means of production and modes of
consumption between forms of communication, information distribution and
ecologies of use.
 
I appreciate what you posted a week or so back re; the hallmark of a great card:
 
>The books my wife Marta & I publish include all of the "bullshit,"
>*despite* my sense that it somehow "cheapens" the things.
>Dissemination--almost all of it, at any level--involves some degree of
>compromise. It helps, I think, if you can be consistently aware of that,
>know beforehand what you are or are not willing to do.
 
There is NO clean money."It's not YOUR money creep, it's MONEY!". There are
huge socio-economic arguments massing and missing here. Alongside which lie
various reductive ideologies re- mainstream and margin -
 
     'precious tempered formal radicals
      cleaving to illusory
      obscurity, that being the only
      security they've got' (slim pickens)
 
cris
 
p.s. In 1990 I was invited to interview Ginsberg on censorship in the U.S.
re Helms and radio 'chilling'. Didn't know what he'd be like 'in person'.
I've got to say that warts and all he struck me as to quote you one last
time 'a great card'  -  flawed but then who isn't, and full of the energy
to engage  -  the roughness of the public worlds. He 'hits on' those.

Dear Cris:
 
Many thanks for your truly thoughtful & hilarious post. (Great Slim Pickens
quote, btw. What's it from?) Yes, yes; that "us" & "them" is too, too
easy. (My "Windbag" sign-off not just an acknowledgment of my
talkativeness, but, as it comes from More's _Utopia_, a nudge suggesting
how ridiculously idealistic I can get, to boot.) (I'm not completely
oblivious, though I play ... , etc.)
 
I have friends who feel that small presses in general suffer from just
what that Pickens quote brings up--there are many days when I
wholeheartedly agree (& include myself in that, too, btw.) Still, I think
you can talk yourself into & out of believing anything, & to quote from
something a friend writes (about-to-be, but-not-yet-published) about Olson:
 
"He knew and taught that where there are no standards there can be, really,
no love."
 
Yours, w/respect

Subject:      Re: Chapbooks at EPC
 
appologies in advance to more Web experienced folks, but--
 
 
just wanted to add encouragement to folks considering contributing
to the EPCs electronic text, and to echo Loss's charaterization of
this as a pretty special opportunity...
 
to expand a little on HTML, which is the language used to write
World Wide Web documents:
 
HTML (HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)
is _much_ less intimidating than it sounds, even fr technophobes
like me--not much more complicated than MLA manuscript conventions...
*(no, really!)*.  basically, it's a set of tags that describe how
a text is presented onscreen...
 
-----
 
now, here's the above paragraph in HTML:
 
<p>
<H1>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</H1>
is <i>much</i> less intimidating than it sounds, even fr technophobes
like me--not much more complicated than MLA manuscript conventions...
<b>(no, really!)</b>.  basically, it's a set of tags describe how
a text is presented onscreen.
 
the "<p>" means "new paragraph"; the text between "<H1>" and "</H1>"
will be displayed as a first level heading, like a title; "<i>much</i>"
means that "much" will be displayed in italics; "(no, really!)" will
appear in bold...  all of these tags are hidden when the document is
read onscreen, the computer just interprets them & displays the text
as specified...
 
 
besides online resources, there's a book available, "Teach yourself
Web Publishing with HTML in a Week" by Laura Lemay--broken down into
"day 1", "day 2"... and all the basic text-oriented stuff is covered
by day 3.)
 
-----
 
in addition to formating, HTML allows you to jump between different
"pages" of your document, either in a specified sequence or as a
web of interconnections.  simple ways of using this would be a table
of contents, where each title is linked to it's respective poem--
the reader "clicks" on a title onscreen, and that poem is then
displayed.  another use would be footnotes that are hidden, and only
displayed at the request of the reader...  and again, the
actual formatused to specify these links is really simple...
 
 
which brings me to my real point, to encourage folks to utilize
the possibilites of the medium (& harkening back to recent discussions
about the physical design of books).  when i design a paper chapbook,
i work pretty hard to sequence the poems so that the book as a
whole "flows".  with links that aren't necessarily linear (pg 1,
pg 2 etc), whole new schemes are possible.  for my initial
chap for the EPC, i'm working with the poet--from any given poem,
she's suggesting 3 or 4 other possible poems that might make
good "segues", readers will be able to jump to any one of them
from there... and instead of a straight table of contents,
she's gonna write a new piece, sort of a letter amoung her
various "selves", which will have links (allusive/suggestive,
rather than simply the titles) into the various poems...
 
 
i've been working with Loss for the past coupla weeks, figuring
out from scratch how this stuff fits together--he's made things
very easy.  i'd be happy to offer my meager experience to any of
you considering taking him up on this offer.

Of course, sure, Ginsberg often hits on young guys. He never denies
that--in fact, mentions it from time to time. What is he supposed to
do: hit on old guys? If the young guys are smitten by fame, well,
Allen isnt going to make them pay for it.

     Excerpt from _Dark Decade_ (relevant to a number of threads here,
recent & not-so-recent):
 
     THE POET'S CONDITION
     His aesthetics were fed by linguistics, not ecstacy, and he banked on
the gestures of middle class life. He matched his chairs with the
diningroom table while the computer continued its printout unsupervised.
Children dropped into the picture in their requisite role as accessories
of the age. The macho tactics that had launched his embryonic career also
catapulted themselves into the domestic arrangements.
     The expectations of a whole generation of forbearers stood ahead of
him in the path to glory. The high stakes were all low paying, gambling
for the dubious slots in history, and the strategies of youth had all been
Oedipal -- taking on masters and then taking aim. What was poetry in this
moment but a marginal commentary on a marginal form, smudged against the
hallmark of literature, and sleeping undisturbed between the covers of
slim volumes? . . .
     Dyna is not part of this picture, but is also ready to be described.
She begs for pulp terms to break the taboo against violence to women with
the glandular vocabulary of the super-market novel. Her moments lend
themselves to sensationalism. She lives the very antithesis of the obscure
literary genre. Hers is a popular mythological tale, full of glamour,
gloss and textural attributes. But feeling correct and circumspect we
merely indicate the presence of a woman.
     The poet, meanwhile, has made it to the kitchen where he takes a hunk
of bread and begins to live with it. Frustration spreads itself with the
knife of anticipation -- later. Later. The refrain stings his soul,
against the strange injustice of a world unwilling to acknowledge the
power of the word in its own climate: language. The bread bit into him and
we lost the opportunity for elaborate development of character or scenes:
while the angel of mercy reserved the loaf along with the goals, aims, and
standards that the poet, in a better mood, maintained. In our story he
represents the state of fallen virtue and the failed project of art.
     The times would gladly obliterate his existence, but we notice that
they do not bother. . . .
