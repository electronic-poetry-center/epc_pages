AUSTRALIAN WRITING ONLINE is a small press distribution service which we    
hope will help Australian magazines, journals and publishers to reach a     
much wider audience through the internet. As a first step we will be    
posting information and subscription details for a number of magazines and  
publishers to a number of discussion groups and lists. We hope to build up  
a large emailing list which includes as many libraries as possible. If you

Overland, Australia's radical nationalist literary quarterly, continues to  
be edited by John McLaren and published with the assistance of the      
Victorian University of Technology (VUT). Overland is Australia's second

Southerly the first established, but not continuous.

August and November, so avoiding the plethora of journals that appear at the    
end of each quarter.        
    
Its Summer 1995 issue includes Boc Burns on Peter Carey, John Ridland on an 
American discovering Australia, and the best fiction and poetry currently   
available--as well as an unparalleled helping of review of recent fiction,  
poetry. history and politics.       
    
The February issue will feature fiction noire, reviews on the failure of the    
revanchist right and tough left, and all the other social and political     
issues ignored by our reptile contemporaries.   
    
You can subscribe now for $28 (Aust) for four issues--academic articles are

   Dear Ira--Okay, that would be cool if you moved here by me. What     
   would you do for "a living" though? I wish I could help you find     
   a job here. Maybe you could apply to the school here as a student.   
   That's what I'm doing (thanks to the student loan sharks). I'm sorry     
   to have been so negative about America or specifically Albany but when   
   your post came through I had just been informed that Elizabeth's husband,    
   Jeff Hansen, is not getting rehired at his job at the "boy's academy"    
   here and the economic pressures that are severely affecting this town    
   right now. Nonetheless,this is where i live. Anyway, if you're serious   
   about this I could send you more info--perhaps off this list...Chris S.

Here's more stuff that I pulled off of the House of Representatives page    
on the WWW. Cunningham has been in Congress for 4 years. Here are the   
bills he has been the principle author of so far this congress. Except  
for what looks like a "local green" bill in there, the rest have a      
distinct reactionary flavor. Especially HR 220. Note his cosponsors.    
(Doolittle, who shows up more than once, is a rightwinger from the      
Sacramento area. Is anyone on this list from UC Davis?) If you have a   
congressperson who is listed on one of those bills, you might want to   
call his/her office and ask what they can do to influence Cunningham to     
get his committee (a subcommittee of the Economic and Educational   
Opportunities committee of the house) to report out a bill that     
authorizes the NEA.         
    
Remember--from this point of view, it's unimportant whether or not he   
supports its funding. In fact, if he wants to vote against any      
appropriation, that would not be a killer. Authorization, tho, might be.    
    
I will try to find out stuff on timing in the days ahead.

Dear Tom, My statements about theory/practice were not just replies to  
you. They had a context too, which it seems you're not entirely     
attending. But I don't want to fight about it. I'm sorry if it seemed I     
was not appreciating all the wisdom and clarity of your thought.    
I'm sorry if my words were to you "no reaction at all." In the future   
I'll try to do better, because it's clear that you're one of the most   
important voices on here, and your judgments are crucial.       
Yrs, Spencer Selby      
P.S. Whatever the context, I don't believe "this discourse proceeds at  
the level of the poetry."

Subject:  Re: Re- CALL FOR A DECISIVE   
    
Bill,   
    
Thanks for your encouragement of my Jung elaboration. I'm not sure that     
this list is the place for opening out all the aphorisms/points I made;     
I just hoped it might circulate the manifesto to generate some connection   
with the similar minded.        
    However, I always answer specific questions. Stockhausen is a   
European composer of similar age and period to Cage; Stockhausen uses   
some process and chance, but he has also periodically stopped to ask    
what he has learned from his chance works, and has always also composed     
very carefully chosen work. My point in my manifesto was simply to allege   
that a lot of poets want to call themselves *musical* because they get  
Cage, or free jazz, as a theoretical gesture, but not as a physical     
experience of sound. That poets allied to Zukofsky think he and therefore   
they are musical when Zukofsky may namecheck Bach, but is a million miles   
further away from Bach than, for example, Pound, in understanding how to    
balance and combine cadences and sound, or how to do counterpoint. To take  
one example, Pound's use of monosyllables in the early Cantos is, it seems  
to me, a technical feat as difficult as musical composition; by his careful 
sense of context, dialect and etymology he places words in his poetry so    
that they interrogate and are interrogated by other words and lines     
*both rhythmically (picking up certain assonances) and semantically     
(looking at what the word might mean and has meant)*; this creates a kind   
of counterpoint, or slowing of time, as the mind remembers previous words   
and lines and mentally plays them in a kind of double-exposure; just as,    
when listening to Bach, one can hear phrases recur but in reverse or a  
different octave, and one thus hears phrases inside each other. If you  
then look at how Zukofsky uses monosyllables in the opening sections of     
"A", you find not remotely the same complexity (it's as if he's trying  
to copy the surface of Pound without understanding the structure).      
    Cage wanted to use randomness in order to defy connections with     
the past, to be new in that way. Stockhausen manages a similar break    
but also stands equal with past composers, creating equivalent *complexity* 
by balancing not so much phrases but cadences, working not in time and  
rhythm but physical space. I can't describe it better than that; I juts     
just get a huge sense of space, with a sound coming from above, then left,  
then throughout the whole space. Cage wanted to get his audience to feel    
space, eg 4'33", but Stockhausen can actually sculpt it.        
    
See how long it might take to spell everything out?         
    
Best

Stockhausen (Karlheinz) is a german composer, founder of the    
"cologne" school ov electronic music--based in the studios of       
radio cologne, very generally using electronic sound sources    
(oscillators etc.) as opposed to manipulating found sound       
a'la the french muisque concrete school.  altho he & cage       
did at some points clash over theory, i believe they "patched       
things up" (no pun inteneded, ov course) later, and the german/     
french opposition now seems more genuine, at least to me.       
    
dunno, maybe some folks think of cage & his zen influence as    
warm & fuzzy, and diametric to a perception of stockhausen's    
cold hard "classicism"--readings of both that _i_ find misleading...

The theories and practices of the poets of whom you speak evolved in a  
series of books from the early 1970s through the current decade's books     
by several of the poets. Anthologies such as *Inthe American Tree*      
edited by Ron Silliman and *From the Other Side of the Century* edited  
by Douglas Messerli will give you good samplings of some but not all of     
the poets involved. *The Language Book* edited by Bernstein and     
Andrews (Southern Illiois University Press), *The New Sentence* by Ron  
Silliman (Roof Books), *A Poetics* by Charles Bernstein, *The Boundary of   
Blur* by Nick Piombino (Roof Books), portions of my own *Our Nuclear    
Heritage* (Sun & Moon), and a raft of others by Barrett Watten, Alan    
Davies, and forthcoming by still others such as Hank Lazer will articulate  
the variety of concerns that were addressed by these poets over the years.  
Someone might want to cite the secondary texts which have the purpose of    
"summarizing" the works, but I find these less useful since they    
translate the mechanisms by which the poets meant and thereby are only  
descriptive. Bernstein has a good list of these texts about these poets. But    
the point that must be made regarding your query is that the only simplified    
material that can be written would be similar to the promotional    
literature which was generated to alert librarians and readers to the   
presence of tendency in writing. Such promotional literature can't be   
used to articulate anything other than the marketing practices of   
publishers such as Messerli, Ganick, Bernstein & Andrews, and myself. So    
there probably is no short answer and most ofthe poets who participated     
in these writings and publications would prefer that they be allowed to     
represent themselves when you read them each, not as a lump, since the  
poets of whom we speak are as diverse as all the other tendencies   
combined and sought another mode of presentation.       
    
So rather than a        
summary, I, for one, would ask you to take a look at some of the work.

philosophy, sparrows, things to eat     
or just friction)       
    
2)  Picking up Spencer's gauntlet:      
    
Teaching in Japan I have had to learn all kinds of tricks for getting   
silent people to talk, to break their internal barrier against speaking     
even if they feel they have nothing to say or are afraid of making a    
mistake.  Techniques include sentence completion, anonymous bulletin    
boards, teaching gambits for evoking speech to the interlocutors of a   
silent person, giving participation points, and listening intently to a     
usually quiet one who gets up the nerve to speak.   I wonder if these   
techniques could be adapted to a poetry commmunity, and by extension to     
any democracy. FILL that air.       
    
    
By the way it was very hard for me to post this.        
Ashamed that my teeth might be part of my skeleton I was obliged to     
first blacken them then cover them with my hand.        
    
What is the level of the poetry, Spencer?  Who stratifies all this      
language?   
    
I'm thinking of applying to Buffalo.  I'm in e-mail contact with Ben F.,    
but would like to hear from others involved in that community about what    
it's like.

_exactly_.  the short version is so easily misunderstood as to      
be useless fr anything but agitation.  the expanded version     
gives me a point of entry, might be part of a dialogue (&       
not just a harangue).  and the problem, fr me, w/ much of       
what passes here, on these screens, is the time wasted on       
agitation.  by which i refer back to the earlier M thread,      
where the stance of the intro completely obscures...        
response to the slogans seems pointless (haven't you ever       
been called names before?), but, i believe, there is some       
substance behind their practice (&/or praps related--who        
mentioned CHAIN o*blek 12 etc?), which remains unaddressed      
and still worth addressing...

others who took the time to expand their replies to "account" (or at

REGISTERS/ (PEOPLE IN ALL) by Clark Coolidge    
88 pages        ISBN 0-939691-10-8      $9.95   
    
Written between May '89 and August '92, these fifty sections of 3-line  
stanza/chords continue Coolidge's fast-forward drive to explore how     
sheets of sound can be made to echo thought itself:         
    ." . . . Off where      
nerves rattle and glance interminable, the sphere of the bygone     
syllable. Lit as if sound, a cascade to a bell."        
    
(OUTSIDE) by Todd Baron     
88 pages        ISBN 0-939691-11-6      $9.95   
    
"Todd Baron's poems in (OUTSIDE) have a clarity that is not being   
either speech or thought while seeming the reverberation of 'the    
public' from inside 'someone,' "not lines or rhythms or even/ anything  
from the outside but on paper from the voice above the water-level/     
shouting something beneath." The sense of the poems' shape crosses a    
spatial line or level they make that is public/interior." Leslie    
Scalapino

Recent Titles

Amblyopia  by Jena Osman        
48 pages        ISBN 0-939691-09-4      $8.00   
    
"Amblyopia is an invitation to a new architecture, where spaces are     
construed with artifacts of the mindQfavorite haunts, obscure       
discoveries, longings, persons and objectsQas well as vital responses to    
the habitat it creates. Each gesture leaves a trace "representing a kind    
of revolution or paragraph on a relatively fragile topic." The writing  
is precise and lush. That we get to follow Jena Osman into her theatre  
of invention is an exhilirating pleasure of the first order." Ann   
Lauterbach  
    
Second Law  by Elizabeth Willis     
64 pages        ISBN 0-939691-08-       
$8.95   
    
"Elizabeth Willis's work is a wonder: an open tangle of thought, a mark     
in the darkness, a sudden projection: 'striving between light/ and the  
force of a body/ that is light.' These poems draw amazingly delicate    
boundaries among the soul's constellations of ambiguities." Beverly     
Dahlen  
    
Linen Minus  by Susan Gevirtz       
64 pages        ISBN 0-939691-07-8      $8.00   
    
"'Who wants? / Who walks? Who wants to walk?' When is repetition a kind     
of answer? 'The word ignites.' Read the work ignites. Repetition forms  
the answer, but what kind of answer? What kind of repetition? Gevirtz's     
transformations are unexpected progressions. Deliberate progressions    
roll internal rhyme into chords of the marvelous, into rhythmic     
visibility, flaunting precognition, pluralizing it. Progressions enact  
sensuous form, defer seams, reach unexpected grammatical conclusions.   
Restating progressions ritualize. Action thrills meaning among this cast    
of secret agents. 'I defy you.'"  Norma Cole

Dear Nada,  
Hello, I'm very glad you jumped in.     
I hope my statements have not been taken as being in any way against    
anyone's wish or need to speak out on anything. This forum seems very   
open (maybe even "wide open"), which is one of the best things about it.    
I might remind you though, that what is pleasurable for the speaker may     
not be for part or all of the listeners.    
As for what the level of poetry is, I'm not going to try that one.      
Poetry/art has its own level, and whatever it is or may be, it is not the   
same as theory or criticism or writers' discourses or internet exchanges.   
This view may strike some as extreme, simplistic or old-fashioned, but I    
think it's dangerous when artists or critics start saying (or building  
contexts in which) their discourse is on the same level as the art.

Subject:  Still Espousing       
    
    Many books have been destroyed, carelessly or by design.  Lost,     
burnt, forgotten, volumes drop out of existence, along with--more easily    
disposed of--proofs never pulled, unpublished manuscripts, notes for books, 
plans and proposals for things to be written, collected, put into books.    
The number of projects unaccomplished in history must be enormous.      
    And much larger, almost infinite, the realm of projects     
unattempted, never started, what no one ever thought to do.     
    
    (Keith Waldrop, *Potential Random*).    
    
on the other hand I am not going to espouse any short stories in which  
    
lawn mowers clack.      
    
    (James Schuyler, "Freely Espousing")    
    
    
    
With apologies for the delay, here are some field reports from *Freely  
Espousing* events last weekend.  After taking a few days to recuperate (and 
to change from our archaic e-mail software to Eudora), Jennifer and I want  
to re-issue our invitation to work with anyone who has ideas on how to  
sustain momentum, broaden the support-base, and provide an alternative  
voice (where stategic) to the rampant "bottom-line" thinking currently  
pervading both sides of the national debate on the Arts.        
    
The disastrous equation of corporate economic interests with the national   
interest is not our only option here!   
    
*San Francisco*         
    
On Friday evening, January 27, Kevin Magee and Myung Mi Kim had about three 
dozen writers to their home to discuss two anthologies, *writing away here* 
and *The New Coast.*  The site is significant: Small Press Traffic, which   
might have been in other times a 'natural' place to stage an event such as  
*Freely Espousing,* was losing its lease effective Jan 31.  Some of the     
writers gathered at Myung and Kevin's had composed "documentary gestures"   
(meant to link the NEA issue to the broader social war) earlier in the  
week: these were faxed to Providence and Buffalo the following morning.     
Kevin reports that the NEA was "there as a pressure" throughout an evening  
devoted to opening a dialogue between otherwise segregated "traditions" in  
American poetry.        
    
=46ollow-up:  An audio-tape was made of the evening's discussion. Kevin and 
Myung have written a brief report of their event for the forthcoming    
*Poetry Flash,* where it will appear in the context (we presume) of a piece 
Jennifer and I are preparing on *Freely Espousing* more generally.      
    
    
* Providence *  
    
Organized by Jennifer Moxley and Steve Evans with support from C.D. Wright  
and    the Ad-Hoc Council of Literary Presses.  
Salomon Hall 101, Brown University 3-7pm    
Estimated attendance: 175-200 people throughout the day     
=46ormat: Marathon reading of NEA-supported literature & Featured Speakers  
    
Speakers:   
Ray Rickman (Host of Bestsellers on Channel 36/PBS and Former RI State  
Representative), Representative Jack Reed (D-RI), Michael Harper (Poet,

Press Coverage:         
"Freely Espousing lets you speak up for the arts," by Jim Seavor,   
Providence Journal-Bulletin, 27 Jan 95: D1. 
"Writers gather in Providence to fight cuts in Endowment," by John      
Castellucci in Providence Sunday Journal, 29 Jan 95: B-3.

Daily Herald, 30 Jan 95: 1+     
"Gaurding Access to Art," Providence Phoenix, 3 Feb 1995: 3.    
    
Comments: The event was a qualified success--it generated important     
publicity, mobilized key defender's of the arts, and lead to local      
alliances that have developed throughout the week following the event.  The 
video-tape Lee Ann Brown made will come in handy in the next weeks and  
months.  We're currently slated to participate in a forum of the broad  
implications of the *Contract on America* for Rhode Island (16 Feb).    
    
    
* New York City *       
    
Organized by Jeff Hull with support from Brenda Coltas      
Parish Hall, St. Mark's Poetry Project 3-6pm    
Estimated attendance:50     
=46ormat: Letter-writing and brief program of speakers.  Event followed a   
reading by Kate Rushin at the Ear Inn.  
    
Jeff estimates that 70 longhand letters and 150 postcards were generated at 
the event itself.       
    
Speakers: Anne Burt of the Literary Network, Elizabeth Murray, others.  
Attended: Bruce Andrews, Ron Padgett, Eliot Katz, Alfred Corn.      
    
=46ollow-up: Discussion of future events focused on moving beyond the   
strictly literary set.  More as it develops.    
    
*Buffalo*   
    
(what follows is taken from an e-mail Jena Osman sent us earlier today)     
    
The Buffalo version of the "Freely Espousing" event was re-dubbed "SAVE     
THE artWORLD."  This event was not focused so much on the writing community'=   
s   
relation to the NEA, as it was on the many arts programs in the city which  
depend on federal/public funding; music, theater, visual arts, arts educatio=

programs, etc.  The event was organized by myself (Jena Osman), with help fr=   
om      
Anjanette Brush (director of Big Orbit Gallery), sponsored by the National  
Association of Artists' Organizations, and took place in the newly built cin=   
ema     
in the Hallwalls Center for Contemporary Arts.  Outside the cinema, in the m=   
ain     
gallery, were computers and printers set up for letter writing, tables of   
photocopied articles and info. about the NEA, books by NEA authors for sale 
from Talking Leaves Bookstore, food, talk, and the current Hallwalls member'=   
s   
show up on the walls.       
    The day consisted of a mixture of speeches and artistic presentation=   
s.      
Vincent O'Neill of the Irish Classical Theatre Company gave a dramatic readi=   
ng      
of a section of his one-man show on the work of James Joyce, "Joyicity."    
Eighth graders from public school 45 read poems and stories that they had   
written with local writers from Just Buffalo Literary Center's      
Writers-in-Education program.  Manny Fried, a local playwright and labor    
activist, read from his play "The Dodo Bird."  Film-maker Tony Conrad showed    
two films side by side--one purportedly made before he received an NEA grant=   
,   
one made after he received an NEA grant.  Susan Howe read poems by Wilfred  
Owen.  Raymond Federman read an excerpt from a novel which he had written wi=   
th      
the help of NEA support.  Random Axe, a band consisting of cello, banjo and 
guitar, played a short set, and the 12/8 Path Band played some socially     
activating tunes as well.  Other participants included Ed Cardoni of Hallwal=

    It's been estimated that over 200 people spent some time at the even=   
t,      
and all three TV stations showed up, two of them covering the story on the  
6-o-clock news.  Many letters were written, and many LitNet action cards    
signed.  A primary target of the letter-writing campaign was Representative 
Jack Quinn of District 30, a Republican who is perceived as a potential swin=   
g   
vote in favor of the NEA.  I believe the event was fairly successful at     
informing the community how NEA cuts will directly impact accessibility to t=   
he      
arts in Buffalo.  However, I think everyone realized that this event marked 
only the beginning, and hopefully those who attended are already thinking of    
what needs to be done next.     
    
    
*Washington*    
    
Organized by Joe Ross and Mark Wallace  
Willow Street Gallery, 1-5pm    
Estimated attendance: 40 (on a snowy day)   
=46ormat: Open Reading with brief program of speakers.      
    
Speakers included Alexander Ooms and Cliff Becker (both from the NEA).  
Attended: Tina Darragh, Peter Inman, Tom Mandel, Joan Retallack, Beth   
Joselow, Rod Smith and others.      
    
=46ollow-up: Joe writes "To sum it up: positive, good feeling of purpose,   
left us ready to do more."      
    
    
* San Diego *   
    
Organized by Craig Foltz and Cole Heinowitz 
The Wicki Up, 1-6 pm        
Estimated Attendance: 50-75 people      
=46ormat: Marathon Reading with Featured Speakers.      
    
Performance/Symposium: On the History, Present, and Future of the NEA.  
    
Speakers/Readers:  Quincy Troupe, Michael Davidson, Miguel Algar=EDn (poet, 
founder of Nuyorican Cafe), Pasquale Verdicchio, Eloise Deleon (Performing  
Arts Director at the Centro Cultural de la Raza), Deedee Haleck (Paper  
Tiger Video and TV), Rae Armantrout, Fanny Howe, Mel Freilicher (writer and 
former co-chair of Sushi Performance Gallery), Jerome Rothenberg, Harold    
Jaffe, Maggie Jaffe, Ralph Lewin (California Council for the Humanities),   
Rand Steiger (Director of the Ph.D. in Music at UCSD, former director of LA 
Philharmonic).  
    
Press: When we spoke to Cole on Sunday, coverage in the next day's SD Union 
seemed likely (can anyone vouch for that?). 
    
=46ollow-up: About 10-12 people stayed after and forged a short agenda for  
the coming week.  Discussion focused on broadening network to include SD    
Symphony, Escondido Arts Center (in Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham's      
district),etc.

There might be some agitation, but it seems healthy.   Poets on the whole   
tend to be rather annoying.     
    
Another tack, however, might be to discuss things in the world that are     
influencing the art, obsessions.  I enjoyed eric pape's spirit story more   
than recent theoretical calls to the M.     
    
Lately, I've been staring at high tension towers to get "inspiration."  
I've even taken to rendering them in photoshop.  I can't articulate why     
I'm obsessed with power lines, but it/they continue to drive the work.  
    
Perhaps this tack is too individualistic to have meaning to a large group.  
 But I am more interested in learning new methods of doing good work--  
how to get new obsessions--than in discussing the correct way to write.     
    
I'd be curious to know what motivates others.

GOVERNMENT BY IRRITATION        
    
 Government by irritation: it's one of the dominant political   
modes of our day. Taking their cue from talk show hosts,        
politicians try to topple their opponents by unleashing discontent.     
These days the NEA serves as a handy source of annoyance if not     
outrage: a few well-publicized examples of troublesome art have,    
over the last few years, been able to furnish a great supply of     
instant political energy.       
 It's not easy to argue against such energy. The value of art   
is not always instantly apparent--and at the same the difficulties      
art brings with it are much more likely to be perceived at a    
glance. The latest remarks by senators that the NEA be abolished    
unless it supports "family values" show how true this is.       
 Rather than arguing for art that is familiar, obedient and at      
best ornamental, I think case that art is valuable to the community     
precisely because it is not perfectly predictable or obedient. That     
will not mean that unruly art is automatically wonderful. Art is    
one of the testing grounds between individuals and the community.   
The point is that it's an opportunity for judgment: members of the      
community will need to make up their minds. That's one of the basic     
values of art: it can't be approached dogmatically.         
 If it's considered in terms of the federal budget as a whole,      
the NEA is hardly a big deal. The federal budget is around a    
trillion and a half dollars a year; the NEA budget is $167 million.     
If my math holds, that means that the NEA takes up about one ten    
thousandth of the federal budget. That's less than the military     
spends on marching bands, less than the city of Berlin spends on    
public art. 
 To eliminate the NEA would save each American 65 cents a year.     
Here in Philadelphia, dance, poetry, the visual arts, theater would     
all suffer; the gamut of organizations affected would range from    
the Institute for Contemporary Art to the Please Touch Museum, from     
the Philadelphia Orchestra to the Settlement Music School. The      
bigger, more established concerns would take a hit; some of the     
smaller organizations might have to close. Those who are out of     
sympathy with the arts might think that's fine: that if a theater   
company needs a handout to survive there's something wrong with it.     
But to consider the arts in such a framework is an unfair       
oversimplification.         
 For one thing, business itself is not treated in such a sink-      
or-swim way: government subsidies are an integral part of many      
industries, from farming to sports franchises. One of the better    
reasons for such subsidies is that they shield enterprises from     
momentary reverses. If farmers couldn't survive a single bad    
season, it would ultimately make for a weak social fabric. With the     
arts, the time frame is often more stretched out. It can easily     
take decades for general taste to approve of developments in art.   
The last hundred years are full of examples. In France painters     
such as Monet and Matisse were ridiculed by the majority of their   
contemporaries; there was a riot at the premier of Stravinski's     
"Rites of Spring." Of course, paintings by Monet and Matisse are    
now among the most valuable objects on the planet; and thirty years     
after it had driven listeners into a frenzy of disgust,     
Stravinski's music was used by Disney as the soundtrack to the      
dinosaur section of "Fantasia."     
 These are examples of successes. But it's not always the case      
that today's innovative art becomes tomorrow's classic. A 1920's    
symphony by George Antheil that used airplane engines has not yet   
become a cultural treasure (nor is it likely to). That's important.     
It misses the point to say "Fine, innovate, be creative. But only   
if you turn out to be Monet. No duds or wild excesses, please."     
 But why should the government have to underwrite art? Didn't   
Monet work on his own? There are a couple of answers to this. For   
one thing, a significant part of NEA money goes to community    
groups, often helping get art to groups and places it doesn't       
normally reach: smaller towns, rural areas, schools that don't have     
the resources for art programs. And for the government to cut all   
arts funding would mean that it recognizes no values other than the     
marketplace.    
 Under the reign of purely economic motives, there is no way    
anyone would want to produce something unless it could be sold      
immediately. Imagine a society in which every cultural product had      
to turn a profit instantly. If you want to get a sense of how       
claustrophobic this can be, consider how dominated commercial       
television by spinoffs and imitations.  
 Given how informative, exciting, and revealing the arts can    
be, what an important antidote they are to instant opinion polls,   
and how important they already are to various different parts of    
the community, I think they're worth 65 cents a year. The money is      
not wasted: people in the arts are appreciative of the little       
support they get and work hard whether or not they get it. By their     
very nature, the arts speak to the individual's judgment at the     
same time as they offer possibilities for building communities:     
they're perfect training for the independence and possible sense of     
connection that we need to live in a democracy. Maybe 65 cents is a     
bit low. Why not make it $1.30?

What, Jeffrey Timmons asks, constitutes a reaction to my view?      
Well, let me start by saying that I think I wrote in a bit      
too snippish way in my own response to you, Jeffrey.        
    
At the heart of what I said in the post to which you were responding was this:  
    
    "a discourse in re: poetry that is interesting to       
    poetry is one that adds space for poetry to be      
    made. Adds space."      
    
I want to hear someone discuss poetry with an emphasis on how work does its job 
in relation to the world it inhabits. The place of theory (even theory of   
poetry) with respect to poetry, to writing, is not that the theory resolves the 
work, as if you turn to the theory to help understand the work. Rather, theory, 
theoretical concerns or convictions operate as what Aristotle would have called 
"efficient causes"; they set a work, perhaps even a body of work, into motion,  
they get it going. You can't turn back to the theory, however, to understand    
the work itself - tho of course you can seek indications or intentions anywhere 
you find data to support them - and above all theory does not operate to    
justify the work. An acquaintance with the manifestos or even the ideas of  
surrealism is not necessary to understand Breton's _Nadja_. Might it not be 
helpful? It might be, to one or another reader; but, I could as easily imagine  
a reader to whom it would not provide entry to the work, even a reader whose    
response to the work would be dulled or diminished, dumbed out, by an attention 
to surrealistic theory (even more so to interpretations thereof).   
    
What then is a "discourse in re: poetry... that adds space for poetry to be 
made"?  
    
Anything that asks, or attempts to answer, that question is "a response     
to my view." Yours would be different from mine, and different from     
Charles Bernstein's. I recommend, because I did in the original post    
but without naming it, Mandelstam's "Conversation About Dante" as an    
example of what is in response to my view (i.e. I am in response to     
it - since, again as I had it in my original post, "a connection with the past  
[being] no different from a connection with the future.")

I'm having trouble laying hands on the Fernando Pessoa poem

Does anybody know this poem? It's only a handful of lines long,     
and if one of you cd quote it to the list, I'd be grateful.     
If not, I"ll find it sometime in the next week or so and        
pass it along when I do.

Dear Bob,   
    
Just a quick note to wish you luck with Saturday's event.  Jen      
and I were happy to learn of it and we read you op-ed piece with    
interest.   
    
Please let us know how it comes off (and I'll have my dad, who      
lives in S.Jersey, look for coverage on the local news).        
    
We're faxing a 4-6 pp. piece on Freely Espousing to Poetry Flash    
late Sunday night, so if you have any information about your    
event that you'd like us to include, get in touch with us &     
we'll try to work it in.  (This piece is pretty basis: After    
a rousing few words we'll be providing accounts of what     
happened in various places, stressing how such actions are      
relatively easy to organize, etc.).     
    
Again, we wish the best to yourself, Susan Stewart, and Gil Ott.    
May the skies cooperate!        
    
Yours,  
    
Steve Evans 
    
p.s. Have you seen the Douglas Davis article on NEA/NEH in the current *Art in  
America* ("Multicultural Wars," Feb 1995: 35-45)?  I just read it   
this afternoon & found it pretty useful, especially in its emphasis     
on the pitfalls of "conciliation."

Dear Tom,   
Excuse my blunder. Yr post was not addressed and it seemed you      
might be talking to me, or maybe both of us at the same time. I guess I     
was butting in without knowing it. I do have an interest in what you're     
saying to Jeffrey, and a disagreement, I'm afraid.      
I would say theory is, as such, no more positive in getting the work    
going than it is with understanding. In both cases it is a double-edged     
sword, just as dangerous or potentially destructive as it may be    
beneficial. Anything that attempts to ask or answer yr question (about  
adding space for poetry) is certainly a response, but whether that      
anything is successful, or more helpful than dangerous or destructive, is   
very much open to question.     
Formulated theory or knowledge may play a large or small role in an     
individual's creative life. Whatever the role, it is up to the      
individual, who cannot look to others for answers about this which may be   
necessarily correct.        
That's my reaction to yr most recent message to Jeffrey. Despite my     
disagreement, it struck me as quite interesting and provocative. Yr words   
are never blah blah blah to me. Which may be why I keep butting in.     
Yrs, Spencer Selby

    "Re: ERic Pape's "...spirituality cannot be faked,

    the Fernando Pessoa poem which begins (something        
    like) "The poet is a faker...." Does anybody know       
    this poem? It's only a handful of lines long,       
    and if one of you cd quote it to the list, I'd be

Pound: A work of art, any serious work vivifies a man's total perception

 Maybe we need to broaden our definition of theory to "a man's total    
perception of relations." Just a thought, a gesture towards an imagined     
point of opening.

I cant remember the details of the context in whixh Cienfuegos made     
his sharp comment on revolutionary art. I read an account in a      
Mexican newspaper (this a short time before C.'s plane disappeared),    
and I do remember that the contxt (for the newspaper story) was that    
Cienfuegos seemd to have Fidel's ear, and the hope was that the CP      
would not come along and impose its usual ban on Freud, surrealism,     
etc. I should have been a auto-clipping service at the time.

Subject:  Use da news 2     
    
I was happy to see Bob Perelman's Philadelphia Enquirer op-ed.  I think that    
op-ed pages may be as good a tool in this fight as contacting congressmen   
directly.  I've heard many like to sustain their illusions of *fingers on the   
pulse* through hometown papers.     
    
This is my column from the Milwaukee Journal, Friday, January 13:   
    
With the recent swing in Congree back toward Reagan-era conservatism has come   
a new attempt to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts.     
    
The NEA's budget isn't large, but its critics argue that any amount the     
government spends on the arts is too much, that funding the arts is not a   
legitimate function of government.  Gingrich, Helms and others make this    
argument despite the examples of other major world governments, nearly all of   
which make funds available to support art and artists, many at much higher  
levels than the U.S.        
    
 This simply highlights the fact that the main reason conservatives want to 
stop funding the arts is not to save money nor to keep government's purposes    
pure.  It is because new art is ultimately very dangerous to a conservative 
world-view.  Discouraging the production of non-commercial art in this  
country is consistent with other aspects of the conservative social agenda: 
school prayer, limiting women's reproductive freedoms, increasing the amount    
of capital in the coffers of America's richest citizens.  The arts produce  
work that is often far too critical of such a social agenda to make many    
friends on the Right.  These lawmakers want to silence voices of dissent.   
    
Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold sees their attempt in the proper perspective,   
as censorship.  I wrote him and several other Wisconsin lawmakers in the past   
few months to urge they support thet NEA.   Feingold responded, "I believe, 
as a free society, we need to protect diversity and encourage the exchange of   
ideas.  I regard some recent attempts to cut funding for NEA as attempts at 
censorship, and at silencing one part of this discussion."      
    
 This position is consistent with the principles upon which the NEA was     
founded.  At the inception of the NEA in 1965, Congress issued a defense of 
why governments should fund the arts.  In part, it read: "The world     
leadership which has come to the United States cannot rest solely upon  
superior power, wealth, and technology, but must be solidly founded upon    
worldwide respect and admiration for the Nation's high qualities as a leader    
in the realm of ideas and of the spirit."   
    
 It also read: "Democracy demands wisdom and vision of its citizens.  It must   
therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and    
the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever     
located masters of the technology and not its unthinking servants."     
    
 The NEA is most often reported in the press for scandals involving funding 
of controversial artists, such as the flap involving late photographer Robert   
Mapplethorpe a couple years ago.  But its programs support the arts in local    
communities as well.  This occurs both in terms of aiding local artists     
(individually or through local arts organizations) and in such things as    
helping fund performances by nationally known artists.  In my own area, I   
think of the readings at Milwaukee's Woodland Pattern bookstore, for example;   
poets and fiction writers of national stature would not regularly give  
readings to small audiences in Milwaukee, as they do today, without the NEA.    
 For people in your district, it might be the local orchestra or theatre, a 
travelling opera or ballet troupe.      
    
 I confess I am not a disinterested observer of this issue.  Last year I was    
awarded an NEA Literature Fellowship.  I take the grant seriously, as an    
investment in my talent, and I hope my future work merits this investment.  
 The myth of the artist whose vision remains pure despite economic      
difficulties is bogus; economics do force artists to quit making art and    
start making money.  I was close to giving up fiction writing when I received   
funding.    
    
But I had also benefitted as a citizen from the NEA for years prior to  
winning this fellowship.  I had attended NEA sponsored readings, theatre and    
concerts; I had read writers and seen work by artists who had their own     
careers supported by the NEA; I had enjoyed the benefits of local galleries 
and performance spaces which exist with the support of the NEA.  I happen to    
enjoy art that isn't commerical, that wasn't created to make money.  But even   
people whose interest in art extends no further than enjoying Hollywood     
movies should realize that even commercial artists owe a debt to serious,   
non-commercial art.  Art not made for money takes more risks, taps more     
untouched stores of imagination, and often introduces the ideas and images  
that mainstream artists develop for more popular tastes.  We all benefit from   
the NEA.    
    
 Art also can provide us with morality of a sort different than the Right   
defines it.  Not simply indulging in tired pieties, serious art, when   
critical of our institutions and our daily practices, can serve as the  
bell-ringer to wake up our national conscience.  Funding the arts helps     
foster voices of dissent, a necessity in a healthy democracy.       
    
But Helms, Gingrich and company aren't interested in good art or healthy    
democracy.  Nor is my congressman in Sheboygan, James Sensenbrenner.  He has    
voted to eliminate the NEA for the past four years.  He cites the same old  
cost arguments as the others.  But money is a cloak over the real issue: the    
critics of the NEA want to promote their own set of cultural values while   
discouraging debate and critique.  If money was the only issue, we would    
naturally expect Republicans to subject far more expensive weapons programs 
to the same cost-conscious scrutiny as they do the arts.        
    
For my part, I'd rather that someone abroad knew about my country because of    
American novels than because of American war technology.

Spencer,    
    I didn't think you'd butted in, not at all. Just wanted     
you to know I wasn't responding to something you'd articulated.     
There is no 3d position, outside the relation of person to what     
that person thinks, writes, reads, that can tell you if something   
is useful or not. The test is simple; if it's useful then it's      
useful. I.e. if an idea is provocative and allows one to        
work or enhances work, makes a new space for work then it's     
of interest. My caveat re: the Apexites (last mention) was      
that I was waiting for the impact of their ideas on work they'd     
do. Period. Natch, I have my own version of whther that's likely    
to be a positive impact, but that measures only its impact on       
me. After all, everybody knows I"m interested in _spirit_       
(whatever that is), only they faiiled to mention what kind;     
in my tradition there are 3 forms of spirit. And even this      
line of thought, I take to be an attempt to articulate and      
render a little more subtle the Xtian notions taken over        
from a rather simple-minded roman _paganism_ (no bettre     
wrod comes to mind), which is how you get humans who are        
also divine, virginity as a cool positive value in the      
religion, and other affairs of _spiritual_ value in that        
tradition which are to me... oh, I dunno would vulgar       
and primitive be acceptable words? Not to step on       
any toes or anything.       
    
that whole paragraph shd have some keyboard graphic for     
tongue in cheek and serious at the same time, what my       
father (sleeping with all of them tonite, in peace) used        
to call _ribbing on the square_ (no doubt a westside chicago    
piece of 1920's lingo).     
    
no one has the pessoa citation at hand? Lots of books at        
Buffalo...  
    
Shd we discuss the 3 kinds of spirit in the Jewish intellectual     
tradition? how'bout it Spencer?

It's odd what strikes one isn't it?  For me, among a host of "things,"  
old boxes, pieces of twisted and rusted metal I find along the rail road    
tracks by my house, the sound of the hummingbirds, grackles, doves,     
sparrows, and mockingbirds intermingling, the terrible noises I can make    
with my computer's sound processing software or my guitar . . .  these  
things turn up in my writing in various ways and without trying to reduce   
any of the plurality of the different expressions to single subject I   
would hazard that there is some shared set of concerns in each.  The idea   
of place--"The most in time is where you're meant to be"--has been of   
vital importance lately, trying to document the sense of being in a     
particular location; this takes its form in music by recording the sounds   
of a space of time--whatever happens in that time--and then layering    
these into juxtapositions of moments.  This has the benefit of      
inspiration and of craft.  I'd be excited to share some of these    
experiments with anyone, were they interested (send snail address).     
Anyway, I thought the question a good one as it raises the nuts and bolts   
(and philosophical attitudes) of work and would like to continue with   
this ... but I've got to go now.  I'd like to take this to writing....

Thanks to Tom Mandel for elaborating his comments, they were much   
appreciated.  I must mull over the question of what provides space for  
poetry as it is worth a more detailed response than I am capable of at  
present.  Spencer can butt in any time, as far as I'm  concerned.  It's fun.

Subject:  BIG BROTHER is asking     
    
Folks,  
    
Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate      
Commerce Committee, recently sent a letter to the heads of the CPB,     
NPR, and PBS asserting that privatization/commercialization of      
public broadcasting was inevitable.  The letter demands information     
to incriminate public broadcasting as purveyors of leftist dissent      
and asks for financial data (to expedite commercialization).    
    
The Senator is angry at the CPB's meager attempts to protect itself     
by distributing information about the funding situation.  Pressler      
is not content to simply rail against Frontline for bias, P.O.V.    
(independent video) for bias, and American Playhouse for nudity and     
profanity, he also decries underwriters for influencing program     
content (how this will be solved by the introduction of completely      
deregulated market forces and advertising remains unclear to me).   
    
After Pressler's closed-door meetings with info-mogul Rupert    
Murdoch, a union shamefully under-reported, it now appears that     
expansion into the non-commercial bandwidth is the real prize for   
media conglomerates.  Once they're sold off they're gone for good,      
reclaiming them would be next to impossible.  This also sets a      
dangerous precedent for the net:  if public educational programming     
is pushed off the air, how much bandwidth can we expect will be set     
aside for free educational use if they get around to carving up the     
internet?   
    
If we sit by and shrug we'll get what we deserve:  a sea of     
informercials, complimentary copy, Howard Stern, and Power Rangers,     
in perpetuity.  I'll be posting a letter to download and send       
Pressler soon.  Please do something.    
    
I'm attaching an excerpted version of Pressler's questions.     
Credit where credit is due, he does manage to mention Paul      
DeMan and Barney on the same page.  If you'd like the full      
text e-mail me at v139hla3@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu; also, check

Dear Mr. Carlson:       
    
 Enclosed is a series of questions concerning the operation     
of public broadcasting.  In addition to responses to these      
questions, please include any documentation, memos, meeting     
notes, contracts and any other written material to substantiate     
the answers to these questions.     
    
 Please respond to these questions by February 10, 1995.    
    
 Thank you for your prompt reply.   
    
Sincerely,  
(signed by Sen. Larry Pressler)     
LP/dma  
    
All answers to questions should be substantiated with written       
materials, documents, memos, meeting notes, contracts, etc.     
    
5.   Please detail all efforts by recipients of CPB funds to    
 generate Congressional support for continued federal       
 funding:   
    
 a.   How much has been spent of this effort by all of public   
  broadcasting?     
    
 b.   How much has been spent to present the other side of      
  this controversial issue?     
    
 e.   Please list all news coverage and interview programs      
  and provide transcripts.      
    
 f.   Please explain how CPB has assured that this is       
  balanced and objective coverage.  
    
6.   Does CPB have printed guidelines for grant applications for    
 the program fund?  How are decisions made on which programs    
 to fund?  At what stage are considerations of balance and      
 objectivity brought to bear?  Please explain step-by-step      
 the processes involved.    
    
 d.   Some have suggested the lack of competition in public     
  television is due to anti-competitive practices at PBS.   
  How is CPB working to increase competition and monitor    
  collusion and pricefixing in public television?       
    
  2.) Please provide a list of controversial issues     
      covered by NPR and related programs.      
    
9.   Of CPB's total budget, why is only $4 million allotted to      
 the National Radio Program Production Fund?        
    
 e.   Document each one of last year's awards and indicate      
  how they fulfill your priorities to: 1) increase and/or   
  diversify public radio's audience, 2) yield quality       
  programming that is illuminating and inspiring as well    
  as appealing, and 3) seek programmatic innovation.    
    
 j.   Submit job descriptions of all 475 full time NPR      
  employees. Include gender, age, time of service,      
  salary, and ethnicity.    
    
 k.   Please submit a list of regular part-time employees.      
  Include gender, age, time of service, salary, and     
  ethnicity.        
    
10.  CPB provides funding to PBS's National Program Service.    
    
 c.   How are programs reviewed for objectivity and balance     
  prior to funding? Please describe the process in      
  detail. Does the CPB board participate in this process?   
    
 h.   How are political balance and diverse religious and       
  cultural perspectives represented?    
    
 i.   Does CPB keep racial and ethnic data to assure        
  compliance with EEOC directives? How does CPB ensure      
  against religious discrimination? Please provide a copy   
  of all guidelines.    
    
 j.   Some producers feel that their applications do not    
  receive full attention from CPB staff. Several months     
  ago, one producer submitted a documentary proposal    
  about the "United States Merchant Marine" to CPB      
  President Carlson, who wrote back to say that he had      
  passed it along to the programming department. The    
  producer never heard from CPB again.  
    
  1.) What was the disposition of the Merchant Marine       
      proposal?     
    
  7.) How many proposals does ITVS reject each year? Does   
      ITVS provide a list and description of rejected       
      proposals? If not, how can Congress provide       
      effective oversight without knowing what was      
      rejected, what was funded, and the reasons?       
    
  8.) Has ITVS rejected any proposals for a documentary     
      on the controversy surrounding literary critic Paul   
      DeMan, father of "deconstruction"? If so, please      
      provide complete documentation for this decision,     
      including panel comments.     
    
12.  What are the profit sharing provisions in CPB contracts with   
 producers and stations who derive revenue from CPB supported   
 productions?       
    
 a.   Please provide copies of contracts with producers and     
  copies of accounting for revenues and expenditures    
  related to CPB financed distributors including:       
    
      1.)  Children's Television Workshop, Inc.     
      2.)  New York Center for Visual History, Inc.     
      3.)  Public Affairs Television, Inc.      
      .         
      .         
      .         
    
  3.) What is the commercial value of the current public    
      broadcasting system. That is, what is the     
      comparative valuation of the hardware--satellite      
      transponders, transmitters, studio , etc.--and    
      software--library of programs belonging to system     
      producers, goodwill, etc.?    
    
  4.) Please list the top 100 salaries paid related to      
      public broadcasting. Include producers, vendors of    
      merchandise, and executives of companies whose    
      product is sold or displayed in public        
      broadcasting.     
    
  5.) What is the value of real estate, stock and bond      
      portfolios owned by public broadcasters and/or    
      their parent organizations. Please break this down    
      by station and include related production     
      companies.        
    
  6.) What would be the value of comparable commercial      
      time equivalent to that provided by public        
      broadcasting? Please provide a sample rate card for   
      public radio and television.  
    
13.  Some critics have complained that "underwriting for content"   
 is a form of payola or plugola.    
    
 a.   How does CPB ensure that underwriting has no influence    
  on programming?       
    
 d.   Should the National Science Foundation be permitted to    
  underwrite science coverage on NPR? Should it be      
  permitted to underwrite a series on exploration for       
  PBS?  
    
 e.   Please provide a list of underwriters and the content     
  area of programs they sponsor in public broadcasting.     
    
 h.   The National Education Association sponsors news      
  programming on NPR, for example. Does this create the     
  impression of impropriety, since the NEA also attempts    
  to influence legislation?     
    
 i.   NPR spends its own money and resources on lobbying    
  Capitol Hill. How does NPR keep its lobbying activities   
  separate from its news broadcasts? Please provide     
  documentation of the procedures.  
    
 m.   Doesn't the requirement for balanced and objective    
  coverage apply equally to the controversy over public     
  broadcasting funding?  If not, why not?       
    
 n.   What amount of money has CPB spent on any and all     
  advertising or promotion campaigns designed to increase   
  public support for public broadcasting?       
    
 o.   Has CPB ever spent any money on advertisements or     
  promotions raising questions about the management and     
  integrity of the public broadcasting system?      
    
 p.   How can CPB justify spending money in advertising or      
  promotions or money for only one side of the public       
  broadcasting debate?      
    
 q.   Please give a comparable market value for the air time    
  on PBS stations for the Hal Riney spots promoting     
  public broadcasting.      
    
14.  Some critics have complained that public broadcasting      
 provides promotional value for books and other products in     
 addition to educational services.  
    
 a.   Please list all books, records, CDs and other items       
  promoted on public radio and television since 1992 at     
  both a local and national level.  
    
 b.   Please list gross sales of these items, and analyze the   
  contribution public broadcasting exposure might have      
  had to their success.     
    
  1.) For example, what were sales of Armistead Maupin's    
      "Tales of the City" prior to the announcement of      
      the PBS series? And what were they afterwards? How    
      much money can one say Armistead Maupin made due to   
      sales of his book through PBS promotion?      
    
 c.   How are books, records, and CDs chosen for promotion on   
  PBS through related programming? Please describe the      
  procedures used in each case since 1992.      
    
    
15.  Some conservative producers have complained of PBS     
 executives giving them a hard time for ideological reasons.    
    
 a.   Please describe the changes PBS required in Michael       
  Pack's film "Campus Culture Wars" and give the reason     
  for each change. Were these types of editorial        
  oversight decisions made by PBS executives prior to       
  broadcast of "The liberators" and "Journey to the     
  Occupied Lands?"      
    
 b.   Please describe the changes PBS is requiring in the       
  second episode of "Reverse Angle" and the reasons for     
  each change. Were these types of editorial oversight      
  decisions made by PBS executives prior to broadcast of    
  "the Liberators" and "Journey to the Occupied Lands"?     
    
 c.   Please describe the changes PBS required in the recent    
  Ford Foundation-funded documentary about Community    
  Development Corporations. If no changes were required,    
  why not? How did this program meet PBS guidelines     
  designed to prevent underwriters from benefitting from    
  the subject matter of the programs they fund.     
    
 e.   Have John Dinges at NPR and Mary Jane McKinven at PBS     
  done a good job of assuring balance and objectivity in    
  programming? If so, why are there so many complaints?     
    
16.  What steps has CPB taken since Sen. Dole's speech on       
 "Barneygate" to participate in the profits of CPB funded       
 programs? Please provide specific examples and copies of       
 contracts.         
    
17.  Please provide a list of all political contributions over      
 $250 dollars made by individuals employed by or working    
 under contract for CPB-funded entities.    
    
22.  In 1992 Congress passed legislation requiring the CPB board    
 of directors to take steps to insure balance and objectivity   
 in programming, including the review of programs to identify   
 balance programs and the commissioning of remedial programs.   
    
 a.   How many programs did the CPB board review for balance    
  and objectivity from 1992 to present? 
    
 b.   How many programs were identified as having problems      
  with balance and objectivity?     
    
 c.   How many programs were funded to correct programs with    
  balance and objectivity problems? 
    
 d.   What procedures for review and commissioning of       
  programs to ensure balance and objectivity have been      
  established by the CPB board since 1992?      
    
 e.   When CPB director Vic Gold complained about       
  anti-semitic programming on a Pacifica radio station      
  funded by CPB, did the CPB board review Pacifica's    
  programming for balance and objectivity? If not, why      
  not?  
    
 f.   Without such a review, how can CPB assure Congress that   
  Pacifica stations are fulfilling community service    
  obligations under the public telecommunications act to    
  provide excellence, diversity, objectivity, balance       
  etc.?         
    
 k.   How does CPB insure stations provide balance and      
  objectivity in programming they produce and distribute?   
    
 l.   Has CPB ever denied funding to a producing station    
  because its productions were not balanced or objective?   
    
 m.   If so, which stations?    
    
 n.   If not, how did CPB determine productions from these      
  stations were balanced or objective?  
    
 o.   Has CPB ever denied funding to any station consortium     
  because of complaints programs were not balanced or       
  objective or for other reasons, since passage of the      
  1992 legislation?     
    
  1.) There have been complaints about Frontline from a     
      variety of groups and individuals.  Please provide    
      correspondence between CPB and the Frontline      
      consortium relating to issues of balance and      
      objectivity in consortium programming.        
    
  2.) There have been complaints about The American     
      Experience regarding programs, including "The     
      Liberators."  Please provide correspondence between   
      CPB and The American Experience relating to issues    
      of balance and objectivity in their programming.      
    
  3.) There have been complaints about American Playhouse   
      programming on grounds of profanity, nudity, and      
      indecency as well as questions of balance and     
      objectivity.  Please provide correspondence between   
      CPB and American Playhouse in this regard.        
    
 p.   Has CPB ever withheld funding from any other series or    
  production entity because of failure to provide       
  balanced and objective programming?   
    
  1.) There have been complaints about the P.O.V. series    
      and ITVS's objectivity and balance.  Please provide   
      copies of correspondence with P.O.V. and ITVS     
      relating to this issue.   
    
  2.) CPB director Vic Gold has inquired how a show     
      called "Don't Believe the Hype" will treat this       
      issue.  Please provide copies of correspondence       
      between CPB and the producers.    
    
 q.   Has CPB ever commissioned a program or series     
  specifically to balance an inadequate  program or     
  series?       
    
 r.   Has CPB ever required a producer, station, or

     NEW YORK (AHP) -- Despite all the glitz and glamour of New     
York's po-literati, authors and publishers were unable to stitch    
together the fraying fabric of the once-famous National Endowment   
for the Arts.   
     A cross-dressing fashion benefit called "Fidgety Spouting"     
nevertheless gave occasion for a poetry free-for-all that left      
participants wondering if it's all worth the effort.        
     James Sherry, Segue's CEO, lent his bowery loft space for      
the showings, and gave the poets permission to use a recently abandoned     
building near famed punk rock club CBGB's for dressing.     
     But the loft was too small to seat the long guest list, and the    
streets around CBGB's are no place for a ``signora'' to be walking,     
especially in mink and jewels.

     Even the cash bar offered by Sherry at the quickly planned     
romp was not enough to lift the spirits of the crowd, who fear the      
end of New York as a literary capital.  
     Gone are the heady days of the 1960s when Frank O'Hara, Joe    
Brainard and Jim Brodey dressed as Giulietta Masina, Audrey Hepburn     
and Sophia Loren, sipping drinks with the world's titled and wealthy.   
     Gone is Alice Notley, who single-handedly kept New York on the     
international lit map until she packed her bags for Paris.      
     The fashionable pack who swoop into Paris and Vancouver have   
long ago abandoned New York. So have many of the top younger poets,     
presumably because the local publishers don't have enough money to      
put out their books.        
     Despite their gratitude to Sherry, poets also lament the   
lack of a glamorous site for the readings. The Paris shows are at the   
Louvre.     
     Last but not least was the quality of the poetry on the    
Bowery runway. Except for a tiny few such as Bernstein, Lauterbach      
and Godfrey, the big names are gone. The field is left to       
little-known writers catering mainly to the Lower East Side

``slacker'' crowd.      
     ``What we have heard tonight was ugly self-indulgent lang-po   
dolled up with bridal gowns,'' said Rob Fitterman, who has helped   
run the Ear Inn series for several years.  ``Where is the music?''      
     Others were put off by the sameness of the verse.  ``The   
dresses showed more imagination than the poetry,'' said Paul Beatty,    
who recalled in his own outfit the chic touch of his Southern       
California origins.         
     Things got ugly when a restive Eileen Myles challenged the     
``girls'' to submit to a wet t-shirt contest. ``Ladies, ladies!''   
shouted a heavily made-up Bruce Andrews, ``Remember the '70s! Women's   
lib!''  
     If things don't change, says Fitterman, New York couture has   
``a maximum of two more years of life.''    
     For the next round of the ``Fidgety Spouting'' events, Sherry  
has promised some of New York's most famous outdoor spots such as   
Times Square and the Central Park Reservoir, already the site of the    
televised fashion gala, ``Donne Sotto le Stelle.''

In the original Greek use of the word theory, it was not opposed to     
praxis but to doxa (orthodox), so that theory related to the conduct of     
the individual life and doxa to social conduct and rites in society.    
Ref: Habermas. I have an extensive discussion of this in Our Nuclear    
Heritage where the concept of theoretical poetry is broached.

Just taking this opportunity at the mention of the poets of Canada to add   
to the list of poetry books addressing the subject of Language poetry   
from the Canadians:         
Alan Davies, *Signage* (Roof Books)     
Steve McCaffery *North of Intention* (Roof Books co-published in Canada     
by Nightwood)   
and Steve's issue of *Open Letter* called "Politics of the Referent"    
which was central to the process of "defining" language poetry for better   
and for getting it labelled, but Steve referred to it as        
"language-oriented" poetry (not the first time the phrase was used).    
    
If you want to know it's there to be found out.

You know Tom I wonder why with all this discussion of Apex, there have  
been no remarks from any of the signators which strikes me as what one  
person called Martini Terrorism or have they said it all in their   
magazine. Will you dance? If not, I suspect that the forum is too scrappy   
for a response which they would consider effective against the broadsides   
unloaded here. I too felt that when asked why I was interested in Lew's     
prose. I didn't want to expose my partially developed notions to the dogs   
of the net. How can we invite more varied response and still be able to     
say what we want. I mean it's fine for us to say what we think, but what    
about those of whom we are speaking? Jmaes

Well, of course I posted a manifesto because I wanted to flush out some     
fellow spirits, not engage in debate - if I'd had a hope of that, of course 
I'd have sent a longer message.     
    On a list where a really dumb message about aphasia can go out  
unchallenged - by people supposedly devoted to the politics of language     
definition - there ain't no shared values, and there ain't no space for     
civilised debate.       
    I do have one civilised question: can anyone sell me a copy of  
Barrett Watten's Progress? I love the library copy I have and want my own.  
Is it still in print?       
    A debating point, perhaps. In the American Tree is to my mind an    
astounding good piece of anthology editing - a very great book. This is why 
I have a lot of time for the comments Ron Silliman made on this list a  
while back about laissez-faire editing in the new poetry; he has cred on the    
subject. But editing is a big issue, alright: about how one looks at one's  
own work, and how one allows oneself to be theorised and institutionalised -    
the effort to influence this was what I love about the journals Poetic  
s Journal, and indeed L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.  
    So where'd it go? _From the Other Side of the Century_ is a terrible    
book, in my humble opinion - everyone represented by work referring to method,  
where Silliman represented writers by work either personally daring or  
descriptively oor energetically activating. From the Other Side is about a  
poetics as a style, a garment, a ticket to esteem, a movement got lazy, where   
In The American Tree is about a movement breaking free and finding method   
and setting new agendas. Well, if G1 won't keep to that spirit, G2 will,    
and of course you won't like it.

The death of Eric Mottram has shocked those who knew how energetic he   
was to the last week of his life. That this was so, will give pleasure  
to all those who never saw him otherwise in his 40+ years as a teacher.     
    
We will all have our particular memories. I lose count when I try to    
tally up the names of writers and titles whom I first heard of from     
Eric and who I cannot now imagine having "professed" American literature    
without having read. How DID he find out so fast? Eric was one of the   
original "networkers", who didn't need the electronic one. In fact, no  
"superhighways" for Eric (though they would fascinate him as a cultural     
phenomenon) - rather byways and the byways of byways, from which "probes"   
he would return with gold, frankincence and a lot of less salubrious    
matter. (He fell upon that McLuhan "probe" idea with a vengeance.)      
    
I also recall telling Eric about the political machinations I was learning  
about when I went to work at the Council for National Awards. We walked     
endlessly up and down a tennis court at Bulmershe (as was), I think it was. 
He was so distressed at what I was telling him - "the bastards! the     
bastards! - that I found myself cheering HIM up. What good medicine.    
    
I believe that King's is having a service for Eric on Friday 3 March.

To Martin Spinelli for putting Senator Pressler's document before us in all 
its inquisitorial splendor.  Perhaps we should be phoning his office and    
working through each of the questions with *his* staff?     
    
And also to Ted Pelton for forwarding his Jan 13 Op-Ed piece.  I am     
impressed by Rep. Russ Feingold's position: he says what too few arts   
advocates are willing to say.       
    
It is true, as Ted points out, that editorials from "hometown" papers are   
often entered by the Representatives into the Congressional Record as an    
indication of how their constituents (are alleged to) feel.  That Bob and   
Ted have both succeeded in placing their pieces is indeed encouraging.

We spoke with Cole Heinowitz yesterday.  She reports that plans are

held in Escondido) on the issue of federal arts funding.  More specifics    
should be available after the next planning meeting, scheduled for a week

we've tracked down some potential allies through our contacts as well.

Douglas Davis's "Multicultural Wars" is a good source for some background   
on the recent history of the Endowments.  The piece is especially good at   
pinpointing the flaws in the "conciliatory strategy" adopted by many arts   
advocates in the past half-decade or so.  Along with the *Voice* cover  
article of a week ago, this is great material to hand to someone who needs  
a rapid course in the shape this battle is taking.      
    
One snippet: "The paradox buried beneath the continuing muteness of the     
mainstream liberal-left is that even today's politically fraught    
contemporary art could be easily defended.  Long ago, proponents of today's 
avant-gardists should have argued that this democracy, or any democracy     
worth its name, thrives on dissent" (37).

QUEENSLAND STUDIES CENTRE ANNUAL CONFERENCE - 8-9 JULY      
    
    
    
_WAR'S  END?_   
    
    
August 1945 marked the end of the most harrowing and transforming   
collective experience in the history of modern Australia.  How much of the  
'old' Australia came to an end with the cessation of hostilities, and how   
much continued as before? What different meanings did the War's end have    
for different groups and institutions in Australian society?    
    
The Queensland Studies Centre will be holding its annual two-day    
conference, in association with the History Department of James Cook    
University, in Townsville, on 8-9 July of this year. Papers are invited     
which examine the myths and realities of the War's end - especially, though 
not exclusively, from the perspective of Queensland.        
    
The conference will be interdisciplinary in scope,  embracing military,     
social and cultural history; politics and political economy; literary and   
cultural studies. Papers exploring any of the following aspects of the  
topic would be welcome:     
    
* literature and the arts       
* education and social policy       
* Aboriginal and ethnic communities     
* women's history       
* military and social history       
* politics and industrial relations     
* journalism and the media      
    
Venue:  Townsville, Queensland.     
    
Date:   8-9 July, 1995.

Art may be equipped to deal with "a man's total perception of relations,"   
though probably not a woman's. Seriously, if you broaden the definition     
of theory to encompass this most hopeful, grandiose definition of art,  
then you've erased the difference between the two. Art may be able to do    
what theory or philosophy or other disciplines have failed to do. That is   
what Pound's statement means to me (and I don't care if that's not what     
he meant).

Because that tips the balance in the direction of domination. When      
explainers make such claims for their explanations, art is the loser.   
This doesn't have to be so, but this is what has happened over the past     
50 years or so. The framing of art has gotten increasingly more attention   
than the art itself. It's gotten so people can't tell the difference any    
more. They can't just bring themselves to a work of art, they're so     
fascinated or intimidated by all the discourse that they've forgotten   
what it's like to just let the work speak to them--that is, if they ever    
knew.

Interesting point, though we all live here today, not in ancient Greece.    
The opposition or at least difference between theory and practice is real   
today, even if their relation was different then. Still, I do like yr   
addition of a new term to this discussion. I'm all for talking about the    
social conduct of writers, whether opposed to theory or not. (At the very   
least, it's a good source for humor, as is demonstrated by recent   
"news articles" sent to this forum.)

Folks,  
    
Here's a letter to send to Senator Pressler of South Dakota, chair      
of the Senate Commerce Committee that oversees funding to the CPB.      
The language is stilted as per convention--I want his staff to read     
it.  The reasoning is from the 104th Congress, cut spending--it     
shows their contradiction in their own terms.   
    
Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending American public broadcasting      
because I think it's brilliant.  We have a long way to go before we     
gain the depth and diversity of the CBC, BBC, Rai Tre, etc.  But    
it's the best we've got, and if the 104th has its way there will    
soon be nothing left to improve.    
    
Download the letter.  Chop it.  Change it.  But please send it!

Washington, D.C.  20510     
    
Senator Pressler:       
    
As a hard-working citizen, I am concerned about how my tax dollars      
are spent.  I am even more concerned about returns on my tax    
investment in the Federal Government.   
    
I have recently read a report from the Reuter's about a letter you      
sent to the heads of the CPB, NPR, and PBS asking for financial     
information and predicting the inevitable commercialization of      
public broadcasting.  You and your colleagues in the 104th Congress     
have been spending a disconcertingly large amount of time and       
resources in an attempt to convince Americans of the need to cut    
this infinitesimally small budget line (much less than one one-     
hundredth of one percent of the national budget) while ignoring     
potentially significant cuts in budget items that are no longer     
relevant or return nothing to citizens and communities.  It appears     
that you are imprudently waging a costly ideological war at     
taxpayers' expense, and that cultural purification is more      
important to you and the new Congress than real reductions in       
spending.   
    
I have enclosed a list of questions enquiring into how you are      
spending my tax money.  I would like you to answer them as soon as      
possible.  I will distribute your responses to major South Dakota   
newspapers, internet groups serving South Dakota, and national      
media agencies.  If I receive no response from you by 25 Feb. 1995      
I will report your lack of willingness to answer a citizen's    
request to these media sources.     
    
Thank you for your prompt response.     
    
    
   Sincerely,       
    
    
    
    
        QUESTIONS   
    
    
(Please document all responses adequately, i.e. contracts, minutes      
of meetings, memos, research reports, etc.) 
    
1.   How much of your time have you spent trying to persuade the    
 American people that real budget relief could be accomplished      
 if the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was cut?        
    
 a.   What is the approximate cost to the American people of    
  this expenditure of your time?    
    
 b.   Have you ever instructed your staff, also paid with tax   
  dollars, to work in advocating cuts to public     
  broadcasting and at what cost to the taxpayer?        
    
  1.)  Are you aware that the salaries of yourself and      
   your staff are paid for %100 with tax-payer dollars      
   while only %14 of public broadcasters' salaries are      
   paid with tax money?     
    
  2.)  Are you working %86 harder to find programs to cut   
   within your own office and Congress?  If not, why    
   not?         
    
 c.   Are you aware that funding to the CPB is  only a tiny     
  fraction of one percent of our national budget and    
  cutting it in its entirety would do virtually nothing to      
  alleviate budget pressure?  If so, why are you spending   
  so much time and energy trying to convince Americans it   
  should be cut for the budget's sake?  
    
 d.   Are you intentionally misleading the American people      
  about the virtually nil reduction in the budget cutting   
  the CPB would cause?      
    
2.   Please supply an itemized list of all contributions of more    
 than $250 your staff has made to all political organizations   
 since your election.       
    
3.   Please supply a list of the name, religion, income and     
 membership in any political extremist group (i.e. the NRA,     
 Right to Life, Moral Majority, etc.) of everyone on your       
 staff. 
    
4.   Do you believe tax money should be used to defend the First    
 Amendment to the Constitution?     
    
 a.   Since public broadcasting is currently unlike commercial      
  broadcasting in that is not merely billboard space for    
  advertisers, how would commercial broadcasting,       
  influenced and limited in form and content every ten to   
  fifteen minutes by advertising, replace the unfettered    
  information found on public broadcasting?         
    
 b.   Does "balance" and "objectivity" in journalism mean that      
  equal time should be given to sides of issues proven      
  empirically or factually false?   
    
  1.)  Do you agree with Newt Gingrich's former appointee   
   to the position of House Historian that courses on   
   the Holocaust should include space for a     
   legitimation of the Nazi rationale?      
    
  2.)  Would your definition of "balance" include giving    
   equal time to Holocaust revisionists in a        
   discussion of World War II, Ku Klux Klan members in      
   a discussion of the Civil Rights struggle, or    
   cigarette manufactures in a discussion of cancer?    
    
 c.   Do you believe that whatever political party happens to   
  be in power should be given oversight of any public       
  medium?       
    
 d.   Do you believe that completely commercial media can be    
  "balanced" and "objective" even though they have to       
  protect the sources of their revenue, for-profit      
  corporations?     
    
 e.   Do you believe that completely commercial media can       
  report in a "balanced" fashion on things that might       
  threaten their complete dominance, such as the unique     
  value of public broadcasting, communication workers'      
  labor talks, or the possible psychological damage or      
  damage to families caused by persistent advertising?      
    
5.   Why was your meeting with Rupert Murdoch not opened to     
 reporters?         
    
 a.   How much have Rupert Murdoch, his associates, and his     
  employees donated to your political campaigns?        
    
 b.   Has Rupert Murdoch given any financial support or other   
  resources to the campaign to convince Americans that      
  budget problems would experience some relief if funding   
  to the CPB was cut?       
    
 c.   Has Rupert Murdoch promised you further generosity should     
  you manage to kill funding to the CPB?        
    
 d.   Were any of your staff at the meeting with Rupert     
  Murdoch?  If so, how much tax-payer money went to paying      
  them while they were at the meeting?  
    
 e.   Do you plan to meet with any other media moguls in the    
  near future to discuss the selling off of public      
  broadcasting bandwidths?      
    
6.   How much time in legal council was spent writing the 170-      
 question CPB demand for information and at what cost to the    
 taxpayer?  
    
  a.   How much time do you estimate CPB employees will     
   now have to spend answering this request and at      
   what cost to the taxpayer?   
    
  b.   Do you feel this money was well spent?

Dear Tom, I don't doubt that you have much knowledge about spirit. We   
could discuss the three kinds of spirit in the Jewish intellectual      
tradition, only it would be a pretty one-sided discussion, since I don't    
know that much about yr tradition. Not that I'm not interested--but a more  
pertinent question might be: Why aren't Lew Daly and his fellow editors     
interested?

Tom,    
This isn't the Pessoa poem you referenced, but another that seems   
not inappropriate:      
    
    
IF THEY WANT ME TO BE A MYSTIC,     
FINE.  SO I'M A MYSTIC.     
    
    
If they want me to be a mystic, fine. So I'm a mystic.      
I'm a mystic, but only of the body.     
My soul is simple; it doesn't think.    
    
My mysticism consists in not desiring to know,  
In living without thinking about it.    
    
I don't know what Nature is; I sing it.     
I live on a hilltop         
In a solitary cabin.        
And that's what it's all about.

A fine questionnaire and very much to the point, but I wonder whether   
letters to the leaders of the opposition pay off as much as letters to  
our own representatives who may be vacillating about their constituents     
commitment to responsible government. Not that I know the answer to this    
question.

James,  
    
I too am at a loss.  An exasperation compounded by feeling      
like I/we have no genuine representation in Washington or       
in Albany.  Even the Democrats are saying, "Sure I love All     
Things Considered, sure public broadcasting is great, but       
these are tough times, and that means we have to cut the        
inessentials."  Our Dems in New York, following the example     
of *their* Grand Poo-Bah of acquiescence Bill Clinton, have     
made it impossible to articulate any possible alternative by    
choosing to parrot all the erroneous assumptions of Newt and    
his ilk:  you are taxed too much, government is too big,        
public broadcasting is elitist/"liberal", the poor--not     
decades of lunatic defense spending--are responsible for a      
crushing debt, etc.  By failing to be critical of, and      
actually participating in this relentless stream of         
propaganda, they have made themselves part of the problem;      
but they may yet keep their jobs.   
    
I'm frustrated James.  I really don't know what to do.  You     
are certainly right, Democrats do need to know that we value    
public arts and public broadcasting; I've sent them a       
different letter.       
    
Feed me more ideas!

Total perception of relations implies to me, well, everything that      
informs the art. Certainly I'm not arguing, and I don't believe any-    
body is, that theory is somehow privileged over art, just that if it    
works, use it. If it doesn't, don't. But it does have some relevance    
to the creation of art? Are we  genuinely saying that a poet's      
aesthetics, politics, economics, etc., don't inform the poem? Not   
that it should be mistaken for the poem, okay, but does it come from    
nowhere? That's all I'm asking, really, when I talk about the relations     
thing.  
 I am interested, though, in the desire to keep poetry pure, clean  
of theory....   
 Listen, this is not an academic problem. This is a problem I face  
everyday when as I sit at my desk and my ideals about what poetry   
should be increasingly diverge with what I'm writing and I struggle     
to come to some resolution that never happens because it can't and      
that's what, to me, is interesting about writing. That I never write    
what I set out to write and am constantly surprised.        
 So this question is very important to me and why I've been following   
the discussion with great interest at what I see as very important POVs     
are articulated. Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

     BOULDER, COLO. (AHP) -- A rumor long circulated through    
 the city was finally confirmed today as Poetics Police disclosed   
 their raid on a local religious school's ``Sapphic hierarchy.''    
     The p-cops moved quickly, seizing documents and arresting      
 ringleaders. More specific details were not available at press     
 time.  
     Chief among the questions was just what a ``Sapphic    
 hierarchy'' might be.      
     Following the announcement, Boulder's Naropa Institute,    
 the nation's first accredited Buddhist college, announced a    
 severing of all ties with the famed Jack Kerouac School of

     Naropa's Board of Trustees insisted the decision had been      
 made before the raid.      
     The school's poetics program had long drawn criticism, but     
 Naropa ignored the warnings, in part because of the stature of the     
 Kerouac school, and partly because the poetry helped fund other    
 programs.  
     Named for famed alcoholic writer Jack Kerouac, the poetics     
 program has long attracted a wide variety of writers committed to the  
 school's permissive philosophy and multicultural agenda. Kerouac   
 is principally remembered for inspiring the TV series Route 66.    
     A Buddhist official speaking on condition of anonymity noted,  
 ``Other colleges have football and basketball, we have poets ... and   
 you know what trouble poets are.''     
     Anne Waldman, co-founder of the program, is suspected      
 of organizing the Sapphists. Led away for questioning with colleague   
 Andrew Schelling, she reportedly shouted, ``Yes! We're sure that   
 some of our students have sex, sometimes with each other, it's good    
 for them!''    
     Poet Jack Collom, called for a comment, said only, ``I don't

 know a thing. I was out with the boys shootin' pool and on my way      
 home.''    
     Waldman's intern, Katie Yates, had just returned from a    
 month-long meditation retreat. ``Great, just great,'' she told     
 reporters, ``I go away for a few weeks and the whole thing falls   
 apart ... maybe I'll go back to Albany.''  
     Followers of Naropa's history will recall earlier scandals.    
 In the late 1970s, students were required to pose nude for photographs     
 supposedly used in a study of meditation posture.      
     Neighborhood residents are determined to see an end put to     
 this controversial institution. Says Naropa neighbor Ni Kegap, ``I     
 don't mind the all night partyin' ... it's those endless `oms' ... it  
 just gets ugly after awhile ... they call it poetry but it doesn't     
 rhyme and it doesn't make sense.''     
     A shaken Peter Lamborn Wilson appeared on the front steps of   
 the school to quiet an angry crowd. ``Why can't we all just get along?''   
 wailed the normally mild-mannered Sufist.  
     A tense moment occurred when players from the University of    
 Colorado football team, which practices nearby, began heckling.

I have also added a couple of "press lists" to the Electronic Poetry    
Center (Roof included) which give lengthy lists of book titles. (The    
list for Sun & Moon is quite extensive.) They can be searched (in our   
system) with a /. But in any case, provide very interesting "charts"    
of what some presses have done.

Subject:  Cockney Rhyming of the m . . .    
    
Hi Ron and Chris.       
    
Briefly, Kacky pataki is Hackney rhyming slang for Karnaki - a form of fast 
interlocking group guttural vocal music produced in the Belo-sur-Tsiribina  
(meaning Place Where One Must Not Dive) area of west coastal Madagascar. It 
sounds like Ketjak when described like that I know. I went there last year  
and recorded some. Does that mean that we have something in common?     
    
I beg to differ though.     
    
In actual fact Lowkey Bloakey (well I knew you wouldn't believe me so I had 
to seed you into reading this far before I told the truth) is Cockney   
rhyming slang for Okey-Dokey  -  a form of self-defense through     
amelioration practiced, mainly by men, and only in London's East End. These 
days of course the 'happy chappy'is mostly used as a sweetener for      
community theatre workshops. It's apparently so named after the classic     
fence-sitting posture advocated by Mathew Arnold in 1849 when writing to    
fellow poet Clough of the need:     
    
'to begin with an idea of the world in order not to be prevailed over by    
the world's multitudinousness'      
    
a mantis which afflicts English poetry and its translations nay even unto   
this very day.  
Coherence is its essence.       
I haven't seen the apex yet that didn't harbour such.       
    
You're probably both right.     
cris

Subject:  The Housings of Parliament (a present time outs with its past)    
    
Hi. I've called for a decisive break with the past too. I tried to post it  
once before and only managed to preface an ammendment. And now I'm here as  
it were simply hoping to be present enough when one of these breaks with    
the past does call by as to attempt to either engage or represent its   
interests.  
This is a call for FAT TIME. Engagement with or without of the blah blah.   
ALERT BREATH.   
    
'The Curse Of The Vernacular'   or   'The Minutiae Of Preference',      
'The Return of The Plague of The Dreams of The Undecided'.      
    
Ira raises issues of improvisation, of music, of body and voice  -  amongst 
(or between) others. Improvisation is the salt (Fame Is Not The Spur) of    
process to the materials of composition.    
Improvisation is not 'free' and they who suggest that it can be are spent.  
But I wouldn't suggest that the dues are what have to be paid for. Down     
traits of avoidance have developed which are certain  -  as to flurry with  
an -all-too-frequency mode of anxiety. Who Goes There Perimeters are the    
familiar policed.       
    
Recognisable slack has evolved through imitation of previously incisive     
strategies. Impro and Lang-po share the worst burden of flattery - as   
urgency worn second-hand. Many will have their own catelogues of denial in  
these respects.         
    
When Robert Grenier wrote "I HATE SPEECH" (his shout not mine) did he   
understand the irony that language writers would 'find' their voices by     
such turns? 
Impacting tectonics of playful curiosity, rigorous enquiry and specific     
discovery onto the dominant familial nodes of poetic formulation and    
circulation. Again paralleels (sic) with Impro. Now some 20 years on.   
Hardly surprising and highly desirable that impetus for re-alignment has    
come.   
    
Or  - (gods) how do I love the mud on the boots far more than her boots     
itselfish?  
Those who know her work well will witness her circumnavigations of binary   
oppositions. G1 or G3. These roads are already furrows. Brows knit toward   
mind set. Please   r e l e a s e e m.   
And    then    become political.    
    
Chance overcharacterised into exquisitely interfastening rather than    
threatening difference  -  sorry, deference.    
    
And then becomes political      
    
With the Upper and the Lower Houses intent on holding their poses   
sufficiently long as to be impressed on the minds of they who are cast as   
spectators -  and a bright-eyed horde quietly transporting the gates to

Subject:  Espousing 2/8     
    
Before proceeding with this update (dealing mostly with legislative matters 
and the questions Martin Spinelli and James Sherry raised today about where 
to direct one's energies), I want to pose an open question to members of    
this list: would you (pl.) prefer that such postings migrate off-list or is 
it useful to have them appear here?     
    
The Poetics-list was an invaluable resource in the first rush of organizing 
*FE*, but as we settle into the weeks and months of ongoing activity, we    
are wary of trying the patience of those who don't much care about this     
particular struggle (perhaps especially those who log-in from non-U.S.  
sites).  We could easily enough shift to cc-trees if continued use of this  
space doesn't seem appropriate.     
    
Jen and I will make a decision about this in the next week or two, based on 
whether any consensus emerges one way or the other on the list (though that 
would be a rare occasion).  So let's hear it.

*Who to Write: Dem or Them?*    
    
James Sherry wondered this morning (with reference to Martin Spinelli's     
wonderful retort to Pressler) "whether letters to the leaders of the    
opposition pay off as much as letters to our own representatives who may be 
vacillating about their constituents commitment to responsible government.  
Not that I know the answer to this question."   
    
I don't know the answer either, but I have been repeatedly told that even   
with consolidated support from Democrats, the NEA is extremely vulnerable.  
As Patrick A. Trueman (how do they all end up with names like that?) of the 
conservative Christian "American Family Association" told a reporter: "Of   
the 73 new Republican freshmen...probably 65 of them oppose NEA funding     
altogether" ("Opposing Interests Brace for a Culture Clash," by Jon Healey, 
_Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report_, 28 Jan 1995).      
    
The reporter goes on to cite two amendments proposed in 1994, one to    
eliminate NEA funding (105 votes short of passage) and one to slash its     
budget by 54% (86 votes short).  Even allowing for the fact that Trueman is 
bragging,the post-Coup margin has become distressingly slim.    
    
The question is, as I think Ron pointed out vis-a-vis "Duke" in     
Escondido--how to make it *cost* these folks something if they oppose the   
NEA? Right now they just see *profits* (both symbolic and material) galore. 
There's little leverage given the current composition of the Congress, but  
the low voter turnout which is the dirty secret behind the so-called GOP    
"Mandate" makes 1996 a specter perhaps worth invoking.  It's just a     
thought, and one predicated on the assumption (totally unproven) that the   
Backlash will itself produce the conditions for its own electoral demise in 
the next 18 months.         
    
*Wesleyan begins to organize*       
    
We got a call today from an undergraduate (Sr.) at Wesleyan who is just     
beginning to organize an event for Febrary 16th.  Anyone with contacts in   
the writing scene on/around that campus is welcome to forward tips to him   
through us.  Right now it looks as though the format will be a tight    
two-hour program of talks.

Subject:  PRESSLER QUESTIONNAIRE    
    
    As they say on the FAN, I'm a first-time caller. Actually, I've only    
been on this list (& the internet) for a few weeks, and hadn't yet put in my    
two dimes' worth, both because of work deadlines and because I hadn't yet   
figured out how.  Thought I'd take the time & energy to figure this listserv    
mechanism out now, out of a feeling that activists who are doing great work 
can always use a few words of thanks & support when they express feelings of    
exasperation.   
    In response to Martin Spinelli, who wrote, "I too am at a loss.  An 
exasperation compounded by feeling like I/we have no genuine representation 
in Washington or        
in Albany,"  I'd like to offer support & thanks for coming up with such an  
imaginative & inspiring tactic--the questionnaire to Pressler.  (Actually,  
I've been totally impressed with all the great organizing work being done by    
dozens of you on this list around the NEA and CPB issues.)      
    Re Martin's questions, it's a tough political & strategic question to   
figure out how best challenge both Republicans' Contract on America and     
Democrats' continuing shift to the right. In the long term, I think, it's   
going to take new progressive movement-building, both to pressure the   
potentially progressive Democrats into shifting toward the truly-democratic 
left and also to develop new alternative vehicles that are capable of winning   
more than once in a while. And I think we need *multi-issue* vehicles, since    
it *can* get pretty frustrating trying to fight these battles one   
issue/crisis at a time. (One of my main political projects these days is a  
New Jersey welfare rights group, called Solutions to End Poverty--welfare   
another topic on which both alleged-Republicans and so-called Democrats--esp.   
under Clinton--are pretty horrible.) Actually, I really think we need to help   
build a new third party, but that's a topic best left for another sleepless 
early morning. Meanwhile, we're left with this one-issue-at-a-time      
crisis-mode organizing, in which we can only do the best we can, as we  
simultaneously try to defeat the Republicans and try as much as possible to 
remove the new elephant snouts on the members of the donkey party. And Martin   
and others:  please know that there are those of us out here listening and  
inspired--and, incidentally, sending out postcards--by your hard & creative 
work.   
    By the way, have you contacted press (both major media & alternative    
media like Pacifica) with copies of your questionnaire to Pressler? I didn't    
see mention of that in your original note. Maybe having a poetry group  
calling a press conference with that questionnaire as a centerpiece?  It's so   
imaginative I think media might pick it up & add to the pressure on Pressler    
(who, by the way, I've heard has already withdrawn some of his most intrusive   
questions to the CPB). Also, maybe send copies of questionnaire to other    
activist groups working on additional aspects of the Contract on America, to    
start building long-term alliances?     
    In closing, quite an interesting basketball game down here in Central   
Jersey tonight, between Rutgers & University of Massachusetts, whose unusual    
half-time showstopper demonstration helps maintain my hope in young people's    
political determination and willingness to act. Thanks again. Sincerely,    
Eliot Katz

Seeing the issues raised on the server has a specific use to me in that I   
wonder what "poetic" issues are more primary. Granted this is an issue of   
organizing, but organizing is also the work of getting the right words

My vote too is for you to continue posting the news.  Though I am one   
of the mostly silent ones on the net (principally due to the demands    
of my administrative office job), I often do end up forwarding      
pertinent info to various friends & activists.  The questionairre to    
Pressler is, for example, a gem.  We will have a NPR rep on campus      
later in the week, & she may be interested in some of what's going      
on.  I also am in touch with one of our senator's legislative aides,    
and info provided through this discussion group has been very       
helpful.

Every "poem" (every "fact" in fact) is imbued with and attached to a    
theoretical structure which both informs it and from which it does not  
separate except in the minds of those who would create a transparent    
simulacrum of reality where the pure is real. Fortunately these isolated    
realities are fiction although some use the possibility ot inform their     
misguided politics. We have poetries which are embossed with their      
cultures and some readers and even some writers pretend not to see that.    
Thoughts are not purer than bodies and poems are the products of both and   
as such do not exist in isolation, nor can they be distilled into a     
spirit, although some use the possibility to inform their misguided     
poetics. James

To clarify the off-list alternative mentioned in Espousing Update 2/8: what 
we would do is build a group of names/e-addresses to be reached through the 
"cc" (copy to) function on our Eudora software.  Awkwardly large "headers"  
are the downside of this option.

     WASHINGTON (AHP) -- Leaders of the Association of Poets    
 in Retirement aren't quite sure what Apex Speaker Lew Daly has     
 in mind with his call for rethinking Poeticare ``from the ground   
 up.'' But what they've heard worries them. 
     ``The speaker's proposal left me fully depressed,'' said   
 Rae Armantrout of San Diego, Calif., a member of the APR's council     
 of outspoken elders. ``He wants to scuttle Poeticare with some weasel  
 words -- `radical transparency'.''     
     Other APR officials are more circumspect, but they, too,   
 express anxiety.       
     Anselm Hollo of Boulder, Colo., a retired punster and part-time    
 versifier, said, ``Anytime you destroy something and you build from    
 the ground up ... you're in trouble because you may lose some of the

 good parts.''  
     ``I'm not saying Poeticare shouldn't be looked at and      
 modifications shouldn't be made,'' added Hollo, chairman of    
 Numerous Adequate Poets (NAP), which helps shape policy for the    
 G1-endorsed APR.       
     Poeticare is the shoe that hasn't dropped in the newly     
 empowered ``Spirit'' majority's agenda for sweeping change.    
     With Small Press Publishing still accorded sacred cow      
 status by both parties, the costly Poeticare program is among the      
 biggest and most tempting targets for title-trimmers and word-cutters.     
     Daly called yesterday for a top-to-bottom review of Poeticare  
 and its ``highly centralized bureaucratic structure offering one   
 menu for everybody in a monopolistic manner.'' He appealed to G1   
 writers to help poeticians think through ``how we get to a better      
 Poeticare system that actually works more extensively, that gives      
 greater choices, and that is also socially more honest.''      
     He said later that the older poets should be able to join      
 Happening Movements and Organizations (HMOs) to extend their       
 careers, and use archive sales or choose other methods for

 attracting attention to their work.    
     While 10 percent of the G1 poets are enrolled voluntarily      
 in HMOs, Poeticare remains a bastion of fee-for-service poetry.    
 Individual arts organizations set fees for readings and regulate   
 schedules, but the poets can utilize any series they wish, so long     
 as the organization is willing to accept them. 
     Jean Day, a retired G1 poet who spent her career as top    
 manager of Small Press Distribution, likes the old system. ``I want    
 fee for service (poetry). I want to be able to set my own agenda.''    
     But most younger poets now are in some form of managed care.   
 If they want unrestricted access to readings and publishing, they      
 have to pay more for it. State-funded Poetics Programs are rushing to  
 push Poeticaid recipients -- the poor and the socially needy -- into   
 managed care.  
     A year ago, the APR looked to special issues of literary   
 journals as a path for literary reform. That never materialized.   
     Now it is girding for a fight just to protect what they have,  
 despite President Bernstein's plea in last week's State of the Art     
 address not to tap Poeticare to pay for G2's ``Contract with America.''

     ``There are things in the Poeticare system that clearly need   
 work,'' said Jerry Rothenberg, the APR's executive director. ``I   
 don't think Poeticare is going to remain the way it is forever, or     
 that HMOs are going to sweep the nation.'' 
     Sen. Juliana Spahr, Spir.-N.Y, reminded ``Lang-Po'' leaders    
 that the Poeticare trust fund will go broke in seven years. ``We   
 can't say something is off the board and is untouchable,'' said the    
 Poetics Program's Labor and Human Resources Committee chair.       
     She suggested that options for dealing with Poeticare's    
 woes include basing Poeticare benefits on financial need and moving    
 more of the G1 writers toward managed care.    
     Daly and the chairpersons of the Apex Ways and Means and   
 Commerce committees all support the idea of letting people spend   
 their words crit-free to help accumulate intellectual capital.     
     Bill Howe, policy director of the Center for the Study of      
 Accelerated Aesthetics in Austin, said poetry IRAs have the potential  
 to ``lead to a radical restructuring of the poetry world'' as

can be done.

RE: CPB Funding - On Line Tool Available Now    
    
A new tool is available now to help us communicate with listeners about     
the funding situation in Washington.    
    You have no doubt heard about the discussions in Washington to  
    eliminate funding for public broadcasting.  Action is needed now.   
    To voice your support for continued funding of public radio, send an    
    e-mail to pub hyphen broad at american dot edu.  Information will be    
    e-mailed back to you on how to make your voice heard in Washington. 
    That's pub hyphen broad at american dot edu.("pub-broad@american.edu")  
    Now more than ever, it's critical to make your support of public radio  
    known.  
    Thank you.      
    
Public Radio International (PRI) and "Soundprint" have collaborated to  
create an automatic e-mail system that will provide listeners the   
information needed to create letters to congress.       
    
This Internet project builds on the capacities of the Soundprint Media  
Center and is 100% privately funded.  Here is how it works.     
    
Listeners can send e-mail to the address    
"pub-broad@american.edu."       
A computer will field these messages and automatically send the listener    
back instructions on how to voice their support for public broadcasting in  
Washington.  Listeners will receive a thank you, instructions, a list of    
congressional and house addresses (regular and e-mail),     
phone numbers and sample talking points for a letter.       
    
The instructions will encourage letters first, calls second and e-mail  
last.   
The need for quick action and personal stories will be highlighted.     
Listeners are warned NOT to simply forward the e-mail they get to   
Washington. 
    
This service will be in place for 90 days - through April 30, 1995.  It may 
be extended at any time.

While the posts are of passing interest to me I end up deleting most them.  
While I don't mind continuing to receive them in this list I wonder whether 
it may not be more effective politically to create a list which includes    
cultural activists from all affected art forms....

If you use the "bcc" function you don't get large "headers" (or at least I

The specifics of your struggle differ, yet:-    
    
I was directly involved in events at The Poetry Society in London 1977  
through which petit bourgeouis bureaucrats and 'least line of resistance'   
cultural tsars hid under the skirts of an enquiry by a member of the House  
of Lords (Sir John Witt) designed in the words of Eric Mottram to finger    
the transatlantic influence of 'foreign poets' as 'a treacherous assault on 
British poetry'. This happened here under a Labour Government of MPs    
running ('three wheels on my wagon') scared towards re-election with the    
spectre of Thacherism blooming marge. The outcome effectively and   
resolutely closed the door on linguistically innovative poetries here,  
whether produced within Britain or abroad. The result  -  a lasting     
internal exile for several poets and a blinkered (or bycycle clipped)   
retrenchment into Little England for poetry (period) in these countries.    
The waters closed over so quickly as to enable Donald Hall to write in 1979 
that 'the poetries of England and America have become discontinuous'.   
    
We abandoned the site of conflict in disgust and distaste, we resigned and  
opted for forms resistance which have yet to impinge sufficiently   
exquisitely onto the rewritten agenda as to need to be addressed. A recent  
crop of ironic Mottram obituaries in the national press revisit such sites  
by calling him perhaps the best known of the "unknown poets" here. I can    
still remember, with a chill, Lee Harwood being surprised that the powers   
of reaction within the British establishment didn't behave 'like    
gentlemen'. As a pre-phrasing of the words of Martin Spinelli on this list  
(6/2/95) we sat by and shrugged and we got what we deserved.    
    
The parellels don't seem too slender. I hope you don't berate these     
observations from afar.     
    
The sites of the formations of pernicious National and Cultural Identities  
are still sign and syntax. Prevent the hardening of the arteries within and 
without of the body-politic by intensifying engagement at those sites.  
    
Pressler sure knows what he's doing. From this distance, through networks   
such as Freely Espousing, it seems that there is an ability to respond  
being nurtured - a movement encouraged.     
    
I for one value that activity AS the poetry.    
    
thanks, cris

Dear People 
    
this is, from a somewhat out-of-town Aucklander in New Zealand, to say that I'd 
 like very much for the List to continue to espouse the Espousing. Apart from it
overt interest, it is a salutary lesson for some of us here about how these part
airwaves (are they 'airwaves? or is it just one of them pesky cliches that do ta
so much of one's talk...) (er, no inferences being spread here abt others etc), 
placed at the service of such issues.  About State arts funding in general, 
it's always clear that any administrative body (including my own) will make 
decisions that others will find legitimately questionable. The important point i
whether the structure that initiates those acts of difference is worth retaining
spite of the fact that it is always going to be imperfect according to any set o
one might want to place alongside it. From here, it seems to me that the NEA    
discussion is absolutely appropriate, and already within those earlier posts in 
which questions were being (properly) asked about being a writer/being a citizen
and is there any connection between them. So, I don't really think that my  
geographical distance from the location of the discussion can get to define 
how the discussion actually impinges upon my 'location' in the world, any more  
really than being across the other side the world from Bosnia or Northern Irelan
does. Anything that can happen there can happen here. If it comes to one's  
notice, then it's there for one's noticing etc etc. Best wishes to all, Alan Lon

Dear James, 
    
I never said anything about "purity," nor did I say art does not reflect    
theory (along with all those other relations?) in some way. What I've   
been saying, or trying to say, is that art and theory are on different  
levels.     
    
In so far as it is a reply to me, your statement seems based upon   
exaggerating or misunderstanding what I have said, so that you can attack   
this transparent simulacrum strawman of yours. Again, I do not believe  
that art is pure. I'm not sure I believe that anything in our human world   
is pure. What I believe is that art and theory (or philosophy or politics   
or...) are not the same thing, that they are not on the same level. The     
figure of separate levels does not mean the levels are hermetically     
sealed from each other. I think it's interesting and maybe revealing    
that you (and in a different way, Eric) would assume or conclude this.  
    
Whatever that might mean, I don't have a need to get carried away with  
it. I'm inclined to think this is more than just an innocent    
misunderstanding between us, but I could be wrong.      
    
In the spirit of avoiding a contentious fight, I would like to add that     
I've been mulling over yr point about doxa ever since I read it and made    
my quick reply. The more I think about it the more I think it is quite  
relevant to our world here today. So I'm sorry if my response appeared to   
express more disagreement than appreciation for this thought.       
    
It may be that a significant opposition lurking beneath this discussion     
(and many others) is doxa. If so I wonder, how are we to distinguish this   
doxa from what it opposes?

How about classic compromise, leave postings on this list and copy to   
another which, taking up Mark's point (and it's a good one) forges a

Dear Eric,  
    
Those who have a big investment in theory may be prejudiced in      
a direction which will impair their judgment about what does and doesn't    
work when it comes to creating or appreciating art. As I told James, I'm    
not advocating purity. The fact that you both think I am might indicate     
that you both have trouble stepping back from the discourse, that it's  
hard for you to hear someone who is simply saying art must have its level.  
    
Of course art doesn't come from nowhere. And of course it is inevitable     
that there will be all kinds of influences upon this art. To me this means  
we can free up our process as much as we see fit. A successful process is   
one that allows these influences to happen as they may, or as they may  
not. The guiding principle is whatever transports the work in and of    
itself. This will not happen if external influences or conscious    
intentions are too strong. This to me is the same as saying that art must   
be on its own level. This does not mean it's sealed off from anything.

Excuse me if I sound "misguided" (misguided? isn't that something that  
happens to lapsed catholics and neo-post-trots?), but I'm having a      
hard time with this. My (misguided?) understanding of "theories" is     
that people make them up to explain things. Hence the etymologiocal     
derivation from that whole Greek specular trip: to see (what's      
"behind" the veil). Mr. Sherry's formulation seems to imply that people     
write poems based on theories, rather than writing theories based on    
poems. This may be the way "Language poets" do it, but it hardly seems  
a necessary relation. Perhaps there's a confusion here between      
"theory" and "cosmology".       
    
Best,

I would agree that Mr. Sherry seems to be arguing a chicken before the egg  
thing.  However, it's hard for me to really figure out which one comes first.   
 I tend to side with the egg (poetry) these days, but I know from experience    
that I was only able to write what I consider *decent* work after I learned 
something about social theory and the history of art.  I was basically a    
scientist until age 25, when I met Steve Evans and Jennifer Moxley.  They   
showed me society.  They showed me art.     
    
I would be interested to hear James talk out how he and others in the late  
70's-early 80's *decided* to write Lang-Po.  Did it come from Zukofsky,     
Barthes and Althusser?  Did it come from a hatred of that Deer poem by  
Richard Wilbur (?) where he thinks hard for us all?  Did it come consciously?   
 Did it come from the radio?  Did he just do it?        
    
The problem I feel now (at 35) though is that theory is getting in the way of   
creation.  I worry too much about correctness, politcal, avante-garde, et al,   
to really create something interesting that isn't just a rehash of something    
I just did or someone else just did.  Maybe it's just a case of the     
composition blues.  I remember my composition teachers telling me that there    
were two steps to writing a paper:  free writing / brainstorming and editing    
/ revising.  The two functions are supposedly controlled by different parts 
of the brain.   
    
I'm hinting at community formation as the bridge between theory and practice.   
 Anyone want to play poker on Sun night?

Spencer's recent postings on the "level" of art reminded me of Oppen's lines    
from "Of Being Numerous":       
    
One must not come to feel that he [sic] has a thousand threads in his hands,    
He must somehow see the one thing; This is the level of art There are other 
levels But there is no other level of art   
    
In a reading late in life (I think NY, 1979, but I'm not positive) he reads 
this last line as "But this is the level of art."       
    
As regards George Bowering's locating of the Pessoa-in-translation line as  
"What's it all about, Alfredo"--so we've traded the Hokey Pokey for "What's It  
All About, Alfie" now?

Little Bob, my favorite frog worterbuch tells me that the _other_   
meaning of the word "theorie",in  French,  via Greek "theo^ria"     
(procession) refers to a delegation of people sent by a city to a   
sacred occasion or to a great temple. By extension (1907) it came to    
mean "groups of people walking one behind the other." (Camus, for ex.,  
has "des theories de femmes"). On the other hand, walking in a single   
line will be given by my dictionaire allemand as "im Gansemarch," i.e.  
goose-stepping.

You're so right, Chris Cheek, but "folk" do 
Adapt freely so that Pokey is       
Widespread now, probably on account of  
A confusion with the ice-cream flavour.     
    
The big question for poetology may be   
What do you do when it comes to     
The verse:  
"You put your right arm in...."  & that     
    
Is where poetry and theory intersect.

  LONDON (AHP) - Some 10 or 15 rare birds died last night   
 in a Cambridge fire while their keeper was on a drinking binge     
 to celebrate being named Poet Laureate to the English Crown.       
  The fire, which broke out shortly after midnight in Gonville  
 and Caius, raged through a shelter for rare breeds of swans, guinea    
 fowl and peacocks for more than an hour before sleeping cricket    
 players at a nearby college called the porter. 
  ``The firemen said they came across the keeper staggering     
 around his room,'' remarked the porter. ``Earlier that same day    
 he had been heard shouting `I am Prin ... Prince Jay-Re-Me!' to no     
 one in particular.''       
  No birds survived the blaze.

Each poem has a theoretical basis whether it is acknowledged or not.    
Poetry and theory are separate but not separable and do not precede or  
follow each other. James

Alas, Bill I cannot show how anyone "decided" to write Lang-Po, since it    
was not decided and was not written. It has been perceived as having been   
written by those who wish to oversimplify the realities of what was     
written during that period down to this. Get a little subtle, please. Jmeas

Pierre, I'm pretty tired and just typed poverty instead of poetry.

"Hey, what's happening?"        
    
But we remember that Paul liked a lively English version of

Well, there is 'New Zealand Ice Cream Company' shop in my local shopping    
centre and they have Hokey Pokey flavour. However there is a US based   
icecream/frozen yought company (Rollins? I can remeber its name) in     
Paddington and they have a flavour called "the orginal Hokey Pokey ice  
cream".

Spencer, I hear you. I really do, but I must ask finally, what is your  
definition of theory? It seems as if James and I are using a definition     
that calls for contextualization, and frankly, I think youre idea of    
theory is these names which form the heading for the discussion that,   
and I agree with you wholeheartedly, has gone on far too long.      
 Art does have its level. I agree. But it also has a context,   
which I will call theoretical, and it is an act of violence that    
Shelley, Milton, Pound and even that most unintellectual of intellectual    
poets, O'Hara, would perhaps resent, to rip it from that context.   
 My thing about purity was simply that it didn't seem to me that    
what we were saying here, or more precisely what Tom and others     
were saying since I did indeed butt-in, was all that "radical"      
or even particularly "theoretical." It just seemed sensible to me   
and I wondered why it bothered you. That's all. 
 As for the academy: You scored a hit. I'm an academic, or a wanna  
be academic which shows you already the fool you're dealing with here,  
and I certainly have an interest in "complexifying matters." But, I'm   
a lot of other things too. None of which I can, or want, to seperate    
from my work, admittedly limited though it is.  
 I think a lot of important issues are coming up. I think the reason    
we are not any closer to resolving them (and by the way I give you      
a great deal of credit personally Spencer for having the stamina to take    
on all comers) is that they cannot be resolved. I think it is from these    
tensions that the best work comes.      
 Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

Thanks to everyone who voiced an opinion on whether these updates should    
continue landing on the poetics-list.  The current vote (including some     
back-channel communications) stands at 15-2 for continuing here.  We've     
also gotten some good advice about how else to use the Net (especially from 
Sandra Braman).  More as that develops.     
    
What follows is an especially long update (if you read nothing else, do at  
least check out "National Security Concerns," where a Jack Collum poem is   
credited with directly undermining the nation's armed services).    
    
We'll probably be off-line now until early next week as we travel to NYC    
for Jennifer's reading with Bill Luoma on Saturday at the Ear and Rae   
Armantrout/Lisa Jarnot/Lee Ann Brown's reading at Segue on Sunday.  So:     
Good luck to Bob, Susan, and Gil in Philadelphia on Saturday!

*National Security Concerns*    
    
The 7 February Congressional Record notes the following exchange between    
Georgia Republican Jack Kingston and Duncan Hunter (R-California):      
    
"Mr. Kingston: It is interesting, everybody does like to jump on the    
Pentagon, wasteful spending and talk about the $400 toilet seat and $200    
hammer and so forth.  We want to know about these things.  We want to   
ferret it out.  We think that is what the mission is about, defense of the  
country, survival of the country, and protecting your son or your daugher   
who may need to have the most high-technology airplane or tank or ship or   
whatever.   
    
Here is something that we, as taxpayers, your taxpayers in Californian and  
mine in Georgia, $30,000 on this poem.  I am going to read this to you.     
    
'Suddenly, masked hombres seized Petunia pig and made her into a sort of    
dense Jello.  Somehow the texture, out of nowhere, produces a species of    
Atavistic anomie, a melancholy memory of good food.'        
    
It was written by Jack Collom of Boulder, Co.  The National Endowment for   
the Arts awared $30,000 for that poem.  
    
And yet we are telling our American service personnel that they cannot get  
a raise.  We are rolling the COLA's of veterans so that they cannot get     
what we contractually obligated to them.    
    
I have met in Hinesville, GA, service personnel who can qualify for food    
stamps and other public assistance benefits.  Some of them are taking them, 
some are not.  But it is very hard to tell somebody who is on his way to    
Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, wherever, we have got $30,000 for poems like this   
and your tax dollars are paying for it.  I think one of the things that we  
are about in the Congress right now is to go back and try to find things    
like this so we can spend our dollars smarter, cut where we need to.  But   
where we are going to spend, let us spend appropriately.        
    
Mr. Hunter:  I think the description of the expenditures that were made by  
the National Endowment for the Arts are one thing that would lower the  
morale of our service people if they knew that that was keeping them from   
having a higher quality of life."   
    
(Congressional Record, 7 Feb 95:  H1360.  The CR for 7 Feb also records     
some remarks, made in the context of the Balanced Budget Amendment debate,  
by Arkansas Democratic Senator Dale Bumpers that are strongly CPB/NEA/NEH.  
Cf. S2243.) 
    
    
*HR 579*    
    
Another sponsor has added their name to Hefley's bill (The 'Privatization   
of Humanities Act,'): California Republican Dana Rohrabacher (2-8-95).  
    
*House Subcommittee Timeline*       
    
When I spoke to the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families     
yesterday, I was told that nothing pertaining to the NEA/NEH will be    
considered within the next two weeks.  You can call 1-202-226-2026 for  
recorded information about the SubCom's schedule (release one week at a     
time I believe).        
    
*Back on 1/25*  
    
Speaking with CD Wright (who was instrumental in organizing FE-Providence)  
over the past two days, I realize that we never mentioned an event that     
took place in Wilmington NC on 25 January.  Through the help of Deborah     
Luster (a photographer) and Michael Luster (a folklorist), an       
already-scheduled reading by Mark Strand was linked to *FE* and to the  
defense of federal arts funding more generally.  CD reports that 800 people 
attended that reading.  Strand apparently addressed the crisis and tons of  
LitNet postcard-kits and other valuable information was distributed.    
    
    
*Wesleyan Contact*      
    
I omitted AJ Weissbard's name from yesterday's update about plans for a Feb 
16th event at Wesleyan.  Speakers will likely include RISD President (and   
*FE* 1/28 alum) Roger Mandle and George White of the Eugene O'Neill

Dear Alan,  
Thank you for your post on Oppen. I hadn't connected my     
statements to him (or anyone else) consciously. But it's nice to know, or   
be reminded, that someone of his importance had a view of art which is  
similar to mine. It seems to me that my position is somewhat basic. Not     
that I think everyone will or could agree with me. Since I have made most   
of my statements in dissent, I could hardly think that. But I do believe    
that I am not the only one who has been bothered by the dominance of some   
who hold differing views.

I agree that every poem (and work of art) may be viewed as a theory.    
Considering my recent statements, it may come as no surprise that I trust   
this form of theory the most.

This sounds a bit like There is a God whether He is acknowledged or     
not. Amen. (Yikes! Shades of the M'ers creeping into the L-space.) It   
does make it kind of hard to have a conversation, though, when one      
side knows the truth. Or is all that just a theory you made up?

Ron,    
    Honig is not very good, it's true. A later edition of       
his Pessoa selected involves another translation (whose name,       
I don't recall), and she's not much of an improvement. Tehre's      
a small volume by James Greene and Clara de Azevado Mafra, but      
it suffers from Greene's usual lugubrious _sensitivity_. Jonathon   
Griffin has done some Pessoa quite well, yet, published in      
England, these are not always easily available, tho I think     
SPD carries something.      
    A young poet and translator, Richard Zenith, an American    
living in Lisbon, has done some much better Pessoa; in particular   
_The Book of Disquiet_ - the long prose _meditation_ by P.'s    
semi-heteronym whose moniker I can't recall (i.e. not Reis,     
Caiero or de Campos). Again, not widely available.

Re: James Sherry's:         
    
"Every "poem" (every "fact" in fact) is imbued with and attached to a   
theoretical structure which both informs it and from which it does not  
separate except in the minds of those who would create a transparent    
simulacrum of reality where the pure is real. Fortunately these isolated    
realities are fiction although some use the possibility ot inform their     
misguided politics. We have poetries which are embossed with their      
cultures and some readers and even some writers pretend not to see that.    
Thoughts are not purer than bodies and poems are the products of both and   
as such do not exist in isolation, nor can they be distilled into a     
spirit, although some use the possibility to inform their misguided     
poetics."   
    
True words, and I'd like to hear more. What James calls a "theoretical  
structure," does he (do you) mean at once a cultural structure (simply,     
you cannot separate e.g. Pessoa from the dying Portugese ex-colonial    
culture), inasmuch as (obviously) everyone inhabits a culture and com-  
plexly writes within it, and (also at once) an ideological structure?   
Do all poets write, on the other hand, from within an ideology? Or      
maybe that's better put, are all cultures ideological?      
    
Also, the following phrases in James contribution above; "a theoretical     
structure which both informs it and from which it does not separate,"   
now there's a further claim, and one which is interesting, radical, and     
with which I think I might disagree, tho I'm not sure we'd be meaning   
the same thing. In other words, is there no sense in which a work   
departs its origins? A person, does a person depart his/her origins?    
How does culture change, in other words? And, do poets have a function  
in that change? (e.g. Pessoa took that milieu and moved it somewhere,   
in his work, and, by intention and influence, in his readers)       
    
I'm interested in these questions.

"CONTRACT WITH AMERICA" VS. THE ARTS    
    
 U.S. House Speaker Gingrich and his allies have made clear in the first    
 days of the 104th Congress their intention to zero-out funding for     
 federally-supported cultural programs.  It is likely to prove a long and   
 protracted battle, with the greatest threat to the National Endowment for  
 the Arts (NEA),  the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the  
 Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) coming from attempts to pass the 
 "Contract with America."  In order to finance the tax cuts proposed in the 
 "Contract, " House Speaker Gingrich has recommended slashing funding for   
 the arts, humanities and public broadcasting.  
    
 According to a recent action alert circulated by People for the American   
 Way, cultural funding is not simply being targeted as part of an effort to 
 balance the budget, but it is part of a political payback to the Religious 
 Right for their support in last November's election.  People For asserts   
 that the call for defunding the cultural agencies is ideological, that     
 these agencies have for several years now been under attack for funding    
 works which the Religious Right finds objectionable and that this latest   
 assault is merely a new packaging of the same agenda, aimed at achieving   
 the same end -- the silencing of those voices the Far Right finds      
 objectionable.         
    
 The legislative battle will take place over a series of months during the  
 first half of 1995, with critical votes taking place in several different  
 committees, as well as on the floor of the House and Senate.  According to 
 People For the American Way, political pressure from the grassroots must   
 begin immediately, otherwise the arts may not make it to the second round  
 of this fight.  House Speaker Gingrich's pledge to consider the "Contract" 
 in the first hundred days is is being understood by arts advocates     
 nationwide to mean that a Budget Committee proposal will make its way to   
 the floor of the House of Representatives by late March or early April.    
 Sources suggest that efforts to eliminate cultural funding are likely to be    
 incremental, with a multi-year phasing out of federal support for NEA, NEH 
 and CPB.   
    
 Soon after Congress takes action on the "Contract," the House of   
 Representatives will begin its annual appropriations process.  As      
 the Appropriations Committee considers funding levels for the NEA, NEH     
 and CPB,   
 they are expected to be urged by Republican leadership to recommend funding    
 amounts which reflect the "Contract."  The House Appropriations Bill will  
 make its way to the House floor by mid-summer, with the Senate following   
 suit in late summer or early fall.  In addition to providing funding for   
 the three agencies, this year Congress must also reauthorize the NEA,  
NEH and     
 CPB.   Both House Appropriations Chair Livingston (R-LA) and Senate    
 Appropriations Chair Hatfield (R-OR) have indicated that unless the    
 agencies are reauthorized, they will be unwilling to recommend any future  
 funding.  Senators Kassebaum and Jeffords have indicated a strong interest 
 in moving quickly in the Senate on NEA reauthorization.  The first hearing 
 before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee took place on January    
 24th, with NEA chair Jane Alexander testifying.  Additional hearings and   
 mark-up are expected in mid-February and early March.  Senator Pressler,   
 who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee and is responsible for    
 reauthorizing the CPB, has indicated his interest in conducting hearings   
 early  
 in the legislative session on the future of public broadcasting.  Senator  
 Pressler has already publicly indicated his strong interest in eliminating 
 the CPB altogether.        
    
 Congressional hearings on the arts and humanities have been scheduled for  
 the following dates and are subject to change:

An act of *violence*?  Eric, get a life!  While I agree with the    
rest of your posting, the use of the word "violence" in relation    
to poetry seems out of place.  To whom is such violence     
directed.  I say "whom" because the term is large enough to     
burst through the relatively insular worlds of poetry, theory,      
and any other academic discourse.  People who have experienced      
real violence must react to your statement with puzzlement, to say      
the least.

    Well, at least no one has combined "Alfie" with the sheryy chicken--    
    egg question in a culinary way so as to make chicken alfredo and    
    I still think a musical comedy version of Beowulf with Bachrach tunes   
    would be a way to set up a privatized fund for poetry as it were    
    to the tune of Alfie "I could build a big MEAD HALL" and "What's

     BUFFALO (AHP) -- The day _apex of the M_'s headquarters went up    
 in flames, a bystander caught three of the children as they were thrown    
 from an upper-story window.    
     But just who that man was is in dispute, and the Office of     
 Monitored Sophistry doesn't know who should get a commendation for helping 
 save the children.         
     Four men and a woman have stepped forward, claiming to be the one  
 who caught the children Mar. 15 and carried them to safety.  A fourth child,   
 who jumped from the window after throwing the others, was hospitalized.    
     One of the men, Charles Bernstein, a 45-year-old migrant worker,   
 said he even has a blister, a burn mark and a suit that smells like smoke  
 to prove his story.        
     The Sophist's office plans to honor someone, they just don't know  
 who, said Marjorie Perloff, a spokeswoman for the Monitors.  Another   
 spokesman, Tom Mandel, suggested a bakeoff for determining the hero, but   
 this suggestion was rejected out of hand.  
     In any case, the injured child, Pam Rehm, will receive an award    
 when she is released from the hospital, where she is recovering from burns 
 over 40 percent of her body and scorched lungs. The other children

 escaped with minor bruises. The children are all twentysomething.      
     ``It's not really important,'' who caught the youngsters,      
 Perloff said. ``Believe me, I don't think nothing of it, as long   
 as the children are safe.''

    ...These extrapolated futures are in the great western      
    tradition of migration and despoilation that begun some     
    time before 1000 BC. All of the fresh starts on earth,      
    all of the fresh starts for humans, have been squandered.   
    This is our advantage. We have lost our innocence. We are   
    not Adam and Eve. THE IMAGINARY UNIVERCITY exists because   
    those who matriculate produce it. The students write all    
    of the books in its library, plan the syllabi of the    
    courses. We examine ourselves, we confer our own certificates   
    and degrees.        
    
    Now those who educate themselves as posthumans begin to     
    produce a nation. The course of study is difficult, the     
    chances for graduation are nil. If you want to study and act,   
    you will be welcome. OTHERWISE, PLEASE, STAY HOME AND       
    WATCH MTV. You should know, however, that our Nation of     
    Noise and Knowledge is at war with the United Nations and   
    all of its members. You will be required to undertake       
    dangerous missions. The stakes could not be higher.

     "It is all very well to enjoy the infinite     
    bliss of life after death, but it is preferable     
        not to have died at all."       
    
Poetry comes into existence in the absence of poetry, where words   
and language become the objects of a near infinite number       
of experiments designed to animate a long since passed away corpse.     
The experiments are interesting, but the corpse, however exquisite,     
is not. Even the stink, which for some time intoxicated the half-dead   
disciples of its cause, has become merely another of a countless number     
of environemntal signs of our collective desperation. The most serious  
of all work is the most comic, and the most comic the most tragic. The  
laughter is no longer joyful, but sardonic. Indeed, the most outwardly  
revolutionary of acts have become the most boring.      
    
We learn to live on breath alone. We learn not only to lie      
profoundly (as the disaffected poet said, and to ask ourselves,     
knowing this, whether mendacity is the best policy), but to understand  
that the key to the dissapperance of the world itself has itself,   
with the world, dissappeared. The aura surrounding the false    
joy of our recognition that we are all ghosts, has become       
as repetitive (and thus boring) as the pseudu-political act of revealing    
"the corpse" for what it really is. We learn not only to live,      
but to live lacking death, so that the over aestheticized funeral   
of poetry lacking poetry -- the stillborn child of politicized art --   
can finally come to an end.     
    
Life has never been more than life experimenting with life. Poetry, at best,    
has ecstatically been both a lamentation and celebration of that fact.

     WHO SAYS POETRY IS USED UP?    
    
 I went to a poetry conference sometime in the 70's at which there was  
one of those poetry readings that go on all night.  There were seven poems  
on the death of gold fish-- two in tetrameter couplets, one in Skeltonics, one  
which included three Latin names of medicinal herbs. I have really seen     
nothing like it since.  In fact shortly thereafter it became unfashionable to   
mention any thing at all.       
    
 We once had a gold fish named bubbles, who lived much of the time on   
our kitchen table, and she was mentioned in poems by at least three visiting    
poets with whom I sat after dinner discussing Skeltonics and arc welding    
and drinking coffee. In those days poets spoke of serious matters.      
    
 Bubbles lived a long life for a gold fish, and when she was grievously 
flushed, it was no longer considered fashionable to write on that theme, so I   
wrote about my 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk, thus, substituting the death    
of my car, named after a mighty raptor, for Bubbles. It was a cunning   
stratagem.  
    
 Your assingment for next week is to write on the vanity of human wishes.   
This is a theme even older and nobler than dying gold fish, which itself goes   
back to the Sung dynasty.  If you think you are not ready to handle such    
lofty material, you may attempt to remedy any of the lacks in recent poetry.

    To The Bloodless Refugees Of Emptiness  
    
        "Through the suburbs sleepless people stagger,  
        as though just delivered from a shipwreck   
        of blood."      
    -Garcia Lorca, The Dawn     
    
   What now exists as palpable global destiny? What are its markers,    
its sculpted crimson signs?     
    
   The psychic atmosphere implies a return to troubled fiefdoms,    
to monarchies trebeled by ferocious glints of bloody erosion. The   
sun continues to burn, the tides swarm across their shores with their   
sulphurs, while human continuity appears and disappears, like a     
netling grimness of ghosts. What arises from this startling anti-   
mass is the progressive neutering of the species. During this con-      
tinuing dearth of higher foci even lightning is misconstrued as     
mere electrical theatrics. World citizenry now progresses as an     
artificial epitath, as a spotted hyena starving on kelp, in an      
atmosphere of plight, hovering in balanced enigma. A spoiled voltage,   
a principle lacking in cohesion, where horizons disintegrate,       
where ideographs explode into darkness.     
    
   Humanity, like generic refugees, profanely strewn across a       
dome of exploded heliographs. The politicians crave for momentary   
incisions, for influential poison, much like staggered antelopes    
searching for sublime direction. For instance, a once dependant     
compass, now a locust eaten crystal. The collective path, a roving      
generation of hatchlings, devolving in sullen mental savannahs.     
We've witnessed many centuries of emigres, of disruptive holocaust      
phantoms. Now, all the fiestas and dieties somatically crippled,    
maundering like leaves across sudden hurricane waters, with their   
destinies entangled in a liminal brushfire pyroclastic.     
    
   At present, the shadow of our phylum wafting through an un-      
remitting mime osmotics. The linear goal, the abstracted referent,      
now remains increasingly hidden in tumultuous occlusion. And what   
is engendered by the latter, is the bloodless wake for uni-direc-   
tional propoganda...

 Rumour has it that in what may be an attempt to        
flee the ruins, many members of the royalty (including      
Prince Gizzi) are currently flocking to California in       
what has (with some tongue in some cheek) been recently     
dubbed "Project Restore Coast." While some of the       
native inhabitants fear that such an infusion of "avant-garde"      
sensibilities might not sit well in what has been called        
"one of the most alarming mixes of flabby pseudo-sixties        
idealism and crass mercantilism" ever witnessed, others     
have stated quite bluntly their favorable position:         
    
"Why not hire all of them and have the best poetics         
program in the nation?"     
    
 According to inside sources who spoke on condition     
of anonymity, Top Cop Bob Perelman -- perhaps because of        
his en-vogue role in the recent film "Postmodernism: The        
Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism"-- is the front-runner for the    
recently opened position at Lost Coast University. Some still       
contend, however, that despite Perelman's acting experience,    
the fresh young face of Supporting Actor Aaron Shurin       
 because of his wide-market appeal and, as  
one audience member put it, "ability to relate," is still in    
strong contention.      
    
 We've received no reports yet on the tryout performance    
of Cecil Giscombe, though rumour says that his reading      
went on, as scheduled, without incident, and that a good deal       
of fine wine was consumed by all parties involved.      
    
 We now await the arrival of Prince Gizzi.  
    
 Let us not fall into the sea   
 Til its best time...

I'll try again to communicate the necessity of a multi-part relationship    
between theory and poetry. They are inevitably connected in that every  
poem participates in one or another or several theories of poetry (one  
cannot write a poem that doesn't participate in any of several      
series of ideas about poetry), but poetry and theory are        
not the same. There can be many sophistic ways to describe this and it  
is easily misinterpreted as a spiritual relationship, but it's more by  
way of the range of ideas that poetry and poetics occupy each and both.     
I am trying to avoid analogy, but a picture in sets would easily explain    
this concept. To quote the song, it's okey dokey for identity to have   
several faces as we are many of us poets, editors, theorists, drivers,  
partners, workers..... James

Yes and you have raised what is for me the interesting question of what     
aspects of the poem can possibly separate, have an independent existence,   
from its theory, its author, its reader, its context. Is the poem an    
object that can in that sense be independent or are we talking about    
varying densities of language that participate in a discipline called   
poetry to a greater or lesser extent. To have the discussion properly we    
need to change its terms. I think the focus is now sharpened by your    
question. But I go too far too fast. Jmase

Dear Eric,  
    
Theory is formulated ideas about how things work. You don't     
need theory, or to be that theoretical, to have a context, to have lots of  
contexts, as I assume most people do, especially in this day and age.   
    
There is no single, proper context for a work of art. There is no single,   
proper context through which to read Shelley, Milton, Pound... It may be    
helpful to be aware of the contexts through which these poets viewed their  
own work (and art, life in general) but one does not need those contexts    
in order to be a receptive reader of their poetry.  Those who say   
otherwise are, to me, playing a big power game: My explanation is better    
than yours or my explanation is the right one and you are misguided. I  
know more than you do, so don't challenge me. My idea of art is better  
formulated than yours, so my view of art, or my art, is superior.   
    
Of course some peoples ideas are better formulated, and as explanations     
these may have more value. But the relationship between such explanations   
and the art is entirely problematic. The individual must have her own   
response to art, and the individual must have her own contexts for      
creating art. Explanations may be helpful or destructive in this endeavor.  
If I emphasize the negative here it is because others don't, and because I  
see this negative as looming large over the art today.      
    
I do appreciate your letter, your sincerity and your struggle. I agree  
that this discussion will not be resolved, and I agree that these tensions  
may be productive. But if you don't believe your own contexts (which    
neither defer to nor ignore the contexts of others) are all that are    
necessary for appreciating or creating art, then I believe you will miss    
out on the best art has to offer.

It's all very well to blame the greeks for theory, to be sure;      
but, the word entered their language from the phrase "they or       
we" which was inscribed on the banners of the brittano-aryans       
who invaded the poor pre-monumental scrub cult-ridden       
territory vastly earlier than previous references.

re: James' "every poem has a theoretical basis,"        
    
I think it's clear what that means if it is understood      
more or less along the lines of 'every statement has a      
theoretical basis' or 'every empirical fact has a       
theoretical basis.'         
    
Is there some further sense, special to poetry, in      
which each example has a theoretical basis (or  
implies a theory, or however you'd formulate it)?

C'mon Marc, I think my trope was clear. Haven't you ever violently      
jerked the steering wheel? Just meant that I thought, humbly,       
that it took a particularly violent jerk of the old noodle      
to separate the poem completely from its context.       
 As to "those of us who have been victims of violence,"     
what do you want? That I demonstrate that I've been a victim    
of violence? I have. That I demonstrate I've commited an act of     
violence? I have. How do I prove this in your opinion? A story?     
A police report? Snapshots? What would this prove? That I have a    
life, really truly?Would you believe it?    
 Thanks, Eric

Before James and Tom take off completely, or as they proceed to what are    
for them more interesting questions, I would like to mention that the   
fact that we can derive theories from works of art does not mean art does   
not have its own level. Art is much more than these theories, and that is   
one reason why it has its own level.

    "Real" vs. fake violence. As i write this, there is a woman screaming   
 next store at her 'lover' who is beating her. Physical vs. psychic--   
 it kinda puts my "merely mental' pain into perspective, yet there's

 that may be more PHYSICALLY violent than the GOVERNMENT oh so politely

Considering the recent rather odd discussion on "violence" I agree with you 
that there can be a "violence" to the way theory is used, as I should say   
there is a violence, perhaps more metaphysical (butnevertheless neccessary  
as all metaphysics, spirits, narratives, are neccessary) to a certain   
aestheticized position.     
 I don't argue that this is your position, incidentally. There was  
much in your posting I agreed with, as above, some I didn't:    
I think we can have a respectful disagreement. I think that's possible.

I'm starting to get a clearer picture of what is implied        
in James' dictum "every poem has a theoretical basis," &        
I thot to try it out on you all.    
    
Take a musical equivalent. Certainly, every sonata      
has a theoretical basis - in some version of the        
classical sonata as an idea, a form and ideal for       
musical expression. And this clearly is theoretical         
in a real sense. Every string quartet, symphony, etc.       
    
In the above, we are referring to the character of      
an art form historically. we are referring to European      
music from the late 18th century forward, continuing        
in varied ways to our own day when, still, someone      
writing a sonata wd be operating from a theory of       
the sonata, and a theory of music englobing sonata      
theory. Similarly for non-classical forms.  
    
So what is being indicated here is not an analytical        
fact, nor a god that's there willy nilly, but the       
developing character of an art discipline: its  
historical character, its self-expressed ideals 
and forms, and ways - parts of the ways - to    
approach and understand works within that discipline.       
And I think one cd rewrite the description of music         
to fit equally well the history of painting, again      
European painting.      
    
This is different too from my supposition or query      
whether James was just saying that as every expression      
or human act occurs within a cultural context which         
establishes at least a domain and horizon for its       
formal ideals of truth, appropriateness, appeal, etc.,      
so a poem, in that sense, implied a theory (or even         
theories).  
    
In a sense then, what James is argueing for is a        
historical poetics, that we understand poetry w/in      
the context of the extended internal and external       
conversation (challenge and response, as we say 
in the login world) which underlies its practice.       
This is strong, open and interesting. What does 
draw one to write poetry? How are terms (viz.   
spirit) interesting or operative in that    
conversation? His requirement of the apexers    
to nuance, to be subtle, not to be frontal, 
about their terms, is then a request for them to        
enter that conversation, and not a pan from the 
superior position of one who's been around  
long enough to know better, as it were (and in  
that formulation I think too that I'm trying    
to recontextualize some of what may come off as 
arrogance in my own contributions here).    
    
I haven't meant to represent James in this, but 
to open the ways his urgencies (and poetry is an        
urgent endeavor or nil) allow me to think and   
respond.

Yes, yes. This makes it clearer. And extremely interesting.     
 But, doesn't this, when it truly becomes poetry=theory, which      
incidentally is not what I think I hear James saying, become another    
form of intentionality? Ie., the poet intends this or that context?     
 Might we think of the poem, as I think Tom  indicates, as a dynamic    
in which these varying contexts, spirits, politics, narratives, metaphysics,    
and everything that works against these, circulate? Might we think      
ofthe poem, or any work of art, as an intricate process in which    
a multiplicity of concepts, with a both   small and a capital C occur?  
 This implies, to me, a poetry that works against stability, that   
is anything but static. And seems to me something that implies that     
thinking/creating/versifying/etc. never ends.   
 just a few scattered thoughts. Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

    James Sherry is undoubtedly correct that poetry cannot      
produce pure transparent immediacy, and it is therefore inevitably      
supplemented, consciously or unconsciously, with theory.        
    
    It seems to me, however, the following points might advance     
this thread of discussion.      
    
    1.  Poets are as responsible for their theory as they       
are for their art, and poets during the past twenty years have      
often abdicated the responsibility.  The theoretical results    
in philosophy as such and in the social and physical sciences       
are not irrelevant to poetry, but their use in poetics is       
limited at best.  The poet must think through the same issues       
but think through them in relation to the concrete practice of      
poetry.     
    
    2.  The poetry that is of enduring interest from Hesiod's   
_Theogony_ to Jack Clark's sonnets, Nate Mackey's _School of    
Uhdra_, Anne Waldman's _Iovis_, and Charles Stein's _The Hat    
Rack Tree_ incorporates its theory in the poems themselves.     
Theoretically complex poetry otherwise is  by definition academic.      
That is, the theoretical issues are always in play in the open form     
in which immediacy and thought are always in recursive      
interaction. This recursion is literally the motive of creative act.    
    
    3.  One of the reasons this becomes a difficult     
issue is that more and more poets find themselves employed in       
graduate education, a very different role to the academic poets of the  
50's (who often taught in small liberal arts schools or carried on the  
liberal-arts-school function in a large university).  It does seem to me    
we might find reasons to object to poems that illustrate this or that   
hot theory.  This kind of poetry seems to me at present  a serious      
plague.  It is comparable to the endless iambic tetrameter quatrains    
that illustrated the theoretical pronouncements of late Eliot.

Don--   
why not write them through as/in poetry? Or is that what you meant?  And    
if so then pinnning down the 2/3 split would seem esp. pressing (whose  
theoretically alert poetry is responsive and whose is just abdication?)

To unbeg this question, I guess, names might be named, or working   
criteria given.  That is: how distinguish "in general" between poetry in    
which   
"   the theoretical issues are always in play in the open form  
> in which immediacy and thought are always in recursive        
> interaction"  
and the poetry which merely "illustrates" a theory?  I guess it might be    
done in practice, but I bet such a distinction would be hard to align   
with something like "open form" unless that's either a School Cheer or,     
essentially, a tautology.

    In response to my claim that poets must think through       
the theoretical issues in relation to poetic practice, Tenney       
Nathanson asks,         
    
> why not write them through as/in poetry?  
    
    Yes, I would say the _great_ poets, in some sense the       
only poets worth _studying_, are those who set forth clearly in     
the poems themselves the circular dependency of immediacy       
and abstraction (Parmenides, Lucretius, Blake, and Olson are    
examples).  
    
    Other poetry is read as journalism (i.e. information set    
forth in the context of the large unstated prejudices of the day)   
or as distraction (poetry as tv).   
    
    It does seem, however, that an intermediate discourse       
is sometimes necessary.  Olson's _SPecial View of History_,     
for example.    
    
    The distinction between poetry in which the theoretical     
issues are always in play and poems that merely illustrate a theory     
is in practice quite clear.     
    
    Poetry of the former type takes full responsibility     
for the theory.  Of course, this means that the poem that       
addresses its own theoretical base is still dependent upon      
the theory that makes that poem possible.  Serious poetry,      
however, takes full responsibility for the loop, which      
is its central motive.      
    
    Poetry of the latter type, takes the fact that any      
poem must depend upon a theory to dodge responsibility for      
the poem at hand.  Thus, poetry becomes a reliance upon     
various algorithms of novelty.  The poet feels assured that     
this work must be important, if he or she only had time     
to think up or at least articulate the theory on which it       
depends.

I believe that the "little lower layer" theory is Starbuck's. Ahab's    
point of view is much more black and white, while Ishmael's theory is a     
third one about the relative values of observation and humanity. This is    
a theory common to many of the 19th century writers and much discussed. The 
opposition of love to theory is a particularly savage one that justifies    
a lot of abuse and anti-intellectual essentializing. It implies that a  
lover can't have a theory. Aren't we all capable of divesting ourselves     
of these fictions of hierarchy and digesting a mutable world view? James

I, for one, have some problem with the word "art" when it comes up in   
relation to theory. Theory I can see. There's a practical quality to    
it. I mean you sit down and type it out. Whether the poem precedes      
theory or the theory proceeds the poem is probably moot. But when does  
the poem turn into "art"? Isn't this something left way behind      
somewhere? Here's what the _American Heritage_ has to say about it:     
    
   1. Human effort to imitate, supplement, alter, or counteract     
   the work of nature. 2.a. The conscious production or arrangement     
   of sounds, colors, forms, movements, or other elements in a      
   manner that affects the sense of beauty, specifically the    
   production of the beautiful in a graphic or plastic medium.      
    
So maybe that's my difficulty with the term. It brings up the spectre   
of those terms like the "beautiful" and "nature" which seem foreign to  
activities that might have some application to our present      
gatherings...

this is such a knotty issue, but i'll risk a few premature assertions...    
    
it's probably worth pointing out here that much of what is taken as     
properly theoretical these days, academically speaking, is in fact theory   
about theory... metatheory, that is, of one sort or another...      
    
now not to conflate terms further, BUT theoretical practice, as i understand    
same, ultimately must account for itself... the logic, that is, is not one  
of a hermetic system (regarding which one may cite any number of related    
proofs contra) but one, rather, of recognized and working (conscious and quasi  
-conscious etc.)        
mutual interrelations of signifying practices with somewhat differing aims...   
    
i say "somewhat" because there is, on the surface of it, no recourse to any but 
a generic   
preference that places, say, 'art' over here and 'theory' over there... now 
in practice there ARE of course distinctions, and distinctions such that one    
may be led to believe that art *must* be over here and theory *must* be over    
there... but what justification, other than an empirical (and perhaps anecdotal)
claim as to the intrinsic primacy of art, can anybody make, finally, that does  
not bring with it either a (however carefully worked out) faith or an   
institutional(-historical) predisposition, and more than likely both?... that   
is, the 'art vs. theory' discussion is a vexed issue precisely because there    
would seem to be no overarching consensus as to what we might hope either   
practice to accomplish (in practice... and yeah, "we")...       
    
i grant that the past couple of decades has witnessed the erosion of artistic   
authority (if you will) in the name largely of theory... surely this is part    
of the general trend, that of the movement of more and more intellectual work   
into the "academy"... but just as surely this need not necessarily blind    
anybody to the interdependencies at work between these symbolic-material    
'realms'... 
    
so to pose the question of what it is that art does over and against what it is 
that theory does---if i may be allowed to wax utilitarian for a moment---is to  
ask, essentially, how it is we regard the place of intellectual work of one 
sort or another given our respective public/private sites...

    Is Ron saying thus that if Parmenidies would have recognized the    
    "presence" of the signifier that he would have been able to prove   
    that language can produce pure immediacy?????       
    And what does this "pure immediacy" signify for people?     
    Can immediacy be said to be pure?   
    Should we theorize immediacy?   
    Is irony the expression of immediacy on the 'level' of theory?      
    And what of the "circle"?       
    Don Byrd spoke of the "circular dependency of immediacy and     
    abstraction"--but if the "circle", an "ideal form" that doesn't     
    exist "in nature", is an abstraction, this mutuality privileges     
    the abstract (and is perhaps not mutual)... 
    Circle line, vicious circle, Aristotle's god of pure contemplation,     
    Short circuit. Spinning one's wheels without "intentionality"   
    Will the circle be unbroken? When you get circulars in the mail     
    do you consider them junk mail? IS THERE a circle, an "inner    
    circle," "The pleasures of merely circulating"--the Blakian     
    vortex, girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool?       
    Is the circle a chain, a golden chain, should we TRUST ANYTHING?

I'm sorry Ron. I'm confused. How is the signifier "present?"    
 My understanding, admittedly limited and admittedly "academic"     
(why do I, as this I write more and more on this list,feel the need     
for quotations?) is that the signifier is absent and exposes the    
absence of the signified? Please explain.

   "Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee

Captain Ahab, seems blasephemous."      
   "Hark ye yet again,--the little lower layer. All visible objects,

Imagine this, James, that at the moment the poem enters the world,      
rather than having a theory as its basis (as you put it), it    
simultaneously engenders a theory, a counter-theory, a non-theory,      
several anti-poems, non-poems, and counter-poems, and in a sort     
clinamenic, rhizomatic fracturing that spreads across the face of   
the world as we know it, multiplies, swerves, joins, splits into a      
massive multiplicitous joyful inscrutablility in whose features we may  
vaguely make out something resembling the possibilty of a white whale   
sporting amongst what Ishmael called "young Leviathan amours of the deep."  
    
I saw something like this once at the particle accelerator at       
Livermore Labs--an image of an electron which, as it approached the     
speed of light, disappeared completely from our space/time continuum    
(where the hell did it go?), only to reappear in a shower of subatomic  
particles, anti-particles, non-particles, and god knows what else.      
    
Bottom line, as the Duke said: "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got   
that swing. Dowop shewop dowop shewop dowop shewop do."

Since Moby Dick got in between James Sherry on one side and Don Byrd and    
Mike B on the other (the latter playing Ahab as theory off against      
Ishmael as poesis and freedom, as I understand it, it's worth drawing   
attention to Don Pease's terrific chapter on Moby Dick and what he calls    
the "cold war  consensus," in /Visionary Compacts/.  The point being that   
Ahab, in "cold war criticism," is figured as totalitarian will, from whom   
Ishmael's liberal symbolism (allegory versus symbol gets mobilized in the   
criticism as well) liberates "us."  Pease is of course critical of this     
enabling dichotomy, and thus lines up roughly w James S. and against Mike   
B at least.  So that poetry as opposed to (hegemonic? totalizing?) theory   
would if not be part of, then at least seem to have an interest in      
appealing to an enabling fifty year old liberal politics of containment.    
Curious.

    BUFFALO (AHP) -- The ``mumthing different'' about ``the     
M'' has come under fire from poetry abuse prevention advocates      
who contend it has caught the fancy of underage readers.        
    Critics in at least 10 states have complained to Buffalo's      
Poetics Program about the radically transparent verbiage, saying it     
has a sour aftertaste like baby formula but a slightly higher       
confusion content than Poetics' own original brew.      
    They say M is increasingly consumed by juveniles, and has   
fostered false rumors in some areas that it is undetectable by      
breathalyzer tests used to prosecute poets with slurred speech.     
    ``The product is clearly designed to seem different from    
regular language poetry,'' said Mark Wallace, executive director of     
the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. ``It's

enticing young people to consume poetic verbiage, kids that otherwise   
might not read the stuff.       
    ``I think it sets a pattern of the poetic verbiage industry     
constantly testing the waters with different kinds of products to   
see if they can find ways of expanding what has been a stagnant     
market.''   
    The Poetics Program has responded to the criticism with     
an aggressive program emphasizing M is for adults only. It has sent     
letters to community leaders, book reviewers and magazine editors   
stating that M will register on breathalyzer equipment.     
    ``There are always things kids are going to find appealing      
about what adults do,'' said Poetics spokeswoman Charlotte Pressler.    
``We feel we have very effectively addressed all of the issues      
overall.''  
    ``apex of the M,'' packaged in a red cover, splashed onto   
the poetic scene in Spring 1994, catching on in a slick, quick-moving   
editorial campaign where words with a New Age connotation were      
substituted for the more formalist vocabulary of traditional    
language writing.

    M has a confusion content of 3.7 percent by weight, compared    
with language poetry's confusion content of 3.6 percent by weight,      
Pressler said.  
    The transparent verbiage has become one of the most successful  
new products in the industry, and has been credited for much of Poetics'    
recent revenues.        
    Poetry abuse prevention advocates say they began noticing   
increased M consumption among juveniles last spring.        
    In Albany, N.Y., poetics police reported large quantities of    
M at juvenile drinking parties, said Betsy Burns, program coordinator   
for the county's Drawing the Line on Underage Poetry Use.       
    That county also is where the false rumors about the    
breathalyzer detection spread to the point that Burns' group made a     
video of a literary critic (Jeff Hansen) getting confused by M. The     
video showed the test detecting this confusion.

    Since the prevention efforts began, there has been a    
decrease in the number of complaints, Burns said. One factor    
could be that more parents have become aware that M is adult    
verbiage, she said.         
    Kevin McGee of the Marin Institute, a poetry abuse      
prevention group in Marin County, Calif. said he has noticed an     
increase in M use among younger college students who have been      
``very taken by the editorials and have embraced M.''       
    ``The whole `mumthing different' is for a generation    
that's looking to define itself but doesn't know what to say,''     
said McGee. ``It plays off that myth that something like poetics    
won't affect you the same way free verse or hard poetry will.''     
    Inquiries to the Poetics Program about M peaked at about    
200 in May; in the last three months of 1994, inquiries totaled     
about 10 a month, said Pressler.    
    ``We feel we have very effectively addressed the issues     
overall,'' she said.        
    Yunte Huang, group manager of confusion issues at Poetics,      
said the program has financed some poetry abuse prevention aimed at

Generally I like to refer to Deleuze & Guattari, but I do believe that  
the relations between/among "book" & "literature" are entirely      
problematic, and I can more easily embrace the concept of book as machine   
than literature as one.     
    
I also find most statements that, as D. Byrd says, poems "incorporate"  
theory to be too pat. They may do so, but hopefully in a way which      
enables both theory and poetry to be anything but dogmatic and      
inflexible. 
    
Please explain, Spencer, what "level" art has. Art has its own level, is    
this like one of Dante's circles in the Inferno, or somewhere up some   
other cosmological ladder? Can art or theory really be divided so clearly   
from one another or from any number of other practices we can name, like    
work, state, love, morality?

    That is, Wittgenstein gave up the possibility of presentational     
immediacy and the transcendental signifier, and decided to use ordinary     
language...  The proof is not the existence of a transcendental sign,   
but that, if there _is_ a transcendental sign, it cannot be spoken.     
    
    I do not understand the demonizing of the transcendental    
signifier in Language poetry theory.  In fact, as attractive as the     
idea is from an emotional point of view, it is not an important     
idea in western logic. Those who have taken it seriously have       
tended, like Wittgenstein, to give up on the idea.      
    
    If it is too rigorous for scientific logic, its     
existential requirements are too stringent for poetry, which is     
after all predicated as a fiction. Even the poet who claims a       
transcendental signifier does not.

What role does the differing institutional (academic and otherwise)     
authority given to "theory" and "art" in a context in which they are    
definitely understood as separate have to do with this current debate?  
I'm tempted to say that if you want to be listened to, you better call  
yourself a theory.      
    
    We could probably use the words "theory" and "art" anyway we want   
(would that make me Wittgensteinian, in a sense?) but that doesn't mean     
anybody else is going to ( I know that does make me Wittgensteinian).

     SAN FRANCISCO (AHP) -- This time he has a reason to leap.      
     Watten, the killer whale made famous by the film ``Free Barry,''   
 is heading toward a new home in Michigan and eventual freedom, his     
 owners announced yesterday.    
     The Berkeley amusement park where Watten has lived for the     
 past decade signed an agreement donating the 3.5-ton mammal to the     
 Free Barry-Watten Foundation, which plans to eventually free him in    
 waters off Japan after a rehabilitation period at the Wayne State      
 Aquarium in Detroit.       
     The amusement park said the 15-year-old whale, captured off    
 the coast of Japan at age 2, has performed for over a hundred visitors     
 over the past 10 years. Efforts to free him have been underway since   
 the Poetry Flash film was released.

     ``Watten will be the only captive lang-po whale that doesn't   
 have to do shows or perform,'' Patrick Phillips, director of the   
 foundation, said at a news conference yesterday.       
     The foundation plans to move him in November.      
     In many ways, Watten is like a typical human teen-ager --      
 he's got skin problems, has grown (to 21 feet), and now wants a    
 girlfriend.    
     ``He requires more space, different conditions and also a      
 companion,'' said Svetlana Alpers, a spokeswoman for the Berkeley      
 habitat Representations.       
  Phillips said the park ``received letters and proposals of    
 aid from all over the world.'' He said it waited until receiving ``an  
 absolute guarantee'' that conditions in the killer whale's new home    
 would be adequate.         
     Phillips said the entire project will cost ``a heck of a   
 lot of moolah'' over four years and include Watten's ``relocation,     
 rehabilitation, possible mating, possible liberation and       
 investigations into the whereabouts of the family of Watten.''     
     That includes funds to build an expensive, 2-million-gallon

 tank at the Michigan aquarium.     
     Experts said Watten needs to be trained gradually for life     
 at sea -- weaned, for example, from eating dead fish to eating live    
 ones.  
     ``Watten, who has passed all his life away from the sea,   
 would encounter serious difficulties feeding himself, caring for   
 himself and surviving by himself in a hostile environment,''       
 Phillips said.         
     So far, the foundation has collected about half the needed     
 funds, including a generous grant from Poetry Flash and George     
 Lakoff Inc., creators of ``Free Barry.''   
     The money raised includes a small sum from former students     
 at San Francisco State Elementary School, who conducted a      
 letter-writing campaign and saved pennies. 
     They began sending letters in last month to prominent      
 businessmen and individuals, including marine sociobiologist       
 Jacques de Certeau.        
  Certeau sent no money, but praised the children for their     
 efforts. Singer Jimmy Buffett sent $500.

Subject:  (Fwd) (Fwd) Re: (Fwd) Re: parmenides & wittgenstein   
    
Perhaps this comment by Jarret Leplin may help to clarify the       
Wittgenstein/Langpo connection:     
    
     ". . . the falsehood (if that's that 'F' means) of q       
does not establish the falsehood of p>q (assuming that '>' is       
intended to represent conditionalization).  A conditional may be    
either true of false consistently with the falsehood of its     
consequent.  Also, 'it cannot be spoken' is certainly not       
contradictory.  Of course, there are few things of which it is      
natural to say that they are spoken: languages, certain     
incantations, or perhaps texts that would normally be read rather   
than spoken.   Many languages cannot be spoken by many      
people; perhaps some - ancient ones, for example - cannot be spoken at  
all.  Whether or not it cannot be spoken depends on the referent of     
'it'; there's nothing wrong with the form.  More generally, to assert   
that something cannot be spoken is not to speak it, nor is to deny      
that something can be explained or expressed to explain or express      
it. "

Also thanks to Don Byrd who at least refers to the next point in this   
discussion which is the multiplicity of relations between theory and    
poetry in the various poetries which this group is fond of referencing. A   
matrix of readings of poetries with their theoretical biases would be   
interesting to me, although obviously hypothetical as someone pointed out   
already.    
    
But as I have said the more articulate new responses today (Monday) only    
make we want the more to discuss how the main question for poets today,     
at least from my point of view, is the relationship of poetry to other  
disciplines to the shared, extended texts of science, law, fiction, news,   
philosophy, politics, medicine. This question applies to the role of    
poetry in the society and culture, to the uniqueness of poetry which Tom    
raises below, to the lineage of poetry itself which cannot be described     
in any one way because each new set of poetries redefines the history...    
    
I guess I don't think that there is any one way to view poetry so Tom's     
question can't be answered from here. But the relationship of poetry to     
other disciplines is periodically said to lead nowhere and someone last     
week referred to Lamb or another 19th century critic's approach that we     
need a point of view to avoid chaos.    
    
I guess chaos is chiefly what I'm after in the sense of a term that does    
not have apparent order but rather an underlying order and is both      
generative of order and subltly influencing more overt kinds of order   
with its own subversive similarities at different "levels" or on    
different scales.       
    
I don't have a good way to talk about this yet, but wanted to address the   
issue to the group, especially now that a wider purview is being taken on   
the subject.

Here's a question or two for (primarily) the non-males who read this

Why do you lurk without posting?    
    
What would it require to change this?   
    
Are there other venues (listserv discussion groups in particular) where     
you are more active?        
    
If so, what do they do differently?

p.s. I also had missed the connection but 'O Sole Mio' is sang as 'Just One 
Cornetto' for a Walls Ice Cream ad on TV here which does seem to provide    
the basis for a sustainable connection, via this as yet unsubstantiated     
Pokey flavour from Auckland, between East London and Naples.    
    
Questions follow:       
    
1.The East London version always starts with 'you put you left (whatever)   
leg in' and so on - I'm worried that the folk myth has got lost in its  
translation to connect Pokey with a reorientation towards the right foot,   
can you or anybody else here possibly clear this up? Otherwise the      
ramifications of possible relations between Losely (high culture ice cream  
manufacturers but arguably Cockney rhyming slang for Mosely - as in Oswald  
and his blackshirts, resurgent in East London even as we post) and      
Mussolini will lead to melted sleep.

Maybe the relation of theory practice is like the relation of strategy

it's like the relation of body to mind, or then again, mind to body (the best

Ron Silliman's question (why do so few women on this list post) tempts me to    
delurk briefly.         
    I enjoy reading e-mail, including the poetics list -- but this  
form of communication, like any other, seems to have its strengths and limits.  
    E-mail seems to me to be a good way to ask specific questions and   
communicate specific kinds of information rapidly and effectively (book lists,  
the Freely Espousing communiques, calls for papers).        
    It's also a good way to argue positions for the most part already   
formed. The quick cut-and-thrust of single-screen messages, though, seems as    
though it might hamper the reception of more tentative or exploratory postings. 
    People read their e-mail fairly quickly, and I don't think many     
people save it for later reading or download it to a printer. Disk space might  
be limited, too -- at least it is at UB. So, for the most part, once a message  
is scanned, however it's scanned, it's gone. Not much opportunity for   
re-vision.  
    So, apart from its bulletin-board functions, e-mail seems to work best  
for people who like to respond quickly and concisely to well-defined arguments. 
    
    I prefer to have a good bit of time to think over a written message,    
and to publish it in a format that allows for re-reading. I've stung myself in  
the past by offering too-rapid reactions; but I've also found that in sharp 
debate, reactive responses come to dominate over exploratory ones. So I find it 
best to work through my own often somewhat divergent responses to current   
topics either off-list, or in work written for print publication, or in     
conversation with friends.      
    Possibly this is a gender difference; I'm not sure it's entirely that.  
There's also the uneasy position of divergences that don't quite attain to the  
sharp clarity of an oppositional statement. I tend to diverge in just this way  
-- should I call it "radical opacity"? :-) So I tend to lurk on lists,  
including this one. Apart from this post.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    
    
    
*Correction to Arts Wire Congressional Schedule*        
    
On 10 Feb, Marshall Reese was kind enough to forward a posting from Arts    
Wire that included a tentative schedule of Congressional action affecting   
the NEA/NEH/IMS.        
    
The first item in that schedule, a Senate Subcommittee hearing of public    
NEA witnesses and NEH/IMS administration and public witnesses, has been     
moved back ten days.  The Education, Arts & Humanities Subcomittee (chaired 
by James Jeffords, R-VT) will begin hearing these witnesses on 23 February. 
    
The relevant hearing this week is Thursday's meeting of the House Interior  
Appropriations Subcommittee (chair Ralph Regula, R-OH).  Walter Cronkite,   
Ken Burns, and David McCullough are schedule to testify.        
    
*Good News from LitNet*     
    
Anne Burt at LitNet reports that 15,000 pieces of pro-NEA mail were     
delivered last week to the district office of Senator Slade Gorton (who     
chairs the Senate Appropriations Interior SubCom).  Someone's doing a hell  
of a job organizing out there!      
    
Through a wonderful sequence of events, Anne has also gotten Tower      
Records/Books to commit to distributing LitNet materials in *all* their     
stores nationwide.  The corporation has even volunteered to do displays     
about the NEA in each store.  Once this plan is implemented, it may be  
useful to give local store managers a call & see what else they might be    
willing to do.  In any case, a quick thank- you call seems warranted.   
    
*Bad News from the Midwest*     
    
The Mid-America Arts Alliance has "broken rank" with the National AAA and   
publicly called for the restructuring of the NEA.  I don't have the details 
on this development, but the basic import of the gesture is easily enough   
understood.  When you have State Arts Councils calling for their own    
"defunding" (they receive roughly 35% of their budget from NEA), things are 
bleak indeed.   
    
    
*Action Hotlines*       
    
When I spoke to a representative of the American Arts Alliance late last    
week, I was told that traffic on their 900 number was healthy (no precise   
figures were mentioned).  Today, however, another source--not inside the    
AAA--reported that traffic is in fact disappointingly light (the figure     
mentioned was 3,500 calls since start-up).  
    
While we feel that these Hotlines fall on the passive/expensive side of     
possible efforts to preserve federal arts funding, they do represent    
something like the "least you can do."  If you live in a state whose    
elected representatives in Congress oppose the NEA/NEH/IMS, please make an  
effort to circulate the numbers.    
Once again, the numbers are:    
    
Emergy Committee to Save Culture and the Arts   
1-900-370-9000  
(An operator will explain that the call costs $1.99 a minute and will ask   
permission to send a mailgram in the caller's name to his or her    
Representatives and Senators.  Estimated total cost: $6-$8)     
    
Cultural Advocacy Campaign Hotline      
1-800-651-1575  
(An operator will describe the message and explain that for $9.50 three     
Western Union mailgrams will be hand-delivered the next day to the caller's 
Representatives and Senators).      
    
Note that neither of these systems permits you to direct mailgrams to   
Congressional representatives outside your state/district.      
    
*NEH Annual Report*         
    
On Friday, 9 February, President Clinton passed along the NEH annual report 
(1994) to the House and Senate with a brief message summarizing the "good   
works" performed by the Endowment in the past year.  We reproduce Clinton's 
message below:  
    
To the Congress of the United States:   
   I am pleased to present to you the Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the 
National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Federal agency charged     
with fostering scholarship and imparting knowledge in the humanities.  Its  
work supports an impressive range of humanities projects.       
  These projects can reach an audience as general as the 28 million who 
watched the documentary Baseball, or as specialized as the 50 scholars who  
this past fall examined current research on Dante.  Small local historical  
societies have received NEH support, as have some of the Nation's largest   
cultural institutions.  Students from kindergarten through graduate school, 
professors and teachers, and the general public in all parts of the Nation  
have been touched by the Endowment's activities.        
    As we approach the 21st century, the world is growing small and its 
problems seemingly bigger.  Societies are becoming more complex and     
fractious.  The knowledge and wisdom, the insight and perspective, imparted 
by history, philosophy, literature, and other humanities disciplines enable 
us to meet the challenges of contemporary life.

Dear Ron,   
    I read the list primarily for the anti-heg stuff, i.e. I will   
laugh at least once today.  I would like to add to Charlotte    
Presler's remarks the following:    
    
    Generally, the mechanics of vms mail editing is not intuitive.  
I have spent the last week learning how to file mail to folders.  I     
learned the ins and outs of engine repair faster.       
    
    The nature of these lists - they are generally anonymous.   
Although the poetics list relies more heavily on the signifying     
name than others, I feel like I'm walking into a room with a blind-     
fold on surrounded by others whose state is unknown.        
    
    Under these conditions what is a toy and what a weapon? I've    
noticed there are whole trees devoted to teaching people how to inflect     
their remarks by using 8-) >   type symbols.  Obviously this media,     
or the people that write how-to books about it recognize there is some  
problem having to do with what is written and its intent.       
    
    This list by its title invites writers to perform.  So far, I've seen   
 a series of challenges, duels and target practice.  It is a public     
arena where we watch our gang try to make something of it.  I suspect   
that if any real conversation gets generated, it does so off the public     
screen.  I have found such correspondence through this list, and value  
that.   
    
    Normally, I would post this to your e-mail address.  But in     
the spirit of your inquiry, I reveal myself.

I turned off my computer for a few days and here I have 50 new messages     
from the poetics list. Boy, it's like you turn away for a minute and you    
fall behind. What does this mean, and is it a coincidence that nearly all   
these messages are being written by men?    
    
Since I was pretty involved in the discussion last week, and since parts    
of the discussion over the weekend do relate to things I said, I do wish    
to respond--but forgive me if I am selective. There is no intention here    
to be reductive.        
    
Don Byrd says that poets who are not also self-professed theoreticians are  
irresponsible (my paraphrase, which I hope is not going to start another    
argument). I disagree strongly with this statement. I think Mr.  Byrd's     
position here is significant because I believe something like this is what  
helps to underpin the privileging of theory which I see in Tom and James,   
and maybe others.       
    
I believe poetry and all art is an attempt at world making. It is on its    
own level because the worlds it creates are of a different order--from the  
world or worlds we live our entire lives in on one side, and all our    
explanations on another. To follow the analogy of this definition through:  
Is this multivalent world we live our entire lives in irresponsible     
because it did not come with a set of clear instructions?  Is God   
irresponsible because s/he doesn't make herself clear (to most of us, at    
least), because s/he doesn't give all the people who use her creation a     
set of authentic, identifiable explanations to guide them, because she  
doesn't even make her existence clear to a large percentage of these    
people? If so, then I opt for irresponsibility over responsibility.     
    
I imagine Mr. Byrd will not be enamored with my reasoning, or the   
implications I draw from my world-making analogy. I admit that this     
comparison doesn't do justice to all the slipperiness of the issue at   
hand. I am not simply against responsibility any more than I think Mr.  
Byrd is simply for it. Obviously, judgment and balance of some sort is  
called for. The problem is, who do we trust to make these judgments? My     
Byrd says "the poetry that is of enduring interest ...incorporates its  
theory in the poems themselves." Of course that's true. In fact, I think    
that's one of the few points which has been made in this discussion that    
everyone may agree on. But there's no objective or foolproof way to gauge   
which poems do this successfully and which do not. On the contrary, these   
critical judgments tend to be notoriously subjective. This is a problem     
that most today play down or ignore or are downright naive about. I would   
not single out Mr. Byrd here, but at the same time I don't see that he's    
made much, if any, progress against this barrier. (As with Lew Daly, there  
seems to be quite a gap between Mr. Byrd's dramatic call for a new      
direction and the poets who he says might signal this direction. In both    
cases some good and/or accomplished poets, but it's difficult to believe    
that these midcareer poets represent anything that radically new or     
superior, compared with a lot of others working today.)     
    
James Sherry says that the problem with my statement about art being on     
its own level is it's hierarchical. James writes this in all caps, which I  
did not appreciate, but which I think may say more than the content of his  
statement. Since I first disagreed with James, I have gotten a series of    
responses in which he has expressed his impatience with me. James seems to  
think our disagreement is the result of my bad listening or my lack of  
knowledge or my inability to comprehend what he is saying. There may be     
some misunderstanding, but no more on my side than his. And I have not  
written statements in all caps, nor have I spoken down to him or implied    
annoyance that he would question me or my understanding of these issues.    
    
I have argued for art as being more than all these explanations. In doing   
this I have been drawn into the discourse. O.K. I admit that; I take    
responsibility for it. I even admit that my position is theoretical, in a   
sense. But please don't forget why I have made my statements. I am      
concerned about the limits and dangers of this discourse, which are all     
the greater for not being fully acknowledged. I see a need for questioning  
the high-minded tone and attitudes of self-importance which go along with   
much of this discourse. In saying I have more faith in art than in this     
discourse, I am accused of being hierarchical. But I believe it is those    
who have elevated this discourse that are putting themselves on a higher    
plane.  
    
Art or poetry is much more than this discourse (anyone's discourse), just   
as life is much more than the formulated knowledge we each or all have of   
it. In being more, art separates itself, but not so in the minds of some    
who speak so knowledgeably, so authoritatively on this forum. They prefer   
to argue about explanations that can never be effectively proven,   
explanations which may be opposed to the more expansive spirits of life     
and change and freedom and mystery that the best art celebrates. Missing    
this or deemphasizing it, no wonder they think so much of their     
explanations.

The meaning of "art" for me comes from all the art I've experienced, not    
the dictionary definition, nor anyone else's definition, semantic or    
otherwise. I believe this is true for other people too, even if they    
don't admit it. And that is why the word or concept does not become     
passe. I have used the word "art" interchangeably with poetry in much of    
the recent theory/practice discussion because I don't think the issues  
here (at least the aspects that I've tried to address) are exclusive to     
poetry.

James, I was quoting Mathew Arnold in 1849 who was obviously getting    
nervous towards his candle of coherence in expressing (to Clough) his need  
(which he hoped was more widely shared:     
'to begin with an idea of the world in order not to be prevailed over by    
the world's multitudinousness'      
or rewritten / broken many ways     
'to begin with an idea of the world in order not        
to be prevailed over by the world's multitiduinousness' and so on into  
variations. 
But then Arnold was the author of 'Culture and Anarchy'. Useful multiple    
edges inside that title too. This quote is contextualised by the 1851 Great 
Exhibition, of course  - that first imperialist garnering of photography,   
science, technology, art, design, botany and more under 'one roof'. A   
multitude of information and influences and interfaces. The 'other' in  
'our' midst.    
    
Certainly 'English' poetry, with notable exceptions has resisted that   
multitudinousness  -  not even through adopting an idea or even ideas in    
order but by retreating behind the net curtains of sentiment and identity.  
Chaos theory and analogy is wearing a tad thin, though I understand your    
condimental drift. To go along that path a little (and it's a steal) it's   
agreed that there is no possibility of accurately measuring the coastline   
of Ireland because even if all other terms and variables could be   
established as common at the outset by the time the full trajectory had     
been traversed the actuality would have changed through process of erosion. 
I'm keen on a poetry which engages with such slippage and makes its process 
sing. The inter-relations of inextricable detail between poetry and theory  
are those between positive and negative space or between improvisation and  
composition  -  
    
Or as Raymond Chandler put it (I like these hard-boiled-noses / heavy   
academic references best):      
'down at the corner was dust in the air, as though a car had passed that way'   
    
    
good to meet up with you again

Ron, you're right. It's an issue. But it seems to me, from a rough count,   
that the imbalance of posts approximates the imbalance in subscribers to    
the list. About 1:6? Approaching that level of discrepancy (well maybe 1:4) 
has been echoed both among practitioners and audience at events in England. 
Although    
there has been movement towards improvement over the past three years or so.    
    
I'm keen on using and exploring the use of e-mail having been such a    
terrible correspondent for ever since. I'm new to this list and am enjoying 
the mix of agendas. Putting in the necessary time with technology is not a  
boys own thing. There is a problem though to be acknowledged between the    
speed of posting and more reflective responses. It puts extra pressure on   
the reflective to be more 'polished' which is unfortunate. The rough and    
conversational aspects of this site for exchange and engagement is what     
attracts myself and probably creates resistance in others. No suggestion    
here that reflection is gendered.   
    
However it might be the train-spotting or jazz buff nature of rapid     
response postings which is most gendered and off-putting. And anonymity     
might help a lot.       
    
None of this is an attempt to explian away. Glad you've raised it and hope  
the response is constructive as it appears to be so far.        
In anticipation  -  I never saw it as a health spa, can't we meet somewhere 
more social? Ira recently raised a clear point about what passes    
unchallenged here.

At work, I'm using Lotus Notes and it only tells me that these messages

Subject:  Re: p>q re parmenides, etc.   
    
ok, i can't resist this thread:     
    
p>q statements are false ONLY if p is true and q is false... which means,   
against a truth-table grid, that only 25% of the logical possibilities  
are false...    
    
which means that it's logically (and statistically) likely to say something 
logically true given this construction....  
    
BUT recall (if this is old hat for any of you) that p>q is not a statement  
of causality per se... that is, it's not that p affects (or effects) q...   
though of course the logic behind why p>q is true whenever p is false   
would seem to invoke a mild form of causality...        
    
it's not surprising that logic yields counter-intuitive results (science    
and engineering do too)... or perhaps one's intuition needs to be twisted   
some...     
    
as to the example given, "if a and not a, then (whatever)," this would be   
said to be vacuously true in that "if a and not a" is taken ALWAYS (in this 
logic, anyway) to be false... or perhaps that should better read "true  
vacuously"...   
    
what's interesting to me is why this has become a topic on poetics... i mean,   
it's baby logic in philosophy circles, and even computational theory textss 
make short order of this stuff... i'm not saying that it's irrelevant, but  
i am saying that i find it a curious thread around here... perhaps it's the 
reference to wittgenstein, but i mean, like, he said so damned much, ultimately,
    
anyway, you will all probably note that i find it titillating myself, given 
my former math. background...       
    
so mea culpa!...

Subject:  gender...     
    
i guess i feel mouthy today...      
    
i like ron silliman's having called attention to the fact that this     
list has    
taken on a boys' club aura... this has happened, inevitably, to most    
lists   
on which i've participated... given the reality of something like   
80-90%  
internet traffic being generated by males, it's a statistical       
likelihood  
that most posts will be from men... but this doesn't explain the    
relative    
silence of women in a given venue...    
    
what generally happens is what's happening now---one of the men (in     
this case   
ron) notices that women are not participating, and posts this fact...   
and a   
few women write in and attempt to convey some sense of their feeling    
not     
esp. motivated to participate... not always, but usually one of the     
reasons     
given is the fact that they find the space to be 'agon-izing,' a    
"series of  
challenges," as b. cass clarke has it... that is, usually, but not      
always,     
some element of gendering, however subtly construed, would seem to be   
at      
work in creating a less-than-generous ambience (shall we say)...    
    
and usually, but not always, a few male subscribers react rather    
unfavorably 
to this charge, and a few react rather favorably... and usually, but    
not     
always, this leads to a further dispute twixt the men, again...     
    
i tend these days to try to understand these virtual environments in    
terms   
of a dialectic (initially, anyway) of immersion and withdrawal---what   
could   
be taken as a requisite couple for artistic work in general... in any   
case,   
i've noted consistently that discussions in which the disputants are    
male    
invariably draw on those theories that manage to abstract out the   
more personal   
site(s) from which (whatever) work emerges... there would seem to be    
the need    
to invoke a lineage of thinkers, most of them male, a necessity for     
moving  
toward higher and higher levels of abstraction... i don't have much     
in the way  
of antidote to this (at least in part because i'm, uhm, male) but i     
*do* believe    
that much of what might pass as irrelevant to some on this list in      
fact has    
a place in these proceedings... by way of example, i posted to this     
list    
some time ago a rather lengthy, perhaps pedantic response to apex of    
the m   
that tried to account for *who* i am vis-a-vis many of you... perhaps   
some of you find/found this     
aspect of exchange      
unnecessary (and i understand that i risk   
criticism here  
for attempting to privilege     
my own discursive       
orientation, but        
what the hell)...       
    
that is, we don't really know each other, many of us, and much of   
this    
discussion BECOMES agon-izing simply because we (incl. myself)      
haven't taken   
the time that perhaps we should to have developed and cultivated a      
sense of    
trust... i mean, i can stand the heat, so to speak, as i'm sure can     
many of     
you, but this is not a reason for coming together---here, there or      
anywhere... 
    
so i guess i'd have to opt for a more revealing, a closer encounter     
with each   
of you, however you each might wish to engender same...     
    
best,

joe, grownup logic has not improved on baby logic so far.       
    ------- 
    
I am sure you rmember that in order to prove anything logically we have to start
the null set (the nothing that IS!). Underlying ALL logic (baby & grownup) is th
which P is the null set.        
    
Since Parmenides thought that the null set was false (for him there is no 'nothi
is that any NOT entails an absence (which is a nothing) so Parmenides was   
just a tricky dude (a poet, you might say, who thought of the impossibility 
of change while changing his clothes, etc.) 
    
In theory he would not have been able to deny anything or assert anything. But  
he was just like any of us.

    PROVIDENCE (AHP) -- The Poetarium is unlike most museums    
you've visited.         
    It's located in a Providence working-class neighborhood     
with bridal shops, bakeries and bars on every block, about 10 miles     
from Brown University.      
    When you get there, you've got to climb a flight of stairs.     
    Suddenly, you realize you're in the middle of more than     
100,000 live poets, the kind that go ``buzz'' in the night.     
    Children, especially, love it.  
    More than 75,000 visitors -- mostly pre-teens -- file into the  
poetry zoo each year, paying $3 apiece to be up close and personal with     
the creepy, crawly inmates. Hundreds of school field trips have     
already been scheduled for 1999.

    ``It's not only entertaining, it's also educational     
and enlightening,'' says Steve Evans, the 30-year-old museum    
founder and proprietor of Steve's Bug-Off Poet Exterminating Co.,   
located on the building's ground floor. The Poetarium occupies      
6,500 square feet on the two top floors.    
    This is the real deal, no cheesy rip-off filled with    
first editions and photographs. Evans says it's the largest in the      
country.    
    ``The Smithsonian poetry exhibit in Washington has less     
square footage and I've got a million more poets still in storage,''    
says Evans, proudly displaying a room overflowing floor-to-ceiling      
with boxes, cookie tins and Tupperware filled with dead poets from      
around the globe.       
    ``I respect what they're doing. Their staff is extremely    
knowledgeable and they really do a great job teaching the kids,''   
said Robert Bertholf of the Poetry and Rare Book Room in Buffalo,   
which has its own extensive collection. ``Steve has even come in    
here and set up some wonderful exhibits, very professional stuff,''     
Bertholf said.

    The Poetarium is designed to give the illusion of being     
out in the wild. The walls are decorated in a bar motif, the    
carpets are cigarette-butt strewn and the soundtrack is poetry's    
own -- Amy Lowell chirping and Carl Sandburg humming. Movies,       
holograms, microscopes and professional quality exhibits and    
games keep people of all ages occupied.     
    There is also a real swarming beatnik read-in and a giant   
rubber-band ``enjambement'' for children to crawl through.      
    Electronic quizboards measure your poetry intelligence.     
    For example, did you know that New York School poets could      
survive on just the food offered at gallery openings? that Hip-Hop      
poets have more than 1,000 ``brothers'' and ``sisters'' each?       
    And yes, Language Poets really do bite, but maybe they're   
only angry about having a 12-month lifespan.    
    There's even a scale to weigh yourself in New Critics, New      
Formalists and other six-legged creatures. If you thought losing 10     
pounds was difficult, imagine shedding a half-million versifiers!

Tagore, Phyllis Webb, Pablo Neruda, Carl Dennis, bpNichol, Sappho,      
Jack Gilbert, Alan Gilbert, Allen Ginsberg and Gilbert Grape are    
all present.    
    ``Everyone here is really nice. It's not scary,'' said      
Jessica Lowenthal, 22. ``I had lots of fun.''   
    The centerpiece of the Poetarium is the pedants. Thousands      
and thousands of good old ``poeticus obscurorum'' -- stuffed shirts --  
encased inside a four-foot plastic fence that surrounds a model     
library and study. The repulsive critters slither in and out of the

    ``I promise you, they can't get out of there,'' says Evans's

``There's a Teflon paint strip at the top which makes them slide

    Numerous poetry-related items are available in the gift     
shop, including posters, T-shirts, coloring books, postcards and    
plastic Vincent Ferrinis.       
    Many of the poets are captured by Evans and his staff,

longtime poetry collector. Using butterfly nets and riding a    
mountain bike painted camouflage green and brown, Gizzi rolls       
into the wilds of nearby New York City and sees what he can     
snare.  
    For Evans, life's metamorphosis was a little more complex   
than word-larva-pupa-poet.      
    He began while a graduate student, working on the side as   
a lobbyist for poetic environmentalists. This led to opportunities      
in poetry population control. But he still prefers collecting to    
killing the poets, and in 1997 Evans opened the museum.     
    ``We used to have a smaller store, and we'd put whatever    
we caught each day in the front window -- short story writers,      
translators,'' Evans says. ``People were looking in the windows     
all the time. Teachers even brought their classes by. I thought     
this would be a great way to teach kids that poets aren't bad,      
once you get to know them.''    
    So what's next for Evans? Would you believe a poetrymobile?     
    ``I'm converting an old paddy wagon,'' he says. ``Look      
for us at a school or mall or senior center near you.''

  BUFFALO (AHP) - The struggling Buffalo Poetics        
 Program sent high profile scorer Susan Howe to the         
 Naropa Institute yesterday for veteran wingers Bobbie Louise       
 Hawkins and Anselm Hollo plus minor league defensewoman and recent     
 NEA recipient Eleni Sikelianos.    
  The Program, which has only one win in its last       
 five semesters, also sent a third-round pick in the 1999       
 admissions draft to the Institute as part of the deal.     
  Howe, who logged over a million miles last season to      
 lead the Program in travel time, had just two insights and three   
 inspired outbursts for five points in Buffalo's first 4 weeks      
 this year. 
  Hawkins and Hollo both played a significant role in       
 Naropa's last Holy Grail season, in 1993. In brief stints with the parent

Re Pressler's remark, I have just written a message with almost thesame     
concerns to Charles Bernstein about why I included a message to which I     
was responding in my response.      
    
For me the quickness and ease of response on the list is contrasted with    
the necessity to have a measured response. This is a hard place to get to   
when I have mostly either had easy and extended exchanges with      
corrections in conversation OR thought out slow exchanges by articles,  
letters, etc. I think it's the newness of the medium and the unusual    
nature of the way we must respond.      
    
Thanks Charlotte for your message.

Chris Stroffolino asks me to answer "being heard by whom" when I suggest    
that "to be heard you have to call yourself a theory." And yet, Chris, we   
both know that we both can barely afford a bus trip to NYC, although I  
have to admit that I did recently splurge and buy myself a new winter coat  
because the old one was starting to stink.  
    
Clearly, no one's being "heard" at all. But if I don't call myself a    
theory I know for a fact I'm out of work. On the other hand, perhaps    
there is a certain romantic charm in "living the free life of a roaver"     
and I'm just busy playing it up for ratings.

Dear Charles,   
    
Yes, Don Bryd's statement on the relationship of poetry to theory is too    
pat.  And so are some of Tom's and some of James' and others. And so are    
some of mine. I admit it. In being drawn into the discourse, I have been    
forced to formulate my position in a way that is not entirely satisfying    
to me.  No matter how I formulate it, it will not be entirely satisfying    
to me.  It is not just the formulations of others that I am dissatisfied    
with.  This is the paradox of my antitheoretical position.      
    
I do not want to create a "true theory" around my statements about art  
being on its own level. Art is separate and it is not. That is how I    
really feel. I have emphasized the former because I do not like the way     
the theorists assume or reason (or pontificate) from the latter. The    
problem with this is, it seems like I am only aware of the failure of   
theory, and that I have this unbounded, starry-eyed faith in the power  
of art. That is not the case.       
    
There is a sense in which art and theory are connected in their failure     
to fully impact people's lives. I tend to blame theory for its failure,     
but the people (both artist/poets and viewer/readers) for the failure of    
art. My lifelong experience has encouraged this distinction, but like any   
prejudice I know that it is not always accurate.        
    
To be continued...      
    
For now, I thank you for your question and thoughts.

Ah, drawn out of lurkdom by provocative questions.... tho I must admit,     
quite sheepishly, to be responding in *exactly* the spirit that Joe Tomato  
has described--I do so hate to be predictable...        
    
>Why do you lurk without posting?   
    
Well, I *don't* really lurk without posting.  A couple of weeks ago I wrote 
a fairly lengthy post describing *why* I feel--as a publisher and editor of 
two poetry series and miscellaneous individual volumes of poetry, *and* as a    
literary critic with "academic" credentials--like an outsider in the POETICS    
conversation.  My post met with resounding ... silence.  Didn't garner a    
single response on the list, though I did get backchannel notes from my old 
friend Joe (hi Joe!) and from Charles Bernstein (hi Charles!).  I've been   
active on the internet for a while, and I don't take nonresponse personally,    
but it *does* generally seem to conform to a pretty gendered (and   
racialized) pattern.  Since my concerns revolve primarily around issues of  
how race/gender/class interact with the theory and practice of "culture" and    
"art" (including poetry), whenever I post, I bring up these issues.     
Nonresponse is something I've certainly gotten used to. Now I tend to post  
only when I feel that I've got something pressing to say, and when I am met 
with nonresponse, I usually let the matter slide, *unless* "becoming    
visible" seems like a battle worth fighting in this particular place at this    
particular time.        
    
>What would it require to change this?  
    
Oh, it would be easy to get *me* to post more....  But it would require that    
someone(s) actually engage me in public conversation, offer a response to my    
words.  Think of the studies of male/female conversations which demonstrate 
that women introduce a wider variety of subjects than men, but that fewer of    
the subjects they introduce are picked up and expanded on.  And the ones    
which show that when a woman brings up an idea it's often ignored, *until* a    
man brings it up--at which point he gets the credit for thinking of it and  
she continues to be ignored.  These patterns are evident in email as well as    
in face-to-face conversations.  But email is even more difficult for a woman    
to negotiate, in my opinion, because the lack of physicality, the reduction 
to a textual "body," makes it harder for her to be SEEN/READ.       
    Look at it this way--email is one of the few environments in which  
anyone and everyone can "pass" as white, heterosexual, and male unless  
he/she speaks/writes out *against* that normative body.  Now, there are     
advantages to being able to "pass" in this manner (advantages that members  
of marginalized groups have always gained from passing), but there are also 
costs.  The advantages are clear for women--no sexual harrassment, no more  
being ignored, no more being marked as "other."  But the disadvantage is    
that passing requires adopting the language and interests and *style* of the    
folks you are passing *as,* and so concerns and questions and styles that   
might be significant to a woman *as a woman* become unspeakable.  On the    
other hand, in this environment in which everyone can "pass," it takes  
constant vigilance and a great deal of ingenuity to create and perpetuate a 
*nonwhite* *nonmale* and/or *nonheterosexual* textual body--difference must 
be inscribed in each post in a way that makes it visible to the reader.  The    
paradox is that "passing" allows women and nonwhite people to be "visible"  
in the sense that they are not treated as "other," but it is predicated on  
the disappearance of gender/racial identity.  On the other hand, refusing to    
"pass," and insisting on inscribing a nonwhite or nonmale identity in our   
email results, often, in our being "disappeared" in the manner in which     
women and nonwhite people are "normally" disappeared. The entrenchment of   
the normative construct in espace (which I tend to think of as The      
Unbearable Whiteness of Being) makes me feel a lot like Ellison's Invisible 
Man--I've *been* in flamewars in which I have textually kicked the shit out 
of people who simply COULD NOT SEE ME.  (And if you haven't reread the  
opening sequences of _Invisible Man_ it might be worth going back to, since 
it sums up *exactly* the phenomenon I am describing.)       
    
>Are there other venues (listserv discussion groups in particular) where    
>you are more active?       
    
I used to be very active on quite a few lists.  I'm the Typhoid Mary of     
flame wars--where I post frequently, they usually become epidemic.  In my   
Bad Old Days I could come out swinging against racist or sexist exclusion in    
discussions and rile folks up so bad that hitherto peaceful (read:      
"homogenous") espace communities would polarize and then shatter.  Grown men    
would act like children and storm off lists or publicly swear that they were    
never going to read another one of my posts.  Heck, I've pissed people off  
so badly over email that at least one has, in all seriousness, threatened my    
life.  (And yeah, those threats of violence--and implied rape--were     
gendered, too...)  But I don't do much of that sort of posting anymore.     
Mostly, I just needed to experiment with it for a while to figure out how it    
worked.  And I concluded, after some very serious thought and long study,   
that there was no way for me to *be* visible "here" in any of the ways which    
mattered to me.  So I now confine my occasional public espace forays to     
"raids across the border," with the intent of making the population nervous,    
while at the same time escaping without serious wounds. And I have *always* 
figured that the only way to create a "level playing field" is to build it  
yourownself, so I got together with some like-minded people and started     
SIXTIES-L, a moderated discussion list in my field of study.  I don't even  
post *there* that often, but it is definitely a woman-friendly space, as is 
demonstrated by the high percentage of women posting to it.  Which brings me    
to the next question:       
    
>If so, what do they do differently?    
    
Well, it seems to me that moderated spaces, or restricted-access spaces     
provide a more hospitable environment for women.  I've been on women's-only 
lists, and in those places women have no trouble posting at all.  As I said,    
on SIXTIES-L we moderate the discussion, and one of our rules is that we    
don't allow ad hominem attacks:  you can harsh on people's *arguments* or   
*texts* all you like, but you can't slam their characters.  This level of   
protection (applied equally to men and women) might have something to do    
with the higher percentage of women posting on our list.  The only      
unmoderated list I know of which supports an overwhelming percentage of     
female posters is WMST-L, the Women's Studies list for educators and    
academics.  WMST-L is technically unmoderated, but Joan Korenman is one of  
the most competent and active "nonmoderators" it's ever been my pleasure to 
observe in action. WMST-L might work so well precisely because it *is*
