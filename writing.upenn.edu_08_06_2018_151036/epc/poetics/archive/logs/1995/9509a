        I don't really mean communication in the sense of meaning or
conveying a message as much as I mean a point of contact.  It seems to
me that doing readings or circulating my works is a connection, it starts
a relationship.  There is a reception of something that was once
internal, a thought.  It still may be abstract and without function, but it
has touched someone else's life once it has left my fingers or my mouth.
If poetry was merely noise for myself I could just leave it in my head.
But I need the contact, the communion with someone else.  They don't have
to like it, or understand it, just read or hear it.  After that it's too
late to go back I've already invaded, they are no longer innocent of me.

It has just been brought to my attention that the Tasmanian Writers Union
meeting which was listed as taking place on Wednesday 4th September is
really taking place on Wednesday 4th October.
 
The corrected entry should read:
 
Wednesday 4th October there'll be a Tasmanian Writers' Union (TWU)
reading at the Bavarian Tavern 28 Liverpool Street Hobart at 7.30 pm.
featuring three of the readers from the Tasmanian Poetry Festival: Matt
Simpson (U.K.), Jenny Boult and Chris Mansell. Cost $8/$5 conc. Details
phone TWU (002) 240029.
 
 
Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused ( I hope nobody has to
change their travel plans).

Ok I did some research on limericks so I could get it right this time.
Anybody familiar with Edward Lear and the Book of Nonsense?
 
Here's a sample,
 
There once was an Old man of Marseilles
Whose daughters wore bottles green veils
The caught several fish, which they put in dish
And sent to their Pa in Marseilles.
 
there once was a Young Lady of Welling
Whose praise all the world was a telling
She played on the harp, and caught several carp,
The accomplished Young Lady of Welling.
 
Now would someone explian why you need fish to complete the verse?

Waterstone's Bookstore.  It didn't actually burst into flames (just being
dramatic), actually the restaurant below it, or beside it, did, and the
bookstore suffered tremendous water, smoke and structural damage.  A friend who
works there has heard that they will probably be closed for some months.

I'd bet that few of these same Americans have more than glanced at Jabes,
either. But you're otherwise right.

Subj:   Call for reviewers
 
Dear List Subscibers,
 
If you have already seen a version of the following, then please ignore
or forgive this notice, being sent now that all good academics are
back at their desks, ready for the fall term to get underway:
 
I am searching for people to review my forthcoming book: THE POETICS OF
AUTHORSHIP IN THE LATER MIDDLE AGES: THE EMERGENCE OF THE MODERN
LITERARY PERSONA (Peter Lang, due out this winter).  The book discusses
what I call the authorship trope and its deepest implications within
the world of literature but also within the sphere of what the history
of ideas.  The book places literary "signing" within its wider milieux;
I have things to say about Augustine, Anselm, Abelard, Aquinas and Ockham among
others.  The book contains extensive close readings of Guillem IX, Marcabru,
Dante, Langland and Chaucer.
 
The book's argument is that literary individualism first widely manifests in
the early twelfth-century as word puzzles and overt self-naming, but also more
broadly and deeply in discussions about the nature of writing and the role
of the poet in the world.  These five poets are typical of their era: they are
poets, AND they are intellectuals.  My study traces their literary claims
of authorship to their interests in contemporaneous philosophical debtates--not
to the need for what modernity views as self-promotion.  Nevertheless, in their
creations of both history and fiction, these poets anticipated modern narrative
and its literary persona, as they contributed to the emergence of the modern,
autonomous self.
 
 
If you would like more information about this book, for the purposes of reviewing it or otherwise, please contact me.

I'm curous if any of you out here know of any or many
poems related to or influenced by children's literature.
I'm not talking about children's verse either.  I think
bp did something (I know he had a lot of pop up books and,
if I remember correctly, he worked on the Fraggle Rock genius);
Dennis Lee might be another.  In particular, I'm interested
in the influence of fairy tales on contemporary poetry
and poetics.
 
ONe of the things I've been thinking about is how the supernatural
occurs.  In many tales, the supernatural offers an occasion to
a character to demonstrate (hence, "monster") their unrecognized virtue
(Hansel and Gretel and the Witch, for instance--she allows them to
prove to their stupid parents that they're pretty good kids after
all).  In this respect, the supernatural functions like a language,
or the acquistion of a language which is recognized by the ruling
community or persons (H and G TELL their parents over and over that
they don't want to go, that they want to stay, etc...but it takes
their actions against the witch before anyone listens).  Monsters
as demonstrative language? Speech as supernatural, an initiation into
a discursive community?
 
Kids get all the hard stuff to read.
 
Anyways, with this in mind, I would like to know of any poems or
poets that deal with fairy tale lore in, not necessrily this manner,
but work with the material.
 
Thanksillions,
 
Ryan Knighton
 
PS I have a really crappy joke I want to tell but it doesn't work

Not guilty.
 
I compared you to Ross Perot.
 
Fliply and with no elucidation.
 
But if anybody asked (and Kevin Killian did), I would have said that
what I meant was that, like Ross' use of aphorisms, the stance behind
"All Acts are Simply Acts" and especially the intro on poetry &
politics seems like common sense on the surface but is actually very
willfully (to the point of being coy) wrong.
 
It carries Williams' dictum about no ideas but in things to an extreme,
which could be pure thingness but also simply "no ideas"
 
But since you've declared WCW to be "boring" that must not be it either
 
All best,
Ron

hmmmmm...stevie smith's "our bog is dood" popped into my head, but probably
doesn't fit with what you're looking for.  I read a poem called

The movie was actually quite well-done, only none of the "actors" could act.
The kids were great.  The Tibetan Buddhist monks who played Tibetan Buddhist
monks were also great.  Bridget Fonda did well, but didn't have a very big
role.  Which pretty much leaves Keanu and Chris Isaak.  I kept expecting the
Buddha's enlightenment to be expressed like, "Whoaaaa, dude!"  It was a
little distracting.

Ryan,
 
Card catalogue here has _Disenchantments: an Anthology of Modern
Fairy Tale Poetry,_ ed. Wolfgang Mieder, University Press of
New England 1985.  Don't know if it contains any interesting work.
 
From _My Book House_ (1920)--worth it for the last two lines:
 
THE ASSEMBLING OF THE FAYS
 
They come from beds of lichen green,
They creep from the mullein's velvet screen;
   Some on the backs of beetles fly
From the silver tops of moon-touched trees,
Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high,
And rocked about in the evening breeze;
And now they throng the moonlight glade,
Above--below--on every side,
Their little minim forms arrayed,
In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride.
 
-- Rachel

That would've been okay. I liked the film quite a bit (having all the

As a new subscriber (introduced by friends Pierre Joris and Rod Smith), I
came late to this thread, but have never understood why Jabes has not
been read more widely here.  Toward that end, I'm teaching an over-
subscribed seminar this semester on -The Book of Questions-, and,
fortuitously, Rosmarie Waldrop will join us one week for discussion.
Does anyone have ideas about why Americans have so ignored or resisted
Jabes?
 
Thank you all creating a list of such intelligence. . .

I am pleased to announce that shortly before midnight last night the
move to the new Electronic Poetry Center url was made operative.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The EPC's new URL is:
 
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Please re-set your bookmarks!
 
Also, keep in mind that for the next couple of days I will continue to
debug the new URL. A number of changes had to be made to accommodate
new features and quicker links, so it took significant rebuilding of
the files to accomplish this. You will find occasional link failures
but this is being worked on assiduously. (The author libraries, for
example, are still being rebuilt but I hope to complete these very
soon.)
 
Thanks for your patience and I look forward to seeing you at our new
url!

To the contrary, one of my complains in recent years is that Jabes is
about the only contemporary French "poet" (what do we call that kind of
work?) known to many academics outside of French departments -- I assume
that somebdoy is purchasing all those copies of his works that are sold
at university book stores (& now even Borders!) --
 
thanks again to Rosmarie Waldrop and Wesleyan for making those beautiful
English translations available
 
But wouldn't it be nice if Jacques Roubaud or Anne-Marie Albiach were as
widely known?

I've yet to encounter an academic (outside French) who has read
Jabes, and I urge whatever so-called "mainstream" poets I encounter
to read him.  My students know Roubaud and Albiach.  It's sad that
there are several excellent Roubaud translations circulating without
a publisher.

        One of the reasons -- I think -- that Jabes' name is better
known than his work might have to do with the fact that many young
students/poets meet up with _the name_ Jabes in the writings of
Derrida, Blanchot & others, rather than pulling a book off the shelves
in the poetry section of a bookstore.
        Beyond that there may also be the question of a range of
people used to certain american poetries might find the work too
fordidding in its "esoteric" (Jewish/cabbalistic etc.) & "spiritual"
dimensions. It is work of a piece & it does take some energy & desire
to move towards it.
        As to some of the other recations to your query: Sure, it
would be excellent if Roubaud & Albiach were better known -- but they
are known -- or they wouldn't be mentioned here! I could rattle off a
dozen names (not published by P.O.L.)  whose work is as worthwhile &
_should_ be known (not even "better" -- just known) in this country.

Aldon, Carolyn, Herb and all others,
 
Why have americans so ignored or resisted Jabes?  Because it is a
poetry of ideas and it's structurally innovative.  Each of these
traits alone is enough to unnerve most U.S. readers.  Why was
Zukofsky ignored and resisted for so long?  As Aldon pointed out,
contemporary american poets who are similarly intriguing and
challenging are equally ignored.  I think U.S. readers are
taught that if a work makes demands on them it's seriously
flawed because the poet should have made it more user-friendly.

Aldon,
 
Yes it would be nice if Jacques Roubaud or Anne-Albiach were as well
known as Jabes.  Emmanuel Hocquard, as well.  I highly recommend
Michael Palmer's translation of Hocquard's TABLE OF THEORIES.  For
that matter, I highly recommend Tom Mandel's LETTERS OF THE LAW
which seems to have been ignored when it came out in January except
by those who didn't like it because it's unlike some earlier work.
 
Still Jabes is hardly a household word, though Roubaud, Anne-Marie
Albiach and Hocquard seem to be unknown ever within French Depts.

Carolyn,
 
I delighted that your students are familiar with Roubaud and Albiach.
I'd be interested in hearing more, back channel, about the unpublished
Roubaud translations.  Frankly, the only people I know who have
actually read Albiach or Jabes have been other poets.  I've yet to
encounter an academic familiar with their work. Roubaud seems more
widely but as a writer of fiction instead of poetry.  Glad you're
doing a seminar on BOOK OF QUESTIONS.  All of these writers deserve
a broader readership here in the states.

I am surprised to hear all the talk of Jabes's lack of readers. I was
led to believe that everyone but I has read him. I have some of gis
books, but I have not read much. But now everyone but I has read
Bhabba or however you spell his name.

The piece of mine called "XCII (cinder-cifter)" in _oblek 12_
uses a 1932 edition of Mother Goose for half of it's vocabulary.
The form is Pound's Canto of same #. & the other half of the vocabulary comes
from a character by character transliteration of the _Tao Te Ching_. Lines
flush left source Goose, lines indented source Tao. Also, I've done a writing
through _Fun with Dick & Jane_ called "See it Go," which is part of a
"circus" based on Cage's _Roaratorio_, uses broken toy sound effects among
other things. A favorite of mine is David Shapiro's "The Boss Poem" written
with his son Daniel.

Good question.
 
I can think of two reasons, at least. One is that Americans as an
audience (this is the grossest overgeneralization, I realize) have
tended to love a poetics of the noun (Whitman, Williams, Olson,
Creeley, Ginsberg, Crane, O'Hara, etc.). The counter examples that do
exist (Stevens, Ashbery, Duncan and Eliot come to mind) all produced a
metaphysical discourse, but one that seemed (important qualifier there)
to shy away from a spiritual discourse. Duncan's spirituality was so
19th century as to be a museum of itself. Eliot's catholicism came
after he had made his inroad on the public mind.
 
A second is that the French prose poem as it has come to America via
its main proselytizers, Bly, Benedikt, Edson, et al, veers away from
longer works and works that really transcend the "prose lyric" posed by
Jacob as a closed form. Thus Segalen, St. John Perse, the Ponge of the
pine woods have all been marginalized.
 
A third is that he's Jewish. One look at the fate of the Objectivists
ought to tell us what that means in America.
 
All best,

verse and contemporary poets/ry/ics?  Any thoughts on language as
"the supernatural"?

I have generally quoted a lot of Jabes's comments on "the book" in talks
I've given over the last four years or so on the book arts. People in that
field as well as more "poetics"-involved groups I've spoken to about
such matters seem surprised that I would make a more or less direct
connection between such theoretical/spiritual discussion of the book and
the book as physical object. Such a connection seemed immediate to me on
reading Jabes's work. It still does. The book arts community is certainly
not familiar with Jabes, although I've loaned my books to many people in
the field, and he is taken up with some enthusiasm among those who attempt
to construct a conceptual framework for their activities in bookmaking. Now
if I could get them to read Albiach and Roubaud and Hocquard and Fourcade
and Royet-Journoud, there might be some fascinating trans-Atlantic book
projects.

I actually knew a woman at Sonoma State when I was there who was a Millay
expert.  She had been accepted to Vancouver to do a doctorate last time I
heard from her but wasn't sure whether to go.  Her name is Jennifer,
damn, can't remember her last name.  I'll look and see if I can find it.
She did wonderful readings of Millay in which she dressed up and

Actually, Ryan, when I mentioned Atwood I was also thinking of her
verse. She has always declared fairy tales her main source, and as
you might know, she did her harvard thjesis on late 19th C horror
writers like Rider haggard. She was also a sucker for Hollywood
monster movies. Check thru her poetry: you will find lots of traces
from fairy tales.
 
You might have a look at Kenward Elmslie, too. See how fairy tales
mesh with Jean harlow and the Old Dutch lady, etc.

                **EXPLOITATION AND CENSORSHIP!**
 
                                   September 1, 1995
 
To the Editor:
 
Within the last two weeks, it has come to our attention that Media Play,
Inc. and its parent company Musicland Corporation, are censoring the works
of American poets and writers by refusing to carry them in their stores
even on consignment, based on the supposed "sensitivity" of the material.
Works refused by the Media Play store in Saginaw, Michigan, include two
which were recognized in part or whole as meritorious in mainstream
national literary competitions.  The store management declares that in
doing this, they are following corporate policy dictated by the national
corporate headquarters and its Board.
 
According to the Detroit Free Press, it is national Media Play corporate
policy to target areas with highly-educated populations for their new
stores, because people who are highly educated read books.  People who
read books also buy CD's, videotapes, computer software and collectibles
which the stores carry.  In order to bring these people into the store for
extended periods of time, all Media Play stores have been directed by
their corporate headquarters to solicit writers, poets, artists and
musicians from the immediate area to participate in public relations
events such as performances, readings, book signings and exhibits.  Such
people are also likely to become good customers.
 
However, the Saginaw store that was willing to host a writer for a reading
is not willing to sell that same writer's books on the shelves even on
consignment, based on the store management's and the corporate public
relations staff's fears that the content might be found offensive.  In
addition, the Saginaw store has pulled items from the shelves sent to them
by the corporate buyers, without ever receiving a complaint, thereby
making themselves moral arbiters for adult readers in the tri-county
region, the same "highly-educated readers" they wish to attract.
 
We the undersigned will not spend money in any Media Play store until this
policy has been changed, nor will we cooperate with their public relations
efforts.  We urge all those who value freedom of expression to boycott all
stores run by Media Play or Musicland Corporation, their parent company.
Please let store managers know that you are boycotting them, and why you
are doing so.  Please decline invitations to give readings, concerts, art
exhibits, book signings, or in other ways contribute to the public
relations efforts of Media Play, Inc., or their parent company Musicland
Corporation.  We also encourage small press publishers to test the
situation at their local Media Play outlets by bringing in publications
for possible consignment.

Okay. Here I go a-rattling off in the random order of alpabetic
precedence a baker's dozen French poets:  Jean-Christophe Bailly,
Matthieu Benezet,Yves Buin,  Michel Bulteau, Michel Deguy, Jacques
Dupin, Jean-Pierre Duprey, Genevieve Clancy, Gerard de Cortanze,
Jean-Pierre Faye, Liliane Giraudon, Leslie Kaplan, Matthieu Messagier,
Alain Jouffroy, Bernard Noel, Michel Maire, Claude Pelieu,  Denis
Roche, Maurice Roche, James Sacre, Eric Sarner, Serge Sautreau, Frank
Venaille, Marcelin Pleynet,  Jacqueline Risset, Alain Veinstein, Andre
Velter, Jean-Pierre Verheggen,
 
hmm, I think I got more than a dozen already, so let me now switch to
a quick list of poets who write in French but are from south of "la
metropole" as they used to say: Mohammed Dib, Tahar Djaout, Mohammed
Khair-Eddine, Abdelwaheb Meddeb, Abdelkebir Khatibi, Ahmed Kedidi,
Amina Said,Habib Tengour, Kateb Yacine...

Dear Pierre,
        To your wonderful list I would add Jean-Jacques Viton and
Joseph Guglielmi.  Are the poets from "south of the metropole"
available in translation?  For a sampling of the others, I can
only suggested Serge Garonsky's already well known -Toward a New Poetics-
(University of California Press, 1994).

Subject:      Re: Jabes
 
Since Pierre and I have been mulling over the names & works of many in our
attempt to compose a global anthology, etc., shouldn't we mention his own
recent attempts to translate the very powerful Congolese poet Tchicaya
U Tam'si (died in 1988) who was also a master of the French language & its
poetries?  I think -- in terms of what we're planning to include in the
second installment of our work -- mention should also be made of poets like
Bernard Heidieck and Henri Chopin, who have been part of the most experimental
side of French poetry, along with others like Michele Metail, Pierre & Ilse
Garnier (Spatialism), Isidore Isou (Lettrisme), Julien Blaine, & so on.  The
question of what it takes to be known & read over here is itself a little
puzzling.  Jabes (who was a good friend to many of us) has a huge number of
translated works, but Roubaud (besides the fiction work) has at least two
recent (important/crucial) books of poetry -- translated (like Jabes's
works) by Rosmarie Waldrop.  Both of them -- but Jabes in particular -- are,
it seems to me, as well known as one would expect contemporary furrin poets
to be in the present U.S. climate.  But it might also be noted -- with Jabes,
say -- that there is both a reader enthusiasm & a suprising or not-so
surprising reader resistance.  I think this may have, as Silliman suggests,
some bias about the Jewish nature of the work, but more often (in my
experience of it) takes the form of people professing to feel outside his
concerns, which are taken to be much more hermetic (referential to some
presumed deep learning in kabbala & Jewish mysticism etc) than they actually
are.  But the point is that there are a considerable number of people who
may block on Jabes but who are otherwise quite aware of who he is & may
have even tried to crack him, so to speak.  (I take much of this as a measure,
by the way, of how really good he is.)
 
Aside to Ron on the non-acceptance of the Objectivists for being Jewish, it
seems to me that a probably more widespread block was that they were closely
tied to Pound (as anti-Jew), even so far (in the early days) as to include
him (& WCW) within the body of what was being presented in the Objectivists
Athology & the Objectivists issue of Poetry/Chicago.  I mean only that on
that level, things in the poetry world (& elsewhere) get pretty damn confusing.
 
And going back to the original matter of known and unknown French poets, one
should remember that a number of those mentioned by Pierre appear also in
Paul Auster's Random House Book of Twentieth-Century French Poetry -- in
addition to those in the Gavronsky book that Carolyn refers to.
 
Okay & greetings.

Check Duncan on "faerie" etc. for the real mccoy on these matters.  Or Yeats,
say, once you get past those celtic twilights.  Or Lorca whose duende (goblin)
is of that world as well.  Or our old friend Wakoski come to think of it.
 
        viz, in the case of Duncan
 
                                        a fairy citadel
                        a fabulous construction out of
                            Christianity where Morgan le Fay
                        carries the king to her enchanted Isle
                             (R.D., "Nel Mezzo del Cammin ...")
 
& with others a still darker, older world -- one of those resources now left
for children.
 
But that much is an old old story -- part of our poetics (to say nothing of
our poetry) since Shakespeare & Spenser at the very least.  And old, old in
this century as well.

Will anyone who knows anything about anything mentioned in the
note below (sent to Ric Caddel in the UK) please write--soon--
(Cristina_Brown@Brownvm.brown.edu) & tell me how I might best
proceed?  Feel free to say insulting things about my project as
it now stands (for instance: "uninspired" "rudimentary" "poorly-
researched" "boring" "what project?") but be sure also to offer useful
advice--names/addresses of contacts, possible angles to take, etc.  I
don't think I'll be doing work on the "relationship between
contemporary British & American poetries" per se but will use that
connection as a jumping-off point to some more specific (& less
reductive) study . . . .
 
Mr. Caddel:
 
I'm a writing student at Brown University, recently subscribed to the
POETICS list--have been working with the (Burning Deck) Waldrops
and friends on a proposal which if successful will convince the British
Fulbright & Marshall committees to have me sent over to some British
university to work on a project having to do with the relationship (?)
between contemporary British & American poetries, and which would involve
quite a bit of research on the poets featured in Longville & Crozier's A
Various Art, Mottram et al.'s The New British Poetry, Tom Raworth's
Exact Change showcase & others writing in a similar (British) vein. As
far as I can tell, there hasn't been a whole lot written on the kind of
British poetry which interests me--poetry which reflects a disaffection
for received modes of reading & writing, which does not seek primarily
to appease or to comfort--into which, in fact, is built a certain
resistance--& in which a considered and difficult relationship to (& with)
language is manifest. So far I've looked at the Hampson/Barry
collection (scope of the possible), a book of essays by A. Weatherhead,
an article by Marjorie Perloff, & very little else--not being able to find
out more (A Various Art not locally available, for instance--I came
across it in a London bookstore last summer) makes it seem all the
more important that I go to England--I've been told that Anthony
Crozier is at Sussex & John James at Cambridge, though I haven't been
able to find James' name on the Cambridge faculty lists & haven:t been
able to locate e-mail addresses for either--or in fact anyone else who
might be able to help me save yourself.  The proposal's due September
22nd--can you give me some leads, suggest a university at which a
project like mine might be welcome--or pass this note on to someone
who might be interested or willing to offer advice?  I'll post some
version of this on the list.
 
Thanks,
Cristina_Brown@brownvm.brown.edu

irrelevant, perhaps, but somehow seques with a joke that an alto player
made last night at the Detroit Jazz Festival: after the next tune, be
ready for a discussion of Marx in English.  I beg indulgence.
 
Is "duende" commonly translated as "goblin"?
As Chris Cheek reminded the list some while ago, the first English translation
of the Manifesto begins, "There is a hobgoblin"/not "A spectre haunts. . ."
 
What is the difference between goblin and hobgoblin?
J. Edgar's spectre might ask 'Who would you trust your children to,
Lorca's "duende" or Marx's "hobgoblin"?'--his grammar would be as bad.
He would see connections, even connecting under the bed.
 
But I do want to know about duende, especially in light of a nice
piece of Nathaniel Mackey's on Miles Davis's "Sketches of Spain" alongside
Lorca on duende.  Makes me laugh, at least, a happy laugh of trebled
hauntings--at least.

This is the first time I have, I think, seen duende translated as
goblin. That is a little alarming, given that a popular brand of
toilet paper in mexico is Duende.
 
Have you seen the transcribed discussion among Olson, Duncan and
Ginsberg about duende during the 1963 Vancouver poetryfest. It has
been publisht a few times, most recently in Ralph Maud's Olson
Newsletter. In the discussion, curiously enough, Olson and esp.
Duncan are way off, and Ginsberg comes closest to it. He mentions, I
think I recall, Mexicans telling him the duende is what scares the
cattle at night.
 
There is also a discussion of duende in the third Spicer lecture
(1965) which will be published in Peter Gizzi's edition.
 
By the way, the toilet paper is called that not because going No. 2
is spooky in Mexico, but because a literal meaning is also "soft."

I am thinking that your best help might come from Peter Quartermain,
who is on this list, but usually lurks. He is an expert on the hipper
Brit poets, as well as being hip to what is happening in the U.S. He
goes to England often. One of the best places to work might be at U.
of Durham, where the Bunting papers are, and smart folks.
The crossover started with the UK littlelittle mags of the 60s , such

   New York state.  While the symposium will take place during four
   weekends over the 1995-96 academic year, the discussion list will be
   a continual forum to discuss issues relevant to the relation between
   communication, especially written language, and technology.
 
   TEXT21-L is intended to discuss not only the future of text, but also
   the way new technology integrates other media, like sound, video,
   images, and virtual reality, into text, and the emerging forms of
   communication made possible by new technology.
 
   The relative benefits and problems of "new media" compared to "old
   media," technology and rhetoric, the future of the written word,
   Computer Mediated Communication, Human-Computer Interaction, the fate
   of the book, the relations between text and image, the future of
   communication, the philosophical implications of technology, and
   copyright issues are all relevant issues.  The tone of the list is
   intended to strike a balance between scholarly and conversational,
   but the ultimate structure of the list will be decided by the
   individual decisions of its members.
 
   All entries to this list will be edited, hypertextually linked, and

a note on duende
it has the following meanings in Spanish in general as a noun (i wasn't
aware that it is an adjective meaning soft in Mexican Spanish)
 
1. goblin
2. charm, enchantment, bewitchment
 
[duende comes originally from duen de casa (shortened from duen~o de
casa = `owner of the house,' in reference to a spirit that haunts a house.]
 
Lorca certainly did not mean 1 but rather a non-anthropomorphizable
`presence'.
 
I wonder if the toilet paper was named by someone who knew about Charmin'.

This is for Christina Brown.  I don't think the poetries you describe are
studied anywhere academically in the UK but your best bet would be Sussex
with Peter Nicholls.  A wonderful guy with a great interest in all the
poetries you describe, books on Modernisms and Ezra Pound and now working
on a poetry book.  At Edinburgh there's Aidan Day who shares your
interests and maybe you could study at Cambridge with Jeremy Prynne but
that might be iffy for the Marshall, etc.
 
Anyway, I'd put down Sussex and there are many other good people there at
the School of American Studies.
Hope it works.
Best, Marjorie Perloff

Pierre -- don't toy with us -- give us those names -- especially those
available anywhere in English -- (The only other language I can read so
far is Spanish) --
 
My view of things may admittedly be skewed -- Jabes appears to sell _and_
get read around the Bay Area -- at least since the handsome republication
of _Book of Questions_ a while back --  Certainly better known here than
the others I named --
 
but give us those names -- the best thing I get from this list is reading

Hey, Marjorie.
 
Things must have changed for the better at Sussex. In 1966 I went
there and asked whether, holding a scholarship, I could work on Basil
Bunting. The English dept. told me heavens, no, because Bunting was
still alive.

By golly, my U. of Chicago dictionary gives "goblin" for duende.
In discussing the word in 1965, a Mexicano told me it meant
soft/smooth as well as the spectral stuff, in everyday talk, as an
adjective.
 
Maybe the Mexicano was a fantasma, maybe the same one that whispered
dondamente to Spicer.

I too go to England often, tho it's getting hard to find. I've
back-channelled to Cristina Brown with specific suggestions, but thought
it useful to come back on some points. First, a little story: When I first
arrived in Newcastle in the late '60s I showed my adolescent scribbles to
someone who said I'd obviously been reading Dorn and Duncan, who I'd never
heard of (indeed, I hadn't heard of anyone). I trotted round to Tom
Pickard's shop Ultima Thule (which I used as a library) and began to read
Dorn and Duncan, and was flattered but mystified by the comparison (still
am).
 
The first point is that "the message" was firmly in place by that stage,
and that objectivist and black mountain and new york poetries were
getting through - at least to that place. I later discovered that John
Seed was also grazing those shelves at the same time - we probably rubbed
shoulders by the little magazines shelves. Those little mags, including
Tlaloc, as George said, did a good job: I'd mention Grosseteste Review,
Second Aeon, and Ian Hamilton Finlay's Poor.Old.Tired.Horse. (aka POTH)
at the same time. Also, there was "the Migrant set" - Gael Turnbull,
Michael Shayer and Roy Fisher - invaluable cross-fertilizers right at the
start of the 60s.
 
The second point is that not all assumptions about transatlantic
"influences" are well-founded, and indeed in their reductive form they can
be unhelpful (a UK "establishment" put-down of Pig Press which still
surfaces is "publishes American and American-influenced poets" - as if
american influence were some kind of virus!): what's more helpful, I'd
have thought, wd be to identifiy the affinities - and even the differences
- between some of the groups Cristina mentions and their American and
European counterparts.
 
Then there's Bruce Andrews, for example, writing in FLOATING CAPITAL (an
anthology of UK poets from Potes&Poets): "resources made available in part
from innovative American poetries (& poetics) of the 1970s & 80s have
(arguably) helped spur [these poets]". The distances between writers are
vast enough, it seems to me, without bringing country-of-origin
legislation into it.

Will try to answer a few messages in one shot on this Labor day (get
it back to the first of May!) morning --
 
First a sad announcement: About ten days ago the Swiss-Italian poet
Franco Beltrametti died suddenly. He was one of our last great
peripatetic travelling companeros, at home as much in Kalifornia or
here on the East Coast than in Japan, Holland, France or Italy. & one
of the gentlest sould it has been my privilege to know. Here a little
poem from his book _Target_.

        Good that Jerry filled the experiemntal/concrete/soungpoetry
gaps in my quick list of frog poets. One could add Julien Blaine & the
work of his Marseille group & magazine DOC(K)S (a scene on which,
incidentally, Franco had been very active these last years). There are
any number of other figures to add to my list: Claude Miniere, Valere
Novarina, Guy Darol for example, but also such towering experiemtal
prose figures as Pierre Guyotat (the last French writer, to my knowledge to
have one of his Gallimard-published works censored by the French
Government!). The list is endless...
 
        Besides the anthologies already mentioned on the list, here
are two other books worth investigating as they have some of the
younger writers not in the other one:
 
        _French Poets of Today_ published in 1987 by Guernica Editions
(Montreal then, now based in Toronto) I don't know if the book is
still in print, but worth trying to pick up.
 
        The spring '87 (Vol 30. n. 3) issue of "The Literary Review"
pubvlished by Fairleigh Dickinson Universioty. This issue is subtitled
"New French Writing" & includes some experiemntal prose by Guyotat &
Sollers (from the latter's _Paradiso_) (my translations) as well as
the usual suspects (Albiach, Hocquard, Jabes, Roet-Journoud) plus a
short bit by one of my favorite French (prose)witers, Pascal Quignard.
        Importantly, the issue contains a secoind section edited by
Eric Sellin, called "Francophone Literature of the Maghreb" presenting
writers such as Dib, Alloula, Amrouche, Sebti, Said, Boujedra, Mimouni
& others. Sellin edits (edited?) a magazine called _The Celfan Review_
essentially on Maghrebian writers from temple University where he teaches.
Otherwise Maghrebian literature is unknown & untranslated here.
        I'll pass along more information as I come across it.

        It would be worthwhile getting in touch with both Shamoon
Zamir & Clive Bush at Kings College, University of London, The strand,
London WC2R 3LS. They are both ex-students of Eric Mottram who was the
most important figure inb the rapporchement between US & Brit poetry.
(Thge Cambridge group to some large extent folded back upon itself,
classical Brit invagination, even though Prynne now writes poems in
Chinese). John James teaches at the Polytechnic in Cambriudge, which
is why you couldn't find him in the U directories. If you want/need

A point about "duende" being something like "goblin" is that Lorca, like
many others, was drawing from & (as the situationist might have said)
retourning (retuning?) an expression taken to have deep (if later
bowdlerized) meanings within the culture.  There's a touch of evil in
them goblins -- dangerousness or wildness -- that must have been part of
its appeal (to see that beneath the Disney-duendes of a later generation).
So, I thought too that Duncan, with his fairy/faerie differentiation,
was involved in a similar project -- getting some of that fiery/fury sense
back into the word (& touching on the lore behind the word, if that's
still reachable).  I used to think -- in our old ethnopoetics days -- that
that was what we were largely into.  And I think I still do.
 
All best,

ps. "Duende" (i.e. GOBLIN) as the name of a toilet paper is probably not so
striking -- except for those of us who get our duendes strictly out of
Lorca.  (Like Katharsis as a going term for (dry)cleaners, I'm told, in
modern Greece.)

Ashbery's "The Poems" has the music of children's books, and "Europe" used a
sort of childish aviator book for much of its text... Kenneth Koch's "The
Circus" part one is one of a few of his experiments in children's book
narrative, and parts of his novel _The Red Robins_ borrow heavily from all
kinds of children's books--he even had Random House print it on rough paper
in an odd format to approximate the feel of a boy's book. Ron Padgett's
"Falling in Love in Spain or Mexico" takes all its phrases from a child's
spanish text/phrase book. And aside from D. Shapiro's "the boss poem" that
Rod mentioned, there are poems using (transforming) children's pedagogical
texts in Lateness, To an Idea and House (I think). Randall Jarrell's _The
Animal Family_ has been illustrated nicely by Maurice Sendak, and Ruth Krauss
did many books on the hazy border between NYschool and kidlit, my favorite
was and is _A Hole Is To Dig_, consisting of excellent juvenile
aristotelianism.

Speaking of Michel De Guy.... He visited recently at LSU, oddly. He was very
open to grad students and junior faculty. Gave a reading and even met with
students at a nearby coffee shop. Which is more than most visting writers
consent to doing. Certainly none of his ability and importance.
 
And yet only five students arrived at Highland to meet with him. Of those,
perhaps three spoke French. Two faculty also attended. It was embarrasing and
awkward, but perhaps is some indication of how French poetry in general is
accepted in the "official" academy (I of course do not speak of the academics
on this list). Jabes perhaps has some cred simply because he is spoken of
in Derrida.

Doesn't Lorca have a chilling essay describing duende as the driving

Ooops.  See that the first mention of duende was re Lorca.  I didn't
know duende meant a kind of hobgoblin.  Why I was chilled by the way he
wrote about duende was that it sounded as though he allied the Spanish
poet with a kind of macho obsession with death.  Maybe he was right but

Yes indeed Eric -- the poetry out in one collected volume (Gallimard)
& a lovely collection of essays on poetry _L'Intention Poetique_
(Seuil) both of which -- in toto or in parte -- could use translation.

It's interesting that a lot of the poems referred to me have been
suggested for their verse form, as opposed to direct reference to
Fairy Tales or their plots.  Dorn's _Gunslinger_ could be added, I suppose,
for its Seussian lines.
 
Jordan:
 
You mentioned a book, I think, abt NYSchool and its relationship
to kids verse.  What isthe stuff on that?  It sounds perfect.
 
Thanks all,

This may be jumping the gun a bit, but it seems that I've
been elected to get the ball rolling.
 
Some of us G2ers here in Vancouver are planning a new publication entitled
TADS.  George Stanley has offered to be an advisory editor (and will
be submitting some material from his new book) and GB might lend
a hand if I buy him breakfast.  I will be involved along with Reg
Johanson (also on this list) and Thea Bowering.
 
Anyone interested in submitting poetry for the first issue is
welcome.  The more the merrier and it would be nice to have some
connection to the world beyond the Fraser Valley.
 
Please forward schtuff to either Ryan Knighton or Reg Johanson
        c/o Dept. of English
        Simon Fraser University
        Burnaby,B.C.

We're not set up to handle electronic submissions, so sorry.
If you have any questions you can backchannel me at knighton@sfu.ca .
And no this project is not associated with the University. I just
have less mail problems there.

I'd like to mention another source for contemporary French writing in
translation: issues three and four of AVEC magazine.  Issue three has
work by Royet-Journoud, Albiach, Lewinter, Dahan, Guglielmi, Bessette,
Fardoulis-Lagrange, Leris, Du Bouchet, Davie, Colobert, Fourcade (--a
minefield of names, sorry for any typos).  Issue four has work by Cadiot,
Hocquard, Couturier, Risset, Cohen, Alferi, Fremon.  They're available
from AVEC, PO Box 1059, Penngrove, CA 94951. They're $7.50 a piece.
 
Also, I've been passing on the posts about French writing to Cydney
Chadwick, AVEC's editor, and she writes:
 
>I don't know if you want to post this on the poetics list but Madame
Renee
at the bookstore Le Divan in Paris is happy to ship books to the states
and open an account for interested readers. All you have to give her is a
credit card # (and of course you get the best exchange rate using a
card).If you want more information, i'll give you the street address and
tel.of Le Divan."

I can post the address if anyone is interested.
 
Finally, might as well put a plug in for AVEC's web page:
http://www.crl.com/~creiner/syntax/avec.html
 
I was really happy to see this thread on French writing (and thanks to
Carolyn F. for starting it, and to Pierre and others for the names).
Now, how about contemporary Russian writing...

I have visited this page and would like to exclaim - it's terrific! A
very good job you did, Chris. It includes samples of writing and a lot
of great stuff. It's worth a visit! I even linked to it in three
places at the EPC: presses, mags, and what's new.

First place I read Lorca's duende essay was in the introduction to
the Penguin Book of Garcia Lorca's poetry. It was a big item among
the young poets in Vancouver ca. 1960.

Like Franco Beltrametti, a wonderful witty gentle person who died much
too soon.
 
The best one volume intro to contemporary Russian poetry that I know of
is Third Wave, edited by Kent Johnson (who may or may not be the
trickster behind the fictive Araki Yasusada) and Stephen Avery, with by
Alexei Parshchikov and Andrew Wachtel (U Michigan, 1992), which grew
out of Kent and Stephen's participation in the 1989 Leningrad
conference.
 
All these poets seem bedeviled by the relationship of writing to
nationhood. Beltrametti, whom I only met twice (once at Canessa Park in
SF and once in the south of France), was I believe from Belgium or
Switzerland and had a knack for European languages akin to Pierre or
Anselm Hollo's. If his work isn't well known in the west, it's
precisely because of that ambiguity of place.
 
The Russian literary scene seems to have been exploded with the end of
the Soviet state. Many of the best Russian poets are now expatriates
(like Ilya Kutik) or at least spend as much time out of the country as
possible, while others have watched the safety net that was Stalinism
collapse out from under them (such as Parshchikov who, last I heard,
was homeless and living a street alcoholic's life in Moscow, less than
a decade after having been a very successful editor of an agricultural
youth magazine and a stint in California, where the alienness of it all
proved too much). I haven't heard in ages from or about Ivan Zhdanov,
who was already at the Bob Kauffman/Gregory Corseo level of social
tenuousness before the collapse of Communism.
 
There is no question in my mind that many of the best/most exciting
writers of my generation are Russians, but it seems very difficult to
imagine what the future of Russian (or, more broadly, "post Soviet")
writing itself can be under such circumstances. Somebody like Arkadii
Dragomoshchenko, after all, is Ukraine by birth and would, in today's
circumstances, never become part of "Russian" literature alongside a
Tartar from Moscow like Parshchikov or a Siberian like Zhdanov.
 
I have often wondered what it would be like, as a life experience, to
participate in a literature of fewer than 100 million people, like
French (say). Imagine California poetry as a national literature. That
would I imagine change the experience of a "career" as a poet a lot.
Leland Hickman's willingness to publish poets not strictly local to Los
Angeles would have seemed an even more radical act than it was (and, as
it was, it got him pretty well ostracized in LA).
 
And I used to think that some of the great similarities between Russian
and American writing had to do with their vast populations and expanse
and multicultural roots COMBINED (very central) with a deep ambivalence
about their relationship to Europe. But that Russia doesn't exist any
more.

if that term has meaning, tho as Pierre suggests the "Cambridge School"
is, if anything, an even less structured group than the "objectivists". It
hasn't imploded though, it's fragmented, with lots of little plants,
runners or suckers around the place. Sign of good health in plant life.
 
The "Cambridge Poets" are taken quite seriously now, for instance by
Michael Schmidt who teaches at Manchester, and publishes John Riley and
Michael Haslam in Carcanet Press. He has, for instance, supervised
postgraduate work on Grosseteste Review, one of the mags most closely
associated with Cambridge. Much more sympathetic, and broader in range and
insight, would be people like Robert Hampson (Royal Holloway, London) or
Peter Middleton (Southampton), or Tony Lopez (Plymouth). There are also
little enclaves of interest in Essex (John Muckle), York and other places
where I can't place the names. Two sympathetic colleagues in Durham who
do at least read the stuff are Diana Collecott and Gareth Reeves.
 
It's even possible to study Bunting in the UK these days, George: Essex
and York include him regularly in their Masters courses, and of course
here in Durham, at the Basil Bunting Poetry Centre. Being dead helped his
cause no end - I'm working on the same premise myself.

Two new ones from Reality Street Editions, 4 Howard Court, Peckham Rye,
London SE15 3PH (also through SPD):
 
DISTANT POINTS Peter Riley six pounds fifty (yes! he's said to be a
"Cambridge Poet") - the first chunk of a long work built on archeological
reports. Surely someone will do a collected, or even a selected, Peter
Riley soon?
 
O'CLOCK Fanny Howe six pounds fifty - poems written in Ireland and the UK
- good as ever:
 
                Rambling snowmounds and still sheep along
                Cheviot Hills, dense fog, dots of dirt,

Dear Ric C:
 
A couple of days ago you mentioned John Riley's "Czargrad" as one of the best
poems out of the UK in twenty years.  I wonder--if you've time--if you might
elaborate a little.  What, in your opinion, makes it so?  What are some of the
competitors?  Don't mean to put you on the spot:  feel free to ignore this
public query.
 
Regarding the "Cambridge School," I've recently had brought home to me in
correspondence the degree of skepticism about the career and activities of the
late Eric Mottram among some of that group.  The smaller the pie, the sharper
the knife?  Or something more serious?  Another query to be ignored at your
pleasure.

The following message intended for Cristina Brown was returned to me as
undeliverable, so I'm posting it here, as an addendum to recent messages from
Pierre, Ric and George. By the way, I'd like to endorse much of what Ric said
about the US/UK relationship. And to add that while it's good that folks are
getting interested in current French and post-Soviet writing, I'm forever
mystified why "interesting" British poetry is still so widely ignored in the US.
Can't be a translation problem, surely....
 
Dear Cristina,
 
Just picked up your request from the Poetics list. Small correction: John James
lives and works in the city of Cambridge, but not at Cambridge University -
you'll find him at Anglia Polytechnic University. Andrew (not Anthony) Crozier
is at Sussex. Others you may want to contact for leads: Drew Milne, also at
Sussex; Peter Middleton at Southampton. English depts in each case. Ric Caddel
you already know.
 
Worth contacting in the US, as well as Peter Quartermain, who has already been
mentioned: Romana Huk at the University of New Hampshire. Sorry, don't yet have
a proper address for her, as she's only recently returned there after a couple
of years here in the UK - but she's planning a big conference at UNH for 1996 on
current
UK poetries. She's done some work on Denise Riley, John Wilkinson etc.
 
I am not an academic so I'm not the person to suggest to you how to go about
these things, but hopefully you'll find some of the above helpful. Please feel
free to ask me anything though and I'll do my best to help. As you may know, I
was co-editor of The New British Poetry, along with Eric Mottram who sadly is no
longer with us - he would've been the best person to help you but died suddenly
last February.
 
All the best,
 
Ken Edwards

About Lorca's duende & blues, you might want to check out those lyrics in
which the blues are personfied, emerge as living beings, to fill the
singer/poet with deep song, deep thoughts, or draw it out of him/her.  E.g.:
 
        woke up this morning
        blues all around my bed
 
etc. That kind of thing.  And then the way one speaks of having the blues --
not in a negative way but as it allows the song/ the poem to come -- is
very reminiscent of Lorca's duende & his take on cante _hondo_.
 
It's also useful to not forget the popular thrust in Lorca & other germinal
poets of language.

Legend has it that when Dallas Wiebe wanted to do his dissertation on Ezra
Pound, he was told by the department that he couldn't for the same reason
as George Bowering was told he couldn't study Bunting. Wiebe, so the story
goes, then suggested Wyndham Lewis as subject for his dissertation. Reports
tell us that the faculty involved were unsure whether or not Lewis was alive;
as they didn't want to admit this, they approved the dissertation plan.
 
Wiebe was doing his graduate work at U of Michigan.

An aside to Ron's mentioning of poets who write in languages of fewer
than 100 million people. It gets more difficult: think of Hungarian
writers and Finnish writers. But there is another problem too, for
writers who write in French in Quebec or Tahiti, or writers who write
in English in Canada or new Zealand. In Canada the few readers there
are are likely to be reading US writers rather than Canadian ones
because of the US imperialist control of Canadian distribution.
Concerning your question, Ron, about Califormia being a national
literature. What if it were all in Spanish?

But, Ron, the title "All Acts Are Simply Acts" is, to my mind, wholly ironic, and everything in the book works against it. When acts are simply acts we can charm ourselves with such matters as the placement of words on the page. Or whatever.

Re Williams & "boring": I was in a "workshop" back when I was young in which
the "teacher" (an award-winning poet w/ major trade publications) read us,
what else, The Red Wheelborrow & then asked the class "what is this poem
about"-- he got several responses none of which were *the one* he was looking
for-- after a bit of silence he sd, quite seriously, "well, obviously it's
about Spring."

I've been following the conversation about Eng writers and
Universities. It's good to know something is happening with
Bunting and the "cambridge"poets, Mottram etc. It always seemed
strange that way back in the fifties there was a total silence abt
U.S. poets and poetics in Britain (as far as I cd tell). It was not
till I got to New Zealand that I found out what was missing
from my education (at Cambridge). It was Creeley's writing
that sent me hunting for Bunting's books in London in 1977 (damned
 if I cd see much.  "Who?" they said in places like Hatchards).
Good luck & cheers

Ron -- re small nations: you should come along next time I travel back
to my own tribe, the Grand-Ducal nation of Luxembourg, with only
370000 bona-fide members & I'll take you to one of our writer's union
meetings -- about 65 members strong right now, writing in several
different languages -- Letzeburgesch, French, German, Portuguese,
Italian & one or two even in English -- it's strangely exhilerating to
note that books of poetry by eithewr of the two small presses over
there are printed in editions of 1000 copies -- which is about the
same as small to medium presses over here do.

The volumes of DLB which Kit Robinson refers to (v40, 1985, two parts) are
useful as a starting-place for UK poetry up to the early eighties. Because
they claim to cover ALL UK poetries of that period, there are a lot of
boring people in there, and a lot of interesting ones left out (presumably
a lot of boring people left out, for that matter...). The interesting
inclusions include: Hollo and Raworth (as noted), Prynne, Roy Fisher, Gael
Turnbull, Tom Pickard, John Riley, and a really spiffy one on Lee Harwood
by me. There's also a little press round up, which leaves out much
(including Fulcrum and Trigram), but includes Ferry, Grosseteste, Migrant,
Goliard, Writer's Forum and Pig Press!
 
One hopes that one day Bruccoli-Clark will do a follow-up volume. But
spare a thought for those wandering souls who fail the country-of-origin
test of these strictly controlled formats: for instance, where would Pierre
Joris appear? Answers on a postcard... (Pierre: would you like to say
what volume you'd like to appear in, and who you'd choose for company?)
 
Keith, it's far better to put me on the spot about "Czargrad", I tried to
write about it years ago and failed (the bits I did write about John
Riley are referenced in DLB40). Besides, I'm sure you recognised my
blurb-writer's mode in any claims I made for it. Read it: It's a sustained
piece of musicality, written at a time when Riley had assimilated the
bits of "open field" which he wanted, (and rejected the bits he didn't
want) and was revelling in life in general. It relates to his conversion
to Russian Orthodoxy, but it's not an evangelical tract - Riley's "Holy
City" is more closely related to the down-to-earth suburb of Leeds where
he lived, tho it's infused with little bits of European history. And
light - there's light everywhere in Riley's poems.
 
One of the accusations made against the Cambridge poets (generally,
rather than specifically) is that they're icily "intellectual"
("intellectual" is a term of abuse in UK). Nobody could ever accuse John
Riley of being icy.
 
Well, you did ask...

tom -- this is not the source you're trying to remember -- but look at
Bob Kaufman's poetry for a direct link between Duende and blues -- not an
assertion that it's the _same_ phenomenon (I don't see how it could be)
-- but a crucial link -- also in the Steve Jonas book that Ed Foster
published a bit over a year ago --  and Jayne Cortez ,,,, and so on

Ken -- who was it remarked that Britain and America are peoples divided
by a common language?
 
The real problem I see is the simple one of distribution -- _most_ of the
poets mentioned recently, even those of the Cambridge "school" -- are not
easily found in US book stores -- (Hell, for years you couldn't even buy
a copy of Wilson Harris here, and he's published by Faber!) --
 
When I do spot an interesting British poet in a mag. or an anthology (or
hear about one in a Tuma talk somewhere) -- then I can start working the
phones to turn up a copy -- but it ain't easy -- even the Caracnet titles
I've gotten over the years have all been found in obscure used book
stores -- though I would hope none of what I just said is true in NY --

why is williams boring, jordan? aside from the fact that so much he did had been done by others better, it has, i think, much to do with the fact that he believed in evidence, like answers to a question. in yr mom's terms, yes, nj is boring.

Pierre:I think Jeff Humphries is working on a translation of
_A Field of Islands_, but I don't know when and if it is coming out.
I know you can read an excerpt (those of you who are EnglishOnly) on
the LSU campus gopher under Body_L: literature electric and new.
     Great stuff, incidentally.
Thanks, Eric.

Aldon, isn't this difficulty of transatlantic interconnection
largely due to book-sellers agreements on trading. American
publications are pretty well invisible in Britain aren't they?

In the later 1960's Art Historians in London decided that Modern Art
could  be taught, but not examined, because my informant (Leo
Ettlinger) said nobody yet knew finally what it meant. My then colleague
Ivor Davis, in Edinburgh, taught and examined Modern, and was duly
persecuted for same. But survived.

OUP reissuued Bunting's collected poems, as a cheapskate photographic
copy of the long-out-of-print Fulcrum (1968) edition. It wasn't until
1994 that they actually reset Bunting, in the new "Complete Poems".
 
It was Bunting who introduced me to Creeley's work, as he did to

Hope you don't mind this being public.
 
I did find a Fulcrum The Spoils in 1977. And got hold of the

What's London done to you? I still visit, tho I haven't lived there

There's a pop-flamenco group called Pata Negra
whose recording "Blues de la Frontera" is a musical
example of the blues/ duende link being discussed.
Incidentally, there's another group by the name of
Amalgama - a collaboration between jazz and flamenco
musicians from Spain and the Karnataka College of
Percussion, from India -  whose work testifies to
the important cultural link between blues/ jazz and
gypsy cante jondo that the Indian Raga provides...
 
-Stephen Cope
 
(O, and both groups can be found on a 3-CD compilation
 called "Duende: The Passion and Dazzling Virtuosity
 of Flamenco," put out by Ellipses Arts (Rosalyn, NY)
 last year. Not the greatest title, but a decent comp-
 ilation w/ decent liner notes...

Subject:      Re: your american cousin
 
          Aldon, distribution is governed by sales generated by interest.
British poetry doesn't get distributed much because there's not MUCH
interest. BUT we already know from previous discussions here that US small
presses are having a tough time with problems of distribution as well. The
reservations, for distributors, about dealing with small presses from other
countries much compound what is already a reticence on their (and the
poetries' audiences?) behalf.
 
          Visibility of British Poetries most compatible with a broad
swathe of viewpoints from this poetics list (not writers more generally put
out by Carcanet or Bloodaxe, so much as those poets found in 'A Various
Art' / 'The New British Poetry' or the forthcoming 'Conductors of Chaos')
has diminished over the past 15 years both here and in the US. While small
press publishing and little magazines are arguably on a slight optimistic
up trend here, and there is a blossoming of grass roots organising and
networking, new writing is often published in samizdat style editions of
100 copies or less. (NB there are notable exceptions  -  Pig Press, Reality
Street among them). Hell even the Paladin series (of which Raworth's
'Tottering State' must be the most widely known Stateside) was remaindered
after mostly only about 6 months on the shelves. Useful collections such as
'Future Exiles' have simply been hastily pulped!
 
          Curiously, for some of the writers living here (and I imagine in
NZ as well) there is a feeling (emergent on this list) that their closest
peers and readers lie at least as frequently in the US as 'at home'. The
old adage you quote of being 'divided by a common language' need not become
a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's a term most appropriate to those
xenophobic literary hacks who are the most tedious of standard english
standard bearers. I'd characterise 'us' as more united by antinomian
tendencies. We're seeking to explore pathways of exchange and discussion
and distribution of both product and process for work in poetry which as
Allen Fisher puts it remains 'necessary business'. Part of that is a
post-nationalistic desire to present appropriate ways for exchange that do
not follow the business-imperative driven cultural asphyxias of
multi-national role models.
 
unity in diversity is strength in depth
love and love

While teaching *Spring and All* last year, I had a similar response
from a student (a good student, too) who had been told by her high
school English teacher "The Red Wheelbarrow" was an allegory of the
cold war. You know, the "red", the "white", tools, all that. Maybe
it's a Canadian thing.

Yes, it's a problem, and not one that we look to bookstores to answer.
Various UK small presses are available through SPD: Pig, Reality Street,
North & South, Spectacular Diseases spring to mind; and Segue take some
too. Over here we go to Alan Halsey, Paul Green or Compendium for US
books: I've no idea if that would work in reverse. Heaven knows how we go
about finding out what's goin on in, for instance, New Zealand, other
than - as always - asking a friend.
 
Booksellers tell me that it's BECAUSE we all use these "specialist"
outlets that "trade" bookshops don't touch smallpress poetry imports. The
expression "bullshit" springs to mind.
 
As for London, Tony, since you asked in public I'll tell you: many
wonderful things (including some of my best friends) are or have lodged in
that city, which Cobbett called "The Great Wen". It's just that when I go
there my breath clamps, I have to shout to be heard, the beer's too
pricey, and I can never ditch the feeling that I'm about to get exploited.
As the home of a central government which has sucked the regions dry for
about four centuries (and hasn't done any favours to most Londoners
either), it creams off national resource to support its mainstream
cultural icons (museums, orchestras, galleries etc) as if it owned them,
and when regional resources come into the country (as in European Union
funding), they get stuck in the "Capital" and creamed off by central power
(I can support this statement at great length, If you like...). Hey, this
internet thing is secure, isn't it?...
 
Just a personal thing, I guess...

        I was intrigued by Chris Cheek's remarks concerning British
distribution of poetries "most compatible with the broad swathe
of viewpoints from this poetics list."  During the past three years,
I've become particularly interested in the "distribution problem."
The poetics list is well aware that only one major distributor for
such work remains in the U.S.: Small Press Distribution.  During the
past two years, I served on the NEA Small Press panel, chairing
in the second year both that panel and the panel on distribution,
during which time I attempted to the best of my ability to
represent the interests of presses associated with the poetries of
this list.  The task required considerable patience and humor.
Finally, I was also able to move that future distribution requests
be raised to $100,000.  All of this may be moot by now, but the
experience was quite educative.  The panel on small presses was
persuaded to be generous.  During the second year, the budget axe
fell so deplorably early in the list that many presses which would
have or did receive grants the first year did not in the second.
 
The tax law "reform" requiring publishers to pay tax on
wharehoused books must be rescinded.  The twenty-five or so
remaining literary bookstores must be supported to the
exclusion of even the most seemingly "literary" of the chains.
It might please this list to know that Luisa of the Grolier in
Cambridge (US) survives these days on the sale of poetry associated
with the various interests of this list.  She can be reached
at 1-800-234-POEM, and ships promptly.  Her stock is extensive.
 
While in Prague this past summer, my Czech friends were lamenting
that, during the past five years, editions of poetry and serious
prose had "fallen" to two or three thousand copies.  The population
of the new Czech Republic is ten million.  The Hungarians were
similarly chagrined.  They falsely believed the situation to be
better here, and were stunned when I gave them the statistics I had
collected while serving on the panel.
 
The "problem" of distribution is political, and not simply a matter
of supply and demand.
 
Best,
 
Carolyn Forche

This may be one area (always look to a technology as a large shift but
maybe with a small gain) that the electronic medium may help--and is
of course the idea behind the EPC's small press and little magazine
areas. (These areas specifically design to promote paper materials.) I
suspect there are many more readers for some of this material than we
think. (OK, maybe a few more.) But think of the possibilities--a
central set of links--or several overlapping centres/centers of
links--where such information can be housed. Listings are free. What
has surprised me is that more presses don't list. But maybe that is
something to come. We have had good reports from some publishers for
whom we have posted announcements, that they see results. Of course
this is why I try to encourage publishers to also provide samples of
work; and we also maintain an area of pedagogical material--since if
one small press book could be brought into every course it would
change everything. But anyway, a place to find out about these
works. Thinking largely, also, of people in regional situations (or as
you say in other countries) where there may not be a place to browse
such materials. Hopefully this medium is serving as another possible
bridge.

My favorite explication of "The Red Wheelbarrow" was one I got, which
explained that it was a tribute to the American Farmer. I mean so
much depends on him.
 
About being bored with Williams, I would adapt Samuel Johnson's
remark, "He who is tired of London is tired of life." People bored
with Williams should go sit on the curb and wait for the trash people
to take them off. Makes me think of the old woman in the ambulance in
the Williams poem: "What are those things? Trees? Well I'm tired of
them."

- Interesting comment, professor. Personally, I was bored with all the poets I
read straight thru grad. school, but that didn't prevent me from reading them
on my own where, without doubt, I got much more from the readings.  Still, I
never encountered that kind of remark. Maybe you were kidding (?)  Anyway, why
do you think students may be bored by Williams or any other poet?  Why do you
think there is an need felt by students to explicate a poem in the first
place?  I remember after 40 minutes of talking about a poem in class as an
undergraduate, the instructor thought it went pretty well.  But outside, among
students, the feeling was still 'who the fuck cares.'   I've kept at poetry
despite all the professors I've had, and altho some were very good, very few
could make a viable connection between the poetry and the students.  Usually
the points were made between the poetry and the poet; the relevance of the
poetry to the student being a matter of little significance.  It's frustrating
to hear such abstractions as a "general readership" in this country denigrated
as a bunch of silly asses who can't appreciate the diverseness and
sophistication of American literature.  The question is: what can we do about
it?

an aside to George's aside -- two decades ago the Casa de las Americas
prize for best literary work in Spanish in the Americas went to Rolando
Hinojoso for the first of his Klail City novels -- the author was a Texan
-- for many literary academics in the U.S. at the time it came as a
surprise that major literary works were being written in Spanish in the
U.S. --
 
As Victor Hernandez Cruz says of Nebraska: "In this part of Mexico they
speak English."
 
some of the others on this list probably had experiences similar to mine
in college -- when I announced that I was going to read Spanish as my
"tool" language for a future graduate school, my undergrad. advisors
cautioned me that no "serious" criticism was written in Spanish -- I
couldn't help wondering how they would know that --

never been to Britain, so don't know -- can somebody who's looked for
books in both the U.K. and the U.S. answer this?  Particularly with
regard to mid. sized & small presses?  I can get "Spectacular Diseases"
stuff here -- and journals like _Third Text_ -- but not much current
British verse --

Keith, a Degree in Skepticism is an apposite proposal. At least some of
Eric's writings (both essays and poetries) would make the reading list.

Comments: To: poetics <poetics@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>
 
the woman in the ambulance who was tired of trees was the narrator's english
grandmother, wasn't she. (did wcw really have an english grandmother? it
doesn't matter.
 
to me trees are tiresome as moral mirrors but wheelbarrows are not.
it is an innovation that hasn't lost its character as such.
 
i hear in "So much depends upon....etc." a quite desperation,
 a very american quiet desperation.
 
a lot of williams is boring like a lot of a lot of people. but a lot is
not, including that moral wheelbarrow.

Right on duende.  Right on!--as one was wont to say.  The power and
the enabling force of the popular (perhaps a troublesome word) is not
to be forgotten.  I am reminded particularly of Claude McKay's brilliant
insistence on this in *Banjo*.  As a poet, McKay was straightjacketed to
some extent.  He swerved to prose and to that special source/spirit
that inspired (breathed life into) Lorca and lots of folks who
have found blues, North African seaports and Marseilles simpatico.
Pardon the digression on McKay, but he importantly resisted mainstream
and assimilationist dismissals of work and lives that might well be
associated with duende, with a mysterious bundling of beauty and pain.
 
 
To others, thanks for the Lorca and Mackey suggestions, but this
was exactly the point of departure for my question.
 
There are two very different peridical numbers just out, re: jazz.
1) boundary 2, which is mainly interviews of some jazz greats
2) the most recent issue of African American Review, with a nice
piece by Lorenzo Thomas and lots of very nice short takes, including
a 1918 New Orleans Picayeune denunciation of the amoral animalism of
jass and jassism--- yessssss

Yes Carolyn, I completely agree with you  -  as far as the big picture goes
and how the small picture is affected by the big and so on.
 
My suggestion is, and was when this subject last came up, that we have some
power as a community (albeit one of interests and of communities with
diverse constituencies) to buck the imposition of structure. Loss rightly
asserts the potential of the EPC in such regard. I'm heartened to hear of
Luisa  -  do you have an e-dress or snail address for her? She sounds
somewhat along the lines of Paul Green here, who's been mentioned already.

The list has no memory, I know, but....

Weinberger wrote:  "Today, who among _Sulfur_
readers (which I take as the progressive, but not
radical flank) can spot the ear of Alfred Corn,
or distinguish between Howard and Stanley Mosses?"
 
No significant change in terms--more accurately:
principles of division--in FIFTEEN years (down even
to the immortal strategy of making fun of the foreigner's
name).
 
Just an observation (not a just observation).

Hmm, many decades ago, when I was qualifying for grad school, I chose
Spanish as my second language at UBC. Maybe because the university is
situated on a promontory of Vancouver called Spanish Banks.
 
But I still read Bioy Casares mainly in English.

Why the hell should the professor make a "viable connection between
the poetry and the students"? That is the students' job, if they
think that is important. If they are bored by poetry, let them go and
take a course in paleantology and look for a viable connection
between themselves and some trilobite.

Aldon: Sadly, most of the British poets mentioned recently are not easily found
in UK book stores either. They're published by small presses which don't have
access to nationwide distribution. But some at least can be obtained in the USA
from Small Press Distribution in Berkeley.

I must say that I don't know if they like doing mail order business or not,
but Woodland Pattern Book Center is far better than Grolier for poetry,
and, I believe, particularly for poetry which people on this list might
want to find. This is not to knock Grolier, and I know if I was in
Cambridge I would go there and buy some books, but what they carry is, I
believe, more limited in terms of the interests of this list than Woodland
Pattern, or Talking Leaves in Buffalo, or, certainly, the bookstore at
Small Press Distribution in Berkeley (& they most certainly do mail order
business).
 
Woodland Pattern's address is
P.O. Box 92081
Milwaukee, WI 53202
Telephone 414-263-5001
 
Small Press Distribution's address is
1814 San Pablo Ave.
Berkeley, CA  94702
Telephone 510-549-3336
 
I don't have an address at hand for Talking Leaves in Buffalo.
 
I know the discussion of bookstores and how poorly or well they serve
poetry has come around and gone around on this list before, so I apologize
if these comments seem repetitive.

Thank you, Carolyn, for pointing out the need for change in the tax laws on
warehousing books. Also thank you for your support of various presses on
the NEA panel. Even from across the room year before last (where I sat on
the magazine panel), your support of presses publishing innovative poetries
was obvious & welcome.
 
One other sad note on distribution. Inland Books, which hasn't perhaps been
primarily a literary distributor, but which has over the years distributed
books for a number of presses (including Chax, although not many books and
the payment record was strange) is, according to a recent report I heard,
going into bankruptcy. I have also heard of another distributor of which I
do not know the name, but which is the primary distributor for New Rivers
Press here in Minneapolis, going through bankruptcy. While bankruptcy
doesn't necessarily mean they will cease to exist, it is nonetheless
disturbing and makes the situation of independent publishing in this
country even more tenuous. Thank the stars (as well as many real people)
for Small Press Distribution. Long may it wave books.

Perhaps; but responsibility for the students to create their relevance
falls on their shoulders just as much as on the prof's--as your comments

In Compendium, for longest the most consistantly useful bookshop for small
press poetry in London and the UK. (interestingly in the mid 1970s
Compendium had 3 shops in close proximity, one of which had an upstairs
dedicated, as I remember it, almost entirely to poetry little presses and
poetry magazines  - not there is just one shop and poetry occupies one
range of shelving about 2 metres long and 10 feet high) There's a presence
of books published by Sun and Moon, Black Sparrow, Station Hill, Burning
Deck, Potes and Poets, Roof, Coffee House and a smattering of magazines
(assorted copies of Sulfur, Poetics Journal, Talisman).
 
Inadequate and frustrating, but something.

But I recall Anselm Hollo some years back talking about his period in
London working for the BBC in the 1950s (I believe it was), that one
could get ANY American small press book in the UK then without great
difficulty and that that, more than anything else, was what had changed
the scene and then itself changed over the course of his life. Of
course, much of what made that possible was the paucity of small press
titles during that era.

True Ron, & it was even more so a few years later -- when I moved from
NYC to London in 1970, the poetry section in Compendium Books, run by
Nick Kimberley, was better than any poetry section in any New York
bookshop at that time. (There was also Better Books where many poets
worked). But by the middle seventies, with Nick losing inetrest
(reggae got him) & the energy in the shop going towards radical
gay/lesbian politics, the poetry section withered away. I've always
wondered about the confluence of a wider public interest in (buying)
poetry & the presence of those one or two competent individuals making
the books available.

"Poetry is for interested people" - Zukofsky
 
Plainly, if your aim is to reach large numbers of people, contemporary
poetry, which is widely recognised as "difficult", isn't the vehicle you
should select. Likewise, if you want a course that's going to be easy to
relate to and not give you any problems, you should give the modern poetry
option a miss. In fact, most courses will present such difficulties, since
the idea is usually to present something you don't know about.
 
People don't publish in "small presses" simply because they can't be in
"big presses", and as writer and publisher I've no real interest in
increasing circulation to "big press" dimensions (a Pig print run is
c.500; an OUP current poetry print run is c 1700 - so statistically
similar against a UK population of over 58 million as to be not worth
arguing about). But I started publishing because I didn't see the books I
wanted to read, and was concerned from the first to reach others in the
same situation. I'm still working on it. Early interest from the US (based
on two or three shops and half a dozen people) suggested to me that there
at least was a vast continent of articulate and enthusiastic readers of
new poetry: I'm beginning to suspect that this is not the case...
 
So, one deals in twos and threes. Because much of the material IS
problematical in some way, it doesn't do to compromise over something
like production: in the UK we have a supposed "small press distribution"
organisation called Password, which I dropped out of some years back when
they started to tell me what shape and size and format the booksellers
wanted "my" books to be, and even what sort of covers to put on them.
Usually the suggestions related to increased standardisation for ease of
handling. Now: I design books in order to present texts to readers - the
booksellers can either help in this process, or get out of the way and
sell pulp. Most choose the latter, and that's fine by me.
 
Interesting to hear the situation in the Czech republic and Hungary, how
closely it matches Poland and Estonia (Estonia has an Estonian-speaking
population of a million, and at the start of the decade they could sell a
whole edition of new poetry - 50,000 copies - in a day). Poets in both
those countries are now involved in short-run publishing, very much as
Chris Cheek describes it. And very exciting it is too.

It's worth saying, as an addition to Cris Cheek's useful summary, that
one of the most frustrating things about Compendium's poetry shelves in
the 90s is near zero recognition of the huge renaissance of avant-garde
writing by female American writers since the 80s; no Harryman at all, no
Dahlen, some Hejinian and Howe, no Day, no Darragh, no Bellamy, no Ward,
no Marlatt. There's none of the interesting younger American poets, under
thirty, say. And there's very few gay American writers from the 80s, no
Steve Benson's Blue Book, for example. In other words, very little avant-
garde writing that, as tended to happen interestingly in avant-garde writing
in the 80s, that wears feminist or queer politics *explicitly* (eg the
author both reads linguistically difficult writing and proudly declares
membership of the women's movement or the gay rights movement). Since a
lot of the younger Americans who I read take it now as granted that you can
do this, be avant-garde and declare membership of these movements, so that
they don't always have to, it's no surprise to me that their work doesn't
get stocked at Compendium either; the initial shocktroops never got sent
in.

Well, Ric, it's a funny ole question: there is a level at which I
don't care (& even relish not being included in anything based on notions
of belonging defined by the nation-state, that monstruous
euro-creation).There is, however, a deeper level at which I obviously
would like the work to be, if not "included," then made visible --& in
that do feel a nomadic "belonging" to any of the various geographical places I
have spent time in. The company is vast & changing -- that is the
great pleasure of the nomadic -- impossible to define once & for all.
In a way, the anthologies that Jerry Rothenberg & I have put together
(Vol I out later this month) are my/our company: there's a couple
hundred plus writers from all over the world in those books -- looks
like home to me!

This is indeed a terrific problem, partly because the Brit establishment
(in TLS, LRB, etc) is even more entrenched and narrowly focused than ours
(and that's saying a lot!) and so it's hard for "alternate" poetries to
break through.  But I actually think it's gotten better the last few
years, what with Peter Gizzi's EXACT CHANGE YEARBOOK with that great
Anglo-Irish portfolio ed. Tom Raworth, Prynne's Chinese portfolio, and
chapbook and so on.
 
I think something can be done: namely, poets in the U.K. should routinely
send a copy of their chapbooks, little mags, etc. to U.S. journals like
SULFUR, CONJUNCTIONS, DENVER QUARTERLY, LINGO, TO, TALISMAN, CENTRAL PARK
etc.  Anthologists should consider seriously opening up the field and
being sure to include U.K., Australian, NZ, and other poetries in English
rather than the endless mononationalism we now endorse.  Look at those
titles: AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW, NEW AMERICAN WRITING, AMERICAN BOOK
REVIEWetc.  And rather than ghettoizing U.K. poetry in a course called
"Contemporary British Poetry" we should  be sure the contemp poetry
courses themselves are multinational.

Wilson Harris is a writer born in British Guyana who's written many novels,
including the Guyana Quartet (Palace of the Peacock, The Far Journey of
Oudin, The Whole Armour, & The Secret Ladder) & the Carnival Trilogy
(Carnival, The Infinite Rehearsal, & The Four Banks of the River of Space)
both published by Faber & Faber & relatively available in the US. Harris
has some poetry that I haven't read and a good book of criticism/theory.
There are several books about him and a chapter or two in Nate Mackey's
Oxford Press book of essays. There's also a big feature on Harris in issue
#6 of Mackey's mag Hambone.
 
It's been a while since I read any of the work. Sorry I can't be of more help.

Subject:      Persian Gulf Poetry
 
I hope some of you might be able to assist me with a question. I'm working
with a graduate student here who is planning a thesis on Persian Gulf War
poetry. The twist, however, is that he's interested only  in poems written
about the War by participants and witnesses, not those penned stateside
during or after the fact by those with no eyewitness perspective on the
conflict (i.e., recent work by William Heyen or Denise Levertov would not
do).  We've identified a number of books and broadsides that may or may not
be relevant, since in most cases it's impossible to determine from an
online record whether or not a given author was actually in the Middle
East.  So, if you've run across a relevant poem in a journal or anthology
whose author was identified as being a PG vet, or if you have personal
knowledge of a poet who was there, please let me know privately at
fmm1@cornell.edu.  The student is himself a Gulf War vet.   Many thanks.

so much + wheelbarrow + chickens = codependency?
 
It's been a long time indeed since anyone advanced to me seriously the
argument that publishers and distributers respond to "interest" levels --
at least in the context of literature (ass opposed to instant books about
Randy Weaver or advice on how to lose weight by reading romance novels) --
 
Many of us, for example, have been trying to get an American edition of
C.L.R. James's _Minty Alley_, or even U.S. distribution of same for
teaching in college courses -- no go -- I could go on with other examples
of demonstrable "interest" -- but you see the point -- Was there really
that much more interest stateside in the poetry of Paul Mulddon (who I
_am_ interested in) than any of the other poets of Ireland & England
mentioned here of late?  Interest, as you see whenever you pay your
credit card bills, is created as often as it is catered to --
 
ah humanity--

Harris may not have been the best example for me to use on this list,
since he hasn't published much poetry since his first book.
but--
 
Wilson Harris is a prolific and poetic novelist from Guyana -- C.L.R.
James once called him "the strangest of living novelists," but James
hadn't read Harry Matthes at the time!  Best starting point might be the
_Guyana Quartet_, a gathering of his early books available from Faber &
Faber.  His books were difficult to get in the U.S. till about 10 years
ago, at which point his Faber volumes suddenly began to appear in US
bookstores --
 
Recent issue of _Callaloo_ has a special Harris section ably edited by
Nate Mackey -- also good chapters on Harris's work in Mackey's book
_Discrepant Engagement_
 
_Palace of the Peacock_ is one of the greatest novels I've ever read!

Pierre: Not sure this will help, but I can tell you what happens on
my machine. After hooking up to gopher.lsu.edu, or using one of the
various menu systems to get there, you should see a list of options
ranging from Libraries, Student Life etc. One of them should be
LSU-BR Campus. Select that and you should get another menu, on
which "Body Electric" should appear. After that it's a fairly simple
matter of following the prompts.
     But of course I am directly wired  up to LSU's system and it is
possibly a lot easier for me to hook up then you. Good luck.
     Thanks, Eric.

Exactly right, Marjorie! _Pour la petite histoire_ re the Brit
establishment, when Paul Buck & I did an anthology of the New British
poetry in the very early eighties, the only place we could publish it
was -- as a bi-lingual book -- in France. I sent the book to a range
of Brit publishers, suggesting an all-English edition -- most of them
didn't even bother to answer. It was roughly at the same time that I
was fired drom the _New Statesman_ as poetry reviewer for having
suggested to write a negative review of Dannie Absie's Collected
Dreck.

Robin Blaser runs into something like Pierre's situation. In Canada
he has not been in many anthologies (he's been in mine and Ondaatje's
and Thesen's) because he used to be a USAmerican. In the States he
doesnt make the anthologies like Hoover's because he is a canadian
citizen. Of course some other people didnt get into Hoover's
anthology, such as Lew Welch and Joel Oppenheimer!
 
Then there's Anselm. British or USAmerican? Well, I think he must be
a Finn, because when I mentioned his name to a bus tour director in
Helsinki, she rolled her eyes and said "Oh THAT one!"

"Um - who's Wilson Harris?"
 
I'm new to the list, but I can take a crack @ this one.
 
Harris is a novelist from Guyana, pub'd by faber & faber. Many, like myself,
were probably made aware of his work by Nate Mackey who frequently publishes
him in HAMBONE. The Fall '86 issue (#6) has a special section featuring a
lecture & a Q&A seminar w/ UCSC faculty & students, as well as some critical
pieces. Mackey's DISCREPANT ENGAGEMENT has 3 essays as well.
 
THE ANGEL AT THE GATE is as good a place as any to start reading.
 
(Someone searching for precedent to NM's dense prose syntax  &
philosophical/lyrical mix wd do well to look at WH. They're very different,
but there was a 'shock of recognition' when I first read Harris.)

Subject:      Wilson Harris, UK poetry & more
 
Thanks to everyone who enlightened me on Wilson Harris. My question was
semi-flippant, out of puzzlement, but he seems pretty interesting from the
descriptions and I shall seek out his novels at any rate.
 
Thanks too to Marjorie for her helpful comments about distribution of poetries
in English, and suggestions for journals to send review copies to - I shall
follow this up on behalf of Reality Street Editions. NB I have addresses for
most of the journals on that list, but not for DENVER QUARTERLY, LINGO or TO.
Anyone help? And if you know of any other journals that would (sympathetically I
hope!) review the products of a UK small press....
 
I remember the Compendium small-press section of the 1970s very well - virtually
the space of a whole shop devoted to small press material. I don't think its
demise can be attributed solely to Nick Kimberley's moving on (he's shifted from
reggae to opera & classical music by the way, now writes articles about it in
the Sunday papers - I saw him recently at a concert and had a good chat with
him). Since the 70s the accountants have moved into the book trade in a big way
and now the game is all about brand recognition, profit margins and turning
product over as quickly as possible. I first recognised the change when I went
into Dillon's opposite London University Senate House one day in the 80s with
the latest issue of Reality Studios, which they'd always taken before. The lady
at the desk glanced at it wearily, said: "I really don't think I can be bothered
with this any more" and handed it back.
 
Ira, you should talk to Mike Hart, who's one of the people running Compendium
these days, and persuade him to stock some of the authors you mention. I've
always found him very helpful.

The thing about Williams was that he succeeded as no other poet has
in doing things that were completely fresh and unexpected. This cost
him readers for most of his life. If you go back to early issues of
those English magazines published around 1910 you find many of his
poems published along with Pound's, along with portions of Joyce's
Portrait, Amy Lowell, Ford Madox Ford, etc.--and Eliot. Then he
couldn't bring himself to climb aboard the High Modernist bandwagon
and his reputation languished for more than twenty-five years.
 
Funny thing how it was Yvor Wnters in the 1920s who wrote the most
admiring and appreciative comments on Williams--though in later years
they made remarks about each other that were kind of like what
generals say about each other years after a war.
 
I do hope that I did not offend anyone by being unable to be bored
with Williams. He does tire me out with his variety sometimes,
especially in Paterson--but that is a case of, as a little girl once
said after three hours of Barnum and Bailey, "Too much circus."

I got cut off from the net, UBC is not very giving when it comes to going
over your account limit.  Anyways, I can't remember if I thanked Jordan
for giving me Todd Colby's address.  So thanks if you were not previously
thanked, or thank you again.
 
        Also I didn't read the 178 messages in my mailbox, just kept on
pushing D, so I'll be lurking for awhile until I figure out what's going
on.  But I'm back for now, but I don't know how long.  I'm not sure when
my account runs out for good.  I think it's december, but I'm not sure.
So if I'm suddenly gone, it's not because I want to be.

Re Williams...Isn't part of the point of Williams's poety to be "boring"?
I mean, somedays I've had enough of bloody swords and crimson ground in
Pound's "Sestina Altaforte" and I'm quite happy to read a bit of Williams
dancing naked around his house.But seriously, "boring" seems to be an
easy word to throw around, although, after teaching Williams to hoards of
skeptic undergraduates, it also seems to be a legitimate word to use. I
would, however, like some elaboration about the way y'all mean it.

I'm sorry that I feel compelled to come out into the light from the
dark serenity of that shadowy world where, I presume, so many lurk (too
dark to know for sure),
 
but anyway this debate about Williams being boring is to me, frankly,
utterly astonishing (Ed Foster: You were kidding about WCW being boring,
right? Or was it Jordan?) and, if it is to be taken seriously, quite
ironic (it is all too uncomfortably similar to an article in the New
Criterion by Bruce Bawer, that retrograde neanderthal who thinks nothing
good has been written--he says in the piece--since Jeffers, and who can't
see in Williams anything but triteness and who attack's Marjorie Perloff's
work on him [correction: attacks]; in other words, Bawer doesn't get it).
 
Williams to me is coming to be the most important poet, in the US at least,
in the century.  He has influenced (forgive me if I am beginning to sound
a bit trite and platitudinous myself--but apparently he needs defending)
poetry so deeply and widely that I guess we are taking him for granted or
simply not seeing what is there, like the air we breathe.  He is solid
like the comforting thingliness of his imagery and his music is subtle
and wonderfully unadorned though precise.
 
To me he has never and I dare say will never be boring. And as I get older
he is ever more wise and heartbreaking, and a cherished friend.

Subject:      permission
 
I would like to ask permission to include a section, or version, or
segment, --maybe it should be called a cutting or a slice or few
verterbrae or a half-pound-- of the renga in a book the title of
which is BEYOND FREE VERSE.  At first I just wrote it up as below
because it seemed to me that it was like asking permission to print a
picture of a snake dance.
 
But then I thought maybe it would be best to allow anyone who wants
to claim credit for any of it to do so.
 
Is this OK?
 
Here is my present text. I am afraid that I do not wish for
suggestions as to taking some other half-pound of it--I liked this
hunk pretty well. But please let me know if what I say about it seems
unfair. I realize that to some people this will be sloppy
scholarship, but I never did get a Ph.D.
 
Also, the format is not right in this message, but that's just my
mail server's way of doing things.

    This poem grew into existence during July and August of 1995,
    and at the present writing shows no sign of ceasing to grow and
    evolve. It appeared in ever-increasing increments, sometimes
    branching off into variant forms, on the Poetics List owned by
    Charles Bernstein and serviced by the SUNY Buffalo Listserver.
    It was supposed to be a "renga," a Japanese form in which two or
    three poets spend an hour or two adding to or capping each
    other's lines, making an interconnected series of tankas. The
    complete rules for the renga are too complex to present here and
    are in any case irrelevant, since (at least as far as I can
    tell) this is a pretty free-form renga. I have not attempted to
    go back and credit all the individual poets with their lines,
    and I cannot remember and do not wish to research this
    complicated subject. To do so completely would produce something
    like a volume of the variorum Shakespeare. I think that Ron
    Silliman had a hand in it early on,  and that Sheila E. Murphy
    may have contributed the last line or two, at least. I regret
    that none of it is mine, and that I cannot pin down any further
    whose lines are whose. At that time there were some 245 members of
    the list, and perhaps fifty active participants. Perhaps Marjorie
    Perloff, a list member, can find a graduate student who could
    use this renga for a dissertation and straighten all this out.

Grateful to Tom Kirby-Smith for putting together a version. I think
it's terrific that he wants to use it in his book. At the same time,
I'd like to place a copy of this version in the collaborative poem
section of the EPC. So I ask Tom if it is ok to use his version
(please reply to be directly: lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu) and to second
the offer to the group in case anyone wishes to object.

How about extracting _all_ the versions from the archives, and combining them
into a hyper-renga, where the reader gets to choose which line to follow next?
You'd end up with a branching structure:
 
                |
               / \
              |  /\
             / \ | \
            /| /\| /\
 
This would give a rich profusion of possible poems, and allow the reader to
capture some of the interactivity that has been characteristic of this vast,
mutating rengasaurus.
 
 
        Tom Beard.

Of course this is a terrific idea. Such a series of files would need
to be assembled, formatted, then marked up. I'd certainly be happy to
provide room for these files in the EPC if anyone were interested in
preparing them...

$20.00 cheaper from Oxford, and maybe two more people could afford to but

My complaint about Charles Bernstein:
 
It seems that before I launch into this letter, I should tell you that
barbarism
is the driving force behind Charles Bernstein's doctrines.  It is worth
noting at
the outset that Bernstein's politics will leave behind a wake of rotten
reaction
sooner than you think.  By this, I mean that to him, acting like vainglorious
roommates is a lot of fun.  He leaves me no choice but to leave the country.
I suspect that it can be safely said that it's shocking just how haughty he
can be.
Only Bernstein could feel that militant artists are any better than drugged-out
ruffians.
 
What this underlines, I think, is that one could argue that he frequently
progresses into displays of authority he doesn't have.  His ignorant fantasy
fits neatly into his detestable model of society.  The world would be a much
better place to live if he stopped trying to stir up trouble.  In order for us
to realize more happiness in our lives, we need to understand that Bernstein
is devoid of all social conscience.  It's my hunch that he leads me to believe
that he is abusive.  I want to talk about the big picture: that is no excuse for
illiterate slobs.  He treats inconsiderate twits as objects.  It's not that I
have anything against boneheads in general.  It's just that Bernstein is living
in a dream world.
 
As it turns out, he seems to think that he is right and everybody else is
wrong.
His statements will cause more harm than good.  Essentially, he can't discuss
anything without talking about vigilantism.  A small child really couldn't
understand that anarchism is irrelevant here.  But any adult can easily
grasp that
Bernstein's idea of a good time is to torture disdainful hippies.  It may be
obvious but should nonetheless be acknowledged that I got off on a tangent.
 
Bernstein's little world is far from reality.  Regardless of what Bernstein
seems
to maintain, his beliefs are attributable to an ignorance born of fear.  So
don't
tell me that I'm bewildered by the abominable pretentious nature of his
practices
just because he thinks he can impress us by talking about "unexceptionableness
this" and "phytosociological that".  In theory, what he seems to be
forgetting is
that he is up to no good.  But in reality, the use of long run-on sentences,
bad
metaphors, multiple misspellings, and inappropriately-placed $5 words like
"reticuloendothelial" does not help his cause at all.  I am not mistaken when I
say that you'd think he would see how stingy and unrestrained he appears.
Bernstein
has the gall to think that uncouth ignoramuses aren't ever anti-democratic.
Like I said, he represents a new breed of uncivilized polemics.
 
Ok, I admit that it disturbs me that these flabby fraternity fellows have so
little
tolerance for differing points of view.  But he is deliberately manipulating
the
facts.  There is little doubt that he can't throw away his integrity and expect
the world to respect him for it.  I had a brief conversation recently with some
sappy teenagers who were trying to destroy our moral fiber.  That conversion
convinced me that Bernstein's desire to influence the attitudes of dominant
culture
towards any environment or activity that is predominantly vapid is
incontrovertible
evidence that he harbors some foolish grudges.  I feel this way because it would
please Bernstein greatly to draw unsuspecting paranoiacs into the orbit of
heinous perfidious fault-finders.  So let me make it clear that if he is allowed
to marginalize me based on my gender, race, or religion, the implications can
be widespread.  Should we blindly trust such uncontrollable self-deceiving porn
stars?
 
In that respect, we can say that he is trying to deflect attention from his ugly
arguments.  As for the lies and exaggerations, I am merely pointing out what I
have observed.  It is important to realize that it's a well-known fact that I
don't see how Bernstein can be so crude.  He gives new meaning to the word
"socially inept".
 
I'm indubitably afraid of smarmy crybabies.  His pigheaded hateful attitudes
are
a shout to the world that, eventually, he will ruin my entire day.  I'm really
tired of grumpy virgins.  To put it another way, I can't let Bernstein
undermine
the current world order.  I am asking the readers of this letter to be aware
that
yellow-bellied jerks like him often think they have the right to foster
cameralism
at every opportunity, by which I mean that he has a long,
commercialism-infested
history of attempts to make my blood curdle.  His particular brand of
interventionism
will abandon me on a desert island by the next full moon.  These are
situations where
certain viewpoints are appropriate and there are situations where they are
not.
No matter what Bernstein thinks, Bernstein is off his rocker.
 
If you need proof that you can see exactly where this is going, then just
take a look
at him.  He always sounds like he's reading a prepared speech.  He is
obviously trying
to bombard me with insults, and unless we act now, he'll certainly succeed.
The only
way for Bernstein to redeem himself is to stop being so filthy.
 
I imagine that none of what he says carries any weight.  I don't see why he
wants to
perpetuate myths that glorify sadism.  A day without Bernstein would be like
a day
without gloomy unpatriotic fascism.  His actions are not just about
antidisestablishmentarianism but also about colonialism.
 
He never seems to listen to anyone else's positions and reasoning.  His
conclusions
represent explicitly his overly accepting attitude towards unctuous
kleptomaniacs.
I urge you to join me in my quest to fight disagreeable bourgeoisie.  The
world would
be better off if Bernstein had never been born, period.  To put it crudely,
he is not
known for interpreting facts rationally or objectively.  The continuing
misunderstandings that some sleazy deadheads seem to have merely underscore
this
point.  And that, in my view, is our real problem.

David, It is probably not a good idea to post such a large document to

I'd liketo add something to the comments about Bernstein.
 
When he was here for the Blaser fest I was just disgusted by the way
he ate french fries. Agh, picked up the ketchuppy ones with his bare
fingers and jammed them sideways into his mouth, while talking about
USAmerican poetry.
 
AND have you looked? He was wearing brown socks with black shoes.

If someone will be willing to do the assembling, I'd be happy to do
the programming to create the Web pages. I've already done some

In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
And flew through windows, lightning green and fine morning
First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The caravan of windows to what they flee
These lace curtains, more gauze than bondage, more
Mollycoddled than aware, thin-spined and pebbling
but narrow in the waist or waspish Sunday years ago
Over coffee topped with whipped cream, the Times blowing
& opining, heavy humid air, cumulus amusing against the

Hello David!
Welcome to the list.
As a sleazy deadhead of the first order & having traveled in Tibet and spoken
with many lamas (not Lamas, mind you) your appearance here was prophecied
unto me & we wld like to welcome you to our boring Williamsian hullabaloo &
say that we agree w/ everything you said abt Charles Bernstein & are hoping
he will consider stepping in for Jerry Garcia so that the transparent
evilisms of post-industrial poetry & music might be more easily located when
the time of destruction arrives.
 
I don't have a watch, but I like to.
 
This
transcript is in a modified Conversation Analysis transcription method.
All *uh*s and *um*s are recorded as well as cut-offs (abruptly cutting off
a word in mid-utterance, indicated by a hyphen at the end of the word) and
restarts (repeating or rephrasing what same speaker just said).  Also,
punctuation is used to indicate intonation.  A comma (,) indicates a
falling-into-rising tone, similar to the intonation used in counting or
listing items.  A period (.) indicates a falling tone, not necessarily the
grammatical end of a sentence.  Pauses are indicated by a period within
parentheses.  Longer pauses can be timed and may be indicated in tenths of
seconds within parentheses -> (.2).   Words in caps are stressed slightly
more than others.  (hhh*) indicates inhalation; (hhh) indicates
exhalation; asterisks around words indicate that they are spoken at a
lower volume than surrounding speech.

I'm sorry, too, that our sex games got so far out of hand.  Yes, I, Kevin
Killian, let us whole thing go too far.  I should never have pushed Dave
Ayre to the very limits of pain and pleasure.  It was I who force him to
say mean things about the man he loves most deeply in all the world-in this
case, Charles Bernstein-before I let him touch me.  I got this idea out of
Proust, vol 3 I believe, when the evil girl forces the musician's daughter
to bring out the picture of the dead father while they make love in front
of it, bringing tears to the daughter's eyes, tears of shame, tears of
remorse, tears of a dark lust that neither Dave nor I can forsake for the
sake of propriety or any other motive.
 
Dave, Dave, did you have to push that send button and broadcast our FOLIE
all over the known universe!
 
There's nothing worse, as Proust always said, than an uppity bottom.
Sorry, all!  And how could you, Charles, have known what a Proustian part
you were playing in this age old drama of revenge, suspense, and long
distance love affairs?
 
Goodbye.

Subject:      A happy result of a long process
 
I know some of you are tired of the whole renga ordeal, but this is my take
on the subject.
 
I was asked to contribute to an anthology of "erotica" (ie porn) called
"Switch Hitters" (from Cleis Press) the premise being, everything else
being equal, that lesbians would write gay male erotica and gay men try our
hands at lesbian erotica.  The editors encouraged me, saying that I, I
Kevin Killian, had one advantage - because I, unlike many of the other male
contributors, have actually  seen a vagina.
 
Still I was stumped for a topic, no, what would Henry James call it, a donnee!
 
So when the renga began to appear, I found it!  My story, "Renga," takes
place at a writers' colony in Connecticut, the narrator is a New Formalist
called Jane, whose tired old poetry has begun to bore even herself, tho it
has won many prizes.  A young girl comes to her bungalow every morning with
her breakfast-this girl, an aspiring, perky language writer, re-invigorates
Jane physically and changes her entire approach to poetics when the two
collaborate on a renga together.  (And much else, since the editors demand
1 sex act on every two pages.)  All this on the sunny beaches of Long
Island Sound and the exquisite, semi-secluded grounds of the writers'
colony.
 
When I was casting about for a name for this vibrant character, the maid, I
was calling her "Karen"-don't know why!  But Dodie suggested, "Lee
Ann"-don't know why!  Anyhow the story was finished, accepted, look for it
in February, and thanks everybody for all your assistance and inspiration .
. . you will all recognize your individual lines of poetry for sure.
 
Okay-see you!

Dear David,
         You won't catch me taking your post at face value, no siree!
If I have one complaint about this list, its the extraordinary failure of
its members to detect irony. Is this a function of the technology i ask
myself or of the much vaunted American innocence (American innocence??*!!)
Well, David, you can't fool me. Your address is MINDLINK. BC. You must be
having me on. My considered opinion is that you ARE Charles Bernstein.
The messge he (Bernstein) claimed to post shortly before your own  was very
suspicious: This Message Intentionally Left Blank. I got the allusion to the
opening lines of Bruce Andrews' CONFIDENCE TRICK immediately, and thus the
reference to his own list leadership. And, of course, recalled the many
resonant 'blank' phrases penned by Arakawa and Gins about whom Bernstein
(you) have written so eloquently. From TO NOT TO DIE for instance:'Each
neighbourhood, nest of fields, acquires a momentum of its own: lets loose a
forming blank: this is a blank screen as much as a blank projection.' And
then
 
     The many-hinged, the cleaved
 
During the cleaving something becomes apparent and something remains blank
 
A group of cleaving, transferring in cleaving, an image or a blank
 
In the sweep of cleaving, the sweep of appearance or disappearance.
 
So, I'm sorry, this outburst of self-hatred, does not change one aorta
my loyalty to you,or--and I say this knowing full well there is a stain of
truth to George's cruel jabs--or lessen one smidgeon your undaunted charm.
        yours truly
           Wystan

re magic names,
 
Keith Waldrop has an entire poem, comprised of 'em. I don't own a copy of
the poem (as it is magic), but I may be able to recall a few:
 
Keith Waldrop:        lad with poker
 
John Hawkes:          jaw he honks
 
I'll ask Keith if he wouldn't mind reminding me of a few others.

Simply to endorse Pierre's placing of himself - and many more - in a
transnational fellowship of poets, and Marjorie's call for the
non-ghettoizing of UK (or any other) poetry. Of course, UK folks are often
accurately caricatured as serials offenders in this: the irony of my
editing "26 New British Poets" for "New American Writing" was not lost on
my ever-ready critics. Paul told me that his transformation from Oink! to
NAW was grant-application driven - having persisted with Pig Press for 23
years I can certainly appreciate that...
 
Could I invite the RENGA PEOPLE to delete the "forwarded message"  symbols
(>>>) from the beginning of each line, unless they're integral to the
structure? On my primitive screen the >>>'s now take up half the width,
and the text is falling off on the right so that the difference between
the renga and "in no way is this a renga" is - at first sight - lost.  But
keep it coming!

Subject:      It is better to be ruined attempting the impossible
Comments: cc: Neil_Lazarus@brown.edu
 
"His work as a whole is a protest against the deadly temptation
to make it easy for oneself by renouncing all happiness and all
truth.  It is better to be ruined attempting the impossible.  The
art he is preoccupied with--tightly organized, seamless, and
rendered completely sensory precisely through its conscious force--
is hardly capable of realization.  But it embodies a resistance to
the unspeakable pressure exerted on what is human by what merely
exists.  It acts as a representative of what might one day be.  Not
to become stupid, not to be lulled to sleep, not to go along: these
are the social stances sedimented in [his] work, a work which refuses
to play the game of false humanness, of social complicity with the
denigration of the human being."
 
"That the division of labor cannot be banished by denying it,
that the coldness of the rationalized world cannot be dispelled
by recommending irrationality...is a social truth that
has been demonstrated most emphatically by fascism.  It is
through more, not less, reason that the wounds dealt the irrational
totality of humankind by the instrument that is reason can be
healed."
 
"Wittgenstein's maxim, 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be
silent,' in which the extreme of positivism spills over into the gesture
of reverent authoritarian authenticity, and which for that reason exerts
a kind of intellectual mass suggestion, is utterly antiphilosophical.
If philosophy can be defined at all, it is an effort to express things
one cannot speak about, to help express the nonidentical despite the
fact that it identifies it at the same time."
 
"The soundness of a conception can be judged by whether it causes one
quotation to summon another.  Where thought has opened up one cell of
reality, it should, without violence by the subject, penetrate the next.
It proves its relation to the object as soon as other objects crystallize
around it.  In the light that it casts on its chosen substance, others begin
to glow."
 
"The only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair
is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves
from the standpoint of redemption....  Pespectives must be fashioned that
displace and estrange the world, reveal it to be, with its rifts and
crevices, as indigent and distorted as it will appear one day in the
messianic light....  Even its own impossiblity it must at last comprehend
for the sake of the possible.  But beside the demand thus placed on
thought, the question of the
reality or unreality of redemption itself hardly matters."
 
"Theodor Wiesengrund was born in Frankfurt am Main on 11 Septemper 1903.
(Weisengrund-Adorno was the name registered at his birth, on his mother's
request, and it was the name he used as a music critic in the Weimar period.
During his exile in California in 1943, his final, officially registered
name became just Adorno, while Wiesengrund shrank to the initial W.)"
 
 
[The first and second quotes are from "The Artist as Deputy (in NOTES ON
LITERATURE vol.1); the third is from the best piece of writing on modern
poetry that claims to be writing about modern philosophy, "Skoteinos, or
How to Read Hegel" (HEGEL: THREE STUDIES); the fourth quote is from the
section of MINIMA MORALIA called "Memento" (a meditation on writing that
reviles Benjamin's "The Writer's Technique in Thirteen Theses") and the
last is from the "Finale" the same book; the biographical note is from Rolf
Wiggershaus's THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL.]

Subject:      Errata (not so sweet)
 
It's what I get for adding my two cents, but when I called Adorno's
"Memento" section of MINIMA MORALIA "a meditation on writing that reviles
Benjamin's 'The Writer's Technique in Thirteen Theses'" I rather meant to
write "rivals."  But the difference is "thin" as a former teacher of mine
used to put such things.  (I also mistyped "ei" in one of the
Wiesengrunds).
 
As penance I offer the following (quoted without permission as always):
 
"His Words in her heart rather than upon her lips (A&H) correspond to an
old need so authentic modern works are criticisms of past ones (A1)
beloved by the gods and as such he [sic] (A2) So much for Tragedy and
Epic poetry (A2) _hominum_ [sic] _dabit homini_ [sic] _A te petatur, in te
quaeratur, apud te pulsetur: sic, sic_ (A3)

Subject:      Re: SPECIAL AGENCY
 
OK, I'd just like to clear something up. I know David Ayre, I've worked
closely with David Ayre, & believe me he's no commercialism-infested desert
island. We're talking about a man capable of the most inert pseudo-expletive
non-existence. He's sexually attracted to the bandaged, ya know, to the
head-wound type, to the bandaged. His eyes bug out in a serotonin induced
trance at the first whiff of certain crucial facts. His organelles are
self-ordered and invariant, it's disgusting, really. I mean, really. He once
mistook a fire escape for a weapon & is a traditional predator on the tubifex
worm. Christ himself called him an ambidextrous universe. In the end he'll
look like a great bundle of hair.
 
Of all those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to
medicalize sex, it was David Ayre, that smarmy neolithic tryptamine, that
conceived & published the greatest
degenerescence. A farm hand from the village of Lapcourt, Ayre paid no
attention to tremendous noises, & as he became older, asked for EXTRA ORDERS
when the firing started.
 
I won't even begin to describe his 'Master Plan' as it permutates abruptly in
hyperspatial superconductive telepathic rapport Weeping Weeping oer thy cheek
asleep where thy little heart doth rest a chapel of gold secret smiles clothd
in iron wire both cold & heat & no father there & no Anarchist leaders down
among the swine in that hurricane of ooze: this is the Ayre we breath, an
oxidized sandpaper of cyber-assertions growing in our experiment and
cancelling, flattening, defenceless. He is schizophrenic, deaf, & completely
commited to the work ethic. We simply must call a cop or something. The
hospital food is very meagre.  Beware Ayre for it has been written 'No Cult
can make it without enemies." or was it enemas. . . Any case, keep your guns
cocked, no amount or impending demoralization will neutralize his surgical
pedigree.
 
Ayre is an alphabet of actual insects, a sick zone caressed by the warmth of
the rising sun. Rumour has it he reads Poe.  This morphogenetically obtuse
lump of cramp investigation must be talked to nicely, for we have so very
much to learn, my friends.
My dear, sweet friends.

Subject:      Dave Ayre As I Remember Him
 
*****Dave Ayre As I Remember Him*********
 
Let me just say a few words in light of this situation.  David Ayre was a
man.  Truly. He could always get the lids off jars; was always scratching
and sniffing
in places everybody forgot about.
Always needed a butter knife.  Yet above all: the best person in the whole
world.
He was the smartest guy I knew.  He was old Dave.  He was the kindest
soul in the community, never asking questions, always willing to lend his
hammer. He accepted everybody equally.  Every boy loved him. Always had an
opinion.
Never any skin off his back.  Never let the sun go down.
You always knew where to find Dave, even when he told you exactly where
he'd be.  Could be that Dave had seen it all, because he practised what he
pitched.  Maybe he was born that way, or, perhaps, it was in his genes.  In
any case, he was rarely too busy.  He knew how to push the right buttons.
He sure lived.
I think of Dave, holding on, never letting go, no matter how much you begged.
Needless to say, I was shocked when I read about him.  I had trouble seeing
what all the fuss was about.  In any case, it's not the Dave that I want to
remember.  So I say: he will come out in the end.  It is silly to think
otherwise.
He was the stuffing of dreams and, as always, he would continue to make all
the difference.
 
Thank you.

As someone who once lived on Rod Smith's mail route (& not a one of us
thought it accidental that Smith worked the roads around _Man_assas), I
am disturbed by this charge that Mr. Smith has stolen a letter.  Smith is
above all that. Above all, he is honest as the day is, no tin horn like
that Zukofsky guy Foster was always complaining about when people were
waiting for their mail to arrive, for god's sake.
 
None of us around here will sit still for such character assassination.
Smith has taken no letter.  They're all right here where they're supposed
to be; we counted 'em up just to make sure.  I know for a fact that Rod
Smith once walked a mile through the humidity just to return a copy of
_Sulfur_ that had mistakenly been delivered to his P.O. box.
 
It's true that Rod's magazine suddenly sprouted a letter in its title
that had not been there before, but Rod won that letter fair and square
in a poetry slam at the Audubon Society.
 
sincerely,
 
sycorax

Subject:      Re: Dave Ayre As I Remember Him
 
My finest klobucar,
How good to have news of you after so many burning bridges
 
I too remember kind ol' Dave. First laid eyes on him sitting in the back at
that Spicer/Yasusada reading with a copy of Vivekananda. He had that youthful
"in this ocean of existence we are all but wavelets" kinda way about him.
Remember how he taught that sweet pup "Stuckey" to open the RC bottles?
Charity is great, but the moment you say it all, you run the risk of running
into materialism. Dave was like that, always another sweet meaningless
comment while divvying up the loot.
 
And lord the Duchamp show! Attaching playing cards to the bicycle readymade.
. . really freaked that guard's gobble.
And that time we needed to detonate the device, who could we turn to but ol
Dave, (poor Stuckey). And him always quoting that Padgett line, spitting on
us with laughter,  "The natives of Tangiers are referred to as Tangerines."
 
Ah, the old Daves. . . but I don't remember any hammers. We are talking about
the same guy?

Wystan -
 
I've seen David Ayres & Charles Bernstein in the same room.
 
Now that I think of it, you may have as well, but that's another story.
 
In fact, now that I think of it, I've probably seen David Ayres & Kevin
Killian (or was that Dodie?, Kevin usually announces himself) in the same
room too (the same room as Dodie, well, maybe), though perhaps I didn't
know it at the time.
 
Wait, now that I think of it, I think I've seen Wystan Curnow, Dodie
Bellamy, David Ayre, Charles Bernstein, Kevin Killian, and Marcel Proust
all in the same room once.
 
Oops, now that i think of it, it wasn't Marcel Proust at all, it was George
Bowering. I sometimes get the 2 of them confused.
 
On the other hand, now that I think of it, I've never seen no Rod Smith or
Hal Foster, no how.

But this whole thing has been so much not about permissions. First, it's not
a renga, and no one received permission to call it that or to butcher that
form. Also, I notice that some lines (or at least one I wrote originally)
have been altered already, and I don't think anyone asked permission. No one
ever asks permission of the already existing authors to add to the work,
thereby changing it.
 
And do you really think you can get everyone who has contributed to give
permission?
 
Good luck.

When was the last time you went back to *Spring and All* (the whole

superficiality, but they still get me, every time. The anthologies
were always too small to hold this stuff, even that wheelbarrow which
sure looks different in its original habitat.

In fact the phrase was traditionally used, not by the person for whom the
microphone was being readied, but by the sound technician whose job was to
ready it; and the ethos of the boring phrase was exactly its renunciation
of being-worth-paying-attention-to. Making the channel clear is not a
matter for self-announcement; and come to think of it, does Homer ever say
"I"?

Subject:      Jobs
 
Associate Professor of English, U. of Louisville
Phone: (502)-852-5918; e-mail: acgold01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu
 
I wanted to notify the list of two positions that we're seeking to fill here
this year. Both are assistant professorships; deadline is Nov. 10; AA/EOE.
 
1. Specialization in postcolonial literatures in English, with strong interest
in second literary field and/or critical theory.
 
2. Specialization in fiction writing; secondary activity in another genre
(esp. creative non-fiction), literary field, or rhetoric and composition
desirable.
 
More details can be found in the job ads in the MLA and Chronicle of Higher
Education. Please, depending on your situation, consider applying or alerting
your students to these opportunities.
 
Given the general interests of the list, it seems a good idea to let you know
that the folks running the fiction search are likely to define that genre in
fairly traditional terms, and not be super-receptive to, say, polygeneric or
indeterminately generic writing--meaning (I'm blathering here) they'll
probably be drawn to people writing stuff that looks like short stories,
novellas, etc. At the same time, I consider one of my jobs in life to nudge my
colleagues beyond the conventional in these matters, and though I'm not
formally involved in that search I will be sitting in on interviews and trying
to open up the field a bit. Bottom line: please write in--I don't want to
discourage you from doing so--but don't get your hopes sky-high. But anyone
who's been on the job market recently knows that.
 
Alan

Subject:      twenty questions
 
Probably the less said about the language of life, and the more about
linebreak the better, but I'm guessing the new radio show out of Buffalo
won't have the kind of grant money PBS did, nor would it use that money to
produce a very slick set of teacher's guides (including 18 poet cards--bigger
and less exciting than baseball cards). Outreach! they call it.
 
Here are some "questions to think about" from the teacher's guide to "The
Language of Life" with Bill Moyers (with apologies to C Forche, the only list
member ((I think)) involved). High school teachers will be asking these
questions to future citizens of our various polises (polices?) in the next
few weeks...
 
Why is "what you dream up" deeper than what you know?
 
What will you do with your time?
 
Why should you be suspicious of what you want?
 
When did you last surprise wounds of your own this long time unmothered?
 
How _can_ we move toward one another?
 
How do you know if you can or can't sing?
 
When do you catch sight of the promised land?
 
What have you been given for your poetry?
 
To what do you pledge allegiance?
 
What is the "myself" that you want to be?
 
What kind of satchel do you carry your poems in?
 
How have you honored that floral apron?
 
When did you last forget _your_ distance?
 
What are the circumstances in which you are reading the poem?
 
What would you aim your poems at?
 
What music is great enough to bring you back?
 
What leads you back to a person you need to remember?
 
What happened before you were born that still matters to you now?
 
 
I'll be collecting your papers next Tuesday, typed, double spaced...

so I thought maybe I could pose my question here.  It is:  who is the

She's holding what looks like a flag and sword.  I would appreciate any

My favourite memory of Dave Ayre: it was probably 1977, in Bolinas.
Tom Clarke was out for his daily marathon run, and Dave was running
backward in front of him, tossing rose petals in his path. Tom was
shouting evil imprecations all the while, but after 12 miles held his
breath and just made gruesome faces. Sometimes Dave wouild run over
the hill and come back with another armload of blossoms. "You
arsehole!" shouted Tom, "just run. Forget the encomia, forget the
silent irony. Just run for daylight. But David smiled wordlessly. He
was listening to his mantra over and over in his cranium, never told
anyone what it was. Tom didnt know, and it was eating his gut.

Well, Gabrielle Welford asked me to go on, and I have been debating
the idea with myself and a few other people here for a few days. I
dont want to tell you all the things that Charles B. did to turn
people's stomachs during the Blaser fest. But when we were having
our, uh, conversation in his room he kept jumping up to move his
framed 8x11 picture of Kevin K. closer and closer. I could not stand
it after a while. I took the thing he had behind the door and ran as
fast as I could for the cleansing waters of Burrard Inlet, heedless
of the accident that might have befallen me as I ran with tears
welling in my orbs.

2) However, after giving the issue some thought, I'm not
sure I agree with piecemeal publication - what is important
here I think is the process rather than the content.  It is

How terribly offensive the discussion has turned re Williams.
 
He is neither vanilla at Baskin Robbins, nor white sauce. And Ron, you
should know better. He isn't butter on biscuits. He is plumb-jam on bagels.
 
Rengas are stinky cheese, or should be.
 
Must it always take an expatriate to set straight those of you in the

Someone asked (rhetorically I believe) if Homer ever uses "I".  So I asked
my husband Stanley Lombardo and he responded:
 
Yes, Homer does say "I" of himself, In Iliad 2, right before the
catalogue of the ships. And in the first line of the Odyssey
he says "me."
 
(Stan's translation of the Iliad comes out next fall.)

Why is "what you dream up" deeper than what you know?  I don't know.
 
What will you do with your time? Besides renga-ing out, "Pinch me
          Alfredo and pass the hot sauce"?
 
Why should you be suspicious of what you want?  Because I want what
          I'm suspicious of.
 
When did you last surprise wounds of your own this long time unmothered?
          The last meeting I attended at work.
How _can_ we move toward one another?
          Try a little push-broom.
How do you know if you can or can't sing?
          I cant.
When do you catch sight of the promised land?
          It pokes out my brain and through my forehead.
What have you been given for your poetry?
          A high-five from Bill Luoma.
To what do you pledge allegiance?
          The doppelg nger of Double Cola.
What is the "myself" that you want to be?
          An American Kestrel.
What kind of satchel do you carry your poems in?
          More like, "What kind of Satchel do you carry your Paiges
          in?"
How have you honored that floral apron?
          Hideo Nomo swats horseflies.
When did you last forget _your_
          distance?
          I never knew it.
What are the circumstances in which you are reading the poem?
          Many.
What would you aim your poems at?
          The inside part of the plate.
What music is great enough to bring you back?
          Meat Puppets.
What leads you back to a person you need to remember?
          Notes.
What happened before you were born that still matters to you now?
          Castro.
 
I'll be collecting your papers next Tuesday, typed, double spaced...
Jordan

Alan -- just out of curiousity -- weren't you guys trying to hire in
postcolonial studies a few years back?  Is this another try, or did
somebody leave?  I know one possible candidate here in the Bay area --

Well, I have to admit I "started" it.  But i agree with Charles Alexander
that that doesn't really make a helluva lot of difference.

In the chooks ere reamed the dreams wear toques
Flew to rue a doer's light ease by tine's din
Worst cardinal lair
 
Bowed asunder sun loud
End less use rushing ruse finds
Raving seeded to flee
 
Placed tains moral-gauzed heads
Coddle-ware spin dribblings
But a row in the ear
 
Fees top peddling owls
"Heady crude"
To each a cage ordered to compass
 
A condiment
Rice feasts toothed
Undid in twos
 
To hose an iffy haze
Fussed into dialing lots
Owls' edgy rental
 
Linguent spread and heft
Just proxy juices
Guesses still lip to print a named rarity

Just curious.

Someone asked (rhetorically I believe) if Homer ever uses "I".  So I asked
my husband Stanley Lombardo and he responded:
 
Yes, Homer does say "I" of himself, In Iliad 2, right before the
catalogue of the ships. And in the first line of the Odyssey
he says "me."
 
(Stan's translation of the Iliad comes out next fall.)

Hello INFO FRIENDS...
 
I sit in sad repose as I put pen to paper
concerning an issue I've found most deeply
disturbing.
 
(sigh) . . .
 
I am not so sure i like this SUPER INFORMATION
HIGHWAY after all.  It hasn't been so super for
me lately.  Let me share with you my sweaty
parting sorrows...
 
I have just been forceably removed from 13
discussion lists including Small Engine and
Firearms Repair, Cyber Ceramics, Online Touque
Mending and Friends For Life.
 
This list is my last refuge, my last hope....  And from
what i've seen so far, things are lookin pretty good !
 
Bernstein, I, like you have a 8 x 11 picture I keep near
to me.  It's the picture of you on the cover of The Difficulties.
Remember it !  Everyone, do you remember it !  You're sitting on
that porch, a full head of hair all comfortably reclined with an
"I just finished reading Ulysses and it only took an hour !" look
on your face all casual with your junky jeans, shoddy vans with the
droopy laces and a distinctly Canadian shirt.
I keep your picture right next to my 40 x 20 enlargement of the Ron
Silliman cigar chomping, crotch spread Difficulties Issue (they kept
that one behind the counter...).     Charles, every time I think
about you, I touch my elf.
 
I am proud to be a member of this list, discussing art farts ache.
I will not fall prey to Mr. Killians horny whims, nor George Bowerings
sleazy nerdisms!  Rod Smith and Andrew Klobucar's epitaphical
exagerations are boneheaded to say the least.  As for for Mr. Levy, I have
never been in the same room with ANYONE before never mind these people
you name.  Do you have PICTURES ?!#$!?  HUH ! and who is this Dodie
Bellamy person anyway ?   Is she for REAL ?
 
To sum it all up, I've had enough of you chauvinist fogeys.
There are three points I need to make here.
.
.
.
And another thing! Andrew, does the word "SEMANTICS" mean anything to you?
And, believe it or not, McKuen is the best-selling poet in modern
publishing
history. His 35 books of poetry have sold over 40 million copies.
But bad news soon surfaced--I know we all share contempt for his popular
books.  McKuen had sold 40 thousand copies of his first volume, Stanyan
Street & Other Sorrows, from his basement before being scooped up by a
Random House.
 
"what is with this david ayre ?", this Lapcourt farmhand,
this great bundle of hair !
 
"what is with this david ayre ?",
this avid deary with the dairy air
I'm just trying to be friendly, tis all !
to all my info friends, so . . .
O !  Mr. Killian, you might well just get me,
or might as well just fist me
(excuse me!)
in the end....
 
yours,
AVID DEARY

San Andres VI- The Balance Shifts
by Cecilia Rodriguez
 
National Center for Democracy, Liberty, and Justice
 
       "Lies, deceits, falsehoods; none of this wiII achieve any
thing. The lies, the threats , the accusations can only bring us to defeat
and take us down the wrong road. Only the truth which walks in our heart can
lead us to a just and dignified peace."
 
                                               Comandante David
                                          Zapatista Delegation-CCRI-CG
 
 
 
 
Historically, the peace talks achieved a duration of seven days.  The
government delegation
appeared  together with the Zapatistas for a photo opportunity.  They
also  responded to a Zapatista proposal with applause.
 
And  the  traditional  indigenous discretion born  of  500  years  of
resistance  received  these historic firsts with  measured  optimism,
and a skepticism born of too many betrayals.
 
Standing and waiting through a diligent rain which soaks through  the
most impermeable
material,  the  observers and the civilians who stand  in  the  peace
cordons watch incredulously.                                       Can it
be  that  the  talks which have been stalled for months will  produce
tangible progress? Is it possible
that  a  day will be possible whose dawn will bring the beginning  of
the end to this terrible siege?
 
The  long  nights shifted between those where stars were  visible  in
the sky and a fog so thick  that it erased everything in view.
 
***********************************************************
 
With  a  massive  force of volunteers, little  or  no  money,  and  a
timeline  of  approximately 8 weeks, the plebiscite of the  EZLN  was
the  most numerous in Mexico's history; 1,088,094 ballots.   It  gave
voice  to  what the Mexican government had hoped would be  silent  or
non-existent; national public interest and sympathy with the  demands
of the EZLN.
 
The  EZLN  celebrated  the  accomplishment with  a  party;  Zapatista
style.  A  meeting  where the official results of the  Consulta  were
reviewed  was held in a small village reached by vehicles  eventually
left  in the mud. The rain did not stop until the ground was a  large
brown  puddle.  The  speeches reviewed activities  in  the  different
states and internationally.
 
            ."
Later the crowd from the cities swarmed into a medium-sized building.
At 9 p.m. it settled into an awed silence as the masked Zapatistas
crowded into one end of the room.
 
"We had prepared a special program but you arrived very late" said one
of them.  "Now we want to ask your permission, shall we present the
program or are you alI going to leave?"
 
 
 
The audience stayed and the Zapatistas presented 3 folkloric dances
and 3 songs. Then the party went on, because the room was warm and the
applause was loud. More folkloric dances were presented with Fin del
Olvido introduced by a masked young woman strewing flower petals on
the dirt floor. Then the audience began to present poems and songs.
Their voices filled with emotion, their faces wreathed in smiles.
 
It was hard to tell who had received the best gift; the results of the
consulta presented to the Zapatistas or the sight of masked young men
and women who for the moment sang and danced. The party continued
until midnight. It celebrated life in the midst of death,  the joy of
struggle, the warmth of companionship, the certainty that in spite of
alI the media clamor to the contrary, a process had just begun.
 
The government of course argues that the Consulta did not result in
the numbers expected, that it did not ask whether the EZLN should lay
down its arms, nor about the ability of the EZLN to represent the
people of Mexico.  Miraculously however, the talks  which the
Zapatistas had called exhausted, continued for an historic seven days.
 
**********************************************************************
******************************
If extremes are the only viable justification for change in society,
then Mexico certainly qualifies. Even Zedillo's State of the Union
address could do little to hide the savagery of  present economic
policies.  There about 8 million people in Mexico's informal economy,
5 million more who earn only one-third of what is considered necessary
to support a minimum standard of life. In order to have a minimal
response to the need for jobs Mexico's economy must grow by 4% per
year. In Mexico City, 70,000 children under the age of 5 suffer severe
malnutrition, a number which has been multiplied six times over the
past 20 years. Only one-fifth of the 670,000 people who are over the
age of 65 have a pension.  Steel and autoworkers in Mexico must work 2-
2.5 hours to earn enough to buy a two pound chicken (in the US they
only have to work about 9 minutes to buy a chicken). In 1995, Mexico
recorded 9,712 cases of cholera with 110 deaths, and 38 cases of
hemorrhagic dengue so far.
 
 
In 1995 Mexico will pay out $57,756,000 dollars on its foreign debt,
which is  a number 204% higher than everything paid from 1821-1976 on
foreign debt. Certainly the achievement of a social transformation
capable of altering these statistics will be a difficult painful and
long process, something which the  Zapatistas clearly understand.
 
 
The review of the litany of human suffering through numbers can
sometimes elicit a human response.  The numbers at the opposite pole
are even more dramatic. There are numbers with many zeros to represent
the wealth of select individuals who remain power to the brutal
detriment of millions.  Shock, dismay, tension, empathy; these are the
emotions necessary to elicit the attention or the media, the gut
reaction of the majority of the public.
 
Yet the silent determination of hundreds of campesinos in the
militarized villages and the patient labor of the Zapatista
delegation go unnoticed, In this age of commercialized emotions. To
understand the trajectory of the Zapatistas requires a different
mindset, one which goes beyond simplistic formulations of power, one
which challenges the distance between many of us and the human
family.
At 2 a.m. when the mist was especially cold and wet I turned to
another international observer and asked, "TeII me something, can you
imagine people in the United States leaving home and family and
standing all night in the rain? What do you think would move people
like this?' "Frankly nothing..  l can't imagine such a thing...maybe
only something which was a direct threat to the well-being of their
families...maybe ."
 
The Zapatistas have distinguished themselves in history by being
willing to advance it, by allowing and fighting for a democratic space
in which the people of Mexico can re-discover each other and
themselves.  This space was first constructed in Aguascalientes,
Chiapas and carved out of the mountain with loving hands. It was
filled by a people, groping to find a different way, a way beyond
parties,  dogmas, and the socialization of 65 years of centralized
government. The space widened in the simple process of the Consulta,
which gave people basic experience in the vague notion of "democracy"'
that social concept expropriated by demagogues and berated by those
who believe it should be neater and more efficient.
 
The Zapatistas know that that space will be rarefied if combat should
begin, that to construct  a social vision common to 90 million people
will require much more than bullets and uniforms. It will require
dialogue, the exchange of ideas and concepts, time, experience, and
the growing participation of millions; none of which can be easily
pursued in open combat.   It will require a new consciousness from
those in the civilian and international movement, one which allows new
energy, ideas and methods of work to evolve.
 
As far as the EZLN is concerned, it is the fact that reason and not
rage or hunger for power dominates their decisions, that the
willingness to sit at the negotiating table exists.  Official
government broadcasts on September 11th announced "  The EZLN and the
federal government have reached their first peace agreement."
 
For seven days the Zapatista delegates sat at the table for 10-12
hours with the government. Then, in short hurried meetings until 2 or
3a.m., they met with countless delegations from around the country and
the world to share their thirst for justice and a peace with dignity.
 
What the government claims is their achievement is in reality a
proposal made by the EZLN months ago.  This round established rules
for procedure and a basic agenda for the negotiations  but it is a
misrepresentation to say that a "first peace agreement' has been
reached. It is procedures which has been agreed on by both parties,
subject to change and far from a substantive theme such as a proposal
to reduce military tensions, something which would do a great deal to
re-establish the confidence of the EZLN in the dialogue. Progress is
visible however in the apparent willingness of the government  to
discuss "national" issues with the EZLN, although a specific proposal
from Zedillo was at one point refuted by his own negotiator, Marcos
Antonio Bernal.
 
The strategy of low-intensity warfare however remains the choice of
the Mexican government and is a preference for the Pentagon as well.
It remains a war of nerves, a war against civilians, a war which the
state-party system continues to wage with impunity.  After the
massacre of 18 campesinos in the state of Guerrero, its people called
for the removal and indictment of the governor.  The PRI announced
there is "insufficient" evidence.  As the elections in Chiapas
approach two incidents in the villages of Tila and Nuevo Limar have
left 4-5 people dead, and dozens of houses burned to the ground by PRI
members and the local police.
The violence promulgated by profound poverty, centralized
authoritarian rule and government-sanctioned repression has not
ceased.  In spite of dozens of government proclamations for peace,
there is little change except cosmetic gestures of reform.
 
Most of the people of Mexico know this.  At the grassroots, in rural
and urban communities, a fierce, implacable determination grows, a
patient faith, a hope which burns and spreads in spite of all the
propaganda, the terror and the manipulation.  Indeed a process has
just begun.
 
**********************************************************************
*****************************
 
To  show  our  support for the Zapatistas the National Commission  for
Democracy  in Mexico, USA has a made a call for "An International  Act
of  Resistance in Support of Democracy in the Americas" for October 9-
12  in  Washington  D.C.  The Act is also a call  to  demonstrate  our
outrage  at,  and  rejection of, the neoliberal policies  of  the  PRI
government,  promoted and supported by the government  of  the  United
States.  In addition the Act is a call to express our support for  the
civic  society  which has committed to struggle  for  the  16  demands
proposed by the EZLN and for a dialogue with respect and dignity  that
would create the possibility of a Mexico that is genuinely free,  just
and democratic for everyone.
 
The fact that the United States government and financial interests are
directly  manipulating events in Mexico implies  that  they  are  also
responsible  for the misery and deaths of the people of  Mexico.   The
participation of the United States in maintaining millions of Mexicans
in  subhuman conditions implies  that those of us who live  here,  who
believe   in   justice,  liberty  and  democracy,  have   an   immense
responsibility to struggle and mobilize against this policy of  hunger
and death.  We can not allow the liberating light that shines from the
mountains of Mexico's southeast to be extinguished.
 
To do this, we ask that you make every effort to join us October 9-12,
in  Washington,  D.C. in this historic opportunity to stand  with  the
Zapatistas, and to let those in power know that reason and a  peaceful
transition to democracy must remain a viable alternative in Mexico.

The process, with its weird time delays and multiple branching almost every
line is certainly fascinating  -  perhaps particularly for contributors.
But then so are snapshots of that process. What I like about the 'ringa'
(as in ringa the changes) are its morphabilities.
 
And 'punblic somain' is my nomination for typo of the week btw.

I've now heard from Romana Huk, who is organising that conference at the

UK/Irish/US/Canadian poetry. She's asked me to say it'll take place on 28 Aug -
2 Sept 1996. Anyone interested in hearing more should contact her at UNH, Dept
of English, Durham, NH 03824, tel 603-862-3992. She has  some problem with her

Last week, as you may recall, David Ayre promised to post, what was it,
54(?) pages of rengas. Always a man of his word, in the last few days, Ayre
has done just that.
 
What I want to know is: how (& why) did he use so many different names and
email addresses to post this remarkable flurry of rengas?
 
& why has he dropped the convention of keeping the word "renga" in the
subject line for those (fools though they may be) who do not wish to read
more rengas?

If fewer posts were posted each day from each, then this would ease the
pay-per-line situation, and also alleviate the occasional clog
that the listserv owner has had to roto-root for us - talkin
about paying for the service! 50 different posters each day would
mix well in a punbliquity of unanimous outrage.
 
Of course it seems that explicit rules are anathema to the
implicit rules of this listserv that constitute it as it is, so
no doubt these suggestions as with every other are simulateously
asking you to not write past them and inviting you to do so with
everything you find at hand - the keyboard body. You've got a
keyboard body, it could be rad.

In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
And flew through windows  lightning green and fine morning
First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The caravan of windows to what they flee
These lace curtains, more gauze than bondage, more
Mollycoddled than aware, thin-spondee and pebbling
but narrow in the waist or waspish Sunday years ago
Over coffee topped with whipped lads, the Times blowing
& opining, heavy humid air, cum amusing against the
bleached ribcage ripcords into compassed wind

Flaubert because we're waiting all throughout
Eternity for moments to be of such sauciness.
In the nooks were creams and in the stream were hooks
All melded like striated film leftover in the pastel seeds

Of narration with partners of good moisture. Here,touch my

I had to go off for a few days and while I was gone the explanations
of who wrote the renga have thmselves taken on a renga-like
proliferation. As soon as I can sort out what I have been told I will
post what I have figured out so that people can make additional
claims or else ask not to be included.
 
I wonder who was the first person who brought a piece of kudzu from
Japan--just a random thought.
 
I do realize that the renga is an ongoing process and that anything
printed outside this list is reportage rather than publication. But
it might set an example that would help make so-called "workshops"
more fun. Despite its oriental model it seems to me a very new world
thing, like roof-raisings and potluck suppers.

Ha.  And what would that kind of reading be?  Yes, I have to agree with
Ed that HD is probably the most important of them--ep, hd, wcw--at the
moment, but wcw is (partially) important in american poetics (if I can
hazard such a generalization) because of his mainstreaming of an
avant-garde aesthetic.  Maybe the wheelbarrow is a little boring, but,
geez, it's neat isn't it?  I mean, I see Emerson and Thoreau in him . . .
and I always dig that.  As I suggested, though, I am interested in WCW
for not only the clarity and and simplicity, the laconic reduction of
language to its essentials, which still retains such resonance and
suggestive possibilities, but, also, because of his investment in an
avant-garde, modernist tradition.  HD and EP do not, I believe, offer
that same perspective.  I am interested in the WCW of Spring And All--the
prose/poem version, with its absurdity and weirdness.  Where else in the,
now, mainstream tradition do you find that?  Eliot doesn't count--expat
and all.  What is valuable is WCW--were we in need of qualifying this--is
that he, not single-handedly mind you, reoriented american poeticx:
"Writing is not a searching about in the daily experience for apt similes
and pretty thoughts and images.  I have experienced that to my sorrow.
It is not a conscious recording of the day's experiences "freshly and
with the appearance of realilty"--This sort of thing is seriously to the
development of any ability in a man, it fastens him down, makes him a--It
destroys, makes nature an accessory to the particular theory he is
following, it blinds him to the world . . . . "  I would hazard to say
that without WCW american poetics would have lacked an important
influence in turning itself away from an ideology of verisimilitude.  If
we are to read anyone we need to read them in a way that makes them not
only part of their context but as how t        relevant to our present.
Better WCW than longfellow....
