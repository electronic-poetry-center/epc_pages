This talk is boring. Not WCW. Very few poets have done anything to rival
Asphodel. (I mean besides David Ayre.) Much less the work in Imaginations.

Subject:      WCW and whose army
 
Our reading of the literature of the past is continuously refracted through the
prism of the present. But it's the necessary business - right in between the
sclerosis of the national heritage theme park, on the one hand, and the
instantaneous amnesia of MTV culture on the other.
 
WCW still feels like an outsider to me. I was told recently by someone brought
up in Paterson, NJ, that he was never taught Williams in English class, and
never heard about him until after he left school.

Subject:      Ranting on St Marks
 
For some time now I have wanted to buy a book by Zukofsky who I first heard
of on this list. A friend suggested St Marks as the best bookstore to find
him in. I called them up and was told they had a large selection. Fine I
said to myself, I'll go over there later tonight and spend some time
browsing.
 
I go to St Marks occasionally. Not enough to remember where everything is
located. However I found the poetry section and then I found the end of the
poetry section, where the X, Y's and Z's are. It runs into poetry
anthologies I believe. No Zukofsky from what I could see. So I asked the
grey-haired bearded man at the desk where I could find Zukofsky. "In the
poetry section," he growled. I tried again. Then I walked to the front of
the store to see if someone at the front desk could help me. No, it
appeared that guy was engaged in ringing up purchases.
 
So I said to myself fuck it, that guy should do his bloody job and help me.
I went to the desk again. I asked the bearded grouch in a polite voice if
he wouldn't mind checking his computer to see if any Zukofsky was in stock.
 
"Oh, for Christ sake," he said as he got violently up from his desk and
marched to the poetry section two feet away, "Just check the rack." Which
he did. Then he said, "We're out of stock." Which is what I thought but
wanted to be sure I hadn't missed anything. "When will you have him back in
stock?" I asked. "Not for a long time," he said.
 
At which point I had had enough, "When I called this afternoon I was told
you had all of Zukofsky on the shelves."
 
"We never carry all of Zukofsky," he said.
 
"Well!" I shrugged, threw up my hands and walked out in a silent rage.
 
On the way home I stopped in at the Barnes and Noble in my neighborhood and
picked up a copy of "A". No stress and no bad vibes. Simple, easy, polite.
 
Maybe the grey-haired bearded guy was having a hard day's night, I don't
know. But he put me off entirely. His attitude was rude, angry, ugly and
degrading.
 
Rather than compare St Marks to Barnes and Noble which is unfair because
they are in two different leagues, let me compare St Marks, with say, The
Gotham Book Mart. Now here is a bookstore that has never been anything but
polite, helpful and friendly to me. It is a bookstore I have used far more
than St Marks and will continue to do so. It has a literary history that
blows St Marks right off the map, with manners and sophistication to boot.
Never mind that things are slightly jumbled and out of order. Chalk it up
to charm.
 
By the way,from the little I read last night Zukofsky is engaging, and I am
sure that is the least of it.
 
A question. I believe Zukofsky wrote something about Shakespeare. A
critical essay or perhaps a book. Does anyone have the title and/or know
anything about it?
 
Take care
 
Blair

Louis Zukofsky's book "Bottom: On Shakespeare" was reissued by U of Cal
Press a few years ago, I think this edition is still in print.
 
This edition reissues only volume one of the original text. Volume two was
Celia Zukofsky's musical setting of Shakespeare's play "Pericles, Prince of
Tyre." LZ writes somewhere that CZ's rhythmic notation of Shakespeare's
text in this setting makes clear the ideas about Shakespeare he was writing
about. But then LZ also wrote that this dense and entertaining book could
be reduced to the logical formula <love is to reason as eyes are to mind>.
There's a lot more there, regardless of how relevant it is to these thesis.
 
In any case, even those of us who read music might quibble about the
discursive quality of CZ's music here. It isn't clear to me, at least, how
to get LZ's ideas about Shakespeare, Aristotle, Spinoza, & Wittgenstein
from CZ's use of, say, dotted quarter notes.
 
That said, CZ's music seems to be pretty. As far as I know the setting was
never performed.

Mark -- can I get xerox of your _Post_ post & Yardley excresence?  If you
don't have copies, give me dates so I can look up in library --
 
You may not recall ten years back when Yardley wrote a columnular whatsit
advocating the end of all poetry reviewing in the _Post_ (which never
amounted to much in any event)

too bad about St. Marks.  There was a period in the eighties when it was
just amazing: small stock, but nothing you didn't want to buy & read; lots
of stuff not available or not prominently displayed in much bigger bookstores.
 
MIght be worth one more try before writing off.  Actually I always found
Gotham kind of fustian and annoying....

In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
And flew through windows, lightning green and fine morning
First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The rook to the knight here by King's Bishop Three
Something has changed in the nature of friendship

For food stamps, quints racing about the linoleum
Everything leans on the verb, falling, sighs

Blair: you must mean the monumental _Bottom: on Shakespeare_. It
dribbled out in the Fifties. He wrote it from 1947 to 1960.

When I visited The Cloisters I asked the young woman behind the desk
why they didnt have copies of _Paterson V_ for sale. She said what
was that. I said a poem by William Carlos Williams, which causes
people such as myself, from the oppositer coast, to visit The
Cloisters. He's your great poet, I said. Never heard of him, she
said. She shda been working at St Mark's.

Subject:      Jonathan Yardley
 
When I first moved here, Jonathan Yardley was book-page editor for
what was then the Greensboro Daily News. He admitted repeatedly that
he simply could not read and did not understand poetry. In other
respects he was too intelligent and liberal-minded for some of his
readers.
 
Jon was especially enthusiastic about sports books. I once had a bad
dream in which he asked me to review a three volume autobiography of
Joe Garigiola, whose name I cannot spell, handing me a heavy volume
titled THE EARLY YEARS.
 
I am afraid that he has felt put down for years by refined literary
types and feels that poetry is almost pure pretense. I am afraid not
much can be done about it. When McDonald's serves quiche maybe
Yardley will like poetry.

An addendum to Herb Levy's information on Zukofsky's "Bottom: On Shakespeare":
The California edition he mentions was being offered by the Scholar's Book-
shelf, the mail-order remainder house, very cheap, last year, & it may still
be available from them.  (I bought one.)

Sad to say, but the only store here in Sacramento to carry any LZ is Barnes &

                EPHEMERA: anything short-lived or transitory
 
      The Ephemera Society of America is an organization committed
to the study of often-overlooked but culturally rich objects such
as lottery tickets, newspapers, trade cards, and travel literature
- to name but a few.  The annual symposiums of the society focus on
a main theme and include lecture sessions as well as activities
devoted to the study, discussion, and illumination of pieces of
ephemera as material culture.
      The society will hold its 1995 symposium in historical
Colonial Williamsburg, in Virginia, with the theme ``Job Printing
in America''.  Speakers from organization such as the American
Antiquarian Society, Library Company of Philadelphia, Yale
University, and Colonial Williamsburg will speak on topics ranging
from pre-1800 Virginia Ephemera, Benjamin Franklin's job printing,
chromolithography and the cigar label, and architectural vignettes
on commercial stationary.
      The event will feature a special torch-lit reception at
Colonial Williamsburg's eighteenth-century Printing Office by the
tradesmen who have dedicated their lives to the accurate recreation
of the book arts trades of colonial America. A demonstration of
papermaking, hand-press operation, bookbinding and gold tooling,
and the production of decorative papers will be held and symposium
attendees will have the opportunity to try some of these activities
first hand.
 
           ***** URGENT: Please respond by September 19th!!  *****
 
      Registration fee: $150 ($250 for couples).  This includes a
year-long pass to all of Colonial Williamsburg's many museums,
programs, and demonstrations, six formal lectures, tours of the CW
library and other historic sites of interest, and a banquet dinner
at the Williamsburg Woodlands hotel.

Yes Tom, I guess it is good to have a bookstore who has heard of Zukofsky.
 
It's also fine to be part of a list that discusses him. And I thank Herb
Levy for his most informative post.
 
I wonder how many other bookstores in New York carry Zukofsky? We know
Barnes & Noble does.
 
Perhaps if I had worded my inquiry at St Marks something along the lines,
"I called this afternoon and was told you had a selection of Zukofsky in
stock, but I can't seem to find him in the poetry section under Z," the
whole incident would have proceeded rather differently.

Bookstores are just as chickenshit as commercial radio stations, that's
what.  They won't carry anything unless someone can guarantee them X amount
of sales, and they won't take any chances without that guarantee.  Poetry,
of all types but always especially that poetry considered "avant-garde" or
"experimental",  has proven remarkably ineffective as a consumer good, since
you can't just consume it and move on (you have to live and grow with it),
so it doesn't fit well into the marketing schema.  Look for this trend to
get worse over the next few years, as wealth further concentrates in the
hands of fewer and fewer and bigger and bigger corporations.
 
btw, I got my Joris Celan translation at City Lights, but even that store
doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be.

I appreciate the interest several of you have taken on the list, or
backchannel, on my letter rebutting Jonathan Yardley. Regarding Jorge's
request to post the letter, the letter itself does not provide that much
information that an audience like this on the poetics list needs--the
points it makes would be for you all pretty much obvious.
 
I will say this: Yardley's argument is threefold; there are no good
writers of literature in the U.S. right now. This is true because writers
have no interest in audiences. They have no interest in audiences because
their large academic salaries and huge arts subsidies make them
self-indulgent.
 
It is, of course, an argument typical of the desire to undermine arts
funding here in D.C.
 
The last paragraph of my letter reads as follows:
 
        The problem with Yardley is that he ignores literary culture on
the one hand and attacks it on the other. He is thus a perfect example of
the isolated, institutionalized writer he pretends to disdain,
responsible to a paycheck that comes not from any audience but from a
powerful media conglomerate. He is a critic who attacks what he doesn't
understand.
 
Thanks again to Carolyn, Jorge and others for their interest.

St. Marks used to be better than it is. Gotham's more than a bit
hostile to L. poetry, except as it relates to Black Mountain, etc.
schools (seems to me).
 
But on the plus side, the Upper West Side Shakespeare & Co. actually
had (has?) the Joris Celan *on display*!
 
And on a trip to Philadelphia a couple of days ago, Borders had: two
Coolidge, three Hejinian (I picked up THE CELL, which I find perfect),
one each of Raworth, Perelman, S. Howe, R. Waldrop, Jabes, etc.
Admittedly all Sun & Moon (but for the Perelman?), but still very
nice. Although their journal selection's gone down, whereas the Upper
West Side Papyrus had not only DENVER QUARTERLY & NEW AMERICAN
WRITING but also LINGO & the Watten issue of AERIAL.
 
So while it could be better, it seems to me, it could also be a LOT
worse ...

while the music chatter which has been on the list has generally

After seeing Baryshnikov's *White Oak Dance Project* the other night
i'm desperate to know if one would consider Pergolesi to be Baroque.
i suppose it depends on how you define Baroque.
Deleuze calls Baroque music "what can extract harmony from melody"
but having taken drama class over music class in my early
years, this is lost on me.

hadn't known about Yardley's previous incarnation yet farther south -- in
recent years he has sprouted an esitional, editorial column in addition
to his book review page -- and both are increasingly given to neocon
drivel of the most uninformed sort -- it's particularly depressing to
find a long-time book pager so freqently making negative remarks about
books he has not read --  It's one thing to profess an inability to "get"
a particular genre (as I, for example, just don't get grunge -- find it,
in fact, not that grungy) -- another thing to, as Yardley did (and David
McAleavey did write a letter to the editor which was actually published
explaining just what was found wanting in Mr, Y's logic at the time!) use
such powers as a page columnist has to promote the idea that "nobody"
knows what's good  in poetry anymore (sound familiar? a bit corny,
prehaps?) and that we'd all be better off just ignoring the stuff --
"esitional"?? try additional--
 
This was shortly after the LA Times had abandoned poetry reviewing, but
they did begin to publish a poem in each week's book review, and have
now, with no mention of their curious earlier editorial position,
returned to the reviewing of verse --
 
My one and only experience reviewing poetry for the _WAsh Post__ wasn't
encouraging -- they asked me to review books by Dove and Bronk -- which I
did -- they then typoed a line in the Dove review so that instead of her
line mentioning "gum popping" girls it read "gun popping" -- despite the
fact that they had changed my correct copy, the POST printed no
correction -- can't help wondering if the proof-reading gnomes at the
POST would have let such an error through if the line had made reference
to young white girls -- maybe I'm paranoid, but my old colleague Sterling
Brown used to tell his students "any black man who isn't paranoid is crazy!"
 
I have ever since dreaded meeting Ms. Dove for fear she will remember
this and think it my mistake --
 
Yardley loves the work of Peter Taylor, with reason, and despises the
likes of Don DeLillo, Joseph McElroy, etc. -- seems there is much he
can't read --
 
I hereby volunteer to write a weekly review for the _Washington Post_ at
half Yardley's salary --

I know of two recordings of Zukofsky that are commercially available,
Hank. One is a video recording, from the NET Outtake series from _USA:
Poetry_, produced by KQED in San Francisco 1965-66. It includes parts of
"A"-9, a section from "Catullus," a discussion of James Joyce, Whitman,
Pound and Bunting; I've seen it -- shown it at the Western Front here in
Vancouver -- it's wonderful; it's a half hour on 3/4" video, available
from The American Poetry Archives, The Poetry Center, San Francisco State
University, 1600 Holloway Ave., San Francisco CA 94132, tel (415)
338-1056. The tape is available for sale at $125 plus shipping & tax; or
for rent at $15 per public showing + shipping & tax.
 
There's also an audio tape from Spoken Arts, Inc., in the "Spoken Arts
Treasury of American Jewish Poets Reading Their Poems." The tape with
Zukofsky on it is Volume II, and also features Lenore Marshall, Stanley
Kunitz, Hy Sobiloff, and Karl Shapiro. Zukofsky reads "A"-12, "Spooks
Sabbath," "Songs of Degree," "Nor Did the Prophet," "As to How Much," "An
Incident," "The Record," "Song 22," and "Mantis." Write to Spoken Arts,
Inc., Box 289, New Rochelle, NY 10801. I don't know how much, but it's a
cassette tape; I doubt it's much.
 
Herb, a Vancouver group called the Cassation Group did some performances
of "A"-24 in the late eighties both here at SFU and at the Western Front.
So far as I know, it wasn't recorded at SFU unless the group did it
themselves; but may have been recorded at the Front; I'll try to check.
 
Ron, didn't a group including Barrett Watten do a performance in SF?
 
Best,
 
Charles Watts

I still dont get Foster's point. Why is WCW dissed as boring because
he lived in an earlier time? Like, when do we cut poets off our
reading list? When trolley cars were no longer? 30 years after the
poet's death? Does a middling poet get points up because she can fog

updating Williams's poems now. I have him driving a 1989 Toyota

Dear Tenney:
 
I may rant about St Marks Bookshop but it in no way means I will not
return, even though it may be some months before I do so. If, for instance,
I wanted a book by Bernadette Mayer, St Marks would be the first place I
would check, which may be a mark of my ignorance, I don't know.
 
That said, if I had been treated with a little more civility, I may have
stayed around, checked out, and possibly purchased other books in the
store, which would have benefited St Marks, the authors they carry, and me.
 
I should also mention that when St Marks was located around the corner, in
their old location, it felt better to be there. I congratulate them on
there expansion, but frankly, the new store doesn't grab me the way the old
one did.
 
Today I ordered "Bottom: on Shakespeare" from Gotham. They were quick on
the uptake, and I don't much feel like changing my position on them, but I
will say they did seem to rush me through my order. Maybe I had your
comment in mind.

Let's see just how bad my memory is. Bob Perelman, I believe, produced
a series of performances of "A"-24 in 1978. Steve Benson and Carla
Harryman also participated. My visual memory tells me that one
performance was at the Grand Piano, the coffee house series I ran with
Tom Mandel, but others I believe were done at SF State and UC Davis. I
recall being struck that the performances were more inspired than the
score (but the theatrical in LZ--and CZ--has never been my meat:
"Rudens" strikes me as the weakest section of "A").
 
One thing worth noting: the use of Handel made it impossible to perform
the text "naturally" (it goes too slowly to be spoken), which brought
forward the constructed nature of the language.
 
It was, as they say, a revelation.

Herb,
 
A-24 was first performed, I believe, by Harryman, Watten, Hejinian and Kit
Robinson in the early 80s.  I used to have a tape of it which I walk-personed
every day and night to learn the part of drama by heart.  I believe Brad
Westbrook, the curator at the UCSD archive for new poetry, got me the tape.
 Also, the SF State archive probably has a copy, as do the performing poets.
 
 
Anyway, he and I and two other folks (Becky Roberts & Chuck Cody) then
performed A-24, once to a piano at the Pannikin in Del Mar and once to a
harpsicard at Mandible Hall on campus, a few years after the high L-folks.
 Again, Brad is probably the best source of a recording of those pieces, as I
appear to have lost my copies . . .

SF State has both audio and visual recordings. The visual ones are from
Dick Moore's Poetry USA series. It was via this PBS series that I first
heard of Zukofsky, was blown away (totally!) by him and rushed out to
buy anything I could find at Cody's--which proved only to be the Robert
Kelly/Paris Leary anthology (a pretty great book after all these
years!), which in turn led to my first reading of Mac Low and a serious
rethinking of Spicer (with a far better selection than in the Allen)
and O'Hara's Biotherm in the smallest font size ever.

Subject:      Distribution or Bust
 
One of the few rules on Poetics@UBVM is that participants (lurkers and not)
are requested to post news of their recent publications, together with
information on how best to get these items.  It has come to my attention that
some of you are out-of-compliance with this "don't balk/must tell" rule.  The
fuller the listings (table of contents, etc) the better.  If you are a
publisher and editor and have new material on the EPC, it is still useful to
post it on Poetics as well, since many of the subscribers either don't have
Web access, don't use it, or don't check new listings.  This is may also be a
way to compensate for the recurring distribution and bookstore problems
discussed here.
 
On Bookstores:  Problem with the New York bookstores discussed here is that
even if they carry a new poetry book they rarely re-order, or re-order so
erratically that you can never count on finding a book, even a recent book, in
stock.  This is why the sales rep system is so crucial, since the initial
order of a new book is ultimately the one that will determine if the book gets
any bookstore life in New York at all.  So if you don't find a book, it's
possible that it was ordered and sold out; the books in stock are often the
ones that didn't sell.  In the 70s and 80s, when I used to pester these stores
to carry specific books and magazines, I always felt getting shelf space was
like getting a gallery show; "naturally" places like Gotham and Books & Co.
felt having the books in the store was enough, they certainly didn't have to
pay you for what they sold too!  (In my experience, St. Mark's always paid.
But they were the exception.)  At the same time, the real estate costs in New
York are so high that it is _probably_ not possible to survive with the sort
of commitments to poetry many of us look for in a bookstore; I say probably
because people do manage to figure out how to do improbable things, as any
number of our alternative poetry institutions show.
 
I don't buy books in New York, preferring to buy direct from the publishers,
or from SPD, but most often from Talking Leaves Books (which in turn buys them
from SPD).  Talking Leaves remains my favorite poetry bookshop and I have been
talking with the coop owners there about working directly with the Poetics
list and EPC: setting up accounts, taking order via e-mail, and so on.  So you
should be hearing more about that soon (though as they are understaffed and
have limited access to computer technology that this is taking longer than
they would like). (In the meantime, they are happy to take orders by phone or
mail: 3158 Main Street, Buffalo, NY 14214; 716-837-8554; fax--837-3861.)  As
has been noted by others on this list and off, bookstores like Talking Leaves
and Woodland Pattern are always in danger and need the same sort of support we
give to small presses and SPD and indeed other poets: we are all in it
together.
 
The Internet and the Web are becoming increasingly central for poetry
distribution, even if as yet many of the readers of the books often discussed
on this list are not on-line.  At this point, I see one of the primary values
of the EPC and the Poetics List as facilitating the distribution of print
books and magazines rather than (not as opposed to) making work available
electronically.  I see many parallels with the work I did on Segue's
distribution catalog in the 70s and 80s and the work on the EPC now.  We can't
afford to have the Net "replacing" bookstores, publishers and distributors
that support new and "alternative" poetry: that would be a net loss, indeed.
We have to find way to use the Net to help these institutions survive.  To
this end, listings and short reviews/discussions on Poetics of new work become
a mode of distribution.
 
About 15 years ago my continually new friend Cris Cheek prepared, on his
manual typewriter, an extensive list of UK small press publications, carefully
annotated with prices and address, issued as supplement #2 of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.
I'm reminded of that because the EPC and this list seem such a good place for
the sort of exchange of information and ideas among the UK, US, New Zealand,
Canada, and Australia.  And while we talk about the lack of information
between N. American poets and U.K. poets, it's been my sense that at least in
the particular world represented by those of us "here" that, in a small way,
this is beginning to take care of itself just as we talk about it.

Collected Shorter, A, & L.Z.: Man & Poet. Borders buys in bulk, they made a
decision to sell SUN & MOON, not any of their authors. It's a question of one
person, in this case me, giving a damn & showing, over time, that poetry will
be supported when made available. The reason St Mark's isn't what they were
is they lost their small press buyer in '88. I'd still go there over Borders
or B.&N. no matter how grouchy the guy in the back is-- & I'm pretty sure
I've encountered him, similar vibe to the bartender at the Ear.
But are you REALLY a New Yorker if you're not creatively rude on a fairly
regular basis.  Back to business-- I think it's increasingly clear the
corporations are winning-- we'll all be making $4.26 an hour soon enough.
 
Have to disagree w/ David M. about Yardley, he wrote:

Of course you're right that they know he'll make some mainstream readers of
fiction/poetry mad, but I can't imagine them hiring say, Angela Davis, or
A.L. Nielsen for that matter, to write on literature just because they'd "get
attention."

Hank -- if you go for the _Treasury of American Jewish Poets_ get the whole
set --
it also includes Stein and Reznikoff on other tapes in the set -- well
worth having to listen to the likes of Hy Sobiloff to get to these!  The
set was originally distributed by Spoken Arts Inc. -- but is also
available through other distribution agencies -- also worth your while is
the Watershed Oppen tape, circa 1979 -- some univ. libraries have these
tapes -- so look close to home before buying --

well, you may recall that the tracks were all ripped up by the tire

major cities everywhere are re-introducing the trolley -- just when you

Subject:      Dangerous poets?
 
    In the 9/18 _New Yorker_ David Remnick asks (re: Ben
Bradlee) "Who is interested in a 'dangerous' editor?"
Dangerous here refers to not fitting in with the blandness
and sameness of co-opted commercial media.  While
I do have my own thoughts on this, I would be interested
in thoughts on:
 
What is a "dangerous" poet?
 
Who is the last one we've had?
 
Has that person had an effect on the way we live (or don't live)?
 
 
Possibly also of some interest in re: _Post_ ?review?

I wonder who else has picked this up while I lay sleeping...
 
Pergolesi (1710-36) certainly lived at the time of "high baroque"
composition, and yes, he outlined chordal (harmonic) structures in his
melodies - but who doesn't? It's damned difficult not to. I'd say that the
way he stripped down the counterpoint (one of the defininging elements of,
say, Bach Handel or Scarlatti) to a bare minimum, and supported his tunes
with almost Phil Spector block harmony, places him closer to the early
classical composers.
 
Who in fact rated him very highly, years after his death. People tell me
that the claims made for his "Stabat Mater" are extravagant: but to hell
with them - there's a brooding, melodramatic religious depth in it which
I'm a sucker for, and which you don't get again until Mozart's big c minor
mass (also driven by Italian opera) at the end of the eighteenth century.
 
Of course, there's a lot of other stuff which doesn't fit that pattern -
early work (! in a very short career) and chamber music which are far more
run-of-the-mill. I seem to recall there are some concerti grossi which
have just been ascribed to him which Vivaldi would've killed for...

Borders and B&N are sucking the life out of the other bookstores here in
chicago.  In the last month, I think three independent stores and one chain
(Crock's & Bretano's) have gone under.
 
For almost anything I want, I go to 57th St. books and the Seminary Co-op.
Their selection of poetry isn't always the greatest, or evenly distributed
(two weeks ago I saw a shelf that had about ten different titles by for too
and about Ginsberg, one title by Ferlingetti), but they are always helpful
and have never taken more than nine days to deliver something I've ordered.

Good question, but probably not very relevant in the U.S., where writers
don't pose a real political or social threat the way they do in some other
countries. Poets here are dangerous only to other poets.

Subject:      Distribution 'R' Us
 
Two short thoughts on distribution:
 
Even in a city without a store like Woodland Pattern, Talking Leaves,
Bridge Street, it still makes sense to find an independent local store and
order through them.
 
Any small book store needs the business, even if they don't specialize in
poetry. &, eventually, they will start to be more adventurous. Last week
when I went to order the Joris/Rothenberg anthology I was told "Oh, I
thought you'd want that when I saw it from the rep - I ordered a couple for
stock too." Granted they'll never have the depth or breadth of a specialty
shop, but they've learned that they can sell some things they didn't know
about before, & that's the only way independent book stores can stay in
business these days. & it beats going from Borders to Tower to Barnes &
Noble, trying to second-guess this week's corporate policies any day.
 
Another thing that can increase the distribution of "this kind of" poetry
is to make purchase requests at libraries.
 
They won't buy everything (& the selections can seem frustratingly
arbitrary), but library buyers are overwhelmed with options & frequently
just need an excuse to make a choice. If few people are requesting books
(&, even at academic libraries, most people don't), you could make a real
mark on a library's poetry collection. The University of Washington, where
I just have an alumni borrowers card buys two-thirds to three-quarters of
what I request, even though there's rarely any courses that deal with any
of it. If everyone on this list did this, it'd increase sales by a
significant number of copies & make the work available to lots more people
without costing anyone "here" anything but a little extra time once a month
or so.

i was referring to the passage quoted from wcw and suggesting that if you unpack it you find that it eliminates or questions ways of speaking--gnostic utterance for one. no? which irritates. a little too unitarian (?), or clarity thru elimination.

specifically, burt: we are told the passage comes from wcw: ok, in that case, we have to ask, now, why "nature" [whatever that meant, then] should not be "an accessory to a particular theory," why not be "blind" to what wcw called "the world"?

Herb,
As Ron & Bill say, A24 was performed at the Grand Piano
coffee house in SF, at SF State for the Poetry Center, and
at UC Davis in a small recording studio. I don't know if the
Grand Piano gig was taped. The SF State performance was
videotaped, but the best performance & recording was done
at UC Davis. The cast:
 
Bob Perelman - piano
Barrett Watten - poem
Lyn Hejinian - story
Carla Harryman & Steve Benson - play
Kit Robinson - essay
 
I wonder if the American Poetry Archive has a copy of the
UC Davis tape. Laura?

in fact there is another Louis Zukofsky videotape kicking about and it is
located in the Milton Eisenhower library at Johns Hopkins University.
Hugh Kenner I believe had invited Zukofsky to read and here is the record
of him reading, I believe A-22 and -23... as a video, regretably, it's
not so good -- i.e., very wide shots and a table lamp w/ shade infront of
the camera... but as a document, it's good and the audio quality is also
good... i don't know anything about the availability but it's there...

Re: Distribution or Bust
 
Thanks Charles for reminding us lurkers that we need, at least, to keep the
basic information flowing.
 
Five Fingers Review 14, "Metamorphosis," is now available. The issue was
inspired by and is dedicated to the memory of Nina Iskrenko. Belated thanks
go out to Ron Silliman, Ed Foster and others for their postings just after
Nina died. She was a contributing editor for FFR and a dear friend as well.
No 14 includes a collaborative project Nina directed just before she died,
called the the Metamorphosis Project, in which she distributed a short
excerpt from Plato's Laws with "all the nouns lovingly crossed out" to a
group of Russain and American writers asking them to fill in the blanks.
The Russian contributors are: Nina, Sveta Litvak, Nikolai Baitov, Igor
Zhukov, Sergei Solovyev, Pavel Mityushev, Dmitry Vodennikov and Andrei
Vorkunov. The American: John High, Leslie Scalapino, Thoreau Lovell,
Michelle Murphy and Scott MacLeod.
 
The issue also features special sections by other contributing editors:
Writing from the UK edited by Fanny Howe, with work by Ken Edwards, David
Dibosa, Wendy Mulford and Drew Milne. A section of Native American / Mixed
Blood writing edited by Mark Nowak, featuring Diane Glancy, Kimberly
TallBear and Eric Priestley. C. D. Wright and Forrest Gander introduce
writing by two younger writers, J. L. Jacobs and Mallory Tarses
respectively. Rounding out the issue is a section of new poems by Ivan
Zhdanov translated by John High and an interview with Zhdanov conducted by
John High.
 
Other contributors are: Jon Davis, Sally Doyle, Evgeny Laputin trans.
Vitaly Chernetsky, H. E. Francis, Craig Czury, John Olson, Gordon Lish,
Mark Mirsky, Ezra Mark, Elizabeth Robinson, David Hoefer, Larry Fondation,
Lawrence Fixel, Stephen Ratcliffe, Annabelle Honza Clippinger, Stefanie
Marlis, Robert Fagan, Andrew Joron, Ray DiPalma, and Liz Waldner.

Subject:      LZ & bookshop chickenshit
 
"Bookstores are just as chickenshit as commercial radio stations."
 
Dear Steve (and all with bookstore complaints),
 
Here's a slightly crabby response from someone who worked the front lines
of
chickenshit-- having owned and run a bookstore for six years. I agree that
it is
irritating to rarely find one's literary tastes represented on bookstore
shelves. I agree that the situation is getting worse as time goes by. But
the
reason is not that bookbuyers are more disinterested in avant garde
concerns,
but that it is becoming a increasingly large risk, in our deflated
economies, to
maintain a stock that adequately represents even the major movements in
contemporary poetry and poetics, let alone off shoots, "minor" writers,
etc.
Booksellers are not plotting together to keep experimental writing out of
the
marketplace. They are stuggling under extremely anxious conditions to keep
their
businesses open. As Charles pointed out, overhead gets more and more
impossible
in the urban areas which have any sort of concentrated readership of such
books.
If a store does seem to have even a rudimentary stock of books you like, it
probably means that the shop is kept open by free labour, outside jobs on
the
owner's part, and almost definately some sort of martyred partner with a
banal
day job, who keeps the rent paid at home, and the fridge stocked. You can
imagine the burn-out rate of such a life. The point is, why trash even
small
efforts towards adventurous ordering? Why not patiently place special
orders for
Zukofsky, Ferguson, Bernstein, Doris, Celan, then make sure you actually(
and
promptly)  buy the book when it arrives? Why not inform your bookseller
about
reading communities who would happily buy sun and moon books, roof books,
tsunami books? Then make sure these people respect the economic outlay a
broke
bookseller is making, make sure money changes hands. Why not make group
orders
via your informal reading groups? If you teach, why not order through
independant shops?  If you are a tenured person with an income, why not buy
from
a shop instead of waiting for a complimentary copy to arrive in the mail?
Bookstores finally have to either close, or change their stocking policies
and
philosophies, for complex reasons. Many customers regard a shop that stocks
language poetry, black mountain, tish, objectivists, more like a museum or
a
community service, than a shakey business that desperately needs economic
patonage. Booksellers are often so worn out fielding calls from collections
departments that they can't spend alot of time teaching themselves about
poetry
movements. Its up to the customer who wants a good booksource to teach the
bookseller, help her build a relationship with alternative buying
communities.
The rent which shelters these formidable tomes you favour must be paid, the
space must be insured, the phone kept operative, even if the bookseller
herself
does live on someone else's generosity. Most bookstores are very happy to
special order, and if you multiply these orders, by ordering with friends,
then
the buyer starts to get the point. Here I am begining to repeat my theme, I
know, but in that business haughty individuals who deplore the absence of
their
personal canons are the (irritating) norm. Often the clerk you speak with
is not
the buyer, is someone working for minimum wage, or volunteering, and can't
be a
specialist in your area. Often the bookseller is too embarrassed to tell
you
that the book you have ordered is in limbo because an account has been
frozen or
terminated due to inability to pay. Under long term duress, the protocols
of
concerned and attentive customer service can occaisionally wear thin. Only
a
committed and patient community can keep a good shop open.
 
On that note I would suggest that all Vancouver list subscribers rush to
Black
Sheep Books on fourth avenue, and help Denise and Trent by buying
something, and
by ordering something. I understand that multiple copies of Perelman's
Trouble
with Genius will be arriving there shortly.
 
respectfully,
Lisa Robertson

Subject:      Re: Pergolesi
 
It's a kind of a bad teminology joke.  Baroque in painting sculpture
architecture town planning means a variable time/period-thing that's
hottest in the 17th century, but still going in some versions in the
early 18th in Germany and Austria. But music: that's altogether a
different terminology and even Mozart in the late 18th century is
sometimes called baroque (rarely & I suppose carelessly)though I must
say. Bach and even more obviously Handel coincide with what in
European decorative asrts painting architecture etc is usually called
Rococo. Forget the big old period terminology and its attempts to
find a few simple style characteristics to fit everyone into a time.
        French literature Baroque is late 16th century to early 17th
century and ends with the Precieux, maybe the death of Voiture 1648 wd
be a good date. The whole enterprise is deeply suspect. Personally
I'm more interested in way pomo readings of  much late 16th c and
early 17th c arts can be useful (which I refuse to say any more about, because
it's the same old game once more other than in a three volume
encyclopaedic book).
 
        The Baroque as a term is about as useful as G1 when it comes
down to the reading/understanding/enjoyment or even on the critical
commentary on any actual works.
 
        Go Pergolesi, with your somewhere between Baroque and Rococo
even early classical-romantic harmony-melody!

Maybe USAmerican poets arent dangerous, but their novelists can be,
to their wives. Take Mailer and Burroughs, for instance.
 
And some of us know of a USAmerican poet who shot his wife.

Thanks, Herb, for pointing this out. It is too easy to be cynical about
bookstores, yet so true that at least some of them can be influenced by us
when we actually buy books. I imagine there are several people on this list
who buy $500 or more (for some, a lot more) of books each year. To a
bookstore, that makes you significant, particularly when you figure it's
only a small percentage of Americans who ever set foot in a bookstore.

I even know of one case at a university where, during a rash of spending
cuts lasting quite some time, librarians could only order books which
faculty members had requested. Several librarians I've known have been
outstanding builders of poetry collections (far better than most literature
professors). I trust them with the decisions more than I trust the faculty,
for the most part.
 
Thanks for saying these various things, Herb.

I'm not sure why I'm pursuing this . . . I thought we trashed over WCW
months ago?  Anyway, the passage--if it's the one I posted--does seek to
question a way of speaking; specifically, a poetry that emulates the
real.  WCW was after the shape of the imagination--as vague, mind you, as
Nature, but specifically attempting to free poetry from the constraints
of an inherited romantic tradition binding verse to the depiction of a
natural world.  WcW (wCw; W2C?) was . . . questioning the validity of
this way of writing. And, again,(especially if we are to pursue this any
further) I ask: where would we be without this influence?

In uk universities book-buying budgets are so tight that it's not uncommon
for all library selection to be delegated to faculty. The result, in my
experience, is that collections are always lagging behind current academic
interest because they are reacting to demand, rather than understanding it
and preempting it. Also, collections fragment as each individual pursues
his/her own concerns, and the "linkage" areas fall by the wayside.
Smallpress buying, it goes without saying, also falls away.
 
Having a librarian involved in selection doesn't fix the basic problem
(lack of resource) but it should mean that selection has a broader base,
and can react to wider interests (as long as these are expressed, and
don't remain at the sudued muttering stage). Gently, I'm starting to
squeeze a little more smallpress material into Durham...

Well, I have to fess up. I just received 9 boxes of my new book _Ruin_.
But if my silence on the publication of this book weren't egregious enough
quietude, I am also the publisher.  - what books -  is the name of my
press.
 
Upcoming from what books is a book by Thad Ziolkowski titled _Our Son the
Arson_, due sometime at the end of the year. I hope in the next year to
publish one or two other collections and a recalcitrant anthology I've been
working on for a while. I aim to publish two or three books a year by
writers who are just outside the loop. what books is not an effort to bring
writers into the loop-as-such, but to see if there can remain for at least
a while a notion complicit autonomy. There is a big cusp.
 
As to my book, I have had luck doing the consignment hustle in NYC - St.
Marks had one copy last I heard (two were purchased there by friends) and
Tower's consignment buyer wants more. That's pretty much the extent of my
distribution to date. Now I have 750 copies...
 
If anyone would like a copy  (or copies for thier book store shelves) you
can reach me here, preferably back-channel, or at PRPhillips@aol.com. I
would be glad to send you one. I know that some of you are strapped for
cash (or couldn't bear the sight unseeness of it,)  I will be giving away
some copies, so if you would like a copy (for barter, trade, or donation
and postage), please send me your mailing address and I'll gladly send you
one.
 
I would also be very glad to hear anyone's comments on SPD and "other"
distribution methods. I would also like to know people have luck hoofing
into other stores in the Boston/NY/Philly/DC area with thier books, or
which stores are particularly open.  Julianna, or Rod, do either of you
have small press info? Lisa Robertson, what is your view of the viability
of quite small "indi's" in the small press slump?

This is probably the concomitant danger of the attempt to poetize trivia, to
champion "simple everyday speech."  Certainly when WCW's effort fails, the
trivia stays trivial and the poetry joins it.  But honestly, Ed, are there
no moments in WCW when something trivial achieves a shining presence through
Williams' treatment of it?

Thank you, Lisa, for a little breath of un-self-centered air in this
discussion.  As co-owner of one of the world's smallest bookstores, I can
corroborate the sad truth that invoices must be paid whether the books on
them have sold or not.  And the effort to balance what will sell with
what I wish would sell, what I'd like to be surrounded with, is in itself
a career.  When a customer asks for a book I don't have--or a whole
category of books I don't have--I always respond by offering to place
an order.  Usually the disgruntled one can't be bothered.
 
And one more thing--bookstore owners have venues of our own, where we talk
about our customers the way you are talking about us.  That's the reason
there aren't more assaults in bookstores.

Chickenshit? Oh, I thought it said "chickenship" & read it through twice
looking for an anecdote about Spicer in a vancouver bookshop.
 
Even so, I want to reiterate Lisa's suggestion that Vancouver folks support
Black Sheep Books. They did a great job of stocking their tables at
BlaserCon.
 
I only wish I was in Vancouver more often to spend more money at such a
responsive shop. Maybe when I'm up there to hear Derek Bailey & company.
 
&, thanks to everyone for the information on various Zukofsky video/audio
tapes.

I hope you are able to find a Canadian publisher for "Shoot" eventually,
but at least you were able to get it published somewhere.

last truly dangerous poet I met was a drunk at the Red Lion who used to
leave threatening messages on my answering machine -- since moving West I
haven't encountered another --
 
BUT, in the sens in which the question was offered --
 
commercial publishing and its yardley appendages have done a good job of
convincing everyone that American poets are clawless (perhaps even
clueless), merely pawing over one another --
 
there is, however, always a however,
 
most of us in fact know of one or two people who aren't publishing poets
who occasionally read poetry
 
whether any poets are truly dangerous or not, the US Govt. seems to worry
about some of them -- check out Baraka's FBI files and you'll be
surprised how many of his chapbooks were purchased by Hoover's literati
for closer examination
 
the MFA establishment, whoever and wherever that might be, certainly goes
into a tither the moment anyone suggests hiring a poet unlikely to get on
TV with Bill Moyers and loosing same upon the creative writing students
-- I've observed this phenom. at several colleges in recent years -- &
read the AWP newletter if you think Yardley is the most outrageous and
paranoid of our denouncers of poetics these days --
 
The reactions of both FBA and MFA agents are, naturally, out of all
proportion to real threat --
 
I think Bersenbrugge endangered a number of my own assumptions about line
-- and I have been trying to understand what that means ever since --
 
rereading Russell Atkins was a clear and present danger to much that I
had been taught about postmodernity, and I'm still mulling that over
 
No novel is safe in the vicinity of Lyn Hejinian or Leslie Scalapino
 
And Williams is still, I believe, more dangerous than the "light rail"
now installed in San Jose, which has claimed fifteen lives during its
short existence.
 
I don't think H.D. represents a clear and present danger (though I love
her, the novels especially) -- but Moore's scalpel is deadly if you let
her get close --
 
Have any poets changed my own carriage?
 
To this day I will not read Niedecker in a dark room by myself --

I've back-channeled a few people about both Zukovsky and the A-24 tape,
but was hesitant to post to the list as it would be difficult to respond
to many requests for the tapes all at once. The Poetry Center and American
Poetry Archives here at SF State taped the performance of A-24 that was
done here. The date I have for it is 11/15/78. I don't believe I have
releases from all of the performers (everyone's list of them was
accurate) to sell the tape, so it is distributed only as a library tape for the price of membership ($20) in The Poetry
Center. We also have the outtakes from the NET series Poetry: USA,
including the Zukovsky program. It is 30 minutes, a very interesting tape, which
sells, as Charles Watts indicated (thanks, Charles) for $125 and can be
rented for $15. I can be reached here by email or by phone (415)338-1056 Moday -Thursday.

Hi Kit, I wonder if there's anything else you can add to the discussion re-
A24 in performance. How did it work? What felt awkward, if anything, in the
tension between the music notation and the language notation? Would you
recommend that it's worth working on a performance of A24 - with
performance-writing students say? Any titbits of process, discussion that
spring to mind? Am I right in remembering that this production followed on
from several Poets Theatre performances, how did it feel to be working on
something that was not written by people directly in that 'group' of
writers and performers?
 
simply lots of questions  -  I'm curious to know more
love and love

where would we be? again: look at rimbaud, where wcw visited; it was there. but you'll find similarly, if differently phrased, positions in (oddly, given wcw's rejection) keats, moving poetry away from the ego (and representation, too). no?

as for "where would we be without . . . ," that's not the issue. it's whether we need a shift out of that tradition, put it in mothballs for a while (or that classroom, same thing).

yes, steve, there are moments when "something trivial achieves a shining presence," but it's still a way of seeing and a language that doesn't compel as much anymore. and curiously, moore does those transformations much better. dickinson, too.

Subject:      Re: LZ & bookshop chickenshit
 
Dear Lisa:
 
Thanks for the added perspective.  I thought that I was saying about
bookbuyers basically what you say about them, albeit from my own crabby
armchair.  What I meant by "chickenshit" was, in fact, more directed toward
the chain bookstores (and I don't think there's an anti-experimental or
-small press conspiracy there either), who don't want to be bothered with
patchwork distribution and return policies, smaller orders (it's easier for
them to order in bulk than 1 or 2 copies at a time), and so on.  I certainly
understand for smaller bookstores that there's a real (and legitimate)
anxiety about taking chances with their shelf space, and the suggestions you
and Herb Levy have outlined are excellent ones that I feel really stupid
about not going the extra step to mention before I posted.
 
It was not my intention to trash anyone for not stocking my taste in poetry,
and I used to work in (several) record stores, so I have been on the other
side of the counter and know what that's like too.
 We in S.F. have all but lost Small Press Traffic (it's relegated to 4 or 5
shelves in another bookstore at Noe and Market, a storage space in Colma,
and Dodie's reading series), and so we may have to learn this lesson the
hard way.

I'm not sure I can agree that WcW fails.  In fact, as my posts have
suggested, he is important because he succeeded so well at turning poetry
to the everyday.  If the everyday is trivial, well, then I too wish we
could live in the poems we all dream.  The everyday is not trivial and is
worthy of poetry.

ed, et al: I toofind WCW boring. But it may be that I do because he is so
easily imitated. So, I sometimes find O'Hara, Ginsburg, Hejinian, boring for
the same reasons.
     Was it Picasso who said, very very roughly, "The most original art is
ugly. Then someone comes along and makes it pretty." I don't know
but can the term, or the concept, "boring" apply in the same way?

but you'll find similarly, if differently phrased, positions in (oddly, given

too). no?
 
Darn it . . . drawn in yet again:  sure different positions, but doesn't
your statement assume that you can purge the "tradition" of WcW's
presence?  That we don't need him?  Sure, there were alternatives to him,
differently phrased positions, certainly, but you are arguing against
history here.  Rimbaud and Keats and WcW made different versions of
poetics available.  Just as you must deal with Whitman, you must deal
with WcW's influence (though admitedly on a whole different scale).  It's
not a question of substituting different versions of poetics for another
(though this raises an interesting question of just that possibility),
but, rather, of attending to the polyphony of different voices in
dialogue with each other.  Obviously, wcw is in dialogue with keats, etc,
rejecting him, what have you.  Perhaps WcW has obscured keats to us or
vice versa, but rather than simply deny wcw's influence or presence in
american poetics maybe we should be accounting for what he was writing
against (specifically) and how that has filtered our perceptions of him
and those whom he writes against.  I think Ed makes this point, perhaps,
though in three lines or less it must be difficult.  Yes, someone give Ed
more lines.  Please.  Most importantly, I am willing to go along with WcW
and what he was writing against.  If there were alternatives to his
version that were obscured by his canonization I'd be willing to
entertain thoughts on them.

Ed,
Could you spell out your position re WCW & his supposed lack of relevance
more clearly, (I *might* agree given a context)-- Not trying to start a
fight. The discussion reminds me a bit of Cage's remarks about
"masterpieces"-- that a masterpiece is something one continues to find
something new in, but that doesn't seem to hold true. Seems that we can
actually use up a piece of art. . . Is that (uh-oh) post modern? Is Duchamp
still "new"? If not what the hell is? Or is it a mistake to look for
something new? If WCW's used up, Olson must be to. Berrigan seems new to me,
but how describe. . . Is it a matter of attitude? of the poet &/or the
reader? bla bla bla?

It may be a sad truth, but the reality is that if Spring & All were
published for the first time today, it would still be the most
innovative and forward thinking book of the year, and would have been
so in any of the past 25 years. How we have gone from that to the
current norm of bland one-page abstract lyrics befuddles me....

In reference, I think, to the "dangerous" thread, Aldon deployed superb
wit in his reference to FBI/MFA agents.  I want to suggest, however, that
this situation is perhaps changing.  The academy has been infiltrated at
Buffalo, UC Santa Cruz and (?).  Here at George Mason's MFA program
(which has at least five subscribers to this list), I was able to bring
Rod Smith into the teaching fold, and in the past year and a half we've
had Susan Howe and Leslie Scalapino among the few two-day residencies we
can afford.  This fall, it's Rosemarie Waldrop.  A number of the
poet-grad students are writing linguistically innovative work and
frequent Rod's Bridge Street Books.  The student mag, -Phoebe- featured
work of interest to this list in the last issue.  I don't know what's
happening elsewhere, as I've always been somewhat isolated, but this
isn't a closed shop.  BTW, the new person at AWP's newsletter, The
Chronicle (also now based here) is a subscriber to this list, and would
welcome essays from any of you.  I'm not naive about that audience, so
why not begin with something on how to *read*.

How It Happened
for Ron Silliman
 
After centuries, it was finally clear--
We had lost it. But where did it go?
We asked the witch, hiding behind the television,
But she was only picking her nose. The validation
Had come through on the backs of stormtroopers
In plaid, but when we went to apply it
To our balance, some goons, it turned out,
Had hauled away our collateral in a wheelbarrow.
"No ideas but in love songs," said the radio,
And it went straight into all our poems,
Which were utterly, utterly up front
About the situation.

it.
 
When it's put online (next week I think), you can access it through

To build off of what Carolyn has said is happenning at GM, I thought it
might be of interest to the list to know what's been happenning here at (the
dreaded) Writer's Workshops at The U of Iowa.
 
1)  The most single most requested poet in a pole of the the students
this semester for who they would like to see come and give a reading was
Michael Palmer.  So, he's coming in November.
 
2)  In the second year class (my class), out of approx. 25 students,
fully one third of them is working quite consciously in a "language" or
"avante-guard" tradition, and at least one-half (though probably more) of
the second year class, reads and is familiar and is at least partially
influenced by the "language" poets.
 
3)  Perhaps most interesting (and wonderful), however, is that next semester
(Jan.), Bob Perelman will be the visiting faculty member in the WS.  Talk about
infiltration....
 
SO, it seems things are changing all over, even at the most "established"
of the "establishment".  Faculty here are finding themselves having to at
least address "language" poetry in class.  In fact, over the summer in a
seminar in contemporary poetry, the teacher asked who the students were
reading and who they would like to discuss during the class, and EVERY
one of them mentioned an "experimental" writer.  I'm not sure what to
make of it...but I'm happy it's happening.
 
Apologies for all terms in quotes -- it seems silly to use them any other
way.
 
Best,
Brian Cassidy

Cris,
 
To answer some of your questions out of order I can't remember
everything but. . . . Most of the Poets Theater work happened AFTER
A-24. By '78 maybe only a performance of FOH's Try! Try! at the Grand
Piano (w/ Carla Harryman, Nick Robinson, & . . . John Mason?) and
maybe a short play by Carla &/or Eileen Corder had been done. The Big
Productions (3rd Man, Mister Sister, The Alps, Collateral, Particle Arms,
Under the Midwest, etc.) at Studio Eremos came later. As for A-24, yeah,
it was fun. A lot of hard work, intense rehearsals, trying to get the timing
right. I don't remember awkwardness, just the difficulty of staying on the
beat and still rendering the proper expression, not to mention dynamics.
As in theater, a marvelous way to get to know a work. And I think we all
enjoyed the experience of working in a group, especially as writers normally
don't (all rengae aside).

Building on what Aldon and Carolyn are saying about inclusion into a
let us say mainstream, I can't help but note in this context Hank Lazer's
essay in the recenet APR of Charles Bernstein (though the only poems
of Charles' I recall seeing printed there in the past have been, to my
mind, uncharacteristic of his work over all and more like the kind of
stuff one usually sees in APR--but then again maybe the journal is
changing, seeing as how it has such a large spread on Armand Schwerner who
is not a Language poet but whose work is by no means for the casual reader).

MFA programs may be the best recruitment agency yet developed for the
avant-garde (oppositional, experimental, pomo, multiculti, etc etc).
Due to its positioning among the academy, where some (few) folks are
beginning (just now) to question conventional modes of writing, workshop
type stuff (as it is stereotyped) seems more and more theoretically
bankrupt.
     The best poets feel this, and look elsewhere.But...
     The AWP is dead. Long live..........the AWP?
     We'll see. I know I have still go a very long way to go before
I can finally purge the workshop from my writing.
     Thanks, Eric.

Jail is interesting. The problem is you cannot get out, even when you are so
clearly in. This is probably less about poetry than it is about the list to
which you subscribe but which you cannot ever read because the machine will
not allow you to. (For machine read the form of the setting, or the setting
of the form.) Glad for the equinox. Best wishes to those who continue to read
what is written.

And another book to announce.
 
Minnesota Center for Book Arts is publishing TALKING THE BOUNDLESS BOOK:
ART, LANGUAGE, AND THE BOOK ARTS. I compiled and edited the collection of
talks which were given at Minn. Center for Book Arts's 1994 symposium, Art &
Language: Re-Reading the Boundless Book. I wrote the introduction, and there
are essays by Dick Higgins, Johanna Drucker, Steven Clay, Charles Bernstein,
Susan Bee, Amos Paul Kennedy Jr., Byron Clercx, Alison Knowles, Jo Anne
Paschall, Karen Wirth, Katherine Kuehn, Linda Reinfeld & Toshi Ishihara,
Colette Gaiter, and Brad Freeman. The essays range from artists talking
about their own works and those which have influenced them, to pieces on
hermeneutics and the book arts, the economics of small press/poetry
publishing, the social efficacy of the book arts, and more.
 
The book will be available the second week of November. Orders are being
taken now by
Ann Somers
Minnesota Center for Book Arts
24 North Third Street
Minneapolis, MN  55401
612-338-3634
 
The price is $15.95. A $4 shipping/handling charge will be added as well.
D.A.P is distributing the book to bookstores, and they are a good art
publication distributor, so you should see it in at least some bookstores
before Christmas.
 
Unfortunately, orders can not be taken online.
 
If the center gives me a more detailed announcement, I may post again about
this before long.

you are referring to at the Ear Inn and for some reason I have the same
thought about him. I think of him as the owner. It's an unconscious
assumption I have made, I guess, without a qualifying reason. Perhaps it's
the sense of authority they have, and I don't mean that negatively.
 
People with books:
 
I can see there are people who run bookstores on this list and I can see
that some of them are upset. I can only say that I have never had an
encounter in a bookstore like the one in St Marks, as far as I can
remember. I kind of think of bookstores as benign rather peaceful places.
Anyway ti's great to get all this info about where to buy books.
I should start a d base

Subject:      Distribution
 
Sorry I'm running late replying to this thread.
 
I am currently setting up a small press distribution network in Sydney
which will handle Australian small press stuff in the first instance but we
may well be able to take some os stuff after we get up and running. I'll
keep list members up to date. (we will also run stores at readings seminars
and the like and it may be possible to take one or two copies of o/s
magazines to sell on consignment that way - we'll see).
 
There have been a number of attempts to set up distribution networks in
Australia over the years. Most have them have fallen down because of the
distances involved. You really need to have staff in each capital city and
given Australia's small population and massive distances the economics just
don't add up. We are trying to overcome this by limiting ourselves to the
city and thye bookshops we know the best.
 
We will be also be setting up a virtual bookshop so a whole lot of
Australian small press publications should become available shortly via the
net.

wcw isn't boring because he's easily imitated; i don't find cage boring, tho i can't imagine anyone easier to imitate. the "boring" i think has to do with being somewhere between formerly useful and not quite historical (or commonly read as "was).

well, jeffrey, i'd have to argue with "dialogue," too; there are poetries that are interesting to read that way, but essentially that's bahktin, who got tossed out quite a while ago. and in any case what's interesting is writing, not "about."

George, you have the dates right but the month wrong. The "greatest pianist

a student workshop with no performance scheduled) in October, I think
between the 14-18.
 
I don't know how many poets are signed up for this, but, uh, perhaps this
is this still more proof of the opening up of the workshop.
 
Or maybe not.

Maria,
 
While any bureaucracy has its pull toward closing down the movements toward
energy, it seems as though the ripples can come from anywhere. When the
department holds its nose to progress, then build connections outside the
department. When the University suggests that it likes the way things are,
still nominate your most interesting students for the prizes. I am forever
optimistic that energy will have its impact on the bureaucratic system. I
am time and again the bureaucrat at Brown, putting the brakes on one or
another writers' great ideas (resources...limits...etc.). But we seem to
respect the need to let writing float into the atmosphere in as many ways
as possible. We have the great good fortune to have been founded by
sorts who have cosmpolitan/energetic ideas about literature -- and have
been able to sustain that tradition with new faculty hires. I'm sort
of the oddball in the mix (what is known here as a hybrid appointment, a
non-tenure-track administrator/teacher). The hours are frustrating, but
the environment is explosiv.

Pentium" Pro Processor Builds on Equity in Pentium Brand
  On Sept 19,1995 -- Intel Corporation announced that "Pentium" Pro
  processor" is the name for its next-generation microprocessor,
  previously code-named P6.  The 5.5 million transistor device will
  be introduced in the fourth quarter of this calendar year, and will
  be targeted at workstation and high-end desktop systems, as well as
  cost-effective servers.  The Pentium Pro processor will deliver the
  highest level of performance on 32-bit software for the Intel
  architecture.
 
 "By naming the next-generation processor `Pentium Pro,' Intel is
  building on the equity in the Pentium name while signifying that
  this is something beyond the original," explained G. Carl Everett,
  senior vice president, Desktop Products Group at Intel.  "Among
  target market segments, the Pentium brand has an awareness level as
  high as 95 percent, according to our research.  Intel believes the
  next-generation processor will benefit immensely from this
  association as we introduce it into the marketplace."
 
 The Pentium Pro processor is the first product of a parallel
  engineering effort undertaken by Intel in the early 1990s.  Its
  unique Dynamic Execution engine was conceived when today's Pentium
  processor was still a software simulation.  The compressed design
  cycles of new generations of chips have resulted in the delivery of
  some of the most powerful, low-cost microprocessors for a widening
  spectrum of uses.  For example, Intel was recently selected by the
  U.S. Department of Energy to build a 9,000-processor computer based
  on the Pentium Pro processor that will deliver 10 times the
  performance of today's fastest supercomputers.
 
 For more information on the Pentium Pro processor visit Intel's
  home page on the World Wide Web at URL http://www.intel.com/.
  Coming soon, those visiting Intel's web site will have the
  opportunity to create a 3D image rendered on a Pentium Pro
  processor-based web server located in Oregon.  For more information
  on the availability of the rendering machine, please subscribe to
  Intel's Pentium Pro processor mailing list by sending an e-mail to
  p6info-request@mailbag.intel.com and place the word "subscribe" in
  the first line of the body of the message.

Subject:      AWPAPRWCWS&A
 
Associate Professor of English, U. of Louisville
Phone: (502)-852-5918; e-mail: acgold01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu
 
On the AWP part, I'm greatly enjoying this mutual infiltration process (sounds
like a new technique for brewing coffee); Gwyn, Carolyn, Brian, thanks for
your recent posts, and it's good to have you as part of the conversation. I
appreciate the anecdotal information (who's visiting where, who's reading
whom, who's writing what)--for me it's simultaneously fun gossip, usable
information, and stuff that helps me as a teacher to start de-monolithizing
the institution of the workshop. (How's that for a neologism? No Bruce Andrews
action doll could do better.)
 
 
Burt K. mentioned Hank's APR essay. I actually think APR has always been a bit
more eclectic than it's given credit for, but its eclecticism has less the
quality of a commitment to multiple writing practices, more the quality of the
startled twitch that one gives when one is suddenly woken up. ("Oops, looks
like we'd better pay attention to this, even if we are 15 or 20 years late.")
To put this another way, it's not yet clear to me that we're seeing, in APR,
more than a kind of belated tokenism attached to one of the big names of LP.
Charles is acutely attuned to these institutional/literary-sociological
issues, it seems to me. I don't agree, then, Burt, that APR has published work
of his in a traditionally APR mode. The poems they've carried are, in my
reading, progressively more blatant gestures of resistance to and satires on
that mode. If the editors don't get it after publishing the last one,
"Memories," then I feel sorry for them. (And if they've already gotten it and
aren't letting on, then good for them.) The real test for APR will be to see
if they start publishing lesser-known or under-published "experimental"
writers, as they do with their flush-left-first-persons.
 
My last few years teaching incline me to agree with Ron about Spring and All.
Students consistently find it a revelation, "a place of first permission" in
Duncan's phrase. My problem with the recent discussions pro and con is that
they seem to depend on reifying "The Red Wheelbarrow" as somehow synecdochic
of WCW's whole practice. (Granted, one or two folks here and there mentioned
other poems.) There's perverse precedent for this. New Critical resistance to
WCW for decades was based on objections, repeated mantra-like in critic after
critic, to "The Red Wheelbarrow." But one of the many great things about S&A
is its polymorphousness, lost when it's reduced to a handful of anthology
chestnuts. When I read the first ten lines or so of Spring and All #9 ("What
about all this writing?") or #6 ("No that is not it") I hardly recognize the
poet of "The Red Wheelbarrow" (not so titled, of course--not titled at all--in
the original S & A).

Thanks to Carolyn and all who followed with the good news of incipient
change -- Mason & Phoebe were dead as Ed thinks Williams is back when I
lived in the area -- & any opening out of the AWP news is news indeed --
I was getting tired of that "theory sucks & nobody can read anymore" line --
 
I too had noticed that a cadre of students was begninning to show up on
campus actually asking to read people like Bernstein, Palmer, Hejinian,
Berssenbrugge   (of course, since I'd been playing the poetry of these
folk on the radio in hopes of creating such a demand, I can't claim to be
entirely caught off guard by this)
 
But we are mostly taliking about small inroads -- the reading program at
our campus is still firmly in the hands of a younger gurad with old guard
ambitions -- I have never been able to get _any_ body added to the list
-- Best I could do was get the guy to invite Mackey, who, living just
over the hill, didn't cost much money in travel -- but he wouldn't even
invite Nate till books from Cambridge & Coffee House & City Lights began
popping up all over the place --
 
With all this infiltration going on, maybe we will soon be the old farts
the new writers overthrow (perhaps with yet another return to
Williams?!?) -- not a bad fate to contemplate --

Subject:      Re: incursion / attaching to the host
 
I am glad to hear of Carolyn Forche's work at George Mason.
Intrigued too by the report from Iowa (& found that news rather
surprising).  Personally, I have been committed to such work for
quite some time.  Most recent results, the article on Charles
Bernstein in APR, and a section called "The Other South" in the
current issue of the New Orleans Review.
 
The APR essay was 40 pages in manuscript.  APR did not cut the essay
at all--which surprised me.  I sent it to them after calling Stephen
Berg and asking if he'd be interested.  He made no commitment
whatsoever, said the essay would be read by the three editors.  I
asked for a quick response--I assumed they would not take it, and I
would send it elsewhere quickly.  After two months, I badgered them,
and they took the essay (that was about a year ago).
 
The special section in New Orleans Review--which includes work by
several people on this list (Paul Naylor, Jake Berry, Lisa Samuels,
etc.)--was put together by Bill Lavender.  He did an extraordinary
job, locating an exciting range of "southern" (US) poetry.  If you're
interested in the results, e-mail me backchannel.  I have a few extra
copies, and would be glad to mail you one.
 
As in the previous discussion of independent bookstores ... if these
and other similar incursions appeal to you, it might be worthwhile to
write the editors and note your approval.  I know that in the case of
the New Orleans Review, letters of support would lend credibility to
the wonderful work that Bill Lavender did.  In fact, the magazine
might continue to give him space if there is an interest in the "new"
work.
 
And as part of this purgative de-lurking, I also have a collaborative
(with Yunte Huang) prose piece on Chinese poetry-politics  in the
current issue of Central Park.

I've been quite interested in the ongoing WCW discussion.  Normally,
I would be contra-Foster, but I've just been teaching and re-reading
Spring and All.  Yes, Ron Silliman's point is, alas, correct:  Spring
and All would still, today, be a difficult manuscript to get
published.  And yes, Alan Golding, I believe, is right: for many
readers, including many today, Spring and All provides a place of
permission.  But personally, this time through Williams, my own
response is closer to Ed Foster's--I'm not finding much that excites
me.  Thus, back to points raised by Rod Smith and Ed Foster
both--when is a work "used up."  For me, some WCW, including much of
Spring & All, is beginning to sputter, to run on fumes.  Which makes
me want to re-read Paterson....?

A new chapbook from WellSweep.
 
Yang Lian has been published in Talisman and Conjunctions 23.
 
Also he really exists (he's actually staying here with us at the=
 moment),
so don't worry about the Yasusada syndrome.
 
Also, please check out Wellsweep's web site:
 
        http://www.inforamp.net/~cayley/wshome.html
 
and a new page of sample poems published in its books:

WHERE THE SEA STANDS STILL
 
Yang Lian
 
WellSweep Chinese Poets 6+
translated by Brian Holton
 
Yang Lian (born 1955) is one of the best-known of the so-called 'misty'=
 or
'ambiguist' poets who came to prominence in China during the 1980s.=
 He has
published six collections of poetry and two anthologies of prose=
 in Chinese.
His work has been translated into many European languages, and English
versions of his poems have been widely published in magazines. WellSweep
brought out a book-length collection of his shorter poems, Non-Person
Singular in 1994. 'Where the Sea Stands Still' is the first complete
publication of Yang Lian's most recent work. It is the most important=
 piece
he has written since leaving China. Yang Lian's ever-moving 'sea'=
 stands
still in the midst of its restlessness; it is here in the midst of=
 nowhere;
and in the space of the poem, time is swept away. Because of Odysseus,=
 the
sea began its endless ebb and flow; when this sequence was written,=
 the sea
stood still, and became an illusion.
 
Brian Holton teaches Chinese at the Universities of Newcastle and=
 Durham. He
is also the translator of WellSweep's first collection of Yang Lian's
poetry, Non-Person Singular.
 
The book reproduces paintings inside and on the cover by Gao Xingjian,=
 a
pioneer of avant-garde literature in China who is best-known internationally
as a dramatist. In 1989 Gao moved to Paris as a political exile and=
 in 1992
he was made Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres de la France.=
 His
paintings have been exhibited in numerous one-person and group exhibitions,
and are held in the collections of many public galleries throughout=
 Europe.
 
32 pp, 21 x 13 cm, parallel text. 4 b/w illustrations.
 
GBP=A32.95 (US$6) pbk ISBN 0 948454 25 3
This edition is strictly limited to 200 copies. It is only available=
 direct
from the publisher.
26 additional copies have been printed on special papers and bound=
 by sewing
(rather than stitching). Inquiries welcome.

Well, fortunately, ed, WcW will not be "tossed out" anytime soon.  Why
this penchant for purgation?
 
As for eric's and Hank's recent posts: geez, do I have to admit WcW is
not exactly exciting?  To me it's not so much a question of
excitment/boredom as it is a matter of knowing why he did (DID) matter.
What was it he did that was (WAS) important?  No where was this
discussed; matter of fact dismissal, while making good posts, is another
matter when it comes to accounting for a particular poets relevance.
Bahktin may not be cutting edge any longer, but is he any less useful?
NO, in case you thought otherwise.  Peter Stallybrass's work with B. has
been very important and is still very relevant.
 
Two other things: eric: i was thinking about your picasso comment and
think that, yes, WcW is something along the same lines (though P. is
obviously more exciting and important)a;  that is, he has been absorbed,
he no longer shocks.  Have you listened to The Rite of Spring lately.
Those pounding rhythms must have been distressful at one point, but they
no longer shock.  Quite tame, really, compared to the new Strapping Young
Lad CD.
 
I forgot the other thing....  Um....  Well, anyway, what I've found
disappointing about this exchange is the lack of discussion about why he
is boring. And, really, is that even a word to be using?  I mean, I have
not learned a thing from such a dismissal.  Tell me what's exciting.  Or
let me tell you . . . .

Amen to what Cris is saying.
On the other hand I am thinking that perhaps no permission is needed in
any case because anything posted is in the public domain? EPC should be
thanked as courtesy.  On the other hand, in the improbable case that some
money will be made from publishing any rengas in whole or in part,
perhaps the money should be donated to the institution where the list
originates, i.e., SUNY at Buffalo, which pays for EPC.

(Gulp) Okay. Here goes.
 
     When the Senorita Died
 
     12: 24 and Chimes Street is all perturbed with heat.
     It's summer, five days after the Shrimp and
     Petroleum Festival, yes, and I am looking for a tab
     with my coffee. I have to see Jackie and Dennis
     for a late lunch, but at this point, all I am
     thinking about is where I will find my next hit.
 
     At the Lebanese, I have an Abita and
     cheese fries and buy APR to see what folks
     are doing in the real world. There's a feature
     on Merwin and something about the Pacific
                             but I toss it into the street
     and go to the Varsity because Alice (Quietcar, I think)
     will be tending bar and she gives out free martinis
     if you can remember who played the night before.
     The cool thing is she never knows so I say Orlando
     and for once she doesn't check with the front desk
     and shakes up a 'tini while I wait.
 
     This is Louisiana, so I head off with drink in hand
     to Highland, for the latestHaraway, but find it
     all too langweilig so sit by Godfather's
     to watch until  Dolores comes by
     because she always has Wired and US News
     and World Report and on the front page I
     see here name outlined in red ink,
 
     and I shiver and I remember Four Aces in Brownsville
     trying to piss in a trough with five other fellows
     while while she whined a song along with the accordian
     and everyone and I stopped micturating
 
INcidentally, I should say that I am working on my exams now, and at some
point in my life will surely discredit everything that I've said on this
list so far for the reason that I am very very grouchy.Also, isn't it still
true that the sincerest form of flattery is imitation (please say so)?

In response to Charles Bernstein's request: My only book publication
is U. S. OBSERVATORIES (Van Nostrand Reinhold). This is a book about
observatories. It has a number of good pictures in it, taken by
observatories, who have very good cameras. The book is out of print
and if anyone sees it in the astronomy section of a used book store I
wish you would buy it and let me buy it from you since I only have
2-3 copies myself. It tends to get stolen from libraries.

thanks gale, good to hear/see from you,  and to some extent, esp w/ students,
it happens "naturally" --(like, who else wd i nominate for prizes --my most
boring students?, and yes, that works, tho because of my limited credibility
--my intellectual orientation is considered eccentric by my shakespearean and
woolfian colleagues --my students end up w/ the $500 prizes rather than the
$1500 main prizes --it's still something, and they feel supported and
believed in, which is the most impt. thing).  my ego still gets in there,
tho, and that's one of the main casualties of this professional life, i think
--in a field where intellectual property is everything, it can hurt to do
something for years and not get anywhere, then some shallow hotshot (or worse
yet, some square with a lot of local institutional power who suddenly
"discovers", say , lyn hejinian) comes in and with one word makes your field
legit --but you still don't get any "credit"... well, that's an issue for the
daily meditation practice i guess and while it's as "real" or unreal as
anything else and thus merits saying, it merits saying only so that one (i)
can then move beyond that sphere of concern and be really real, like, do my
own thing and invite others to join...i.e. more of same...sorry everyone for
airing these petty ego concerns but some of you might just relate...i

After the first 500 examples, or thereabouts, all these rengae begin to
take on a terrible sameness, even the new threads. Maybe it has to do
with that slightly overbloated line length that seems so invariable.
What is it about this form that imposes these limitations?

rather than start a new renga myself (performance anxiety) i need to amend my
earlier statement abt sympathizing w/ renga-deleters.  what i' finding, and
this is an interesting tho not novel or unpredictable revelation to me about
my own mind, technology etc --is this:  because i can't "skim" the rengas but
have to really read them, they are alternately the most thrilling,
life-giving msgs on the list, and the most distracting and daunting.  when
i'm panicked for time --as i now am, being on aol rather than a gratis univ.
system --it takes a commitment of attention i initially resent but (like
schlepping to the library to do research) ends up being gratifying in
unpredictable ways --i never know what i'll learn, and the rengas alter my
consciousness more than, say, my own whining about lack of institutional
support for my field, or discussions about the usefulness of wcw.
 
by the way, what does "a single angel is frightening"  mean: that more angels
are less frightening because angels are not meant to be alone, or that if a
single angel is scary, imagine how scary a whole flock wd be?-md

Subject:      Re: WCW
 
Ed, a good part of what makes your stance unconvincing is how much it
depends on actions that occur without agency (e.g., Bahktin who "got
tossed out awhile ago" without saying why or who did such tossing). As
someone who was reading him in '72 and felt that the whole fad served
only to bring works into print and who was pleased to see the MLA kudzu
die back from that arena, I still find real value in his work. And
Williams also. There is an assumption in your stance that just because
someone's work is situated in a context, say, of the 1930s, that its
value remains there. In fact, even when someone undergoes an intense
period of adoption, as WCW did (or Olson or Duncan or Creeley more
recently), it is arguable whether all that exists within the work ever
gets excavated by readers or usefully understood by other
practitioners. One can read Wordsworth absolutely for his contemporary
(or as they say at Duke, post-contemporary) values. Why not Williams
also? What about all this writing?

tho hold out for bits of _Imaginations_ -- so, what's so bad abt Bakhtin
again? Is Olson in the same space as WCW, do ya think?
 
Remember an interview w/ a Poundian named Carlo Parcelli where the
interviewer asked him, really, "What makes Olson so good?" & he replied
"Because he's not a poet, he's a historian."
Which I still find both interesting & cause for loss of cookies.

I recall that way back when Douglas Messerli was still teaching, at Temple,
he had only one outraged graduate seminar (being of course an otherwise not
only brilliant but beloved instructor): in a modern poetry course he
spozedly taught /Spring & All/ & /Kora in Hell/, and the students were just
irrevocably non-plussed--and Temple wasn't, as it isn't, ahem, Iowa, or I
guess in light of recent posts I should say "Iowa."
Gen-you-wine OH-pacity.

Think what's dangerous is certainly contextual. Are, in the phrase of a
friend of mine, the "so-called Nuyoricans" dangerous? Somehow, on MTV, no.
But in person some of them, powerful, convincing, useful.
 
The infiltration oddly neither group nor individual-- walking into a workshop
situation there seems group resistance to "experimental," but individual,
perhaps, acceptance. Though this is also a matter of search for group
vocabulary with which to discuss these things, if one imposes the terms it
becomes rote & nobody learns anything. So I'm neither comfortable nor
uncomfortable teaching, but consider, suppose "we" "win"-- what does *that*
mean. This is putting it on the line folks, will the terms change, even a
little? Since this seems my night to quote interviews, in the Cage/Retallack
thing I published she asked him whether he thought artists could change "the
grammar of the way we are together." His response was a long pause & then "we
don't know, but we can try." Seems to me we're really talking about trying to
change what Weber called "the iron cage or bureaucracy" & we'd oughta be
prepared to fail grandiosely &/"or else" succeed,
w/ a whimper (not a bang).

(Sorry if you receive this twice - the Sydney Uni server was down on the
weekend and I'm note sure whether this got through)
 
Sorry I'm running late replying to this thread.
 
I am currently setting up a small press distribution network in Sydney
which will handle Australian small press stuff in the first instance but we
may well be able to take some os stuff after we get up and running. I'll
keep list members up to date. (we will also run stores at readings seminars
and the like and it may be possible to take one or two copies of o/s
magazines to sell on consignment that way - we'll see).
 
There have been a number of attempts to set up distribution networks in
Australia over the years. Most have them have fallen down because of the
distances involved. You really need to have staff in each capital city and
given Australia's small population and massive distances the economics just
don't add up. We are trying to overcome this by limiting ourselves to the
city and thye bookshops we know the best.
 
We will be also be setting up a virtual bookshop so a whole lot of
Australian small press publications should become available shortly via the
net.

Speaking of hot shots -- Dinesh D'Souza has just published a book, _The
End of Racism_, in which he asserts that slavery was not a racist
institution.  Young Mr. D'Souza got a grant five times the size of yours
to "research" this book, and has been featured in two successive issues
of the Chronicle of Higher Ed. --  He shows that he is not a racist by
disagreeing with _The Bell Curve's_ arguments that intelligence is both
hereditary and racial, then proceeds to argue that black Americans just
happen to belong to a culture whose unwise life choices leads to them
doing less well on intelligence tests.
 
Back in the forties, C.L.R. James wrote that "It is instructive to read
the old monographs, articles, volumes, disputes on Negro intelligence,
tests, the shape of the head, the weight of the brain, etc.  Today all
that is dead."
 
well, you can't be right all the time -- but now that racism is at its
"end" I suppose we don't need to worry about such things anymore --
 
As another former D.C. resident used to say:
"Makes me wanna holler, throw up _both_ my hands!"

Gwyn,
 
(Sorry to everyone else as this should be directed) -- does the AWP have
back-issues of the Chronicle going back to origins? Christina Milletti,
a graduate student here at Brown, is researching the Chronicle, but cannot
get her hands on the early issues.
 
Her electronic address is Christina_Milletti@brown.edu.
 
Many thanks, and apologies to everyone else.

Thousnads of people died today for want of what could be found in poetry
in what authorities are describing as the most tragic aesthetic disaster
of the century.  Exact figures are not yet available, but New Jersey
disaster relief officials describe their region as particularly hard
hit.  One survivor interviewed at the Joyce Kilmer rest stop reported
that she narrowly averted the fate that suddenly befell all those around
her because she happened to glance at a scrap of verse someone had
written on a wall just as nearly all the other passengers in her van
collapsed from ennui.

magazine. Is "Poetics" the same thing as "Poetry"?  I don't mean to be
restrictive, but, as the joke goes about the husband (no sexism intended) who
petitions the judge for a divorce from his wife of fifty years, and the
judge asks, why, after all this time could you possibly want a divorce, the
husband replies, "Enough is enough already!"

The subject pretty much says it all.  I have a piece that is supposedly due
out in the next issue of _Poetics Journal_, but it's been in this state for
*years* & I've been assuming the magazine simply died.  Does anyone know if
it is "officially" dead?

I took this as a post on naming in society, circa 1995, and found it
absolutely compelling. The Pentium Pro, which will be a household name
in about 3 years, is what we once would have called a "686" had the
copyright laws not failed to protect Intel's claim to ownership of the
"xx86" convention for computer chips. Note that Intel, which invoked
the figure 5 in its Pentium, does not continue the stepping process
with this next generation chip. That is an attempt to shake off AMD and
the other clone chip manufacturers and parallels, at least at a
distance, Microsoft's leaping changes in its Microsoft Word for
Windows, which went from 2.0 to 6.0 without intermediate steps (which
existed, however, in DOS) and from Windows 4.0 (nee "Chicago") to
Windows 95 (a name that's going to get OLD fast).
 
While they're not as aggressively silly and Americo-centric as the
internet features named after Archie comix characters, it's worth
noting that the naming styles of the computer industry have had (and
are having, as we speak (if this be speech)) differs dramatically from
the nature of such conventions earlier in the century. I forget who
first noted that discourses that are insecure about their knowledge
tend to be pompous in their terminologies, viz. the use of Latin to
characterize in English what Freud simply called the I, the it and the
superI. Or structuralism's love of acronyms (think of Althusser and all
that type wasted on ISA, RSA etc.).
 
I already feel "fond" of how Pentium Pro suggests that the Pentium chip
itself is somehow amateurish (up until 6 months ago, 95 percent of all
Pentium systems were being sold to home users--the corporate ramp-up is
very slow, but the home buyer wants the full suite of bells and
whistles NOW).

 In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
 And flew through windows, lightning green and fine morning
 First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
 The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
 Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
 The rook to the knight here by King's Bishop Three
 Something has changed in the nature of friendship
 But wouldn't you know it, Mrs. Mullett next in line
 For food stamps, quints racing about the linoleum
 Everything leans on the verb, falling, sighs
 Twelve at least, one loves only firm, and firm
 feels good to her it feels real good, & the corset
 blanches from so many passwords being lifted like expected bans
 on metaphors that the folks at the contagious hospital
 thought we might be weaned of early, late, whatever,
 but I am taking the broken glass as a token of my first epiphany
 sassafras is my powerlessness to split scintillas in the mist
 of lathering first frost as noon comes on like torqued weed
 sucking on the indescribable and taking the ineffable for a walk
 to Paris via seed cigars and chicory and plantain butts
 mixed with automaton condolences nixed by Dr. Reynolds

While few people (if any) go to the trouble to register copyright for
anything they post to newsgroups, mail lists, etc., everyone technically
"owns" the texts they write, regardless of the context in which they were
published. You may chose to (or not to) register your copyright with the
appropriate governmental agency, or you can assign it to EPC or whoever you
wish if you so choose, but the copyright for your words is yours unless you
take some kind of action.
 
Online text (or visuals or sound, or whatever) is not (yet) in the public
domain, despite the fact that it is often treated as if it is.
 
Which is not to deny the truth & utility of citing the situation and
location of the original "renga."
 
That said, add my name to the list of folks who zap rengas on sight.

Rumours here that carla Bley and Gary Peacock are coming to town No,
is it gary Peacock? Of course not, it's Steve Swallow, I think?
Anyway, if they do a trio, who is the drummer? Have I been sniffing

now Steve in turn says,
 
No, no, I didn't mean to say that Williams' whole project is a failure.  I
meant at those individual moments or poems where the actual work doesn't
quite measure up to the project.  I wouldn't say all his poems were
successful (by whatever criteria), just as I wouldn't say they all fail (how
wishy-washy of me!)  But I would amend your last statement:  the everyday is
not *inherently* trivial.  Some of us (people) make and experience it that
way all the time, and maybe all of us experience it that way much of the
time.  That's what makes the striking things so striking:  the contrast.

Good point.  The influence isn't going to go away, for awhile anyway.  It's
just a question of how loudly his voice sounds in our ears compared to all
the other voices.  Ed, maybe you're just sick of the New Jersey accent?

Why don't you start on a real Poetics topic that would be so engrossing
that even the rengans would stop what they are doing and come listen in
awed silence?
 
Things that probably count less as poetics than poetry making:
 
list of bedside readings
announcements about readings
bibliographical info
commercial info (book x available from press y)
anecdotes about bookstores
editorials about bookstores
comments about the political scene
jokes (in prose)
anagrams
opinions about whether wcwilliams is boring or not

Subject:      "is my bubble showing?"
 
The collaborative poem dulls and repeats when it lacks context.
I'd say context is provided, and collective attentiveness created
by the prose discussion. When the prose flags, the poetry becomes
a-contextual somehow, performing eventual reifying services of the medium
itself. In this medium the critical specifity that social
contexts provide is made homogeneous and is virtually erased -
markers a/effecting context, for instance just the fact of a post
from New Zealand, or a post of Sept. 15th at 3:00 a.m. on a
rented computer, etc., all but their names are erased from the
emailed _message_ (in Jackobson's sense) itself, unlike,
obviously, a letter (e.g. a type of paper, ink, envelope, etc.,
in short, of a specific letter, from NZ). An established poet whose
name is a currency in many media/genres and an unknown name
floating solely in the listserv perform as peers, in a way, to
a context-in-the-making (if there will be any at all). The most
hardy and only context of the medium readily seems to be purely
the informational one of distributing news economically. Good
morning Virilio. Beyond that, what sort of informational poetics
can arise? There needn't be anything more, of course. But if
there is a desire for there to be something more, as perhaps the
collaborative poem is hopefully a signal of (shurely not the
opposite, that is, narcissistic emblems of a socioeconomically
stable/wealthy livelihood??)... - then it would seem,
tautologically, that social context will arise only through the
information contributed, and that this would take form in the
prose discussion (= the world). One available contextual tension
the medium can create for "itself" and its agents beyond the role
of information-distribution seems to be the dynamic between the
poetry and the prose. When the prose dimishes, so too the
poetry's affectivenes. I'm suggesting that the collaborative poem
diminishes in appeal when a) the fetishistic aspect of the medium
itself is allowed to dominate, going surreally out of control in
the form of sheer quantity of postings by single and few contributors to
the poem, and when b) there is a dwindling of prose dialogue -
the only means of supplying contexts of address for the
collaborative poem due to the character of the medium itself. So
I think that the dismissal of the poetry is misplaced, or at best
only half the story. Good night.

Ron:
 
thanks for the subtle (within the veil) excursus.  So it WAS poetry!  I
guess what I had in mind was a long poem Charles B read here in Tucson maybe
4-5 years ago now, which started with a long computer-blurb passage--which
was compelling just because attention divided (mine did that is) between
let's say materialized language or discourse AND, otoh, a kind of
techie-groupie interest in whatever software was being described.  So that:
what Bill posted is nice, and IS poetry (rather than "rhetoric" [as] if that
distinction still holds) because it's a little hard to tell whether one
isn't spozed to (just?) share the enthusiasm over the new sleek model.
 
Maybe "pro" just means the floating decimal works?
 
I sit and look out
hunkering on 386sx20 haunch

it's renga, but jeez, what the hell does it mean?

Subject:      Donald Davie 1922-1995
 
I'm taking time out from unexpectedly heavy grieving to note the loss
of a great British poet, Donald Davie. He and I corresponded and met
and, like at least some of the obituary writers on him in recent days,
fell out; I wish now, like some of them I suspect, that I had sorted
this out, but there always seemed more time to come. I only found out
that he'd died when I moved into a new flat and his face was peering
out of the obituary page of a newspaper in the bin in the empty room.
        He was always used as a whipping boy, an establishment figure
to rebel against, and rarely thanked for his critical work recommending
not just British poets but British poetry - as a poetry that should
be international and should make serious work with language, and let
language work on the poet. He was attacked jealously by many who wanted
his position of eminence (he could always get an article in the TLS
much better than any others there) but who would never do the labour,
of writing well at length and dealing with institutions, that Davie did
to *achieve* this eminence. It was always assumed that this eminence
was somehow given to him, as privilege, and always assumed that he
reacted out of fear and stupidity to certain areas of the avant-garde
that he didn't favour as much as he favoured Pound. For me, however,
his *criticisms* based on *reading* (rather than *assent*) of the
British avant-garde stick. See Barry and Hampson eds. _The Scope of
The Possible_, Manchester University Press, 1994, for a fine example
of such Davie-bashing.
        If his criticism was begrudged, his poetry was ignored; yet,
its emphasis on language, its sometimes entirely abstract pleasure with
difficult syntax and vocabulary, and its constant self-questioning
and interest in ideas and epistemology, certainly helped me, as a
schoolboy knowing only Philip Larkin, to bridge to Pound and, indeed,
the Language Writers - to whom he is much closer in energy and labour
and *vanguardism* (ie the desire to bring the future in, from the margin,
not stay in the margin) than any other post-war British poet. If I were
to compare him to a painter, I would say no other had such a fine grasp
of one aspect of her or his (colour/pigment/mixing/framing/brushwork)
art - for none has the skill below with vocabulary, with verbs, with
a form that is both syntactically spacious and *not* spare and
stripped-down in vocabulary; he is somewhere between Creeley/Neidecker
and Yeats, and that amazes me as a feat:
 
 
OX-BOW
 
 
        The time is at an end.
                The river swirled
      Into an ox-box bend, but now
        It shudders and re-unites:
        Adversary! Friend!
 
        Adverse currents drove
                This pair apart.
      A twin tormented throe embraced,
        Enisled between them, one
        Quadrant of earth, one grove.
 
        Now for each other they yearn
                Across the eyot
      That the particular flow of each
        Carved out, determined. Now,
        Now to each other they turn.
 
        And it is past belief
                That once they forked;
      Or that, upstream and bypassed, trees
        Mirrored in mid-reach still
        Break into annual leaf.

Jim,
 
I forwarded your question on to Lyn and Barrett, neither of whom are on
the Poetics List. There is some question of whether Barry ever READS
his email, but at least there is an address. The third editor (who has
never seen his work as such make it to print), Kit Robinson, may want
to reply in more detail.
 
My understanding is this. There was a long delay created by ye olde
funding problems plus the mind-numbing detail of getting the PhD and
doing the dissertation (no word yet on whether it has been completed).
On top of which, Barry has been deeply ambivalent about poetry (and
especially langpo) for some time. Kit was brought on to resolve some of
the workload and inertia issues, but when Barry toddled off to Detroit,
he took the manuscripts with him. Don't know where it currently stands.
I once noted that he had achieved a status with my manuscripts normally
reserved for the likes of Kirby Malone and Doug Messerli...greatest
time held without publication. He was not amused.
 
Frankly, it's reasonable in such a situation to insist on publication
or to take the work back.
 
The sad thing is that it was a great mag, particularly in the first
five issues or so.

Yes, everyone owns what they write, and can therefore give or refuse
permission to reproduce it. However, in some circumstances work can be
reproduced without copyright holder's permission, providing that "all
reasonable measures" to identify copyright holders and obtain permission
have been taken. In the case of "works of multiple authorship" where it's
difficult to identify individual rights, a rubric of this kind is often
used. Obviously, this doesn't apply where the copyright holder has
actually denied permission to reproduce. I'd say (privately, but not in
court) that contacting the list where the renga was written is taking "all
reasonable measures" providing that no mean-minded little so-and-so
actually objects personally...
 
Or to put it another way: if you've rung the renga writer for their rights
and got a ringer, you can quote the written renga with the writer's rights
unritten - you can rate their rights unbidden and so on -

Although in this renga in question, or at least in several versions of it,
at least one of the lines I wrote (and I suspect this is true for others as
well) has been altered by someone else without my permission. This has been
done in ways I don't like at all (and to this I object), and more radically
altered (the whole form of the renga) in ways I like quite a lot. So, whose
writing is it? Did someone violate my rights by altering it in the first place?

Maybe my objection makes me a mean-minded little so-and-so, except that I do
give permissions to use whatever version anyone wants to use for any purpose
whatsoever. But I think that this time I really mean it when I tell myself
I'm not contributing to the rengas any more.

It sounds like people are 12-stepping off the renga.
I hope you all are as weak about quitting as I suspect I am.
Louis, I'd like to see a demonstration, with charts,
of the correlation between quantity of prose
and zip in renga. Charles, as a renga debaser,
I apologize. Rights squabblers--go directly to the archive

I try to glance through each of these shameful books as they come
out. They make me want to wretch. But D'Souza's should be marked out
for special attention. It is truly execrable. It even inspired the
normally complacent Richard Rorty to something like moral outrage
in the latest NYTBR.
 
One expects the resurgence of "scientific" racism in things like THE
BELL CURVE at a time like this in our country, and knows the
tremendous amount of argument & evidence that can be brought to bear
against it as well -- small if cold comfort. But D'Souza's book goes
so far beyond that -- making the most outrageous and unbelievable
assertions (slavery not being racist among them). It is just gross.
 
Here's a thought: at least one group besides "minorities" gets
"preferential treatment" in the US: young, callow, mean-spirited, dumb
conservatives, especially if they have some minority background or
other. I could name names.
 
I will fabricate a relation between this topic and Poetics (or at
least renga) if pressed.

I've been lurking for a while but have to put in my vote: PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, renga writers, get your own chat list! Yes, enough is enough. I
don't have sophisticated email and can't filter messages, and I'm tired
of my account getting clogged up and slowed down to the speed of sloths

Please excuse my rancor, but it does seem that people on this list are

What counts as "poetics," Jorge asks? A reasonable enough question, to which I
wish I had an answer. However: in Jorge's list of 10 "things that probably
count less as poetics than poetry-making," one could find at least half in the
poetry-making of (for instance) Pound, Olson, H.D., David Antin, Susan Howe .

read wordsworth, i suppose, for his "contemporary values" (whatever that

summer in the alps, written today, runs a risk of being either precious
or parody. my heavens, what are you doing defending lyricism, but since
that seems the point, welcome! you also seem to be saying (oddly, i should

As my first posting, I am listing publishing information for a book
recently published by the University Press of Florida.
 
AUTHOR:     Peter Baker
TITLE:      _Deconstruction and the Ethical Turn_
PRESS:      University Press of Florida
DATEP:      1995
PRICE:      $34.95
 
From the ad copy:
 
_Deconstruction and the Ethical Turn_ demonstrates the continuing
importance of deconstruction and other related movements for current
literary theory, insisting on the seriousness of the deconstructive
enterprise, its philosophical background, and its possible usefulness
for negotiating the political terrain of the postmodern university
   Peter Baker deals with the theories of such major figures as
Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, Emmanuel Levinas
and Julia Kristeva.  He concentrates on the ways that deconstruction
allows for an increased understanding of the ethical reading of texts
and disputes the view that it places all decision making in the realm

Comments: To: poetics <poetics@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>
 
I agree with Charles Bernstein that practice overtakes theory but I don't
want the kid next door to bang scales on the piano all day long while
I am trying to do anything with my head.  Therefore I have decided to buy
that kid an electric keyboad and earphones. As to me, I am leaving the public sector, the U.S. Department
of Renga, and returning to private practice. I think I have served
honorably though obnoxiously at times for which I apologize. I am going
to be a renga consultant, though, and if someone posts a renga, I
will probably add a line and send it back to the poster only not to the list.
I have already invited a number of people to send lines to me to start on
a number of private rengas. Once in a while we can send a ***closured***
renga to the list. If anybody wants to unclosure it, do it in the privacy
of your home and send it to us.
 
So on to the next topic. In all seriousness, I think that combatting
scientific racism is crucial.
 
In a lighter artery, anagram practice will never overtake theory so they
are ok in my estimation.
 
And so goodbye, an old rengan never cries, s/he just howls away.

With regard to Dinesh D'Souza: anybody else see the William Raspberry
column about the two writers whose names escape me, both black
conservatives, who were so incensed by DD'S's book that they publicly
dissasociated themselves from the American Enterprise Institute (the
"think" tank that ponied up the dough)?  It'll be interesting to see if
this "study" pits the right against itself: part of me would like to see
that, but part of me worries that such an event would lend support to the

Subject:      MILLENNIUM ANTHOLOGY
 
We -- Pierre Joris & Jerome Rothenberg -- would like to announce that
our anthology _POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM: The University of California
Book of Modern & Postmodern Poetry_ (Vol 1: From Fin-de-Siecle to
Negritude) has just come out.
        It will probably be a few weeks until copies hit the
bookstores, but meanwhile, for those interested & unable to wait that
long, we will post (as a separate, longish e-mail) the Table of
Contents to this list.
 
        Here is how UCP describes the book:
 
The University of California Press is Proud to Announce:
 
The First Global Anthology of 20th Century Poetry
 
 
Poems for the Millennium
The University of California Book of Modern and Postmodern Poetry
Volume One: From Fin-de-Siecle to Negritude
Edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris
 
0-520-07227-8  $24.95 paper
800 pages, 6 x 9", 20 b/willustrations
 
 
 
        POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM may well be the poetry
book-of-the-century: a synthesizing and global anthology with an
emphasis on those international and national movements that have tried
to change our ways of making poetry and art as a means  for changing
how we think & act as human beings.
 
        This first volume offers three "galleries" of individual poets
-- figures like Mallarme, Stein, Rilke, Tzara, Mayakovsky, Pound,
H.D.,Vallejo, Artaud, Cesaire, and Tsvetayeva--along with a sampling
of the most significant pre-World War II movements in poetry and the
other arts: -- Futurism, Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism,
"Objectivism," Negritude. The second volume will extend the gathering
to the present day, forming a synthesizing and global anthology that
goes beyond any existing twentieth-century collection in its cultural
scope and experimental range.
 
Jerome Rothenberg is a poet and one of the world's leading
anthologists. His more than fifty books include _Technicians of the
Sacred: A Range of Poetries from Africa, America, Asia, Europe and
Oceania_ (California, 1985). He is Professor of Visual Arts and
Literature at the University of California, San Diego.
 
Pierre Joris has published over twenty books of poetry as well as many
anthologies and translations. He is Associate Professor of English at
the State University of New York, Albany.
 
 
 
"The word anthology hardly does justice to Rothenberg and Joris's
brilliant reconceptualization of twentieth-century poetry in a global
context. This is that rare book that forces us to rethink what the
poetic is and can be." -- Marjorie Perloff
 
"This book is destined to become a fundamental resource for the study
of twentieth-century literature and culture. Its importance cannot be
overstated." -- Charles Bernstein
 
"A riveting literary achievement of phenomenal scope and generosity.
This illuminating compendium displays the best of humanity's bardic
inheritance and vision.... It should be obligatory reading for all
scholars, students, writers, and lovers of poetry." -- Anne Waldman
 
"In an accurately titled Poems for the Millennium we can at last sense
the scope of the Revolution of the Word that's been in process
sinceQoh, 1895. There's no other anthology like this one, no other
overview so adventuresome." -- Hugh Kenner
 
"Rothenberg and Joris's anthology gives us, by virtue of its organic
structure and inspired choices, the possibility of a kind of situated
internationalism.... It is a sourcebook for the future." -- Gary Snyder
 
"This is not like any other anthology, not a collection of
excellences, no absurd imitation of a canon. It's more like a Handbook
of Inventors and Inventions, or of Explorers and Discoveries, that
opens up all sorts of pathways for poetry from its past and future to
a living present... It is above all a book of possibilities and
invitations." -- David Antin

I think that Lightman's encomium for Davie is apt and shd surely be
welcomed. Davie , despite his crankiness in some areas, at least
announced to the stiff-necked English p[oetry crowd that there was
something happening elsewhere. His poetry sounds a little 19thC
English to North American ears, but it sounds a lot more beautiful
than the stuff you usually see printed in the establishment papers
over there. I think that North Americans always wonder how the hell
the Brits ever thought that Larkin was more than a light poet. But
Davie rests somewhere between the tight collar and proper vest, and
Mr Bunting, say. Maybe closest to someone like Tomlinson, who also
had an ear cocked westward. Only time I had a real serious talk with
Davie, though, was once when I visited Essex with a view to doing a
PhD on Bunting in 1966, and Davie sais not a chance, he was saving
him for himself. Better than the prof at Sussex who told me not a
chance, he had heard that this Bunting fellow was still alive.

My thanks as well to Ira for the Davie obituary.  I remember a pleasant
hour spent with him in his office at Vanderbilt University, watching him
continually relight his pipe and counsel me, a prospective graduate
student, that I would be better off pursuing my honors thesis on Bunting
than on Robert Duncan.  When I told him how fascinated I was by the
eclecticism of Duncan's influences, he shook his head slowly:  "Eclectic
indeed--rather an eclectic _fudge_, I should say."  That was my
introduction to Bunting's work.  Later, he would send me a syllabus for a
graduate seminar he had taught on the Objectivists, from which Zukofsky
was unaccountably absent(!); "He would have taken up far too much of the
semester, with too little reward," was Davie's explanation.
        I was inclined to dismiss him as an old fart at the time, an
impression further strengthened by his scathing review of Williams's
collected poems a couple of years later, and his casual dropping
(somewhere) of the opinion that Niedecker was on a par with
Dickinson--both "minor female poets."  But if Davie was never quite
vanguard enough for my tastes, he always remained a staunch advocate of a
Poundian poetics--not a popular position in England, nor in America,
where Helen Vendler takes every opportunity to berate Davie for his
"unaccountable" appreciation of Pound.  [Speaking of which, does anyone
have a citation for the Ashbery interview where he says that Vendler told
him (Ashbery) in conversation, "Of course you don't like The Cantos.  You
have to be a fascist to like The Cantos"?]  He was always a graceful
writer--not a skill valued by many American academics, nor,
unfortunately, by many of those who write about poetry in America--and he
was never afraid to hold unpopular opinions.
        His Pound books remain useful.  His _Under Briggflatts_,while
highly spotty, is consistently entertaining.  My  personal favorite of
his books is _A Gathered Church:  the Literature of the English
Dissenting Interest, 1700-1930_, a lovely and eclectic piece of
historical scholarship and criticism.

A MOO is a MUD-Object-Oriented, and a MUD is a multi-user-domain or
dungeon; these developed out of role-playing games like Dungeons and
Dragons. The MUDs developed into various other forms, and the MOO is one
of them; it's a textual space, a virtual (textual) environment in which
users can both talk to one another in real time, and building/construct
various rooms, objects, etc. - again, all textual. LambdaMOO was the
first, began by Pavil Curtis at xeroxparc; Media MOO is run by the MIT
Media Lab (it's overt virtual space is that of the lab itself); and PMC
Moo, which I'm "active" on, is down at the moment, coming back as PMC2
(post-modern-culture, run out of the University of Virginia). To get to
Media MOO, telnet:
telnet 18.85.0.48 8888
and sign in as guest. Some commands: help gives you all kinds of
information; @go #<number> takes you to a location as in
@go #2014
which will take you to Tiffany;
say <xyz>
results in someone else reading
Guest says "xyz"
@join <name>
takes you to name, and
emote is feeling happy
results in someone else reading
Guest is feeling happy.
There are a number of commands; it takes a while to get used to it, but
becomes simpler as you go along. I've not been on Lambda, which has
thousands of users; Media is almost empty. PMC has been going through a
lot of politics and is changing as I've said.
These programs can run 35-40 megabytes, although the basics are around 4
megabytes; they also run in RAM and are downloaded several times a day,
in case of disk failure. The most sophisticated, like Media, have
libraries and research tools within them, like gopher and ftp access,
usable by groups of people at a time.

This reminded me of in the mountains work I have done; this weekend I was
in the mountains with two women both of whom had their brothers commit
suicide this past year. & one of the brothers had seen The Crow and
wanted to come back as a crow and help people and had said that shortly
before he died. & he hung himself on a jungle gym. In the mountains I
stayed in his room and a week before the anniversary of his death a dead
crow was found in the center of his bed. & everyone is scared.

In-Reply-To:  <199509270403.VAA09822@leland.Stanford.EDU>
 
I too mourn the loss of Donald Davie!  I first met Donald at one of those
Pound conferences at Orono and he was feisty and terrific: I like his
first Pound book very much, ARTICULATE ENERGY even better.  But he was a
very difficult and self-destructive person.  When I published my Frank
O'Hara book, he wrote me a letter scolding me for writing about such a
terrible person and objected vehemently to Frank's being gay.  "The
Muse," he told me, "is female!" and so GAYS CAN'T WRITE POETRY!  An
amazing, absurd letter.  He took the line, "I drink to keep from getting
bored," and said "If he's so bored let him leave poetry to those of us
who are not bored!" etc etc.
 
At some point in the 70s, he seemed to derail somewhat.  Having been such
a passionate fighter for the new, he left Stanford first for Vanderbilt
(which he sadly and mistakenly took for the "Old South") and then back to
England and became increasingly pugnacious and defensive.  I suspect it
was because he felt his poetry wasn't getting its due--and it's true (to
my mind) that DD was much better critic than poet.  But he did write some
wonderful reviews (collected in Barry Alpert's book) and essays on
Pound.  One of the best is the one about a walking tour in Provence and
how geography works in poetry.  He wrote brilliantly about syntax: the
difference a shift to the past tense could make.  But his politics became
increasingly problematic as did his social/cultural attitudes--and so it
was a sad last few years.
 
It's interesting to me that Ira is so keen on the poetry--makes me want
to go back and reread.

Whoops! Sorry to tread thus upon Charles's toes - I'd deleted all
previous postings on this (as I had all Rengas) and had forgotten that
anyone had dissented. It's a nice point, and you could all waste many
legal $$$ on it if you're so inclined:
(a) one refusal to reproduce does indeed scupper the whole collaborative
project, unless it can be agreed that
(b) it was a collaborative project from the outset, with everyone
accepting the possibility of collective revision.
 
I must say it looked pretty collaborative to me, from the outside - but
can I join those urging the Renga set to go into the back room and sort
it amongst themselves?

Good to read so many positive testimonials to Donald Davie. Like many I
grew up with his criticism around me, particularly the Pound work, and
I'll miss him, grumpiness and all. It seemed to fall on me to disagree
with him in public quite a lot - such as (a) when he suggested that the
Native North Americans are absent from Lorine Niedecker's Lake Superior,
(b) when he argued that Bunting was a poet of religious orthodoxy and (c)
when he asserted that Zukofsky wasn't worth talking about. So that when we
met we were both a little surprised to find that the other wasn't as
fierce as we'd expected. The remarkable thing was that he did generally
continue talking about such people when most UK "establishment" critics
didn't.
 
In his south-yorkshire bloody-mindedness ("the Geoff Boycott of
literature" someone said) Davie was very like the late Eric Mottram - a
comparison which would make both of them grumble a lot. But where Davie
came to assert tradition and authority, Mottram remained committed to
everything radical. With mentors like these, what shall we do but go
schizophrenic? And miss them both, in their various ways.

Subject:      Rengas and Williams
 
Although I spoke kindly of the renga and asked to print a piece of it,
it does begin to seem like one of those dancing diseases that they
caught in the Middle Ages.
 
I wouldn't want to make more trouble for anyone, but a few simple
electronic commands on the Buffalo listserver would set up another
list called "Renga" --or maybe "Rengaroom"--no that has too many
letters.
 
Meantime, I think I have come across something that illustrates
exactly what Williams did for us in writing "Spring and All." Compare
that poem with this one, copyright 1911, by Cordie Webb Ingram whose
face peers out with innocent wonder from the frontespiece of her
collection of poems, published by Broadway Publishing.
 
SPRINGTIME
 
By Cordie Webb Ingram
 
It is springtime, happy springtime, once again,
All Nature seems aroused as if from sleep;
The bird's notes thrill us--oh, so clear and deep--
The western zephyrs round us gently sweep,
And whisper promises of joy for pain.
 
There is a hint of active life within the wood;
The brown, bare limbs of winter turning green,
The bare earth woos a fresher, brighter, sheen,
The subtle snunlight steals the leaves, between,
As if these children of the forest understaood.
 
The frisky squirrel leaps from bough to bough
[I don't think I care to type in more about the squirrel]
 
There is a mighty whispering 'neath the soil.
The infant plants anticipate the light,
And vaguely dream of time, when they bedight,
Will flaunt themselves in shades, red, green, and white;
Transition strange, accomplished without toil.
 
[after several more stanzas the poem ends with the assertion that
"sweet Springtime...keeps us daily from the Tempter's snare."]
 
Now Williams:
 
By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds driven from the
northeast--a cold wind. Beyond, the
waste of broad, muddy fields
brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen
 
patches of standing water
the scattering of tall trees
 
 
All along the road the reddish
purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy
stuff of bushes and small trees
with dead, brown leaves under them
leafless vines--
 
Lifeless in appearance, sluggish
dazed spring approaches--
 
They enter the new world naked,
cold, uncertain of all
save that they enter. All about them
the cold, familiar wind--
 
Now the grass, tomorrow
the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf
 
One by one objects are defined--
It quickens: clarity, outline of leaf
 
But now the stark dignity of
entrance--Still, the profound change
has come upon them: rooted they
grip down and begin to awaken.
 
It would be easy to write pages of commentary comparing these two
poems. A couple of similarities seem to me even more remarkable than
all their differences. But Williams's is like some huge and at first
discordant organ blast--and yet completely unpretentious.

Subject:      bland abstract lyrics, or you've got wheat in your eye
 
        Ron Silliman's side comment, a few days ago, that "bland abstract
lyrics" are now the dominant strain of avant garde writing in 1995 is
a criticism that emerging avant garde writers need to pay close attention
to. The silence attending his remark (which, admittedly, he made on the
side of other
concerns) is disturbing. Do the younger avant garde writers on this list
accept Ron's characterization? Are the potential implications of such a
comment (that new avant garde writers are out of touch, apolitical, or
otherwise spaced out) also things that you accept? I think that there's a
far vaster range of committed, intelligent, and innovative emerging
writers out there than such a comment would imply, although it may be
true that there's more bland abstract disengagement than we ought to be
comfortable with. Whatever the truth of Ron's statement, is it acceptable
for younger writers to let an older, justifiably respected writer such as
Ron Silliman be the only commentator on this list on the subject of
what emerging avant garde writers are up to? Would not quiet on this
subject imply a (perhaps unintentional) public agreement,
an implied agreement that we ought very definitely to challenge?

My one vivid recollection of Donald Davie comes from the late 1960s,
at Stanford.  Bruce Franklin, who was organizing an armed militia
(The Venceremos Brigade), would challenge fellow faculty members to
political debates.  Franklin was quite popular with the students; he
was also a quick thinker.  Nearly all of the faculty refused the
offer of a public debate.  (Bear in mind, these teach-ins took place
during a series of three successive springs when we shut down the
campus.)  Davie was the only one who took up Franklin's offer.  The
position that Davie took, which befuddled nearly everyone, was an
advocacy of the value of irony, a position which he articulated based
in part on some writings by Thomas Mann....

Subject:      Re: bland abstract lyrics, or you've got wheat in your eye
 
    My mail system was "down" for a few days so I missed Ron's original
posting.  I am gladly unsure whether my own poetry would be considered "avant
garde," but because I fall into the "young" category I wanted to voice my
opinion.  My poetry is certainly not bland or abstract, altho at times it is
lyrical.  It is also consciously political: in strains of Olson, Howe, Rexroth,
Baraka, Patchen, Oppen, Duncan and Silliman.
I can relate, however, with the generalizations made about young writers today
as implied by Mark's questions.  There are few writers my age  I know  who have
political concerns- or at least who let those concerns show in their poetry.
They may admire the poets I listed but not for the same reasons: that their
poetry possesses attentions to the past and present and regards politics as a
major player in individual lives.
On the other hand, there are more poets my age I have neither read nor met than
otherwise.  I cannot agree that any generational issues can be firmly
characterized while that generation is still "emerging."
As for "letting" Ron be the only commentator about what emerging writers are up
to: well, he's no longer the only one.  Altho, I've learned much from Ron's
writings, and am always interested in what he has to say.

Thank you, Mark, for bringing this up.
 
Since I would very much like to learn from the old avant guardists
I would need some ***concrete*** examples of bland abstract lyrics so as
to avoid them and of nonbland nonabstract lyrics so as to emulate them.

Responding to William Northcutt - I have here a leaflet advertising this bash.
You can get tickets in advance from the promoter, Goldmark, Orange Street,
Uppingham, Rutland, UK, telephone 01572 821 424. They cost 15 pounds, 12 pounds
50 and 10 pounds. But I should imagine you'd get in if you turn up at the Albert
Hall on the day. (Which is 16 Oct, at 7.30pm.)
 
Goldmark is run by Mike Goldmark, the eccentric second-hand book dealer and
gallery owner who championed Iain Sinclair by privately publishing his first
novel, White Chappell.
 
I can't imagine this venture will be other than a financial disaster but I'm
intrigued to hear the mix (Kathy Acker and Sorley MacLean on the same bill? Our
own cris cheek with Ginsberg?), so we shall see...

Hi! I'm Jeff Hansen, and I've just subscribed.
 
mark Wallace's challenge to emerging poets to answer Silliman's claim that we
are producing boring lyrics is worth paying attention to. How many young poets
has Ron read? Should he have much authority if he does not know much about us?
Could he name names please?
 
the reason i ask for such specificity is because, well, of course some of us
are boring lyric writers. but aren't most poets in any generation not going to
set the world on fire? Many of us do not write lyrics, and those that do
cannot be easily dismissed. Can the work of Juliana Spahr be considered bland
lyrics? For heaven sakes, she collages together material that she heard on
Oprah! Is Stephen-Paul Martin considered part of this younger generation? If
so, how can his "The Flood" (Runaway Spoon Press) be considered lyrical? It
uses an electric typewriter to create the most arresting visual poetry I have
yet to encounter. And who's to say that the lyric is entirely outmoded? If
what Silliman wants of a new generation us formal aesthetic novelty, I doubt
he'll get it from us. But, as has often been mentioned, the "make it new"
manifesto is now standard marketing tool for corporate America (new and
improved ERA meets new and improved experimental poetry.)
 
May i suggest that "what's new" about this generation is its abject refusal to
believe that new techniques are better techniques, that we must forge ahead
into the wild blue yonder of aesthetic innovation, etc. Isn't there plenty of
room for experiment, exploration, and expression in the forms already
available? And if that makes me appear conservative, then where do you wnat us
to go? Into poems composed of keyboard symbols such as &***((^%^$$~!@???
Seems boring.
 
The wild blue yonder school of poetic innovation may have hit a wall, because
what's on the other side, after we break on through, might be nothing more
than innovation for innovation's sake.  The advantage of working within the
"avant-garde" network is that it gives us a much wider assortment of formal
strategies, not that it sends us out.

Good question, Graham -- the answer is "none" -- for the 6 pages from
_In Parenthesis_ we wanted to include, Faber&Faber asked a permission
fee of more than $2000 (two thousanddollars), something quite
unacceptable to us. We decided,however, to leave his name in as well
the commentary on his work we had written. Jones is indeed one of the
most remarkable "British", well, anglo-welsh poets of that period &
someone whose work should be known & read much morewidely. -- Pierre

All I remember Ron S. saying was that he wondered how we got from
SPRING & ALL to "bland, one-page, abstract lyrics." It wasn't clear
to me that he meant orthodox or anti-orthodox, young or old, etc.
But I took the "bland" as the principal indictment, guessing that he
didn't mean to suggest that, say, Coolidge or Scalapino abstract
one-pagers were (are) worthless. I'm anxious to hear Ron's response
to all this -- I wonder if he's just letting this all go on to see
where it goes. I'm just as interested to know about Barret Watten's
recent "ambivalence" toward poetry, if Ron feels like filling us in.

I find it an interesting leap for Mark to make that Ron was necessarily
referring to younger writers as being those for whom the air was coming
out of the lyrical balloon. If we accept the bait, that Ron is casting
doubt on a new generation (rather than, say, his casting a wider net of
concern over poetry generally), then perhaps a younger generation will
have to articulate the multiplicity of designs it has on the future of
poetics. Variantly, if Ron's concern is more general, then everyone is
welcome to leap in, and contemplate.
 
Question. Where does the younger generation begin? End? What can be said
to be holding it together? What could be said to be holding together the
previous generation? How do we define the parameters of that generation?
Is it useful to generalize (say, poets from city x like to write about
boats, whereas those from city b are likely to use gerunds a great deal,
and poets who are friends with a tend to disdain representation...). Are
movements in poetry fluid or static? Are poets?

I admire the abstract lyric. I have yet to stop reading anything anyone
here says not to read. I like certain bland things, they cleanse. Is that
transitive? Do I have to give up the blandness of Henry James, or the
blandness of William Carlos Williams, or the blandness of Robert Duncan (a
wildly interesting bland and abstract poet) to appreciate the blandness of
Bruce Andrews I mean badboyness? Mark, I think it will be intensely boring
to defend the younger generation. What Ron asked was, how did it happen
that the bland abstract (one-page) lyric poem became the norm. It might be
better to keep nattering away at how this (alleged) change happened. I
blame the blandness of John Ashbery or rather the blandness of the vapor
that settles over the reader who tries to follow his seductive jumps.
Imitators produce works that mimic his jumps and connections without and I
know I'm treading on you (not you Mark, whose work seems ((productively))
closer to John Godfrey's work) both the cerulean and the gunk. But I'm
wrong, of course, in something like the way Ron is wrong.

I'm glad to see D Jones included. I didn't read his writing until the
70's, but remember him vividly as a man who used to come to have tea
with the art master at my school, the calligrapher and painter
Maurice Percival (towards whom I had ambivalent
feelings, since he was on the one hand enthusiastic and encouraging
 and on the other deeply and conservatively restrictive). So at that
time it never occurred to me that David Jones was anything other

No, I dont have any experience of a "generation" being "held
together". I do have, as others will, companions in poetry, as Blaser
puts it, but these include those poets you grew up with close, as I
with Fred Wah, or Blaser with Duncan; but these companions (despite
what Ed Foster might believe) include long-dead poets too, so that
Blaser includes Pindar, and I would if I were not so shy, include
Shelley.

Maybe we can come to Silliman's challenge from what only appears to
be thje other side.
 
                                                                   Ge

        THE READER & YOU
 
 
 
        When we were sitting in our rows in high school English
class, we
were instructed that we should be careful to distinguish between the
person
who had written the fiction we were reading (usually Katherine
Mansfield)
and the narrator of that fiction. We were given to understand that
this was
a matter of the first necessary sophistication, and that from then on
we
could curl our lip and raise an eyebrow whenever we heard someone say
 
"Katherine Mansfield said in her story . . . ."
        It has taken me more years than I spent in high school to
figure out
that the principle involved works in other places as well. Here are
two such
examples:
        (1) The distinction between the person who writes a poem,
even a
short tidy lyric poem, and the voice you hear reciting it while you
look at
the silent book. That is to say, if you tell me that you re reading
Whitman,
I know that you are listening to the speaker he made up. People are
going
to tell me that I am discussing the persona here. But there is a
difference
between Prufrock and the voice speaking in a Fred Wah poem. Maybe
Eliot has two voices between himself and the reader. Anyway, when
Whitman wrote that his reader was encountering a man rather than a
book,
he was protesting against the fate that he knew faced any writer of
the first
person singular or "ensemble," that as soon as he writes those words
on a
piece of paper he has an other to read.
        (2) The distinction between "the reader" and the person who
is
holding the silent book and reading it.
        Sometimes I go so far as to say that the "author" and the
"reader" are
characters in any story. (The implications are interesting if you
extend this
structure to speeding tickets and marriage certificates.)
        How often you or I have read something in criticism or theory
about
"the reader," and realized that this construct is as distinct from us
as is
Patrick Henry or Spider Robinson.
        Anyone knows that literature is an idea but reading is what
you do.
Literature cant hurt you but reading can.
        (I am of course in my own ant-trap here, because no matter
what I
do, the "you" I am talking about is not the person reading these
words, are
you?)
        So that construct that certain critics like to write about,
"the reader,"
cant do anything about what is written. But if you are reading a book
you
can intervene. You can invent a reading.
        You can always skip page 35. You can read from the last page
to the
first. You can stick pages from a pornographic novel between Northrop
 
Frye's sheets. You can call the narrator of Atwood's second novel
Agnes.
Or you can intervene simply by reading the way you read.
        The person who wrote the book cant stop you. The "author"
cant,
either. And the "reader" doesnt know you exist.
        A lot of what they call "reflexive" writing is simply the
result of the
writer trying to be you. You are the ground of the so-called
postmodern.

I too am thrilled by the selection, by the project itself. But where, o
where, is Mina Loy?  My soul deflated considerably when I paged in vain
through all the galleries... are her poems to remain as fugitive as her
bowery constructions?

SYMPOSIUM: (POST) COLONIAL FICTIONS: RE-READING ELIZA FRASER AND THE WRECK
OF THE STIRLING CASTLE.
 
University of Adelaide, 25-26 Nov., 1995.
 
Contact: Kay Schaffer, Department of Women's Studies, 08 303 5267 direct,

Post-colonial studies within Australia have attempted to re-evaluate and
re- write colonial history to include those people either marginalised or
subjugated by the colonial process. This two day symposium will explore a
different aspect of post-colonial discourse through the exploration of one
of the best known events in Australian colonial history. In 1836 the
'Stirling Castle' was wrecked off the Queensland coast and many of the crew
together with the Captain's wife, Eliza, were marooned on Fraser Island.
Events surrounding the rescue of the castaways, in particular Mrs. Fraser,
received international media attention. In the last 160 years the story of
Eliza Fraser has become the subject of popular myth, fiction, opera, art,
film and scholarly research in the areas of cultural studies, literature,
history, anthropology, archaeology, women's studies, and the visual arts.
(Post) Colonial Fictions will examine critically the Eliza Fraser saga by
bringing together, for the first time, an interdisciplinary team of
academics, authors, artists and members of the Fraser Island community.
Discussions will include feminist analyses of the incident, textual and
iconographic representations of Aboriginal people, and Eliza Fraser as a
creative inspiration for the arts.
 
Speakers on 19th century ethnography, visual arts, and Fraser Island
history include: Ian Mc Niven, Lynette Russell, Rod McNeil, Olga Miller,
Elaine Brown; on 20th century cultural studies and Batdjala representations
include: Kay Schaffer, Sue Kossew, Jim Davidson, Jude Adams and Fiona
Foley. We are hopeful that the symposium will include an exhibition of
Fiona Foley's works and a performance by University of Adelaide
Conservatorium of Music students of the theatre opera: "Eliza Fraser Sings"
(arranged by Peter Sculthorpe/libretto by Barbara Blackman).

THE WHOLE VOICE
2nd National Conference on Poetry, 3-5 November 1995 University of Sydney
 
The Whole Voice Poetry Conference aims to bring together those with an
active interest in and involvement with poetry in Australia. The conference
is a national one and is a follow-up to "The Space of Poetry" conference
held at Melbourne University in 1993. It is being jointly organised by the
University of Sydney and the Poets' Union.
 
The 1995 conference will include poetry readings and papers from poets,
editors, academics and publishers. Poets reading include Judith Beveridge,
Laurie Duggan, Susan Hampton, J.S. Harry, Jill Jones, Donna McSkimming, Jan
Owen, Geoff Page, Margaret Scott, Andrew Taylor, and Richard Tipping.
Paper-givers include Peter Steele, Susan Hawthorne, Rosemary Huisman,
Christopher Kelen, Jeri Kroll, Martin Langford, and Max Richards. Richard
Allen and Karen Pearlman will present a performance of dance and poetry on
Friday evening and Richard Tipping, will co-ordinate a display of visual
poetry. These two events will present other views of the idea of "voice" in
poetry. There will also be time for open readings and discussion.
 
"The Whole Voice" theme was glossed as : "a poetry that speaks as fully as
possible, that allows the repressed to speak, that doesn't reject or
diminish emotion, intellect or craft." The organisers expect this position
to generate debate and creative argument, as the idea of "voice" is
contentious. "The practising writer's idea of voice is an intimate friend,"
comments a poet. "Voice is a literary construction, with all the historical
contingency which that implies," writes an academic. The very understanding
of "voice" is basic to dialogue between all participants.
 
Date: 3rd to 5th November 1995
Venue: Woolley Building, University of Sydney
 
Cost: Early Registration (by 22Sept): $80; Full Registration $90
(Student/Unwaged: $45). Day Full Registration ($50, Day Student $25).
Registration includes Friday evening reception, am and pm teas, Sunday
morning coffee.

Subject:      Re: Donald Davie
 
Nice to hear all the words about Donald Davie. He was, when I was an
undergraduate at Stanford (mid-70's), the most influential teacher I had. I
generally found him warm and kind, rather than difficult and
self-destructive, although I agree with Marjorie that it seemed as if he
became more difficult later. He taught me to hear poetry in a way no one had
(nor has since), as he had an ear which could encompass the music of Pound
and that of Tennyson (at his best, in some poems in the middle of In
Memoriam). He gave me an abiding love of the works and spirit of Christopher
Smart. Those may sound to some here like small gifts, but they weren't,
because they were, in part, a permission to hear and think
idiosyncratically, and with mind, ear, and heart. He also was the first to
lead me to read Edward Dorn, who in turn led me to Duncan, Olson, and
Creeley, and indirectly to much of my work since. I rather think he didn't
approve of places I eventually got to in reading and writing, but I know
that in a way he helped me get there. He certainly had his blind spots, and
some found him arrogant, but mostly I found him challenging in a rather fine
way. He gave quite a lot of himself to students who were curious.

My new neighbor Jeff Hansen (next town over) correctly puts up against Ron
Silliman's "bland abstract lyric" charge poets such as Juliana Spahr and
others. I might add Gary Sullivan, Myung Mi Kim, and more. But Jeff also
seems to pit, against "bland abstract lyric," "the wild blue yonder school
of poetic innovation." While I don't share the implicit distrust of "the
new" which Jeff manifests here, I also like to think that there's lots of
room for liveliness within forms and practices which have been around awhile
or which may be rather quietly innovative and which may not quite merit
"wild blue yonder" status. Is bland vs. wild blue really the dichotomy we
see? Aren't there lots of other choices? Doesn't ear still count for a lot
in making even the most abstract lyrical work rise above blandness?
 
Nice to hear/read/see you here, Jeff.

Subject:      Golding/Bernstein/APR
 
Last week, Alan Golding wrote:
 
Burt K. mentioned Hank's APR essay. I actually think APR has always been a bit
more eclectic than it's given credit for, but its eclecticism has less the
quality of a commitment to multiple writing practices, more the quality of the
startled twitch that one gives when one is suddenly woken up. ("Oops, looks
like we'd better pay attention to this, even if we are 15 or 20 years late.")
To put this another way, it's not yet clear to me that we're seeing, in APR,
more than a kind of belated tokenism attached to one of the big names of LP.
Charles is acutely attuned to these institutional/literary-sociological
issues, it seems to me. I don't agree, then, Burt, that APR has published work
of his in a traditionally APR mode. The poems they've carried are, in my
reading, progressively more blatant gestures of resistance to and satires on
that mode. If the editors don't get it after publishing the last one,
"Memories," then I feel sorry for them. (And if they've already gotten it and
aren't letting on, then good for them.) The real test for APR will be to see
if they start publishing lesser-known or under-published "experimental"
writers, as they do with their flush-left-first-persons.
 
--AG doesn't mention that a chapter in his book _From Outlaw
to Classic_ (U of Wisconsin, 1995), deals with this very subject
in some depth--Bernstein, APR, and the subversive nature of his
appearances there. (Chapter 5, "Provisionally complicit
resistance"). Good stuff--

1) As an old and still/continually emerging poet, I wonder at this
tendency to equate -- new=emerging=young
 
I know for a fact that I am not the only old poet writing new poems that
are in no books -- similarly, I know many young poets writing old
poems,,, and new poets who don't emerge at all --
 
but I'm always willing to listen to good old fashioned intergenerational
grousing -- it stirs my soul
 
Hey Mark -- you can be in my generation if I can be in yours
 
2) Many years ago I asked Donald Davie to autograph a book of his poems
for me (the one about the Shires) -- As he wrote his name, he said, "This
is very generous of you."
 
3) I read Jay Wright -- so does Carole Doreski -- & I'd bet there are
others of us on the list -- assume you know Vera Kutzinski's book
_Against the American Grain_ -- look it up if you haven't already seen it
-- she looks at Williams, Wright and Guillen -- (to my mind she makes
Guillen more interesting than his poems -- that's N. Guillen, not J.
Guillen) --  Special issue of _Callalloo some years back had lots of good
Wright stuff in it.

and this isn't much of an answer: kind of in the: read him? I haven't even
taught him yet! vein.  That is: I've taught Wright's poetry a few times at
the undergrad level, but don't feel I have a very adept sense of what he
does, though I know the Kutzinski stuff on him which I think is good.  It's
interesting, I think, to speculate on why Bloom and Hollander are such big
champions of his work--some of the later stuff is ahem "visionary" ahem but
lacks the tonal mobility and fugitive irony I'd associate w the work of a
lot of the poets on this list.
 
Alan (Godling?) are you out there today?  You probably read and teach
Wright, no?

I've often wondered if the serial poem is the defining poetic of the late 80s

Subject:      David Jones
 
   I was delighted to see the topic of David Jones crop up as
I've been spending a lot of this year (his centenary) thinking about
him. A couple of weeks ago Alan Halsey (of the Poetry bookshop Hay on
Wye) and I gave a joint paper on Jones as illustrator of The Ancient
Mariner and we could see the impact Jones was making on an audience
relatively unfamiliar with him. Members of this list might like to
know that a collection of essays based on a conference held here at
Warwick last April (I was one of the contributors) is due out
sometime next year, edited by Paul Hills. There was also a conference
at Lampeter last weekend, to which I didn't go, but something might
well emerge from that. Seren Books have two new books on DJ due, and
two exhibitions (one in London, one touring) will be opening in a
matter of weeks. I can supply further details to anyone who
might be interested.
   It's a good time just now to be interested in DJ and
he seems no longer the property of a narrow circle of admirers. And
at a time when the poetics and politics of "innovation" seem to be
faltering it may be timely to look again at some of his diagnoses of
the predicament of modern culture. What are the parts (which must be
kept from going sour) to which revision as a solo mission doesn't
reach? If he failed to appreciate, or greatly mourned that culture has
to be about forgetting, he teaches us how to recognise the fragments
that work up through that process in unfamiliar patterns which
reoriginate attachment.

Look again: Mina Loy is in the first Gallery with a 5-page selection.
In the book that's pages 136-140

Subject:      Re: bland abstract lyrics
 
Yet another act of delurking (=lug rude kin):
 
1) Bland of course is in the eye of the beholder, but I suppose one means
poetry that is monotonous, unmodulated *and* unaccented, clever rather than
perceptive, perceptive rather than selective, meandering rather than
directed, vague, hubristic, histrionic, picture-postcard dull--in short,
metrically and procedurally commonplace. A few queries: is the abstract
bland? Can there be a non-bland abstract (there can be a non-abstract
bland, as we know)? By abstract are we to understand a bad case of
conceptual manipulation a la late Stevens (without his ear or eye--or
brain, for that matter)? Is The Triumph of Life bland? Abstract? (Yes on
both?) Is Stein's Tender Buttons abstract (I assume it's not bland)? Is
Cesaire's Ferraments abstract? (No) Is it conceptual? (Yes) Lisible? (no)
Scriptible? (yes) Moving?
 
2) I know that procedural ingenuity or formal obliquity has produced most
of the interesting (to me) poetry in the US in the last 50 years, but if I
am to make any sense at all, I must also say that the very same poets who
opened up and kept open the still lively and living (a pesky romantic
metaphor) forms of poetry around today themselves could be world-class
bores. Being dull seems to be an occupational hazard of innovative
writers--am I quoting here?--who venture into areas to invent them and on
happy occasions (e.g, A-12, Prelude) are able release poetry, on other
occasions (e.g., A-12, Prelude) fail miserably to make anything happen that
hasn't already happened elsewhere to greater effect (in conversations with
Celia or Paul, for instance, to which I am not privy). Who can read
Paterson through without a shudder of dismay? Williams and Zukofsky were
onto something that became important for US poetry in the years after them
and one might well tolerate the bland in "A" in order to arrive at the
sense of design in small matters as well as in large that Zukofsky
undoubtedly (to me) managed to build in. What does this have to do with
poets writing now? I suppose I'm trying sneakily to suggest that in a
survey of any today one must expect a certain amount of the bland, but that
it would be very unlikely if the Americas in 1995 were uniformly anything,
let alone bland. Let's say that an attention to syntax and
decontextualized, rigorously anti-mimetic linguistic subversion/resistance
characterized the underground now overground practice of the recent US
avant-garde. Younger poets writing now, some say the emerging poets, would
I think both profit from this massive exploration of poetry as
unwarrantable language given a welcome charge of distinct audibility, and
want to refuse it in specific ways and parts, just as a reader might wish
Zukofsky had cut some of the beginning of A-12 for poetry's sake (I hope
that expressing such a wish in order to make a point does not mark me as
narrow-minded or condescending--I admire Z and find his poetics both
meaningful to my efforts and succinctly comprehensive). Such a refusal
might well produce boring poetry if it takes place in a vacuum of further
ideas, but imitating somebody else's practice certainly would (and does)
produce boredom all round.
 
It also seems to me that bland lyrics is a fairly good description of the
bulk of poetry of any period (including American poetry since the war).
 
3) By concealing artifice, Williams' respected example has helped to excuse
the general neglect of rhythmic design--in the phrase, line, paragraph, and
work--in contemporary American avant-garde poetry (but see At Passages, et
al.), and therefore, together with Moore and Pound, can be blamed for the
later standardization of voice at the expense of arrangement, perception at
the expense of rhythm, which absolutely guarantees bland poetry. Recent
comments against Williams on this list seem to want to shoot the messenger
of an American voice--one seemingly without art--now that Williams has been
so clearly exposed as the "thoughtless" message in much contemporary
writing. This is unfair. Taking a different direction, I would say that the
fault lies not with the doctor but with the glut of words masquerading as
idea in the discourse on poetry and on literature generally, or with the
loss of -- an energizing loss, looked at in a certain way -- generic
boundaries. Does the word poetry name anything apart from a context of
presentaion? Tell me that the answer is YES. If I am a poet, I must suppose
that I am not writing a context of presentation but a poem. How can I know
that this is so? Circles make me dizzy. Here again, the doctor of Paterson
must take some of the responsibility for at once opening up a wider terrain
of poetry and, one might say, thinning it out and confusing the workers. I
could (as you could) write a list of fairly recent books that work
excellently from the former without succumbing to the latter, but still
areas in Paterson (or Maximus) usefully diagnose the disagreeable vague
monotony some object to in poetry today. The trick, I suppose, is to take
the good and to leave the bad and the ugly...
 
4) But then again, ... (following up on Gale's remarks) are there any
monoliths? states? who gets to count as the younger generation? I can never
shake the feeling that all talk of generations, schools, movements in the
US will remain premature because of the sheer size of the educated
population. And that maybe what one could call a systematic synechdochic
substitution complex--a few people for a whole continent--prompts me to
continue talking about (non-)entities like the state of contemporary poetry
in the US. Oh well.

Subject:      Donald Davie
 
I guess the closest I came to Donald Davie was Alan Shapiro, who was
a colleague for some years; Davie claimed that before publishing any
poem he first showed it to someone who was older than he was and
someone who was younger, and that the younger person was Shapiro.
 
It seemed to me that Davie was following some sort of reactionary
spoor in the United States. He wrote admiringly of Yvor Winters, and
then went to Stanford; then he went to Vanderbilt where I suppose
there was still a lingering odor of the Fugitives, who in their
reincarnation as Agrarians were --well, let's say, as Jeffersonian as
Pound. Donald Davidson, and I mean Davidson, the Fugitive and the
Agrarian of the 1920s and 30s who went on living for decades--was
such a fascist that when admiring his poems one has that awful
feeling as if one were admiring Hitler's water colors. None of this
is applicable to Davie, of course, but his American wanderings had a
very odd pattern to them.
 
I was very put off by a piece that Davie wrote about Larkin some ten
years or so ago, in which he found fault with Larkin for not being a
romantic. It seemed to me it was like faulting Eeyore for not being
Winnie-the-Pooh.

Well George, normally whenever i mention david jones i get blank stares
back. or better yet bad jokes about The Monkees. and as Peter Larkin
mentioned it also seems to me that the critical circle around DJ is
growing rapidly - no longer restricted to Hague, Blissett, Dilworth, and
a few others - but that is a fairly new phenomenon.
 
I did try to get information about the Jones centenary last January on
the MODBRITS list, but i received nothing in reply. i am truly glad to
know there was a centenary celebration for DJ. And Peter, i would really
appreciate any info from the confrence you have, or even a few clues
about the upcomming publications.
 
i'm presently working on a paper on DJ for a course on MOdernist long
poems so am curious to see some new publications and some new approaches
to Jones. The most current work i've seen of late on DJ (i think) has
been Katherine Staudt (or something close to that) 's *At the turn of
Civilization*
 
maybe i'm a sucker for First World War Lit.
or maybe i know a good thing when i read it

Anyone who thinks that (Ron thinks that) Ketjak is the equivalent of the wild
blue yonder simply hasn't read Ketjak.
 
Anyone who thinks that Alan Davies' Shared Sentences is a lexical wild blue
yonder misses the point of form. (Now let's see: I have three toes, and red
and blue crayons do this when eaten and swallowed.)
 
It evidently is continually to be restated: We are not in relation to the
past. We are relation to the present, where (as Peter Larkin remarked
concerning David Jones) "culture has to be about forgetting [and then] to
recognize the fragments that work up through that process in unfamiliar
patterns which reoriginate attachment."
 
That is, group formation indexes itself through the ferocity of its erasures.
Its texts build back in that distancing within the "form" of the village,
setting loose a contingency that in the reading levels any implied authority
in terms such as "the new generation," "the old generation," "the new
sentence," "the old sentence," and particularly "the members of this list."
 
The remainder is paranoia.

Hi. Ken's been posting about this event and I've even had e-mail from NY
describing my photo on the publicity which I myself have not seen yet. A
few choice observations:
 
-      it would appear from the brief I got today that there is
considerable press and radio interest being generated by this event
 
-      the bill is too beefcake for my liking, with only 3/4 women poets on
a bill of maybe 15 performers (I'm told others are being added) / and don't
forget the winner of the poetry competition advertised on the leaflet
(which I haven't seen as I said, heck I'm merely reporting this stuff) gets
to read their poems from the stage alongside us 'alumni'. Made me want to
just invite a mass simultaneous reading from the stalls by all the losers
as my contribution  -  until that is the recent discussion about bland
abstract lyrics got into action
 
-      the promoter is going to spend somewhere close to =A330,000 of his ow=
n
money, and might well lose much of that
 
-      there are two programmes melded together (one offered by Iain
Sinclair as himself, Denise Riley, Brian Catling, Kathy Acker, cris cheek
and Aaron Williamson / this part of the evening will be introduced by
Michael Moorcock (I know, I know, it's seriously weird)  -  the other being
that of the 'official' poetry programme with names as Ken identified plus
I'm told at least an attempt to include Anne Waldman and others /
introduced by that sixties free wheeling drug baron Howard Marks!)
 
-      Penguin books are apparently going to produce a 'memorial' book of
the event and it's being filmed
 
-      for those curious about such things, it's going to presented kind of
rock-multi-media style  -  clip mikes being de rigeur and a giant screen
projecting on-stage 'images' of the performers as filmed by three cameras
in the hall
 
-      popcorn is not allowed in the building (despite which provision I've
agreed to take part), so eat outside

I'm just an old admirer of Jones. My wife is an expert, has the
patience etc. I just pick up items when I travel. Including a second
hand enormous book of the complete drawings tipped in, which I paid
500 bucks for once. So I am not up on the latest. In fact the latest
thing I attended was a couple years ago, the wonderful Eric Gill show
at Univ. of Toronto, just down the street from Dilworth. Did you see
that 1979 item published in Victoria , B.C. by Sono Nis Press? I dont
know whether it was also done in a UK or US edition. It is Henry
Summerfield's _An Introductory Guide to the Anathemeta and the
Sleeping Lord_   Gives references for all the stuff, stuff fr the
Niocene Creed, etc.I was lucky, snaffted that for 4 bucks!

hello,all--
 
i have a querry for you:
i have a very theoretical paper that i want very much to publish.  it is
rather non-traditional (read: non-academic), slightly non-linear, and fuses
prose and poetry.  it asks (answers?!) all those big questions like, what
is a writer? writing? poetry? a poet?  i rely on cixous and derrida (as i
am wont to do!) but include frost, poirier, dickinson, plath, and woolf,
too.  most of these are allusions; the paper is very much mine.  it is a
position paper, i guess, and does not really consider pedagogical issues,
nor is it very empirical.
 
i am considering trying it at either _the american poetry review_ or
_critical texts: a review of theory and criticism_.  my question to you
all is: does anyone know anything about these journals?  are the
reffereed?  do they have a wide/national circulation?  a good reputation?
 
i am btw. that rock/hard place with this one, in that it is fairly
un-traditional, and yet as an academic, i need publications!  i think it
is  valuable paper--but i fear that more traditional journals are not
appropriate; but then again, i cannot go too far off the beaten path, and
satisfy the academy!
 
 
i thank you in advance for your input--backchannel me if you'd rather--

i checked on the story, aldon, and can confirm it's true, tho the woman

included the letters wcw but was otherwise held to be indecent by
university professors who teach wcw and say they can't live without

actually, steve, i like that new jersey accent, and it's almost gone. i
smashed an elbow a couple years ago, and the doctor who fixed it (in his
70s or 80s, i'd say, but did a fantastic job) sounded just like those
williams recordings. i asked him if he'd heard of wcw, and he said, oh,
ya, the guy that used to be at passaic" [i.e. passaic general]. i ran
into a older guy selling real estate with that accent, not long ago; and
the other day a friend and i heard in one of the old bars around here.
but like wcw's world generally, the accent's gone. -ed

As DJ seems to be stirring an interest (and thanks to Larry Price for
inserting him into the Wild Blue Yonder discussion) let me tell what
I know for anyone in or visiting the UK over the next few months.
 
  Two exhibitions: DJ: a Map of the Artist's Mind
    Glynn Vivian Gallery, Swansea 30 sept-12 Nov
    Hove Museum, Hove, 19 Nov - 28 Jan
    National Museum,Cardiff 17 Feb - 14 April
 
 DJ: A Centenary Exhibition Wolsey Fine Arts, 12 Needham Rd,London
 25 Oct - 25 Nov (catalogue already available)
 
   Three new books:
   DJ: Ten Letters Agenda Eds Feb 1996 (but priced at stlg70!)
   DJ: a Fusilier at the Front ed. A.J.Hyne, Seren  Sept 1995
   DJ: the Maker Unmade, By J Miles & D.Shiel, Seren  Nov 1995
 
   Also not yet announced:
   DJ: Artist and Writer ed Paul Hills , Avebury, Spring 1996
   This will contain a new paper by Kathleen Henderson Staudt who has
written (I agree with Graham Sharpe on this) the best book on DJ to
date, "At the Turn of a Civilization", U of Michigan Press, 1993.Also
featured is a piece of Gallic esprit by Jacques Darras on the role of
somnolence in English culture.
  One last general point: DJ is most visible as a WW1 poet (though a
controversial one, given his treatment of war as a recurrent human
predicament,to be rememorated as much as resisted(( for a recent
theoretical reading, see Evelyn Cobley "Representing War" U of
Toronto P, 1993)). More immediate to me, though, are parts of
The Anathemata and some of the fragments in The Sleeping Lord,
especially The Tutelar of the Place, a wonderful trenchant statement
of the poetics of attachment but entirely of the present (DJ believed
art can only be of "the Now"). See my paper "Tutelary Visitations" in
Paul Hills above.
  Sorry for the Jonesian exactitude of all this.
  Peter

Here's hoping you'll both post something in the way of a report on the Albert
Hall festivities after the "reforgotten" appear October 16.
 
For those who haven't seen the flyer, cris gets second prize for best picture,
after Brian Catling, who looks like a cross between a postmodern monk and that
guy from the original Adams Family--was it Fester?--sans light bulb in mouth.
What is that you're smokin' cris?
 
For those of us--me--who know little or nothing about them, who are these
"counter cultural heroes"--as the brochure describes the "presenters"--Michael
Moorcock and Howard Marks?
 
Hell, I thought the only poetry celebrities in England these days were the
New Gen folks.  And not a one of them on the program.
 
The Blaserfest reports were entertaining and useful: great to have more of the
same in this case for those of us who can't get across the pond.

Dear Jordon,
 
Edith Sitwell cuttingly narrates the split between Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu and Alexander Pope in her biography of Pope.I'm not sure whether it
was in this  book that I read that the final blow for Pope's and Lady
Mary's mutually generative partnership involved the return of borrowed
bed-sheets, unlaundered.
 
In any case, Sitwell's bio ought to be read for its curious, long, dense
lists which are among the least banal texts I have ever had the pleasure of
reading. (see chapter XI, Fashionable, Life for these)
 
sincerely,
Lisa

Does anyone know of any commentary on Harryette Mullen's work--essays,
reviews, etc.--and esp., though not exclusively, on Trimmings? You can reach
me via my backchannel, provided you can get past the anal godling lodging in
my Poetic Briefs.
 
Since one or two threads of the WCW argument are still dangling, I thought to
mention a good essay Hank Lazer published a few years ago on different
readings of WCW among recent poets. (Hank, maybe you can post the ref.? I
don't have it to hand right now.) What's being debated, at the risk of stating
the obvious, is competing readings of WCW, not whether any given
characteristic is "really there" in his work. My memory is that Hank lays out
very well what different writers have recently found in WCW, and what
different texts they're drawn to in order to find what they need.
 
Tenney, I appreciate your faith in the breadth of my reading, but I pretty
much lost touch with Wright after The Double Invention of Komo, which I
believe was his first book. And after this bloody (in all senses) trial, I can
no longer read his line about "the broken field runner in the terminal"
without thinking of OJ and Hertz commercials.
 
Jordan: Chap. 4 of my book From Outlaw to Classic talks some about internal
differences/arguments within an embryonic poetic community in discussing the
first series of Cid Corman's Origin. This isn't the chapter's main focus, but
I do get into the issues somewhat. I agree that it's hard to find material
beyond the anecdotal (though that's always entertaining too).

& Steve Carll replies:
 
_Poetry Wars_ by Tom Clark dishes a lot of dirt.  Can't remember what press
it's on, though, or if it's still in print.
 
Clark's _The Great Naropa Poetry Wars_ was published by Cadmus Editions in
1980. Doubt it's still in print. Ed Dorn still won't be found on the Naropa
campus next door to CU.
 
Mary Oppen in _Meaning A Life_ has some stuff on George's troubled relation
to Zukofsky. More material can be found in the volume of his letters edited
by Rachel DuPlessis. Jenny Penberthy touches on LZ's relationship w/
Niedecker, & her cautious letters to Corman (ed. Lisa Faranda) add more.
 
Excommunications? How 'bout any history of Breton & the surrealists.
 
Guess we'll have to wait for Kevin's Spicer bio to hear all about how
Duncan/Spicer/Blaser et al. treated each other, & the seriousness of their
fallings out. Anyone present at the Blaser gig remembers Kevin reading a
George Stanley letter talking about Robin while George sat there on stage
grinning & squirming.
 
Who doesn't remember the ugly ruckus arising from RD's interruption of Barry
Watten's LZ talk. After David Levi Strauss dredged it up a few years later,
the pages of the local _Poetry Flash_ were filled w/ it. All of which did
have repercussions on who people talked to/read/published with.
 
Of course there's more. But even when serious issues of poetics are involved,
going over all this 'dirt' seldom rises above the level of gossip &
personalities. Guess I have doubts about the value of such a study.

Hi.
A hypertext-historical question (set of questions). Anybody here talk
about Vannevar Bush? Anybody here work with Intelligent Pad? Will that
program work on a mac? Is there a prosody of hypertext?

Lisa: thanks for the papism. I forgot/didn't know Sitwell's book and will
trundle shortly to find it. Do you (does anybody here) read her poems?
They've always been brushed aside (when I bring them up) as
sort-of-second-rate Stein. Which doesn't seem quite accurate

When you forget something, when you erase it, aren't forgetting and erasing
modes of relating to that something?  Or, to ask it another way, doesn't the
past nonetheless come to presence, albeit as what is no longer present?
 
Please restate it again for us paranoiacs :-)

Subject:      Sitwell
 
Dear Jordan,
 
Naturally I do read Sitwell's poems, especially her early ones. They-- with
Swinburne-- have become permanent bed-side fixtures. I find Sitwell very
unlike Stein and suspect their friendship and mutual respect tinted
sitwell's poems for some readers. In any case, their projects are quite
different in intent. The detail of Sitwell's attention to the sound texture
of a poem-- the specific variability of effect of syllabic structure on
metre and rhythm-- is almost scientic in its precision-- and beautiful and
funny. Many fairly sophisticated readers apparently thought so before the
New Critics successfully deleted her from serious discussion of 20C poetry.
Maybe this had something to do with her extension of some of the premises
of decadence-- terribly unfashionable-- as well as her exploration of fairy
tale and nursery rhyme as literary structures. I've fantasized for several
years about writing on Sitwell, and hope to get at it some day.
 
Lisa

Yes, I'll be there as the list's own cub reporter, and will file a report on the

Michael Moorcock is a(n ex-) science-fiction writer who edited New Worlds
magazine and wrote a series of novels in the late 60s featuring counter-culture
anti-hero of the omniverse Jerry Cornelius. Lately he's been writing anti-porn
stuff with Andrea Dworkin. I can't remember who Howard Marks is/was.

There are a few of us hypertextual or machine-modulated poetry folk who hang
out hereabouts -- myself, John Cayley to name a couple.  The discussion turns

anyone posted that address:

Lisa and Jordan,
 
This is Kevin Killian speaking.  If you enjoy Edith Sitwell, I know you
will enjoy the forthcoming film "At Home with the Stars #3, featuring
Denton Welch," by the NY videographer Joe Westmoreland, in which I yours
truly play Dame Edith Sitwell in this feature-length version of the life of
Denton Welch.
 
I got to write all my own dialogue, dress up in fabulous clothes and
jewels, and welcome Denton into my London flat . . . serve him tea . . . we
discuss poetry and literature, and Denton's illness and death.  As I was
speaking underneath this wonderful jewel-studded turban, I believe I was
able to channel Sitwell's actual voice: she spoke through me just as Lorca
did to Spicer!  Only this is in living color, and pixel vision too.  Anyhow
watch for this show at an obscure art film festival near you early next
year.  However, Lisa, you are the Sitwell de nos jours, the Edith of
Vancouver, and your pudeur, wit and brilliance when reading will never be
forgotten by any who have seen you read; however, I had the right dress
(one of Dodie's) and headdress, so it is a tossup.
 
Did you know that Edith met, in the course of her career, not only Denton
Welch but Raquel Welch too?   XXX Kevin

>> Tenure inquiry
>> may be dicey,
>> regents learn
>>
>> By Alisa Wabnik
>>
>> The Arizona Daily Star
>>
>> TEMPE - Even the question of how to debate tenure drew controversy
>> at yesterday's Arizona Board of Regents meeting, previewing the
>> intense feelings to come as the board considers whether to eliminate
>> the university job benefit.
>>
>> Board members agreed, 4-2, to hear in the next several months from
>> national experts - both for and against tenure - before deciding how
>> to proceed.
>>
>> But they first rejected a proposal from university presidents and
>> faculty to get their recommendations from a committee of
>> academicians. Some regents said it would produce biased results.
>>
>> ``If all the people on this (proposed) task force come out of
>> academia, then we're not going to have the kind of discussion I want
>> to have,'' Regent John Munger said.
>>
>> ``We don't want to just discuss the possibility of modifying tenure.
>> We want to discuss whether tenure is appropriate at all,'' Munger
>> said.
>>
>> Regent Hank Amos agreed, but nevertheless voted with Regent Andrew
>> Hurwitz against having multiple speakers because he wanted to hire
>> independent consultants instead. Hurwitz preferred the committee
>> structure, while board President Eddie Basha abstained. Regents Art
>> Chapa and Rudy Campbell were absent.
>>
>> Munger's comments provoked a forceful response from Arizona State
>> University President Lattie Coor, who said they violated his
>> understanding from previous discussions of where the board is
>> headed.
>>
>> ``These are matters that affect literally thousands of people,''
>> Coor said. ``If this board intends to seriously entertain
>> eliminating tenure as a function of the Arizona university system -
>> a step so radical that it would fundamentally transform all the
>> institutions - then I think we ought to . . . get this issue on the
>> table.''
>>
>> Tenure has been a staple of academic life since the early 20th
>> century, when universities began offering it to their faculty as
>> both freedom and security - freedom to pursue scholarly ideas
>> without fear of political reprisal, and economic security to compete
>> with higher-paying jobs in the private sector.
>>
>> As of last fall, 2,765 of the 5,507 faculty in Arizona's university
>> system had tenure, said Nor- ma Salas, the regents' assistant for
>> public affairs. About another 1,000 were on the tenure track, she
>> said.
>>
>> ``The concern of the faculty about tenure is not their concern about
>> their personal tenure,'' which likely would be protected by
>> contracts written before any new board action, said ASU Provost
>> Milton Glick.
>>
>> ``It is rather a concern about our ability to be the best possible
>> university.'' Many administrators and faculty worry that eliminating
>> tenure could drive away Arizona's best professors, who could seek
>> jobs elsewhere since most other universities offer the benefit.
>>
>> But regents also hear from community members who view tenure as
>> simply a lifelong job perk for unproductive professors.
>>
>> ``Regents across this country, legislators across this country, the
>> public across this country are all asking for us to rethink the
>> notion of tenure . . . and that's what we're doing,'' Basha said.
>>
>> But University of Arizona President Manuel Pacheco said after
>> yesterday's discussion that, ``There is more intensity to the issue
>> of whether we should have tenure or not than I guess I had read''
>> from previous meetings.
>>
>> Regent Judy Gignac said she hoped the ruckus would not prompt
>> faculty to get ``all riled up,'' akin to the turnout of about 150
>> people Thursday when the regents discussed affirmative action.
>>
>> However, Hurwitz countered that - although he likely would not vote
>> to end tenure in Arizona - ``there is a strong possibility that
>> members of this board will want to look at a variety of radical
>> alternatives. I think the faculty should be anxious,'' Hurwitz said.
